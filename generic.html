								<h3>Data Exploration</h3>
								<p>The data for the project is gathered from three sources. Using the Forbes lists from 2004 to find the most 
									powerful women, a list of 153 have been found, since women often appear more than once on the list. The website 
									<a href="https://littlesis.org/lists/2687-the-worlds-most-powerful-women-2019/members">Little Sis</a> is used 
									to gather all the relationship these women have with important organizations. When creating the network for the 
									project each woman will be represented with a node, but nodes also consist of companies, businesses, schools 
									and organizations that a woman has a relationship with. The Little sis data alone results in around 1.400 nodes in the 
									network. Next, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_list_of_The_World%27s_100_Most_Powerful_Women">Wikipedia</a> 
									pages for the women are gatherd to gain even more connections - if there are more 
									connections available on the Wikipedia pages, then more nodes are created. The Wikipedia pages resulted in about 
									12.000 more nodes that were added to the network. The final network therefore consists of around 13.000 nodes 
									and 18.000 edges, where and edge represents a connection between two nodes.</p>

								<p> <b>A simple example</b> of a node is Hillary Clinton, who is one of the most powerful women in the world. She has 
									an obvious connection to Bill Clinton, which means that he has now become a node in the network. An 
									edge has now been created between Hillary and Bill. Since Bill is now a node in the network, he will both have 
									connections to women and other non-women nodes. In the network there is a connection between Bill Clinton and 
									Barack Obama, since Barack Obama has been added as a node in relation to Michelle Obama who is one the most 
									powerful women.<p>

									Text Analysis will be used in the project and since Wikipedia pages often tend to be written quite neutral, it 
									has been decided to gather the Twitter feeds of the women as well. Unfortunately, only 58 of the women had a 
									verified Twitter account, but the gathering of their most recent tweets resulted in around 111.000 tweets.</p>
