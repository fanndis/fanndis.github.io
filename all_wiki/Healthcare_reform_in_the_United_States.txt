{{Healthcare reform in the United States}}
'''Healthcare reform in the United States''' has a long [[History of health care reform in the United States|history]]. Reforms have often been proposed but have rarely been accomplished. In 2010, landmark reform was passed through two [[United States federal law|federal statutes]] enacted in 2010: the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA), signed March 23, 2010,<ref>{{cite news |author1=Stolberg, Sheryl Gay |author2=Pear, Robert |date=March 24, 2010 |title=Obama signs health care overhaul bill, with a flourish |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A19 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/health/policy/24health.html |access-date=March 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=Pear, Robert |author2=Herszenhorn, David M. |date=March 22, 2010 |title=Obama hails vote on health care as answering 'the call of history' |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/health/policy/22health.html |access-date=March 22, 2010 |quote=With the 219-to-212 vote, the House gave final approval to legislation passed by the Senate on Christmas Eve.}}</ref> and the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]] ({{USBill|111|H.R.|4872}}), which amended the PPACA and became law on March 30, 2010.<ref name="reuters.com">{{cite news |author1=Smith, Donna |author2=Alexander, David |author3=Beech, Eric |date=March 19, 2010 |title=Factbox – U.S. healthcare bill would provide immediate benefits |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1914020220100319 |access-date=March 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=March 26, 2010 |title=Timeline: when healthcare reform will affect you |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/03/23/health.care.timeline/index.html |access-date=March 24, 2010}}</ref>

The following is a summary of reform achievements at the national level in the United States. For failed efforts, state-based efforts, native tribes services, and more details, see the [[history of health care reform in the United States]] article.
* '''1965''' President [[Lyndon Johnson]] enacted legislation that introduced [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], covering both hospital (Part A) and supplemental medical (Part B) insurance for senior citizens. The legislation also introduced [[Medicaid]], which permitted the Federal government to partially fund a program for the poor, with the program managed and co-financed by the individual states.<ref name="MedHist">{{cite web |year=2010 |title=Brief history of the Medicare program |publisher=New Tech Media |location=San Antonio, Tex. |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/2000%20Files/Aug%2000/FTR-08-04-00MedCarHistry.htm |access-date=August 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628194022/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/2000%20Files/Aug%2000/FTR-08-04-00MedCarHistry.htm |archive-date=June 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Ball, Robert M. |date=October 24, 1961 |title=The role of social insurance in preventing economic dependency (address at the Second National Conference on the Churches and Social Welfare, Cleveland, Ohio) |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Social Security Administration|U.S. Social Security Administration]] |url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/churches.html |access-date=August 31, 2010}}
* Robert M. Ball, the then Deputy Director of the Bureau of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance in the Social Security Administration, had defined the major obstacle to financing health insurance for the elderly several years earlier: the high cost of care for the aged and the generally low incomes of retired people. Because retired older people use much more medical care than younger, employed people, an insurance premium related to the risk for older people needed to be high, but if the high premium had to be paid after retirement, when incomes are low, it was an almost impossible burden for the average person. The only feasible approach, he said, was to finance health insurance in the same way as cash benefits for retirement, by contributions paid while at work, when the payments are least burdensome, with the protection furnished in retirement without further payment.</ref>
* '''1985''' The [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985]] (COBRA) amended the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] of 1974 (ERISA) to give some employees the ability to continue [[health insurance]] coverage after leaving employment.<ref>{{cite web |year=2010 |title=An employee's guide to health benefits under COBRA – The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Employee Benefits Security Administration]], [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] |url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cobraemployee.pdf |access-date=November 8, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227210946/http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cobraemployee.pdf |archive-date=December 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
* '''1996''' The [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) not only protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs, it also made health insurance companies cover pre-existing conditions.  If such condition had been diagnosed before purchasing insurance, insurance companies are required to cover it after patient has one year of continuous coverage.  If such condition was already covered on their current policy, new insurance policies due to changing jobs, etc... have to cover the condition immediately.<ref>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ191/html/PLAW-104publ191.htm</ref>
* '''1997''' The [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]] introduced two new major Federal healthcare insurance programs, Part C of Medicare and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], or SCHIP. Part C formalized longstanding "Managed Medicare" (HMO, etc.) demonstration projects and SCHIP was established to provide health insurance to children in families at or below 200&nbsp;percent of the federal poverty line. Many other "entitlement" changes and additions were made to Parts A and B of fee for service (FFS) Medicare and to Medicaid within an omnibus law that also made changes to the Food Stamp and other Federal programs.<ref>{{cite web |year=2007 |title=What is SCHIP? |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Center for Public Policy Research]] |url=http://www.schip-info.org/42.html |access-date=September 1, 2010}}</ref>
* '''2000''' The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) effectively reversed some of the cuts to the three named programs in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 because of Congressional concern that providers would stop providing services.
* '''2003''' The [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] (also known as the Medicare Modernization Act or MMA) introduced supplementary optional coverage within Medicare for self-administered prescription drugs and as the name suggests also changed the other three existing Parts of Medicare law.
*'''2010''' The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], called PPACA or ACA but also known as Obamacare, was enacted, including the following provisions:<ref name="reuters.com" />
**the phased introduction over multiple years of a comprehensive system of mandated health insurance reforms designed to eliminate "some of the worst practices of the insurance companies"—pre-existing condition screening and premium loadings, policy cancellations on technicalities when illness seems imminent, annual and lifetime coverage caps
**created [[health insurance marketplace]]s with three standard insurance coverage levels to enable like-for-like comparisons by consumers, and a web-based [[health insurance exchange]] where consumers can compare prices and purchase plans.
**mandates that insurers fully cover certain preventative services
**created high-risk pools for uninsureds
**tax credits for businesses to provide insurance to employees
**created an insurance company [[rate review program]]
**allowed dependents to remain on their plan until 26
**It also sets a minimum medical loss ratio ratio of direct health care spending to premium income creates price competition 
**created [[Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute]] to study [[comparative effectiveness research]] funded by a fee on insurers per covered life
**allowed for approval of generic [[biologic medical product|biologic]] drugs and specifically allows for 12 years of exclusive use for newly developed biologic drugs
**many changes to the 1997, 2000, and 2003 laws that had previously changed Medicare and further expanded eligibility for Medicaid (that expansion was later ruled by the Supreme Court to be at the discretion of the states)
**explores some programs intended to increase incentives to provide quality and collaborative care, such as [[accountable care organization]]s. The [[Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation]] was created to fund pilot programs which may reduce costs;<ref>Kuraitis V. (2010).

**requires for reduced Medicare reimbursements for hospitals with excess readmissions and eventually ties physician Medicare reimbursements to quality of care metrics.
*'''2015''' The [[Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015|Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act]] (MACRA) made significant changes to the process by which many Medicare Part B services are reimbursed and also extended SCHIP
*'''2017''' [[Donald Trump]] is sworn in as President, signs [[Executive Order 13765]] in anticipation of a repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, one of his campaign promises. The [[American Health Care Act of 2017|American Health Care Act]] is introduced and passed in the House of Representatives and introduced but not voted upon in the Senate. President Donald Trump signs [[Executive Order 13813]] which allows insurance companies to sell low-cost short-term plans with lesser coverage, enables small business to collectively purchase association health plans, and expands health savings accounts.

[[Health care compared#International comparisons|International comparisons of healthcare]] have found that the United States spends more per-capita than other similarly developed nations but falls below similar countries in various health metrics, suggesting inefficiency and waste. In addition, the United States has significant [[underinsurance (healthcare)|underinsurance]] and significant impending unfunded liabilities from its aging demographic and its [[social insurance]] programs [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] (Medicaid provides free long-term care to the elderly poor). The fiscal and human impact of these issues have motivated reform proposals.

U.S. healthcare costs were approximately $3.2 trillion or nearly $10,000 per person on average in 2015. Major categories of expense include hospital care (32%), physician and clinical services (20%), and prescription drugs (10%).<ref name="CDC_NCHS1">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/health-expenditures.htm|title=FastStats|date=July 18, 2017|website=www.cdc.gov}}</ref> U.S. costs in 2016 were substantially higher than other OECD countries, at 17.2% GDP versus 12.4% GDP for the next most expensive country (Switzerland).<ref name="OECD_HS1">{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/health-data.htm|title=OECD Health Statistics 2017 - OECD|website=www.oecd.org}}</ref> For scale, a 5% GDP difference represents about $1 trillion or $3,000 per person. Some of the many reasons cited for the cost differential with other countries include: Higher administrative costs of a private system with multiple payment processes; higher costs for the same products and services; more expensive volume/mix of services with higher usage of more expensive specialists; aggressive treatment of very sick elderly versus palliative care; less use of government intervention in pricing; and higher income levels driving greater demand for healthcare.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/why-does-health-care-cost-so-much-in-america-ask-harvards-david-cutler/|title=Why does health care cost so much in America?

Further, an estimated 77 million [[Baby Boomers]] are reaching retirement age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and federal governments, particularly through [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] spending (Medicaid provides long-term care for the elderly poor).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/media/globalexecutive/coming_gen_storm_e_02.pdf |title=coming_gen_storm_e.indd |access-date=January 12, 2012 |work=The Economist}}</ref> Maintaining the long-term fiscal health of the U.S. federal government is significantly dependent on healthcare costs being controlled.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |title=Charlie Rose-Peter Orszag Interview Transcript |date=November 3, 2009 |access-date=January 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111174416/http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |archive-date=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In addition, the number of employers who offer health insurance has declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from 2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]].<ref name="Kaiser 2007">{{cite press release |title=Health Insurance Premiums Rise 6.1% In 2007, Less Rapidly Than In Recent Years But Still Faster Than Wages And Inflation |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=September 11, 2007 |url=http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs091107nr.cfm |access-date=September 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329111855/http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs091107nr.cfm |archive-date=March 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Even for those who are employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the [[Commonwealth Fund]] published in [[Health Affairs]] estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003.

The cost of insurance has been a primary motivation in the reform of the US healthcare system, and many different explanations have been proposed in the reasons for high insurance costs and how to remedy them. One critique and motivation for healthcare reform has been the development of the [[medical–industrial complex]]. This relates to moral arguments for health care reform, framing healthcare as a social good, one that is fundamentally immoral to deny to people based on economic status.<ref>{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt7zswmt.7|journal=Health Care as a Social Good|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=9781626160774|editor-last=CRAIG|editor-first=DAVID M.|series=Religious Values and American Democracy|pages=85–120|last1=Craig|first1=David M.|title=Health Care as a Social Good}}</ref> The motivation behind healthcare reform in response to the medical-industrial complex also stems from issues of social inequity, promotion of medicine over preventative care.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt183p79j|title=To Live and Die in America: Class, Power, Health and Healthcare|last1=Chernomas|first1=Robert|last2=Hudson|first2=Ian|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Pluto Books|isbn=9780745332123}}</ref> The medical-industrial complex, defined as a network of health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the like, plays a role in the complexity of the US insurance market and a fine line between government and industry within it.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|jstor=10.7591/j.ctt1h4mjdm.6|journal=Third Wave Capitalism|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9781501702310|editor-last=Ehrenreich|editor-first=John|series=How Money, Power, and the Pursuit of Self-Interest Have Imperiled the American Dream|pages=39–77|last1=Ehrenreich|first1=John|title=Third Wave Capitalism|chapter=The Health of Nations|doi=10.7591/9781501703591-004}}</ref> Likewise, critiques of insurance markets being conducted under a capitalistic, free-market model also include that medical solutions, as opposed to preventative healthcare measures, are promoted to maintain this medical-industrial complex.<ref name=":1" /> Arguments for a market-based approach to health insurance include the Grossman model, which is based on an ideal competitive model, but others have critiqued this, arguing that fundamentally, this means that people in higher socioeconomic levels will receive a better quality of healthcare.<ref name=":0" />

;Uninsured rate

With the implementation of the ACA, the level of uninsured rates severely decreased in the U.S. . This is due to the expansion of qualifications for access to medicaid, subsidizing insurance, prevention of insurance companies from underwriting, as well as enforcing the individual mandate which requires citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a fee. In a research study which was conducted comparing the effects of the ACA before and after it was fully implemented in 2014, it was discovered that racial and ethnic minorities benefited more than whites with many gaining insurance coverage which they lacked before allowing for many to seek treatment improving their overall health.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Jie|last2=Vargas-Bustamante|first2=Arturo|last3=Mortensen|first3=Karoline|last4=Ortega|first4=Alexander N.|date=February 2016|title=Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care Access and Utilization Under the Affordable Care Act|journal=Medical Care|volume=54|issue=2|pages=140–146|doi=10.1097/MLR.0000000000000467|issn=0025-7079|pmc=4711386|pmid=26595227}}</ref> In June 2014, [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]–Healthways Well–Being conducted a survey and found that the uninsured rate is decreasing with 13 percent of U.S. adults uninsured in 2014 compared to 17 percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11 million individuals who gained coverage. The survey also looked at the major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found that the biggest drop in the uninsured rate (3 percentage points) was among households making less than $36,000 a year.<ref name="ALONSO-ZALDIVAR :survey">{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_HEALTH_OVERHAUL_UNINSURED?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2014-03-10-03-31-55|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310195507/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_HEALTH_OVERHAUL_UNINSURED?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2014-03-10-03-31-55|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 10, 2014|title=Survey: Uninsured Rate Drops; Health Law Cited|last=Alonso-Zaldivar|first=Ricardo|date=March 10, 2014|newspaper=The Associated Press|access-date=March 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Easly-ACA">{{cite news|url=http://www.politicususa.com/2014/03/10/republicans-darkest-fears-realized-obamacare-number-uninsured-drop-age-group.html|title=Republicans Darkest Fears Realized: ACA Causes Number of Uninsured to Drop Across All Ages|last=Easley|first=Jason|date=March 10, 2014|newspaper=Politicus USA|access-date=March 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Howell-uninsured">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/10/rate-uninsured-americans-dropping-gallup/|title=Rate of uninsured Americans is dropping: Gallup|last=Howell|first=Tom|date=March 10, 2014|newspaper=Washington Times|access-date=March 10, 2014}}</ref>

===Waste and fraud===
In December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, [[Donald Berwick]], asserted that 20% to 30% of health care spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity of the [[health care system]], (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pear | first = Robert | title = Health Official Takes Parting Shot at 'Waste' | newspaper = New York Times | date = December 3, 2011 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/health/policy/parting-shot-at-waste-by-key-obama-health-official.html?_r=1&emc=eta1| access-date =December 20, 2011}}</ref>

An estimated 3–10% of all health care expenditures in the U.S. are fraudulent. In 2011, Medicare and Medicaid made $65 billion in improper payments (including both error and fraud). Government efforts to reduce fraud include $4 billion in fraudulent payments recovered by the Department of Justice and the FBI in 2012, longer jail sentences specified by the Affordable Care Act, and [[Senior Medicare Patrols]]—volunteers trained to identify and report fraud.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bankrate.com/financing/retirement/how-big-is-medicare-fraud/ | title=How big is Medicare fraud? | publisher=Bankrate | work=Retirement Blog | date=February 21, 2013 | access-date=November 28, 2013 | author=Phipps, Jennie L.}}</ref>

In 2007, the Department of Justice and Health and Human Services formed the [[Medicare Fraud Strike Force]] to combat fraud through data analysis and increased community policing. As of May 2013, the Strike Force has charged more than 1,500 people for false billings of more than $5 billion. [[Medicare fraud]] often takes the form of kickbacks and money-laundering. Fraud schemes often take the form of billing for medically unnecessary services or services not rendered.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/May/13-crm-553.html | title=Medicare Fraud Strike Force Charges 89 Individuals for Approximately $223 Million in False Billing | publisher=U.S. Department of Justice | date=May 14, 2013 | access-date=November 28, 2013}}</ref>

===Quality of care===
There is significant debate regarding the quality of the U.S. healthcare system relative to those of other countries. Although there are advancements in the quality of care in America due to the acknowledgement of various health related topics such as how insurance plans are now mandated to include coverage for those with mental health and substance abuse disorders as well with the inability to deny a person who has preexisting conditions through the ACA,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skinner|first=Daniel|date=2013|title=Defining Medical Necessity under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=73|pages=S49–S59|issn=0033-3352|jstor=42003021|doi=10.1111/puar.12068}}</ref> there is still much that needs to be improved. Within the U.S., those who are a racial/ethnic minority along with those who poses a lower income have higher chances of experiencing a lower quality of care at higher cost.

According to a 2000 study of the [[World Health Organization]], publicly funded systems of industrial nations spend less on health care, both as a percentage of their GDP and per capita, and enjoy superior population-based health care outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |title=Prelims i-ixx/E |access-date=January 12, 2012}}</ref> However, conservative commentator [[David Gratzer]] and the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think tank, have both criticized the WHO's comparison method for being biased; the WHO study marked down countries for having private or fee-paying health treatment and rated countries by comparison to their expected health care performance, rather than objectively comparing quality of care.<ref name="fmc">[[David Gratzer]], [http://www.freemarketcure.com/whynotgovhc.php Why Is not Government Health Care The Answer?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312071328/http://www.freemarketcure.com/whynotgovhc.php |date=March 12, 2009 }}, ''Free Market Cure'', July 16, 2007</ref><ref>Glen Whitman, [http://www.cato.org/pubs/bp/bp101.pdf "WHO's Fooling Who?

Some medical researchers say that patient satisfaction surveys are a poor way to evaluate medical care. Researchers at the [[RAND Corporation]] and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] asked 236 elderly patients in two different managed care plans to rate their care, then examined care in medical records, as reported in [[Annals of Internal Medicine]].

A 2001 article in the [[public health journal]] ''[[Health Affairs]]'' studied fifty years of American public opinion of various health care plans and concluded that, while there appears to be general support of a "national health care plan," poll respondents "remain satisfied with their current medical arrangements, do not trust the federal government to do what is right, and do not favor a single-payer type of national health plan."<ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"/> [[Politifact]] rated a 2009 statement by [[Michael Moore]] "false" when he stated that "[t]he majority actually want single-payer health care."

==Alternatives and research directions==
There are alternatives to the exchange-based market system which was enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which have been proposed in the past and continue to be proposed, such as a single-payer system and allowing health insurance to be regulated at the federal level.

In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act of 2010 contained provisions which allows the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) to undertake pilot projects which, if they are successful could be implemented in future.

===Single-payer health care===
{{Further|Single-payer healthcare#United States}}

A number of proposals have been made for a universal single-payer healthcare system in the United States, most recently the [[United States National Health Care Act]], (popularly known as H.R. 676 or "Medicare for All") but none have achieved more political support than 20% congressional co-sponsorship.  Advocates argue that [[preventative health care]] expenditures can save several hundreds of billions of dollars per year because publicly funded universal health care would benefit employers and consumers, that employers would benefit from a bigger pool of potential customers and that employers would likely pay less, and would be spared administrative costs of health care benefits.  It is also argued that inequities between employers would be reduced.<ref>{{cite book|last=Institute of Medicine|first=Committee on the Consequences of Uninsurance; Board on Health Care Services|title=Hidden Costs, Value Lost: Uninsurance in America|date=2003|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780309089319|isbn=9780309089319|doi=10.17226/10719|pmid=25057665}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lincoln|first=Taylor|title=Severing the Tie That Binds: Why a Publicly Funded, Universal Health Care System Would Be a Boon to U.S. Businesses|url=http://www.citizen.org/documents/severing-the-ties-that-bind-business-universal-healthcare-report.pdf|publisher=Public Citizen|access-date=May 20, 2014|date=April 8, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ungar|first=Rick|title=A Dose Of Socialism Could Save Our States – State Sponsored, Single Payer Healthcare Would Bring In Business & Jobs|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/04/06/a-dose-of-socialism-could-save-our-states-state-sponsored-single-payer-healthcare-would-bring-in-business-jobs/|access-date=May 20, 2014|newspaper=Forbes|date=April 6, 2012}}</ref>  Also, for example, [[cancer]] patients are more likely to be diagnosed at [[Cancer staging|Stage I]] where curative treatment is typically a few outpatient visits, instead of at [[Cancer staging|Stage III]] or later in an [[emergency room]] where treatment can involve years of hospitalization and is often terminal.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hogg | first1 = W. | last2 = Baskerville | first2 = N. | last3 = Lemelin | first3 = J. | title = Cost savings associated with improving appropriate and reducing inappropriate preventive care: Cost-consequences analysis | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-5-20 | pmid = 15755330 | pmc =1079830 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Single Payer 101|url=http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Libraries/Committee_Docs/SinglePayer101.sflb.ashx|publisher=American Medical Student Association|access-date=May 20, 2014|author=Kao-Ping Chua|author2=Flávio Casoy|date=June 16, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212220841/http://amsa.org/AMSA/Libraries/Committee_Docs/SinglePayer101.sflb.ashx|archive-date=December 12, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Others have estimated a long-term savings amounting to 40% of all national health expenditures due to [[preventative health care]],<ref name=canadasavings>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-5-20 | last1 = Hogg | first1 = W. | last2 = Baskerville | year = 2005 | first2 = N | last3 = Lemelin | first3 = J | title = Cost savings associated with improving appropriate and reducing inappropriate preventive care: cost-consequences analysis | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 20 | pmid = 15755330 | pmc = 1079830 }}</ref> although estimates from the [[Congressional Budget Office]] and ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' have found that preventative care is more expensive.<ref>PolitiFact: [http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/10/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-preventive-care-saves-money/ Barack Obama says preventive care 'saves money'.]  February 10, 2012.</ref>

On June 1, 2017, in light of the recent Trump Administration’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, California Democratic Senator Ricardo Lara proposed a bill to establish single-payer healthcare within the state of California (SB 562), calling on fellow senators to act quickly in defense of healthcare. The legislation would implement “Medicare for All,” placing all levels of healthcare in the hands of the state. The bill proposed to the California Senate by Senator Lara lacked a method of funding required to finance the $400 billion-dollar policy. Despite this lack of foresight, the bill gained approval from the senate and will move on to await approval by the state assembly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-single-payer-healthcare-plan-advances-1496361965-htmlstory.html|title=Single- Payer healthcare plan advances in California Senate- without a way to pay its $400 billion tab|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-08-06|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

In wake of  the Affordable Care Act, the state of California has experienced the greatest rise in newly insured people compared to other states.  Subsequently, the number of physicians under MediCal are not enough to meet the demand, therefore 25% of physicians care for 80% of patients who are covered through MediCal<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bindman|first1=Andrew B.|last2=Schneider|first2=Andreas G.|date=2011-04-21|title=Catching a Wave — Implementing Health Care Reform in California|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=364|issue=16|pages=1487–1489|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1014109|issn=0028-4793|pmid=21449773}}</ref>

In the past, California has struggled to maintain healthcare effectiveness, due in part to its unstable budget and complex regulations. The state has a policy in place known as the Gann Limit, otherwise entitled proposition 98, which ensures that a portion of state funds are directed towards the education system. This limit would be exceeded if California raises taxes to fund the new system which would require $100 billion in tax revenue. In order to avoid legal dispute, voters would be required to amend proposition 98 and exempt healthcare funding from required educational contributions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://calbudgetcenter.org/blog/can-california-implement-single-payer-health-care-system-without-going-ballot/|title=Can California Implement a Single-Payer Health Care System Without Going to the Ballot? - California Budget & Policy Center|date=2017-07-21|work=California Budget & Policy Center|access-date=2017-08-06}}</ref> The state announced on August 1, 2017 that coverage for health insurance will increase by 12.5% in next year, threatening the coverage of 1.5 million people <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-covered-california-hike-20170801-story.html|title=Covered California premiums will rise 12.5%, and Anthem Blue Cross cuts coverage|last=Karlamangla|first=Soumya|date=2017-08-01|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-08-06|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

In January 2013, Representative [[Jan Schakowsky]] and 44 other [[U.S. House of Representatives]] Democrats introduced {{USBill|113|HR|261}}, the "Public Option Deficit Reduction Act" which would amend the 2010 [[Affordable Care Act]] to create a public option. The bill would set up a government-run health insurance plan with premiums 5% to 7% percent lower than private insurance. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated it would reduce the [[United States public debt]] by $104 billion over 10 years.<ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/277505-house-dems-push-again-for-creation-of-government-run-health-insurance-option "House Dems push again for creation of government-run health insurance option"] ''The Hill'', January 16, 2013</ref>

===Balancing doctor supply and demand===
The [[Medicare (United States)#Graduate Medical Education|Medicare Graduate Medical Education]] program regulates the supply of [[medical doctor]]s in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |title= Graduate Medical Education Funding Is Not Helping Solve Primary Care, Rural Provider Shortages, Study Finds |url= http://www.rwjf.org/en/blogs/human-capital-blog/2013/06/graduate_medicaledu.html |publisher= Robert Wood Johnson Foundation |date= June 19, 2013}}</ref> By adjusting the reimbursement rates to establish more [[Economic inequality|income equality]] among the medical professions, the effective cost of medical care can be lowered.

===Bundled payments===
A key project is one that could radically change the way the medical profession is paid for services under Medicare and Medicaid. The current system, which is also the prime system used by medical insurers is known as [[fee-for-service]] because the medical practitioner is paid only for the performance of medical procedures which, it is argued means that doctors have a financial incentive to do more tests (which generates more income) which may not be in the patients' best long-term interest. The current system encourages medical interventions such as surgeries and prescribed medicines (all of which carry some risk for the patient but increase revenues for the medical care industry) and does not reward other activities such as encouraging behavioral changes such as modifying dietary habits and quitting smoking, or follow-ups regarding prescribed regimes which could have better outcomes for the patient at a lower cost. The current fee-for-service system also rewards bad hospitals for bad service. Some{{Who|date=September 2010}} have noted that the best hospitals have fewer re-admission rates than others, which benefits patients, but some of the worst hospitals have high re-admission rates which is bad for patients but is perversely rewarded under the fee-for-service system.

Projects at CMS are examining the possibility of rewarding health care providers through a process known as "[[bundled payment]]s"<ref>[https://archive.is/20120803210546/http://www.hfma.org/Templates/InteriorMaster.aspx?id=22682 The Medicare Bundled Payment Pilot Program: Participation Considerations]</ref> by which local doctors and hospitals in an area would be paid not on a fee for service basis but on a capitation system linked to outcomes. The areas with the best outcomes would get more. This system, it is argued, makes medical practitioners much more concerned to focus on activities that deliver real health benefits at a lower cost to the system by removing the perversities inherent in the fee-for-service system.

Though aimed as a model for health care funded by CMS, if the project is successful it is thought that the model could be followed by the commercial health insurance industry also.

=== Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation ===
With the ACA improving the health of many by increasing the number of people who are insured, this is not the final stage for the ACA due to the push for a medicaid expansion reform. With the Democrats supporting the expansion and the Republicans against it, it was denied in the Supreme Court in the trial of NFIB vs Sebelius. The Court ruled that implementing taxes in order to pay for health insurance for all citizens was an unconstitutional exercise of Congress’s power under Article I.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sunkara|first1=Vasu|last2=Rosenbaum|first2=Sara|date=2016|title=The Constitution and the Public's Health: The Consequences of the US Supreme Court's Medicaid Decision in NFIB v Sebelius|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=131|issue=6|pages=844–846|issn=0033-3549|jstor=26374030|doi=10.1177/0033354916670870|pmid=28123233|pmc=5230834}}</ref> If the expansion eventually succeeds, Medicaid would become a fully federal program with new federal eligibility standards. This would alleviate the responsibility of state governments to fund Medicaid.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brecher|first=Charles|date=October 2013|title=Medicaid's Next Metamorphosis|journal=Public Administration Review|volume= 73, The Health Care-Crucible Post-Reform: Challenges for Public Administration|pages=S60–S68|jstor=42003022|doi=10.1111/puar.12116}}</ref>

In addition to the reform for the medicaid expansion, there are additional reforms focused on addressing social determinants in the healthcare system through various programs and initiatives in order to reduce healthcare expenditures and improve health outcomes.

Programs and initiatives recognizing and addressing non-medical social needs have sprung from various sectors within healthcare, with emerging efforts made by multi-payer federal and state initiatives, medicaid initiatives led by states, or by health plans, as well as provider level actions. State and federal initiatives, primarily sponsored CMMI (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation) a division of [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]], seek to address basic social needs within the context of the healthcare delivery system. CMMI initiatives like the 2016 "Accountable Health Communities" (AHC) model have been created to focus on connecting Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries with community services to address health-related social needs, while providing funds to organizations so that they can systematically identify and address the health-related social needs of Medicare and Medicaid recipients through screening, referral, and community navigation services.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/issue-brief/beyond-health-care-the-role-of-social-determinants-in-promoting-health-and-health-equity/|title=Beyond Health Care: The Role of Social Determinants in Promoting Health and Health Equity|date=2018-05-10|work=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation|access-date=2018-10-10}}</ref> The model was officially implemented in 2017 and will be evaluated for its ability to affect cost of healthcare spending and reduce inpatient/outpatient utilization in 2022.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/ahcm/|title=Accountable Health Communities Model {{!}} Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation|website=innovation.cms.gov|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref> Under the AHC model, funds have been allocated towards developing a 10-item screening tool to identify 5 different patient need domains that can be addressed through community resources (housing instability, food insecurity, transportation difficulties, utility assistance needs, and interpersonal safety).<ref name=":3">Billioux, A., K. Verlander, S. Anthony, and D. Alley. 2017. Standardized screening for health-related social needs in clinical settings: The accountable health communities screening tool.

Applying this tool in the AHC model will help CMS evaluate the impact of local partnerships between healthcare providers and community organizations in advancing the aims of addressing the cost and quality of health care across all settings.<ref name=":3" /> National recommendations around multi-dimension screening for social risk are not yet available since the evidence base to support such recommendations is highly under-developed at present. More research is still needed in this area to be able to demonstrate whether screening for social risk, and especially for multiple domains of social risk,  will succeed in meeting the Wilson and Jungner screening criteria.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Andermann|first=Anne|date=2018-06-22|title=Screening for social determinants of health in clinical care: moving from the margins to the mainstream|journal=Public Health Reviews|volume=39|pages=19|doi=10.1186/s40985-018-0094-7|issn=0301-0422|pmc=6014006|pmid=29977645}}</ref>

==== Health plan specific initiatives ====
Due to how new CMMI initiatives are, evidence supporting the effectiveness of its various initiatives of reducing healthcare spending and improving health outcomes of patients is relatively small, but is expected to grow within the coming years as many of CMMI's programs and initiatives will be due for their programmatic performance evaluation.<ref name=":6" /> However, it remains that there is more evidence of smaller scale initiatives in individual health plans/hospitals/clinics, as several health plans, hospitals, and clinics have sought out to address social determinants of health within their scope of care''.<ref name=":5"/>''

==== Transportation ====
Transportation is a key social determinant impacting patient outcomes with approximately 3.6 million individuals unable to receive the necessary medical care due to transportation barrier, according to recent study.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last1=Wallace|first1=Richard|last2=Hughes-Cromwick|first2=Paul|last3=Mull|first3=Hillary|last4=Khasnabis|first4=Snehamay|s2cid=220737225|date=January 2005|title=Access to Health Care and Nonemergency Medical Transportation: Two Missing Links|journal=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board|volume=1924|pages=76–84|doi=10.1177/0361198105192400110|issn=0361-1981|citeseerx=10.1.1.114.4660}}</ref> In addition, these 3.6 million experience multiple conditions at a much higher rate than those who have stable access to transportation. Many conditions that they face, however, can be managed if appropriate care is made available. For some conditions, this care is cost-effective and results in health care cost savings that outweigh added transportation costs.<ref name=":12" /> without access to reliable, affordable, and convenient transportation, patients miss appointments and end up costing clinics money. According to a cross-study analysis, missed appointments and care delays cost the healthcare industry $150 billion each year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2010/03/how-behavioral-economics-can-h|title=How Behavioral Economics Can Help Cure the Health Care Crisis|date=2010-03-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref> Patients without transportation are also less likely to take medications as directed.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Syed|first1=Samina T.|last2=Gerber|first2=Ben S.|last3=Sharp|first3=Lisa K.|title=Traveling Towards Disease: Transportation Barriers to Health Care Access|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=38|issue=5|pages=976–993|doi=10.1007/s10900-013-9681-1|pmid=23543372|pmc=4265215|issn=0094-5145|date=October 2013}}</ref> One study found that 65 percent of patients felt transportation assistance would enable them to fill prescriptions as directed after discharge.<ref name=":2" /> According to a recent article published in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', ridesharing services such as Lyft and Uber can improve that healthcare disparity and cut down on the $2.7 million the federal government spends each year on non-emergency medical transportation services.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Powers|first1=Brian W.|last2=Rinefort|first2=Scott|last3=Jain|first3=Sachin H.|date=2016-09-06|title=Nonemergency Medical Transportation|journal=JAMA|volume=316|issue=9|pages=921–2|doi=10.1001/jama.2016.9970|pmid=27599325|issn=0098-7484}}</ref> To recover revenue and improve care quality, some health systems like MedStar Health and Denver Health Medical Center are teaming up with Uber, Lyft, and other ridesharing companies to connect patients with transportation.<ref name=":7" />

==== Housing ====
The University of Illinois Hospital, part of the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System, identified that large portion of the individuals with high rates of emergency department were also chronically homeless, and that these individuals were in the 10th decile for patient cost, with annual per patient expenses ranging from $51,000 to $533,000.<ref name=":8">{{Cite news|url=https://www.aha.org/news/insights-and-analysis/2018-03-06-case-study-university-illinois-hospital-health-sciences|title=Case Study: University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System's Better Health Through Housing Program {{!}} AHA News|work=American Hospital Association {{!}} AHA News|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref> The University of Illinois partnered with a community group called the Center for Housing and Health to initiate the Better Health Through Housing initiative in 2015, an initiative that connected chronically homeless individuals with transitional housing and case managers. In partnering with the Center for Housing and Health, the University of Illinois Hospital saw participant healthcare costs fall 42 percent, and more recent studies have found that costs dropped by 61 percent. The hospital's emergency department reported a 35% reduction in use.<ref name=":8" />

==== Malnutrition ====
Some health plans have chosen to address some SDOH within their own means by establishing programs that directly deal with a single risk factor. Studies show that malnutrition can lead to higher costs of care and extended hospital states with the average hospital stay costing nearly $2,000 per day.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last1=Sriram|first1=Krishnan|last2=Sulo|first2=Suela|last3=VanDerBosch|first3=Gretchen|last4=Partridge|first4=Jamie|last5=Feldstein|first5=Josh|last6=Hegazi|first6=Refaat A.|last7=Summerfelt|first7=Wm.

==Trump administration efforts==
[[Donald Trump]] was elected president on a platform that included a pledge to  "repeal and replace" the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly called the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare). Rather than making adjustments to the Affordable Care Act, President Trump is proposing the [[American Health Care Act]] (AHCA), which was developed by the House of Representatives. If passed, this new health care act would cause insurance and healthcare to return to the market potentially causing for 18 million Americans to become uninsured.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Galea|first=Sandro|date=2017|title=How the Trump Administration's Policies May Harm the Public's Health|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=95|issue=2|pages=229–232|issn=0887-378X|jstor=26300321|doi=10.1111/1468-0009.12255|pmid=28589597|pmc=5461388}}</ref> In addition to this, President Trump pushed for a change in policies regarding "public charge" which would cause the public benefits such as health, nutrition, and housing programs that were previously excluded to count towards considering a person a public charge. The administration has suggested that the AHCA is only part of its reform efforts. Other proposals include allowing interstate competition in the health insurance market.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Incentivizing [[health reimbursement arrangement]]s is another goal.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20181026.832732/full/|title=Administration Moves To Incentivize Health Reimbursement Arrangements|website=www.healthaffairs.org|doi=10.1377/hblog20181026.832732|access-date=2018-12-10|doi-broken-date=November 11, 2020}}</ref>
