The '''Nashville Predators''' (colloquially known as the '''Preds''') are a professional [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. They compete in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) as a member of the [[Central Division (NHL)|Central Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]]. The Predators have played their home games at [[Bridgestone Arena]] since 1998. Their television broadcasting rights are held by [[Fox Sports Tennessee]], and radio broadcasting rights are held by [[WPRT-FM]].

The club was founded in 1998 when the NHL granted an expansion franchise to [[Craig Leipold]]. After five seasons, the Predators qualified for their first [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] during the [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04]] season. In 2008, ownership of the club was transferred from Leipold to a locally based ownership group. The Predators advanced to their first [[Stanley Cup Finals]] in [[2017 Stanley Cup Finals|2017]], but were defeated by the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in six games. In the [[2017–18 NHL season|following season]], the Predators won their first [[Presidents' Trophy]] and Central Division title.

The Predators are presently affiliated with the [[minor league]] teams [[Milwaukee Admirals]] of the [[American Hockey League]] and [[Florida Everblades]] of the [[ECHL]].

==History==
===Bringing the NHL to Nashville===
In late 1995, rumors began to circulate that the [[New Jersey Devils]] would be relocating to the planned [[Nashville Arena]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4DF1F3AF93AA15755C0A963958260 | work=The New York Times | title=HOCKEY; Fans Caught Between Devils and Nashville | first=Neil | last=MacFarquhar | date=June 29, 1995 | accessdate=May 19, 2010}}</ref> Nashville offered a $20&nbsp;million relocation bonus to any team that would relocate, and the Devils attempted to terminate their lease with the [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority|NJSEA]] before ultimately restructuring it to stay in New Jersey.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DA123DF93BA35755C0A963958260&scp=61&sq=nashville+devils&st=nyt | work=The New York Times | title=1995 N.H.L.

In January 1997, a group led by [[Wisconsin]] businessman [[Craig Leipold]] made a formal presentation before the NHL requesting an expansion franchise.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E5DA1038F937A25752C0A961958260&scp=177&sq=nashville+franchise&st=nyt | work=The New York Times | title=Cities Line Up To Join The N.H.L | first=Frank | last=Litsky | date=January 14, 1997}}</ref> When Bettman and league officials visited Nashville to tour the arena, thousands gathered on the arena plaza to greet them. In June, the league granted conditional franchises to Nashville, [[Columbus Blue Jackets|Columbus, Ohio]], [[Atlanta Thrashers|Atlanta]] and [[Minnesota Wild|Minneapolis–Saint Paul]].

The Nashville team would be scheduled to begin play in 1998 if they met the NHL requirement of selling 12,000 season tickets before March 31, 1998.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E7D9163EF93BA25755C0A961958260&scp=185&sq=nashville+franchise&st=nyt | work=The New York Times | title=N.H.L. Names 4 Cities For Its New Franchises | date=June 18, 1997 | accessdate=May 19, 2010}}</ref> Of the four cities, Nashville was the only one with a completed arena and therefore began play first. One month later, Leipold named former [[Washington Capitals]] general manager [[David Poile]] as the franchise's first general manager.<ref>"NHL Expansion Franchise Nashville Chooses Poile For GM".''[[Boston Globe]]''. July 10, 1997.</ref> [[Portland Pirates]]' head coach [[Barry Trotz]] was named the franchise's first head coach on August 6.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|title=Nashville Predators Timeline|url=http://www.wsmv.com/sports/13383940/detail.html|publisher=WSMV|accessdate=28 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108112928/http://www.wsmv.com/sports/13383940/detail.html|archivedate=January 8, 2009|location=Nashville, TN|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On September 25, 1997, Leipold and team president Jack Diller held a press conference where they unveiled the franchise's new logo, a [[saber-toothed cat]] (''[[Smilodon]] floridanus'').<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The logo was a reference to a partial ''Smilodon'' skeleton found beneath downtown Nashville in 1971 during construction of the [[First American National Bank]] building, now the [[UBS Tower (Nashville)|UBS Tower]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ingram|first=Tom|title = Specialists to Study Cave Bones|newspaper = [[Nashville Tennessean]]|page=7|date=October 2, 1971}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guilday|first=John E.|title=Sabertooth Cat, Smilodon Floridanus (Leidy), and Associated Fauna From a Tennessee Cave (40DV40), the First American Bank Site.|journal=Journal of the Tennessee Academy of Science|volume=52|issue=3|pages=84–94|date=July 1977}}</ref>

Once the logo was unveiled, the franchise held a vote among fans to choose a name. Three candidates were culled from 75: "Ice Tigers," "Fury" and "Attack." Leipold added his own submission to the vote, "Predators." On November 13, Leipold revealed at a press conference that his submission had won out and that the new franchise would be known as the "Nashville Predators."<ref name="autogenerated1" />

When awarded a franchise, the city of Nashville paid 31.50% of the $80&nbsp;million fee to join the league. The city has engaged an affiliate of the team to operate the arena, and that agreement protects the city against annual arena operating losses over approximately $3.8&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Donald W.|title=Metropolitan Nashville Council, Analysis Report for April 15, 2008|url=http://www.nashville.gov/council/docs/analysis/080415.pdf|website=nashville.gov|publisher=Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528003339/http://www.nashville.gov/council/docs/analysis/080415.pdf|archivedate=May 28, 2010|date=15 April 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The $15&nbsp;million payroll of the team was the lowest of the NHL.<ref name=si/>

===Early years (1998–2005)===
The Predators began play during the [[1998–99 NHL season|1998–99]] season, taking to the ice for the first time on October 10, 1998, where they lost 1–0 at home to the [[Florida Panthers]]. It was the only sold out game of the Predators' first five bouts in Nashville.<ref name=si/> Three nights later, on October 13, they defeated the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] 3–2 for their first win. Forward [[Andrew Brunette]] scored the first goal. The Predators, in their first year of existence, finished second-to-last in the Western Conference with a 28–47–7 record. In the [[1999–2000 NHL season|1999–2000]] season, the Predators finished with a similar record to the previous season, and finished last in the Western Conference behind the [[Calgary Flames]]. However, during a game versus the [[New York Islanders]] on February 20, 2000, the Predators scored four goals in 3 minutes and 38 seconds.

To begin the [[2000–01 NHL season|2000–01]] season, the Predators played two games in [[Japan]] against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. Each team won a game in front of the largest crowds ever to see a hockey game in Japan. Backed by the goaltending duo of [[Mike Dunham]] and [[Tomáš Vokoun|Tomas Vokoun]], Nashville finished the season in tenth place in the Western Conference, ten points out of a playoff spot with a total of 80 total points. During the [[2001–02 NHL season|2001–02]] season, the Predators recorded their 100th victory on December 6, 2001. With that win, Nashville became the second-fastest expansion team of the 1990s to reach the 100-win plateau. In the [[2002–03 NHL season|2002–03]] season, head coach Barry Trotz broke the record for most games coached by the original coach of an expansion team (392 games).

The club had failed to qualify for the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] for their first five years as a franchise. However, in the [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04]] season, the Predators finished eighth in the Western Conference, qualifying for their first post-season berth. The Predators were eliminated by the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in six games in the first round of the [[2004 Stanley Cup playoffs]]. The following [[2004–05 NHL season|2004–05]] season was wiped out by a [[2004-05 NHL Lockout|labor dispute between NHL owners and players]].

===After the lockout (2005–2014)===
[[File:Chris Mason.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chris Mason (ice hockey)|Chris Mason]] became the ninth goaltender to score a goal in the NHL during the [[2005–06 Nashville Predators season|2005–06]] season.]]
In the [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06]] season, the Predators set an NHL record by winning their first four games by one goal each (although two of those were shootout victories, which would have been tie games in previous seasons). They also became only the fourth NHL franchise to start the season 8–0; the last time a team did so was the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], who set the mark with a 10–0 start in the [[1993–94 NHL season|1993–94]] season. The Predators set the franchise mark for wins in a season with a 2–0 shutout of the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]] on March 16, 2006. In that match, [[Chris Mason (ice hockey)|Chris Mason]] became the ninth goaltender to score a goal. By the end of the season, the Predators had accumulated 106 points—their first 100-point season—and clinched home ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs for the first time in team history. They finished the season with an NHL-best 32–8–1 record at home. However, the Predators would be eliminated by the [[San Jose Sharks]] in five games in the first round of the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|2006 playoffs]].

During the off-season, the Predators acquired veteran center [[Jason Arnott]] from free agency on July 2, 2006. In the [[2006–07 NHL season|following season]], Arnott and [[David Legwand]] led the team in goals with 27 each. Late in the season, the Predators traded two former first round draft picks, [[Scottie Upshall]] and [[Ryan Parent]], plus their first and third-round pick in the [[2007 NHL Entry Draft]], to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] for five-time NHL All-Star [[Peter Forsberg]]. The Predators finished the season ranked fourth in the Western Conference with a franchise record 110 points, finishing third overall behind the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and the Red Wings. They were defeated by the Sharks in the first round of the [[2007 Stanley Cup playoffs|2007 playoffs]] for the second year in a row, losing the series 4–1.

The roster saw a depletion in talent during the off-season. With multiple potential buyers, and rumors of the franchise moving hounding the team until almost mid-season, the Predators were not expected to be successful during the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08]] season. Chris Mason, former backup goaltender to Tomas Vokoun (who was traded to the [[Florida Panthers]]) had a shaky season and shared net-minding duties with [[Dan Ellis]]. Ellis, who was signed from the [[Dallas Stars]] before the season began, had a 233:39 long shutout streak (fifth longest in league history) nearing the end of the season that helped Nashville attain the eighth playoff spot with 91 points. The Predators met the [[Presidents' Trophy]]-winning (and eventual Stanley Cup winners) Red Wings in the first round of the playoffs and were defeated 4–2, their fourth-straight first-round knockout.

====New ownership group====
The first off-season of settling in under new ownership was a quiet one for the Predators with little personnel movement. As such, the Predators began the [[2008–09 NHL season|2008–09]] season with little expectation. Following a strong push after the All-Star break and no movement at the trade deadline, the team found themselves still battling for a playoff spot into the last week of the season. Buoyed by the return of [[Steve Sullivan]] after almost two seasons recovering from a back injury, the Predators finished with 88 points, settling for tenth place in the Western Conference, missing the [[2009 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]] for the first time in five seasons.
[[File:Colin Wilson Predators.jpg|thumb|The [[2009–10 Nashville Predators season|2009–10]] season saw the debut of [[Colin Wilson (ice hockey)|Colin Wilson]] with the Predators.]]
The Predators made few major additions to their roster in the 2009 off-season, signing former [[San Jose Sharks]] forward [[Marcel Goc]] (who was extended for another year by the club in mid-season) and former [[Montreal Canadiens]] defenseman [[Francis Bouillon]]. The [[2009–10 NHL season|2009–10]] season also saw the much-anticipated debut of top prospect [[Colin Wilson (ice hockey)|Colin Wilson]]. However, due to a groin injury suffered in training camp, Wilson spent the first week-and-a-half of the season on the sidelines, and was sent to the [[Milwaukee Admirals]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) in November. He returned to the club in February and scored 11 points in his next 15 games and finished the season with 15 points in 35 games. 2010 also saw a breakout year for the last pick in the [[2005 NHL Entry Draft|2005 Draft]], [[Patric Hörnqvist|Patric Hornqvist]], as the 23-year-old Swede scored 30 in the 2009–10 season, becoming the fourth Predator to do so (the others being Steve Sullivan, [[Paul Kariya]] and Jason Arnott). The Predators qualified for the [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs|2010]] playoffs, facing the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in the first round. The Predators earned their first postseason road win on April 16, 2010 when they beat the Blackhawks 4–1 at the [[United Center]], although they lost the overall series in six games.

On July 9, 2010, the Predators announced that defenseman [[Shea Weber]] would become the club's fifth [[captain (ice hockey)|captain]]. In the following years' [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]], the Predators advanced to the second round of the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. They defeated the [[Anaheim Ducks]] in the first round, winning the fourth game of the series at Bridgestone Arena on April 24, 2011. Two days prior, Predators' goaltender Pekka Rinne was nominated as a [[Vezina Trophy]] finalist for his performance during the [[2010–11 NHL season|2010–11]] season.<ref>[http://www.ontheforecheck.com/2011/4/22/2126208/pekka-rinne-finalist-vezina-trophy-tim-thomas Pekka Rinne named a finalist for Vezina Trophy], ontheforecheck.com, April 22, 2011.</ref> The Predators played against the number-one ranked team in the NHL in the second round, the [[Vancouver Canucks]]. The Predators lost the series 4–2.

On June 22, 2011, the Predators unveiled their modified logo set for the 2011–12 season. With the color scheme simplified to blue, gold and white and eliminating orange, silver and steel, the Predators cleaned up their primary logo and wordmark. A new alternate logo incorporating elements from a guitar pick and the [[Flag of Tennessee|Tennessee state flag]] was also introduced.<ref>{{cite news|title=Preds Unveil New Logos|url=https://www.nhl.com/predators/news/preds-unveil-new-logos/c-566603|publisher=NHL Enterprises, L.P.|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=May 31, 2018}}</ref>

In the beginning of the [[2011–12 NHL season|2011–12]] season, on November 3, 2011, the Predators signed goaltender Pekka Rinne to a seven-year, $49&nbsp;million deal. It was the largest contract awarded in Predators' history, as well as making Rinne the highest paid goaltender in the NHL that year. On February 27, 2012, during the NHL's trade deadline, the Predators acquired [[Andrei Kostitsyn]] and [[Paul Gaustad]] from the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and the [[Buffalo Sabres]], respectively. The Predators surrendered draft picks to bolster their team for the [[2012 Stanley Cup playoffs|2012 playoffs]]. The season also saw the return of Russian forward [[Alexander Radulov]] to the Predators after a four-year hiatus to play in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL). For the second year in a row, and the second time in the team's history, the Predators won a first-round series in the Stanley Cup playoffs, defeating the Red Wings in a best-of-seven series 4–1.<ref>{{cite news|title=Predators Eliminate Redwings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/sports/hockey/nhl-hockey-roundup.html|accessdate=21 April 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 April 2012}}</ref> However, for the second year in a row, the Predators were ousted in the Western Conference second round, this time to the [[Phoenix Coyotes]].
[[File:Sheaweber.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Predators signed [[Shea Weber]] to a 14-year contract in 2013, after the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] made a front-loaded [[offer sheet]] for Weber.]]
The following [[2012–13 NHL season|2012–13]] season as a result of the [[2012–13 NHL lockout]]. The Predators failed to qualify for the playoffs in the shortened season, the first time they failed to do so since the 2008-09 season. After the season, the Predators signed Weber through a front-loaded $110&nbsp;million, 14-year [[offer sheet]], $68&nbsp;million of it as a signing bonus, from the Philadelphia Flyers on July 19. The offer sheet was the richest in NHL history in terms of total money, money per season, and length, surpassing the previous offer sheet record set by [[Thomas Vanek]].

The [[2013–14 NHL season|following season]] saw the departure of center [[David Legwand]], the first player ever drafted by the Predators, the club's all-time leading scorer, and was co-leading scorer for the season at the time. Agreeing to waive his "[[No trade clause|no-trade clause]]", he was traded on March 5, 2014, to his hometown team, the Detroit Red Wings, in exchange for prospect forward [[Calle Järnkrok|Calle Jarnkrok]], forward [[Patrick Eaves]] and a third-round pick in the upcoming [[2014 NHL Entry Draft]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/nhl/predators/2014/03/05/nashville-predators-trade-david-legwand-to-detroit-red-wings/6086919/|title=Nashville Predators trade David Legwand to Detroit Red Wings|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2018-02-25}}</ref> After missing the playoffs for a second season in a row, the Predators opted not to renew the contract of Barry Trotz as its head coach after 15 years, although he was offered an unnamed position within the organization. On May 6, 2014, the Predators announced [[Peter Laviolette]] as their new head coach.

===Peter Laviolette era (2014–2020)===
In Peter Laviolette's [[2014–15 NHL season|first season]] as the Predators' head coach, the Predators finished second in the Central Division. Despite having home advantage in the first round of the [[2015 Stanley Cup playoffs|2015 playoffs]], they lost the first round in six games to the Chicago Blackhawks, who went on to win the Stanley Cup. For the following [[2015–16 NHL season|2015–16]] season, the Predators name [[Sean Henry (administrator)|Sean Henry]] CEO and then finished as the Western Conference's first wild-card, earning 96 points. When they advanced to the second-round after beating the Anaheim Ducks in Game 7, it was the franchise's first seven-game series and seven-game series win. They were eliminated in seven games by the San Jose Sharks, who went on to win the conference.
[[File:PK Subban 2017-06-08 1.jpg|thumb|[[P. K. Subban]] during the [[2017 Stanley Cup Finals]]. The Predators traded Shea Weber to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] for Subban in 2016.]]
In the 2016 off-season, on June 29, 2016, the Predators traded Weber to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in exchange for defenseman [[P. K. Subban]]. The trade surprised many hockey fans because the details to this trade were kept strictly confidential until the deal was already made. On September 7, 2016, the Predators announced [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]] would replace Weber as the sixth captain of the club.

====First Stanley Cup Finals appearance====
In the [[2016–17 NHL season|2016–17]] season, the Predators finished fourth in the Central Division with 94 points, which earned them the second wild card spot in the Western Conference. The [[2016–17 NHL season|2016–17]] season marked the first time the Predators sold out all 41 regular season home games. Their eighth-place finish in the conference gave them a first-round Stanley Cup playoff matchup against the Chicago Blackhawks, who finished first in the conference during the regular season.

The Predators [[Whitewash (sport)|swept]] the Blackhawks in four games. This was the first time that an eighth [[seed (sports)|seed]] swept a playoff series against the top seed in the conference in NHL history as well as the first time that there had been a sweep by an eighth seed against a top seed in a best-of-seven playoff series in the history of North American major league professional sports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wkrn.com/2017/04/20/predators-sweep-blackhawks-with-4-1-win/|title=Predators sweep Blackhawks with 4-1 win|first=Cory|last=Curtis|date=April 21, 2017|website=wkrn.com}}</ref> In the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Predators defeated the [[St. Louis Blues]] in six games, marking the first time the team advanced to the Western Conference Finals.

==Team information==
===Facilities===
[[File:Bridgestone Arena (Northeast corner).JPG|thumb|The Predators have played their home games at [[Bridgestone Arena]] since 1998.]]
The Nashville Predators have played their home games at [[Bridgestone Arena]] since their inaugural season in 1998. Opened in 1996, Bridgestone Arena is a multi-purpose venue in downtown Nashville. The Predators' practice facility is located at [[Centennial Sportsplex]], a multi-use athletic complex located next to [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]]. Both facilities are owned by the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County.

===Fan traditions===
Fans of the Nashville Predators have modified [[Legend of the Octopus|the octopus-throwing tradition]] of [[Detroit Red Wings]] fans to show their support: on occasion, a fan will throw a [[catfish]] onto the ice. ''[[The Tennessean]]'' newspaper of Nashville cites the first instance of this as being on October 30, 2003.<ref>Tennessean.com, [https://archive.is/20120913190944/http://www.tennessean.com/sports/predators/archives/03/11/42549488.shtml?Element_ID=42549488/ Catfish hunters: Fans throw a curve at Preds]</ref> On May 16, 2017, during Game 3 of the [[NHL Western conference finals|Western Conference Final]] at [[Bridgestone Arena]], country music singer, songwriter, and record producer [[Keith Urban]], who had performed the [[National anthem of the united states|National Anthem]] prior to the game, was seen on the Jumbotron hoisting a massive catfish that [[Tennessee Titans]] left tackle, [[Taylor Lewan]] had with him at the game.<ref>{{Twitter|id=Bear_Caldwell/status/864672302704754688|name=Barrett Caldwell}}</ref> Lewan, along with fellow Titans offensive linemen [[Jack Conklin]], [[Quinton Spain]], [[Ben Jones (offensive lineman)|Ben Jones]], and [[Josh Kline|Josh Klein]], and Titans quarterback [[Marcus Mariota]], served as the hype men prior to the game, another Predators playoff tradition prior to home games, which included them waving gold Predators towels, Mariota encouraging the crowd to get louder, Lewan hoisting the catfish, and the offensive linemen chugging beer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/NHL/status/864642317965291520|title=Marcus Mariota and the @Titans Offensive Line are hyped for some #StanleyCup Playoff hockey.pic.twitter.com/Oh8QLd14Jy|last=NHL|date=May 16, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180313170128/https://twitter.com/NHL/status/864642317965291520|archive-date=March 13, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=March 13, 2018|df=mdy-all}}{{Primary source inline|date=December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wsmv.com/story/35449022/keith-urban-titans-offensive-line-hype-up-preds-fans-at-playoff-game|title=Keith Urban, Titans Offensive Line Hype Up Preds Fans a Playoff Game|last=Apel|first=Kara|date=May 17, 2017|access-date=March 13, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180313170532/http://www.wsmv.com/story/35449022/keith-urban-titans-offensive-line-hype-up-preds-fans-at-playoff-game|archive-date=March 13, 2018|url-status=dead|publication-date=May 31, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Section 303 is where a section of fans at the Bridgestone Arena sit, stand, and cheer, colloquially known as ''The Cellblock''. The group refers to themselves as "the loudest section of the loudest arena in the NHL."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=9821|title=Section 303: I came, I saw - I yawned|first=Dominic|last=Bonvissuto|newspaper=Nashville City Paper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220726/http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=9821|archive-date=September 27, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The fan-based organization has been recognized by the Predators' front office. A large banner was produced by the front office for posting on the wall behind the section.

On April 3, 2008, with the Predators clinging to a 3–2 lead with 4:30 in their final home game of the regular season, a sellout crowd at what was then known as the [[Bridgestone Arena|Sommet Center]], gave the team a [[standing ovation]] through the entirety of the final [[Television timeout|TV timeout]]. The Predators went on to win the game against the [[St. Louis Blues]] and advanced to the [[2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs|playoffs that year]], where the "standing O" during the final TV timeout has since become a fan tradition.

The mascot of the Predators is [[Gnash (mascot)|Gnash]], a blue saber-toothed cat. Introduced in 1998, Gnash's trademark includes stunts, such as very fast rappels, zip lines, and a pendulum swing that takes him under the scoreboard and just inches off the ice. To go along with the saber-toothed cat mascot, Predators fans proudly use their ''Fang Fingers'' during each [[Power play (sporting term)|power play]] of the game. There are foam saber-fang gloves that can be purchased, but most fans simply curl their index and middle fingers on each hand into fang shapes and brandish them in an up-and-down motion. Fang Fingers are done to the horror sounds from the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] movie, ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://predators.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=527289|title=An Introduction To Smashville|website=National Hockey League|agency=Nashville Predators|date=27 April 2010}}</ref>

Fans are also known for a variety of chants taunting players of the opposing team, particularly the goalie. For example, after each Predators goal, fans call the opposing goalie's name, accompanied by shouts of "It's all your fault" and other epithets. These cheers are sometimes said to originate from tradition at college football games,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Godfrey|first1=Steven|title=How the Nashville Predators built a fan base in the heart of college football country|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/2015/4/17/8429653/nashville-predators-fan-base-nhl-hockey-south-stanley-cup-playoffs|website=SBNation.com|publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc]]|date=17 April 2015}}</ref> but some of these derive from traditions held by fans of Nashville's former pre-NHL hockey teams [[Nashville Dixie Flyers]], [[Nashville South Stars]], [[Pensacola Ice Flyers|Nashville Knights]], and [[Nashville Ice Flyers|Nashville Nighthawks/Nashville Ice Flyers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/stte/nashville-knights-7022.html|title=Nashville Knights hockey team statistics and history at hockeydb.com|website=hockeydb.com}}</ref> Nashville's fanbase is said by many to be among the loudest in the [[National Hockey League]], with sound levels reaching over 120&nbsp;dB during the playoffs. This has contributed to the team also being called "Smashville".<ref>{{cite web|title=Preds' postseason run has turned Music City into Smashville|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nhl/story/preds-postseason-run-has-turned-music-city-into-smashville-051117-2|publisher=Fox Sports|agency=Associated Press|date=11 May 2017}}</ref>

===Jersey and logo===
[[File:Nashville Predators Alternate Logo.svg|thumb|150px|Nashville's third jersey logo (2001–2007); a more detailed, three-quarters front view of the team's [[Smilodon|saber-toothed cat]] logo.]]

The original Predators uniforms were worn from 1998 to 2007 and both featured a silver yoke on the shoulder. Navy and white were the base uniform colors while gold was used only as an accent color. The white uniforms featured the primary Predators logo outside a navy triangle while the navy uniforms use the same logo minus the triangle. From 1998 to 2004 the secondary logo featuring the Gaylord Center (now Bridgestone Arena) tower adorned the shoulders.

From 2001 to 2007 the Predators wore mustard gold third jerseys featuring the front-facing saber-toothed cat logo. The logo then replaced the tower alternate logo on the shoulders of their primary uniforms in 2005.

Switching to [[Reebok]]'s Edge template in 2007, the Predators made minor tweaks to their uniforms. Most notably, the white uniforms no longer featured a contrasting nameplate color, while the city name was added above the Predators logo.

From 2009 to 2011, the Predators wore navy third jerseys but with black replacing gold as trim color. A roundel logo featuring the fossilized cat adorned the shoulders while a checkerboard pattern of black and navy squares adorned the sleeves, tail stripes and socks.

For the 2011–12 season, the Nashville Predators changed their jersey design and color scheme. The home jerseys are a bright gold with navy and white highlights, while the away jerseys are white with gold and navy highlights. Furthermore, the Predators changed their logo, making it purely white, gold and navy. The jerseys have a guitar pick on the shoulder with the [[Flag of Tennessee|Tennessee state tri-star]] inside it, lines reminiscent of guitar strings on the numbers, and piano keys along the neck line inside the jersey as a nod to Nashville's internationally-known music heritage. From the 2016–17 season gold helmets became a permanent part of the home uniform, after they first used them on Saturday home games the prior season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bratten|first=Brooks|title=Preds Adopt Gold Helmets for Every Home Game|url=https://www.nhl.com/predators/news/predators-to-wear-gold-helmets-for-home-games/c-281801034|website=National Hockey League|date=September 15, 2016|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}</ref>

In the 2017–18 season the Predators changed their uniform style to fit with the new [[Adidas]] template. While the gold home uniforms received minimal alterations, the away white uniforms featured more gold accents in the sleeves, shoulders and tail while navy was relegated to trim color.

The Predators unveiled a special edition uniform for the [[2020 NHL Winter Classic]], featuring a design inspired from the uniforms of the defunct [[Eastern Hockey League|EHL]] team [[Nashville Dixie Flyers]]. Heavy gold stripes with navy trim adorn the chest and sleeves while a script rendition of the team name was inserted to the gold chest stripe. A navy felt-rendered saber-toothed cat logo was also added on the left shoulder.

===Ownership===
The franchise was initially owned by a group led by [[Craig Leipold]]. On May 23, 2007, Leipold was reported to have reached a tentative agreement to sell the team to [[BlackBerry Limited|Research in Motion]] chairman and co-CEO [[Jim Balsillie]].<ref name=Balsille>[https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=208661&hubname= Balsillie attempting to buy Predators], The Sports Network, May 23, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016134421/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=208661&hubname= |date=October 16, 2007 }}</ref> At the time, Leipold indicated that the team would play the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 season]] in Nashville but that the future of the team after that was not clear.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Billionaire To Buy Predators|url=http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=6560713|website=newschannel5.com|publisher=WorldNow|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016131021/http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=6560713|archivedate=October 16, 2007|location=Nashville, TN|date=24 May 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On June 23, information was leaked by several sources indicating that Leipold no longer wanted to sell the Predators to Balsillie.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Damien|title=NHL calling the tune in Nashville|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/columnists/2007/06/23/nhl_calling_the_tune_in_nashville.html|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Toronto Star|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.|date=23 June 2007|location=Toronto, ON|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804173546/https://www.thestar.com/opinion/columnists/2007/06/23/nhl_calling_the_tune_in_nashville.html|archive-date=August 4, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Subsequently, a campaign to land the team in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], received a boost in late June 2007.<ref name="Predators get boost">Covitz, Randy.

On July 19, 2007, a group of local business owners known as Our Team Nashville held a rally at the [[Bridgestone Arena|Sommet Center]] to encourage fans to buy season tickets in order to help the Predators meet the attendance figures needed to keep the team in Nashville. They drew approximately 7,500 fans and sold the equivalent of 726 full season tickets during the rally.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Kevin|title=Local supporters stage successful ticket rally|url=http://predators.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=334837|website=National Hockey League|archivedate=August 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807134521/http://predators.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=334837|date=20 July 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The rally was heavily supported by [[George Plaster]], then a sportscaster on [[WGFX]] 104.5 "The Zone" sports radio in Nashville. On August 1, 2007, the group released a letter of intent from Craig Leipold.<ref>{{cite news|title=Predators set to sell team to local group|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2957518|accessdate=28 May 2017|publisher=ESPN|agency=Associated Press|date=2 August 2007}}</ref> After negotiations with the City of Nashville, the local group headed by David Freeman reached an agreement with [[List of mayors of Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville Mayor]] [[Karl Dean]], and the NHL Board of Governors approved the sale on November 29, 2007. The $172&nbsp;million acquisition of the Nashville Predators included repayment of existing debt of approximately $61&nbsp;million and $2.2&nbsp;million in fees and expenses. The sale of the Predators to the [[Tennessee]]-based group included Del Biaggio, who had been trying to move the team to Kansas City. The locally based buyers held 73% of the team, while Del Biaggio and a minority partner acquired about 27% of the club.

In June 2008, Del Biaggio ran into legal trouble over a multitude of unpaid loans, culminating in his filing for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]].<ref>[https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=569578 National Post story on Del Biaggio bankruptcy] {{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Furthermore, it was alleged that Del Biaggio acquired the loans he used to buy his stake in the team through fraudulent means, prompting an [[FBI]] investigation and criminal charges.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Maki|first1=Allan|title=Del Biaggio's trials take another twist|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/del-biaggios-trials-take-another-twist/article18451727/|accessdate=29 May 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|date=13 June 2008}}</ref> The charges culminated in a 97-month prison sentence for Del Biaggio.

====Ownership dispute====
On June 23, 2016, Freeman filed a $250&nbsp;million [[lawsuit]] against the Nashville Predators and Cigarran. His claim was that his ownership stake has been improperly diluted by Cigarran failing to notify him of [[capital call]]s, and that he had not received [[surety|loan guaranty]] fees that the ownership group had agreed to pay him.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rau|first1=Nate|title=Predators owner sues team, chairman for $250M|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/2016/06/23/predators-owner-files-suit-against-team-250m/86038666/|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=The Tennessean|date=June 23, 2016}}</ref> The lawsuit stated that Freeman initially owned a 48% share, while the holding company for the Nashville Predators stated that Freeman controlled less than 1% of ownership in the team at the time of the suit.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Steimer|first1=Jacob|title=Predators lawsuit sent back to arbitration, major win for team|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2016/07/29/predators-lawsuit-sent-back-to-arbitration-major.html|accessdate=May 7, 2017|work=Nashville Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=July 29, 2016}}</ref> This dilution was exacerbated by the existence of two classes of investments in the Predators: the common units owned by Freeman were subject to capital calls; the Series A units originally owned by Del Biaggio and his minority partner were not subject to capital calls.<ref>{{cite web|title=IN RE BIAGGIO {{!}} Case No. 08-30991 TEC, Adv.
