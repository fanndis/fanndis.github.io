==Early life==
Lucas was born Joshua Lucas Easy Dent Maurer on June 20, 1971, in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.arktimes.com/RockCandy/archives/2008/07/30/josh-lucas-stars-in-showtime-pilot |title=Josh Lucas stars in Showtime pilot |work=Arkansas Times |last=Millar |first=Lindsey |date=July 30, 2008 |accessdate=March 22, 2017}}</ref> the son of Michele (née LeFevre), a [[nurse midwife]], and Don Maurer, an [[Emergency physician|ER doctor]].

Lucas grew up traveling [[Southern United States|the South]] with his parents, who were antinuclear activists, and his three younger siblings. By the age of 13, he had lived in 30 different locations, including the [[Isle of Palms]] and [[Sullivan's Island]], South Carolina. His mother attended [[Emerson College]] with [[Jay Leno]]. The family eventually settled in [[Gig Harbor, Washington]]. He attended [[Kopachuck Middle School]] and graduated from [[Gig Harbor High School]] in 1989, where he acted in high school plays.

==Career==
Lucas began his career when he was 19, having moved to Hollywood after his high school graduation. He appeared as a guest star on several TV sitcoms in his early 20s, including Fox's ''[[True Colors (TV series)|True Colors]]'' and ''[[Parker Lewis Can't Lose]],'' the family drama ''[[Life Goes On (TV series)|Life Goes On]],'' and CBS's private-eye show ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Josh Lucas | url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800354375/bio | accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref>

Other projects included the horror-thriller ''Child of Darkness, Child of Light'', an adaptation of [[James Patterson]]'s novel ''Virgin'', a tale of two Catholic schoolgirls who find themselves pregnant under mysterious and supernatural circumstances. Lucas followed this appearance by working with executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] and then-unknown actor [[Clive Owen]] in the TV-movie ''[[Class of '61]]'', which follows the stories of a group of [[West Point]] cadets in 1861 as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] breaks out. Lucas played [[George Armstrong Custer]].

Soon afterward, he made his feature film debut in [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]]'s ''[[Alive (1993 film)|Alive]]'' about a group of [[Uruguay]]an rugby players who, after crashing in the [[Andes]] mountains, resort to [[cannibalism]] to stay alive. After a brief appearance in the [[Patrick Swayze]] comedy ''[[Father Hood]]'', Lucas relocated to Australia to play the hotheaded American cousin Luke McGregor opposite [[Andrew Clarke (actor)|Andrew Clarke]] and [[Guy Pearce]] in the first season of the family western ''[[Snowy River: The McGregor Saga]]''. Lucas appeared in all 13 episodes of the first season, but claimed in a later interview that despite the friendly environment, he was homesick for the United States, and his character was killed off in the second episode of season 2. Upon returning to the States, he was still receiving offers as high school/college boyfriends and felt he was not getting the age-appropriate roles he sought. While working with [[George C. Scott]] on a TV-movie from the ''[[In The Heat of the Night (TV series)|Heat of the Night]]'' series, Scott told him he needed to take acting lessons and develop his talent for both stage and screen. Shortly thereafter, he departed Hollywood and moved to New York City, where he studied privately with various acting coaches.

The second part of his career began with a lead role in the British rowing film [[True Blue (1996 film)|''True Blue'']] (released in the US as ''Miracle at Oxford''), in which he played a hotshot Navy rower who was recruited along with three other Americans to help Oxford win its annual boat race with Cambridge. He followed that with relatively small roles in the dramas ''Minotaur'' and ''Harvest''. He took his first stab at comedy in ''The Definite Maybe'', in which he played a recent college graduate who gets fired from his job and schemes with an old friend to purchase a house in the Hamptons.

He appeared as an American businessman in Jule Gilfillan's romantic comedy-drama ''Restless''. He also appeared in an [[off-Broadway]] production of [[Terrence McNally]]'s controversial ''[[Corpus Christi (play)|Corpus Christi]]'', a retelling of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], with the Jesus character (named Joshua) and his disciples all being gay. Lucas played the role of Judas as a gay predator. Right before the play was to open, Lucas was mugged and beaten on his way to the theater for dress rehearsal. He played the role of Judas with bloody bandages across his broken nose and black eyes. The audience thought the bandages were part of the play.<ref>Interview in ''New York Times Magazine'' March 2005 "A Gentleman Comes To Call"</ref> Following a series of operations to reset his nose, he began gathering larger roles in films like ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'', ''[[The Weight of Water (film)|The Weight of Water]]'', ''[[Session 9]]'', ''The Dancer'', ''[[When Strangers Appear]]'', and ''[[You Can Count on Me]]''.
