The '''High Court of New Zealand''' ({{lang-mi|Te Kōti Matua o Aotearoa}}) is the [[superior court]] of New Zealand. It has general jurisdiction and responsibility, under the Senior Courts Act 2016, as well as the High Court Rules 2016, for the [[administration of justice]] throughout [[New Zealand]]. There are 18 High Court locations throughout New Zealand, plus one stand-alone registry.

The High Court was established in 1841.<ref>[http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/sca18415v1841n1303/ ''Supreme Court Act 1841'' (NZ)]</ref> It was originally called the "Supreme Court of New Zealand", but the name was changed in 1980<ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1979/0124/latest/DLM35049.html Judicature Amendment Act 1979 (NZ), s 12].</ref> to make way for the naming of an eventual new [[Supreme Court of New Zealand]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/the-courts/high-court/history|title=History and role — Courts of New Zealand|website=www.courtsofnz.govt.nz|language=en-nz|access-date=2017-01-25}}</ref>

The High Court is a [[court of first instance]] for serious criminal cases such as homicide, civil claims exceeding $350,000 and certain other civil cases.  In its [[appellate court|appellate function]], the High Court hears appeals from the District Court, other lower courts and various tribunals.

==Composition and locations==
[[File:Wellington High Court 2015.JPG|thumb|left|Wellington High Court in 2015]]

The High Court comprises the [[Chief Justice of New Zealand|Chief Justice]] (who is head of the judiciary) and up to 55 other Judges (which includes the Justices of the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]] and the Justices of the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]]). The administrative head of the court is known as the Chief High Court Judge. [[Associate Judge]]s of the High Court (formerly known as Masters up until May 2004) supervise the Court's preliminary processes in most civil proceedings, and have jurisdiction to deal with summary judgment applications, company liquidations, bankruptcy proceedings, and some other types of civil proceedings.

The High Court Judges and Associate Judges are based in [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]], but also travel on circuit to [[Whangarei]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Rotorua]], [[Tauranga]], [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], [[New Plymouth]], [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], [[Whanganui]], [[Palmerston North]], [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]], [[Greymouth]], [[Timaru]], [[Dunedin]], and [[Invercargill]]. The Court also has a registry in [[Masterton]].

==Jurisdiction==
===Criminal matters ===
The High Court deals with the most serious types of criminal offences that exceed the District Court's jurisdiction. It deals with all category 4 offences, including murder, manslaughter and treason,<ref>Criminal Procedure Act 2011, section 74(3).</ref> as well as any other offence where the accused is likely to be sentenced to [[life imprisonment in New Zealand|life imprisonment]] or preventive detention. A High Court Judge may direct that a serious category 2 and 3 "protocol" offence, such as aggravated wounding with intent, kidnapping or sexual violation of a child, be transferred from the District Court to the High Court for hearing.<ref>Criminal Procedure Act 2011, sections 66 to 70.</ref> Most cases are heard before a Judge and jury, but may sometimes be heard before a Judge alone.

===Civil matters===
The Court has exclusive jurisdiction over all civil claims where the amount in dispute exceeds $350,000, and certain categories of proceedings.  The categories of proceeding which can only be commenced in the High Court includes matters concerning admiralty, certain applications relating to land (such as seeking its transfer or caveats), company law including liquidations, bankruptcy, the administration of estates and trusts, and trade mark and patent infringement. For civil claims worth less than $350,000, the High Court can have co-extensive jurisdiction with the District Court.

===Appellate function===
Rights of appeal to the High Court exist against the decisions of the District Court (except for jury trials), the Family Court, the Youth Court and the [[Environment Court]] and numerous administrative tribunals and regulatory bodies.

==Relationship with Australian courts==
The Trans-Tasman Proceedings Act 2010 (NZ), the Trans-Tasman Proceedings Act 2010 (Aust) and the High Court Rules 2016 streamline the process for resolving civil proceedings with a trans-Tasman element.  The Acts cover many matters including service, interim relief, hearing matters remotely and the enforcement of judgments of courts of the other country.
