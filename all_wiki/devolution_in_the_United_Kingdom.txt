In the [[United Kingdom]], '''devolution''' is the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] [[statutory]] granting of a greater level of [[self-determination|self-government]] to the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Parliament]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and the [[London Assembly]] and to their associated executive bodies the [[Scottish Government]], the [[Welsh Government]], the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] and in England, the [[Greater London Authority]] and [[combined authorities]].

[[Devolution]] differs from [[federalism]] in that the devolved powers of the subnational authority ultimately reside in central government, thus the state remains, ''[[de jure]]'', a [[unitary state]]. [[Legislation]] creating devolved [[parliament]]s or [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]] can be [[repeal]]ed or amended by central government in the same way as any statute.

==Irish home rule==
{{Main|Irish Home Rule movement|Irish issue in British politics}}

The issue of [[Irish home rule]] was the dominant political question of [[United Kingdom|British]] politics at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century.

Earlier in the 19th century, Irish politicians like [[Daniel O'Connell]] had demanded a [[(Irish) Repeal|repeal]] of the [[Act of Union 1800]] and a return to two separate kingdoms and parliaments, united only in the personal union of the monarch of Great Britain and Ireland. In contrast to this, demands for home rule called for autonomy for Ireland within the United Kingdom, with a subsidiary Irish parliament subject to the authority of the parliament at Westminster. This issue was first introduced by the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] led by [[Isaac Butt]], [[William Shaw (Irish politician)|William Shaw]] and [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].

Over the course of four decades, four [[Irish Home Rule Bill]]s were introduced into the British Parliament:
* the [[Irish Government Bill 1886|First Home Rule Bill]] was introduced in 1886 by Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. Following [[Ulster Unionism|intense opposition in Ulster]] and the departure of [[Liberal Unionist Party|Unionists]] from Gladstone's [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], the bill was defeated in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].
* the [[Irish Government Bill 1893|Second Home Rule Bill]] was introduced in 1893 by Prime Minister Gladstone and passed the Commons but was rejected in the [[House of Lords]].
* the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] was introduced in 1912 by Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] based on an agreement with the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. After a prolonged parliamentary struggle it was passed under the provisions of the [[Parliament Act 1911]], under which the Commons overruled the veto by the Lords. Again, this bill was fiercely opposed by [[Ulster Unionists]] who raised the [[Ulster Volunteers]] and signed the [[Ulster Covenant]] to oppose the bill, thereby raising the spectre of civil war. The act received royal assent (with restrictions in regard to Ulster) shortly after the outbreak of [[World War I]] but implementation was suspended until after the war's conclusion. Attempts at implementation failed in 1916 and 1917 and the subsequent [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1922) resulted in it never coming into force.
* The [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|Fourth Home Rule Bill]] was introduced in 1920 by Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] and passed both houses of parliament. It divided Ireland into [[Northern Ireland]] (six counties) and [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]] (twenty-six counties), which each had their own parliament and judiciary but which also shared some common institutions. The Act was implemented in Northern Ireland, where it served as the basis of government until its suspension in 1972 following the outbreak of [[the Troubles]]. The southern parliament convened only once and in 1922, under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], Southern Ireland became the [[Irish Free State]], a [[British dominion|dominion]] within the [[British Empire]], and was declared fully sovereign in 1937 (see [[Republic of Ireland]]).

==Northern Ireland==

Home Rule came into effect for [[Northern Ireland]] in 1921 under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|Fourth Home Rule Act]]. The [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] established under that act was prorogued (the session ended) on 30 March 1972 owing to the destabilisation of Northern Ireland upon the onset of [[the Troubles]] in late 1960s. This followed escalating violence by state and paramilitary organisations following the suppression of civil rights demands by Northern Ireland Catholics.

The [[Northern Ireland Parliament]] was abolished by the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]], which received royal assent on 19 July 1973. A [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1973)|Northern Ireland Assembly]] was elected on 28 June 1973 and following the [[Sunningdale Agreement]], a power-sharing [[Northern Ireland Executive (1974)|Northern Ireland Executive]] was formed on 1 January 1974.  This collapsed on 28 May 1974, due to the [[Ulster Workers' Council strike]]. The Troubles continued.

The [[Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention]] (1975–1976) and second [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1982)|Northern Ireland Assembly]] (1982–1986) were unsuccessful at restoring devolution.  In the absence of devolution and power-sharing, the [[UK Government]] and [[Irish Government]] formally agreed to co-operate on security, justice and political progress in the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], signed on 15 November 1985. More progress was made after the ceasefires by the [[Provisional IRA]] in 1994 and 1997.<ref>{{cite news|title=IRA Ceasefire |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/northern_ireland/understanding/events/ira_ceasefire.stm |work=The Search for Peace|publisher=BBC|year= 2005 |accessdate= 25 October 2011}}</ref>

The 1998 [[Belfast Agreement]] (also known as the Good Friday Agreement), resulted in the creation of a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], intended to bring together the two communities ([[Irish nationalist|nationalist]] and [[Irish unionist|unionist]]) to govern Northern Ireland.<ref name="Jackson 2003">Jackson, Alvin (2003) ''Home Rule, an Irish History 1800–2000'', {{ISBN |0-7538-1767-5}}.</ref> Additionally, renewed devolution in Northern Ireland was conditional on co-operation between the newly established [[Northern Ireland Executive]] and the [[Government of Ireland]] through a new all-Ireland body, the [[North/South Ministerial Council]].  A [[British-Irish Council]] covering the whole British Isles and a [[British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] (between the British and Irish Governments) were also established.

From 15 October 2002, the Northern Ireland Assembly was suspended due to a breakdown in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] but, on 13 October 2006, the British and Irish governments announced the [[St Andrews Agreement]], a 'road map' to restore devolution to Northern Ireland.<ref name= "BBC 2006">{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6046302.stm | title = March target date for devolution | newspaper = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 13 October 2006}}.</ref> On 26 March 2007, [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) leader [[Ian Paisley]] met [[Sinn Féin]] leader [[Gerry Adams]] for the first time and together announced that a devolved government would be returning to [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6494599.stm | title=NI deal struck in historic talks | publisher= BBC | date= 26 March 2007}}</ref> The Executive was restored on 8 May 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6634373.stm | title= Historic return for NI Assembly | publisher= BBC | date= 8 May 2007}}</ref> Several policing and justice powers were transferred to the Assembly on 12 April 2010.

==Scotland==
{{Main|History of Scottish devolution}}
[[File:British Isles Scotland.svg|thumb|120px|Map showing Scotland]]
[[File:Scottish Parliament, from Salisbury Crags.jpg|thumb|[[Scottish Parliament Building]], Edinburgh]]
Ever since the [[Parliament of Scotland]] adjourned in 1707 as a result of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], individuals and organisations had advocated the return of a Scottish Parliament. The drive for home rule first took concrete shape in the 19th century, as demands for it in Ireland were met with similar (although not as widespread) demands in Scotland. The [[National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights]] was established in 1853, a body close to the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Tories]] and motivated by a desire to secure more focus on Scottish problems in response to what they felt was undue attention being focused on Ireland by the then [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government. In 1871, [[William Ewart Gladstone]] stated at a meeting held in [[Aberdeen, Scotland|Aberdeen]] that if Ireland was to be granted home rule, then the same should apply to Scotland. A Scottish home rule bill was presented to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]] in 1913 but the legislative process was interrupted by the [[World War I|First World War]].

The demands for political change in the way in which Scotland was run changed dramatically in the 1920s when Scottish nationalists started to form various organisations. The [[Scots National League]] was formed in 1920 in favour of [[Scottish independence]], and this movement was superseded in 1928 by the formation of the [[National Party of Scotland]], which became the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) in 1934. At first the SNP sought only the establishment of a devolved Scottish assembly, but in 1942 they changed this to support all-out independence. This caused the resignation of [[John MacCormick]] from the SNP and he formed the [[Scottish Covenant Association]]. This body proved to be the biggest mover in favour of the formation of a Scottish assembly, collecting over two million signatures in the late 1940s and early 1950s and attracting support from across the political spectrum. However, without formal links to any of the political parties it withered, devolution and the establishment of an assembly were put on the political back burner.

[[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government set up a [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Royal Commission on the Constitution]] in 1969, which reported in 1973 to [[Ted Heath]]'s Conservative government. The Commission recommended the formation of a devolved Scottish assembly, but was not implemented.

Support for the SNP reached 30% in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] general election, with 11 SNP MPs being elected. In 1978 the Labour government passed the [[Scotland Act 1978|Scotland Act]] which legislated for the establishment of a Scottish Assembly, provided the Scots voted for such in a [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|referendum]]. However, the Labour Party was bitterly divided on the subject of devolution. An amendment to the Scotland Act that had been proposed by Labour MP [[George Cunningham (MP)|George Cunningham]], who shortly afterwards defected to the newly formed [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP), required 40% of the total electorate to vote in favour of an assembly. Despite officially favouring it, considerable numbers of Labour members opposed the establishment of an assembly. This division contributed to only a narrow 'Yes' majority being obtained, and the failure to reach Cunningham's 40% threshold. The 18 years of Conservative government, under [[Margaret Thatcher]] and then [[John Major]], saw strong resistance to any proposal for devolution for [[Scotland]], and for [[Wales]].

In response to Conservative dominance, in 1989 the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] was formed encompassing the Labour Party, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Green Party]], [[Regions and districts of Scotland|local authorities]], and sections of "civic Scotland" like [[Scottish Trades Union Congress]], the Small Business Federation and [[Church of Scotland]] and the other major churches in Scotland. Its purpose was to devise a scheme for the formation of a devolution settlement for Scotland. The SNP decided to withdraw as independence was not a constitutional option countenanced by the convention. The convention produced its final report in 1995.

In May 1997, the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[Tony Blair]] was elected with a promise of creating devolved institutions in Scotland. In late 1997, a [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|referendum]] was held which resulted in a "yes" vote. The newly created [[Scottish Parliament]] (as a result of the [[Scotland Act 1998]]) has powers to make primary [[legislation]] in all areas of policy which are not expressly 'reserved' for the UK Government and parliament such as national defence and international affairs.

Devolution for Scotland was justified on the basis that it would make government more representative of the people of Scotland. It was argued that the population of Scotland felt detached from the [[Her Majesty's Government|Westminster government]] (largely because of the policies of the [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative]] governments led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]]).

A [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on Scottish independence]] was held on 18 September 2014, with the referendum being defeated 55.3% (No) to 44.7% (Yes). In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election]] the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats with 50% of all Scottish votes. This saw the SNP replace the Liberal Democrats as the third largest in the UK Parliament.

In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election the SNP fell two seats short of an overall majority with 63 seats but remained in government for a third term. The Conservative Party won 31 seats and became the second largest party for the first time. The Labour Party, down to 24 seats from 38, fell to third place. The Scottish Greens took 6 seats and overtook the Liberal Democrats who remained flat at 5 seats.

Following the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum on EU membership]], where Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to Remain and [[England]] and [[Wales]] voted to Leave (leading to a [[Results of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|52% Leave vote nationwide]]), the Scottish Parliament voted for a [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second independence referendum]] to be held once conditions of the UK's EU exit are known. Conservative Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] rejected this request citing a need to focus on [[Brexit negotiations|EU exit negotiations]]. The SNP had advocated for another independence referendum to be held in 2020, but this was stopped by the Conservatives winning the majority of seats in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]]. They are widely expected to include a second independence referendum in their manifesto for the [[2021 Scottish Parliament election]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Watson|first=Jeremy|title=Independence vote will be key part of SNP manifesto|language=en|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/independence-vote-will-be-key-part-of-snp-manifesto-ljq03bzc5|access-date=2020-10-23|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> Senior SNP figures have said that a [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second independence referendum]] would be inevitable, should an SNP majority be elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2021 and some say this could happen by the end of 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|last=McCall|first=Chris|date=2020-10-22|title=Scottish independence referendum 'could happen in 2021' says senior SNP MSP|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/scottish-independence-referendum-could-happen-22887688|access-date=2020-10-23|website=Daily Record|language=en}}</ref>

==Wales==
{{main|Welsh Parliament|Welsh Government}}

[[File:British Isles Wales.svg|thumb|Map showing Wales]]
[[File:Welsh National Assembly Senedd.jpg|thumb|The [[Senedd building|Senedd]], home to the Welsh Parliament]]
After the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]], Wales was treated in legal terms as part of England. However, during the later part of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century the notion of a distinctive Welsh [[polity]] gained credence. In 1881 the [[Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881]] was passed, the first such legislation exclusively concerned with Wales. The Central Welsh Board was established in 1896 to inspect the grammar schools set up under the Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889, and a separate Welsh Department of the Board of Education was formed in 1907. The Agricultural Council for Wales was set up in 1912, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries had its own Welsh Office from 1919.

Despite the failure of popular political movements such as [[Cymru Fydd]], a number of national institutions, such as the [[National Eisteddfod]] (1861), the [[Football Association of Wales]] (1876), the [[Welsh national rugby union team|Welsh Rugby Union]] (1881), the [[University of Wales]] (Prifysgol Cymru) (1893), the [[National Library of Wales]] (Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru) (1911) and the [[Welsh Guards]] (Gwarchodlu Cymreig) (1915) were created. The campaign for disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Wales, achieved by the passage of the [[Welsh Church Act 1914]], was also significant in the development of Welsh political consciousness. [[Plaid Cymru]] was formed in 1925.

An appointed [[Council for Wales and Monmouthshire]] was established in 1949 to "ensure the government is adequately informed of the impact of government activities on the general life of the people of Wales". The council had 27 members nominated by local authorities in Wales, the [[University of Wales]], [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod Council]] and the [[Welsh Tourist Board]]. A cross-party Parliament for Wales campaign in the early 1950s was supported by a number of Labour MPs, mainly from the more Welsh-speaking areas, together with the Liberal Party and Plaid Cymru. A post of Minister of Welsh Affairs was created in 1951 and the post of [[Secretary of State for Wales]] and the [[Welsh Office]] were established in 1964 leading to the abolition of the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire.

Labour's incremental embrace of a distinctive Welsh polity was arguably catalysed in 1966 when Plaid Cymru president [[Gwynfor Evans]] won the [[1966 Carmarthen by-election|Carmarthen by-election]]. In response to the emergence of Plaid Cymru and the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour Government set up the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Royal Commission on the Constitution]] (the Kilbrandon Commission) to investigate the UK's constitutional arrangements in 1969. The 1974–1979 Labour government proposed a Welsh Assembly in parallel to its proposals for Scotland. These were rejected by voters in the [[1979 Welsh devolution referendum|1979 referendum]]: 956,330 votes against, 243,048 for.

In May 1997, the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[Tony Blair]] was elected with a promise of creating a devolved assembly in [[Wales]]; the [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum|referendum in 1997]] resulted in a narrow "yes" vote. The turnout was 50.22% with 559,419 votes (50.3%) in favour and 552,698 (49.7%) against, a majority of 6,721 (0.6%). The [[National Assembly for Wales]], as a consequence of the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]], possesses the power to determine how the [[government]] budget for Wales is spent and administered. The 1998 Act was followed by the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]] which created an executive body, the [[Welsh Government]], separate from the legislature, the National Assembly for Wales. It also conferred on the National Assembly some limited legislative powers.

The 1997 devolution referendum was only narrowly passed with the majority of voters in the former industrial areas of the [[South Wales Valleys]] and the Welsh-speaking heartlands of [[West Wales]] and [[North Wales]] voting for devolution and the majority of voters in all the counties near England, plus [[Cardiff]] and [[Pembrokeshire]] rejecting devolution. However, all recent opinion polls indicate an increasing level of support for further devolution, with support for some tax varying powers now commanding a majority, and diminishing support for the abolition of the Assembly.

The [[2011 Welsh devolution referendum]] saw a majority of 21 local authority constituencies to 1 voting in favour of more legislative powers being transferred from the UK parliament in Westminster to the Welsh Assembly. The turnout in Wales was 35.4% with 517,132 votes (63.49%) in favour and 297,380 (36.51%) against increased legislative power.

A [[Commission on Devolution in Wales]] was set up in October 2011 to consider further devolution of powers from London. The commission issued a report on the devolution of fiscal powers in November 2012 and a report on the devolution of legislative powers in March 2014. The fiscal recommendations formed the basis of the [[Wales Act 2014]], while the majority of the legislative recommendations were put into law by the [[Wales Act 2017]].

On 6 May 2020, the National Assembly was renamed ''Senedd Cymru'' or Welsh Parliament with ''Senedd'' as its common name in both languages.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Name Change Information|url=https://senedd.wales/en/abthome/Pages/Name-Change-Information.aspx|website=Welsh Parliament|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-07}}</ref>

[[File:English regions 2009.svg|thumb|Map of the informal [[regions of England]] as defined in 2009]]
England is the only country of the United Kingdom to not have a devolved Parliament or Assembly and English affairs are decided by the Westminster Parliament. Devolution for England was proposed in 1912 by the [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament for Dundee]], [[Winston Churchill]], as part of the debate on [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Home Rule for Ireland]]. In a speech in [[Dundee]] on 12 September, Churchill proposed that the government of England should be divided up among regional parliaments, with power devolved to areas such as Lancashire, Yorkshire, the Midlands and London as part of a federal system of government.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local Parliaments For England.

The division of England into provinces or regions was explored by several post-[[Second World War]] royal commissions. The [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] of 1969 proposed devolving power from central government to eight provinces in England. In 1973 the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)]] proposed the creation of eight English appointed regional assemblies with an advisory role; although the report stopped short of recommending legislative devolution to England, a minority of signatories wrote a memorandum of dissent which put forward proposals for devolving power to elected assemblies for Scotland, Wales and five Regional Assemblies in England.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=David M.|last2=Wistrich|first2=Enid|title=Devolution and localism in England|date=2014|isbn=9781472430793|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XV7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA6|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>

In April 1994 the [[Second Major ministry|Government of John Major]] created a set of ten [[Government Office|Government Office Regions]] for England to coordinate central government departments at a provincial level.<ref name=audretsch>{{cite book|editor1-last=Audretsch|editor1-first=David B.|editor2-last=Bonser|editor2-first=Charles F.|title=Globalization and regionalization : challenges for public policy|date=2002|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Boston|isbn=9780792375524|pages=25–28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TNAi1XcdY8C&pg=PA25|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> [[regional development agency|English Regional Development Agencies]] were set up in 1998 under the [[First Blair ministry|Government of Tony Blair]] to foster economic growth around England.

These bodies were not directly elected but members were appointed by local government and local interest groups.

English Regional Assemblies were abolished between 2008 and 2010, but proposals to replace them were put forward.

There have been proposals for the establishment of a single [[devolved English Parliament]] to govern the affairs of England as a whole. This has been supported by groups such as English Commonwealth, the [[English Democrats]] and [[Campaign for an English Parliament]], as well as the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] who have both expressed support for greater autonomy for all four nations while ultimately striving for a dissolution of the Union. Without its own devolved Parliament, England continues to be governed and legislated for by the UK Government and UK Parliament which gives rise to the [[West Lothian question]]. The question concerns the fact that, on devolved matters, Scottish MPs continue to help make laws that apply to England alone, although no English MPs can make laws on those same matters for Scotland. Since the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] there has been a wider debate about the UK adopting a [[Federalism in the United Kingdom|federal system]] with each of the four [[home nations]] having its own, equal devolved legislatures and law-making powers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Shirley|authorlink1=Shirley Williams|title=How Scotland could lead the way towards a federal UK|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/16/scotland-scottish-indpendence-referendum-federal-uk-england-wales|accessdate=20 September 2014|work=The Guardian|date=16 September 2014}}</ref>

==Crown dependencies==
[[File:British Isles Channel Islands.svg|thumb|120px|Map showing the Channel Islands]]
[[File:British Isles Isle of Man.svg|thumb|120px|Map showing the Isle of Man]]
The legislatures of the [[Crown dependencies]] are not devolved as their origins predate the establishment of the United Kingdom and their attachment to the [[British Crown]], and the Crown Dependencies are not part of the United Kingdom. However, the United Kingdom has redefined its formal relationship with the Crown Dependencies since the late 20th century.

Crown dependencies are possessions of the British Crown, as opposed to [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territories]] or [[colonies]] of the United Kingdom. They comprise the [[Channel Island]] [[bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]], and the [[Isle of Man]] in the Irish Sea.<ref>{{cite web | title = ''Crown Dependencies'', 8th Report of 2009–10, HC 56-1 | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/5602.htm | publisher = [[Justice Select Committee|House of Commons Justice Select Committee]] | date = 23 March 2010 }}</ref>

For several hundred years, each has had its own separate legislature, government and judicial system. However, as possessions of the Crown they are not sovereign nations in their own right and the British Government is responsible for the overall good governance of the islands and represents the islands in international law. Acts of the UK Parliament are normally only extended to the islands only with their specific consent.<ref>In relation to Jersey, see {{cite web | title = Jersey law course | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104105/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 | archive-date = 28 December 2013 | url = http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 | publisher = Institute of Law Jersey }}</ref> Each of the islands is represented on the [[British-Irish Council]].

The [[Lord Chancellor]], a post in the UK Government, is responsible for relations between the government and the Channel Islands. All insular legislation must be approved by the [[Queen in Council]] and the [[Lord Chancellor]] is responsible for proposing the legislation on the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. He can refuse to propose insular legislation or can propose it for the Queen's approval.

In 2007–2008, each Crown Dependency and the UK signed agreements<ref name="gov.je">
:{{cite book | title = Framework for developing the international identity of Jersey | url = http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20InternationalIdentityFramework%2020070502.pdf | publisher = [[States of Jersey]] }}

:{{cite book | title = Framework for developing the international identity of the Isle of Man | url = http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/cso/iominternationalidentityframework.pdf | publisher = [[Isle of Man Government]] }}</ref> that established frameworks for the development of the international identity of each Crown Dependency. Among the points clarified in the agreements were that:
* the UK has no democratic accountability in and for the Crown Dependencies which are governed by their own democratically elected assemblies;
* the UK will not act internationally on behalf of the Crown Dependencies without prior consultation;
* each Crown Dependency has an international identity that is different from that of the UK;
* the UK supports the principle of each Crown Dependency further developing its international identity;
* the UK recognises that the interests of each Crown Dependency may differ from those of the UK, and the UK will seek to represent any differing interests when acting in an international capacity; and
* the UK and each Crown Dependency will work together to resolve or clarify any differences that may arise between their respective interests.

Jersey has moved further than the other two Crown dependencies in asserting its autonomy from the United Kingdom. The preamble to the States of Jersey Law 2005 declares that 'it is recognized that Jersey has autonomous capacity in domestic affairs' and 'it is further recognized that there is an increasing need for Jersey to participate in matters of international affairs'.<ref>{{cite book | title = States of Jersey Law 2005 | url = http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/States%20Assembly/States%20of%20Jersey%20Law%202005.pdf | publisher = [[States of Jersey]] | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120523212319/http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/States%20Assembly/States%20of%20Jersey%20Law%202005.pdf | archivedate = 23 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> In July 2005, the Policy and Resources Committee of the [[States of Jersey]] established the Constitutional Review Group, chaired by Sir [[Philip Bailhache]], with terms of reference 'to conduct a review and evaluation of the potential advantages and disadvantages for Jersey in seeking independence from the United Kingdom or other incremental change in the constitutional relationship, while retaining the Queen as Head of State'.

This document noted that Jersey "is a self-governing, democratic country with the power of self-determination" and "that it is not Government policy to seek independence from the United Kingdom, but rather to ensure that Jersey is prepared if it were in the best interests of Islanders to do so". On the basis of the established principles the Council of Ministers decided to "ensure that Jersey is prepared for external change that may affect the Island’s formal relationship with the United Kingdom and/or European Union".

The table shows the areas and degree of autonomy and budgetary independence. Exclusive means that the devolved administration has exclusive powers in this policy area. Shared means that some areas of policy in the specific area are not under the control of the devolved administration. For example, while policing and criminal law may be a competence of the Scottish Government, the UK Government remains responsible for anti-terrorism and coordinates serious crime through the [[National Crime Agency#Jurisdiction|NCA]].
