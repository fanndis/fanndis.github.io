{{short description|Honorary doctorate}}
The degree of '''Doctor of Humane Letters''' ({{Lang-la|Litterarum humanarum doctor}}; '''DHL'''; or '''LHD''') is almost always conferred as an [[honorary degree]], usually to those who have distinguished themselves in areas other than science, government, literature or religion, which are awarded degrees of [[Doctor of Science]], [[Doctor of Law]], [[Doctor of Letters]], or [[Doctor of Divinity]], respectively.

Doctor of Humane Letters degrees should not be confused with earned academic degrees awarded on the basis of research, such as [[Doctor of Philosophy]], [[Doctor of Science]] or [[Doctor of Theology]], nor earned professional doctorates such as [[Doctor of Medicine]], [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine]], [[Juris Doctor]], [[Doctor of Optometry]]  etc.<ref>"Doctor of Humane Letters."
