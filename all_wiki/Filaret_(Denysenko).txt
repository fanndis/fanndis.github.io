'''Patriarch Filaret''' ([[secular name]] ''Mykhailo Antonovych Denysenko'', born 23 January 1929) is the primate and Patriarch of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate]] (1995–2018; 2019–present). He was the honorary Patriarch of the [[Orthodox Church of Ukraine]] (2018–2019), and the former [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Kyiv#Metropolitans of Kyiv and All Ukraine (1990–present)|Metropolitan of Kyiv]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (1966–1992). He was [[defrocked]] and in 1997 [[ex-communication|excommunicated]] by the ROC.

==Early years==
Mykhailo Denysenko was born on 23 January 1929,<ref name=":7" /> into a worker's family of Anton and Melania Denysenko in the village of Blahodatne in the [[Amvrosiivsky Raion]] ([[raion|district]]) today in the [[Donetsk Oblast]] ([[Oblast|province]]) in [[Eastern Ukraine]].<ref name="finallyaref">{{cite web|url=https://ukrainianweek.com/Society/64554|title=Filaret: A Statehood-oriented Patriarch|last=Losiev|first=Ihor|date=8 November 2012|website=[[The Ukrainian Week]]|access-date=6 January 2019}}</ref> He obtained his [[theological]] education at the [[Odessa]] Seminary (Moscow Patriarchate) and the [[Moscow Theological Academy and Seminary|Moscow Theological Academy]] where he became a close associate of [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Patriarch Alexius I]] of Moscow. He took [[monastic vows]] in 1950 assuming the monastic name ''Filaret'' and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] [[hierodeacon]] in January 1950 and [[priest]] in June 1951.<ref name=finallyaref/> After his graduation he stayed at the Moscow Theological Academy as a professor (from 1952) and Senior Assistant to the Academy inspector.<ref name=finallyaref/> In 1956 he was appointed Inspector of the Theological Seminary in [[Saratov]] and elevated to the rank of [[hegumen]]. In 1957 he was appointed Inspector of the [[Kyiv]] Theological Seminary.<ref name=finallyaref/> In July 1958 he was further elevated to the rank of [[Archimandrite]] and appointed seminary [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]].<ref name=finallyaref/>

==Hierarch of the Russian Orthodox Church==
In 1961, Filaret served in the mission of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) to the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]]. In January 1962 Filaret was elected [[vicar]] Bishop of the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] [[Eparchy]] and, in February, was ordained [[bishop]] in Leningrad by [[Patriarch Pimen I|Metropolitan Pimen]] (later [[Moscow Patriarch]]) and other bishops. Filaret was appointed to several diplomatic missions of the Russian Orthodox Church and from 1962 to 1964 served as ROC Bishop of [[Vienna]] and [[Austria]].<ref name=finallyaref/> In 1964 he returned to [[Moscow]] as the Bishop of [[Dmitrov]] and rector of the Moscow Theological Academy and Seminary.

In 1966, he became [[archbishop]] of [[Kyiv]] and [[Halych]], thus becoming one of the most influential [[hierarch]]s in the Russian Orthodox Church, where the office of the Kyiv Metropolitan is highly regarded. At that time he also became a permanent member of the [[Holy Synod#The Russian Holy Synod|Holy Synod]], the highest collegiate body of the Russian Orthodox Church, which has the responsibility of electing the [[Moscow Patriarch]]. In 1968 Filaret became Metropolitan of Kyiv and Galicia.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Losiev|first1=Ihor|title=Filaret: A Statehood-oriented Patriarch|url=http://ukrainianweek.com/Society/64554|newspaper=The Ukrainian Week|edition=International|publisher=Ukrainian Week LLC|date=2012-11-08|accessdate=2016-11-22|quote=Held several top offices in the Russian Orthodox Church in 1960-1990, including Exarch of Central Europe, Bishop of Vienna and Austria, Rector of the Moscow Ecclesiastical Academy and Seminary, Exarch of Ukraine, Metropolitan of Kyiv and Galicia (since 1968)}}</ref>

As late as October 1989, Filaret was still saying, "The [[Uniates]] will never be legalized in our country."<ref>Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, ''The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB'', (1999). Page 503.</ref>

On May 3, 1990, [[Patriarch Pimen I of Moscow|Patriarch Pimen of Moscow]] died and, the same day, Filaret became the [[Locum|locum tenens]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

On 27 October 1990, in a ceremony at [[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kyiv |St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv]], the newly elected [[Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow|Patriarch Alexei II]] handed to Metropolitan Filaret a ''[[Tomos (Eastern Orthodox Church)|tomos]]'' granting "independence in self government" (the tomos did not use either of the words [[Autonomy (Eastern Christianity)|"autonomy"]] or "[[autocephaly]]") to Metropolitan Filaret, and enthroned Filaret, heretofore "Metropolitan of Kyiv", as "Metropolitan of Kyiv and All-Ukraine".<ref name=finallyaref/>

In 1992, the Russian Orthodox priest and [[Soviet dissident]] Fr. [[Gleb Yakunin]] accused Exarch Filaret of having been an informer for the [[KGB]]. Father Gleb stated that he had seen KGB files which listed Exarch Filaret's codename as ''Antonov''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1992/0428/28191.html|title=The KGB's Agents in Cassocks|last=Uzzell|first=Lawrence A.|date=1992-04-28|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|access-date=2019-11-13|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20191113081601/https://www.csmonitor.com/1992/0428/28191.html|archive-date=2019-11-13|issn=0882-7729}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1992-05-07-1992128134-story.html|title=Covering Up the Kremlin's Agents in Cassocks|last=UZZELL|first=LAWRENCE A.|date=1992-05-07|website=baltimoresun.com|publisher=[[Baltimore Sun]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20191113082419/https://www.tribpub.com/gdpr/baltimoresun.com/|archive-date=2019-11-13|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> According to internal KGB documents, tasks the KGB assigned Filaret as an agent included promoting Soviet positions and candidates in the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Christian Peace Conference (CPC) and other international bodies, and, by the 1980s, backing the Soviet authorities’ attempts to prevent the long-suppressed Ukrainian Catholic Church (disparagingly called ‘Uniates’) from regaining an open existence, and backing state attempts to prevent religious believers demanding their rights as glasnost and perestroika opened up the sphere of public debate.<ref>The Antonov Files: Patriarch Filaret and the KGB https://www.academia.edu/37256947/The_Antonov_Files_Patriarch_Filaret_and_the_KGB</ref> In 2018, Filaret declared in an interview with [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty]] that he, like all bishops under [[Warsaw Pact|communism]], had to have contacts with the KGB.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2018/12/23/7202101/|title=Філарет розповів про вплив КДБ на церкву часів СРСР і погрози розстрілом|date=23 December 2018|website=www.pravda.com.ua|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spzh.news/ru/news/58610-filaret-rasskazal-o-svojem-sotrudnichestve-s-kgb|title=Филарет рассказал о своем сотрудничестве с КГБ|date=23 December 2018|website=spzh.news|language=RU|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/29671187.html|script-title=uk:"Виймає пістолет і каже: ми можемо вас розстріляти" – Філарет розповів про співпрацю церкви і КДБ|date=23 December 2018|website=Радіо Свобода|language=uk|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Citation|last=Радіо Свобода|title=Якби я не поступився, томосу не було б – Філарет|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xLkhcCl-tA|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref> In 2019, he declared every bishop of the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Moscow Patriarchate]] had to have contact with the KGB, even when it came to appoint a bishop.

==Creation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate ==
{{Main|Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate}}
Following Ukraine's declaration of independence from the [[Soviet Union]] on 24 August 1991, a national [[Synod#Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox|sobor]] of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church was held from November 1–3.<ref name=finallyaref/> At the sobor, the voting delegates, (who included all UOC bishops, clergy and lay delegates from each diocese; a delegate from each monastery and seminary, and recognized lay brotherhood) unanimously passed a resolution stating that henceforth the UOC would operate as an autocephalous church.<ref name=finallyaref/> A separate resolution, also unanimous, affirmed the church's desire for Metropolitan Filaret to become its Primate.

Filaret convened an assembly at the [[Kyiv Pechersk Lavra]] in January 1992 that adopted a request of autocephaly for Ukrainians to the Moscow Patriarch.<ref>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/221781 After autocephaly], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (26 October 2018)<br>{{in lang|uk}} [https://m.gazeta.ua/articles/life/_vselenskij-patriarhat-oprilyudniv-dokumenti-na-pidtrimku-ukrayinskoyi-avtokefaliyi/859088 The Ecumenical Patriarchate unveiled documents in support of Ukrainian autocephaly], [[Gazeta.ua]] (14 September 2018)</ref>

In March–April 1992, the Hierarchical Council of the Russian Orthodox Church met with a single agenda item: to consider the resolution passed by the UOC Sobor four months earlier. Although the issue itself was not discussed, Filaret was asked to resign.<ref name=finallyaref/> On the second day of the meeting, Metropolitan Filaret agreed to submit his resignation to the UOC Synod, and the ROC Synod passed a resolution which stated:

''"The Council of Bishops took into account the statement of the Most Reverend Filaret, Metropolitan of Kyiv and of All-Ukraine, that for the sake of church peace, at the next Council of Bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, he will submit a request to be relieved from the position of the Primate of the UOC. Understanding of the position of Metropolitan Filaret, the Council of Bishops expressed to him its gratitude for the long period of labour as Archbishop of the See of Kyiv and blessed him to carry out his episcopal service in another diocese of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church."''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/526289.html|title=Определение относительно обращения епископата Украинской Православной Церкви по поводу дарования ей автокефалии / Официальные документы / Патриархия.ru|website=Патриархия.ru|language=ru|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

However, after returning to Kyiv, Filaret recanted his resignation. On 14 April, Metropolitan Filaret held a press conference in which he alleged that undue pressure was exerted at the ROC Synod in Moscow, both directly and through threats made by [[Federal Counterintelligence Service|FSK]] personnel who, he said, were present at the gathering. Filaret stated that he was retracting his resignation on the grounds that his resignation "would not bring peace to the Church, would contradict the will of the believers, and would be uncanonical."{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== Suspension and anathemization ==
Shortly thereafter, the Russian Orthodox Church, unable to prevent the creation of what it viewed as a "[[schism (religion)|schism]]atic church" in independent Ukraine, helped to organize a rival [[synod]] which was held in [[Kharkiv]] in May 1992. These bishops elected a bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church, [[Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan)|Bishop Volodymyr (Sabodan)]], Metropolitan of Kyiv, and received recognition from Moscow as the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]].<ref name=":1" />

=== Conflict ===
{{Main articles|Conflict between Filaret and Epiphanius}}
A conflict erupted between Filaret and [[Epiphanius I of Ukraine|Epiphanius]] because of disagreements concerning the model of governance, the management of the diaspora, the name and the statute of the OCU.

According to Filaret, the agreement reached at the unification council was as follows: "the [[Epiphanius I of Ukraine|primate]] is responsible for the external representation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), and the patriarch is responsible for the internal church life in Ukraine, but in cooperation with the primate. The primate shall do nothing in the church without the consent of the patriarch. The patriarch chairs the meetings of the Holy Synod and the UOC meetings for the sake of preserving unity, its growth, and affirmation." Filaret considers this agreement has not been fulfilled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unian.info/society/10549452-patriarch-filaret-talks-of-split-schools-metropolitan-epifaniy.html|title=Patriarch Filaret talks of split, schools Metropolitan Epifaniy|date=15 May 2019|website=www.unian.info|language=en|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://risu.org.ua/ua/index/all_news/orthodox/ocu/75797/|title=Відмова від статусу Патріархату була чисто ситуативною, - почесний Патріарх Філарет виступив із заявою|date=15 May 2019|website=risu.org.ua|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref>

In an interview released in March 2020 to the Ukraine Channel 4, he declared that the Holy Eucharist could be administrated from one spoon, because it's impossible to get viruses from the gloriously resurrected Body of Jesus Christ God.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-church-leader-who-called-coronavirus-punishment-for-evil-of-same-sex-marriage-has-covid-19/ | title = Church leader who called coronavirus punishment for "evil" of same-sex marriage has COVID-19 | date = September 9, 2020 | publisher = [[CBS News]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200910042930/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-church-leader-who-called-coronavirus-punishment-for-evil-of-same-sex-marriage-has-covid-19/ | archive-date = September 10, 2020 | url-status = live}}</ref>
The statement is based on the belief in the [[impassibility of God]] the Father and of the corresponding impassibility of God the Son before his [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the regain of the same impassibility at the time of the Resurrection three days after the death on the cross and the previous [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]].
