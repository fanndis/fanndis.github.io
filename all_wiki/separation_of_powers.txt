{{forms of government}}
The '''separation of powers''' is an approach to [[governance|governing]] a [[state (polity)|state]]. Under it, a state's government is divided into branches, each with separate, independent powers and responsibilities so that the [[power (social and political)|powers]] of one branch are not in conflict with those of the other branches. The typical division is into three branches: a [[legislature]], an [[Executive (government)|executive]], and a [[judiciary]], which is the ''{{Lang|la|trias politica}}'' model. It can be contrasted with the [[fusion of powers]] in [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and [[semi-presidential systems]], where the executive and legislative branches overlap.

The intention behind a system of separated powers is to prevent the concentration of power by providing for [[#Checks and balances|checks and balances]].

The separation of powers model is often imprecisely and [[metonymy|metonymically]] used interchangeably with the ''{{Lang|la|trias politica}}'' principle. While the {{Lang|la|trias politica}} model is a common type of separation, there are governments that have greater or fewer than three branches, as mentioned later in the article.

== History ==
{{Republicanism sidebar}}

=== Antiquity ===
[[Aristotle]] first mentioned the idea of a "mixed government" or hybrid government in his work [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], where he drew upon many of the constitutional forms in the [[Polis|city-states of Ancient Greece]]. In the [[Roman Republic]], the [[Roman Senate]], [[Roman consul|Consuls]] and the [[Roman assemblies|Assemblies]] showed an example of a [[mixed government]] according to [[Polybius]] (''Histories'', Book 6, 11–13).

=== Early modern mixed government ===
[[John Calvin]] (1509–1564) favoured a system of government that divided political power between [[democracy]] and [[aristocracy]] ([[mixed government]]). Calvin appreciated the advantages of [[democracy]], stating: "It is an invaluable gift if God allows a people to elect its own government and magistrates."<ref>Quoted in Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', Third Edition (1960), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210</ref> In order to reduce the danger of misuse of political power, Calvin suggested setting up several political institutions that should complement and control each other in a system of [[#Checks and balances|checks and balances]].<ref>

In this way, Calvin and his followers resisted [[autocracy|political absolutism]] and furthered the growth of democracy. Calvin aimed to protect the rights and the well-being of ordinary people.<ref>Clifton E.

Enjoying self-rule, they established a bipartite democratic system of government.

===Tripartite System===

During the [[English Civil War]], the parliamentarians viewed the English system of government as composed of three branches - the King, the [[House of Lords]] and the [[House of Commons]] - where the first should have executive powers only, and the latter two legislative powers. One of the first documents proposing a tripartite system of separation of powers was the [[Instrument of Government]], written by the English general [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]] in 1653, and soon adopted as the constitution of England for few years during [[The Protectorate]]. The system comprised a legislative branch (the Parliament) and two executive branches, the [[English Council of State]] and the [[Lord Protector]], all being elected (though the Lord Protector was elected for life) and having checks upon each other.<ref>Vile, M. J. (1967). The separation of powers. In: Greene, J. P., & Pole, J. R. (Eds.). (2008). ''A companion to the American Revolution'', Ch. 87. John Wiley & Sons..</ref>

A further development in English thought was the idea that the judicial powers should be separated from the executive branch. This followed the use of the juridical system by the Crown to prosecute opposition leaders following [[The English Restoration|the Restoration]], in the late years of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and during the short reign of [[James II of England|James II]] (namely, during the 1680s).<ref>Marshall J.

=== Montesquieu's separation of powers system ===
[[File:Montesquieu 1.png|thumb|[[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]]]]
The term "tripartite system" is commonly ascribed to [[France|French]] [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[political philosopher]] [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]], although he did not use such a term but referred to "distribution" of powers. In ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748),<ref name="Espritdeslois3">{{Cite web|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Esprit_des_lois_(1777)/L11/C6|title=Esprit des lois (1777)/L11/C6 - Wikisource|website=fr.wikisource.org|language=fr|access-date=2018-03-11}}</ref> Montesquieu described the various forms of distribution of [[political power]] among a [[legislature]], an [[executive (government)|executive]], and a [[judiciary]]. Montesquieu's approach was to present and defend a form of government whose powers were not excessively centralized in a single monarch or similar ruler (a form known then as "aristocracy"). He based this model on the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic]] and the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional system]]. Montesquieu took the view that the Roman Republic had powers separated so that no one could usurp complete power.<ref>{{citation|title=The Roman Republic in Montesquieu and Rousseau – Abstract|last=Price|first=Sara|ssrn=1766947|date=22 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.rschindler.com/montesquieu.htm|title=Montesquieu's Political Writings|last=Schindler|first=Ronald|accessdate=19 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012023735/http://www.rschindler.com/montesquieu.htm|archivedate=12 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Polybius and the Founding Fathers: the separation of powers|last=Lloyd|first=Marshall Davies|date=22 September 1998|url=http://mlloyd.org/mdl-indx/polybius/intro.htm|accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref> In the British constitutional system, Montesquieu discerned a separation of powers among the monarch, Parliament, and the courts of law.<ref>Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu, ''The Spirit of Laws'', trans. by Thomas Nugent, revised ed.

{{Quote|
In every government there are three sorts of power: the legislative; the executive in respect to things dependent on the law of nations; and the executive in regard to matters that depend on the civil law.

By virtue of the first, the prince or magistrate enacts temporary or perpetual laws, and amends or abrogates those that have been already enacted. By the second, he makes peace or war, sends or receives embassies, establishes the public security, and provides against invasions. By the third, he punishes criminals, or determines the disputes that arise between individuals. The latter we shall call the judiciary power, and the other simply the executive power of the state.
||source=}}

Montesquieu argues that each Power should only exercise its own functions. He was quite explicit here:<ref>Montesquieu, ''The Spirit of Laws'', at pp. 151–52.</ref>

{{Quote|
When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.

Again, there is no liberty, if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and oppression.

There would be an end of everything, were the same man or the same body, whether of the nobles or of the people, to exercise those three powers, that of enacting laws, that of executing the public resolutions, and of trying the causes of individuals. ||source=}}

Separation of powers requires a different source of legitimization, or a different act of legitimization from the same source, for each of the separate powers. If the legislative branch appoints the executive and judicial powers, as Montesquieu indicated, there will be no separation or division of its powers, since the power to appoint carries with it the power to revoke.<ref>Montesquieu, ''The Spirit of Laws'', at p. 156.</ref>

{{Quote|
The executive power ought to be in the hands of a monarch, because this branch of government, having need of despatch, is better administered by one than by many: on the other hand, whatever depends on the legislative power is oftentimes better regulated by many than by a single person.

But if there were no monarch, and the executive power should be committed to a certain number of persons selected from the legislative body, there would be an end then of liberty; by reason the two powers would be united, as the same persons would sometimes possess, and would be always able to possess, a share in both.

||source=}}

Montesquieu actually specified that the independence of the judiciary has to be real, and not merely apparent.<ref name="Przeworski 26">Stephen Holmes, "Lineages of the Rule of Law", in Adam Przeworski & José María Maravall, eds., ''Democracy & the Rule of Law'', Cambridge Studies in the Theory of Democracy Series, № 5 (Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 19–61 at 26, {{ISBN|0-521-53266-3|}}.</ref> The judiciary was generally seen as the most important of the three powers, independent and unchecked.<ref name="Przeworski 13">Przeworski 2003, p.13</ref>

=== Checks and balances ===
{{redirect|Checks and balances|the conservative-libertarian organization|Checks and Balances (organization)}}
{{See also|Divide and rule}}

The principle of checks and balances is that each branch has power to limit or check the other two, which creates a balance between the three separate branches of the state. This principle induces one branch to prevent either of the other branches from becoming supreme, thereby securing [[political liberty]].

[[Immanuel Kant]] was an advocate of this, noting that "the problem of setting up a state can be solved even by a nation of devils" so long as they possess an appropriate constitution to pit opposing factions against each other.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|editor-last=Reiss|editor-first=Hans|title=Political Writings|chapter=Perpetual Peace|location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge U.P. |year = 1971 |pages=112–13 |chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=v7v3CwAAQBAJ&pg=PT79}}</ref>
Checks and balances are designed to maintain the system of separation of powers keeping each branch in its place.  The idea is that it is not enough to separate the powers and guarantee their independence but the branches need to have the constitutional means to defend their own legitimate powers from the encroachments of the other branches.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed48.asp |title = The Avalon Project : Federalist No 48 |website=avalon.law.yale.edu |access-date=2018-03-28 }}</ref> They guarantee that the branches have the same level of power (co-equal), that is, are balanced, so that they can limit each other, avoiding the abuse of power. The origin of checks and balances, like separation of powers itself, is specifically credited to [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] in the Enlightenment (in [[The Spirit of the Laws]], 1748). Under this influence it was implemented in 1787 in the [[Constitution of the United States]].

The following example of the separation of powers and their mutual checks and balances from the experience of the [[United States Constitution]] is presented as illustrative of the general principles applied in [[presidential system|similar forms of government]] as well:<ref name="federalistNo51">{{cite web |url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed51.asp |title = The Avalon Project : Federalist No 51 |last=James|first=Madison|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=2018-03-24}}</ref>

{{Quote|
But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.

A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions. This policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as well as public. We see it particularly displayed in all the subordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other that the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights. These inventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the distribution of the supreme powers of the State.

== Comparison between tripartite and bipartite national systems ==
[[Constitution]]s with a high degree of separation of powers are found worldwide. A number of [[Latin America]]n countries have [[electoral branch]]es of government.

The [[Westminster system]] is distinguished by a particular entwining of powers,<ref>See [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-accused-of-waging-war-on-parliament-by-forcing-through-key-legal-changes-without-debate-a6820176.html ''Government accused of 'waging war' on Parliament by forcing through key law changes without debate''], Independent, 19 January 2016.</ref> such as in [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Politics of Canada|Canada]]. Canada makes limited use of separation of powers in practice, although in theory it distinguishes between branches of government. New Zealand's [[Constitution of New Zealand|constitution]] is based on the principle of separation of powers through a series of constitutional safeguards, many of which are tacit. The Executive's ability to carry out decisions often depends on the Legislature, which is elected under the [[mixed-member proportional representation|mixed member proportional]] system. This means the government is rarely a single party but a coalition of parties. The Judiciary is also free of government interference. If a series of judicial decisions result in an interpretation of the law which the Executive considers does not reflect the intention of the policy, the Executive can initiate changes to the legislation in question through the Legislature. The Executive cannot direct or request a judicial officer to revise or reconsider a decision; decisions are final. Should there be a dispute between the Executive and Judiciary, the Executive has no authority to direct the Judiciary, or its individual members and vice versa.

Complete separation of powers systems are almost always [[Presidential system|presidential]], although theoretically this need not be the case. There are a few historical exceptions, such as the [[French Directory|Directoire]] system of revolutionary France. [[Swiss politics|Switzerland]] offers an example of non-Presidential separation of powers today: It is run by a seven-member executive branch, the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]]. However, some might argue{{Weasel inline|date=September 2017}} that Switzerland does not have a strong separation of powers system as the Federal Council is appointed by parliament (but not dependent on parliament) and, although the judiciary has no power of review, the judiciary is still separate from the other branches.

=== Typical branches ===
* [[Executive (government)|executive]]
* [[legislature|legislative]]
* [[judiciary|judicial]]

==== Additional branches ====
*[[Supreme audit institution|auditory]]
* [[election commission|electoral]] – in which election commissions, tribunals or courts are maintained separately from other branches
* [[Attorney general|prosecutory]]
* [[civil service commission]]

=== Three branches ===
==== Australia ====
{{Main|Separation of powers in Australia}}

[[Australia]] does not maintain a strict separation between the legislative and executive branches of government—indeed, government ministers are required to be members of parliament—but the federal judiciary strictly guards its independence from the other two branches. However, under influence from the U.S. constitution, the Australian constitution does define the three branches of government separately, which has been interpreted by the judiciary to induce an implicit separation of powers.<ref>See ''Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth'' [1951] HCA 5, [http://%5Bhttp://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/5.html?stem=0&synonyms=0&query=communist%20party%20v%20commonwealth AustLII]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> State governments have a similar level of separation of power but this is generally on the basis of convention, rather than constitution.

==== Austria ====
{{context|section|date=November 2018}}
{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
The [[Constitution of Austria]] was originally written by [[Hans Kelsen]], a prominent constitutional scholar in Europe at that time. Kelsen was to serve as a part of the judicial court of review for Austria as part of its tripartite government.

==== Czech Republic ====
{{Main|Constitution of the Czech Republic}}

The Constitution of the Czech Republic, adopted in 1992 immediately before the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], establishes the traditional tripartite division of powers<ref name=CzechConst>{{cite web |url=http://www.psp.cz/cgi-bin/eng/docs/laws/1993/1.html |title=Constitution of the Czech Republic |publisher=Parliament of the Czech Republic |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530041428/http://www.psp.cz/cgi-bin/eng/docs/laws/1993/1.html |archivedate=30 May 2012}}</ref> and continues the tradition of its predecessor constitutions. The [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920]], which replaced the provisional constitution adopted by the newly independent state in 1918, was modelled after the constitutions of established [[democracy|democracies]] such as those of the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]] and [[France]], and maintained this division,<ref name="office">{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.cz/en/media-centrum/aktualne/constitution-1920-68721/|title=The 1920 Constitution – 90th anniversary of the adoption of the first Czechoslovak Constitution|publisher=The Office of the Government of the Czech Republic}}</ref> as have subsequent changes to the constitution that followed in 1948 with the [[Ninth-of-May Constitution]], the [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia]] as well as the [[Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation]] of 1968.

==== Denmark ====

* [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]], [[Cabinet of Denmark|Cabinet]], Government Departments and Civil Service – executive
* [[Courts of Denmark|High Courts and lower courts]] – judiciary

==== France ====
{{Main|Political system of France}}

According to the [[Constitution of the Fifth Republic]], the government of France<ref>Duguit, Leon (1911). ''Traite de droit constitutionnel'', vol. 1, ''La regle du droit: le probleme de l'Etat'', Paris: de Boccard, p. 645.</ref> is divided into three branches:
* Executive. This includes the popularly elected [[President of France|president]] as well as the [[Prime minister of france|prime minister]] and cabinet. The French Prime minister is nominated by the president, but the government is responsible to the lower house of the legislature, the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].
* [[Parliament of France|Legislature]]. A bicameral legislature that includes the [[French Senate|Senate]] (upper house) and the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] (lower house). The relationship between the two houses is asymmetric, meaning that in case of dispute, the National Assembly has the final word according to Article 45<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution du 4 octobre 1958|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Droit-francais/Constitution/Constitution-du-4-octobre-1958|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref> of the Constitution.
* [[Judiciary of France|Judiciary]]. This includes the judicial and administrative orders. It also includes a [[Constitutional Council of France|constitutional court]].

==== Hong Kong ====
{{main|Separation of powers in Hong Kong}}
[[Hong Kong]] is a [[Special Administrative Region]] established in 1997 pursuant to the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], an international treaty made between Britain and China in 1984, registered with the [[United Nations]]. The [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], a national law of China that serves as the ''de facto'' constitution, divides the government into Executive, Legislative, and Judicial bodies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html|title=Tha Basic Law : Chapter IV : Political Structure|accessdate=May 7, 2020|website=basiclaw.gov.hk}}</ref>

However, according to the former [[Secretary for Security]], [[Regina Ip]], also a current member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]](ExCo) and [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong never practices Separation of Powers after the handover of Hong Kong back to China.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.facebook.com/RTHKVNEWS/videos/566107990702099/?vh=e&d=n|title=Legislative Council Meeting May 7, 2020|accessdate=May 7, 2020|website=RTHK LegCo Meeting Live Broadcast, 01:06:20}}</ref>

Nevertheless, Hong Kong’s policy was decided by the Governor in Council before 1997, and it became the Chief Executive in Council afterwards. No matter when, some members of the Executive Council are also members of the Legislative Council. When the same person holds positions in the executive and legislative branches at the same time, the two powers are integrated rather than separated, and so it does not constitute a strict separation of powers, it is because checks and balances has been lost. This institutional practice existed long before 1997 during the British rule and has been followed ever since.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

==== India ====
{{Main|Lawmaking procedure in India|Constitution of India|Supreme Court of India}}
[[India]] follows [[constitutional democracy]] which offers a clear separation of powers. The judiciary is independent of the other two branches with the power to interpret the constitution. [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] has the legislative powers.

A note on the status of separation of power, checks and balances, and [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in Norway today.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Norwegian parliament description on Separation of powers|url=https://www.stortinget.no/no/Stortinget-og-demokratiet/Storting-og-regjering/Fordeling-av-makt/|publisher=Stortinget}}</ref>

In the original constitution of 1814 the Montesquieu concept was enshrined, and the people at the time had the same skepticism about political parties as the American founding fathers and the revolutionaries in France. Nor did people really want to get rid of the king and the Council of State (privy council). King and council was a known concept that people had lived with for a long time and for the most part were comfortable with. The 1814 constitution came about as a reaction to external events, most notable the [[Treaty of Kiel]] (see [[1814 in Norway]]). There was no revolution against the current powers, as had been the case in the U.S. and France.

As there was no election of the executive, the king reigned supremely independent in selecting the members of the Council of State, no formal political parties formed until the 1880s. A conflict between the executive and legislature started developing in the 1870s and climaxed with the legislature impeaching the entire Council of State in 1884 (see [[:no:Statsrådssaken|Statsrådssaken [Norwegian Wikipedia page]]]). With this came a switch to a [[parliamentary system]] of government. While the full process took decades, it has led to a system of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], where the Montesquieu idea of separation of powers is technically dead even though the three branches remain important institutions.

This ''does not'' mean that there are no checks and balances. With the introduction of a parliamentary system, political parties started to form quickly, which led to a call for electoral reform that saw the introduction of [[Party-list proportional representation]] in 1918. The peculiarities of the Norwegian election system generate 6–8 parties and make it extremely difficult for a single party to gain an absolute majority. It has only occurred for a brief period in the aftermath of World War II where the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] had an absolute majority.

A [[multi-party system]] parliament that must either form a minority executive or a coalition executive functions as a perfectly good system of checks and balances even if it was never a stated goal for the introduction of multiparty system. The multiparty system came about in response to a public outcry of having too few parties and a general feeling of a lack of representation. For this reason, very little on the topic of separation of powers or checks and balances can be found in the works of Norwegian political sciences today.

The development of the British constitution, which is not a [[Codification (law)|codified]] document, is based on fusion in the person of the Monarch, who has a formal role to play in the legislature (Parliament, which is where legal and political sovereignty lies, is the Crown-in-Parliament, and is summoned and dissolved by the Sovereign who must give his or her Royal Assent to all Bills so that they become Acts), the executive (the Sovereign appoints all ministers of His/Her Majesty's Government, who govern in the name of the Crown) and the judiciary (the Sovereign, as the fount of justice, appoints all senior judges, and all public prosecutions are brought in his or her name).

Although the [[doctrine]] of separation of power plays a role in the United Kingdom's constitutional life, the constitution is often described as having "a weak separation of powers" ([[A. V. Dicey]]) despite it being the one to which Montesquieu originally referred. For example, the executive forms a subset of the legislature, as did—to a lesser extent—the judiciary until the establishment of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]. The Prime Minister, the Chief Executive, sits as a member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], either as a peer in the [[House of Lords]] or as an elected member of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] (by convention, and as a result of the supremacy of the Lower House, the Prime Minister now sits in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]). Furthermore, while the courts in the United Kingdom are amongst the most independent in the world,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} the [[Law Lords]], who were the final arbiters of most judicial disputes in the U.K. sat simultaneously in the [[House of Lords]], the upper house of the legislature, although this arrangement ceased in 2009 when the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] came into existence. Furthermore, because of the existence of Parliamentary sovereignty, while the theory of separation of powers may be studied there, a system such as that of the U.K. is more accurately described as a "[[fusion of powers]]".{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Until 2005, the [[Lord Chancellor]] fused in his person the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary, as he was the ex officio [[Lord Speaker|Speaker of the House of Lords]], a Government Minister who sat in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] and was head of the [[Lord Chancellor's Department]], which administered the courts, the justice system and appointed judges, and was the head of the Judiciary in England and Wales and sat as a judge on the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords]], the highest domestic court in the entire United Kingdom, and the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], the senior tribunal court for parts of the Commonwealth. The [[Lord Chancellor]] also had certain other judicial positions, including being a judge in the Court of Appeal and President of the Chancery Division. The [[Lord Chancellor]] combines other aspects of the constitution, including having certain ecclesiastical functions of the [[Church of England|established state church]], making certain church appointments, nominations and sitting as one of the thirty-three Church Commissioners. These functions remain intact and unaffected by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005|Constitutional Reform Act]]. In 2005, the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005|Constitutional Reform Act]] separated the powers with Legislative functions going to an elected [[Lord Speaker]] and the Judicial functions going to the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]]. The [[Lord Chancellor's Department]] was replaced with a [[Ministry of Justice]] and the [[Lord Chancellor]] currently serves in the position of [[Secretary of State for Justice]].

The judiciary has no power to strike down primary legislation, and can only rule on secondary legislation that it is invalid with regard to the primary legislation if necessary.

Under the concept of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], [[Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons|Parliament]] can enact any primary legislation it chooses. However, the concept immediately becomes problematic when the question is asked, "If parliament can do anything, can it bind its successors?" It is generally held that parliament can do no such thing.

Equally, while statute takes precedence over precedent-derived common law and the judiciary has no power to strike down primary legislation, there are certain cases where the supreme judicature has effected an injunction against the application of an act or reliance on its authority by the civil service. The seminal example of this is the [[Factortame litigation|Factortame case]], where the House of Lords granted such an injunction preventing the operation of the ''Merchant Shipping Act 1988'' until litigation in the European Court of Justice had been resolved.

The House of Lords ruling in Factortame (No. 1), approving the European Court of Justice formulation that "a national court which, in a case before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule", has created an implicit tiering of legislative reviewability; the only way for parliament to prevent the supreme judicature from injunctively striking out a law on the basis of incompatibility with Community law is to pass an act specifically removing that power from the court, or by repealing the ''European Communities Act 1972''.

The British legal systems are based on [[common law]] traditions, which require:
* [[Police]] or [[Regulatory agency|regulators]] cannot initiate complaints under [[criminal law]] but can only investigate (prosecution is mostly reserved for the [[Crown Prosecution Service]]), which prevents [[selective enforcement]]—e.g., the "[[fishing expedition]]," which is often specifically forbidden.
* [[Prosecutor]]s cannot withhold evidence from [[Lawyer|counsel]] for the [[defendant]]; to do so results in [[Mistrials|mistrial]] or dismissal. Accordingly, their relation to police is no advantage.
* [[Defendant]]s convicted can [[appeal (law)|appeal]], but only fresh and compelling evidence not available at trial can be introduced, restricting the power of the [[court of appeal]] to the process of law applied.

==== United States ====
{{Main|Separation of powers under the United States Constitution}}

Separation of powers was first established in the [[United States Constitution]], wherein the founding fathers included features of many new concepts, including hard-learned historical lessons about the checks and balances of power. Similar concepts were also prominent in the state governments of the United States. As colonies of Great Britain, the founding fathers considered that the American states had suffered an abuse of the broad power of parliamentarism and monarchy. As a remedy, the United States Constitution limits the powers of the federal government through various means—in particular, the three branches of the federal government are divided by exercising different functions. The executive and legislative powers are separated in origin by separate elections, and the judiciary is kept independent. Each branch controls the actions of others and balances its powers in some way.

In the Constitution, Article 1 Section I grants Congress only those "legislative powers herein granted" and proceeds to list those permissible actions in Article I Section 8, while Section 9 lists actions that are prohibited for Congress. The vesting clause in Article II places no limits on the Executive branch, simply stating that "The Executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html |title=Constitution of the United States |publisher=Archives.gov |date=2000-09-15 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> The Supreme Court holds "The judicial Power" according to Article III, and [[judicial review]] was established in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' under the Marshall court.<ref>Madison, James. (8 February 1788) [http://www.foundingfathers.info/federalistpapers/fed51.htm "The Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks and Balances Between the Different Departments"] ''The Federalist Papers No. 51''</ref>

The presidential system adopted by the Constitution of the United States obeys the balance of powers sought, and not found, by the constitutional monarchy. The people appoint their representatives to meet periodically in a legislative body, and, since they do not have a king, the people themselves elect a preeminent citizen to perform, also periodically, the executive functions of the State.

The direct election of the head of state or of the executive power is an inevitable consequence of the political freedom of the people, understood as the capacity to appoint and depose their leaders. Only this separate election of the person who has to fulfill the functions that the Constitution attributes to the president, so different by its nature and by its function from the election of representatives of the electors, allows the executive power to be controlled by the legislative and submitted to the demands of political responsibility.<ref>{{Cite book|author-link=Antonio Garcia-Trevijano|title=A Pure Theory of Democracy|last=Garcia-Trevijano|first=Antonio|date=2009-09-30|publisher=[[University Press of America]]|isbn=9780761848561|location=Lanham, Md|language=English|translator-last=Peñaranda|translator-first=Miguel Rodríguez de}}</ref>{{Disputed inline||date=January 2020}}

[[Judicial independence]] is maintained by appointments for life, which remove any dependence on the Executive, with voluntary retirement and a high threshold for dismissal by the Legislature, in addition to a salary that cannot be diminished during their service.

The [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] refers to the branches as "branches of government", while some systems use "government" exclusively to describe the executive. The Executive branch has attempted<ref>See Bruce P. Frohnen, George W. Carey, ''Constitutional Morality and the Rise of Quasi-Law'', Harvard University Press, 2016.</ref> to claim power arguing for separation of powers to include being the Commander-in-Chief of a standing army since the [[American Civil War]], [[executive order]]s, emergency powers, security classifications since [[World War II]], national security, signing statements, and the scope of the [[Unitary executive theory|unitary executive]].<ref name="federalistNo51" />

{{Quote|
In order to lay a due foundation for that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of government, which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to be essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that each department should have a will of its own; and consequently should be so constituted that the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others. Were this principle rigorously adhered to, it would require that all the appointments for the supreme executive, legislative, and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the same fountain of authority, the people, through channels having no communication whatever with one another. Perhaps such a plan of constructing the several departments would be less difficult in practice than it may in contemplation appear. Some difficulties, however, and some additional expense would attend the execution of it. Some deviations, therefore, from the principle must be admitted. In the constitution of the judiciary department in particular, it might be inexpedient to insist rigorously on the principle: first, because peculiar qualifications being essential in the members, the primary consideration ought to be to select that mode of choice which best secures these qualifications; secondly, because the permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that department, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the authority conferring them.

It is equally evident, that the members of each department should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others, for the emoluments annexed to their offices. Were the executive magistrate, or the judges, not independent of the legislature in this particular, their independence in every other would be merely nominal.

==== Belgium ====

[[Belgium]] is currently a federated state that has imposed the ''{{Lang|la|trias politica}}'' on different governmental levels. The constitution of 1831, considered one of the most liberal of its time for limiting the powers of its monarch and imposing a rigorous system of separation of powers, is based on three principles (represented in the [[Schematic overview of Belgian institutions]]).

''{{Lang|la|Trias politica}}'' (horizontal separation of powers):

* The legislative power is attributed to a parliamentary body elected with through a representative general election system (one person, one vote).
* The executive power is attributed to the Council of Ministers. Ministers are formally appointed by the King though in practice the [[prime minister]] decides the composition of his cabinet. The ministers are usually from the elected members of parliament (although non-elected people can also be nominated); however, they must first resign from their elected seat.
* The judicial power is in the hands of the courts. Magistrates are nominated by the minister on proposal from a Council of the Magistrates.
** Magistrates can be nominated to become a judge (sitting magistrates) or instructing judge (investigating judge) of Procureur (public prosecutor) (the standing magistrates).
** The executive branch of the government is responsible for providing the physical means to execute its role (infrastructure, staff, financial means).
** Judges and some other people cannot run for elected office while they are nominated to certain positions (military, police-officers, clergy, notaries, bailiffs).

[[Subsidiarity]] (vertical separation of powers):
* Supranational directives (EU legislation) and international treaties are subjected to approval of the federal level (the federal level being Belgium the nation state)
* The federal level comprises the following:
** A bicameral parliament (House of Representatives and Senate) (in 2014 this will be a directly elected house and an indirectly appointed Senate of the regions)
** A federal government (led by the Prime Minister, ministers and secretaries of state)
*** Tasked with overseeing justice, defence, foreign affairs, social security, and public health
** High Court, Constitutional Court, Cassation Court and Council of State
* The regional level comprises the following:
** A unicameral parliament
** A regional government led by the minister-president (ministers and secretaries of state) is tasked with regional matters
* Provinces also have similar structures:
** A unicameral provincial council
** A nominated provincial governor assisted by deputies is tasked with provincial matters
** Appellate Court, Assizes Court
* An intermediate level of Arrondissements subdivides the provinces
** it has only an executive level with arrondissemental commissars
* City and communal entities (local government):
** A city or communal council
** A mayor, assisted by aldermen, is tasked with local matters
** Magistrates Court, Correctional Court (three judges)
** Justice of the peace and Police Court judges (single judge courts)

Secularism (separation of state and religion):
* The king, the head of state, holds no political authority and requires executive approval by a minister for every action and statement; he nominates the ministers but he does not choose them (his executive powers); he signs and decrees the laws voted in parliament (his legislative powers);
* The head of state is commander in chief of the military (in title only), politically the military depends on the Minister of Defence and the chiefs of staff are responsible towards parliament and take their orders from the Minister of Defence and the government;
* Certain functions are deemed incompatible and people must resign from their function if they want to assume responsibilities in another function (military commanders have never been government ministers, even during a war).

===== Republic of China =====
{{Main|Government of the Republic of China}}

According to [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s idea of "[[Five-Power Constitution|separation of the five powers]]", the government of the Republic of China has five branches:
* [[Executive Yuan]] – led by the [[Premier of the Republic of China|premier]] but in actuality it is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]] who sets policy – executive
* [[Legislative Yuan]] – [[unicameral]] – legislature
* [[Judicial Yuan]] – its Constitutional Court (highest) and [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]] have different jurisdictions – judiciary
* [[Control Yuan]] – audit branch
* [[Examination Yuan]] – civil service personnel management and human resources

The [[President of the Republic of China|president]] and [[Vice President of the Republic of China|vice president]] as well as the defunct [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] are constitutionally not part of the above five branches. Before being abolished in 2005, the National Assembly was a standing [[constituent assembly]] and [[electoral college]] for the president and vice president. Its constitutional amending powers were passed to the legislative yuan and its electoral powers were passed to the electorate.

The relationship between the executive and legislative branches are poorly defined. An example of the problems this causes is the near complete political paralysis that results when the president, who has neither the power to veto nor the ability to dissolve the legislature and call new elections, cannot negotiate with the legislature when his party is in the minority.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.fpri.org/enotes/asia.20020418.rigger.taiwanpoliticalparalysis.html |title = E-Notes: Why Taiwan's Political Paralysis PersistsFPRI |publisher=Foreign Policy Research Institute |date=18 April 2002 |author=Shelley Rigger |access-date=2008-10-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050210073526/http://www.fpri.org/enotes/asia.20020418.rigger.taiwanpoliticalparalysis.html |archive-date = 10 February 2005 }}</ref> The examination and control yuans are marginal branches; their leaders as well as the leaders of the executive and judicial yuans are appointed by the president and confirmed by the legislative yuan. The legislature is the only branch that chooses its own leadership. The vice president has practically no responsibilities.

===== People's Republic of China =====
{{Main|Government of China}}

The central government of the People's Republic of China is divided among several state organs:
# [[National People's Congress]] (NPC): the ultimate power of the state that makes the constitution and basic laws, and supervises and elects all following organs;
# [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC): the permanent legislative organ that makes most laws, interprets the constitution and laws, conducts [[constitutional review]], and supervises all following organs;
# [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]]: acts as a ceremonial [[head of state]] in compliance with decisions made by the NPCSC but exercises an independent power to nominate the Premier of the State Council;
# [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (synonymous with "Central People's Government"): the executive branch, whose [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] is the [[head of government]];
# [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC): the military branch, whose [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the national armed forces including the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), the [[People's Armed Police]] (PAP), and the [[Militia (China)|Militia]];

# [[Supreme People's Procuratorate]] (SPP): the prosecutorial branch.

==== Costa Rica ====

In the aftermath of the [[Costa Rican Civil War|43-day civil war]] in 1948 (after former [[President of Costa Rica|President]] and incumbent candidate [[Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia]] tried to take power through [[Voter fraud|fraud]], by not recognising the results of the [[1948 Costa Rican general election|presidential election]] that he had lost), the question of which transformational model the Costa Rican State would follow was the main issue that confronted the victors. A [[Constituent Assembly of Costa Rica|Constituent Assembly]] was elected by popular vote to draw up a new constitution, [[Costa Rican Constitution|enacted in 1949]], and remains in force. This document was an edit of the [[Costa Rican Constitution of 1871|constitution of 1871]], as the constituent assembly rejected more radical corporatist ideas proposed by the ruling [[Junta Fundadora de la Segunda República]] (which, although having come to power by military force, abolished the armed forces). Nonetheless, the new constitution increased centralization of power at the expense of municipalities and eliminated provincial government altogether, and at the time it increased the powers of congress and the judiciary.

It established the three supreme powers as the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, but also created two other autonomous state organs that have equivalent power, but not equivalent rank. The first is the [[Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones de Costa Rica]] (electoral branch), which controls elections and makes unique, unappealable decisions on their outcomes.

The second is the office of the [[Comptroller|Comptroller General]] (audit branch), an autonomous and independent organ nominally subordinate to the unicameral legislative assembly. All budgets of ministries and municipalities must pass through this agency, including the execution of budget items such as contracting for routine operations. The Comptroller also provides financial vigilance over government offices and office holders, and routinely brings actions to remove mayors for malfeasance, firmly establishing this organization as the fifth branch of the Republic.

==== European Union ====

The [[European Union]] is a supranational polity, and is neither a country nor a federation; but as the EU wields political power it complies with the principle of separation of powers. There are seven [[institutions of the European Union]]. In intergovernmental matters, most power is concentrated in the [[Council of the European Union]]—giving it the characteristics of a normal [[international organization]]. Here, all power at the EU level is in one branch. In the latter there are four main actors. The [[European Commission]] acts as an independent executive which is appointed by the Council in conjunction with the European Parliament; but the Commission also has a legislative role as the sole initiator of EU legislation.<ref>Bomberg, Elizabeth, Peterson, John, and [[Richard Corbett]], eds. ''The European Union: How Does it Work?''

As well as both executive and legislative functions, the Commission arguably exercises a third, quasi-judicial, function under Articles 101 & 102 TFEU (competition law ); although the ECJ remains the final arbiter. The [[European Parliament]] is one half of the legislative branch and is directly elected. The Council itself acts both as the second half of the legislative branch and also holds some executive functions (some of which are exercised by the related [[European Council]] in practice). The [[European Court of Justice]] acts as the independent judicial branch, interpreting EU law and treaties. The remaining institution, the [[European Court of Auditors]], is an independent audit authority (due to the sensitive nature of fraud in the EU).

==== Germany ====
The three branches in German government are further divided into six main bodies enshrined in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]]:
* Federal President (''[[President of Germany|Bundespräsident]]'') – formally executive, but mainly ''representative'' in daily politics
* Federal Cabinet (''[[Bundesregierung]]'') – executive
* Federal Diet (''[[Bundestag]]'') & Federal Council (''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'') – bicameral legislative
* Federal Assembly (''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'') – presidential electoral college (consisting of the members of the Bundestag and electors from the [[States of Germany|constituent states]])
* Federal Constitutional Court (''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'') – judiciary

Besides the constitutional court, the judicial branch at the federal level is made up of five supreme courts—one for civil and criminal cases (''Bundesgerichtshof''), and one each for administrative, tax, labour, and social security issues. There are also state-based (''[[States of Germany|Länder / Bundesländer]]'') courts beneath them, and a rarely used [[Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts of Germany|senate of the supreme courts]].

==== Hungary ====
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=August 2014}}
The four independent branches of power in Hungary (the parliament, the government, the court system, and the office of the public accuser) are divided into six bodies:
* [[National Assembly (Hungary)|Parliament]] (Magyar Országgyűlés): elected every 4 years by the people in a highly complex, one-round voting system
* [[Government of Hungary|Government]] (Magyar Kormány): installed and removed by simple majority vote of the parliament, 4-year terms
* [[Supreme Court of Hungary|Supreme Court]] (Legfelsőbb Bíróság): Chief justice elected by qualified (2/3) majority of the parliament, no government oversight
* [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional court]] (Alkotmánybíróság): members elected by qualified majority of the parliament for 8 years, this body nullifies laws and has no government oversight
* [[Chief Prosecutor of Hungary|Chief public accuser]] (Legfőbb ügyész): elected by qualified majority of the parliament, 6-year terms, office budget fixed, no government oversight
* [[List of heads of state of Hungary|The President of the Republic]] (Köztársasági Elnök) is elected by qualified majority of the Hungarian parliament for 5-year terms (cannot be reelected more than once). The President's task is to oversee the functioning of the democracy. Most of his/her powers are ceremonial only: like signing laws into power and commanding the military in time of peace. But before signing, he/she can also return accepted bills once with advices to the Parliament for reconsideration; he/she can also request nullification in advance from the Constitutional Court. He can negotiate with civil/professional unions regarding the bills. Without the President's permission, the country can neither declare war nor deploy the armed forces.

The independent pillar status of the Hungarian public accuser's office is a unique construction, loosely modelled on the system Portugal introduced after the 1974 victory of the [[Carnation Revolution]]. The public accuser (attorney general) body has become the fourth column of Hungarian democracy only in recent times: after communism fell in 1989, the office was made independent by a new clause (XI) of the Constitution. The change was meant to prevent abuse of state power, especially with regards to the use of false accusations against opposition politicians, who may be excluded from elections if locked in protracted or excessively severe court cases.

To prevent the Hungarian accuser's office from neglecting its duties, natural human private persons can submit investigation requests, called "pótmagánvád," directly to the courts if the accusers' office refuses to. Courts will decide if the allegations have merit and order police to act in lieu of the accuser's office if warranted. In its decision No. 42/2005, the Hungarian constitutional court declared that the government does not enjoy such privilege and the state is powerless to further pursue cases if the public accuser refuses to do so.
