During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], as medical supplies began to dwindle, nations began competing for supplies outside their jurisdictions, either paying companies to reroute or seizing equipment intended for other countries. Pellegrini said he booked two million masks from Ukraine, the requirement was payment in cash. However, a German agent appeared, paid more for the masks, and bought them. Ukraine Foreign Affairs Minister [[Dmytro Kuleba]] responded to the situation by saying there was no country in Europe that would not hunt face masks and respirators around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ukranews.com/en/news/690139-ukraine-was-ready-to-sell-slovakia-2-million-medical-face-masks-but-order-was-cut-off-prime|title=Ukraine Was Ready To Sell Slovakia 2 Million Medical Face Masks, But Order Was Cut Off – Prime Minister Of Slovakia Pellegrini|last=Zubkova|first=Dasha|date=2020-03-16|website=Ukrainian News}}</ref>
