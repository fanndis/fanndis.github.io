From 2013 until 2016, Hintze was one of the six Vice Presidents of the [[Bundestag]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/sterbehilfe-cdu-mann-peter-hintze-mit-vorstoss-gegen-eigene-partei-a-985209.html |title=Bundestagsvizepräsident: CDU-Politiker Hintze will Sterbehilfe ermöglichen |work=Der Spiegel |author=Müller, Peter |language=de |accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> He had previously been federal chairman of the  [[Evangelical Working Group of the CDU/CSU|Evangelical Working Group]] of the CDU/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] from 1990 to 1992 and general secretary of the CDU from 1992 to 1998. He was also Vice President of the [[Centrist Democrat International]].

==Political career==
Hintze served as a member of the German Bundestag from the [[1990 German federal election|1990 federal election]]. Between 1990 and 1992, he chaired the [[Evangelical Working Group of the CDU/CSU]].

In 1991/1992, Hintze briefly served as Parliamentary State Secretary at the [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth]] under minister [[Angela Merkel]] in the [[Fourth Kohl cabinet|fourth]] cabinet of [[Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]].

During the [[1994 German federal election|national election campaign in 1994]] Hintze was the driving force behind the ''Rote-Socken-Kampagne'' ("Red Socks Campaign"), a campaign which was directed against the left-wing [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]] and the alleged possibility of a coalition between the PDS and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]]. It is believed that the ''Rote-Socken-Kampagne'' contributed to the electoral victory of the CDU and [[Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]].

In autumn 2005, the [[Bundestagswahl 2005]] ended the [[Gerhard Schröder]] era; [[Angela Merkel]] became chancellor of [[First Merkel cabinet|a Union/SPD-cabinet]].  From 2005 to 2013, Hintze served as Parliamentary State Secretary at the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Germany)|Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Technology]] under ministers [[Michael Glos]] (2005–2009); [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] (2009); [[Rainer Brüderle]] (2009–2011); and [[Philipp Rösler]] (2011–2013) in the [[First Merkel cabinet|first]] and [[Second Merkel cabinet|second]] cabinets of [[Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]]. Between 2007 and 2013, he was also the government’s Coordinator of Aerospace Policy.

From 2006, Hintze led the Bundestag group of CDU parliamentarians from [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], the largest delegation within the CDU/CSU parliamentary group.

In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] of the Christian Democrats (CDU together with the Bavarian [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]) and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal elections]], Hintze was part of the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on foreign affairs, defense and development policy, led by [[Franz Josef Jung]] (CSU) and [[Werner Hoyer]] (FDP). Later, in the negotiations to form a ''[[Grand coalition (Germany)|Grand Coalition]]'' of Merkel's Christian Democrats and the SPD following the [[2013 German federal election|2013 German elections]], he was part of the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on [[bank regulation]] and the [[Eurozone]], led by [[Herbert Reul]] and [[Martin Schulz]].

In his capacity as vice-president, he was a member of the parliament’s [[Council of Elders of the Bundestag (Germany)|Council of Elders]], which – among other duties – determines daily legislative agenda items and assigning committee chairpersons based on party representation.

In 2015, Hintze appointed [[Diana Kinnert]] as his parliamentary chief of staff, which made her the youngest chief of staff in the history of the Bundestag.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.smartrecruiters.com/blog/diana-kinnert-interview/ |title=The People Behind the Podiums: A Background Primer on Diana Kinnert |work=SmartRecruiters |first=Peter |last=Braun |date=13 September 2018 |access-date=5 July 2020}}</ref>
