The '''Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act''' ('''SALSRA''',{{uspl|108|175}}) is a [[Bill (Proposed Law)|bill]] of the [[United States Congress]] passed into law on December 12, 2003.

The bill's stated purpose is to end what the United States sees as Syrian support for terrorism, to end Syria's presence in Lebanon, which has been in effect since the end of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1990, to stop Syria's alleged development of [[Weapons of mass destruction|WMD]]s, to cease Syria's illegal importation of Iraqi oil and to end illegal shipments of military items to anti-US forces in Iraq.

The bill was sponsored by Representative [[Eliot L. Engel]] (D) from New York and was introduced April 12, 2003.

==2013 Ghouta chemical attack==
In response to the use of chemical weapons against civilians during the 2013 [[Ghouta chemical attack]], president [[Barack Obama]] asked Congress to authorize the use of military force against Syria. An early draft of that authorization cites the Syria Accountability Act, saying:<ref>{{cite web| url= http://blogs.rollcall.com/wgdb/text-of-senate-draft-syria-war-authorization/ | title= Text of Senate Draft Syria War Authorization | date= September 3, 2013 | first= Niels|last= Lesniewski | publisher= [[Roll Call]] | accessdate=2013-09-04}}</ref>
<blockquote>Whereas in the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, Congress found that Syria’s acquisition of weapons of mass destruction threatens the security of the Middle East and the national security interests of the United States.</blockquote>
