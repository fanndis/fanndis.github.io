'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[Ukraine]] on 29 March 1998.<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] & Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1976 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref> The [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] remained the largest party in the [[Verkhovna Rada]], winning 121 of the 445 seats.<ref>Nohlen & Stöver, p1991</ref>

After the election votes in five electoral districts had too many irregularities to declare a winner and the parliament was five members short of 450.

==Electoral system==
In comparison to the [[1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election|first parliamentary election]], this time half of 450 parliament seats were filled by single-seat majority winners in 225 electoral regions (constituencies), and the other half were split among political parties and blocks<ref name="Ukrelectionsystem199820021994">[https://books.google.com/books?id=uD-9tyD2KrMC&pg=PA93 Against All Odds: Aiding Political Parties in Georgia and Ukraine (UvA Proefschriften)] by [[Max Bader]], [[Vossiuspers UvA]], 2010, {{ISBN|90-5629-631-0}} (page 93)</ref> that received at least 4% of the popular vote.<ref name="ukrainianweek223538a">[https://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/223538 Parliamentary chronicles], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (30 November 2018)</ref>

==Results==
The Communist Party of Ukraine was victorious in 18 regions including the city of Kyiv, while in three other regions the party finished in second place. The People's Movement of Ukraine (Rukh) won in five regions, all of them located in [[Western Ukraine]] and was a strong runner-up in three others, mostly in the west and Kyiv. The electoral block of Socialists and Peasants was able to secure a victory in only two regions, however it did finish strong in seven other regions across central Ukraine. The new and rising party of Hromada won the Dnipropetrovsk Region, while the Social-Democratic Party of Ukraine managed to secure the Zakarpattia Region.

Notable and strong runners up were the Party of Greens, the People's Democratic Party, the Progressive Socialist Party, the People's Party, Working Ukraine, the National Front and Our Ukraine.
