'''Ann Lois Romney''' (née '''Davies'''; born April 16, 1949) is an American equestrian, author, and philanthropist. She is the wife of businessman and politician, Senator [[Mitt Romney]] of [[Utah]]. From 2003 to 2007, Romney was [[First Lady]] of [[Massachusetts]], while her husband served as [[Governor of Massachusetts|governor]].

She was raised in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]], and attended the private [[Cranbrook Kingswood School|Kingswood School]] there, where she dated Mitt Romney. She converted to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) in 1966. She attended [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), married Mitt Romney in 1969, and in 1975 received a Bachelor of Arts degree in French.

As First Lady of Massachusetts, Romney served as the governor's liaison for federal faith-based initiatives.  She was involved in a number of children's charities, including [[Operation Kids]].  She was an active participant in her husband's U.S. presidential campaigns [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|in 2008]] and again [[Mitt Romney 2012 presidential campaign|in 2012]], when he was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee.

Romney was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 1998 and has credited a mixture of mainstream and alternative treatments with giving her a lifestyle mostly without limitations. In one activity, [[equestrianism]], she has consequently received recognition in [[dressage]] as an adult amateur at the national level and competed professionally in [[Grand Prix Dressage|Grand Prix]] as well.  In 2014 she opened the Ann Romney Center for Neurological Diseases at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] in Boston; it does intersectional research regarding multiple sclerosis and several other brain diseases.

Ann and Mitt Romney have five sons, born between 1970 and 1981, and twenty-four grandchildren.

== Multiple sclerosis ==
During 1997, Ann Romney began experiencing severe numbness, fatigue, and other symptoms,<ref name="bgseries4"/> and just before Thanksgiving in 1998, she was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name="bh2002prof"/><ref name="saddle" />  Mitt Romney described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as the worst day of his life.<ref name="bgseries4"/> He later said: "I couldn't operate without Ann.

Since then, she credits a mixture of mainstream and alternative treatments with giving her a lifestyle mostly without limitations.<ref name="usa071807"/> She initially used [[corticosteroid]]s, including intravenously, and credited them with helping stop the progression of the disease.<ref name="ap081104">{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/yourlife/health/diseases/articles/2004/08/11/romneys_wife_supports_ethical_stem_cell_work/ | title=Romney's wife supports 'ethical' stem cell work | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=August 11, 2004 | access-date=June 20, 2010}}</ref>  She then dropped them and other medications due to counterproductive [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]].<ref name="nyt121607"/>  She has partaken of [[reflexology]], [[acupuncture]], and [[craniosacral therapy]], and has said, "There is huge merit in both Eastern and Western medicine, and I've taken a little bit from both."<ref name="ap081104"/>  She is a board member for the New England chapter of the [[National Multiple Sclerosis Society]].<ref name="officialbio"/>

== Equestrianism ==
Romney is an avid [[Equestrianism|equestrian]], crediting her renewed involvement in it while in [[Park City, Utah]] (where the couple had built a vacation home and where they lived when he was in charge of the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games]]), for much of her recovery after her multiple sclerosis diagnosis<ref name="saddle"/><ref>{{cite news | first=Patricia |last=Lasko | url=http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_training/english/dressage/romney_070505/ | title=Dressage Helps Romney Cope with Multiple Sclerosis | magazine=Dressage Today | date= May 2004 | access-date= November 22, 2007}}</ref>  and for her continued ability to deal with the disease.<ref name="nyt121607"/>  She has said that riding "saved my life", explaining that, "I was losing most of the function of my right side.
