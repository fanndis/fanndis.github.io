'''John Ramsay Swinney''' (born 13 April 1964) is a Scottish politician serving as [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland]] since 2014 and [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills]] since 2016. A member of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), Swinney has also served as the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for [[Perthshire North (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Perthshire North]] since 2011, having previously represented [[North Tayside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|North Tayside]] from 1999 to 2011.

Swinney served in the [[British House of Commons]] as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Tayside North (UK Parliament constituency)|Tayside North]] from 1997 to 2001. After [[Alex Salmond]] resigned the leadership in [[2000 Scottish National Party leadership election|2000]], Swinney was elected [[Leader of the Scottish National Party]] in the ensuring leadership election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/conferences/snp/938727.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} In Depth {{!}} Conferences {{!}} SNP {{!}} Emphatic SNP win for Swinney|publisher=BBC|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Swinney's leadership proved ineffectual, with a loss of one MP in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] and a further reduction to 27 MSPs in [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003]] despite the [[Officegate]] scandal unseating previous [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Henry McLeish]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/scotland/2001/mcleish_resignation/1645219.stm|title=McLeish steps down|date=2001-11-08|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> However, the only parties to gain seats in that election where the [[Scottish Greens]] and the [[Scottish Socialist Party|Scottish Socialist Party (SSP)]] which like the SNP support independence. After an unsuccessful [[2003 Scottish National Party leadership election|coup attempt]] in 2003, Swinney stepped down following disappointing results in the [[2004 European Parliament election|European elections of 2004]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/euro-poll-was-breaking-point-swinney-2507632|title=Euro poll was breaking point for Swinney|website=The Scotsman|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> with Salmond elected in the [[2004 Scottish National Party leadership election|subsequent 2004 leadership contest]]. 

The SNP won the highest number of seats in the Scottish Parliament in [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|the 2007 election]] and Salmond was subsequently appointed First Minister. Swinney served under Salmond as [[Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth]] from 2007 to 2014. After [[Nicola Sturgeon]] succeeded Salmond, she appointed Swinney as [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland]] in 2014. He also served as [[Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Constitution and Economy]], until that role was divided into two posts in the [[second Sturgeon government]] as a result of the [[Scotland Act 2016|expansion]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]]'s financial powers; he was then appointed Education Secretary.

==Early life==
Swinney was born in the [[Western General Hospital]], [[Edinburgh]], the son of Kenneth Swinney, a [[Automobile repair shop|garage]] manager. His uncle [[Tom Hunter (VC)|Tom Hunter]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] whilst serving with the [[Royal Marines]] in [[World War II]].<ref name=Scotsman>{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh/School39s-Victoria-Cross-hero-honoured.6189808.jp|title=School's Victoria Cross hero honoured at memorial move|work=The Scotsman article|publisher=The Scotsman|accessdate=2010-04-12|location=Edinburgh|first=Gemma|last=Fraser|date=2010-03-30}}</ref> He was educated at [[Forrester High School]], before attending the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he graduated with an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] Honours degree in [[politics]] in 1986.

==Early political career==

Swinney joined the SNP at the age of 15, citing his anger at the way in which Scotland had been portrayed by television commentators at the [[1978 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]].  He involved himself in the [[Young Scottish Nationalists|SNP Youth Wing]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mMRAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9qUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4063%2C1901942 |title=TV-am may have the morning off |first=Andrew |last=Young |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |page=1 |date=11 May 1983 |accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref> and gradually became more active in the party, becoming firstly the SNP assistant national secretary and then the national secretary in 1986, at the age of 22.

Swinney was a research officer for the Scottish Coal Project (1987–1988), a senior management consultant with Development Options (1988–1992), and a strategic planning principal with Scottish Amicable (1992–1997). In the SNP, he served as national secretary until 1992, then vice convenor, later senior vice-convenor (deputy leader) 1992–1997. At the time of the 1990 leadership contest he supported [[Margaret Ewing]] in her bid to become SNP leader, but this did not stop him becoming politically close to the man who went on to win that contest, [[Alex Salmond]].

==Political career==

===House of Commons ===
At the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], he was elected as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Tayside North (UK Parliament constituency)|Tayside North]] constituency, and in [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]] he was elected to represent the same area at the [[Scottish Parliament]].

He stood down as a Westminster MP at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] in order to avoid splitting his time, in line with all of his colleagues who found themselves in a similar 'dual mandate' position.

===Scottish Parliament===

====Leader of the SNP====
The leadership contest in 2000, caused by [[Alex Salmond]]'s decision to step down as party leader, was marked by serious argument between the [[SNP Gradualist|Gradualist]] wing of the party, who in the main supported Swinney and the [[SNP Fundamentalist|Fundamentalist]] wing, who in the main supported [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]].  Swinney won the contest but the media raised some doubt about his ability to lead the party following poor SNP performances in the 2001 UK General Election and the 2003 Scottish Parliamentary Election. He defeated a leadership challenge from [[Bill Wilson (Scottish politician)|Bill Wilson]] in 2003, defeating Wilson by 577 votes to 111.

Though retaining its two seats at the [[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2004 European elections]], in a smaller field of 7 (Scotland up until then had 8 MEPs) the Scottish press and certain elements within the fundamentalist wing of the Party depicted the result as a disaster for the SNP putting further pressure on Swinney who resigned soon afterwards on 22 June 2004.

====Finance Secretary ====
[[File:Scottish Cabinet around the Cabinet Table, June 2007.jpg|thumb|Finance Secretary Swinney as a member of the [[First Salmond government]] in the Cabinet Room.]]
After the SNP emerged as the largest party following the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 Scottish Parliament Election]], Swinney led coalition talks with the [[Scottish Green Party]].<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=731202007 "SNP tipped to bring in Greens for minority rule"], ''Edinburgh Evening News'', 11 May 2007</ref> He was later appointed [[Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth]] in the Cabinet of the minority SNP government.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6663031.stm |title=Salmond announces his new cabinet |work=BBC News |date=16 May 2007}}</ref>

As response to Swinney not notifying the Scottish Parliament that he had let the [[Scottish Variable Rate]] lapse due to not funding this tax mechanism, the Scottish Parliament voted to censure him and called his actions "an abuse of power".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/scotland/8157957/John-Swinney-says-sorry-over-tax-power-giveaway.html|title=John Swinney says sorry over tax power giveaway|date=24 November 2010|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> Subsequently, a freedom of information request showed that even if Swinney had funded the mechanism, problems and delays in the HM Revenue & Customs computer system made any collection of the tax impossible. The Scottish Government added, "The power has not lapsed, the HMRC simply does not have an IT system capable of delivering a ten-month state of readiness."<ref name="Scotsman 16Jan2011">{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk-taxman-killed-off-tartan-tax-1-1493191 |title=UK taxman killed off Tartan Tax |first=Eddie |last=Barnes |work=The Scotsman |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/scotnews11/110116-tartan.html UK taxman killed off Tartan Tax<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119034143/http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/scotnews11/110116-tartan.html |date=19 January 2011 }}</ref>

====Cabinet Secretary for Education====

Following the election of the SNP to lead the [[Scottish Government]] following the 2016 Scottish Parliamentary elections, Swinney, for the first time in nine years, was shifted from his roles as Cabinet Secretary for the Economy to [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36323276|title=Scottish cabinet reshuffle: John Swinney becomes education secretary|date=18 May 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

In August 2020 he was subject to a vote of no confidence in Parliament, with the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats  all accusing Swinney of creating an exam results system which “unfairly penalised pupils at schools which had historically not performed so well”.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-53760012|title=Education Secretary John Swinney faces no-confidence vote|date=12 August 2020|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> However the No Confidence vote tabled by [[Iain Gray]] of the [[Scottish Labour]] party, was defeated by 67 votes to 58 resulting in John Swinney surviving the vote and remaining as Scottish Education Secretary.

==Personal life==
He joined the [[Scottish National Party]] in 1979 at the age of 15 and has held several posts within the party at local and national level, including National Secretary, Vice Convener for Publicity and Depute Leader. In 2000, Swinney was elected Leader (or National Convenor) of the SNP, becoming Leader of the Opposition in the [[Scottish Parliament]]. He stood down as SNP leader in 2004 and became Convener of the Scottish Parliament's European and External Relations Committee.

Swinney was previously a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Tayside North (UK Parliament constituency)|Tayside North]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], before taking the same seat in the Scottish Parliament's [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]], [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003]] and [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 elections]]. In 2007 he achieved the largest constituency vote for any candidate in Scotland. At the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|election in May 2011]], he was re-elected with 18,219 votes, and a majority of 10,353. Swinney's vote was the second highest in Scotland, second only to the then [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]], [[Alex Salmond]] MSP.

Following [[Nicola Sturgeon]] taking the office of First Minister, it was announced on 21 November 2014 that Swinney would become Deputy First Minister of Scotland in a cabinet reshuffle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland-decides/300461-new-first-minister-nicola-sturgeon-to-announce-cabinet-reshuffle/|title=New First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to announce Cabinet reshuffle|work=STV News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123183951/http://news.stv.tv/scotland-decides/300461-new-first-minister-nicola-sturgeon-to-announce-cabinet-reshuffle/|archivedate=23 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Born in [[Edinburgh]], Swinney was educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]], and prior to his election to the UK Parliament in 1997, he was employed as Strategic Planning Principal with Scottish Amicable. Swinney is married and has three children.
