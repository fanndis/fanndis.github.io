After finishing his higher education, Kinakh started his engineering career at the [[Tallinn]] shipyard. From 1981 he worked at the [[Mykolaiv]] plant "Ocean".

===Political career===
In April 1990, he was elected to the Ukrainian parliament the Verkhovna Rada. There he worked on a committee dealing with economic reforms. In 1992, Kinakh was appointed as a representative of the President in the [[Mykolaiv Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]) of southern Ukraine. In 1995, Anatoliy Kinakh was appointed Vice-[[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] in the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|Cabinet]] of [[Yevhen Marchuk]] concerned with industrial affairs.

In the early 1990s, Mr. Kinakh held several posts in the local government of Mykolayiv Oblast. From 1995 to 1996 Kinakh was the Minister of Industrial Policy.

Anatoliy Kinah was appointed as the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] from May 29, 2001 to November 21, 2002.<ref>{{Cite Ukrainian law|type=[[Verkhovna Rada|Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine]] decree|number=2466-III|law=2466-14|name=On consent to the appointment of Prime Minister Kinakh A.K by the President of Ukraine|date=2001-05-29}}</ref> [[Kinakh Government|His reasonably popular cabinet]] was unexpectedly dismissed by President [[Leonid Kuchma]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In 2002, he was elected to [[Verkhovna Rada]] on the list of the electoral bloc of parties "[[For United Ukraine]]."

In the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004 presidential election]] Anatoliy Kinakh was a candidate for the post of President of Ukraine, nominated by the [[Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Ukraine]], which he has chaired since 2000. A particular feature of his election program is a pro-Ukrainian choice in foreign policy, saying that entry to the [[European Union]] should not be a barrier to the development of relationships with all [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] countries as well as with [[Russia]].

During the election campaign, Kinakh publicly broke ties with government-backed candidate and then Prime Minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]] by declaring that no criminal can hold the post of [[President of Ukraine]]. He later took an active part in the [[Orange Revolution]] on the side of opposition leader [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (who was elected president).
