'''Robert Upshur Woodward''' (born March 26, 1943) is an American [[investigative journalist]]. He started working for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as a reporter in 1971 and currently holds the title of associate editor.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/bob-woodward/ "Bob Woodward"].

While a young reporter for ''The Washington Post'' in 1972, Woodward teamed up with [[Carl Bernstein]]; the two did much of the original news reporting on the [[Watergate scandal]]. These scandals led to numerous government investigations and the eventual resignation of President [[Richard Nixon]]. The work of Woodward and Bernstein was called "maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time" by journalist [[Gene Roberts (journalist)|Gene Roberts]].<ref>Roy J. Harris, Jr., ''Pulitzer's Gold'', 2007, p. 233, Columbia: University of Missouri Press, {{ISBN|9780826217684}}.</ref>

Woodward continued to work for ''The Washington Post'' after his reporting on Watergate. He has since written 19 books on American politics, 13 of which have topped best-seller lists.

==Early life, education and naval service==
Woodward was born in [[Geneva, Illinois]], the son of Jane (née Upshur) and [[Alfred E. Woodward]], a lawyer who later became chief judge of the 18th Judicial Circuit Court. He was raised in nearby [[Wheaton, Illinois]], and educated at Wheaton Community High School (WCHS), a public high school in the same town.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.illinoisreview.com/illinoisreview/2006/11/illinois_hall_o_15.html|work=Illinois Review|title=Illinois Hall of Fame: Bob Woodward|author=Mark Rhoads|date=November 18, 2006|access-date=September 10, 2020}}</ref> His parents divorced when he was twelve, and he and his brother and sister were raised by their father, who subsequently remarried.<ref>Barbara Matusow.

''Newsday'', September 18, 1987, p. 2.</ref> Following graduation from WCHS in 1961, Woodward enrolled in [[Yale College]] with a [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] (NROTC) scholarship and studied history and English literature. While at Yale, Woodward joined the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] fraternity and was a member of the [[secret society]] [[Book and Snake]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/fashion/jeff-himmelmans-new-biography-of-ben-bradlee.html |title=The Protégé's Pen: Portrayal or Betrayal |first=Alexandra |last=Robbins |date=May 11, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phigam.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=902|title=Phi Gamma Delta – Famous Fijis – education |publisher=Phigam.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929022316/http://www.phigam.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=902 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He received his B.A. degree in 1965.<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bob-Woodward |title=Bob Woodward: American Journalist and Author |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]}}</ref>

After Yale, Woodward began a five-year tour of duty in the [[United States Navy]].<ref name=EB/> During his service in the Navy, Woodward served aboard the [[USS Wright (CVL-49)|USS ''Wright'']], and was one of two officers assigned to move or handle nuclear launch codes the ''Wright'' carried in its capacity as a [[National Emergency Command Post Afloat]] (NECPA).<ref name="RavenRock">{{cite book |title=Raven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government's Secret Plan to Save Itself – While the Rest of Us Die |first=Garrett M. |last=Graff |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=2017}}</ref> At one time, he was close to Admiral Robert O.

==Career==
After being discharged as a [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] in August 1970, Woodward was admitted to [[Harvard Law School]] but elected not to attend. Instead, he applied for a job as a reporter for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' while taking graduate courses in [[Shakespeare]] and [[international relations]] at [[George Washington University]]. [[Harry M. Rosenfeld]], the ''Post'''s metropolitan editor, gave him a two-week trial but did not hire him because of his lack of journalistic experience. After a year at the ''[[Montgomery Sentinel]]'', a weekly newspaper in the Washington, D.C., suburbs, Woodward was hired as a ''Post'' reporter in 1971.<ref>Woodward, Bob, ''The Secret Man'', pp. 17–20, 27–35, Simon and Schuster, 2005</ref>

===Watergate===
{{Main|Watergate scandal}}
{{Watergate|Journalists}}

Woodward and [[Carl Bernstein]] were both assigned to report on the June 17, 1972, burglary of the headquarters of the [[Democratic National Committee]] in a Washington, D.C., office building called [[Watergate complex|Watergate]]. Their work, under editor [[Benjamin C. Bradlee|Ben Bradlee]], became known for being the first to report on a number of political "dirty tricks" used by the [[Committee to Re-elect the President|Nixon re-election committee]] during his campaign for re-election. Their book about the scandal, ''[[All the President's Men]]'', became a No. 1 bestseller and was later turned into a movie. [[All the President's Men (film)|The 1976 film]], starring [[Robert Redford]] as Woodward and [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Bernstein, transformed the reporters into celebrities and inspired a wave of interest in [[investigative journalism]].

The book and movie also led to the enduring mystery of the identity of Woodward's [[Protection of sources|secret]] Watergate informant known as [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]], a reference to the title of a [[Deep Throat (film)|popular pornographic movie]] at the time. Woodward said he would protect Deep Throat's identity until the man died or allowed his name to be revealed. For more than 30 years, only Woodward, Bernstein, and a handful of others knew the informant's identity until it was claimed by his family to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine to be former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] Associate Director [[W. Mark Felt]] in May 2005. Woodward immediately confirmed the veracity of this claim and subsequently published a book, titled ''The Secret Man'', that detailed his relationship with Felt.

Woodward and Bernstein followed up ''All the President’s Men'' with a second book on Watergate, entitled ''[[The Final Days]]'' (Simon and Schuster 1976), covering in extensive depth the period from November 1973 until President Nixon resigned in August 1974.

The Woodward and Bernstein Watergate Papers are housed at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].

=== "Jimmy's World" scandal ===

In September 1980, a Sunday feature story appeared on the front page of the ''Post'' titled "Jimmy's World" in which reporter [[Janet Cooke]] wrote a profile of the life of an eight-year-old heroin [[Substance dependence|addict]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/09/28/jimmys-world/605f237a-7330-4a69-8433-b6da4c519120/|title=Jimmy's World|last=Cooke|first=Janet|date=September 28, 1980|website=Washington Post|access-date=July 9, 2016}}</ref> Although some within the ''Post'' doubted the story's veracity, it was defended by the paper's editors including Woodward, who was assistant managing editor. It was Woodward who submitted the story for [[Pulitzer Prize]] consideration, and Cooke was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing]] on April 13, 1981. The story was then found to be a complete fabrication, and the Pulitzer was returned. In retrospect, Woodward made the following statement:
{{quote|I think that the decision to nominate the story for a Pulitzer is of minimal consequence. I also think that it won is of little consequence. It is a brilliant story—fake and fraud that it is. It would be absurd for me or any other editor to review the authenticity or accuracy of stories that are nominated for prizes.<ref name="'Jimmy's World'">{{cite news |last1=Green |first1=Bill |title=THE PRIZE: Of Fiefdoms and Their Knights |url= http://academics.smcvt.edu/dmindich/Jimmy's%20World.htm |access-date=14 Sep 2018 |work="Jimmy's World" |agency=The Washington Post |issue=''Post'' Ombudsman quoting Bob Woodward |date=April 19, 1981 |page=A14 |quote=I think that the decision to nominate the story for a Pulitzer is of minimal consequence.

===1996 campaign finance controversy===
China's alleged role in the [[1996 United States campaign finance controversy]] first gained public attention when Woodward and Brian Duffy published a story stating that a [[United States Department of Justice]] investigation into the fund-raising activities had uncovered evidence that [[Chinese intelligence activity abroad|Chinese agents]] sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) before the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 presidential campaign]]. The journalists wrote that intelligence information had shown the [[Embassy of China in Washington, D.C.|Chinese embassy]] in Washington, D.C. was used for coordinating contributions to the DNC.<ref name=embassy>Woodward, Bob and Duffy, Brian, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/china1.htm "Chinese Embassy Role In Contributions Probed"], ''Washington Post'', February 13, 1997
</ref>

===George W. Bush administration===
Woodward spent more time than any other journalist with former President [[George W. Bush]], interviewing him six times for close to 11 hours total.<ref>"The War Within" p. 443</ref> Woodward's four books, ''[[Bush at War]]'' (2002), ''[[Plan of Attack]]'' (2004), ''[[State of Denial]]'' (2006), and ''[[The War Within: A Secret White House History (2006–2008)]]'' (2008) are detailed accounts of the Bush presidency, including the response to the [[September 11 attacks]] and the wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]].
In a series of articles published in January 2002, he and [[Dan Balz]] described the events at [[Camp David]] in the aftermath of September 11 and discussed the [[Worldwide Attack Matrix]].

Woodward believed the Bush administration's claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction prior to the war. During an appearance on [[Larry King Live]], he was asked by a telephone caller, "Suppose we go to war and go into Iraq and there are no [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]", Woodward responded "I think the chance of that happening is about zero. There's just too much there."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newswar/interviews/woodward.html|title=Interviews – Bob Woodward |last=Frontline|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/173245/bob-woodwards-biggest-failure-iraq |title=Bob Woodward's Biggest Failure: Iraq |last=Mitchell |first=Greg |work=[[The Nation]] |date=March 7, 2013 |access-date=March 8, 2003}}</ref> Woodward later admitted his error saying, "I think I dropped the ball here.

In 2008, as a part of the [[Google Talks]] series, Woodward, who was interviewed by Google CEO [[Eric Schmidt]], said that he had a fourth book in his ''Bush at War'' series in the making. He then added jokingly that his wife had told him that she would kill him if he decides to write a fifth in the series.<ref>{{YouTube|r3N4pJFPAKs|Authors@Google: Bob Woodward}}</ref>

====Involvement in the Plame scandal====
{{Main|Plame affair}}
On November 14, 2005, Woodward gave a two-hour [[deposition (law)|deposition]] to Special Counsel [[Patrick Fitzgerald]]. He testified that a senior administration official told him in June 2003 that [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]] critic [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joe Wilson]]'s wife (later identified as [[Valerie Plame]]), worked for the CIA as a WMD analyst, not as an undercover operative.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/15/AR2005111501857.html|title=Woodward Was Told of Plame More Than Two Years Ago|last1=VandeHei|first1=Jim|date=November 16, 2005|last2=Leonnig|first2=Carol D.|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> Woodward appears to have been the first reporter to learn about her employment (albeit not her name) from a government source. The deposition was reported in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on November 16, 2005, and was the first time Woodward revealed publicly that he had any special knowledge about the case. Woodward testified the information was given to him in a "casual" and "offhand" manner, and said that he does not believe it was part of any coordinated effort to "out" Plame as a CIA employee.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/15/AR2005111501829.html |title=Testifying in the CIA Leak Case |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= November 16, 2005|access-date=March 7, 2010}}</ref> Later, Woodward's source identified himself. It was [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]], [[Colin Powell]]'s deputy and an internal critic of the Iraq War and the White House inner circle.

Woodward said the revelation came at the end of a long, confidential background interview for his 2004 book ''[[Plan of Attack]]''. He did not reveal the official's disclosure at the time because it did not strike him as important. Later, he kept it to himself because it came as part of a confidential conversation with a source.

In his deposition, Woodward also said that he had conversations with [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]] after the June 2003 conversation with his confidential administration source, and testified that it is possible that he might have asked Libby further questions about Joe Wilson's wife before her employment at the CIA and her identity were publicly known.

Woodward apologized to [[Leonard Downie]] Jr., editor of ''The Washington Post'', for not informing him earlier of the June 2003 conversation. Downie accepted the apology and said even had the paper known it would not have changed its reporting.

[[New York University]] professor [[Jay Rosen]] severely criticized Woodward for allegedly being co-opted by the Bush White House and also for not telling the truth about his role in the [[Plame affair]], writing: "Not only is Woodward not in the hunt, but he is slowly turning into the hunted. Part of what remains to be uncovered is how Woodward was played by the Bush team, and what they thought they were doing by leaking to him, as well as what he did with the dubious information he got."<ref name=Rosen>[[Jay Rosen]], [http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2006/04/09/waas_now.html "Murray Waas Is Our Woodward Now"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829020551/http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2006/04/09/waas_now.html |date=August 29, 2010 }}, ''PressThink'' (blog), April 9, 2006, accessed June 21, 2007</ref>

===Other professional activities===
Although Woodward is no longer employed by the ''Post,'' Woodward has continued to write books and report stories for ''The Washington Post'', and has the title of associate editor at the paper, which was described by ''Post'' media columnist [[Margaret Sullivan (journalist)|Margaret Sullivan]] as [[honorific]] with no regular responsibilities.<ref name=":0" /> He focuses on the presidency, intelligence, and Washington institutions such as the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], [[The Pentagon]], and the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]]. He also wrote the book ''[[Wired (book)|Wired]]'', about the [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] drug culture and the death of comic [[John Belushi]].

In 2018, Woodward announced participation in an online class on investigative journalism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/two-time-pulitzer-prize-winner-bob-woodward-joins-masterclass-to-teach-investigative-journalism-300552737.html|title=Two-Time Pulitzer Prize-Winner Bob Woodward Joins MasterClass to Teach Investigative Journalism|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=February 21, 2018}}</ref>

===Sequester dispute with Obama administration===
On February 22, 2013, shortly before the [[Budget sequestration in 2013|United States federal budget sequester]] took effect, ''The Washington Post'' published a column by Woodward in which he criticized the Obama administration for their statements in 2012 and 2013 that the sequester had been proposed by Republicans in Congress; Woodward said his research showed that the sequester proposal had originated with the White House.<ref name="WAPOSEQUESTER">{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bob-woodward-obamas-sequester-deal-changer/2013/02/22/c0b65b5e-7ce1-11e2-9a75-dab0201670da_story.html|title= Obama's sequester deal-changer|last1=Woodward |first1= Bob|date=February 28, 2013 |website=The Washington Post |access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/19/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-2192013 |title= Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney |date=February 19, 2013 |publisher=The White House|access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref> Press Secretary [[Jay Carney]] confirmed, "The sequester was something that was discussed, and as has been reported, it was an idea that the White House put forward."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bob-woodward-obamas-sequester-deal-changer/2013/02/22/c0b65b5e-7ce1-11e2-9a75-dab0201670da_story.html|title=Bob Woodward: Obama's sequester deal-changer|last=Woodward|first=Bob|date=February 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>

On February 27, Woodward told ''[[Politico]]'' that before the column was published, Woodward had called a senior White House official, later identified by reporters as economic adviser [[Gene Sperling]], to discuss the piece, and that the official had "yelled at [Woodward] for about a half-hour" before sending him a page-long email that included the sentence, "I think you will regret staking out that claim." In ''Politico'''s reporting, Woodward's focus on that line was described as "making clear he saw [that sentence] as a veiled threat", although Woodward did not use the word "threat" or "threatened".<ref name = "POLITICO">{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/woodward-at-war-88212.html |title=Behind the Curtain: Bob Woodward at war |last1= Allen|first1=Mike |last2=Vandehei |first2=Jim |date=February 27, 2013|publisher=Politico.com |access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref> Several other sources also indicated that Woodward had expressed the line as an intended threat.<ref name = "TELEGRAPH">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/9899247/Watergate-journalist-Bob-Woodward-threatened-by-White-House.html |title=Watergate journalist Bob Woodward 'threatened' by White House |date=February 28, 2013 |publisher=The Telegraph |access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name = "CNNTICKER">{{cite web |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/02/27/bob-woodward-says-he-was-threatened-by-white-house/?hpt=hp_t1 |title=Bob Woodward says he was threatened by White House |date=February 27, 2013 |publisher=CNN |access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name="WAPOSEQUESTER2">{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/02/28/bob-woodward-white-house-threatened-me/|title= Bob Woodward: White House said I would 'regret' it if I pursued the story|last1=Blake |first1= Aaron|date=February 28, 2013 |website=The Washington Post |access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref>

The next day, ''Politico'' published the complete email exchange between Woodward and Sperling. Sperling's statements leading up to the "regret" line read: "But I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying that Potus asking for revenues is moving the goal post. I know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/exclusive-the-woodward-sperling-emails-revealed-88226.html |title=The Woodward, Sperling emails revealed |last1= Allen|first1=Mike |last2=Vandehei |first2=Jim |date=February 28, 2013|publisher=Politico.com |access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref> The White House subsequently released a statement that "of course no threat was intended...The note suggested that Mr. Woodward would regret the observation he made regarding the sequester because that observation was inaccurate, nothing more."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/02/28/173135931/the-meaning-of-regret-journalist-bob-woodward-white-house-disagree |title= The Meaning Of 'Regret': Journalist Bob Woodward, White House Disagree |last1=Neuman |first1=Scott |date=February 28, 2013 |publisher=NPR |access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref> Upon release of the emails, several conservative commentators indicated they no longer agreed with characterizing the "regret" statement as a threat.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/conservatives-regret-taking-woodwards-threat-story-seriously |title= Conservatives Regret Taking Woodward's 'Threat' Story Seriously |last1=Taintor |first1=David |date=February 28, 2013 |publisher=Talking Points Memo |access-date=April 1, 2013}}</ref>

In a February 28 [[Fox News Channel]] interview, Woodward said he had never used the word "threat" but said Sperling's conduct was "not the way to operate in a White House". He also said: "I've been flooded with emails from people in the press saying this is exactly the way the White House works, they are trying to control and they don't want to be challenged or crossed".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/02/28/hannity-exclusive-bob-woodward-speaks-out-on-threat-from-the-white-house-its-not-the-way-to-operate-in-a-white-house/ |archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130312060125/http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/02/28/hannity-exclusive-bob-woodward-speaks-out-on-threat-from-the-white-house-its-not-the-way-to-operate-in-a-white-house |url-status= dead |archive-date= March 12, 2013 |title= 'Hannity' Exclusive – Bob Woodward Speaks Out on Threat From the White House: 'It's Not the Way to Operate in a White House' |date= February 28, 2013 |publisher= Fox News |access-date= April 1, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> ''[[National Journal]]'' editor [[Ron Fournier]], conservative ''Washington Post'' columnist [[Jennifer Rubin (journalist)|Jennifer Rubin]], and Fox News contributor and former [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] adviser [[Lanny Davis]] expressed support for Woodward; Fournier and Davis described similar experiences with Obama administration officials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/why-bob-woodward-s-fight-with-the-white-house-matters-to-you-20130228|title=Why Bob Woodward's Fight With The White House Matters to You|last=Fournier|first=Ron|date=February 28, 2013|publisher=National Journal|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303010101/http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/why-bob-woodward-s-fight-with-the-white-house-matters-to-you-20130228|archive-date=March 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmal.com/common/page.php?pt=WMAL+EXCLUSIVE%3A+Woodward%27s+Not+Alone+-+Fmr.+Clinton+Aide+Davis+Says+He+Received+White+House+Threat&id=8924&is_corp=0|title= Woodward's Not Alone – Fmr.

==Career recognition and awards==
Although not a recipient in his own right, Woodward made contributions to two [[Pulitzer Prizes]] won by ''The Washington Post''.

Woodward himself has been a recipient of nearly every major American journalism award, including the [[Heywood Broun]] award (1972), Worth Bingham Prize for Investigative Reporting (1972 and 1986), [[Sigma Delta Chi Award]] (1973), [[George Polk]] Award (1972), [[William Allen White]] Medal (2000), and the [[Gerald R. Ford]] Prize for Reporting on the Presidency (2002). In 2012, [[Colby College]] presented Woodward with the [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award]] for courageous journalism as well as an honorary doctorate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Strachota|first=Madeline|title=Woodward to receive 2012 Lovejoy award|url=http://www.thecolbyecho.com/news/woodward-to-receive-2012-lovejoy-award|publisher=The Colby Echo|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224084502/http://www.thecolbyecho.com/news/woodward-to-receive-2012-lovejoy-award|archive-date=December 24, 2013}}</ref>

Woodward has authored or co-authored 18 nonfiction books in the past 35 years. All 18 have been national bestsellers and 12 of them have been No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers—more No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers than any contemporary author.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsb.com/speakers/bob-woodward/|title=Politics Speaker Bob Woodward {{!}} Acclaimed Journalist|website=National Speakers Bureau|language=en|access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref>

In his 1995 memoir, ''A Good Life,'' former ''Post'' Executive Editor [[Ben Bradlee]] singled out Woodward in the foreword. "It would be hard to overestimate the contributions to my newspaper and to my time as editor of that extraordinary reporter, Bob Woodward—surely the best of his generation at investigative reporting, the best I've ever seen.... And Woodward has maintained the same position on top of journalism's ladder ever since Watergate."<ref>Ben Bradlee, ''A Good Life,'' 1995, pp. 12–13, New York: Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|0-684-80894-3}}. See also pp. 324–384.</ref> In 1995, Woodward also received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#the-arts}}</ref>

[[David Gergen]], who had worked in the [[White House]] during the [[Richard Nixon]] and three subsequent administrations, said in his 2000 memoir, ''Eyewitness to Power'', of Woodward's reporting, "I don't accept everything he writes as gospel—he can get details wrong—but generally, his accounts in both his books and in the Post are remarkably reliable and demand serious attention. I am convinced he writes only what he believes to be true or has been reliably told to be true. And he is certainly a force for keeping the government honest."<ref>David Gergen, ''Eyewitness to Power'', 2000, p. 71, New York: Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|0-684-82663-1}}.</ref>

In 2001, Woodward won the [[Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Arizona State University|title=Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication|url=https://cronkite.asu.edu/about/walter-cronkite-and-asu/walter-cronkite-award|access-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref>

[[Fred Barnes (journalist)|Fred Barnes]] of the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' called Woodward "the best pure reporter of his generation, perhaps ever."<ref>Fred Barnes, "The White House at War," The Weekly Standard, December 12, 9002, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/001/945foufh.asp]</ref> In 2003, [[Albert Hunt]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called Woodward "the most celebrated journalist of our age." In 2004, [[Bob Schieffer]] of [[CBS News]] said, "Woodward has established himself as the best reporter of our time. He may be the best reporter of all time."<ref>Bob Schieffer, "The Best Reporter of All Time," CBS News, April 18, 2004, [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/19/opinion/schieffer/main612545.shtml]</ref>

In 2014, [[Robert Gates]] former director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], said that he wished he'd recruited Woodward into the CIA, saying, "He has an extraordinary ability to get otherwise responsible adults to spill [their] guts to him...his ability to get people to talk about stuff they shouldn't be talking about is just extraordinary and may be unique."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/01/gates-i-wanted-woodward-in-cia-181452|title=Gates: I wanted Woodward in CIA|last=Gold|first=Hadas|date=January 17, 2014|work=Politico|access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>

==Criticism==
===Style===
Woodward often uses unnamed sources in his reporting for the ''Post'' and in his books. Using extensive interviews with firsthand witnesses, documents, meeting notes, diaries, calendars, and other documentation, Woodward attempts to construct a seamless narrative of events, most often told through the eyes of the key participants.

[[Nicholas von Hoffman]] has made the criticism that "arrestingly irrelevant detail is [often] used",<ref>Nicholas von Hoffman, "Unasked Questions," The New York Review of Books, June 10, 1976, Vol. 23, Number 10.</ref> while [[Michael Massing]] believes Woodward's books are "filled with long, at times tedious passages with no evident direction."<ref>Michael Massing, "Sitting on Top of the News," The New York Review of Books, June 27, 1991, Vol. 38, Number 12.</ref>

[[Joan Didion]] published a comprehensive criticism of Woodward in a lengthy September 1996 essay in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.<ref>Joan Didion, "The Deferential Spirit," The New York Review of Books, September 19, 1996, Vol. 43, Number 14.</ref> Though "Woodward is a widely trusted reporter, even an American icon", she says that he assembles reams of often irrelevant detail, fails to draw conclusions, and make judgments. "Measurable cerebral activity is virtually absent" from his books after Watergate from 1979 to 1996, she said. She said the books are notable for "a scrupulous passivity, an agreement to cover the story not as it is occurring but as it is presented, which is to say as it is manufactured." She ridicules "fairness" as "a familiar newsroom piety, the excuse in practice for a good deal of autopilot reporting and lazy thinking." All this focus on what people said and thought—their "decent intentions"—circumscribes "possible discussion or speculation", resulting in what she called "political pornography".

The ''Post'''s Richard Harwood defended Woodward in a September 6, 1996, column, arguing that Woodward's method is that of a reporter—"talking to people you write about, checking and cross-checking their versions of contemporary history," and collecting documentary evidence in notes, letters, and records."<ref>Richard Harwood, "Deconstructing Bob Woodward," ''The Washington Post'', September 6, 1996, p. A23.</ref>

*Woodward has been accused of exaggeration and fabrication regarding "[[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]", his Watergate informant. After [[W. Mark Felt]] was announced as the true identity behind Deep Throat in 2005, [[John Dean]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dean/20050603.html |title=FindLaw's Writ – Dean: Why The Revelation of the Identity Of Deep Throat Has Only Created Another Mystery |publisher=Writ.news.findlaw.com |access-date=March 7, 2010}}</ref> and Ed Gray,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lpatrickgrayiii.com/watergate.html|title=Watergate and the FBI|work=lpatrickgrayiii.com}}</ref> in separate publications, used Woodward's book ''All The President's Men'' and his published notes on his meetings with Deep Throat to argue that Deep Throat could not have been only Mark Felt. They argued that Deep Throat was a fictional composite made up of several Woodward sources, only one of whom was Felt. Gray, in his book ''In Nixon's Web'', even went so far as to publish an e-mail and telephone exchange he had with [[Donald Santarelli]], a Washington lawyer who was a Justice Department official during Watergate, in which Santarelli confirmed to Gray that he was the source behind statements Woodward recorded in notes he has attributed to Deep Throat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lpatrickgrayiii.com/watergate03.html|title=Watergate and the FBI|work=lpatrickgrayiii.com}}</ref> However, Stephen Mielke, an archivist at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] who oversees the Woodward-Bernstein papers, said it is likely the page was misfiled under Felt because no source was identified. The original page of notes is in the [[Mark Felt]] file but "the carbon is located with the handwritten and typed notes attributed to Santarelli." Ed Gray said that Santarelli confirmed to him that he was the source behind the statements in the notes.<ref>Stephen Mielke (Archivist), finding aid in Woodward's handwritten and typed interview notes, 1972–73, in the Watergate Papers at the Harry Ransom Center, The University of Texas at Austin</ref>
*[[J.

*Writer Tanner Colby, who co-wrote a biography of [[John Belushi]] with the late actor's widow Judy, wrote in ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]'' that, while Woodward's frequently criticized 1984 book ''[[Wired (book)|Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi]]'' is largely accurate in its description of events, Woodward either gets the context wrong or does not find any context at all. For example, Belushi's grandmother's funeral, which led him to make a serious effort to sober up, gets merely a paragraph in Woodward's retelling, while a 24-hour drug binge in Los Angeles goes on for eight pages simply because the limo driver was willing to talk to Woodward. "It's like someone wrote a biography of Michael Jordan in which all the stats and scores are correct, but you come away with the impression that Michael Jordan wasn't very good at playing basketball," he concluded. Because it was unique among Woodward's books in that it made no use of confidential or anonymous sources, Colby was able to interview many of the same sources that Woodward had used, making comparisons of their recollection of events to Woodward's accounting of them relatively easy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mobile.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/03/bob_woodward_and_gene_sperling_what_woodward_s_john_belushi_book_can_tell.html |last=Colby |first=Tanner |title=Regrettable: The troubling things I learned when I re-reported Bob Woodward's book on John Belushi |work=[[Slate Magazine]] |date=March 12, 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
*Woodward believed the Bush administration's claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction before the war, and the publication of the book ''[[At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA]]'' by former Director of Central Intelligence [[George Tenet]] led Woodward to engage in a rather tortuous account of the extent of his pre-war conversations with Tenet in an article in ''The New Yorker'' in which he also chastised ''New York Times'' op-ed columnist [[Maureen Dowd]] for being critical of him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/05/21/070521fa_fact_goldberg?currentPage=3|title=Woodward vs. Tenet|author=Jeffrey Goldberg|date=May 21, 2007|work=The New Yorker}}</ref>

Commentator [[David Frum]] has said that Washington officials can learn something about the way Washington works from Woodward's books: "From his books, you can draw a composite profile of the powerful Washington player. That person is highly circumspect, highly risk averse, eschews new ideas, flatters his colleagues to their face (while trashing them to Woodward behind their backs), and is always careful to avoid career-threatening confrontation. We all admire heroes, but Woodward's books teach us that those who rise to leadership are precisely those who take care to abjure heroism for themselves."<ref>[http://frum.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjFiZmRmMjJmODA3Y2E1ZjE2MzllNDZhMGRhOTNkZTc=] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010185514/http://frum.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjFiZmRmMjJmODA3Y2E1ZjE2MzllNDZhMGRhOTNkZTc%3D |date=October 10, 2006}} Frum, David, "David Frum's Diary" blog, at the National Review Online Web site, October 5, 2006, post "Blogging Woodward"</ref>

Despite these criticisms and challenges, Woodward has been praised as an authoritative and balanced journalist. ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' said in 2004 that "No reporter has more talent for getting Washington's inside story and telling it cogently."<ref>{{cite news|last=Widmer|first=Ted|title='Plan of Attack': All the President's Mentors|work=The New York Times|date=April 28, 2004|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/28/books/review/0427books-woodward-widmer.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926015332/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/28/books/review/0427books-woodward-widmer.html|archive-date=September 26, 2010}}</ref>
