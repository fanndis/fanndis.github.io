'''North Miami Beach''' (commonly referred to as '''NMB''') is a city in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]], [[United States]]. Originally named Fulford-by-the-Sea in 1926 after Captain William H. Fulford of the [[United States Coast Guard]], the city was renamed North Miami Beach in 1931. The population was 41,523 at the 2010 census.

The [[1926 Miami hurricane|hurricane of 1926]] essentially ended the South Florida real estate boom, and in an effort to alleviate their losses and the damage to the city, local residents came together as the Town of Fulford. In 1927, the city was incorporated as the City of Fulford.<ref name="citynmb.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.citynmb.com/90th#%7B760A74AE-0CFB-4D3E-B816-4CCFA84D7423%7D|title=Our History – City of North Miami Beach, Florida|website=www.citynmb.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>

In 1959, The North Miami Beach Library was initially opened inside of a storefront on NE 163rd Street as a branch of the [[Miami-Dade Public Library System]] (then known as the City of Miami Library system). This location was relocated and expanded to two storefronts at the corner of NE 19th Avenue and NE 169th Street the following year.<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of NMB Library |url=https://www.citynmb.com/1048/The-History-of-NMB-Library |website=City of North Miami Beach |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> In 1961, however, the city ended its attachment with the City of Miami Library system and became an independent library. After residents of the City of North Miami Beach voted to build a permanent location for the library in 1964, a new building was constructed on 164th Street and opened in 1965. Renovations to this facility in 1981 and 1994 grew the branch from its original 10,000 square feet to make room for the library's expanding collection.

The NMB Library offers a variety of services to the residents of North Miami Beach, such as access to study and meeting rooms, employment resources, early literacy programs, voter registration forms, citizenship materials, and passport assistance. Computers, printers, copiers, scanners, and fax machine services are also available. The library's dedicated teen area, known as the Discovery District, is a space specifically designed to provide library patrons aged 13–19 with a place to read, study, or work on school projects.<ref>{{cite web |title=Discovery District |url=https://nmblib.weebly.com/d2-discovery-district.html |website=North Miami Beach Public Library |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> Access to computers, 3D printers, virtual reality, and zSpace for educational and recreational purposes is also provided.
