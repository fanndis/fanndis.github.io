The '''United States invasion of Grenada''' began at dawn on 25 October 1983. The U.S. and a coalition of six Caribbean nations invaded the island nation of [[Grenada]], {{convert|100|mi}} north of [[Venezuela]]. Codenamed '''Operation Urgent Fury''' by the U.S. military, it resulted in military occupation within a few days.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kukielski |first=Phil |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/09/08/how-grenada-reshaped-military/IZDvWwlt9Ed1chAJufkrvJ/story.html |title=How Grenada reshaped the US military|date=18 September 2013 |work=The Boston Globe|access-date=25 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was triggered by the strife within the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Government]] which resulted in the house arrest and execution of the previous leader and second Prime Minister of Grenada [[Maurice Bishop]], and the establishment of the Revolutionary Military Council with [[Hudson Austin]] as Chairman. The invasion resulted in the appointment of an interim government, followed by democratic elections in 1984. The country has remained a democratic nation since then.

Grenada had gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1974. The Communist [[New Jewel Movement]] seized power in a coup in 1979 under Maurice Bishop, suspending the constitution and detaining several political prisoners. In September 1983, an internal power struggle began over Bishop's leadership performance.<ref>{{Cite book |editor1-last=Seabury |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=McDougall |editor2-first=Walter A. |date=1984 |title=The Grenada Papers |url=https://archive.org/details/grenadapapers00ssou |location=San Francisco |oclc=11233840 |publisher=Institute for Contemporary Studies |isbn=0-917616-68-5 |url-access=registration}}</ref> Bishop was pressured at a party meeting to share power with Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard. Bishop initially agreed, but later balked. He was put under house arrest by his own party's Central Committee until he relented. When his secret detention became widely known, Bishop was freed by an aroused crowd of his supporters. A confrontation then ensued at military headquarters between Grenadian soldiers loyal to Coard and civilians supporting Bishop. Shooting started under still-disputed circumstances. At least 19 soldiers and civilians were killed on 19 October 1983 including Bishop, his partner [[Jacqueline Creft]], two other cabinet ministers and two union leaders. 

The [[Reagan administration]] in the U.S. launched a military intervention following receipt of a formal appeal for help from the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]]. In addition, the [[Governor-General of Grenada]] [[Paul Scoon]] secretly signaled he would also support outside intervention, but he put off signing a letter of invitation until 26 October.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Scoon, Sir Paul |date=2003 |title= Survival for Service: My Experiences as Governor General of Grenada |location=Oxford |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean |isbn=0-333-97064-0 |oclc=54489557 |pages=136 and 145}}</ref> Reagan also acted due to "concerns over the 600 U.S. medical students on the island" and fears of a repeat of the [[Iran hostage crisis]].

The invasion began on the morning of 25 October 1983, just two days after the bombing of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut]]. The invading force consisted of the US Army’s 1st and 2nd battalions of the 75th Ranger Regiment, the 82nd Airborne and the Army’s [[rapid deployment force]], Marines, Army Delta Force, Navy SEALs, and ancillary forces totaling 7,600 troops, together with Jamaican forces and troops of the [[Regional Security System]] (RSS).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-3377.html |title=Caribbean Islands – A Regional Security System |publisher=country-data.com}}</ref> The force defeated Grenadian resistance after a low-altitude airborne assault by Rangers and the 82nd Airborne on [[Maurice Bishop International Airport|Point Salines Airport]] at the south end of the island, and a Marine helicopter and amphibious landing on the north end at [[Pearls Airport]]. Austin's military government was deposed and replaced, with Scoon as Governor-General, by an interim advisory council until the 1984 elections.

The invasion was criticized by many countries, including Canada. British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] privately disapproved of the mission and the lack of notice that she received, but she publicly supported it.<ref>Moore, Charles (2016). ''Margaret Thatcher: At her Zenith''. p. 130.</ref> The United Nations General Assembly condemned it as "a flagrant violation of international law" on 2 November 1983 with a vote of 108 to 9.<ref name=UN_GA_Resolution_38_7>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/38/7|title=United Nations General Assembly resolution 38/7 |publisher=United Nations |date= 2 November 1983 | access-date =5 March 2016}}</ref> Conversely, there was broad public support in the United States.<ref name=Magnuson>{{cite news| last=Magnuson |first=Ed |title=Getting Back to Normal |magazine=Time |date=21 November 1983 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926318-1,00.html}}</ref><ref name="AP 2012">{{cite web |title=Grenada Trying to Find Remains of Slain Marxist PM |date=20 November 2014 |orig-year=8 June 2012 |publisher=[[Fox News]] |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/06/08/grenada-trying-to-find-remains-slain-marxist-pm.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=30 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Steven F.

The date of the invasion is now a national holiday in Grenada called [[Thanksgiving Day#Grenada|Thanksgiving Day]], commemorating the freeing of several political prisoners who were subsequently elected to office. A [[History of Grenada#Truth and reconciliation commission|truth and reconciliation commission]] was launched in 2000 to re-examine some of the controversies of the era; in particular, the commission made an unsuccessful attempt to find Bishop's body, which had been disposed of at Austin's order and never found. The invasion also highlighted issues with communication and coordination between the different branches of the American military when operating together as a joint force, contributing to investigations and sweeping changes in the form of the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]] and other reorganizations.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Kukielski |first=Philip |year=2019 |title=The U.S. Invasion of Grenada: legacy of a flawed victory |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland & Company |isbn=978-1-4766-7879-5 |oclc=1123182247 |pages=213–214}}</ref>

Sir [[Eric Gairy]] had led Grenada to independence from the United Kingdom in 1974, but his term in office coincided with civil strife in Grenada. He was head of the [[Grenada United Labour Party]] and claimed victory in the general election of 1976, but the opposition did not accept the result as legitimate.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/revolutionrescue0000burr|title=Revolution and rescue in Grenada : an account of the U.S.-Caribbean invasion|last=Burrowes, Reynold A.|date=1988|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-26066-4|location=New York|oclc=17943224|url-access=registration}}</ref> The civil strife took the form of street violence between Gairy's private army the [[Mongoose Gang]], and gangs organized by the [[New Jewel Movement]] (NJM).

=== Airport ===
The Bishop government began constructing the [[Maurice Bishop International Airport|Point Salines International Airport]] with the help of Britain, Cuba, Libya, Algeria, and other nations. The British government proposed the airport in 1954 when Grenada was still a British colony. Canadians designed it, the British government underwrote it, and a London firm built it. The American government accused Grenada of constructing facilities to aid a Soviet-Cuban military buildup in the Caribbean based on the {{convert|9000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway which could accommodate the largest Soviet aircraft, such as the [[An-12]], [[An-22]], and the [[An-124]]. Such a facility would enhance the Soviet and Cuban transportation of weapons to Central American insurgents and expand Soviet regional influence. Bishop's government claimed that the airport was built to accommodate commercial aircraft carrying tourists, pointing out that such jets could not land at Pearls Airport on the island's north end (5,200 feet), and that Pearls could not be expanded because its runway abutted a mountain at one end and the ocean at the other.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/grenadarevolutio0000payn/page/31|title=Grenada : revolution and invasion|last=Payne, Anthony, 1952-|date=1984|publisher=St. Martin's Press|others=Sutton, Paul K., Thorndike, Tony.|isbn=0-312-35042-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/grenadarevolutio0000payn/page/31 31]|oclc=10548141}}</ref>

In 1983, Representative [[Ron Dellums]] (D, California) traveled to Grenada on a fact-finding mission, having been invited by the country's prime minister. He described his findings before Congress:

<blockquote>Based on my personal observations, discussion, and analysis of the new international airport under construction in Grenada, it is my conclusion that this project is specifically now and has always been for the purpose of economic development and is not for military use…. It is my thought that it is absurd, patronizing, and totally unwarranted for the United States government to charge that this airport poses a military threat to the United States' national security.<ref name="commentary">{{cite magazine|title=Another "Low Dishonest Decade" on the Left|date=January 1987|magazine=Commentary|author=Peter Collier, [[David Horowitz]]}}</ref></blockquote>

In March 1983, President Reagan began issuing warnings about the threat posed to the United States and the Caribbean by the Soviet-Cuban militarization of the Caribbean, evident from the excessively long airplane runway being built and intelligence indicating increased Soviet interest in the island. He said that the runway and the numerous fuel storage tanks were unnecessary for commercial flights, and that evidence indicated that the airport was to become a Cuban-Soviet forward military airbase.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C12F6385D0C758EDDAA0894DB484D81&scp=20&sq=grenada&st=nyt|title=Grenada|last=Gailey|first=Phil|date=26 March 1983|work=New York Times|author2=Warren Weaver Jr.|accessdate=11 March 2008}}</ref>

=== October 1983 ===
On 16 October 1983, Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]] seized power and placed Bishop under house arrest. There were mass protests against this which led to Bishop escaping detention and reasserting his authority as the head of the government. He was eventually captured and murdered by a firing squad of soldiers, along with his partner and several government officials and union leaders who were loyal to him. The army under [[Hudson Austin]] then stepped in and formed a military council to rule the country, and they placed Governor-General [[Paul Scoon]] under house arrest. The army announced a four-day total curfew where anyone seen on the streets would be summarily executed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The main objectives on the first day were for the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] to capture the [[Point Salines International Airport]] in order for the [[82nd Airborne Division]] to land reinforcements on the island; the [[8th Marine Regiment]] to capture [[Pearls Airport]]; and other forces to rescue the American students at the True Blue Campus of [[St. George's University]]. In addition, a number of special operations missions were undertaken by Army Delta Force operatives and Navy SEALs to obtain intelligence and secure key individuals and equipment. Many of these missions were plagued by inadequate intelligence, planning, and accurate maps of any kind, and the American forces mostly relied upon tourist maps.

===Navy SEAL reconnaissance missions===
[[File:Grenada Invasion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Map of invasion plan]]

U.S. Special Operations Forces were deployed to Grenada beginning on 23 October, before 25 October invasion. Navy SEALs from [[SEAL Team Six]] with Air Force combat controllers were airdropped at sea to perform a reconnaissance mission on Point Salines. Four SEALs were lost at sea, and their bodies were never recovered causing most people to suspect that the four SEALs had drowned.<ref name=":0" /> The four SEALs that were believed to have drowned were Machinist Mate 1st Class Kenneth J. Butcher, Quartermaster 1st Class Kevin E. Lundberg, Hull Technician 1st Class Stephen L. Morris, and Senior Chief Engineman Robert R. Schamberger. In an interview conducted by Bill Salisbury and published on October 4, 1990, Kenneth Butcher's widow claimed that she had gone to Grenada hoping that her husband had survived. She said, "There was this fisherman who said he saw four guys in wetsuits come out of the water, and then two days later he saw four bodies being thrown into the water. So we would like to think they made it, ’cause there was a boat smashed up on the beach. We would like to think the four of them got in that boat, made it to shore, got someplace, and were captured. And they’re, you know, gonna come back." <ref>https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/1990/oct/04/you-know-ken/</ref> The survivors continued their mission, but their boats flooded while evading a patrol boat, causing the mission to be aborted. Another SEAL mission was unsuccessful on 24 October also due to harsh weather, resulting in little intelligence being gathered in advance of the impending intervention.<ref name="Navy SEAL Museum">{{cite web|title=SEAL History: Navy SEALs in Grenada Operation URGENT FURY|url=https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-navy-seals-in-grenada|publisher=Navy SEAL Museum|accessdate=6 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316041137/https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-navy-seals-in-grenada|archive-date=16 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Air assault on Point Salines ===
A and B companies of the 1st Battalion of the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] embarked on [[C-130]]s at [[Hunter Army Airfield]] at midnight on 24 October to perform an air assault landing on Point Salines International Airport, intending to land at the airport and then disembark. But the Rangers had to switch abruptly to a parachute landing when they learned mid-flight that the runway was obstructed. The air drop began at 05:30 on 25 October in the face of moderate resistance from [[ZU-23]] anti-aircraft guns and several BTR-60 APCs, which were knocked out by [[M67 recoilless rifle]] fire. [[AC-130]] gunships provided support for the landing. Cuban construction vehicles were commandeered to help clear the airfield, and one was even used to provide mobile cover for the Rangers as they moved to seize the heights surrounding the airfield.<ref name=Stuart>{{cite book|last1=Stuart|first1=Richard W.|title=Operation Urgent Fury: The Invasion of Grenada, October 1983|date=2008|publisher=U.S. Army|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/grenada/urgent_fury.pdf}}</ref>

They cleared the airstrip of obstructions by 10 AM, and transport planes were able to land and unload additional reinforcements, including [[M151]] Jeeps and members of the [[Caribbean Peace Force]] who were assigned to guard the perimeter and detainees. Starting at 14:00, units began landing at Point Salines from the [[82nd Airborne Division]] under [[Edward Trobaugh]], including battalions of the [[325th Infantry Regiment]]. At 15:30, three BTR-60s of the Grenadian Army Motorized Company counter-attacked, but the Americans repelled them with recoilless rifles and an AC-130.<ref name=CombatReform>{{cite web|title=Turning the Tide: Operation Urgent Fury|url=http://www.combatreform.org/grenada.htm|website=Combat Reform|accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref>

The Rangers fanned out and secured the surrounding area, including negotiating the surrender of more than 100 Cubans in an aviation hangar. However, a Jeep-mounted Ranger patrol became lost searching for [[Saint George's University|True Blue Campus]] and was ambushed, with four killed. The Rangers eventually secured True Blue campus and its students, where they found only 140 students and were told that more were at another campus in Grand Anse. In all, the Rangers lost five men on the first day, but succeeded in securing Point Salines and the surrounding area.<ref name=Stuart />

===Capture of Pearls Airport===
A platoon of Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 4 under Lieutenant Mike Walsh approached the beach near [[Pearls Airport]] around midnight on 24 October after evading patrol boats and overcoming stormy weather. They found that the beach was lightly defended but unsuitable for an amphibious landing. The 2nd Battalion of the [[8th Marine Regiment]] then landed south of Pearls Airport using [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46 Sea Knight]] and [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] helicopters at 05:30 on 25 October; they captured Pearls Airport, encountering only light resistance, including a [[DShK]] machine gun which a Marine [[AH-1 Cobra]] destroyed.<ref name=Kreisher>{{cite web|last1=Kreisher|first1=Otto|title=Operation URGENT FURY – Grenada|url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/operation-urgent-fury-grenada|publisher=Marine Corps Association & Foundation}}</ref>

===Raid on Radio Free Grenada===
[[UH-60 Blackhawk]] helicopters delivered [[SEAL Team 6]] operators in the early morning of 25 October to Radio Free Grenada with the purpose of using the radio station for [[PsyOps|psychological operations]]. They captured the station unopposed and destroyed the radio transmitter. However, they were attacked by Grenadian forces in cars and an armored personnel carrier (APC), which forced the lightly armed SEALs to cut a fence and retreat into the ocean as they received fire from the APC. The SEALs swam to [[USS Caron|USS ''Caron'']].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://public2.nhhcaws.local/content/history/nhhc/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/c/caron--dd-970-.html|title=Caron (DD-970)|website=public2.nhhcaws.local|language=en-US|access-date=26 December 2019}}</ref>

===Raids on Fort Rupert and Richmond Hill Prison===
On 25 October, [[Delta Force]] and C Company of the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] embarked in MH-60 and [[MH-6 Little Bird]] helicopters of [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment|Task Force 160]] to capture Fort Rupert, where they believed the Revolutionary Council leaders lived, and Richmond Hill Prison, where political prisoners were being held. The raid on Richmond Hill Prison lacked vital intelligence, including the fact that several anti-aircraft guns defended it, and that the prison was on a steep hill without room for a helicopter to land. Anti-aircraft fire wounded passengers and crew and forced one MH-60 helicopter to crash land, causing another helicopter to land next to it to protect the survivors. One pilot was killed, and the Delta Force operators had to be relieved by a Navy Sea King helicopter.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The U.S. Invasion of Grenada : legacy of a flawed victory|last=Kukielski|first=Philip|publisher=McFarland & Company|year=2019|isbn=978-1-4766-7879-5|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=66–68|oclc=1123182247}}</ref> The raid on Fort Rupert, however, was successful in capturing several leaders of the People's Revolutionary Government.<ref name="CombatReform"/>

===Mission to rescue Governor General Scoon===
[[File:AH-1S firing cannon Grenada 1983.JPEG|thumb|A U.S. Army AH-1S Cobra attack helicopter opens fire on an enemy position]]

The last major special operation was a mission to rescue Governor General Scoon from his mansion in [[Saint George, Grenada]]. The mission departed late at 05:30 on 25 October from Barbados, resulting in the Grenadian forces being already aware of the invasion and they guarded Scoon closely. The SEAL team entered the mansion without opposition, but [[BTR-60]] armored personnel carriers counter-attacked and trapped the SEALs and the governor inside. [[AC-130]] gunships, [[A-7 Corsair]] strike planes, and [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack helicopters were called in to support the besieged SEALs, but the SEALs remained trapped for the next 24 hours.

At 19:00 on 25 October 250 Marines from G Company of the [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd Marine Assault Unit]] landed at Grand Mal Bay equipped with [[Assault Amphibious Vehicle|amphibious assault vehicles]] and four [[M60 Patton]] tanks; they relieved the Navy SEALs the following morning, allowing Governor Scoon, his wife, and nine aides to be safely evacuated at 10:00 that day. The Marine tank crews continued advancing in the face of sporadic resistance, knocking out a BRDM-2 armored car.<ref name="Russell" /> G Company subsequently defeated and overwhelmed the Grenadian defenders at Fort Frederick.<ref name="Kreisher" />

=== Airstrikes ===
Navy [[A-7 Corsair]]s and Marine [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack helicopters made airstrikes against Fort Rupert and Fort Frederick. An A-7 raid on Fort Frederick targeting anti-aircraft guns hit a nearby mental hospital, killing 18 civilians.<ref name="dtic" />{{rp|62}} Two Marine AH-1T Cobras and a UH-60 Blackhawk were shot down in a raid against Fort Frederick, resulting in five casualties.<ref name="Kreisher" />

==Second day of the invasion==
[[File:Op Urgent Fury Invasion Map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Initial troop invasion areas]]

General Trobaugh of the 82nd Airborne Division had two goals on the second day: securing the perimeter around Salines Airport, and rescuing American students held in Grand Anse. The Army lacked undamaged helicopters after the losses on the first day and consequently had to delay the student rescue until they made contact with Marine forces.

===Attack on the Cuban compound===
Early on the morning of 26 October, Cuban forces ambushed a patrol from the 2nd Battalion of the 325th Infantry Regiment near the village of Calliste. The American patrol suffered six wounded and two killed, including the commander of Company B. Navy airstrikes and an artillery bombardment by [[M102 howitzer|105mm howitzers]] targeting the main Cuban encampment eventually led to their surrender at 08:30. American forces pushed on to the village of Frequente, where they discovered a Cuban weapons cache reportedly sufficient to equip six battalions. Cuban forces ambushed a reconnaissance platoon who were mounted on gun-jeeps, but the jeeps returned fire, and a nearby infantry unit added mortar fire; the Cubans suffered four casualties with no American losses. Cuban resistance largely ended after these engagements.<ref name="Stuart" />

===Rescue at Grand Anse===
On the afternoon of 26 October, Rangers of the 2nd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment mounted Marine [[CH-46 Sea Knight]] helicopters to launch an air assault on the Grand Anse campus. The campus police offered light resistance before fleeing, wounding one Ranger, and one of the helicopters crashed on the approach after its blade hit a palm tree. The Rangers evacuated the 233 American students by [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] helicopters, but the students informed them that there was a third campus with Americans at Prickly Bay.<ref name="Kreisher" /> A squad of 11 Rangers was accidentally left behind; they departed on a rubber raft which was picked up by {{USS|Caron}} at 23:00.<ref name="CombatReform" />

==Third day of the invasion and after==
[[File:Explosion2 during Grenada invasion 1983.JPEG|thumb|Bombardment of Point Calivigny]]

By 27 October, organized resistance was rapidly diminishing, but the American forces did not yet realize this. The Marine 22nd MAU and 8th Regiment continued advancing along the coast and capturing additional towns, meeting little resistance, although one patrol did encounter a single [[BTR-60]] during the night and dispatched it with a [[M72 LAW]]. The 325th Infantry Regiment advanced toward Saint George, capturing Grand Anse and discovering 200 American students whom they had missed the first day. They continued to the town of Ruth Howard and the capital of Saint George, meeting only scattered resistance. An air-naval gunfire liaison team called in an A-7 airstrike and accidentally hit the command post of the 2nd Brigade, wounding 17 troops, one of whom died.<ref name="Stuart" />

The Army had reports that PRA forces were amassing at the Calivigny Barracks, only five kilometers from the Point Salines airfield. They organized an air assault by the 2nd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment preceded by a preparatory bombardment by field howitzers (which mostly missed, their shells falling into the ocean), [[A-7 Corsair]]s, [[AC-130]]s, and USS ''Caron''. However, the [[UH-60 Blackhawk|Blackhawk]] helicopters began dropping off troops near the barracks but they approached too fast. One of them crash-landed and the two behind it collided with it, killing three and wounding four. The barracks were deserted.<ref name="CombatReform" />

In the following days, resistance ended entirely and the Army and Marines spread across the island, arresting PRA officials, seizing caches of weapons, and seeing to the repatriation of Cuban engineers. On 1 November, two companies from the 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit made a combined sea and helicopter landing on the island of [[Carriacou]] {{convert|17|mi}} northeast of Grenada. The 19 Grenadian soldiers defending the island surrendered without a fight. This was the last military action of the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/operation-urgent-fury-grenada |title=Operation URGENT FURY – Grenada |last=Kreisher |first=Otto |date=October 2003 |website=Marine Corps Association and Foundation | accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref>

==Outcome==
[[File:CH46SeaKnight Grenada 1983.JPG|thumb|A Marine Corps [[Sea Knight]] helicopter sits on the beach after being disabled during the Grand Anse rescue on 26 October 1983]]
Official U.S. sources state that some of the opponents were well prepared and well positioned and put up stubborn resistance, to the extent that the Americans called in two battalions of reinforcements on the evening of 26 October. The total naval and air superiority of the American forces had overwhelmed the defenders. Nearly 8,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines had participated in Operation Urgent Fury along with 353 Caribbean allies of the [[Caribbean Peace Force]]s. American forces sustained 19 killed and 116 wounded; Cuban forces sustained 25 killed, 59 wounded, and 638 combatants captured. Grenadian forces suffered 45 dead and 358 wounded; at least 24 civilians were also killed, 18 of whom died in the accidental bombing of a Grenadian mental hospital.<ref name=dtic/>{{rp|62}} The Americans also destroyed a significant amount of Grenada's military hardware, including six APCs and an armored car.<ref name="Russell"/> A second armored car was impounded and shipped back to [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]] for inspection.<ref name="BRDM">''[https://web.archive.org/web/20160812115858/http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/Fortitudine%20Vol%2015%20No%204_2.pdf Fortitudine: Newsletter of the Marine Corps Historical Program, Volumes 15–18]''.

==Legality of the invasion==
The US government defended its invasion of Grenada as an action to protect American citizens living on the island, including medical students. Deputy Secretary of State Kenneth W. Dam said that action was necessary to "resolve" what Article 28 of the charter of the [[Organization of American States]] (O.A.S.) refers to as "a 'situation that might endanger the peace'". He added that the OAS charter and the UN charter both "recognize the competence of regional security bodies in ensuring regional peace and stability,"<ref>New York Times, 15 November 1983, [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/15/world/us-defending-grenada-action-before-oas.html U.S. Defending Grenada Action Before O.A.S.]</ref> referring to the decision by the [[Organization of Eastern Caribbean States]] to approve the invasion.

The UN Charter prohibits the use of force by member states except in cases of self-defense or when specifically authorized by the [[UN Security Council]]. The UN Security Council had not authorized invasion.<ref>John M. Karas and Jerald M. Goodman, "The United States Action in Grenada: An Exercise in Real Politik", 16 U. Miami Inter-Am. L.

==Reaction in the United States==
[[File:Citizens of Grenada-US leaflet.jpg|thumb|Leaflet distributed during the invasion by 9th PSYOP Bn]]
''Time'' magazine described the invasion as having "broad popular support." A congressional study group concluded that the invasion had been justified, as most members felt that American students at the university near a contested runway could have been taken hostage as [[Iran hostage crisis|American diplomats in Iran]] had been four years previously. The group's report caused House Speaker [[Tip O'Neill]] to change his position on the issue from opposition to support.<ref name=Magnuson/>

[[File:M102 howitzers during Operation Urgent Fury.jpg|thumb|right|M102 howitzers of 1st Bn 320th FA, 82D Abn Div firing during battle]]

However, some members of the study group dissented from its findings. Congressman [[Louis Stokes]] (D, Ohio) stated: "Not a single American child nor single American national was in any way placed in danger or placed in a hostage situation prior to the invasion."  The [[Congressional Black Caucus]] denounced the invasion, and seven Democratic congressmen introduced an unsuccessful resolution to impeach President Reagan, led by [[Ted Weiss]].<ref name=Magnuson/>

Medical students in Grenada speaking to [[Ted Koppel]] on 25 October 1983 edition of his newscast ''[[Nightline]]'' stated that they were safe and did not feel that their lives were in danger. Medical students told Koppel the next evening how grateful they were for the invasion and the Army Rangers, which probably saved their lives. State Department officials had assured the medical students that they would be able to complete their medical school education in the United States.<ref>[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=656934 Nightline – 25 Oct 1983 – ABC – TV news: Vanderbilt Television News Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/diglib-fulldisplay.pl?SID=20100809760314941&code=tvn&RC=656937&Row=341 Television News Archive: Nightline<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==International reaction==
The United Nations General Assembly adopted General Assembly Resolution 38/7 on 2 November 1983 by a vote of 108 to 9 which "deeply deplores the armed intervention in Grenada, which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that State."<ref name=UN_GA_Resolution_38_7 /> It went on to deplore "the death of innocent civilians" and the "killing of the Prime Minister and other prominent Grenadians", and it called for an "immediate cessation of the armed intervention" and demanded, "that free elections be organized".

This was the first military restoration of a Communist nation to its former governance. The Soviet Union said that Grenada had been the object of United States threats, that the invasion violated international law, and that no small nation would find itself safe if the aggression were not rebuffed. The governments of some countries stated that the United States intervention was a return to the era of barbarism. The governments of other countries said the United States had violated several treaties and conventions to which it was a party.<ref>''United Nations Yearbook'', Volume 37, 1983, Department of Public Information, United Nations, New York</ref> A similar resolution was discussed in the [[United Nations Security Council]] but it was ultimately vetoed by the United States.<ref name=Zunes/><ref name=Spartacus>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/COLDgrenada.htm |title=Spartacus Educational |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629064517/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/COLDgrenada.htm |archivedate=29 June 2008  }}</ref><ref name="un veto"/>

President [[Ronald Reagan]] was asked if he was concerned by the lopsided 108–9 vote in the UN General Assembly. He said, "it didn't upset my breakfast at all."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19831104&id=uDcSAAAAIBAJ&pg=5592,2048008 |title=Reagan: Vote loss in U.N.

Grenada is part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and it requested help from other Commonwealth members. The intervention was opposed by Commonwealth members including the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, and Canada.<ref name=dtic/>{{rp|50}} British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], a close ally of Reagan on other matters, personally opposed it. Reagan told her that it might happen; she did not know for sure that it was coming until three hours before. At 12:30 on the morning of the invasion, Thatcher sent a message to Reagan:

{{quote|This action will be seen as intervention by a Western country in the internal affairs of a small independent nation, however unattractive its regime. I ask you to consider this in the context of our wider East/West relations and of the fact that we will be having in the next few days to present to our Parliament and people the siting of [[Cruise missile]]s in this country.

The American and Caribbean governments quickly reaffirmed Scoon as Queen Elizabeth's sole legitimate representative in Grenada, and hence the only lawful authority on the island. In accordance with Commonwealth constitutional practice, Scoon assumed power as interim head of government and formed an advisory council which named [[Nicholas Brathwaite]] as chairman pending new elections.<ref name=z9f6WdltuE/><ref name=NYTObit/> The [[Grenada National Party]] won the elections in December 1984 and formed a government led by Prime Minister [[Herbert Blaize]].

American forces remained in Grenada after combat operations finished in December as part of Operation Island Breeze. Elements remaining performed security missions and assisted members of the Caribbean Peacekeeping Force and the Royal Grenadian Police Force, including military police, special forces, and a specialized intelligence detachment.<!--<ref name=Sundin/> --> The [[Point Salines International Airport]] was renamed in honor of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop on 29 May 2009, his 65th birthday.<ref name="airport_rename1" /><ref name="airport_rename2" /> Hundreds of Grenadians turned out to commemorate the event.

===United States===

The invasion showed problems with the American "information apparatus," which ''Time'' magazine described as still being in "some disarray" three weeks after the invasion.<!--<ref name=Magnuson/> -->  For example, the State Department falsely claimed that a mass grave had been discovered which held 100 bodies of islanders who had been killed by communist forces.<ref name=Magnuson/> Major General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]], deputy commander of the invasion force, said that 160 Grenadian soldiers and 71 Cubans had been killed during the invasion; the Pentagon had given a count of 59 Cuban and Grenadian deaths.<ref name=Magnuson/> Ronald H. Cole's report for the Joint Chiefs of Staff showed an even lower count.<ref name=dtic/>

Also of concern were the problems that the invasion showed with the military. There was a lack of intelligence about Grenada which exacerbated the difficulties faced by the quickly assembled invasion force.<!--<ref name=Magnuson/> --> For example, they did not know that the students were actually at two different campuses, and there was a 30-hour delay in reaching students at the second campus.<ref name=Magnuson/> Maps provided to soldiers on the ground were tourist maps on which [[Military Grid Reference System|military grid reference lines]] were drawn by hand to report locations of units and request artillery and aircraft fire support. They also did not show topography and were not marked with crucial positions. Navy ships providing naval gunfire and Marine, Air Force, and Navy fighter-bomber support aircraft providing close air support mistakenly killed American ground forces due to differences in charts and location coordinates, data, and methods of calling for fire support. Communications between services were also not compatible and hindered the coordination of operations.

The Department of Defense recognized a need for improved communications and coordination among the branches of the American military. Congress investigated many of the problems and passed the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]] of 1986 (Pub. L.99–433).<ref name=":0" /> This act reworked the command structure of the military, making the most sweeping changes to the Department of Defense since the department was established in the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. It increased the power of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and advanced the concept of unified joint forces organized under one command.

25 October is a national holiday in Grenada, called Thanksgiving Day, to commemorate the invasion. [[St. George's University]] (SGU) built a monument on its True Blue campus to honor the American servicemen killed during the invasion, and marks the day with an annual memorial ceremony.
