==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 800 words. -->
An enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman arrives at a castle during a ball and offers the host, a cruel and selfish prince, a rose in return for shelter from a storm. When he refuses, she reveals her identity. As punishment for the prince's lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects, then erases the castle, himself, and his servants from the memories of their loved ones and everyone else in the town. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the spell will only be broken if he learns to love another, and be loved in return before the last petal falls, or he will remain a beast forever.

Some years later, in the small town of Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of an inventor named Maurice, dreams of adventure. She constantly brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant former soldier, as he is not the type of man Belle wishes to marry. On Maurice's way to a convention and lost in the forest, he seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose from his garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search of him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. Belle tricks both her father and the Beast by asking for a simple hug goodbye from her father, she pushes him out and locks herself in the dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take her father's place and forces Maurice to leave immediately.

Belle befriends the castle's servants; candelabra footman Lumiere, clock majordomo Cogsworth, feather-duster maid Plumette, teapot housekeeper Mrs. Potts, and her teacup son Chip. They invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. Belle is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, becoming injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a spark develops between them. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a [[Plague doctor costume|plague doctor's mask]] and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].

In Villeneuve, Maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment. Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice. When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. Maurice is rescued by the town hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence, Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.

After sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. At Villeneuve, Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic and has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he curses the whole village. Inside the asylum carriage, Belle tells her father that she knows what happened to her mother and showed him the rose rattle she took from her magical visit to their old, abandoned home. Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.

During the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. He attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston, but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston treacherously shoots the Beast from a bridge, which then collapses as the castle begins to crumble, leading Gaston to fall to his death. The Beast then dies as the last petal falls, and the servants become inanimate.

As Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the spell, repairing the crumbling castle, restoring the Beast and servants to their human forms and to the villagers' memories. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.

By April 2014, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] had already begun developing a new [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action version]] of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' after making other live-action fantasy films such as ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]'', ''[[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|Cinderella]]'', and ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chitwood|first1=Adam|title=Rumor: Could Bill Condon Direct Disney's Live-Action BEAUTY AND THE BEAST?|url=https://collider.com/beauty-and-the-beast-bill-condon/|accessdate=May 20, 2015|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=April 11, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150524013704/http://collider.com/beauty-and-the-beast-bill-condon/|archive-date=May 24, 2015}}</ref> Two months later, [[Bill Condon]] signed on to direct the film from a script by [[Evan Spiliotopoulos]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Bill Condon to Direct Live-Action 'Beauty and the Beast' Film for Disney|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/bill-condon-beauty-and-the-beast-disney-1201151834/|accessdate=January 27, 2015|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 4, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206212052/http://variety.com/2014/film/news/bill-condon-beauty-and-the-beast-disney-1201151834/|archive-date=February 6, 2015}}</ref> Later in September of that same year, [[Stephen Chbosky]] (who directed [[Emma Watson]] in ''[[The Perks of Being a Wallflower (film)|The Perks of Being a Wallflower]]'') was hired to re-write the script.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Sperling |first=Nicole |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/09/29/perks-of-being-a-wallflower-stephen-chbosky-beauty-and-the-beast/ |title='Perks of Being a Wallflower' author will adapt 'Beauty and the Beast' |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=September 29, 2014 |accessdate=September 30, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001025146/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/09/29/perks-of-being-a-wallflower-stephen-chbosky-beauty-and-the-beast/ |archive-date=October 1, 2014  }}</ref>

Before Condon was hired to direct the film, Disney approached him with a proposal to remake the film in a more radical way as [[Universal Studios]] had remade ''[[Snow White and the Huntsman]]'' (2012). Condon later explained that "after ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' opened, the studio saw that there was this big international audience for an old-school-musical approach. But initially, they said, 'We're interested in a musical to a degree, but only half full of songs.' My interest was taking that film and doing it in this new medium—live-action—as a full-on musical movie. So I backed out for a minute, and they came back and said, 'No, no, no, we get it, let's pursue it that way.{{'"}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kilday|first1=Gregg|title='Beauty and the Beast' Director on How 'La La Land' Is Bringing Musicals Back|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/beauty-beast-director-bill-condon-bringing-musicals-back-981418|accessdate=April 3, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=March 2, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303020143/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/beauty-beast-director-bill-condon-bringing-musicals-back-981418|archive-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref> Walt Disney Pictures President of Production [[Sean Bailey]] credited [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] chairman [[Alan F.

The Beast was portrayed with a "more traditional motion capture puppeteering for the body and the physical orientation", where actor Dan Stevens was "in a forty-pound gray suit on stilts for much of the film". The facial capture for the Beast was done separately in order to "communicate the subtleties of the human face" and "[capture the] thought that occurs to him" which gets "through [to] the eyes, which are the last human element in the Beast." The castle servants who are transformed into household objects were created with [[computer animation|CGI animation]].<ref name="Penske Business Media"/>

Before the release of the film, Bill Condon refilmed one certain sequence in the "Days of the Sun" number, due to confusion among test audiences caused by actress Harriet Jones, who looked similar to [[Hattie Morahan]], who portrayed Agathe. In the original version of the scene, it was Jones's character, the Prince's mother, who sings the first verse of the song, with Rudi Goodman playing the young Prince and [[Henry Garrett (actor)|Henry Garrett]] playing his father; but in the reshot version of the scene, the singing part is given to the Prince (now played by Adam Mitchell). The King was also recast to Tom Turner, although Harriet Jones was still the Queen, albeit with dark hair. Both Goodman and Garrett's names were mistakenly featured in the original theatrical release's credits, but was later corrected in home releases.<ref name="OriginalDaysInTheSun"/>

When released in 1991, ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' marked a turning point for [[Walt Disney Pictures]] by appealing to millions of fans with its Oscar-winning musical score by lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] and composer [[Alan Menken]]. In [[Bill Condon]]'s opinion, that original score was the key reason he agreed to direct a live-action version of the movie. "That score had more to reveal", he says, "You look at the songs and there's not a clunker in the group. In fact, [[Frank Rich]] described it as the best Broadway musical of 1991. The animated version was already darker and more modern than the previous Disney fairy-tales.

On January 19, 2017, both Disney and [[Céline Dion]] — singer of the original 1991 "[[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|Beauty and the Beast]]" duet song, with singer [[Peabo Bryson]] — confirmed that Dion would be performing one of the new original songs "[[How Does a Moment Last Forever]]" to play over the end titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.com/music/celine-dion-beauty-and-the-beast-soundtrack-song/ |title=Céline Dion Set to Perform New Song for Live-Action Beauty and the Beast Soundtrack |work=People |department=Music |date=January 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 26, 2017 |author=Tracy, Brianne |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170910111242/http://people.com/music/celine-dion-beauty-and-the-beast-soundtrack-song/ |archive-date=September 10, 2017  }}</ref> She originally had doubts about whether or not to record the song due to the recent death of her husband and manager [[René Angélil]], who had previously helped her secure the 1991 pop duet. While ultimately accepting the opportunity, she said: "[The] first Beauty and the Beast decision was made with my husband. Now I'm making decisions on my own. It's a little bit harder. I couldn't say yes right away, because I felt like I was kind of cheating in a way". She eventually felt compelled to record the song because of the impact ''Beauty and the Beast'' has had on her career. According to Dion, "I was at the beginning of my career, it put me on the map, it put me where I am today". Also, [[Josh Groban]] was announced to be performing the new original song "[[Evermore (Beauty and the Beast song)|Evermore]]" six days later.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.instagram.com/p/BPdWUimAEhA/|title = I am thrilled to announce that I'll be performing an all-new original song, "How Does A Moment Last Forever," for Disney's live-action Beauty and the Beast.

Several critics regarded the film as inferior to its [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|1991 animated predecessor]]. David Sims of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote that the 2017 film "feels particularly egregious, in part, because it's so slavishly devoted to the original; every time it falls short of its predecessor (which is quite often), it's hard not to notice".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-remake-review/519603/ |title=Beauty and the Beast: A Tale as Old as Time, Told Worse |accessdate=September 1, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170910202831/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-remake-review/519603/ |archive-date=September 10, 2017  }}</ref> [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' said that the 2017 film "takes our knowledge and our interest in the material for granted. It zips from one number to another, throwing a ton of frenetically edited eye candy at the screen, charmlessly." Phillips wrote that the film featured some "less conspicuously talented" performers who are "stuck doing karaoke, or motion-capture work of middling quality", though he praised Kline's performance as the "best, sweetest thing in the movie; he brings a sense of calm, droll authority".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-beauty-and-the-beast-review-20170313-column.html|title='Beauty and the Beast' review: Animated Disney musical's charms lost in translation|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=March 14, 2017|accessdate=March 14, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170910202954/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-beauty-and-the-beast-review-20170313-column.html|archive-date=September 10, 2017}}</ref> [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised Watson's performance and wrote that the film was "lit in that fascinatingly artificial honey-glow light, and it runs smoothly on rails—the kind of rails that bring in and out the stage sets for the lucrative Broadway touring version." In the same newspaper, Wendy Ide criticized the film as "ornate to the point of desperation" in its attempt to emulate the animated film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/03/beauty-and-the-beast-review-emma-watson-disney|title=Beauty and the Beast review&nbsp;– Emma Watson makes a perfect Belle in sugar-rush romance|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|author-link=Peter Bradshaw|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 3, 2017|accessdate=April 28, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428055107/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/03/beauty-and-the-beast-review-emma-watson-disney|archive-date=April 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/19/beauty-and-the-beast-review-undeniably-arresting-emma-watson-josh-gad-bill-condon|title=Beauty and the Beast review&nbsp;– gilt complex|last=Ide|first=Wendy|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 19, 2017|accessdate=April 28, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427104944/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/19/beauty-and-the-beast-review-undeniably-arresting-emma-watson-josh-gad-bill-condon|archive-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref>

Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a B-, writing that the new songs were "not transporting".

Schwartz considered the singing of the cast to be adequate but felt that their voices should have been dubbed over, especially for the complex songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://observer.com/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-changes-dan-stevens-emma-watson/ |title=How 'Beauty and the Beast' Characters Changed from 1991 to 2017 |accessdate=September 1, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170910203128/http://observer.com/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-changes-dan-stevens-emma-watson/ |archive-date=September 10, 2017  }}</ref>

==Controversies==

Controversy erupted after director [[Bill Condon]] said there was a "gay moment" in the film, when LeFou briefly waltzes with Stanley, one of Gaston's friends.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/03/20/beauty-and-the-beast-gay-moment-audience-reaction/99407168/ |title='Beauty and the Beast's 'gay moment' may have been much ado about nothing |newspaper=USA Today |date=March 20, 2017 |accessdate=March 21, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170910204317/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/03/20/beauty-and-the-beast-gay-moment-audience-reaction/99407168/ |archive-date=September 10, 2017  }}</ref> Afterwards in an interview with [[Vulture.com]], Condon stated, "Can I just say, I'm sort of sick of this.

The film also received criticism over its portrayal of LeFou, as many felt that it was used as a way of teasing LGBT+ viewers without providing adequate representation, with his "exclusively gay moment" being three seconds of him dancing with another man at the end of the film.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://screenrant.com/beauty-beast-power-rangers-gay-representation/|title=How Beauty and the Beast & Power Rangers Cheated Gay Fans|date=April 2, 2017|work=Screen Rant|access-date=October 21, 2017|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021111628/http://screenrant.com/beauty-beast-power-rangers-gay-representation/|archive-date=October 21, 2017}}</ref>

===Belle and the Beast's relationship===
Disney has sought to portray Belle as an empowered young woman,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Watkins|first1=Gwynne|title='Beauty and the Beast' Featurette Makes a Case for Feminist Belle|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/beauty-and-the-beast-featurette-makes-a-case-for-feminist-belle-180620182.html|accessdate=March 26, 2017|publisher=Yahoo Movies|date=March 2, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170419051635/https://www.yahoo.com/movies/beauty-and-the-beast-featurette-makes-a-case-for-feminist-belle-180620182.html|archive-date=April 19, 2017}}</ref> but a debate questioning whether it is possible for a captor to fall in love with their prisoner, and whether this is a problematic theme, has resulted.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Zoe|title=Beauty and the Beast: feminist or fraud|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/19/beauty-and-the-beast-feminist-or-fraud|accessdate=March 26, 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 19, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170419051751/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/19/beauty-and-the-beast-feminist-or-fraud|archive-date=April 19, 2017}}</ref> As was the case with the original animated film, one argument is that Belle suffers from [[Stockholm syndrome]] (a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity). Emma Watson studied whether Belle is trapped in an abusive relationship with the Beast before signing on and concluded that she does not think the criticism fits this version of the folk tale.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blasberg|first1=Derek|title=Cover Story: Emma Watson, Rebel Belle|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/emma-watson-cover-story|accessdate=March 27, 2017|work=Vanity Fair|date=February 28, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170228194205/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/emma-watson-cover-story|archive-date=February 28, 2017}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=August 2018}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Breznican|first1=Anthony|title=Beauty and the Beast: Emma Watson addresses questions over Beast relationship|url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/02/16/beauty-and-the-beast-emma-watson-belle-beast-relationship/|accessdate=March 26, 2017|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=February 16, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170910210130/http://ew.com/movies/2017/02/16/beauty-and-the-beast-emma-watson-belle-beast-relationship/|archive-date=September 10, 2017}}</ref> Watson described Stockholm Syndrome as "where a prisoner will take on the characteristics of and fall in love with the captor. Belle actively argues and disagrees with [Beast] constantly. She has none of the characteristics of someone with Stockholm Syndrome because she keeps her independence, she keeps that freedom of thought", also adding that Belle defiantly "gives as good as she gets" before forming a friendship and romance with the Beast.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/02/16/beauty-and-the-beast-emma-watson-belle-beast-relationship/ |title=Beauty and the Beast: Emma Watson addresses questions over Beast relationship |accessdate=August 9, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170910210130/http://ew.com/movies/2017/02/16/beauty-and-the-beast-emma-watson-belle-beast-relationship/ |archive-date=September 10, 2017  }}</ref>

Psychiatrist [[Frank Ochberg]], who was responsible for defining the term "Stockholm syndrome", said he does not think Belle exhibits the trauma symptoms of prisoners suffering from the syndrome because she does not go through a period of feeling that she is going to die.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Watkins|first1=Gwynne|title=Does Belle From 'Beauty and the Beast' Suffer From Stockholm Syndrome?
