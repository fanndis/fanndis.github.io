===Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo===
Sony began in the wake of World War II. In 1946, [[Masaru Ibuka]] started an electronics shop in Shirokiya,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldtokyo.com/shirokiya-department-store/ |title=Shirokiya Department Store, c. 1910-1940. &#124; Old Tokyo |last=Sundberg |first=Stephen |date=18 September 2016 |website=Old Tokyo |language=en-us |access-date=5 November 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918035310/http://www.oldtokyo.com/shirokiya-dept-store.php |archive-date=18 September 2012}}</ref> a department store building in the [[Nihonbashi]] area of [[Tokyo]].

===Name===
When ''Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo'' was looking for a romanized name to use to market themselves, they strongly considered using their initials, TTK. The primary reason they did not is that the railway company [[Tokyu Corporation|Tokyo Kyuko]] was known as TTK.<ref name=History/> The company occasionally used the acronym "Totsuko" in Japan, but during his visit to the United States, Morita discovered that Americans had trouble pronouncing that name. Another early name that was tried out for a while was "Tokyo Teletech" until [[Akio Morita]] discovered that there was an American company already using Teletech as a brand name.<ref>''[[Made in Japan (biography)|Made in Japan]]'' – Akio Morita and Sony (pg. 76) by Akio Morita with [müzik indir] [http://www.indiristan.net/ müzik indir] Edwin M. Rheingold and Mitsuko Shimomura, Signet Books, 1986</ref>

The name "Sony" was chosen for the brand as a mix of two words: one was the [[Latin]] word "''[[wikt:sonus|sonus]]''", which is the root of sonic and sound, and the other was "''[[wikt:sonny|sonny]]''", a common slang term used in 1950s America to call a young boy.<ref name="SonyHistory">[http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/ Sony Corporate History (Japanese)]. Sony.co.jp. Retrieved 7 July 2011.</ref> In 1950s Japan, "sonny boys" was a [[loan word]] in Japanese, which connoted smart and presentable young men, which Sony founders [[Akio Morita]] and [[Masaru Ibuka]] considered themselves to be.<ref name="SonyHistory" />

The first Sony-branded product, the [[TR-55]] [[transistor radio]], appeared in 1955 but the company name did not change to Sony until January 1958.<ref>[http://www.sony.co.uk/article/id/1060176719725 Sony.co.uk. About Sony. ''The History of the Sony Corporation''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128040732/http://www.sony.co.uk/article/id/1060176719725 |date=28 November 2013 }}. Sony.co.uk. Retrieved 7 July 2011.</ref>

At the time of the change, it was extremely unusual for a Japanese company to use [[Romanization of Japanese|Roman letters]] to spell its name instead of writing it in [[kanji]]. The move was not without opposition: TTK's principal bank at the time, [[Mitsui]], had strong feelings about the name. They pushed for a name such as Sony Electronic Industries, or Sony Teletech. Akio Morita was firm, however, as he did not want the company name tied to any particular industry. Eventually, both Ibuka and Mitsui Bank's chairman gave their approval.<ref name=History/>

According to Schiffer, Sony's TR-63 radio "cracked open the U.S. market and launched the new industry of consumer microelectronics."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Focusing on the design of pocket transistor radios manufactured during the 1950s & 1960s! |url=https://www.jamesbutters.com/ |access-date=16 January 2020 |website=Focusing on the design of pocket transistor radios manufactured during the 1950s & 1960s!}}</ref> By the mid-1950s, American teens had begun buying portable transistor radios in huge numbers, helping to propel the fledgling industry from an estimated 100,000 units in 1955 to 5&nbsp;million units by the end of 1968.{{citation needed |date=November 2014}}

Sony co-founder Akio Morita founded Sony Corporation of America in 1960.<ref name="Nobuo" /> In the process, he was struck by the mobility of employees between American companies, which was unheard of in Japan at that time.<ref name="Nobuo" /> When he returned to Japan, he encouraged experienced, middle-aged employees of other companies to reevaluate their careers and consider joining Sony.<ref name="Nobuo" /> The company filled many positions in this manner, and inspired other Japanese companies to do the same.<ref name="Nobuo" /> Moreover, Sony played a major role in the development of Japan as a powerful exporter during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="Christian">Christian, Caryl, and With Hideko Takayama and Kay Itoi in Tokyo, George Wehrfritz in Hong Kong, John Sparks and Michael Hastings in, New York.

In 1971, Masaru Ibuka handed the position of president over to his co-founder Akio Morita. Sony began [[Sony Life|a life insurance company]] in 1979, one of its many peripheral businesses. Amid a global recession in the early 1980s, electronics sales dropped and the company was forced to cut prices.<ref name="Lohr" /> Sony's profits fell sharply. "It's over for Sony", one analyst concluded. "The company's best days are behind it."<ref name="Lohr" /> Around that time, [[Norio Ohga]] took up the role of president. He encouraged the development of the Compact Disc in the 1970s and 1980s, and of the [[PlayStation]] in the early 1990s. Ohga went on to purchase [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] in 1988 and [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1989, greatly expanding Sony's media presence. Ohga would succeed Morita as chief executive officer in 1989.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Digication e-Portfolio :: Navaldeep Singh :: Investigate and Analyze the company's History and Growth |url=https://stonybrook.digication.com/navaldeep_singh/Investigate_and_Analyze_the_company_s_History_and_ |access-date=4 June 2017 |website=stonybrook.digication.com |language=en}}</ref>{{citation needed |date=November 2014}}

Stringer helped to reinvigorate the company's struggling media businesses, encouraging blockbusters such as ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' while cutting 9,000 jobs.<ref name="Christian" /> He hoped to sell off peripheral business and focus the company again on electronics.<ref name="Fackler" /> Furthermore, he aimed to increase cooperation between business units,<ref name="Fackler" /> which he described as "silos" operating in isolation from one another.<ref name="Nakamoto" /> In a bid to provide a unified brand for its global operations, Sony introduced a slogan known as "make.believe" in 2009.<ref name=":0" />{{citation needed |date=November 2014}}

Despite some successes, the company faced continued struggles in the mid- to late-2000s.<ref name="Christian" /> In 2012, [[Kazuo Hirai]] was promoted to president and CEO, replacing Stringer. Shortly thereafter, Hirai outlined his company-wide initiative, named "One Sony" to revive Sony from years of financial losses and bureaucratic management structure, which proved difficult for former CEO Stringer to accomplish, partly due to differences in business culture and native languages between Stringer and some of Sony's Japanese divisions and subsidiaries. Hirai outlined three major areas of focus for Sony's electronics business, which include imaging technology, gaming and mobile technology, as well as a focus on reducing the major losses from the television business.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jeff Blagdon |date=27 March 2012 |title=Sony reorganizes into 'One Sony', prioritizes digital imaging, gaming and mobile |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/27/2905412/sony-management-structure-change-announcement |access-date=10 July 2013 |website=The Verge}}</ref>

==Formats and technologies==
{{Further|List of Sony trademarks}}
Sony has historically been notable for creating its own in-house standards for new recording and storage technologies, instead of adopting those of other manufacturers and standards bodies. Sony (either alone or with partners) has introduced several of the most popular recording formats, including the 3.5-inch [[floppy disk]], [[Compact Disc]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ma'arif |first=Nelly Nailaite |title=The Power of Marketing |publisher=Penerbit Salemba |year=2008 |chapter=15}}</ref>

Sony introduced [[U-matic]], the world's first [[videocassette]] format, in 1971, but the standard was unpopular for domestic use due to the high price.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-01-20 |title=U-matic (1971 – 1990s) |url=https://obsoletemedia.org/u-matic/ |access-date=2020-08-05 |website=Museum of Obsolete Media |language=en-GB}}</ref> The company subsequently launched the [[Betamax]] format in 1975.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Curtis |first=Sophie |date=10 November 2015 |title=Sony is finally killing off Betamax video tapes |language=en-GB |work=Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/sony/11986020/Sony-is-finally-killing-off-Betamax-video-tapes.html |access-date=4 January 2019 |issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Sony was involved in the [[videotape format war]] of the early 1980s, when they were marketing the [[Betamax]] system for video cassette recorders against the [[VHS]] format developed by [[JVC]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=The History of Format Wars and How Sony Finally Won...

Betamax is, for all practical purposes, an obsolete format. Sony's professional-oriented [[component video]] format called [[Betacam]], which was derived from Betamax, was used until 2016 when Sony announced it was stopping production of all remaining 1/2-inch video tape recorders and players, including the Digital Betacam format.<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 May 2014 |title=Digital Betacam (1993–2016) |url=https://obsoletemedia.org/digital-betacam/ |access-date=7 January 2019 |website=Museum of Obsolete Media |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Until late 2004, Sony's [[Walkman#Network Walkman|Network Walkman]] line of digital portable music players did not support the MP3 standard natively.

In 2004, Sony built upon the [[MiniDisc]] format by releasing [[HiMD|Hi-MD]]. Hi-MD allows the playback and recording of audio on newly introduced 1 GB Hi-MD discs in addition to playback and recording on regular MiniDiscs. In addition to saving audio on the discs, Hi-MD allows the storage of computer files such as documents, videos and photos.

===Audio encoding===
In 1993, Sony challenged the industry standard [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1 surround sound format with a newer and more advanced proprietary motion picture digital audio format called [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound|SDDS]] (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound).<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Sony Digital Dynamic Sound |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~clamen/misc/movies/sdds-post.html |access-date=1 February 2019 |website=www.cs.cmu.edu}}</ref> This format employed eight channels (7.1) of audio opposed to just six used in Dolby Digital 5.1 at the time.<ref name=":3" /> Ultimately, SDDS has been vastly overshadowed by the preferred DTS ([[DTS (sound system)|Digital Theatre System]]) and Dolby Digital standards in the motion picture industry. SDDS was solely developed for use in the theatre circuit; Sony never intended to develop a home theatre version of SDDS.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Nailatie. |first=Ma'arif, Nelly |title=The power of marketing : practitioner perspectives in Asia |date=2008 |publisher=Penerbit Salemba Empat |isbn=9789796914456 |oclc=968144111}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Why isn't SDDS in the consumer market? |url=https://www.hometheaterforum.com/community/threads/why-isnt-sdds-in-the-consumer-market.183176/ |access-date=1 February 2019 |website=Blu-ray Movie Discussion, Expert Reviews & News |language=en-US}}</ref>

Sony and [[Philips]] jointly developed the Sony-Philips digital interface format ([[S/PDIF]]) and the high-fidelity audio system [[Super Audio CD|SACD]]. The latter became entrenched in a format war with [[DVD-Audio]]. Still, neither gained a major foothold with the general public. CDs had been preferred by consumers because of the ubiquitous presence of CD drives in consumer devices until the early 2000s when the iPod and streaming services became available.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Waniata |first=Ryan |date=7 February 2018 |title=The Life and Times of the Late, Great CD |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/the-history-of-the-cds-rise-and-fall/ |access-date=1 February 2019 |website=digitaltrends.com}}</ref>

===Optical storage===
[[File:Sony BD-RE 200GB front side 20080119.jpg|thumb|Front side of a Sony 200GB Blu-ray disc]]
Sony demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in 1977 and soon joined hands with Philips, another major contender for the storage technology, to establish a worldwide standard.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The history of the CD – The beginning – Research |url=https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/technologies/cd/beginning.html |access-date=2020-08-03 |website=Philips |language=en}}</ref> In 1983, the two company jointly announced the [[compact disc|Compact Disc]] (CD). In 1984, Sony launched the [[Discman]] series, an expansion of the Walkman brand to portable CD players. Sony began to improve performance and capacity of the novel format. It launched write-once [[optical disc]]s (WO) and [[Magneto-optical drive|magneto-optical discs]] which were around 125MB size for the specific use of archival data storage, in 1986 and 1988 respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |year=2007 |title=Sony History on development of Magneto Optical Discs |url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-21/h4.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061224013537/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-21/h4.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=24 December 2006 |access-date=6 February 2007}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, two high-density optical storage standards were being developed: one was the MultiMedia Compact Disc (MMCD), backed by Philips and Sony, and the other was the Super Density Disc (SD), supported by [[Toshiba]] and many others. Philips and Sony abandoned their MMCD format and agreed upon Toshiba's SD format with only one modification. The unified disc format was called [[DVD]] and was introduced in 1997.

Sony was one of the leading developers of the [[Blu-ray]] optical disc format, the newest standard for disc-based content delivery. The first Blu-ray players became commercially available in 2006. The format emerged as the standard for HD media over the competing format, Toshiba's [[HD DVD]], after a two-year-long [[high-definition optical disc format war]].

Sony's [[Laser communication in space|laser communication]] devices for [[small satellite]]s rely on the technologies developed for the company's optical disc products.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sony to launch space business |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Sony-to-launch-space-business |access-date=21 April 2018 |website=Nikkei Asian Review}}</ref>

===Disk storage===
In 1983, Sony introduced 90&nbsp;mm micro diskettes (better known as {{convert|3.5|in|mm|adj=on}} [[floppy disk]]s), which it had developed at a time when there were 4" floppy disks, and many variations from different companies, to replace the then on-going 5.25" floppy disks. Sony had great success and the format became dominant. 3.5" floppy disks gradually became obsolete as they were replaced by current media formats. Sony held more than a 70 percent share of the market when it decided to pull the plug on the format in 2010.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ma'arif |first=Nelly Nailatie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oc_0AkhysO0C&q=Sony+had+great+success+and+the+format+became+dominant.+3.5%22+floppy+disks+gradually+became+obsolete+as+they+were+replaced+by+current+media+formats&pg=PT194 |title=Power of Marketing |date=2008 |publisher=Penerbit Salemba |isbn=9789796914456 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Floppy disk history: The evolution of personal computing |url=https://www.hpe.com/us/en/insights/articles/floppy-disk-history-the-evolution-of-personal-computing-1804.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Flash memory===
In 1998, Sony launched the [[Memory Stick]] format, the [[flash memory]] cards for use in Sony lines of digital cameras and portable music players. It has seen little support outside of Sony's own products, with [[Secure Digital card]]s (SD) commanding considerably greater popularity. Sony has made updates to the Memory Stick format with [[Memory Stick#Memory Stick Duo and PRO Duo|Memory Stick Duo]] and [[Memory Stick Micro]].

=== Communication ===
Sony introduced [[FeliCa]], a contactless IC card technology primarily used in [[contactless payment]], as a result of the company's joint development and commercialization of [[near-field communication|Near-Field Communication]] (NFC) with Philips. The standard is largely offered in two forms, either chips embedded in smartphones or plastic cards with chips embedded in them. Sony plans to implement this technology in train systems across Asia.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Alpeyev |first1=Pavel |last2=Huang |first2=Grace |date=15 October 2015 |title=Sony's Answer to Apple Pay Is Laying Tracks for Asian Expansion |publisher=Bloomberg Business |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-16/sony-s-answer-to-apple-pay-is-laying-tracks-for-asian-expansion |access-date=19 October 2015}}</ref>

In 2019, Sony launched the ELTRES, the company's proprietary low-power wide-area wireless communication ([[LPWAN]]) standard.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-05-30 |title=Sony unveils LPWA IoT communication module |url=https://www.eenewsautomotive.com/news/sony-unveils-lpwa-iot-communication-module |access-date=2020-08-03 |website=eeNews Automotive |language=en}}</ref>

==Business units==
{{Further|List of assets owned by Sony}}
Best known for its electronic products, Sony offers a wide variety of product lines in many areas. At its peak, it was dubbed as a "corporate octopus", for its sprawling ventures from private insurance to chemicals to cosmetics to home shopping to Tokyo-based French food joint, let alone its core businesses such as electronics and entertainment.<ref name="Fackler" /> Even after it has unwound many business units including [[Sony Chemicals]] and [[Vaio]] PC, Sony still runs diverse businesses.

As of 2020, Sony is organized into the following business segments: Game & Network Services (G&NS), Music, Pictures, Electronics Products & Solutions (EP&S), Imaging & Sensing Solutions (I&SS), Financial Services, and Others.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |title=Sony Global – Organization Data |url=https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/Data/organization.html |access-date=3 July 2020 |website=www.sony.net}}</ref> Usually, each business segment has a handful of corresponding intermediate holding companies under which all the related businesses are folded into, such as [[Columbia Records]] being part of [[Sony Music]] Group, a subsidiary and, at the same time, a holding company for Sony's music businesses, along with [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|SMEJ]].

Sony released the world's first portable music player, the [[Walkman]], in 1979, bundled with the MDL-3L2 [[headphones]].

Sony stopped production of Trinitron for most markets, but continued producing sets for markets such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and China. Sony discontinued its series of Trinitron computer monitors in 2005. The company discontinued the last Trinitron-based television set in the US in early 2007. The end of Trinitron marked the end of Sony's analog television sets and monitors.

Sony used the LCD [[WEGA]] name for its [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] TVs until summer 2005. The company then introduced the [[Bravia (brand)|BRAVIA]] name. BRAVIA is an in-house brand owned by Sony which produces high-definition LCD televisions, projection TVs and front projectors, home cinemas and the BRAVIA home theatre range. All Sony high-definition flat-panel LCD televisions in North America have carried the logo for BRAVIA since 2005. In 2006, Sony lost its decades-long No.1 market share in the global television market. In November 2007, the [[Sony XEL-1]], the first [[OLED]] television, was released and manufactured for two years.

Sony offers a wide range of digital cameras. Its point-and-shoot models adopt the [[Cyber-shot]] name, while [[digital single-lens reflex]] models are branded using [[Sony Alpha|Alpha]]. It also produces [[action camera]]s and [[camcorder]]s, with the company's [[Digital movie camera|cinema-grade]] products being sold under the [[CineAlta]] name.

Sony demonstrated a prototype of the [[Sony Mavica]] in 1981 and released it for the consumer market in 1988. The first Cyber-shot was introduced in 1996. Sony's [[market share]] of the digital camera market fell from a high of 20% to 9% by 2005.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sony Global – Product & Technology Milestones-Digital Camera |url=https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/sonyhistory-g.html |access-date=2020-08-03 |website=www.sony.net}}</ref><ref name="Nakamoto">Nakamoto, Michiyo.

Sony entered the market for [[digital single-lens reflex camera]]s in 2006 when it acquired the camera business of [[Konica Minolta]]. Sony rebranded the company's line of cameras as its [[Sony Alpha|Alpha]] line. Sony is the world's third largest manufacturer of the cameras, behind [[Canon (company)|Canon]] and [[Nikon]] respectively.

In 2010, Sony introduced their first [[mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera]]s, which were the [[NEX-3]] and the [[Sony NEX-5|NEX-5]]. They also started a new lens mount system, which was the [[Sony E-mount|E-mount.]] There were quite a few NEX models out there, when Sony decided to melt the NEX series into the Alpha series. The first Alpha MILC was the [[Sony α3000|α3000]], which was introduced in August 2013. It was followed by the Full-Frame [[Sony α7|α7]] and [[α7R]] in October, then the successors of the [[Sony NEX-5|NEX-5]], the [[Sony NEX-6|NEX-6]] and [[Sony NEX-7|NEX-7]], the [[Sony α5000|α5000]] and the [[Sony α6000|α6000]] in 2014. The α6000 became the most popular [[Mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera|MILC]] ever and Sony became the largest MILC manufacturer. Sony didn't announce a new [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLR]] since the November 2015, which was the [[α68]].

Sony Mobile Communications Inc. (formerly Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications) is a multinational [[smartphone]] manufacturing company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation.

In 2001, Sony entered into a joint venture with Swedish telecommunications company [[Ericsson]], forming Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications.<ref name="Sony Ericsson press release">{{Cite press release |title=Sony and Ericsson complete joint venture agreement |date=28 August 2001 |publisher=Sony |url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/200108/01-0828/ |access-date=26 May 2012}}</ref> Initial sales were rocky, and the company posted losses in 2001 and 2002. However, Sony Ericsson reached a profit in 2003. The company distinguished itself with multimedia-capable mobile phones, which included features such as cameras. These were unusual at the time. Despite their innovations, Sony Ericsson faced intense competition from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]], which was released in 2007. From 2008 to 2010, amid a global recession, Sony Ericsson slashed its workforce by several thousand. In 2009, Sony Ericsson was the fourth-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world (after [[Nokia]], [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] and [[LG Electronics|LG]]).<ref>[http://www.telecomskorea.com/market-8211.html nonmember].

==== Robotics ====
Since the late 1990s, Sony has released numerous consumer robots, including dog-shaped robots called [[AIBO]], a music playing robot called [[Sony Rolly|Rolly]], and a [[humanoid]] robot called [[QRIO]]. Despite being a pioneer in the field, Sony had ceased robotics-related operations for 10 years due to financial difficulties, until it decided to revive them in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2016-06-29 |title=UPDATE 2-Sony upbeat on games and robots but cuts outlook for image sensors |language=de |work=Reuters |url=https://de.reuters.com/article/sony-outlook-idUKL4N19L0TF |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref>

===Imaging & Sensing Solutions===
Sony traces its roots in the semiconductor business back to 1954, when it became the first Japanese company to commercialize the [[transistor]] invented and licensed by [[Bell Labs]]; Sony is one of the earliest and the youngest recipients of the novel technology, together with [[Texas Instruments]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Group｜Corporate Information｜Sony Semiconductor Solutions Group |url=https://www.sony-semicon.co.jp/e/company/group/ |access-date=2020-08-03 |website=Sony Semiconductor Solutions Group |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=1952: Bell Labs Licenses Transistor Technology {{!}} The Silicon Engine {{!}} Computer History Museum |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/bell-labs-licenses-transistor-technology/ |access-date=2020-09-28 |website=www.computerhistory.org}}</ref> In 1957, Sony employee [[Leo Esaki]] and his colleagues invented a [[tunnel diode]] (usually referred to as Esaki diode) by which they discovered the [[Quantum tunnelling|quantum tunneling]] effect in solids, for which Esaki received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel prize in Physics]] in 1973.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1973 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1973/esaki/biographical/ |access-date=2020-10-06 |website=NobelPrize.org |language=en-US}}</ref>

Sony Interactive Entertainment (formerly Sony Computer Entertainment) is best known for producing the popular line of PlayStation consoles. The line grew out of a failed partnership with [[Nintendo]]. Originally, Nintendo requested Sony to develop an add-on for [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|its console]] that would play Compact Discs. In 1991 Sony announced [[SNES-CD|the add-on]], as well as a dedicated console known as the "Play Station".<!--DO NOT CHANGE TO PLAYSTATION. There was a space in the proposed name.--> However, a disagreement over software licensing for the console caused the partnership to fall through. Sony then continued the project independently.

Launched in 1994, the first [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] gained 61% of global console sales and broke Nintendo's long-standing lead in the market.<ref name="Quest">"The PlayStation Quest."  Macleans 6 November 2000: 81-. ABI/INFORM Global; ProQuest Research Library. Web. 27 May 2012.</ref> Sony followed up with the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2000, which was even more successful. The console has become the most successful of all time, selling over 150&nbsp;million units {{as of|2011|lc=on}}. Sony released the [[PlayStation 3]], a high-definition console, in 2006. It was the first console to use the [[Blu-ray]] format, and was considerably more expensive than the competitors [[Xbox 360]] and [[Wii]] due to the [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell processor]].<ref name="Nakamoto" /> Early on, poor sales performance resulted in significant losses for the company, pushing it to sell the console at a [[loss leader|loss]].<ref name="Pilling">Pilling, David. "Camera Sales Raise Sonys Game."  Financial Times: 23. ABI/INFORM Global. 27 July 2007.

[[File:PlayStation 2 comparison.png|thumb|upright|The [[PlayStation 2]] is the best-selling video game console of all time ]]
Sony extended the brand to the portable games market in 2004 with the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP). The console has sold reasonably, but has taken a second place to a rival handheld, the [[Nintendo DS]]. Sony developed the [[Universal Media Disc]] (UMD) optical disc medium for use on the PlayStation Portable. Early on, the format was used for movies, but it has since lost major studio support. Sony released a disc-less version of its PlayStation Portable, the [[PlayStation Portable#PSP Go (N1000)|PSP Go]], in 2009. The company went on to release its second portable video game system, [[PlayStation Vita]], in 2011 and 2012. Sony launched its fourth console, the [[PlayStation 4]], on 15 November 2013, which as of 31 December 2017 has sold 73.6&nbsp;million units globally.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=PLAYSTATION 4 SELLS 5.9 MILLION UNITS WORLDWIDE DURING THE 2017 HOLIDAY SEASON |date=8 January 2018 |publisher=Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. |location=San Mateo |url=http://www.sie.com/en/corporate/release/2018/180109.html |access-date=16 April 2018 |via=sie.com}}</ref>

On 18 March 2014, at [[Game Developers Conference|GDC]], president of [[Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios]] [[Shuhei Yoshida]] announced their new virtual reality technology dubbed Project Morpheus, and later named [[PlayStation VR]], for PlayStation 4. The headset brought VR gaming and non-gaming software to the company's console. According to a report released by Houston-based patent consulting firm [[LexInnova Technologies|LexInnova]] in May 2015, Sony is leading the virtual reality patent race.

[[Sony Entertainment]] has two divisions: Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Music Group (Sony Music Entertainment, Sony/ATV Music Publishing). [[Sony Corporation of America|Sony USA]] previously owned and operated Sony Trans Com: a technology business that provided in-flight entertainment programming as well as video and audio playback equipment for the airline industry. Sony had purchased the business from Sundstrand Corp. in 1989 and subsequently sold it to [[Rockwell Collins]] in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 July 1991 |title=Sundstrand Selling Trans Com Systems To Sony |url=https://www.apnews.com/0b3960e064a66f9a5c0057fd4525a89a |access-date=12 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=1 June 2000 |title=Rockwell Collins Acquires Sony Trans Com |url=http://aviationweek.com/awin/rockwell-collins-acquires-sony-trans-com-0 |access-date=12 August 2018}}</ref>

Sony Music Entertainment (also known as SME or Sony Music) is the second-largest global [[music industry|recorded music company]] of the [[Music industry#Consolidation|"big three" record companies]] and is controlled by [[Sony Corporation of America]], the United States subsidiary of Japan's ''Sony''.

In one of its largest-ever acquisitions, Sony purchased [[Columbia Records|CBS Record Group]] in 1988 for US$2&nbsp;billion.<ref name="UPI Archives">[https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/01/05/Sony-completes-2-billion-purchase-of-CBS-Records/2527568357200/ Sony completes $2 billion purchase of CBS Records] upi.com 5 January 1988, Retrieved on 3 December 2017</ref> In the process, Sony partnered and gained the rights to the ATV catalogue of Michael Jackson, considered by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' to be the most successful entertainer of all time. The acquisition of CBS Records provided the foundation for the formation of Sony Music Entertainment, which Sony established in 1991.

In 1968, Sony and CBS Records had formed a 50:50 joint-venture CBS/Sony Records, later renamed CBS/Sony Group, in Japan. When CBS Records was acquired, a 50% stake in CBS/Sony Group owned by CBS was also transferred to Sony. In March 1988, four wholly owned subsidiaries were folded into CBS/Sony Group and the company was renamed as [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan]] (SMEJ). It operates independently of Sony Music as it is directly owned by Japanese Sony. SMEJ also owns [[anime]] distributors and studios such as [[Funimation]], [[Madman Entertainment]] (both are co-owned by SPE), [[Aniplex]], [[CloverWorks]], and [[A-1 Pictures]].

In 2004, Sony entered into a joint venture with [[Bertelsmann AG]], merging Sony Music Entertainment with [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] to create [[Sony BMG]]. In 2005, Sony BMG faced a [[Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal|copy protection scandal]], because its music CDs had installed [[rootkit|malware]] on users' computers that was posing a security risk to affected customers.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Brown |first=Bob |date=1 November 2010 |title=Sony BMG rootkit scandal: 5 years later |work=Network World |url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2194292/network-security/sony-bmg-rootkit-scandal--5-years-later.html |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref> In 2007, the company acquired [[Famous Music]] for US$370&nbsp;million, gaining the rights to the catalogues of [[Eminem]] and [[Akon]], among others. Sony bought out Bertelsmann's share in Sony BMG and formed a new Sony Music Entertainment in 2008. Since then, the company has undergone management changes.

Sony purchased digital music recognition company [[Gracenote]] for US$260&nbsp;million in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 April 2008 |title=Sony to Buy Gracenote Music Data Company |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/PCWorld/story?id=4706733 |access-date=11 February 2015 |website=abcnews.go.com}}</ref> [[Tribune Media Company]] acquired Gracenote from Sony in 2014 for $170&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tribune To Acquire Sony Audio Recognition Unit Gracenote For $170 Million |url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2013/12/23/sony-spins-out-gracenote/}}</ref>

Besides its record label, Sony operates other music businesses. In 1995, Sony merged its publisher with [[Michael Jackson]]'s [[ATV Music Publishing]], forming Sony/ATV Music Publishing. At the time, the publishing company was the second largest of its kind in the world. The company owns the publishing rights to over 4&nbsp;million compositions, including [[The Beatles]]' [[Lennon-McCartney]] catalogue, [[Bob Dylan]], [[Eminem]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Ed Sheeran]], and [[Taylor Swift]].

In 2012, Sony/ATV acquired a majority stake in [[EMI Music Publishing]], becoming the world's largest music publishing company. In 2018, Sony bought the rest of the shares in the publisher, making it a wholly owned subsidiary.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Halperin |first=Shirley |date=30 June 2012 |title=Sold!

===Finances===
Sony is one of Japan's largest corporations by market capitalization and operating profit. As of July 2020, its market value is at over $90&nbsp;billion, placing Sony as one of the five most valuable companies in Japan. At the same period, Sony was also recognized as the most cash-rich Japanese company, with its [[Net cash flow|net cash reserves]] of ¥1.8&nbsp;trillion.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2 June 2020 |title=コロナに負けない｢金持ち企業｣トップ500社 {{!}} 企業ランキング |url=https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/359062 |access-date=11 July 2020 |website=東洋経済オンライン |language=ja}}</ref>

The company was immensely profitable throughout the 1990s and early 2000s in part because of the success of its new [[PlayStation]] line. The company encountered financial difficulty in the mid- to late-2000s due to a number of factors: the [[global financial crisis]], increased competition for PlayStation, and the devastating [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Japanese earthquake of 2011]]. The company faced three consecutive years of losses leading up to 2011.<ref name="FT">"Sony: Too Much make-Believe." FT.com (2011): n/a. ABI/INFORM Global; ProQuest Research Library. Web. 26 May 2012.</ref> While noting the negative effects of intervening circumstances such as natural disasters and fluctuating currency exchange rates,<ref name="FT" /> the ''[[Financial Times]]'' criticized the company for its "lack of resilience" and "inability to gauge the economy."<ref name="FT" /> The newspaper voiced skepticism about Sony's revitalization efforts, given a lack of tangible results.<ref name="FT" />

In September 2000 Sony had a market capitalization of $100&nbsp;billion; but by December 2011 it had plunged to $18&nbsp;billion, reflecting falling prospects for Sony but also reflecting grossly inflated share prices of the '[[dot-com bubble]]' years.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Fujimura |first=Naoko |date=12 December 2011 |title=Sony's Shopping Spree Is 'Wrong Direction' in Apple Battle: Tech |agency=[[Bloomberg News]] |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-13/stringer-s-shopping-spree-wrong-direction-for-sony-in-apple-battle-tech.html |access-date=18 December 2011}}</ref> Net worth, as measured by stockholder equity, has steadily grown from $17.9&nbsp;billion in March 2002 to $35.6&nbsp;billion through December 2011.<ref>[http://www.gurufocus.com/financials.php?symbol=sne 10 Year Financials of sne&nbsp;– Sony Corp Adr].

Retrieved on 25 April 2012.</ref> Earnings yield (inverse of the price to earnings ratio) has never been more than 5% and usually much less; thus Sony has always traded in over-priced ranges with the exception of the 2009 market bottom.

On 9 December 2008, Sony Corporation announced that it would be cutting 8,000 jobs, dropping 8,000 contractors and reducing its global manufacturing sites by 10% to save $1.1&nbsp;billion per year.<ref>{{Cite news |last=McCurry |first=Justin |date=9 December 2008 |title=Sony to cut 8,000 jobs worldwide |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/09/sony-job-cuts |access-date=23 May 2010}}</ref>

In April 2012, Sony announced that it would reduce its workforce by 10,000 (6% of its employee base) as part of CEO [[Kaz Hirai]]'s effort to get the company back into the black. This came after a loss of 520&nbsp;billion yen (roughly US$6.36&nbsp;billion) for fiscal 2012, the worst since the company was founded.
