A new trailer for ''Star Trek Beyond'' featuring "Sledgehammer", was released on June 27, 2016, the same day that the song was released.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sotteck|first1=T.C.|title=Rihanna teases Monday release for new Star Trek Beyond song|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/26/12033804/rihanna-sledgehammer-star-trek-beyond|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=The Verge|date=June 26, 2016}}</ref> Rihanna subsequently said that she had been a fan of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise since she was a child, after being introduced to it by her father. She explained that "This is something that's been a part of me since my childhood, it's never left me, I love ''Star Trek''. It was automatic. I would do anything in terms of music. It's such a big deal not only as a fan, as a musician... because ''Star Trek'' is such a big deal across the globe."<ref name="billboardfan"/>

==Critical reception==
Camila Cassidy of ''[[Wessex Scene#The Edge|The Edge]]'' gave the song a generally positive review stating, "She pretty much nailed it – it feels tone perfect. It’s a little orchestral, swooping, but with a strong enough chorus and verse pattern to be commercially successful." However she also stated, "As a dramatic theatrical piece? It’s a little weak, too much fuss with the lyrics while instrumentation takes a back seat. As a radio hit? The vocals aren’t prominent enough...Both are excellent, but both just need to be more."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theedgesusu.co.uk/records/singles/2016/07/02/review-rihanna-sledgehammer|title= Review: Rihanna – ‘Sledgehammer’ |date=July 2, 2016|work=The Edge}}</ref> Daniel Kreps from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote, "Rihanna sings on the aching chorus, which sports a monster hook typical of Sia's work."<ref name=r>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hear-rihannas-aching-star-trek-beyond-ballad-sledgehammer-20160627|title=Hear Rihanna's Aching 'Star Trek Beyond' Ballad 'Sledgehammer'|date=June 27, 2016|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Rachel Sonis from [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] gave the song a 7/10, stating, "The Aussie singer-songwriter knows exactly how vast Rih[anna]’s vocal abilities are and isn’t afraid to push them. No doubt, this probably came in handy, since “Sledgehammer” — from Rihanna’s haunting drones to the song’s thunderous melody — is a monster of a track."<ref name=i>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7638264/pop-perspective-rihanna-sledgehammer-reviewed|title=Pop Perspective: Rihanna’s “Sledgehammer” Rated & Reviewed|date=June 27, 2016r|work=Idolator}}</ref> A Bit of Pop Music wrote, "‘Sledgehammer’ is a powerful pop ballad with a huge chorus, that should do well in combination with the probable success of its movie...but it might be time for Sia to shake up her formula a bit, as ‘Sledgehammer’ is in no way a surprising composition."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abitofpopmusic.com/2016/06/27/single-review-rihanna-sledgehammer|title=Single Review: Rihanna – Sledgehamme|date=June 27, 2016|work=A bit of Pop Music}}</ref>

==Music video==
A music video for the song premiered June 30, 2016 in IMAX theaters at 9:00am EST. The video was then released onto [[Vevo]] and [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] an hour later. The music video was the first to be shot entirely with IMAX cameras.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/30/12067182/star-trek-beyond-rihanna-sledgehammer-music-video|title=Rihanna and the Starship Enterprise costar in the trippy video for Sledgehammer|accessdate=June 30, 2016|work=The Verge}}</ref> The music video features Rihanna dressed in a sci-fi costume performing magical acts, with Swarm Ships from Star Trek Beyond flying around her.
