'''''The Observer''''' is a British newspaper [[Sunday editions|published on Sundays]]. In the same place on the [[political spectrum]] as its sister papers ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'', whose parent company [[Guardian Media Group|Guardian Media Group Limited]] acquired it in 1993, it takes a [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] or [[Social democracy|social democratic]] line on most issues. First published in 1791, it is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8184667.stm |work=BBC News  | title=The Observer under review | date=4 August 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

==History==
===Origins===
The first issue, published on 4 December 1791 by W.S. Bourne, was the world's first [[Sunday newspaper]].<ref name="theguardian.com">https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/2002/jun/06/2</ref> Believing that the paper would be a means of wealth, Bourne instead soon found himself facing debts of nearly £1,600. Though early editions purported editorial independence, Bourne attempted to cut his losses and sell the title to the government. When this failed, Bourne's brother (a wealthy businessman) made an offer to the government, which also refused to buy the paper but agreed to subsidise it in return for influence over its editorial content. As a result, the paper soon took a strong line against radicals such as [[Thomas Paine]], [[Francis Burdett]] and [[Joseph Priestley]].

===Nineteenth century===
In 1807, the brothers decided to relinquish editorial control, naming [[Lewis Doxat]] as the new editor. Seven years later, the brothers sold ''The Observer'' to [[William Innell Clement]], a newspaper proprietor who owned a number of publications. The paper continued to receive government subsidies during this period; in 1819, of the approximately 23,000 copies of the paper distributed weekly, approximately 10,000 were given away as "specimen copies", distributed by postmen who were paid to deliver them to "lawyers, doctors, and gentlemen of the town."<ref>[[Dennis Griffiths]] (ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of the British Press, 1422–1992'', London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1992, p. 159.</ref> Yet the paper began to demonstrate a more independent editorial stance, criticising the authorities' handling of the events surrounding the [[Peterloo Massacre]] and defying an 1820 court order against publishing details of the trial of the [[Cato Street Conspiracy|Cato Street Conspirators]], who were alleged to have plotted to murder members of the Cabinet. The [[woodcut]] pictures published of the stable and hayloft where the conspirators were arrested reflected a new stage of illustrated journalism that the newspaper pioneered during this time.

Clement maintained ownership of ''The Observer'' until his death in 1852. During that time, the paper supported [[Reform Act 1832|parliamentary reform]], but opposed a broader franchise and the [[Chartism|Chartist]] leadership. After Doxat retired in 1857, Clement's heirs sold the paper to Joseph Snowe, who also took over the editor's chair. Under Snowe, the paper adopted a more liberal political stance, supporting the North during the [[American Civil War]],<ref name="observerTextTimeline">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/2002/jun/11/2|title=Key moments in the Observer's history – a timeline|date=7 November 2017|website=The Guardian}}</ref> and endorsing universal manhood suffrage in 1866.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} These positions contributed to a decline in circulation during this time.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In 1870, wealthy businessman [[Julius Beer]] bought the paper and appointed [[Edward Dicey]] as editor, whose efforts succeeded in reviving circulation. Though Beer's son Frederick became the owner upon Julius's death in 1880, he had little interest in the newspaper and was content to leave Dicey as editor until 1889. Henry Duff Traill took over the editorship after Dicey's departure, only to be replaced in 1891 by Frederick's wife, [[Rachel Beer]],<ref name="theguardian.com"/> of the [[Sassoon family]]. Though circulation declined during her tenure, she remained as editor for thirteen years, combining it in 1893 with the editorship of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', a newspaper that she had also bought.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adinfo-guardian.co.uk/the-observer/observer-history.shtml|title=Ad Info – Observer History|date=17 September 2009|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917013231/http://www.adinfo-guardian.co.uk/the-observer/observer-history.shtml|archivedate=17 September 2009}}</ref>

===Twentieth century===
Upon Frederick's death in 1903, the paper was purchased by the newspaper magnate [[Lord Northcliffe]]. After maintaining the existing editorial leadership for a couple of years, in 1908 Northcliffe named [[James Louis Garvin]] as editor. Garvin quickly turned the paper into an organ of political influence, boosting circulation from 5,000 to 40,000 within a year of his arrival as a result. Yet the revival in the paper's fortunes masked growing political disagreements between Garvin and Northcliffe. These disagreements ultimately led Northcliffe to sell the paper to [[William Waldorf Astor]] in 1911, who transferred ownership to his son [[Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor]] four years later.

During this period, the Astors were content to leave the control of the paper in Garvin's hands. Under his editorship circulation reached 200,000 during the interwar years, a figure which Garvin fought to maintain even during the depths of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]]. Politically the paper pursued an independent [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] stance, which eventually brought Garvin into conflict with Waldorf's more liberal son [[David Astor]]. Their conflict contributed to Garvin's departure as editor in 1942, after which the paper took the unusual step of declaring itself non-partisan.

Ownership passed to Waldorf's sons in 1948, with David taking over as editor. He remained in the position for 27 years, during which time he turned it into a trust-owned newspaper employing, among others, [[George Orwell]], [[Paul Jennings (UK author)|Paul Jennings]] and [[C. A. Lejeune]]. Under Astor's editorship ''The Observer'' became the first national newspaper to oppose the government's [[Suez crisis|1956 invasion of Suez]], a move which cost it many readers. In 1977, the Astors sold the ailing newspaper to US oil giant [[ARCO|Atlantic Richfield]] (now called ARCO) who sold it to [[Lonrho|Lonrho plc]] in 1981.

It became part of the [[Guardian Media Group]] in June 1993, after a rival bid to acquire it by ''[[The Independent]]'' was rejected.<ref name="Indy">Michael Leapman, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/new-editor-chosen-for-observer-guardian-deputy-to-succeed-trelford-2322911.html "New editor chosen for 'Observer': 'Guardian' deputy to succeed Trelford"], ''The Independent'', 14 May 1993, accessed 22 January 2018.</ref>

[[Farzad Bazoft]], a journalist for ''The Observer'', was executed in [[Iraq]] in 1990 on charges of spying. In 2003, ''The Observer'' interviewed the Iraqi colonel who had arrested and interrogated Bazoft and who was convinced that Bazoft was not a spy.<ref name="Farzad1">[[Ed Vulliamy]], [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/may/18/Iraqandthemedia.iraq "Writer hanged by Iraq 'no spy'"], ''The Guardian'', 18 May 2003, accessed 4 April 2007.</ref>

===Twenty-first century===
In 2003 the editorial supported the Iraq war, stating "Military intervention in the Middle East holds many dangers. But if we want a lasting peace it may be the only option."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/15/iraq-war "Iraq war: the march of time"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2013.</ref>

On 27 February 2005, ''The Observer'' Blog<ref name="ObserverBlog1">[https://www.theguardian.com/news/observerblog Observer blog], accessed 27 February 2007.</ref> was launched, making ''The Observer'' the first newspaper to purposely document its own internal decisions, as well as the first newspaper to release [[podcast]]s. The paper's regular columnists include [[Andrew Rawnsley]] and [[Nick Cohen]].

In addition to the weekly ''Observer Magazine'' [[colour supplement]] which is still present every Sunday, for several years each issue of ''The Observer'' came with a different free monthly magazine. These magazines had the titles ''Observer Sport Monthly'', ''Observer Music Monthly'', ''Observer Woman'' and ''Observer Food Monthly''.

Content from ''The Observer'' is included in ''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'' for an international readership.

''The Observer'' followed its daily partner ''[[The Guardian]]'' and converted to [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] format on Sunday 8 January 2006.<ref name="GuardianObserverRelaunch1">Claire Cozens, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/dec/19/theobserver.pressandpublishing "Observer announces relaunch date"], ''The Observer'', 19 December 2005; accessed 27 February 2007.</ref><ref name="GuardianObserverRelaunch2">[https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive The archive – summary of holdings], accessed 27 February 2007.</ref>

''The Observer'' was awarded the ''National Newspaper of the Year'' at the [[British Press Awards]] 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pressawards.org.uk/page-view.php?pagename=2000-2008-Winners |title=Press Awards |first=Magstar |last=Ltd |website=www.pressawards.org.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402232510/http://www.pressawards.org.uk/page-view.php?pagename=2000-2008-Winners |archivedate=2 April 2016}}</ref> Editor [[Roger Alton]] stepped down at the end of 2007, and was replaced by his deputy, [[John Mulholland (journalist)|John Mulholland]].<ref name=guardian-20080103>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/03/theobserver.pressandpublishing |title=Mulholland reshapes Observer team |author=Stephen Brook |work=The Guardian|location=UK |date=3 January 2008 |accessdate=17 February 2008}}</ref>

In early 2010, the paper was restyled. An article on the paper's website previewing the new version stated that "The News section, which will incorporate Business and personal finance, will be home to a new section, Seven Days, offering a complete round-up of the previous week's main news from Britain and around the world, and will also focus on more analysis and comment."<ref>John Mulholland, [https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2010/feb/21/new-observer "Welcome to the new Observer"], Guardian.co.uk, 21 February 2010.</ref>

==Supplements and features==
After the paper was rejuvenated in early 2010, the main paper came with only a small number of supplements – ''Sport'', ''The Observer Magazine'', ''The New Review'' and ''The New York Times International Weekly'', an 8-page supplement of articles selected from ''[[The New York Times]]'' that has been distributed with the paper since 2007. Every four weeks the paper includes ''The Observer Food Monthly'' magazine, and in September 2013 it launched ''Observer Tech Monthly'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Observer to launch new monthly technology supplement|author=Gavriel Hollander|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/observer-launch-new-monthly-technology-supplement|website=Press Gazette|date=27 August 2003|accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref> a science and technology section which won the Grand Prix at the 2014 Newspaper Awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Observer wins top prize at 2014 Newspaper Awards|url=https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/observer-wins-top-prize-at-newspaper-awards|website=The Guardian|date=2 April 2014|accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref>

Previously, the main paper had come with a larger range of supplements including ''Sport'', ''Business & Media'', ''Review'', ''Escape'' (a travel supplement), ''The Observer Magazine'' and various special interest monthlies, such as ''Observer Food Monthly'', ''Observer Women monthly'' which was launched in 2006,<ref>{{cite journal|title=New editor at the FINANCIAL TIMES|journal=Press Business|date=February 2006|issue=1|url=http://www.press-business.com/pdf/2006_01_press_business.pdf|accessdate=7 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014110104/http://www.press-business.com/pdf/2006_01_press_business.pdf|archivedate=14 October 2013}}</ref> ''Observer Sport Monthly'' and ''The Observer Film Magazine''.

==The Newsroom==
''The Observer'' and its sister newspaper ''The Guardian'' operate a visitor centre in London called The Newsroom.  It contains their archives, including bound copies of old editions, a photographic library and other items such as diaries, letters and notebooks. This material may be consulted by members of the public.  The Newsroom also mounts temporary exhibitions and runs an educational programme for schools.

In November 2007, ''The Observer'' and ''The Guardian'' made their archives available over the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/jun/26/how-to-access-guardian-and-observer-digital-archive|title=How to access past articles from the Guardian and Observer archive|date=15 November 2017|website=The Guardian}}</ref> The current extent of the archives available are 1791 to 2000 for ''The Observer'' and 1821 to 2000 for ''The Guardian''.
