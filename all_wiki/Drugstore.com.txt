'''drugstore.com''' was an internet retailer in health and beauty care products. Its [[web operations]] were launched on February 24, 1999, and shut down on September 30, 2016<ref name="Walgreens-Boots-Alliance,-Inc-Jul-2016-8-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2420/119312516661167/filing-main.htm |title=Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jul 28, 2016 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 11, 2018}}</ref> after being acquired by [[Walgreens]] in March 2011 for $409 million.<ref name="Walgreens-Co-Mar-2011-8-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1484/95012311028698/filing-main.htm |title=Walgreens Co, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Mar 24, 2011 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 11, 2018}}</ref>

In June 1999, [[Rite Aid]] entered into a ten-year strategic relationship with Drugstore.com which allowed Drugstore.com customers to pick up prescriptions at Rite Aid stores, and enabled Drugstore.com to sell Rite Aid products, as well as vitamins from retailer [[GNC (store)|General Nutrition Center]] (GNC). On September 3, 2008, Drugstore.com amended and restated both the main agreement and the pharmacy supply and services agreement dated June 17, 1999 between Rite Aid and Drugstore.com. Through those agreements with Rite Aid, Drugstore.com had access to Rite Aid customers through the RiteAid.com website and the Rite Aid online store, which was powered by the Drugstore.com website. Drugstore.com ended a sourcing deal with [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]] in 2005. In addition to the Drugstore.com website, the company also maintained storefronts at Beauty.com, VisionDirect.com, Lensmart.com, Lensworld.com, and Lensquest.com.

Its headquarters were at 411 108th Ave. NE, Suite 1600; Bellevue, WA 98004; (425) 372-3200, and the company had customer service centers in [[Bellevue, Washington]] and [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].

DS Distribution, Inc., located in the [[Pureland Industrial Complex]] in [[Logan Township, New Jersey]], was its wholly owned subsidiary responsible for the distribution of OTC products, beauty.com products, and CNS (Custom Nutrition Services) products. Distribution of VisionDirect.com products is from a center in [[Logan Township, New Jersey]]. Prescriptions were handled by Walgreens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugstore.com/templates/browse/default.asp?catid=292023|title=pharmacy services by Walgreens |work=drugstore.com|accessdate=11 December 2014}}{{dead link|date=October 2018}}</ref>

It had an "FSA store" containing items that are likely to be eligible for purchase using a medical [[flexible spending account]], and by extension a [[Health Reimbursement Account|health reimbursement account]] or [[health savings account]] as well. This in turn led to its invention of the first [[inventory information approval system]] (IIAS) in 2005; it wasn't used in brick-and-mortar retailing until 2006 by Walgreens. Under a 2006 [[Internal Revenue Service]] ruling, IIAS must be installed by every grocery store, [[discount store]], and Internet pharmacy that accepts [[FSA debit card]]s by the end of 2007, and by most chain pharmacies by the end of 2008.

On December 27, 2009, Drugstore.com announced plans to acquire Salu Inc., the operator of SkinStore.com, for $36 million.<ref name="Drugstore.com-Dec-2009-8-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2820/119312509260035/filing-main.htm |title=Drugstore.com, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Dec 28, 2009 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 11, 2018}}</ref> The transaction completed on February 19, 2010.<ref name="Drugstore.com-Feb-2010-8-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1862/119312510035818/filing-main.htm |title=Drugstore.com, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Feb 22, 2010 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 11, 2018}}</ref>

On March 24, 2011, Drugstore.com was acquired by Walgreens for $409 million.<ref>Robin Wauters, TechCrunch.

On July 28, 2016, Walgreens said it would shut down Drugstore.com and Beauty.com at the end of September, 2016, to focus on its own Walgreens.com website.<ref name=shutdown /><ref>Northwest Innovation, "[http://www.nwinnovation.com/drugstore_com_beauty_com_to_be_shut_down_by_walgreens/s-0066446.html Drugstore.com, Beauty.com To Be Shut Down By Walgreens]."
