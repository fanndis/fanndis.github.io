The '''Central Bank of Brazil''' ({{lang-pt|Banco Central do Brasil}}) is [[Brazil]]'s [[central bank]]. It was established on December 31, 1964.

The Central Bank is linked with the [[Ministry of the Economy (Brazil)|Ministry of the Economy]]. Like other central banks, the Brazilian central bank is the principal [[monetary]] authority of the country. It received this authority when it was founded by three different institutions: the {{ill|Bureau of Currency and Credit|pt|Superintendência da Moeda e do Crédito}} (SUMOC), the [[Bank of Brazil]] (BB), and the {{ill|National Treasury (Brazil)|pt|Tesouro Nacional|lt=National Treasury}}.

One of the main instruments of Brazil's [[monetary policy]] is the Banco Central do Brasil's [[overnight rate]], called the [[SELIC]] rate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Global|first=IndraStra|title=The Central Bank of Brazil Maintains Selic Rate at 6.5%|url=https://www.indrastra.com/2018/06/the-central-bank-of-brazil-maintains.html|journal=IndraStra|issn=2381-3652}}</ref> It is managed by Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) of the bank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcb.gov.br/en/#!/n/COMMITTEE|title=Banco Central do Brasil|website=www.bcb.gov.br|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref>

The bank is active in promoting [[financial inclusion]] policy and is a leading member of the [http://www.afi-global.org Alliance for Financial Inclusion].
