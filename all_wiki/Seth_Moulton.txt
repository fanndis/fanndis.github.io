'''Seth Wilbur Moulton''' (born October 24, 1978) is an American politician serving as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for [[Massachusetts's 6th congressional district]] since 2015. A former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] [[Military Officer|officer]], he is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

After graduating from [[Harvard University]] in 2001 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[physics]], Moulton joined the [[United States Marine Corps]].  He served four tours in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and then went on to earn his [[master's degree]]s in [[Master of Business Administration|business]] and [[Master of Public Policy|public policy]] in a [[Double degree|dual program]] at Harvard. He entered politics in 2014, running for Massachusetts's 6th congressional district, and won reelection in 2016 and 2018.

In early 2019, Moulton was seen as a potential presidential candidate for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic nomination]] in [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]].<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/05/01/seth-moulton-creating-buzz-about-presidential-bid/zxAxmueS0cnwGmfeK1hxwO/story.html | title = Speculation is stirring about a Seth Moulton presidential bid | first = Jim | last = O'Sullivan | date = May 2, 2017 | work = The Boston Globe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Mahaskey | first = M.

After graduating in 2002 with the rank of [[second lieutenant]], Moulton was among the first service members to enter [[Baghdad]] at the beginning of the [[Iraq War]].<ref name=madepeace/><ref name=warprofiles/>

==Military career==
During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Moulton led one of the first infantry platoons to enter [[Baghdad]]. He served a total of four tours of duty in [[Iraq]] from 2003 to 2008.<ref name=madepeace/> Moulton took part in the 2003 [[Battle of Nasiriyah]], leading a platoon that cleared a hostile stronghold. In that action, he went to the aid of a Marine wounded by friendly fire, and for his actions he was awarded the [[Commendation Medal|Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal]] for valor.<ref name=underplays>{{cite news | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/10/17/moulton-underplays-military-service/lY9FfmOrviwL2LAFHr61dO/story.html | title = Seth Moulton underplays military service | first = Walter V. | last = Robinson | date = October 18, 2014 | work = [[The Boston Globe]]}}</ref> Moulton was active in combat against insurgent forces in Iraq, including the 2004 [[Battle of Najaf (2004)|Battle of Najaf]] against the militia of [[Muqtada al-Sadr]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/316/No-End-in-Sight.html | work = [[PBS]] | date = April 20, 2007 | title = Director's Interview: Charles Ferguson}}</ref> Over two days, he "fearlessly exposed himself to enemy fire" as his platoon was pinned down under heavy fire and then directed the supporting fire that repelled the attack. He received the [[Bronze Star Medal]] for his actions in this battle.<ref name=underplays/>

He told only his campaign manager about these awards, keeping them secret even from his parents. When ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reporter [[Walter V. Robinson]] disclosed in October 2014 that Moulton had earned the Bronze Star and the Commendation Medal, Moulton said that "[t]here is a healthy disrespect among veterans who served on the front lines for people who walk around telling war stories". He said he was uncomfortable calling attention to his own awards out of respect to "many others who did heroic things and received no awards at all." He asked Robinson not to refer to him as a hero: "Look, we served our country, and we served the guys next to us. And it's not something to brag about." The ''Globe'' reported that "his voice choked with emotion" as he added: "The greatest honor of my life was to lead these men in my platoon, even though it was a war that I and they disagreed with."<ref name=underplays/>

In 2008, General [[David Petraeus]] requested that Moulton be assigned to work as a special liaison with tribal leaders in Southern Iraq during his fourth tour of duty in Iraq. Following that tour, Moulton was discharged from the Marine Corps with the rank of captain.<ref name=madepeace/><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2014/09/11/seth-moulton-97-wins-democratic-party-primary | title = Seth Moulton '97 Wins The Democratic Party Primary | first = Kailash | last = Sundaram | date = September 12, 2014 | work = [[Phillips Academy]]|url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141009220610/http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2014/09/11/seth-moulton-97-wins-democratic-party-primary | archivedate = October 9, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/05/11/marine-veteran-seth-moulton-wages-insurgent-campaign-against-fellow-democrat-john-tierney/3RdZyq5hE0o8QicDcNGVQO/story.html | title = Marine Veteran Seth Moulton Wages Insurgent Campaign Against Fellow Democrat John Tierney | work = [[Boston Globe]] | date = May 11, 2014 | first = Stephanie | last = Ebbert | accessdate = November 11, 2014}}</ref>

===Media contributions===
In 2003, Moulton co-hosted a television program with his Iraqi interpreter, Mohammed Harba, called "Moulton and Mohammed," during which they discussed regional conditions in the period following the U.S. invasion before an audience of U.S. servicemen and Iraqi citizens.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/programs/2007/01/06/moulton_amp_mohammed.html | title = Moulton & Mohammed | work = [[American Public Media]] | date = January 6, 2007|url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140924072653/http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/programs/2007/01/06/moulton_amp_mohammed.html | archivedate = September 24, 2014}}</ref> The show ended after three months when Moulton's unit left the area.<ref name=madepeace/>

Between 2003 and 2008, Moulton was frequently interviewed about his experiences as an officer in Iraq by U.S. national media, including CNN, MSNBC, and NPR programs ''[[Morning Edition]]'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]''.<ref name=madepeace/><ref name="NPR interviews">{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/search/index.php?searchinput=seth+moulton | title = Search Results:Seth Moulton}}</ref>

Moulton was also prominently featured in the 2007 Academy Award-nominated documentary ''[[No End in Sight]]''. In the film, Moulton criticized the U.S. government's handling of the [[History of Iraq (2003–11)|occupation of Iraq]]. [[UCLA]] anthropology professor [[Sherry Ortner]] wrote that Moulton's comments "sum[med] up the emotional tone of the film."<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Ortner | first1 = Sherry B. | title = Not Hollywood: Independent Film at the Twilight of the American Dream | date = 2013 | publisher = Duke University Press | isbn = 978-0822354260 | page = 245 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aIqdEw2VToUC&pg=PA245 | accessdate = November 11, 2014}}</ref>

==Private sector career==
Following his return from active duty with the Marines in 2008, Moulton attended a dual-degree program at the [[Harvard Business School]] and the [[John F.

In 2011, Moulton and a graduate school classmate founded Eastern Healthcare Partners, which Moulton has invoked to show he was a "successful entrepreneur" who understands "what it's like to face that day when you might not meet payroll." The company raised investor funds and drafted a partnership agreement with [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], but in October 2014 the ''Boston Globe'' reported that by the time Moulton ran for Congress, EHP had no revenue, was still incubating, and had closed its only Massachusetts office.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/10/23/small-businesses-are-sometimes-really-small/Xg1p3vOuopiBU8TUDHFlEO/story.html | title = Small businesses are sometimes . . . really small | website = BostonGlobe.com}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
====2012 speculation====
Moulton had considered running against Democratic Representative [[John F. Tierney]] of [[Massachusetts's 6th congressional district]] as an Independent in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Massachusetts, 2012#District 6|2012 elections]], but he decided against it in July 2012, saying that "the time and the logistics of putting together all the campaign infrastructure, organizing the volunteers ... the fundraising—it's just too much to accomplish in three months." Had he run and been elected, he would have caucused with the Democrats. He told ''Roll Call'' that his own polling "showed there was in fact a clear path to victory" and said he might run for office in the future.<ref>{{cite news | title = Massachusetts: Independent Seth Moulton Will Not Run | url = http://atr.rollcall.com/massachusetts-independent-seth-moulton-will-not-run | accessdate = October 8, 2014 | work = Roll Call | date = July 23, 2012}}</ref>

Moulton said that he opposed the Iraq War in which he served. A Tierney campaign staff member said that Moulton had "changed his mind" and highlighted Tierney's vote in Congress to oppose [[Iraq Resolution|the 2002 resolution authorizing the U.S. Invasion of Iraq]].<ref name=Iraqvote/> Moulton also received the first-ever political endorsement from [[Stanley McChrystal|Ret.

===2018 challenge to Nancy Pelosi===
Following the 2018 elections, Democrats had returned to being the majority party in the House of Representatives. Moulton and some others who felt current leadership was "too old," gathered signatures to replace Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) as the Democrats' leader. Rep. [[Karen Bass]] (D-CA) was their first choice as the person to take the leadership role from Pelosi.<ref name="WSJ20200731">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-considers-karen-bass-lawmaker-known-as-team-player-in-running-mate-search-11596215303 |title=Biden Considers Karen Bass, Lawmaker Known as Team Player, in Running-Mate Search |author1=Thomas, Ken |author2=Wise, Lindsay |work=WSJ |quote=In the days after the 2018 midterm elections, a small group of dissatisfied House Democrats searched for a challenger to the party’s leader, Nancy Pelosi.

===Marijuana===
Moulton has admitted to using [[marijuana]] and supports the [[Cannabis legalization|legalization]] of the drug, saying, "If you're not buying your marijuana from a dealer who sells heroin, who sells opioids, it's much less likely to be a gateway drug. The problem is now that it operates in the shadows. There's no control whatsoever. Someone goes and buys an edible, for example, there's no regulation about what's in that. It's like moonshine under Prohibition."<ref>{{cite news | first = Kyle Scott | last = Clauss | title = Seth Moulton Says He Smoked Pot at Harvard, Supports Legalization | url = http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2016/09/19/seth-moulton-smoked-pot-legalization | work = Boston Magazine | date = September 19, 2016 | accessdate = October 13, 2017}}</ref>

===Transportation policy===
Moulton is the driving force behind the [[North–South Rail Link|North-South Rail Link]], a project aimed at uniting Boston's north and south-side [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] lines, decongesting its subway lines, and linking the commuter rail to [[Logan International Airport]] via the Blue Line.

Moulton said that, in order to understand how an educated society "can elect a demagogue," voters should read about how the German people elected Hitler in the early 20th century.<ref name=rise>{{cite news | last = Andersen | first = Travis | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/03/23/congressman-seth-moulton-compares-rise-donald-trump-election-hitler/5nbZpv2d4B25N2A3hgOldP/story.html | title = Moulton compares Trump's rise to election of Hitler in 1930s | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | date = March 24, 2016 | accessdate = March 24, 2016}}</ref>

Moulton walked out of President Trump's State of the Union address in 2020 citing the portion of the president's address about the administration's contributions to the military and service members.

===Gun policy===
On June 15, 2016, Moulton appeared on the cover of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' with the statement "No Civilian Should Own This Gun" in reference to [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] "[[assault weapons]]". The cover pictures Moulton during a deployment to [[Iraq]], carrying an issued [[M4 carbine]].<ref>{{cite news | title = No Civilian Should Own This Weapon | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nydn-front-pages-2016-gallery-1.2482879?pmSlide=1.2674384 | accessdate = June 17, 2016 | agency = New York Daily News | date = June 15, 2016}}</ref> The particular gun in the picture has never been legal for civilians to own due to the [[Firearm Owners Protection Act#Ban on new automatic firearms|Hughes Amendment]] in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Moulton penned an opinion piece promoting gun control, including the statement: "There's simply no reason for a civilian to own a military-style assault weapon.
