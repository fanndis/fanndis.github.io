==Early life and education==

Gerald Gunther was born on May 26, 1927, in Usingen im Taunus, Germany, where his family had worked as butchers for over three centuries.<ref name=StanfordReport/> Gunther entered primary school during the same year in which [[Adolf Hitler]] gained power. In school, Gunther experienced virulent anti-Semitism; a Nazi schoolteacher labeled Gunther "Jew-pig" and segregated him from his classmates.<ref name=GeraldGunther>Casper, Gerhard.

Retrieved 28 June 2015.</ref> Though initially hesitant to leave Germany, Gunther's family fled for the United States in 1938, only a few hours after witnessing the destruction of their town synagogue.<ref name=NYTimes>Goldman, Ari. [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/01/us/gerald-gunther-legal-scholar-dies-at-75.html "Gerald Gunther, Legal Scholar, Dies at 75"]. ''The New York Times''. 1 August 2002. Retrieved 28 June 2015.</ref> Upon arriving in America, Gunther's family settled in Brooklyn, New York.<ref name=StanfordReport/>

Gunther attended [[Brooklyn College]], where he graduated with an A.B. in 1949.<ref name=StanfordNews>[http://news.stanford.edu/pr/95/950328Arc5306.html "Gerald Gunther, law professor, honored by Duquesne University"]. Stanford News Service. 28 March 1995. Retrieved 28 June 2015.</ref> He then received an M.A. in public law and government from [[Columbia University]] in 1950 and an LL.B., magna cum laude, from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1953, where he was an editor of the ''Harvard Law Review''.<ref name=StanfordReport/><ref name=StanfordNews/>

==Career==

From 1953 to 1954, following his graduation from Harvard, Gunther clerked for Judge [[Learned Hand]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], and from 1954 to 1955, for [[Chief Justice Earl Warren]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]]. As later revealed by Warren, Gunther played a central role in the writing of the Court's landmark ruling in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] (II).<ref name=NYTimes/>

After a year in private practice at a Wall Street law firm, Gunther joined the faculty of [[Columbia Law School]] in 1956.<ref name=NYTimes/> At Columbia, Gunther mentored future [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], who graduated from Columbia Law School in 1959. According to Ginsburg, Gunther helped to secure her clerkship with Judge [[Edmund L. Palmieri]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] "by pressuring every judge in the Southern District" to hire her.<ref name=NYTimes/> Gunther also advised Ginsburg on how to broaden constitutional protections to women when she was a lawyer with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]],<ref name=NYTimes/> and in July 1993, Gunther testified for Ginsburg at her Senate confirmation hearings.<ref name=StanfordReport/>

In 1962, Gunther left Columbia for Stanford Law School, where he became the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law in 1972, taking emeritus status in 1995 (though he continued to teach until his death).<ref name=StanfordReport/> At Stanford, Gunther, who was motivated by his childhood experiences in Nazi Germany, became an outspoken defender of civil liberties, particularly the right to freedom of speech.<ref name=LATimes>Luna, Claire. [http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/02/local/me-gunther2 "Gerald Gunther, 75; Stanford Law Lecturer, Scholar"] ''Los Angeles Times''. 2 August 2002. Retrieved 28 June 2015.</ref> In 1976, Gunther famously defended the freedom of speech rights of American Nazis,<ref name=LATimes/> and in 1988, Gunther opposed a Stanford University ban on expressions of racial or religious intolerance.<ref name=GeraldGunther/> Recalling his own experiences with anti-Semitism, Gunther spoke of "the need to walk the sometimes difficult path of denouncing the bigot’s hateful ideas with all my power, yet at the same time challenging any community’s attempt to suppress hateful ideas by force of law."<ref name=GeraldGunther/>

In addition to his prolific scholarship on constitutional law, first amendment law, and the U.S. Supreme Court, Gunther spent 22 years researching and writing his influential 818-page biography of Judge Learned Hand, titled ''Learned Hand: The Man and the Judge''.<ref name=NYTimes/><ref name=LATimes/> Gunther's biography earned him numerous awards, including the Triennial Book Award of the Order of the Coif and the Erwin N. Griswold Triennial Prize from the Supreme Court Historical Society.<ref name=StanfordReport/>

Gunther was ultimately awarded five honorary degrees, as well as the Learned Hand Medal for Excellence in Federal Jurisprudence from the Federal Bar Council in 1988, the Richard J. Maloney Prize for Distinguished Contributions to Legal Education from the Order of the Coif in 1990, and the Bernard E. Witkin Medal from the State Bar of California in 1995.<ref name=StanfordReport/> In 1987, in a survey of lawyers conducted by the ''[[National Law Journal]]'', Gunther was voted as the most qualified candidate for the United States Supreme Court.<ref name=NYTimes/>

Gunther is played by Ronald Guttman in the film ''[[On the Basis of Sex]]'' (2018). The scene has Gunther playing a Tenth Circuit judge in a [[moot court]] to prepare Ruth Bader Ginsburg for an oral argument in ''[[Moritz v. Commissioner]]''.<ref>https://openjurist.org/469/f2d/466/moritz-v-commissioner-of-internal-</ref>
