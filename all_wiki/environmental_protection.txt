{{short description|The practice of protecting the natural environment}}
'''Environmental protection''' is the practice of protecting the [[natural environment]] by individuals, organizations and governments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/environmental-protection|title=Environmental-protection dictionary definition {{!}} environmental-protection defined|website=yourdictionary.com|access-date=2018-11-21}}</ref> Its objectives are to conserve natural resources and the existing natural environment and, where possible, to repair damage and reverse trends.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thelawdictionary.org/environmental-protection/|title=What is Environmental Protection? definition of Environmental Protection (Black's Law Dictionary)|date=2012-10-19|work=The Law Dictionary|access-date=2018-11-21}}</ref>

Due to the pressures of [[overconsumption]], [[population growth]] and technology, the [[environment (biophysical)|biophysical environment]] is being degraded, sometimes permanently. This has been recognized, and governments have begun placing restraints on activities that cause [[environmental degradation]]. Since the 1960s, [[environmental movement]]s have created more awareness of the multiple [[environmental problem]]s. There is disagreement on the extent of the [[Human impact on the environment|environmental impact of human activity]], so protection measures are occasionally debated.

== Approaches to environmental protection ==

===Voluntary environmental agreements===
In the industrial countries, voluntary environmental agreements often provide a platform for companies to be recognized for moving beyond the minimum regulatory standards and thus support the development of the best environmental practice. For instance, in India, Environment Improvement Trust (EIT) has been working for environmental and forest protection since 1998. A group of Green Volunteers gets a goal of Green India Clean India concept. CA Gajendra Kumar Jain a Chartered Accountant, is the founder of Environment Improvement Trust in Sojat city a small village of State of Rajasthan in India <ref>Karamanos, P., Voluntary Environmental Agreements: Evolution and Definition of a New Environmental Policy Approach. Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, 2001. 44(1): p. 67-67-84.</ref> In developing countries, such as Latin America, these agreements are more commonly used to remedy significant levels of non-compliance with mandatory regulation.

===Ecosystems approach===
An [[ecosystem]]s approach to resource management and environmental protection aims to consider the complex interrelationships of an entire ecosystem in decision making rather than simply responding to specific issues and challenges. Ideally, the decision-making processes under such an approach would be a collaborative approach to planning and decision making that involves a broad range of stakeholders across all relevant governmental departments, as well as industry representatives, environmental groups, and community. This approach ideally supports a better exchange of information, development of conflict-resolution strategies and improved regional conservation. Religions also play an important role in the conservation of the environment.<ref>{{cite web|title=An ecosystem approach to natural resource conservation in California|url=http://www.interenvironment.org/cipa/ecosystemapproach.htm|work=CIPA Publication No. 106|publisher=InterEnvironment Institute|access-date=10 July 2012|author=The California Institute of Public Affairs (CIPA)|date=August 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402223955/http://www.interenvironment.org/cipa/ecosystemapproach.htm|archive-date=2012-04-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===International environmental agreements===
[[File:Kyoto Protocol Commitment map 2010.png|thumb|Kyoto Protocol Commitment map 2010|321x321px]]
Many of the earth's resources are especially vulnerable because they are influenced by human impacts across '''different countries'''. As a result of this, many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources. This can include agreements that impact factors such as climate, oceans, rivers and air pollution. These international environmental agreements are sometimes legally binding documents that have legal implications when they are not followed and, at other times, are more agreements in principle or are for use as codes of conduct. These agreements have a long history with some multinational agreements being in place from as early as 1910 in Europe, America and Africa.<ref>Mitchell, R.B., International Environmental Agreements: A Survey of Their Features, Formation, and Effects. Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 2003. 28(1543-5938, 1543-5938): p. 429-429-461.</ref> 

Many of the international technical agencies formed after 1945 addressed environmental themes. By the late 1960s, a growing environmental movement called for coordinated and institutionalized international cooperation. The landmark [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] was held in Stockholm in 1972. It was followed by the creation of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] later that year.<ref>Iriss Borowy, "Before UNEP: who was in charge of the global environment? The struggle for institutional responsibility 1968–72." ''Journal of Global History'' 14.1 (2019): 87-106.</ref>

Some of the most well-known international agreements include the [[Kyoto Protocol]] of 1997 and the [[Paris Agreement]] of 2015.

==Government==

Discussion concerning environmental protection often focuses on the role of government, legislation, and law enforcement. However, in its broadest sense, environmental protection may be seen to be the responsibility of all the people and not simply that of government. Decisions that impact the environment will ideally involve a broad range of stakeholders including industry, indigenous groups, environmental group and community representatives. Gradually, environmental decision-making processes are evolving to reflect this broad base of stakeholders and are becoming more collaborative in many countries.<ref>Harding, R., Ecologically sustainable development: origins, implementation and challenges. Desalination, 2006. 187(1-3): p. 229-239</ref>

Many constitutions acknowledge [[Tanzania]] is recognised as having some of the greatest biodiversity of any African country. Almost 40% of the land has been established into a network of protected areas, including several national parks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biodiversity and Protected Areas-- Tanzania|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/klimostoolkit/sites/default/files/documents/tanzania_bd.pdf|work=Earth Trends Country Profiles|publisher=Vrije Universiteit Brussel|access-date=10 July 2012|author=Earth Trends|year=2003}}</ref> The concerns for the natural environment include damage to ecosystems and loss of habitat resulting from population growth, expansion of subsistence agriculture, pollution, timber extraction and significant use of timber as fuel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tanzania – Environmental Policy Brief|url=http://www.tzdpg.or.tz/uploads/media/SIDA_env_pol_brief.pdf|publisher=Development Partners Group Tanzania|access-date=10 July 2012|author=Jessica Andersson|author2=Daniel Slunge|date=16 June 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710183811/http://www.tzdpg.or.tz/uploads/media/SIDA_env_pol_brief.pdf|archive-date=2012-07-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== History of environmental protection ===
Environmental protection in Tanzania began during the German occupation of East Africa (1884-1919) — colonial conservation laws for the protection of game and forests were enacted, whereby restrictions were placed upon traditional indigenous activities such as hunting, firewood collecting, and cattle grazing.<ref>Goldstein, G., Legal System and Wildlife Conservation: History and the Law's Effect on Indigenous People and Community Conservation in Tanzania, The. Georgetown International Environmental Law Review, 2005. Georgetown University Law Center (Spring).</ref> In the year 1948, Serengeti has officially established the first national park for wild cats in East Africa. Since 1983, there has been a more broad-reaching effort to manage environmental issues at a national level, through the establishment of the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) and the development of an environmental act. In 1998 Environment Improvement Trust (EIT) start working for environment & forest protection in India from a small city Sojat. Founder of Environment Improvement Trust is CA Gajendra Kumar Jain working with volunteers.<ref name=TanLaw>Pallangyo, D.M. (2007). "Environmental Law in Tanzania; How Far Have We Gone?".LEAD: Law, Environment & Development Journal 3 (1).</ref>

=== Government protection ===
Division of the biosphere is the main government body that oversees protection. It does this through the formulation of policy, coordinating and monitoring environmental issues, environmental planning and policy-oriented environmental research. The National Environment Management Council (NEMC) is an institution that was initiated when the National Environment Management Act was first introduced in year 1983. This council has the role to advise governments and the international community on a range of environmental issues. The NEMC the following purposes: provide technical advice; coordinate technical activities; develop enforcement guidelines and procedures; assess, monitor and evaluate activities that impact the environment; promote and assist environmental information and communication; and seek advancement of scientific knowledge.<ref name=TanGov>Tanzania Government. "Environment Tanzania". Tanzania Government. Retrieved 20/9/2011.</ref>

The National Environment Policy of 1997 acts as a framework for environmental decision making in Tanzania. The policy objectives are to achieve the following:
* Ensure sustainable and equitable use of resources without degrading the environment or risking health or safety.
* Prevent and control degradation of land, water, vegetation and air
* Conserve and enhance natural and man-made heritage, including biological diversity of unique ecosystems
* Improve condition and productivity of degraded areas[[File:Longwanqun national forest park creek 2011 07 25.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Longwanqun National Forest Park]] is a nationally protected nature area in Huinan County, Jilin, China|409x409px]]
* Raise awareness and understanding of the link between environment and development
* Promote individual and community participation
* Promote international cooperation<ref name=TanGov />
* Use ecofriendly resources.
Tanzania is a signatory to a significant number of international conventions including the Rio Declaration on Development and Environment 1992 and the Convention on Biological Diversity 1996. The Environmental Management Act, 2004, is the first comprehensive legal and institutional framework to guide environmental-management decisions. The policy tools that are parts of the act include the use of environmental-impact assessments, strategics environmental assessments, and taxation on pollution for specific industries and products. The effectiveness of shifting of this act will only become clear over time as concerns regarding its implementation become apparent based on the fact that, historically, there has been a lack of capacity to enforce environmental laws and a lack of working tools to bring environmental-protection objectives into practice.

===China===
Formal environmental protection in China House was first stimulated by the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] held in Stockholm, Sweden. Following this, they began establishing environmental protection agencies and putting controls on some of its industrial waste. China was one of the first developing countries to implement a sustainable development strategy. In 1983 the State Council announced that environmental protection would be one of China's basic national policies and in 1984 the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) was established. Following severe flooding of the Yangtze River basin in 1998, NEPA was upgraded to the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) meaning that environmental protection was now being implemented at a ministerial level. In 2008, SEPA became known by its current name of [[Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China]] (MEP).<ref name=zhang08>{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Kunmin|author2=Wen, Peng|title=Review on environmental policies in China: Evolvement, features, and evaluation|journal=Environ.

Environmental pollution and ecological degradation has resulted in economic losses for China. In 2005, economic losses (mainly from air pollution) were calculated at 7.7% of China's GDP. This grew to 10.3% by 2002 and the economic loss from water pollution (6.1%) began to exceed that caused by air pollution.<ref name=zhangwen08>{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Kun-min|author2=Wen, Zong-guo.|title=Review and challenges of policies of environmental protection and sustainable development in China|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|year=2008|volume=88|issue=4|pages=1249–1261|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2007.06.019|pmid=17767999}}</ref>
China has been one of the top performing countries in terms of GDP growth (9.64% in the past ten years).<ref name="zhangwen08"/> However, the high economic growth has put immense pressure on its environment and the environmental challenges that China faces are greater than most countries. In 2010 China was ranked 121st out of 163 countries on the [[Environmental Performance Index]].

China has taken initiatives to increase its protection of the environment and combat environmental degradation:
* China's investment in renewable energy grew 18% in 2007 to $15.6 billion, accounting for ~10% of the global investment in this area;<ref name=chunmei10>{{cite journal|last=Chunmei|first=Wang|author2=Zhaolan, Lin.|title=Environmental Policies in China over the past 10 Years: Progress, Problems and Prospects|journal=International Society for Environmental Information Sciences 2010 Annual Conference (ISEIS)|year=2010|volume=2|pages=1701–1712|doi=10.1016/j.proenv.2010.10.181|doi-access=free}}</ref>
* In 2008, spending on the environment was 1.49% of GDP, up 3.4 times from 2000;<ref name=chunmei10 />
* The discharge of CO (carbon monoxide) and SO2 (sulfur dioxide) decreased by 6.61% and 8.95% in 2008 compared with that in 2005;<ref name=chunmei10 />
* China's protected nature reserves have increased substantially. In 1978 there were only 34 compared with 2,538 in 2010. The protected nature reserve system now occupies 15.5% of the country; this is higher than the world average.<ref name=chunmei10 />

Rapid growth in GDP has been China's main goal during the past three decades with a dominant development model of inefficient resource use and high pollution to achieve high GDP. For China to develop sustainably, environmental protection should be treated as an integral part of its economic policies.<ref name=Liu08>{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Jianguo|author2=Diamond, Jared.|title=Revolutionizing China's Environmental Protection|journal=Science|year=2008|volume=319|issue=5859|doi=10.1126/science.1150416|pages=37–38|pmid=18174421|s2cid=2903206}}</ref>

Quote from Shengxian Zhou, head of MEP (2009): "Good economic policy is good environmental policy and the nature of environmental problem is the economic structure, production form and develop model."<ref name=chunmei10 />

===European Union===
Environmental protection has become an important task for the institutions of the [[European Community]] after the [[Maastricht Treaty]] for the [[European Union]] ratification by all of its member states. The EU is active in the field of environmental policy, issuing directives such as those on [[environmental impact assessment]] and on [[access to environmental information]] for citizens in the member states.

===Ireland===
The [[Environmental Protection Agency, Ireland]] (EPA)
The EPA has a wide range of functions to protect the environment, with its primary responsibilities including:<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://eponline.com/Articles/List/All-Articles.aspx |title = News and Articles -}}</ref>{{complete citation needed|date=August 2019|reason=Not a source, just a pointer to a list of articles most of which have nothing to do with EPA-Ireland.}}

* Environmental planning, education, and guidance
* Monitoring, analyzing and reporting on the environment
* Regulating Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions
* Environmental research development
* Strategic environmental assessment
* [[Waste management]]
* [[Nuclear waste|Radiological]] protection

===Middle East===
The Middle Eastern countries become part of the joint Islamic environmental action, which was initiated in 2002 in [[Jeddah]]. Under the [[Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]], the member states join the Islamic Environment Ministers Conference in every two years, focusing on the importance of environment protection and [[sustainable development]]. The Arab countries are also awarded the title of best environment management in the Islamic world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.isesco.org.ma/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/final-report-7icem.pdf|title=7th Islamic Conference of Environment Ministers|access-date=25 October 2017|publisher=ISESCO}}</ref>

===Russia===
In [[Russia]], environmental protection is considered an integral part of national [[safety]]. There is an authorized state body, the Federal Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology. However, there are a lot of [[environmental issues in Russia]].

===Latin America===
[[File:Top 5 Countries by biological diversity.jpg|thumb|right|600px|Top 5 Countries by biological diversity]]
The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) has identified 17 [[megadiverse countries]]. The list includes six Latin American countries: [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]]. [[Mexico]] and [[Brazil]] stand out among the rest because they have the largest area, population and number of species. These countries represent a major concern for environmental protection because they have high rates of deforestation, ecosystems loss, pollution, and population growth.

====Brazil====
[[File:Foz de Iguaçu 27 Panorama Nov 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Panorama of the [[Iguazu falls]] in Brazil|621x621px]]
[[Brazil]] has the largest amount of the world's tropical forests, 4,105,401&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (48.1% of Brazil), concentrated in the Amazon region.<ref>Ministério do Meio Ambiente (MMA) Secretaria de Biodiversidade e Florestas (2002), ' Biodiversidade Brasileira', http://www.biodiversidade.rs.gov.br/arquivos/BiodiversidadeBrasileira_MMA.pdf, retrieved September 2011</ref> Brazil is home to vast biological diversity, first among the [[megadiverse countries]] of the world, having between 15%-20% of the 1.5 million globally described species.<ref>Lewinsohn, T. M.; Prado, P. I. (2004) 'Biodiversidade Brasileira: Síntese do Estado Atual do Conhecimento', Contexto Academico</ref>

The organization in charge of environment protection is the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (in Portuguese: Ministério do Meio Ambiente, MMA).<ref>{{cite web|title=Ministério do Meio Ambiente|url=http://www.mma.gov.br/sitio/|publisher=Ministério do Meio Ambiente|access-date=10 July 2012|author=Ministério do Meio Ambiente|language=Portuguese|year=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302154545/http://www.mma.gov.br/sitio/|archive-date=2012-03-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was first created in the year 1973 with the name Special Secretariat for the Environment (Secretaria Especial de Meio Ambiente), changing names several times, and adopting the final name in the year 1999. The Ministry is responsible for addressing the following issues:
* A national policy for the environment and for water resources;
* A policy for the preservation, conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems, biodiversity, and forests;
* Proposing strategies, mechanisms, economic and social instruments for improving environmental quality, and sustainable use of natural resources;
* Policies for integrating production and the environment;
* Environmental policies and programs for the Legal Amazon;
* Ecological and economic territorial zoning.

In 2011, protected areas of the Amazon covered 2,197,485&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (an area larger than Greenland), with conservation units, like national parks, accounting for just over half (50.6%) and indigenous territories representing the remaining 49.4%.<ref>Veríssimo, A., Rolla, A., Vedoveto, M. & de Furtada, S.M.

====Mexico====
With over 200,000 different species, [[Mexico]] is home to 10–12% of the world's biodiversity, ranking first in [[reptile]] biodiversity and second in [[mammals]]<ref>Mittermeier, R. y C. Goettsch (1992) 'La importancia de la diversidad biológica de México', Conabio, México</ref>—one estimate indicates that over 50% of all animal and plant species live in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|title=Principal ecosystems in Mexico|url=http://www.vivanatura.org/Maps%20Mexican%20ecosystems.html|work=Viva Natura|publisher=Viva Natura|access-date=10 July 2012|author=Viva Natura}}</ref>

The history of environmental policy in Mexico started in the 1940s with the enactment of the Law of Conservation of Soil and Water (in Spanish: Ley de Conservación de Suelo y Agua). Three decades later, at the beginning of the 1970s, the Law to Prevent and Control Environmental Pollution was created (Ley para Prevenir y Controlar la Contaminación Ambiental).

In the year 1972 was the first direct response from the federal government to address eminent health effects from environmental issues. It established the administrative organization of the Secretariat for the Improvement of the Environment (Subsecretaría para el Mejoramiento del Ambiente) in the Department of Health and Welfare.

[[File:Axolote.jpg|thumb|left|The [[axolotl]] is an endemic species from the central part of Mexico ]]
The Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, [[SEMARNAT]]<ref>Official site: http://www.semarnat.gob.mx/</ref>) is Mexico's environment ministry. The Ministry is responsible for addressing the following issues:
* Promote the protection, restoration, and conservation of ecosystems, natural resources, goods, and environmental services and facilitate their use and sustainable development.
* Develop and implement a national policy on natural resources
* Promote environmental management within the national territory, in coordination with all levels of government and the private sector.
* Evaluate and provide determination to the environmental impact statements for development projects and prevention of ecological damage
* Implement national policies on climate change and protection of the ozone layer.
* Direct work and studies on national meteorological, climatological, hydrological, and geohydrological systems, and participate in international conventions on these subjects.
* Regulate and monitor the conservation of waterways

In November 2000 there were 127 [[protected areas]]; currently there are 174, covering an area of 25,384,818 hectares, increasing federally protected areas from 8.6% to 12.85% its land area.<ref>Official site: http://www.conanp.gob.mx/</ref>

There are several Commonwealth protected lands due to partnerships with traditional native owners, such as [[Kakadu National Park]], extraordinary biodiversity such as [[Christmas Island National Park]], or managed cooperatively due to cross-state location, such as the [[Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves]].<ref name="CW parks">{{cite web|title=Protected areas|url=http://australia.gov.au/topics/environment-and-natural-resources/environmental-protection/protected-areas|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|access-date=21 September 2011}}</ref>

At a state level, the bulk of environmental protection issues are left to the responsibility of the state or territory.<ref name="council BG" /><ref name="EPBC 2" /> Each state in Australia has its own environmental protection legislation and corresponding agencies. Their jurisdiction is similar and covers point-source pollution, such as from industry or commercial activities, land/water use, and waste management. Most protected lands are managed by states and territories<ref name="CW parks" /> with state legislative acts creating different degrees and definitions of protected areas such as wilderness, national land and marine parks, state forests, and conservation areas. States also create regulation to limit and provide general protection from air, water, and sound pollution.

At a local level, each city or regional council has responsibility over issues not covered by state or national legislation. This includes non-point source, or diffuse pollution, such as sediment pollution from construction sites.

The environmental protection in Switzerland is mainly based on the measures to be taken against global warming. The pollution in Switzerland is mainly the pollution caused by vehicles and the litteration by tourists.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===United States===
[[File:YosemitePark2 amk.jpg|thumb|[[Yosemite National Park]] in [[California]], one of the first protected areas in the United States.]]
Since 1969, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has been working to protect the environment and human health.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/epahome/aboutepa.htm The United States Environmental Protection Agency.] Retrieved on (August 23, 2008). "About Us (section)". U.S. EPA.</ref>

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is an independent public body under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Climate Action & Environment established under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.

All US states have their own state-level departments of environmental protection,<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/epahome/state.htm "State Environmental Agencies"]. [http://www.epa.gov United States Environmental Protection Agency]. Accessed May 2010.</ref> which may issue regulations more stringent than the federal ones.

In January 2010, EPA Administrator [[Lisa P. Jackson]] published via the official EPA blog her "Seven Priorities for EPA's Future", which were (in the order originally listed):<ref name="priorities">[http://blog.epa.gov/administrator/2010/01/12/seven-priorities-for-epas-future/ "Seven Priorities for EPA's Future"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818135203/http://blog.epa.gov/administrator/2010/01/12/seven-priorities-for-epas-future/ |date=2012-08-18}}.

{{As of|2019|post=,}} it is unclear whether these still represent the agency's active priorities, as Jackson departed in February 2013, and the page has not been updated in the interim.

===India===
The Constitution of India has a number of provisions demarcating the responsibility of the Central and State governments towards Environmental Protection. The state's responsibility with regard to environmental protection has been laid down under article 48-A of our constitution which stated that " The states shall endeavor to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forest and wildlife of the country".<ref>{{Cite wikisource
 | title = Constitution of India/Part IV
 | last = The Government of India
}}</ref>

Environmental protection has been made a fundamental duty of every citizen of India under Article 51-A (g) of the constitution which says "It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures".<ref>{{Cite Wikisource
 | title = Constitution of India/Part IVA
 | last = The Government of India
}}</ref>

Article 21 of the constitution is a fundamental right, which states that "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law".<ref>{{Cite wikisource

==In literature==
There are numerous works of literature that contain the themes of environmental protection but some have been fundamental to its evolution. Several pieces such as ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' by [[Aldo Leopold]], "[[Tragedy of the commons]]" by [[Garrett Hardin]], and ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]] have become classics due to their far reaching influences. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The subject of environmental protection is present in fiction as well as non-fictional literature. Books such as ''[[Antarctica (novel)|Antarctica]]'' and ''[[Blockade (novel)|Blockade]]'' have environmental protection as subjects whereas ''[[The Lorax]]'' has become a popular metaphor for environmental protection. "The Limits of Trooghaft"<ref name=troog>{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Desmond|title=The Limits of Trooghaft|journal=Encounter|date=February 1972|volume=38|issue=2|pages=3–7|url=http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/stewart01.htm|access-date=24 September 2011|location=London}}</ref> by Desmond Stewart is a short story that provides insight into human attitudes towards animals. Another book called ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' by [[Ray Bradbury]] investigates issues such as bombs, wars, government control, and what effects these can have on the environment.
