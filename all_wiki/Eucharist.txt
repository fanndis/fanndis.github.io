{{Eucharist}}

The '''Eucharist''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|k|ər|ɪ|s|t}}; also known as '''Holy Communion''' and the '''Lord's Supper'''<!-- Along with "Eucharist" these two names are the most common and should appear here. Do not add other names to the lead --> among other names) is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[rite]] that is considered a [[sacrament]] in most churches, and as an [[Ordinance (Christianity)|ordinance]] in others. According to the [[New Testament]], the rite was instituted by [[Jesus Christ]] during the [[Last Supper]]; giving his disciples bread and wine during a [[Passover]] meal, Jesus commanded his disciples to "do this in memory of me" while referring to the bread as "my body" and the cup of wine as "the new covenant in my blood".<ref>{{bibleref2|Luke 22:20}}</ref><!--Do not capitalise pronouns--><ref name="EB" /><ref>Ignazio Silone, ''Bread and Wine'' (1937).</ref> Through the eucharistic celebration [[Christians]]<!--link to Christians as a people, not Christianity the religion--> remember both [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's sacrifice]] of himself on the cross and his commission of the apostles at the Last Supper.<ref name="Methcat">{{cite book|title=A Catechism for the use of people called Methodists|date=2000|publisher=Methodist Publishing House|location=Peterborough, England|isbn=978-1858521824|page=26}}</ref>

The elements of the Eucharist, [[sacramental bread]] ([[Leavened bread|leavened]] or [[Unleavened bread|unleavened]]) and [[sacramental wine]] (or [[grape juice]] in denominations that do not allow the consumption of alcohol), are consecrated on an [[altar]] (or a [[communion table]]) and consumed thereafter. Communicants, those who consume the elements, may speak of "receiving the Eucharist" as well as "celebrating the Eucharist".<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|title=Christianity: Eucharist|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ritesrituals/eucharist_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 May 2017|date=23 June 2009}}</ref> Christians generally recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite, though they differ about exactly how, where, and when Christ is present.<ref name="BBC" /> While all agree that there is no perceptible change in the elements (e.g. color, taste, feel, and smell), [[Catholics]] believe that their [[Substance theory|substances]] actually become the body, blood, soul and divinity of Christ ([[transubstantiation]]) while the appearances or "species" of the elements remain. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodox]] churches agree that an objective change occurs of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, but vary in their use of transubstantiation as a name for the change. [[Lutherans]] believe the true body and blood of Christ are really present "in, with, and under" the forms of the bread and wine ([[sacramental union]]).<ref name="MattoxRoeber2012">{{cite book|last1=Mattox|first1=Mickey L.|last2=Roeber|first2=A.

They are at the same time body and blood, bread and wine. This divine food is given, more-over, not just for the strengthening of faith, nor only as a sign of our unity in faith, nor merely as an assurance of the forgiveness of sin. Even more, in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith. The "real presence" of Christ in the Holy Sacrament is the means by which the union of faith, effected by God's Word and the sacrament of baptism, is strengthened and maintained. Intimate union with Christ, in other words, leads directly to the most intimate communion in his holy body and blood.}}</ref> [[Calvinism|Reformed Christians]] believe in a [[Lord's Supper in Reformed theology|real spiritual presence]] of Christ in the Eucharist.<ref name="McKim1998">{{cite book|last=McKim|first=Donald K.|title=Major Themes in the Reformed Tradition|date=11 March 1998|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781579101046|page=263}}</ref> Anglican [[eucharistic theology|eucharistic theologies]] universally affirm the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], though [[Evangelical Anglicanism|Evangelical Anglicans]] believe that this is a spiritual presence, while [[Anglo-Catholic]]s hold to a [[wikt:corporeal|corporeal]] presence.<ref name="Poulson1999">{{cite book|last=Poulson|first=Christine|title=The Quest for the Grail: Arthurian Legend in British Art, 1840-1920|year=1999|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719055379|page=40|quote=By the late 1840s Anglo-Catholic interest in the revival of ritual had given new life to doctrinal debate over the nature of the Eucharist.

In spite of differences among Christians about various aspects of the Eucharist, there is, according to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "more of a consensus among Christians about the meaning of the Eucharist than would appear from the confessional debates over the sacramental presence, the effects of the Eucharist, and the proper auspices under which it may be celebrated".<ref name="EB">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033174/Eucharist |title=Encyclopædia Britannica, s.v.

[[Latter-day Saints]] call it "[[Sacrament (LDS Church)|the sacrament]]".<ref name="LDS_Sacrament"/>

===Lord's Supper===
{{anchor|Supper}}
The Lord's Supper, in Greek {{lang|grc|Κυριακὸν δεῖπνον}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Kyriakon deipnon}}), was in use in the early 50s of the 1st century,<ref name=LaV/><ref name=Schr/> as witnessed by the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:20|11:20–21]]): 
<blockquote>When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk.</blockquote> 
It is the predominant term among [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]], such as [[Baptists]] and [[Pentecostals]].<ref>Christopher A. Stephenson, ''Types of Pentecostal Theology: Method, System, Spirit'', OUP US, 2012, p. 123</ref><ref>Roger E. Olson, ''The Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology'', Westminster John Knox Press, UK, 2004, p. 259</ref><ref>Edward E. Hindson, Daniel R. Mitchell, ''The Popular Encyclopedia of Church History: The People, Places, and Events That Shaped Christianity'', Harvest House Publishers, US, 2013, p. 371</ref> They also refer to the observance as an [[Ordinance (Christianity)|ordinance]] rather than a sacrament.

[[File:Last-supper-from-Kremikovtsi.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]] fresco (15th century) depicting the [[Last Supper]] celebrated by Jesus and his disciples. The early Christians too would have celebrated this meal to commemorate Jesus' death and subsequent resurrection.]]

===Communion===
{{anchor|Communion}}
Use of the term ''Communion'' (or ''Holy Communion'') to refer to the Eucharistic rite began by some groups originating in the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Others, such as the Catholic Church, do not formally use this term for the rite, but instead mean by it the act of partaking of the consecrated elements;<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.ocp.org/en-us/blog/entry/music/holy-communion-eucharist|author=Jethro Higgins|title=Holy Communion: What is the Eucharist?|publisher=Oregon Catholic Press|year=2018}}</ref> they speak of receiving Holy Communion even outside of the rite, and of participating in the rite without receiving [[First Communion]]. The term ''Communion'' is derived from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''communio'' ("sharing in common"), which translates Greek κοινωνία (''koinōnía'') in {{bibleref2|1cor|10:16||1 Corinthians 10:16}}:<blockquote> The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the ''communion'' of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the ''communion'' of the body of Christ?</blockquote>

===Other terms===
====Breaking of bread====
The phrase {{lang|grc|κλάσις τοῦ ἄρτου}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|klasis tou artou}} 'breaking of the bread'; in later liturgical Greek also {{lang|grc|ἀρτοκλασία}} {{lang|grc-Latn|artoklasia}}) appears in various related forms five times in the New Testament ({{Bibleref2|Luke|24:35}}; {{Bibleref2|Acts|2:42}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|2:46}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|20:7}} and {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|20:11}}) in contexts which, according to some, may refer to the celebration of the Eucharist, in either closer or symbolically more distant reference to the Last Supper.<ref>{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Alan |title=Introduction to the Theology of the New Testament |year=1958 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoth00rich |url-access=registration |location=London |publisher=[[SCM Press]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoth00rich/page/364 364]}}</ref> It is the term used by the [[Plymouth Brethren]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church; Nature| editor1-last=Cross| editor1-first=F.

====Sacrament or Blessed Sacrament====
The "[[Blessed Sacrament]]", the "Sacrament of the Altar", and other variations, are common terms used by Catholics,<ref>{{CCC|pp=1330}}</ref> Lutherans<ref>{{cite web |title=Small Catechism (6): The Sacrament of the Altar |url=http://www.christlutheranchurch.org.uk/site/2007/06/23/small-catechism-6-the-sacrament-of-the-altar/ |publisher=Christ Lutheran Church |accessdate=24 June 2020}}</ref> and some Anglicans ([[Anglo-Catholics]])<ref>{{cite web |last1=Prestige |first1=Leonard |title=Anglo-Catholics: What they believe |url=http://anglicanhistory.org/sspp/prestige1927.html |via=anglicanhistory.org |publisher=[[Society of SS.

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] the term "[[Sacrament (Mormonism)|The Sacrament]]" is used of the rite.<ref name="LDS_Sacrament"/>

====Mass====
[[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is used in the [[Roman Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran churches]] (especially in the [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Church of Norway]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]]), by many Anglicans (especially those of an Anglo-Catholic churchmanship), and in some other forms of [[Western Christianity]]. At least in the Catholic Church, the Mass is a longer rite which always consists of two main parts: the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist, in that order. The Liturgy of the Word consists mainly of readings from scripture (the Bible) and a [[homily]] (otherwise called a sermon) preached by a priest or deacon and is essentially distinct and separate from the Sacrament of the Eucharist, which comprises the entirety of the Liturgy of the Eucharist, so the Eucharist itself is only about one half of the Mass. (It is also possible and permissible in the Roman Rite for distribution of the Eucharist to occur outside the ritual structure of the Mass—such an event is often called a communion service—but it is much more common to celebrate a full Mass.) Among the many other terms used in the Catholic Church are "Holy Mass", "the Memorial of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of the Lord", the "Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", and the "Holy Mysteries".<ref>{{cite book | author=Catholic Church | year=2006 |title=Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church | page=275 | publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana }}, and {{cite book | author=Catholic Church | year=1997 | title=Catechism of the Catholic Church | pages=1328–32 | isbn=978-1574551105 | url=https://archive.org/details/catechismofcatho2000cath | url-access=registration }}</ref> The term ''mass'' derives from post-classical Latin ''missa'' ("dismissal"), found in the concluding phrase of the liturgy, "''[[Ite, missa est]]''".<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/114665 "mass"].</ref> The term ''missa'' has come to imply a 'mission', because at the end of the Mass the congregation are sent out to serve Christ.<ref>{{cite web |title=Concluding Rites |url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/the-mass/order-of-mass/concluding-rites/index.cfm |website=www.usccb.org |accessdate=14 September 2018 }}</ref>

====Divine Liturgy and Divine Service====
The term [[Divine Liturgy]] ({{lang-grc-gre|Θεία Λειτουργία}}) is used in [[Byzantine Rite]] traditions, whether in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] or among the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. These also speak of "the Divine Mysteries", especially in reference to the consecrated elements, which they also call "the Holy Gifts".<ref group="note">Within [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the "Oblation" is the term used in the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]] churches, while "Consecration" is used in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]. "Oblation" and "Consecration" are of course used also by the Eastern Catholic Churches that are of the same liturgical tradition as these churches. Likewise, in the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] language of Ireland and Scotland the word {{lang|ga|Aifreann}}, usually translated into English as "Mass", is derived from [[Late Latin]] {{lang|la|Offerendum}}, meaning "oblation", "offering".</ref>

The term [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]] ({{lang-de|Gottesdienst}}) is used in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Churches]], in addition to the terms "Eucharist", "Mass" and "Holy Communion".<ref name="Spicer2016">{{cite book|last=Spicer|first=Andrew|title=Lutheran Churches in Early Modern Europe|date=5 December 2016|publisher=Routledge|language=English |isbn=978-1351921169|page=185}}</ref> The term reflects the Lutheran belief that God is serving the congregants in the liturgy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fblcchicago.org/worship/the-lutheran-way-of-worship|title=The Lutheran Way of Worship|last=Kellerman|first=James|publisher=First Bethlehem Lutheran Church|language=English|accessdate=12 June 2017}}</ref>

====Other Eastern Rites====
Some Eastern rites have yet more names for Eucharist. [[Holy Qurbana]] is common in [[Syriac Christianity]] and ''Badarak''<ref>{{Citation|last=Hovhanessian|first=Vahan|chapter=Badarak (Patarag)|date=2011|publisher=American Cancer Society|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470670606.wbecc0112|isbn=9780470670606|title=The Encyclopedia of Christian Civilization}}</ref> in the [[Armenian Rite]]; in the [[Alexandrian Rite]], the term ''Prosfora''<ref>From [[Greek language|Greek]] προσφορά</ref> is common in [[Christianity in Egypt|Coptic Christianity]] and "Keddase" in [[Ethiopian Christianity|Ethiopian]] and [[Christianity in Eritrea|Eritrean Christianity]].<ref name="Bradshaw2012">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ms20-mUmdYwC&q=Coptic+eucharist&pg=PA142|title=The Eucharistic Liturgies: Their Evolution and Interpretation|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Paul F.|last2=Johnson|first2=Maxwell E.|date=2012-06-01|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=9780814662663|language=en}}</ref>

==History==
{{Further|Origin of the Eucharist}}
[[File:Juan de Juanes 002.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Christ with the Eucharist'', [[Vicente Juan Masip]], 16th century.]]

===Biblical basis===
The [[Last Supper]] appears in all three [[Synoptic Gospels]]: [[Gospel according to Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel according to Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel according to Luke|Luke]]. It also is found in the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]],<ref name=EB/><ref>Tyndale Bible Dictionary / editors, Philip W. Comfort, Walter A. Elwell, 2001 {{ISBN|0842370897}}, article: ''Lord's Supper, The''</ref><ref>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church / editors, F. L. Cross & E. A. Livingstone 2005 {{ISBN|978-0192802903}}, article ''Eucharist''</ref> which suggests how early Christians celebrated what [[Paul the Apostle]] called the Lord's Supper. Although the [[Gospel of John]] does not reference the Last Supper explicitly, some argue that it contains theological allusions to the early Christian celebration of the Eucharist, especially in the chapter 6 [[Bread of Life Discourse]] but also in other passages.<ref>{{Cite book|title = "A Hard Saying" : The Gospel and Culture|last = Moloney|first = Francis|publisher = The Liturgical Press|year = 2001|pages = 109–30}}</ref>

====Paul the Apostle and the Lord's Supper====
In his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] (c. 54–55), [[Paul the Apostle]] gives the earliest recorded description of Jesus' [[Last Supper]]: "The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.'{{Bibleref2c|1cor|11:23–25||1 Cor. 11:23–25}}   Those interested might note that the Greek word for remembrance is ἀνάμνησιν or "[[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]]", which itself has a much richer theological history than the English word for "remember".

====Gospels====
The synoptic gospels, {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:22–25}}, {{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:26–29|NIV}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:13–20|NIV}}, depict Jesus as presiding over the Last Supper prior to his crucifixion. The versions in Matthew and Mark are almost identical,<ref>Heron, Alisdair >I.C. ''Table and Tradition'' Westminster Press, Philadelphia (1983) p. 3</ref> but Luke's Gospel presents a textual problem in that a few manuscripts omit the second half of verse 19 and all of v.20 ("given for you … poured out for you"), which are found in the vast majority of ancient witnesses to the text.<ref>Metzger, Bruce M. ''A Textual Commentary on the New Testament'' UBS (1971) pp. 173ff</ref> If the shorter text is the original one, then Luke's account is independent of both that of Paul and that of Matthew/Mark. If the majority longer text comes from the author of the third gospel, then this version is very similar to that of Paul in 1 Corinthians, being somewhat fuller in its description of the early part of the Supper,<ref>Heron, Alisdair >I.C. ''Table and Tradition'' Westminster Press, Philadelphia (1983) p. 5</ref> particularly in making specific mention of a cup being blessed before the bread was broken.<ref>Caird, G.B. ''The Gospel of Luke'' Pelican (1963) p. 237</ref>

Uniquely, in the one prayer given to posterity by Jesus, the [[Lord's Prayer]], the word [[epiousios]]—which does not exist in Classical Greek literature—has been interpreted by some as meaning "super-substantial", a reference to the [[Bread of Life]], the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite web |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s2a3.htm |website=www.vatican.va |accessdate=14 September 2018 }}</ref>

In the gospel of John, however, the account of the Last Supper does not mention Jesus taking bread and "the cup" and speaking of them as his body and blood; instead, it recounts other events: his humble act of washing the disciples' feet, the prophecy of the betrayal, which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross, and his long discourse in response to some questions posed by his followers, in which he went on to speak of the importance of the unity of the disciples with him, with each other, and with the Father.<ref name="Harris">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible.

[[Paschasius Radbertus]] (785–865) was a Carolingian theologian, and the abbot of [[Corbie Abbey|Corbie]], whose most well-known and influential work is an exposition on the nature of the Eucharist written around 831, entitled ''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini''.
He was canonized in 1073 by [[Pope Gregory VII]]. His works are edited in ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' vol. 120 (1852).

==Eucharistic theology==
{{Main|Eucharistic theology}}
Most Christians, even those who deny that there is any real change in the elements used, recognize a special presence of [[Christ]] in this rite. But Christians differ about exactly how, where and how long Christ is present in it.<ref name="EB"/> [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Church of the East]] teach that the reality (the "substance") of the elements of bread and wine is wholly changed into the body and blood of Jesus Christ, while the appearances (the "species") remain. [[Transubstantiation]] ("''change of the substance''") is the term used by Catholics to denote ''what'' is changed, not to explain ''how'' the change occurs, since the Catholic Church teaches that "the signs of bread and wine become, ''in a way surpassing understanding'', the Body and Blood of Christ".<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3Z.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1333] (emphasis added)</ref> The Orthodox use various terms such as transelementation, but no explanation is official as they prefer to leave it a mystery.

[[Lutheran]]s and Reformed Christians believe Christ to be present and may both use the term "[[sacramental union]]" to describe this. However, Lutherans believe that the whole Christ, including his body and blood, are truly present in the supper, whereas the Reformed generally describe a "spiritual presence," as Jesus' body (and thereby his blood) are present in heaven and cannot be present on Earth as well.<ref>{{cite book |last=Horton |first=Michael S. |author-link=Michael Horton (theologian) |title=People and Place: A Covenant Ecclesiology |year=2008 |location=Louisville, KY |publisher=[[Westminster John Knox Press]] |isbn=978-0664230715 |page=126}}</ref> Lutherans specify that Christ is "in, with and under" the forms of bread and wine.<ref name="EB"/> [[Anglicans]] adhere to [[Anglican eucharistic theology|a range of views]] although the teaching in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] holds that the body of Christ is received by the faithful only in a heavenly and spiritual manner. Some Christians do not believe in the concept of the real presence, believing that the Eucharist is only a ceremonial remembrance or [[memorialism|memorial]] of the death of Christ.

The ''Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry'' document of the [[World Council of Churches]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text?set_language=en |title=Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry (Faith and Order Paper no. 111, the "Lima Text") |publisher=Oikoumene.org |date=1982-01-15 |accessdate=2019-05-16}}</ref> attempting to present the common understanding of the Eucharist on the part of the generality of Christians, describes it as "essentially the sacrament of the gift which God makes to us in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit", "Thanksgiving to the Father", "Anamnesis or Memorial of Christ", "the sacrament of the unique sacrifice of Christ, who ever lives to make intercession for us", "the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, the sacrament of his [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|real presence]]", "Invocation of the Spirit", "Communion of the Faithful", and "Meal of the Kingdom".

==Ritual and liturgy==
Many Christian denominations classify the Eucharist as a [[sacrament]].<ref>For example, Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, "Anglo-Catholic" Anglicans, Old Catholics; and cf. the presentation of the Eucharist as a sacrament in the [http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry. html#c10499 ''Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry'' document]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} of the [[World Council of Churches]]</ref> Some [[Protestants]] (though not all) prefer to instead call it an ''[[Ordinance (Christianity)|ordinance]]'', viewing it not as a specific channel of [[divine grace]] but as an expression of faith and of obedience to Christ.

====As a sacrifice====
In the Eucharist the same sacrifice that Jesus made only once on the cross is made present at every Mass. According to [[Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church]] "The Eucharist is the very sacrifice of the Body and Blood of the Lord Jesus which he instituted to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until his return in glory. Thus he entrusted to his Church this memorial of his death and Resurrection. It is a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal banquet, in which Christ is consumed, the mind is filled with grace, and a pledge of future glory is given to us."<ref>{{cite web |title=Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church #271|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20sacraments%20of%20Christian%20initiation |website=www.vatican.va |accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref>

For the Catholic Church the Eucharist is the memorial of Christ's Passover, the making present and the sacramental offering of his unique sacrifice, in the liturgy of the Church which is his Body.<ref>{{cite book |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of the Eucharist #1362 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a3.htm |accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref>.. the ''memorial'' is not merely the recollection of past events but ... they become in a certain way present and real.<ref>{{cite book |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of the Eucharist #1363 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a3.htm |accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref> When the Church celebrates the Eucharist, she commemorates Christ's Passover, and it is made present the sacrifice Christ offered once for all on the cross remains ever present.<ref>{{cite book |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of the Eucharist #1364 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a3.htm |accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref> The Eucharist is thus a sacrifice because it re-presents (makes present) the same and only sacrifice offered once for all on the cross, because it is its memorial and because it applies its fruit.<ref>{{cite book |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of the Eucharist #1366 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a3.htm |accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref>

The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are one single sacrifice: "The victim is one and the same: the same now offers through the ministry of priests, who then offered himself on the cross; only the manner of offering is different." "And since in this divine sacrifice which is celebrated in the Mass, the same Christ who offered himself once in a bloody manner on the altar of the cross is contained and is offered in an unbloody manner... this sacrifice is truly propitiatory."<ref>[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt1art3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1367]; [http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct22.html Council of Trent: Session XXII, chapter 2]</ref>

Currently, however, scripture scholars contend that using the word "propitiation" was a mistranslation by [[Jerome]] from the Greek ''hilastērion'' into the Latin Vulgate,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Raymond E.|title=New Jerome Biblical Commentary, 82: 73|publisher=Pearson|year=1989|isbn=0136149340|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and is misleading for describing the sacrifice of Jesus and its Eucharistic remembrance. One expression of the conclusion of theologians is that sacrifice "is not something human beings do to God (that would be [[propitiation#Contemporary Catholic theology|propitiation]]) but something which God does for human kind (which is expiation)."<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Daly|first=Robert|date=March 2003|title=Sacrifice Unveiled or Sacrifice Revisited|journal=Theological Studies|doi=10.1177/004056390306400130|s2cid=170816180}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mulcahy|first=E|title=Cause of Our Salvation|publisher=Gregorian & Biblical Press|year=2007|isbn=978-8878390805}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Fides|first=P.

The only ministers who can officiate at the Eucharist and consecrate the sacrament are ordained priests (either bishops or [[presbyter]]s) acting in the person of Christ (''"in persona Christi"'').  In other words, the priest celebrant represents Christ, who is the Head of the Church, and acts before God the Father in the name of the Church, always using "we" not "I" during the Eucharistic prayer . The matter used must be wheaten bread and grape wine; this is considered essential for validity.<ref>[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt1art3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1412]; [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P39.HTM ''Code of Canon Law'', canon 924]; [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0758/_P1S.HTM ''Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches'', canon 705]</ref>

The [[Catholic Church]] teaches that Jesus is present in a true, real and substantial way, with his Body and his Blood, with his Soul and his Divinity under the Eucharistic species of bread and wine, Christ whole and entire, God and Man. During the consecration of bread and wine, both bread and wine become the body and blood of Jesus Christ. The change of the whole substance of bread into the substance of the Body of Christ and of the whole substance of wine into the substance of his Blood is called transubstantiation. This change is brought about in the eucharistic prayer through the efficacy of the word of Christ and by the action of the Holy Spirit. However, the outward characteristics of bread and wine, that is the "eucharistic species", remain unaltered.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Sacrament of the Eucharist: Basic Questions and Answers|url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/the-mass/order-of-mass/liturgy-of-the-eucharist/the-real-presence-of-jesus-christ-in-the-sacrament-of-the-eucharist-basic-questions-and-answers.cfm|website=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Aquinas|first1=Thomas|title=Summa Theologiæ Article 2|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4075.htm|website=New Advent|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct13.html |title=Council of Trent, Decree concerning the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, chapter IV and canon II |publisher=History.hanover.edu |accessdate=2019-05-16}}</ref> The presence of Christ continues in the Eucharist as long as the eucharistic species subsist.<ref>Council of Trent, Decree concerning the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, canon III</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a3.htm|website=The Holy See|publisher=The Catholic Church|accessdate=4 January 2017|ref=1377}}</ref> that is, until the Eucharist is digested, physically destroyed, or decays by some natural process<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mulcahy, O.P.|first1=Bernard|title=The Holy Eucharist|url=http://www.kofc.org/un/es/resources/cis/cis320.pdf|website=kofc.org|publisher=Knights of Columbus|accessdate=4 January 2017|ref=p. 32}}</ref> (at which point Aquinas argued that the substance of the bread and wine cannot return).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aquinas|first1=Thomas|title=Summa Theologiae, Question 77|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4077.htm#article4|website=New Advent|publisher=Kevin Knight|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref> The empirical appearance and physical properties (called the ''species'' or ''[[Species (Christianity)|accidents]]'') are not changed, but in the view of Catholics, the reality (called the ''[[Primary substance|substance]]'') indeed is; hence the term ''transubstantiation'' to describe the phenomenon. The Council of Trent declares that by the consecration of the bread (known as the [[Host (Holy Communion)|Host]]) and wine "there takes place a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood. This change the holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called transubstantiation."<ref>{{cite book |title=Under Julius III&nbsp; Council of Trent Session 13 CHAPTER IV |url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/TRENT13.HTM |accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref> The Church holds that the body and blood of Jesus can no longer be truly separated. Where one is, the other must be. Therefore, although the priest (or [[extraordinary minister of Holy Communion]]) says "The Body of Christ" when administering the Host and "The Blood of Christ" when presenting the chalice, the communicant who receives either one receives Christ, whole and entire. "The Eucharistic presence of Christ begins at the moment of the consecration and endures as long as the Eucharistic species subsist. Christ is present whole and entire in each of the species and whole and entire in each of their parts, in such a way that the breaking of the bread does not divide Christ."<ref>{{cite web |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of the Eucharist #1377 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a3.htm |website=www.vatican.va |accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref>

[[File:BentoXVI-51-11052007 (frag).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] celebrates a Mass.]]
The Catholic Church sees as the main basis for this belief the words of Jesus himself at his Last Supper: the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:26–28|NAB}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:22–24|NAB}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:19–20|NAB}}) and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul's]] {{bibleref2|1cor|11:23–25||1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;11:23–25}} recount that in that context Jesus said of what to all appearances were bread and wine: "This is my body … this is my blood." The Catholic understanding of these words, from the [[Patristics|Patristic]] authors onward, has emphasized their roots in the covenantal history of the Old Testament. The interpretation of Christ's words against this Old Testament background coheres with and supports belief in the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stephenpimentel.tripod.com/papers/eucharist2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210092453/http://stephenpimentel.tripod.com/papers/eucharist2.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-12-10 |title="Abrahamic, Mosaic, and Prophetic Foundations of the Eucharist".

In 1551, the [[Council of Trent]] definitively declared, "Because Christ our Redeemer said that it was truly his body that he was offering under the species of bread,{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|6:51}} it has always been the conviction of the Church of God, and this holy Council now declares again that by the consecration of the bread and wine there takes place a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood. This change the holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called [[transubstantiation]]."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151021191355/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P41.html ''CCC 1376'']</ref><ref>[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct13.html Session XIII, chapter IV]; cf. canon II)</ref> The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] in 1215 had spoken of "Jesus Christ, whose body and blood are truly contained in the sacrament of the altar under the forms of bread and wine, the bread being changed (''transsubstantiatis'') by divine power into the body and the wine into the blood."{{NoteTag|[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.html Canon 1.] A misprint in this source gives "transubstantiatio" in place of "transubstantiatis" of the original: "Iesus Christus, cuius corpus et sanguis in sacramento altaris sub speciebus panis et vini veraciter continentur, transsubstantiatis pane in corpus, et vino in sanguinem potestate divina"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catho.org/9.php?d=bxw#bo5 |title=Denzinger 8020 |publisher=Catho.org |accessdate=2019-05-16}}</ref>}} The attempt by some twentieth-century Catholic theologians to present the Eucharistic change as an alteration of significance ([[transignification]] rather than transubstantiation) was rejected by [[Pope Paul VI]] in his 1965 encyclical letter ''[[Mysterium fidei (encyclical)|Mysterium fidei]]''. In his 1968 ''[[Credo of the People of God]]'', he reiterated that any theological explanation of the doctrine must hold to the twofold claim that, after the consecration, 1) Christ's body and blood are really present; and 2) bread and wine are really absent; and this presence and absence is ''real'' and not merely something in the mind of the believer. In line with these basics, and in a spirit of [[ecumenism]], the term "real presence" might be favored, with the same essential meaning but avoiding the scholastic/philosophical overtones of the term "transubstantiation".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Transubstantiation Archives|url=https://www.hprweb.com/tag/transubstantiation/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Homiletic & Pastoral Review|language=en-US}}</ref>

On entering a church, [[Roman Rite]] Catholics [[genuflect]] to the [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] that holds the consecrated host in order to respectfully acknowledge the presence of Jesus in the [[Blessed Sacrament]], a presence signalled by a [[sanctuary lamp]] or [[votive candle]] kept burning close to such a tabernacle. (If there is no such burning light, it indicates that the tabernacle is empty of the special presence of Jesus in the Eucharist.) Catholics will also often kneel or sit before the tabernacle, when the sanctuary light is lit, to pray directly to Jesus, materially present in the form of the Eucharist. Similarly, the consecrated Eucharistic host is sometimes exposed on the altar, usually in an ornamental fixture called a [[Monstrance]], so that Catholics may pray or contemplate in the direct presence and in direct view of Jesus in the Eucharist; this is sometimes called "exposition of the Blessed Sacrament", and the prayer and contemplation in front of the exposed Eucharist are often called "adoration of the Blessed Sacrament" or just "adoration".  All of these practices stem from belief in the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist, which is an essential Article of Faith of the Catholic Church.

According to the Catholic Church doctrine receiving the Eucharist in a state of [[mortal sin]] is a [[sacrilege]]<ref>[https://www.catholicity.com/baltimore-catechism/lesson28.html Lesson 28 from the Baltimore Cathechism #368]</ref> and only those who are in a state of grace, that is, without any mortal sin, can receive it.<ref>{{cite book |title=Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church # 291 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> Based on {{bibleref2|1cor|11:27-29||1 Corinthians 11:27-29}} it affirms the following: "Anyone who is aware of having committed a mortal sin must not receive Holy Communion, even if he experiences deep contrition, without having first received [[Penance (Catholic Church)|sacramental absolution]], unless he has a grave reason for receiving Communion and there is no possibility of going to confession."<ref>{{cite book |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church #1385 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a3.htm |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church #1457 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c2a4.htm |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref>

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
[[File:Liturgy St James 1.jpg|thumb|Eucharistic elements prepared for the Divine Liturgy]]
{{Main|Divine Liturgy}}
Within [[Eastern Christianity]], the Eucharistic service is called the ''Divine Liturgy'' ([[Byzantine Rite]]) or similar names in other rites. It comprises two main divisions: the first is the ''Liturgy of the Catechumens'' which consists of introductory litanies, antiphons and scripture readings, culminating in a reading from one of the [[Gospels]] and, often, a [[homily]]; the second is the ''Liturgy of the Faithful'' in which the Eucharist is offered, consecrated, and received as Holy Communion. Within the latter, the actual Eucharistic prayer is called the ''[[anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]], '' literally: "offering" or "carrying up" ({{lang|grc|ἀνα- + φέρω}}). In the [[Rite of Constantinople]], two different anaphoras are currently used: one is attributed to Saint [[John Chrysostom]], the other to [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil the Great]]. In the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]], a variety of anaphoras are used, but all are similar in structure to those of the Constantinopolitan Rite, in which the Anaphora of Saint John Chrysostom is used most days of the year; Saint Basil's is offered on the Sundays of [[Great Lent]], the eves of [[Christmas]] and [[Theophany]], [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], [[Holy Saturday]], and upon his feast day (1 January). At the conclusion of the Anaphora the bread and wine are held to be the Body and Blood of Christ. Unlike the Latin Church, the [[Byzantine Rite]] uses leavened bread, with the leaven symbolizing the presence of the Holy Spirit.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSXu17g7BRwC&pg=PA90 |first=Steven |last=Runciman |title=The Great Church in Captivity |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1968 |isbn=978-0521313100 |page=90}}</ref> The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], like the Latin Church, uses unleavened bread, whereas the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] utilizes leavened bread in their celebration.<ref>[https://www.orthodoxanswers.org/why-do-the-orthodox-use-leavened-bread-since-leaven-is-a-symbol-of-sin-is-not-christs-body-sinless/ Why do the Orthodox use leavened bread since leaven is a symbol of sin?

Conventionally this change in the elements is understood to be accomplished at the ''[[Epiclesis]]'' ("invocation") by which the [[Holy Spirit]] is invoked and the [[consecration]] of the bread and wine as the true and genuine Body and Blood of Christ is specifically requested, but since the anaphora as a whole is considered a unitary (albeit lengthy) prayer, no one moment within it can readily be singled out.

===Protestantism===
====Anglican====
{{Main|Anglican eucharistic theology}}
Anglican eucharistic theology is not [[Memorialism|memorialist]] (the belief that nothing special happens at the Lord's Supper other than devotional reflection on Christ's death). Christ's is present in the fullness of his person but Church of England repeatedly has refused to make official any definition of the Presence preferring to leave it a mystery while proclaiming the consecrated bread and wine to be the spiritual food of his Most Precious Body and Blood or just his Body and Blood. The bread and wine are an "outward sign of an inner grace," BCP Catechism, p. 859. The Words of Administration at Communion allow for Real Presence or for a real but spiritual Presence (Calvinist Receptionism and Virtualism) which was congenial to most Anglicans well into the 19th Century.<ref>The Study of Liturgy, Revised Edition, SPCK London, 1992, p. 316.</ref> From the 1840s the Tractarians re-introduced the Real Presence to suggest a corporeal presence which could be done since the language of the BCP Rite referred to the Body and Blood of Christ without details as well as referring to these as spiritual food at other places in the text. Both are found in the Roman and other Rites, but in the former a definite interpretation is applied. Receptionism and Virtualism assert the Real Presence. The former places emphasis on the recipient, and the latter states the Presence is confected by the power of the Holy Spirit but not in Christ's natural body. His presence is objective and does not depend on its existence from the faith of the recipient. The liturgy petitions that elements 'be' rather than 'become' the Body and Blood of Christ leaving aside any theory of a change in the natural elements: bread and wine are the outer reality and the Presence is the inner not visible but perceived by faith.<ref>The Study of Liturgy, pp. 314-324</ref> 

In 1789 the Protestant Episcopal Church of the USA restored explicit language that the Eucharist is an oblation (sacrifice) to God. Subsequent revisions of the Prayer Book by member churches of the Anglican Communion have done likewise (the Church of England did so in the 1928 Prayer Book).<ref>The Study of Liturgy, p. 318-324</ref>    

The so-called 'Black Rubric' in the 1552 Prayer Book which allowed kneeling for communion but denied the real and essential presence of Christ in the elements was omitted in the 1559 edition at the Queen's insistence. It was re-instated in the 1662 Book modified to deny any corporeal presence to suggest Christ was present in his Natural Body. 

In most parishes of the [[Anglican Communion]] the Eucharist is celebrated every Sunday, having replaced Morning Prayer as the principal service. The rites for the Eucharist are found in the various prayer books of the Anglican churches. Wine and unleavened wafers or unleavened bread is used. Daily celebrations are the norm in many [[cathedral]]s and parish churches sometimes offer one or more services of Holy Communion during the week. The nature of the liturgy varies according to the theological tradition of the priests, parishes, [[diocese]]s and regional churches. Leavened or unleavened bread may be used.

====Baptist groups====
[[File:Communion Baptist.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.15|The serving of elements individually, to be taken in unison, is common among Baptists.]]
The bread and "fruit of the vine" indicated in Matthew, Mark and Luke as the elements of the ''Lord's Supper''<ref>{{bibleref|Matthew|26:26–29}}, {{bibleref|Mark|14:22–25}}, {{bibleref|Luke|22:19}}</ref> are interpreted by many [[Baptists]] as unleavened bread (although leavened bread is often used) and, in line with the historical stance of some Baptist groups (since the mid-19th century) against partaking of alcoholic beverages, [[grape juice]], which they commonly refer to simply as "the Cup".<ref>See, e.g., {{cite book | first=J. R. | last=Graves | year=1928 | title=What is It to Eat and Drink Unworthily | publisher=Baptist Sunday School Committee | oclc=6323560}}</ref> The unleavened bread also underscores the symbolic belief attributed to Christ's breaking the bread and saying that it was his body. A [[saltine cracker|soda cracker]] is often used.

Most Baptists consider the Communion to be primarily an act of remembrance of Christ's atonement, and a time of renewal of personal commitment.

However, with the rise of [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]], some Baptists have denied the [[Theology of Huldrych Zwingli|Zwinglian]] doctrine of mere [[memorialism]] and have taken up a Reformed view of Communion.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Confessional Baptists believe in [[Eucharistic theology#Pneumatic presence|pneumatic presence]], which is expressed in the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|Second London Baptist Confession]], specifically in Chapter 30, Articles 3 and 7. This view is prevalent among [[Southern Baptists]], those in the Founders movement (a Calvinistic movement within the some [[Independent Baptists]]), [[Freewill Baptists]], and several individuals in other Baptist associations.

Communion practices and frequency vary among congregations. A typical practice is to have small cups of juice and plates of broken bread distributed to the seated congregation. In other congregations, communicants may proceed to the altar to receive the elements, then return to their seats. A widely accepted practice is for all to receive and hold the elements until everyone is served, then consume the bread and cup in unison. Usually, music is performed and Scripture is read during the receiving of the elements.

Some Baptist churches are closed-Communionists (even requiring full membership in the church before partaking), with others being partially or fully open-Communionists. It is rare to find a Baptist church where The Lord's Supper is observed every Sunday; most observe monthly or quarterly, with some holding Communion only during a designated Communion service or following a worship service.  Adults and children in attendance, who have not made a profession of faith in Christ, are expected to not participate.

====Lutheran====
{{Main|Eucharist in Lutheranism}}
{{see also|Divine Service (Lutheran)}}
[[File:EucharistELCA.JPG|right|thumb|Table set for the Eucharist in an ELCA service]]
[[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] believe that the body and blood of Christ are "truly and substantially present in, with, and under the forms" of the consecrated bread and wine (the elements), so that communicants eat and drink the body and blood of Christ himself as well as the bread and wine in this [[Lutheran sacraments|sacrament]].<ref>[[Augsburg Confession]], Article 10</ref> The Lutheran doctrine of the Real Presence is more accurately and formally known as the "[[sacramental union]]". It has been called "[[consubstantiation]]" by non-Lutherans.<ref>F. L. Cross, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', second edition, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1974), 340 ''sub loco''.</ref> This term is specifically rejected by Lutheran churches and theologians since it creates confusion about the actual doctrine and subjects the doctrine to the control of a non-biblical philosophical concept in the same manner as, in their view, does the term "[[transubstantiation]]".<ref>J. T. Mueller, ''Christian Dogmatics: A Handbook of Doctrinal Theology'', (St. Louis: CPH, 1934), 519; cf. also Erwin L. Lueker, ''Christian Cyclopedia'', (St. Louis: CPH, 1975), under the entry "consubstantiation".</ref>

While an official movement exists in Lutheran congregations to celebrate Eucharist weekly, using formal rites very similar to the Catholic and "high" Anglican services, it was historically common for congregations to celebrate monthly or even quarterly.<ref>[http://www.livingwordmedina.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7&Itemid=8 What Lutherans Believe About Holy Communion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320044022/http://www.livingwordmedina.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7&Itemid=8 |date=20 March 2011 }}.

====Mennonites and Anabaptists====
Traditional [[Mennonite]] and German Baptist Brethren Churches such as the [[Church of the Brethren]] churches and congregations have the Agape Meal, footwashing and the serving of the bread and wine two parts to the Communion service in the [[Lovefeast]]. In the more modern groups, Communion is only the serving of the Lord's Supper. In the communion meal, the members of the Mennonite churches renew their covenant with God and with each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/O745ME.html |title=Ordinances |publisher=GAMEO |date=24 August 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>

====Open Brethren and Exclusive Brethren====
Among [[Open Brethren|Open]] assemblies, also termed [[Plymouth Brethren]], the Eucharist is more commonly called the Breaking of Bread or the Lord's Supper. It is seen as a symbolic memorial and is central to the worship of both individual and assembly.<ref name="Darby">Darby, J.N., quoted in Bradshaw, P.F. ''The new SCM dictionary of liturgy and worship'', p. 375</ref> In principle, the service is open to all [[baptism|baptized]] Christians, but an individual's eligibility to participate depends on the views of each particular assembly. The service takes the form of non-liturgical, open worship with all male participants allowed to pray audibly and select hymns or readings. The breaking of bread itself typically consists of one leavened loaf, which is prayed over and broken by a participant in the meeting<ref>Muller, G. (1860) ''A Narrative of some of the Lord's dealings with George Muller'', pp. 279–81</ref> and then shared around. The wine is poured from a single container into one or several vessels, and these are again shared around.<ref>Bradshaw, P.F. ''The new SCM dictionary of liturgy and worship'', p. 375</ref><ref>[http://www.brethrenonline.org/faqs/Brethren.htm Brethren Online FAQs] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518150855/http://brethrenonline.org/faqs/Brethren.htm |date=18 May 2016 }}</ref>

The [[Exclusive Brethren]] follow a similar practice to the [[Open Brethren]]. They also call the Eucharist the Breaking of Bread or the Lord's Supper.<ref name="Darby" />

====Reformed (Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist)====
{{Main|Lord's Supper in Reformed theology}}
In the [[Reformed]] tradition (which includes the [[Continental Reformed Church]]es, the [[Presbyterian Church]]es, and the [[Congregationalist Church]]es), the Eucharist is variously administered. The Calvinist view of the Sacrament sees a real presence of Christ in the supper which differs both from the objective ontological presence of the Catholic view, and from the real absence of Christ and the mental recollection of the memorialism of the Zwinglians<ref>McGrath, Alister E. ''Reformation Thought'' Oxford: Blackwell (2003) p. 189</ref> and their successors.

[[File:South Leith communion token reverse.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Many Presbyterian churches historically used [[communion token]]s to provide entrance to the Lord's Supper.]]
The bread and wine become the means by which the believer has real communion with Christ in his death and Christ's body and blood are present to the faith of the believer as really as the bread and wine are present to their senses but this presence is "spiritual", that is the work of the Holy Spirit.<ref>Hendry, George S. ''The Westminster Confession for Today'' SCM (1960) p. 232</ref> There is no standard frequency; John Calvin desired weekly communion, but the city council only approved monthly, and monthly celebration has become the most common practice in Reformed churches today.

Many, on the other hand, follow [[John Knox]] in celebration of the Lord's supper on a quarterly basis, to give proper time for reflection and inward consideration of one's own state and sin. Recently, Presbyterian and Reformed Churches have been considering whether to restore more frequent communion, including weekly communion in more churches, considering that infrequent communion was derived from a memorialist view of the Lord's Supper, rather than Calvin's view of the sacrament as a means of grace.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.opc.org/OS/html/V6/4l.html|title=The Lord's Supper: How Often?|author=D. G. Hart and John R. Muether|journal=Ordained Servant|volume=6|issue=4|date=October 1997}}</ref> Some churches use bread without any raising agent (whether [[leaven]] or [[yeast]]), in view of the use of [[matzo|unleavened bread]] at [[Passover seder|Jewish Passover meals]], while others use any bread available.

The [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], for instance, prescribes "bread common to the culture". Harking back to the [[regulative principle of worship]], the Reformed tradition had long eschewed coming forward to receive communion, preferring to have the elements distributed throughout the congregation by the presbyters (elders) more in the style of a shared meal. Over the last half a century it is much more common in Presbyterian churches to have Holy Communion monthly or on a weekly basis. It is also becoming common to receive the elements by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it) Wine and grape juice are both used, depending on the congregation.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Most Reformed churches practice open communion", i.e., all believers who are united to a church of like faith and practice, and who are not living in sin, would be allowed to join in the Sacrament.

====Methodist====
[[File:Methodistcommunion6.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|A United Methodist minister consecrating the elements]]
The British ''Catechism for the use of the people called Methodists'' states that, "[in the Eucharist] Jesus Christ is [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|present]] with his worshipping people and gives himself to them as their Lord and Saviour".<ref name="Methcat" /> Methodist theology of this sacrament is reflected in one of the fathers of the movement, [[Charles Wesley]], who wrote a Eucharistic hymn with the following stanza:<ref name="AbrahamWatson2013"/>
:We need not now go up to Heaven,
:To bring the long sought Saviour down;
:Thou art to all already given,
:Thou dost e’en now Thy banquet crown:
:To every faithful soul appear,
:And show Thy real presence here!<ref name="AbrahamWatson2013">{{cite book|last1=Abraham|first1=William J.|last2=Watson|first2=David F.|title=Key United Methodist Beliefs|year=2013|publisher=Abingdon Press|language=English |isbn=978-1426756610|pages=103–04|quote=Charles Wesley wrote a marvelous collection of hymns that offer an amazing vision of Christ's mysterious, yet real, presence in the bread and the wine.

Reflecting [[Wesleyan covenant theology]], Methodists also believe that the Lord's Supper is a sign and seal of the [[covenant of grace]].<ref name="Crowther1815">{{cite book|last=Crowther|first=Jonathan |title=A Portraiture of Methodism|year=1815|language=English|page=224|quote=The Methodists believe, that the covenant of grace has been administered and renewed in different ages of the world. ...

In many [[List of Methodist denominations|Methodist denominations]], non-alcoholic wine (grape juice) is used, so as to include those who do not take alcohol for any reason, as well as a commitment to the Church's historical support of [[Temperance movement|temperance]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Alcohol|url=http://www.methodist.org.uk/who-we-are/views-of-the-church/alcohol|publisher=[[Methodist Church of Great Britain]]|accessdate=10 November 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/why-do-most-methodist-churches-serve-grape-juice-instead-of-wine |title=... the use of unfermented grape juice by The United Methodist Church ... expresses pastoral concern for recovering alcoholics, enables the participation of children and youth, and supports the church's witness of abstinence.}}</ref> Variations of the [[Eucharistic Prayer]] are provided for various occasions, including communion of the sick and brief forms for occasions that call for greater brevity. Though the ritual is standardized, there is great variation amongst Methodist churches, from typically high-church to low-church, in the enactment and style of celebration. Methodist clergy are not required to be vested when celebrating the Eucharist.

[[John Wesley]], a founder of Methodism, said that it was the duty of Christians to receive the sacrament as often as possible. Methodists in the United States are encouraged to celebrate the Eucharist every Sunday, though it is typically celebrated on the first Sunday of each month, while a few go as long as celebrating quarterly (a tradition dating back to the days of [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit riders]] that served multiple churches). Communicants may receive standing, kneeling, or while seated. Gaining more wide acceptance is the practice of receiving by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it). The most common alternative to intinction is for the communicants to receive the consecrated juice using small, individual, specially made glass or plastic cups known as [[communion cup]]s.<ref>[http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product Communion Cups, 1000] from Broadman / Holman Church Supply. Christianbook.com. Accessed 5 July 2009.</ref> The [[United Methodist Church]] practices open communion, inviting "all who intend a Christian life, together with their children" to receive Communion.<ref>UMC 1992, 29.</ref>

====Nondenominational and other Christians====
[[File:Lord's cup and Bread.JPG|thumb|right|Communion elements: [[matzo]] is sometimes used for bread, emphasising the "re-creation" of the Last Supper.]]
Many non-denominational Christians, including the [[Churches of Christ]], receive communion every Sunday. Others, including [[Evangelical]] churches such as the [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)|Church of God]], [[Calvary Chapel]], and many forms of [[Baptist]], typically receive communion on a monthly or periodic basis. Many non-denominational Christians hold to the Biblical [[autonomy]] of local churches and have no universal requirement among congregations.

Some [[Churches of Christ]], among others, use [[grape juice]] and unleavened wafers or unleavened bread and practice open communion.

===Other Christian churches===

====Syriac====
{{Main|Holy Qurbana}}
'''Holy Qurbana''' or '''Qurbana Qadisha, ''' the "Holy Offering" or "Holy Sacrifice", refers to the Eucharist as celebrated according to the [[East Syrian Rite|East Syrian]] and [[West Syrian Rite|West Syrian traditions]] of [[Syriac Christianity]]. The main [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphora]] of the East Syrian tradition is the [[Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari]], while that of the West Syrian tradition is the [[Liturgy of Saint James]]. Both are extremely old, going back at least to the third century, and are the oldest extant liturgies continually in use.

====Seventh-day Adventists====
In the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] the Holy Communion service customarily is celebrated once per quarter. The service includes the ordinance of [[footwashing]] and the Lord's Supper. Unleavened bread and unfermented (non-alcoholic) grape juice is used. [[Open communion]] is practised: all who have committed their lives to the Saviour may participate. The communion service must be conducted by an ordained pastor, minister or church elder.<ref>Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual, 17th edition, 2005, pp. 81–86.

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
The [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses]] commemorates Christ's death as a [[ransom sacrifice|ransom]] or [[propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] by observing a Memorial annually on the evening that corresponds to the Passover,<ref>''Reasoning From The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 265.</ref> [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], according to the ancient [[Jewish calendar]].<ref>''Insight on the Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, p. 392.</ref> They refer to this observance generally as "the Lord's Evening Meal" or the "Memorial of Christ's Death", taken from Jesus' words to his Apostles "do this as a memorial of me". (Luke 22:19)<ref>[https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/luke/22.htm Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers - Luke 22] "This do in remembrance of me.—Literally, ''as My memorial'', or, ''as your memorial of Me.''" - Retrieved 18 October 2019.</ref> They believe that this is the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians in the Bible.<ref>"Jehovah is a God of Covenants", ''The Watchtower'', 1 February 1998, p. 8, "Jesus instituted the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians—the Memorial of his death."</ref>

Of those who attend the Memorial a small minority worldwide partake of the wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that [[144,000#Jehovah's Witnesses|only 144,000]] people will receive heavenly salvation and immortal life and thus spend eternity with God and Christ in heaven, with glorified bodies, as under-priests and co-rulers under [[Christ the King]] and [[High priest#Christianity|High Priest]], in [[God's Kingdom|Jehovah's Kingdom]]. Paralleling the [[anointing]] of kings and priests, they are referred to as the "anointed" class and are the only ones who should partake of the bread and wine.  They believe that the baptized "[[other sheep]]" of Christ's flock, or the "[[Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation#The 'other sheep' and the 'great crowd'|great crowd]]", also benefit from the [[ransom sacrifice]], and are respectful observers and viewers of the Lord's Supper remembrance at these special meetings of Jehovah's witnesses, with hope of receiving salvation, through Christ's atoning sacrifice, which is memorialized by the Lord's Evening Meal, and with the hope of obtaining everlasting life in Paradise restored on a prophesied "[[New Earth (Christianity)|New Earth]]", under Christ as Redeemer and Ruler.<ref name=jwbh>{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005155|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=207}}</ref>

The Memorial, held after sundown, includes a sermon on the meaning and importance of the celebration and gathering, and includes the circulation and viewing among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread (matzo). Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the bread symbolizes and represents Jesus Christ's perfect body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine represents his perfect blood which he shed at Calvary and redeems fallen man from inherited sin and death. The wine and the bread (sometimes referred to as "emblems") are viewed as symbolic and commemorative; the Witnesses do not believe in [[transubstantiation]] or [[consubstantiation]]; so not a literal presence of flesh and blood in the emblems, but that the emblems are simply sacred symbolisms and representations, denoting what was used in the first Lord's Supper, and which figuratively represent the ransom sacrifice of Jesus and sacred realities.<ref name=jwbh /><ref>"Discerning What We Are – At Memorial Time", ''The Watchtower'', 15 February 1990, p. 16.</ref>

==Non-observing denominations==
While the [[Salvation Army]] does not reject the Eucharistic practices of other churches or deny that their members truly receive grace through this sacrament, it does not practice the sacraments of Communion or [[baptism]].  This is because they believe that these are unnecessary for the living of a Christian life, and because in the opinion of Salvation Army founders William and Catherine Booth, the sacrament placed too much stress on outward ritual and too little on inward spiritual conversion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waterbeachsalvationarmy.org.uk/what-to-know-more/why-does-the-salvation-army-not-baptise-or-hold-communion/ |title=Why Does the Salvation Army Not Baptize or Hold Communion Services? |publisher=Waterbeachsalvationarmy.org.uk |date=1987-02-28 |accessdate=2019-05-16}}</ref>

Emphasizing the inward spiritual experience of their adherents over any outward ritual, [[Quakers]] (members of the Religious Society of Friends) generally do not baptize or observe Communion.<ref>[http://www.fgcquaker.org/explore/faqs-about-quakers#Sacraments How do Quakers Practice Baptism and Communion?]</ref>

==Practice and customs==
===Open and closed communion===
{{Main|Open communion|Closed communion|Full communion}}
[[File:Eucharist001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|In the [[Latin Church|Western]] [[Catholic Church]], the administration of the Eucharist to children requires that they have sufficient knowledge and careful preparation to receive the body of Christ with faith and devotion.]]
[[Christianity|Christian]] denominations differ in their understanding of whether they may celebrate the Eucharist with those with whom they are not in [[full communion]]. The apologist [[Saint]] [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 150) wrote of the Eucharist "of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined."<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm Justin Martyr, ''The First Apology'', chapter 66]</ref> This was continued in the practice of dismissing the [[catechumen]]s (those still undergoing instruction and not yet baptized) before the sacramental part of the liturgy, a custom which has left traces in the expression "[[Mass of the Catechumens]]" and in the [[Byzantine Rite]] exclamation by the deacon or priest, "The doors! The doors!", just before recitation of the Creed.<ref>[https://oca.org/reflections/berzonsky/the-doors Orthodox Church in America, "The Doors"]</ref>

Churches such as the [[Catholic]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches practice [[closed communion]] under normal circumstances. However, the Catholic Church allows administration of the Eucharist, at their spontaneous request, to properly disposed members of the eastern churches ([[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Church of the East]]) not in full communion with it and of other churches that the [[Holy See]] judges to be sacramentally in the same position as these churches; and in grave and pressing need, such as danger of death, it allows the Eucharist to be administered also to individuals who do not belong to these churches but who share the Catholic Church's faith in the reality of the Eucharist and have no access to a minister of their own community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 844 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2019-05-16}}</ref> Some [[Protestant]] communities exclude non-members from Communion.

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA) practices open communion, provided those who receive are baptized,<ref>[http://www.religionresourcesonline.org/different-types-of-religion/evangelical-lutheran.php Evangelical Lutheran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707222431/http://www.religionresourcesonline.org/different-types-of-religion/evangelical-lutheran.php |date=7 July 2011 }}.

Retrieved 2016–12–28.</ref> The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]], the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], the [[Church of Sweden]], and many other [[Lutheran]] churches outside of the US also practice open communion.
Some use the term "close communion" for restriction to members of the same denomination, and "closed communion" for restriction to members of the local congregation alone.

Most [[Protestant]] communities including [[Congregational churches]], the [[Church of the Nazarene]], the [[Assemblies of God]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], most [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] and [[Baptist]]s, [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], and [[Churches of Christ]] and other [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational churches]] practice various forms of [[open communion]].  Some churches do not limit it to only members of the congregation, but to any person in attendance (regardless of Christian affiliation) who considers himself/herself to be a Christian.  Others require that the communicant be a baptized person, or a member of a church of that denomination or a denomination of "like faith and practice". Some Progressive Christian congregations offer communion to any individual who wishes to commemorate the life and teachings of Christ, regardless of religious affiliation.<ref>In most United Church of Christ local churches, the Communion Table is "open to all Christians who wish to know the presence of Christ and to share in the community of God's people". (Book of Worship). [http://www.ucc.org/worship/communion/ Holy Communion: A Practice of Faith in the United Church of Christ]</ref>

In the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]], those who do not receive Holy Communion may enter the communion line with their arms crossed over their chest, in order to receive a [[blessing]] from the priest, instead of receiving Holy Communion.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Episcopal Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C_s5hetFBYoC&pg=PA24|date=1 September 2008|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|quote=Pastoral blessings are often available for children or adults who are not communing. Simply cross your arms over your chest if you wish to receive a blessing.|isbn=978-0819223296}}</ref> As a matter of local convention, this practice can also be found in Catholic churches in the United States for Catholics who find themselves, for whatever reason, not in a position to receive the Eucharist itself, as well as for non-Catholics, who are not permitted to receive it.

Most Latter-Day Saint churches practice closed communion; one notable exception is the [[Community of Christ]], the second-largest denomination in this movement.<ref>[http://www.cofchrist.org/sacraments/communion.asp Community of Christ: Communion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226040957/http://www.cofchrist.org/sacraments/communion.asp |date=26 February 2011 }}</ref> While The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the largest of the LDS denominations) technically practice a closed communion, their official direction to local Church leaders (in Handbook 2, section 20.4.1, last paragraph) is as follows: "Although the sacrament is for Church members, the bishopric should not announce that it will be passed to members only, and nothing should be done to prevent nonmembers from partaking of it."<ref>{{cite web |title=20.

===Preparation===
{{Main|Eucharistic discipline}}

====Catholic====
The Catholic Church requires its members to receive the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]] of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance or Reconciliation]] before taking Communion if they are aware of having committed a [[mortal sin]]<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P39.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 916] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628182123/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P39.HTM |date=28 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html#TITULUS_XVI Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 711] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130144307/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html#TITULUS_XVI |date=30 November 2012 }}</ref> and to prepare by fasting, prayer, and other works of piety.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html#TITULUS_XVI Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 713] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130144307/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html#TITULUS_XVI |date=30 November 2012 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P39.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 919] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628182123/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P39.HTM |date=28 June 2011 }}</ref>

====Eastern Orthodox====
Traditionally, the Eastern Orthodox church has required its members to have observed all church-appointed fasts (most weeks, this will be at least Wednesday and Friday) for the week prior to partaking of communion, and to fast from all food and water from midnight the night before.  In addition, Orthodox Christians are to have made a recent confession to their priest (the frequency varying with one's particular priest),<ref>[http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/communion.htm Preparing to Receive Holy Communion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721004058/http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/Communion.htm |date=21 July 2008 }}</ref> and they must be at peace with all others, meaning that they hold no grudges or anger against anyone.<ref name="How to Prepare for the Eucharist">[http://www.stgeorgegoc.org/eucharist.html How to Prepare for the Eucharist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509063618/http://www.stgeorgegoc.org/eucharist.html |date=9 May 2013 }}</ref> In addition, one is expected to attend [[Vespers]] or the [[All-Night Vigil]], if offered, on the night before receiving communion.<ref name="How to Prepare for the Eucharist"/> Furthermore, various pre-communion prayers have been composed, which many (but not all) Orthodox churches require or at least strongly encourage members to say privately before coming to the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlukeorthodox.com/html/parishinfo/preparation.cfm |title=Preparation for Holy Communion |publisher=Stlukeorthodox.com |date=2001-02-04 |accessdate=2019-05-16}}</ref>

====Protestant confessions====
Many Protestant congregations generally reserve a period of time for self-examination and private, silent confession just before partaking in the Lord's Supper.

====Footwashing====
Seventh-day Adventists, [[Mennonites]], and some other groups participate in "[[Maundy (foot washing)|foot washing]]" (cf. {{Bibleref2|John|13:3–17}}) as a preparation for partaking in the Lord's Supper. At that time they are to individually examine themselves, and confess any sins they may have between one and another.

===Adoration===
{{Further|Eucharistic adoration}}
[[File:Eucharistic Adoration.jpg|thumb|upright|The Eucharist displayed in a [[monstrance]], flanked by candles]]
Eucharistic adoration is a practice in the Roman Catholic, Anglo-Catholic and some Lutheran traditions, in which the [[#Other terms|Blessed Sacrament]] is exposed to and adored by the faithful. When this exposure and adoration is constant (twenty-four hours a day), it is called ''Perpetual Adoration''. In a parish, this is usually done by volunteer parishioners; in a [[monastery]] or convent, it is done by the resident [[monk]]s or [[nun]]s. In the ''Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament'', the Eucharist is displayed in a [[monstrance]], typically placed on an altar, at times with a light focused on it, or with candles flanking it.

===Health issues===
====Gluten====
{{Main|Coeliac disease#Christian churches and the Eucharist}}
The [[gluten]] in wheat bread is dangerous to people with [[celiac disease]] and other [[gluten-related disorders]], such as [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity]] and [[wheat allergy]].<ref name=MulderWanrooijQuotation>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mulder CJ, van Wanrooij RL, Bakker SF, Wierdsma N, Bouma G |title=Gluten-free diet in gluten-related disorders |journal=Dig.

(…) After the confirmation of NCGS diagnosis, according to the previously mentioned work-up, patients are advized to start with a GFD [49].}}</ref> For the Catholic Church, this issue was addressed in the 24 July 2003 [http://www.adoremus.org/CDF_Lowgluten-mustum2003.html letter] of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], which summarized and clarified earlier declarations. The Catholic Church believes that the matter for the Eucharist must be wheaten bread and fermented wine from grapes: it holds that, if the gluten has been entirely removed, the result is not true wheaten bread.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/Liturgy/zlitur47.htm |title=Gluten-free Hosts |accessdate=2008-04-22 |last=McNamara |first= Father Edward |date=2004-09-14 |work= ZENIT International News Agency}}</ref> For celiacs, but not generally, it allows low-gluten bread. It also permits Holy Communion to be received under the form of either bread or wine alone, except by a priest who is celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant.<ref>The same 24 July 2003 letter of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].</ref> Many Protestant churches offer communicants gluten-free alternatives to wheaten bread, usually in the form of a rice-based cracker or gluten-free bread.<ref>Jax Peter Lowell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRhm1A2_EkkC#v=twopage&q&f=false ''The Gluten-Free Bible''], p. 279.</ref>

====Alcohol====
{{See also|Christianity and alcohol}}
The Catholic Church believes that grape juice that has not begun even minimally to ferment cannot be accepted as wine, which it sees as essential for celebration of the Eucharist. For non-alcoholics, but not generally, it allows the use of [[mustum]] (grape juice in which fermentation has begun but has been suspended without altering the nature of the juice), and it holds that "since Christ is sacramentally present under each of the species, communion under the species of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. For pastoral reasons, this manner of receiving communion has been legitimately established as the most common form in the Latin rite."<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1390] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616060732/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM |date=16 June 2012 }}</ref>

As already indicated, the one exception is in the case of a priest celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant. The water that in the [[Roman Rite]] is prescribed to be mixed with the wine must be only a relatively small quantity.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3A.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 924 §1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204185953/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3A.HTM |date=4 December 2010 }}</ref> The practice of the [[Coptic Church]] is that the mixture should be two parts wine to one part water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/thecopticchurch/sacraments/4_eucharist.html |title=Sacrament of the Eucharist: Rite of Sanctification of the Chalice |publisher=Copticchurch.net |accessdate=2019-05-16}}</ref>

Many Protestant churches allow clergy and communicants to take [[mustum]] instead of wine. In addition to, or in replacement of wine, some churches offer grape juice which has been [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] to stop the fermentation process the juice naturally undergoes; de-alcoholized wine from which most of the alcohol has been removed (between 0.5% and 2% remains), or water.<ref>Compare John Howard Spahr, [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1605 I Smell the Cup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921224625/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1605 |date=21 September 2008 }}, ''Christian Century'', 12 March 1974, pp. 257–59.</ref> Exclusive use of unfermented grape juice is common in [[Baptist]] churches, the [[United Methodist Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]], [[Churches of Christ]], [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)]], some [[Lutherans]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Pentecostals]], [[Evangelicals]], the [[Christian Missionary Alliance]], and other American [[Nondenominational Christianity|independent]] Protestant churches.

====Transmission of diseases====
{{See also|Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on religion}}
Risk of infectious disease transmission related to use of a common communion cup exists but it is low. No case of transmission of an infectious disease related to a common communion cup has ever been documented. Experimental studies have demonstrated that infectious diseases can be transmitted. The most likely diseases to be transmitted would be common viral illnesses such as the [[common cold]]. A study of 681 individuals found that taking communion up to daily from a common cup did not increase the risk of infection beyond that of those who did not attend services at all.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Risk of Infectious Disease Transmission from a Common Communion Cup |first1=Lilia P. |last1=Manangan |first2=Lynne M. |last2=Sehulster |first3=Linda |last3=Chiarello |first4=Dawn N. |last4=Simonds |first5=William R. |last5=Jarvis |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |date=October 1998 |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=538–39 |url=http://www.ntnl.org/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/470-common-cup-cdc |doi=10.1016/s0196-6553(98)70029-x |pmid=9795685 |access-date=2 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203012335/http://www.ntnl.org/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/470-common-cup-cdc |archive-date=3 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Pellerin | first1 = J. | last2 = Edmond | first2 = M.

In influenza epidemics, some churches suspend the giving wine at communion, for fear of spreading the disease. This is in full accord with Catholic Church belief that communion under the form of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. However, the same measure has also been taken by churches that normally insist on the importance of receiving communion under both forms. This was done in 2009 by the [[Church of England]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/archbishops.advise.against.sharing.chalice.during.swine.flu.pandemic/23882.htm |title=Archbishops advise against sharing chalice during swine flu pandemic |publisher=Christiantoday.com |date=2009-07-27 |accessdate=2019-05-16}}</ref>

Some fear contagion through the handling involved in distributing the hosts to the communicants, even if they are placed on the hand rather than on the tongue. Accordingly, some churches use mechanical wafer dispensers or "pillow packs" (communion wafers with wine inside them). While these methods of distributing communion are not generally accepted in Catholic parishes, one parish provides a mechanical dispenser to allow those intending to commune to place in a bowl, without touching them by hand, the hosts for use in the celebration.<ref>{{cite news| first= Sumathi |last=Reddy |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704415104576065982762908782 |title= Hands Off After Wafer Scare| newspaper= Wall Street Journal| date=7 January 2011| accessdate=2012-10-12}}</ref>
