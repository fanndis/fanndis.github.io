[[File: BARCLAY FARM HOUSE.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Barclay Farm House]], built in 1816 and added to the U.S. [[United States National Register of Historic Places|National Register of Historic Places]] on January 26, 1978]]
The area now known as Cherry Hill was originally settled by the [[Lenape|Lenni-Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] before being displaced by the first settlers from [[England]], namely [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] followers of [[William Penn]] who arrived in the late 17th century.<ref>[http://www.cherryhill-nj.com/907/History-of-the-Farmstead History of the Farmstead], Cherry Hill Township. Accessed September 4, 2015.</ref> The first settlement was a small cluster of homes named Colestown, in the perimeters of what is now the [[Colestown Cemetery, Cherry Hill Township|Colestown Cemetery]] on the corner of [[New Jersey Route 41|Route 41]] (King's Highway) and Church Road. The municipality was founded on February 25, 1844, in [[Gloucester County, New Jersey|Gloucester County]] as Delaware Township from half of the area of [[Waterford Township, New Jersey|Waterford Township]], and became part of Camden County at its creation some two weeks later on March 13, 1844.<ref name=Story>Snyder, John P.[https://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/enviroed/oldpubs/bulletin67.pdf ''The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968''], Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 103 re Camden County, p. 104 re Cherry Hill Township, p. 105 re Delaware Township. Accessed March 14, 2012.</ref> Portions of the township were taken to form [[Stockton Township, New Jersey|Stockton Township]] (February 23, 1859) and [[Merchantville, New Jersey|Merchantville]] (March 3, 1874).<ref name=Story/> At its territorial peak, Delaware Township included all of modern-day Cherry Hill Township, as well as the neighborhood of [[North Camden]] and the municipalities of Merchantville and [[Pennsauken Township, New Jersey|Pennsauken]] (including Petty's Island in the [[Delaware River]]).

The township's population grew rapidly after [[World War II]], and continued to increase until the 1980s. Today, the municipality's population is stable with new development generally occurring in pockets of custom luxury houses or through the rehabilitation and [[adaptive reuse]] of commercial and industrial areas.

===Origin of the name===
Cherry Hill was a 19th-century farm on Kaighn Avenue ([[New Jersey Route 38|Route 38]]), owned by [[Abraham Browning]]. The farm property later became the Cherry Hill Inn (now an [[AMC Theatres]] Cherry Hill 24 [[movie theater]] complex), as well as an office campus (now a shopping center with [[big-box store|big-box]] retailers), and today's Cherry Hill Towers and Cherry Hill Estates housing developments.<ref>[http://www.cherryhill-nj.com/DocumentCenter/Home/View/499 History], Cherry Hill Township. Accessed September 4, 2015.</ref>

Adding to the prevalence of the Cherry Hill name, developer [[Eugene Mori]] branded several properties using the name, including the Cherry Hill Inn and Cherry Hill Lodge hotels, Cherry Hill Apartments, and Cherry Hill Estates.<ref>Cady, Steve. [https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/09/archives/eugene-mori-77-tracks-founder-garden-state-owner-dead-had-hialeah.html "Eugene Mori, 77, Track's Founder; Garden State Owner Dead Had Hialeah Interests"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 9, 1975.

Accessed July 17, 2011. "We, too, paid a visit to the Cherry Hill Shopping Center, which is an innovation in modern shopping. There are nearly 75 stores under one roof, lining an indoor mall where tropical plants grown and tropical birds play."</ref>

When the township sought a new post office, another New Jersey municipality in [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon County]] was using the name [[Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Delaware Township]].  The United States Postal Service insisted on a name change, suggesting "Deltown". Delaware Township mayors Christian Weber and John Gilmour pursued public write-in campaigns to select possible titles, and chose Cherry Hill from suggestions that included Chapel Hill, Cherry Valley and Delaware City.<ref>Staff.

The Cherry Hill post office, at the Ellisburg Circle, was established in 1961 and made the name official.... Other names under consideration included Cherry Valley, Delaware City and Chapel Hill."</ref> The name "Cherry Hill" was chosen by the township's citizens in a non-binding [[referendum]] in 1961, and was officially adopted November 7, 1961.<ref name=Story/>

==Government==

===Local government===
Created as Delaware Township in 1844, the community was first governed by a Township Committee. On May 19, 1951, the citizens adopted, in a special election, a [[Walsh Act]] Commission form of government, consisting of a three-member Board of Commissioners. In 1962, the Township's population passed the 30,000 mark and two additional Commissioners were elected. Following a study made by a Citizen's Advisory Committee, a special election was held in 1962.<ref name=LocalGovt>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120229171210/http://www.cherryhill-nj.com/about/gov-structure.asp About Us: Government Structure], Cherry Hill Township, backed up by the [[Internet Archive]] as of February 29, 2012.

Five Council members were elected at-large in a May election to serve concurrent four-year terms. The Council members elected one of their own as Mayor, and a Township Manager served as the Chief Administrator of the Township.<ref name=LocalGovt/>

By 1975, after a [[Charter Study Commission]] report and the passage of a ballot referendum, the township adopted the Council-Manager Plan B form of government. Two features of the government were changed: council members were to be elected every two years for overlapping terms of four years and the number of Council members would increase from five to seven.<ref name=LocalGovt/>

After a 1981 referendum, the government changed yet again, this time to a [[Faulkner Act (mayor–council)|Mayor-Council]] Plan B form of government. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 565) statewide that use this form of government.<ref>[https://cgs.rutgers.edu/sites/cgs.rutgers.edu/files/documents/resources/rc_munichart_inventory_2011.pdf ''Inventory of Municipal Forms of Government in New Jersey''], [[Rutgers University]] Center for Government Studies, July 1, 2011.
