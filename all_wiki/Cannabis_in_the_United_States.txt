Medical use is a common reason why people use marijuana. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, "The term medical marijuana refers to using the whole unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat a disease or symptom." However, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not officially approved [[medicinal cannabis|marijuana as a medicine]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana-medicine |title=Marijuana as Medicine |publisher=[[National Institute on Drug Abuse]]}}</ref>

[[File:White pineapple cart.jpg|thumb|Alaskan cannabis extract]]
Until the passage of the [[2018 United States farm bill]], under federal law, it was illegal to possess, use, buy, sell, or cultivate cannabis in all United States jurisdictions, since the [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970|Controlled Substances Act of 1970]] classified marijuana as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I drug]], claiming it has a high potential for abuse and has no acceptable medical use. Despite this federal prohibition, some state and local governments established laws attempting to decriminalize cannabis, which has reduced the number of "simple possession" offenders sent to jail, since federal law enforcement rarely targets individuals directly for such relatively minor offenses. Other state and local governments ask law enforcement agencies to limit enforcement of drug laws with respect to cannabis. However, under the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], federal law preempts conflicting state and local laws. In most cases, the absence of a state law does not present a preemption conflict with a federal law.

The federal government criminalized marijuana under the [[Interstate Commerce Clause]], and the application of these laws to intrastate commerce were addressed squarely by the United States Supreme Court in ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'', 352 F. 3d 1222 in 2005.

In January 2009, President [[Barack Obama]]'s transition team organized a poll to clarify some of the top issues the American public wants to have his administration look into, and two of the top ten ideas were to legalize the use of cannabis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://citizensbriefingbook.change.gov/ideas/ideaList.apexp?c=09a800000004fo6&lsi=2 |title=- Retrieved 20 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120001947/http://citizensbriefingbook.change.gov/ideas/ideaList.apexp?c=09a800000004fo6&lsi=2 |archive-date=January 20, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref> In July 2009, [[Gil Kerlikowske]], Director of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], clarified the federal government's position when he stated that "marijuana is dangerous and has no medicinal benefit" and that "legalization is not in the president's vocabulary, and it's not in mine."<ref name="komonews">{{cite web|url=http://komonews.com/news/local/kerlikowske-legal-pot-not-in-my-vocabulary |title=Kerlikowske: Legal pot 'not in my vocabulary' |publisher=KOMO News |date=August 7, 2009 |access-date=July 21, 2016}}</ref> However, a January 2010 settlement between the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and the [[Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana]] (WAMM) provided an example confirming the administration policy as communicated by Attorney General [[Eric Holder]], as WAMM reached an agreement that allowed them to re-open after being shut down by the federal government in 2002.<ref name="mercurynews">{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_14247895?nclick_check=1 |title=Santa Cruz medical pot collective settles lawsuit with feds - San Jose Mercury News |work=Mercurynews.com |access-date=September 15, 2010}}</ref><ref name="insidebayarea">{{cite web|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_14247903 |title=Santa Cruz medical pot collective settles lawsuit with feds |publisher=Inside Bay Area |access-date=September 15, 2010}}</ref>

Following the 2012 presidential election, the Office of National Drug Control Policy under the [[Obama administration]] stated that it "steadfastly opposes legalization of marijuana and other drugs because legalization would increase the availability and use of illicit drugs, and pose significant health and safety risks".<ref name="president">{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/marijuanainfo |title=Marijuana Resource Center |publisher=Office of National Drug Control Policy}}</ref> In February 2014, the administration issued guidelines to banks for conducting transactions with legal marijuana sellers so these new businesses can stash away savings, make payroll, and pay taxes like any other enterprise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-issues-roadmap-banks-marijuana-business |title=Feds Let Banks and Marijuana Sellers Do Business |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214193859/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-issues-roadmap-banks-marijuana-business |archive-date=February 14, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> However, marijuana businesses still lack access to banks and credit unions due to [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] regulations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.regblog.org/2015/09/22/schlabs-marijuana-industry-banking/|title=The Marijuana Industry's Access to Banks}}</ref>

On August 29, 2013, the Justice Department adopted a new policy (known as the [[Cole Memorandum|Cole memo]]) regarding the enforcement of federal law in states that have legalized non-medical cannabis.  The policy specified that commercial distribution of cannabis would be generally tolerated, except in certain circumstances, such as if violence or firearms are involved, the proceeds go to gangs and cartels, or if the cannabis is distributed to states where it is illegal.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rough|first1=Lisa|title=The Cole Memo: What Is It and What Does It Mean?|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-the-cole-memo|access-date=January 11, 2018|work=Leafly|date=September 14, 2017}}</ref>

On December 11, 2014, the Department of Justice told U.S. attorneys to allow Native American tribes on reservations to grow and sell marijuana, even in states where it is illegal. The policy will be implemented on a case-by-case basis and tribes must still follow federal guidelines.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Phelps, Timothy M. |access-date=December 12, 2014|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-marijuana-indians-20141211-story.html |title=U.S. won't stop Native Americans from growing, selling pot on their lands|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

On May 30, 2014, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed the [[Rohrabacher–Farr amendment]], prohibiting the Justice Department from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state medical marijuana laws. The amendment became law in December 2014, and must be renewed each year in order to remain in effect.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sullum|first1=Jacob|title=The Federal Ban on Medical Marijuana Was Not Lifted|url=http://reason.com/archives/2016/01/04/the-federal-ban-on-medical-marijuana-was|access-date=February 7, 2017|work=Reason|date=January 4, 2016}}</ref>

On March 10, 2015, U.S. Senators [[Rand Paul]], [[Kirsten Gillibrand]], and [[Cory Booker]] introduced the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States Act or CARERS Act. The bipartisan bill would move cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule II of the [[Controlled Substances Act]]. This would allow states with [[medical cannabis]] laws to legally prescribe it, and allow for much easier research into its medical efficacy. The bill would also allow grow sites besides the University of Mississippi, which has long been the sole supplier of cannabis for academic research, to supply cannabis for study.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=David|title=Senators Introduce Bill To End Federal Curbs On Medical Marijuana|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2015/03/11/is-congress-planning-to-legalize-marijuana/|work=Forbes|access-date=March 12, 2015}}</ref>

Many officials point to the difficulty of regulating dosage of cannabis (a problem for treatment as well as research), despite the availability (in [[Cannabis in Canada|Canada]] and the [[Cannabis in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]) of dosage-controlled Sativex. The United States has also pressured other governments (especially Canada and [[Cannabis in Mexico|Mexico]], with which it shares borders) to retain restrictions on marijuana.

On January 4, 2018, the [[Cole Memorandum|Cole memo]] was rescinded by Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]], restoring the ability of US Attorneys to enforce federal law in states that have legalized non-medical cannabis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/marijuana-legalization-justice-department-prosecutions.html|title=Trump Administration Takes Step That Could Threaten Marijuana Legalization Movement|first1=Charlie|last1=Savage|first2=Jack|last2=Healy|date=January 6, 2018|access-date=January 6, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

== Research ==
The National Center for Natural Products Research in [[Oxford, Mississippi]] is the only facility in the United States that is federally licensed by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] to cultivate cannabis for scientific research.  The facility is part of the School of Pharmacy at the [[University of Mississippi]], and cultivates cannabis through a contract with the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], to which it provides the cannabis.

The federal government has so far refused to grant any other licenses for the cultivation of cannabis, which has had a hindering effect on the amount of research conducted.<ref>{{citation|last1=Hudak|first1=John|last2=Wallack|first2=Grace|title=Ending the U.S. government's war on medical marijuana research|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ending-the-US-governments-war-on-medical-marijuana-research.pdf|work=Center for Effective Public Management at Brookings|publisher=The Brookings Institution|date=October 2015}}</ref>  The cannabis supplied by NIDA has been criticized by researchers for a variety of reasons, including high amounts of stems and seeds,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Fred|title=DEA Upholds Grower's Marijuana Monopoly|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2004/12/18/dea-upholds-grower-s-marijuana-monopoly/|access-date=January 11, 2018|work=CounterPunch|date=December 18, 2014}}</ref> high mold and yeast levels,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hellerman|first1=Caleb|title=Scientists say the government's only pot farm has moldy samples — and no federal testing standards|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/scientists-say-governments-pot-farm-moldy-samples-no-guidelines/|access-date=January 11, 2018|work=PBS|date=March 8, 2017}}</ref> low THC content,<ref name="DPA decades">{{citation|title=The DEA: Four Decades of Impeding And Rejecting Science|url=https://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA-MAPS_DEA_Science_Final.pdf|publisher=Drug Policy Alliance / Multidisciplinary Associations for Psychedelic Studies|date=June 2014}}</ref> and low diversity of strains available.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hudak|first1=John|title=The DEA's marijuana decision is more important than rescheduling|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/08/11/the-deas-marijuana-decision-is-more-important-than-rescheduling/|access-date=January 11, 2018|work=The Brookings Institution|date=August 11, 2016}}</ref>  NIDA has also been criticized for the length of time in which it responds to proposals, and for favoring research on the harms caused by cannabis over research on the health benefits of cannabis.<ref>{{citation|title=The Obstruction Of Medical Cannabis Research In The U.S.|url=http://american-safe-access.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Research_Obstruction_Report.pdf|publisher=Americans for Safe Access|date=April 2009}}</ref>  In August 2016, the DEA announced intention to grant additional cultivation licenses, but as of July 2017, 25 applications had been submitted to the DEA and none had been approved, with no timeline given by the DEA for the approval of any licenses.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Staggs|first1=Brooke Edwards|title=DEA hasn't loosened marijuana cultivation monopoly while applications from researchers mount|url=http://www.thecannifornian.com/cannabis-health/research-studies/dea-hasnt-loosened-marijuana-cultivation-monopoly-applications-researchers-mount/|access-date=January 11, 2018|work=The Cannifornian|date=July 2, 2017}}</ref>

According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's annual Uniform Crime Report, there have been over twelve million cannabis arrests in the United States since 1996, including 749,825 persons for marijuana violations in 2012. Of those charged with marijuana violations in 2012, 658,231 (88%) were charged with possession only. The remaining 91,593 individuals were charged with "sale/manufacture", a category that does not differentiate for cultivation offenses, even those where the marijuana was being grown for personal or medical use. Marijuana arrests comprise almost one-half (48.3 percent) of all drug arrests reported in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/persons-arrested/persons-arrested |title=Drug Crimes in the U.S.|publisher=Fbi.gov}}</ref> According to the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], there were 8.2 million marijuana arrests from 2001 to 2010, and 88% of those arrests were just for having marijuana with them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/gallery/marijuana-arrests-numbers |title=Marijuana Arrests by the Numbers |publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]}}</ref>

In July 2016, delegates at the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]] voted to approve a [[party platform]] calling for cannabis to be removed from the list of Schedule I substances, as well as calling for a "reasoned pathway for future legalization".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hotakainen|first1=Rob|title=Democrats become first major party to back pathway to legalizing pot|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article91968027.html|access-date=January 11, 2018|work=McClatchy|date=July 26, 2016}}</ref>

==Polling==
Gallup began polling the public as to the issue of legalizing cannabis in 1969; in that year 12% were in favor.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Michael |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/196550/support-legal-marijuana.aspx |title=Support for Legal Marijuana Use Up to 60% in U.S. |publisher=Gallup |access-date=November 20, 2016}}</ref> The 2017 Gallup poll showed a record high of 64% in favor of legalizing cannabis, including a majority of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ingraham|first1=Christopher|title=For the first time, a majority of Republicans support marijuana legalization|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/25/for-the-first-time-a-majority-of-republicans-support-marijuana-legalization/|access-date=January 11, 2018|work=The Washington Post|date=October 25, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, the same poll increased to an all-new high of 68%, showing that the great majority of Americans favored legalizing recreational marijuana.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Inc|first=Gallup|date=2020-11-09|title=Support for Legal Marijuana Inches Up to New High of 68%|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/323582/support-legal-marijuana-inches-new-high.aspx|access-date=2020-12-03|website=Gallup.com|language=en}}</ref>

According to a 2013 survey by [[Pew Research Center]], a majority of Americans favored complete or partial legalization of cannabis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2013/04/04/majority-now-supports-legalizing-marijuana/|title=Majority Now Supports Legalizing Marijuana|date=April 4, 2013|work=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|access-date=November 9, 2015}}</ref>  The survey showed 52% of respondents support cannabis legalization and 45% do not. College graduates' support increased from 39% to 52% in just three years, the support of self-identified conservative Republicans (a group not traditionally supportive of cannabis legalization) had increased to nearly 30%, and bipartisan support had increased across the board.  The 2018 version of the poll showed public support had increased to 61%.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Geiger|first1=Abigail|title=About six-in-ten Americans support marijuana legalization|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/05/americans-support-marijuana-legalization/|access-date=January 11, 2018|work=Pew Research Center|date=January 5, 2018}}</ref>

Attitudes regarding marijuana regulation changed as some states (Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Maine, and Alaska) passed their own laws legalizing marijuana for recreational use. According to a Gallup Poll published in December 2012, 64% of Americans believe the federal government should not intervene in these states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/159152/americans-federal-gov-state-marijuana-laws.aspx|title=Americans Want Federal Gov't Out of State Marijuana Laws|access-date=April 4, 2013}}</ref>

A 2018 study in [[Social Science Research]] found that the main determinants of these changes in attitudes toward marijuana regulation since the 1990s were a decline in perception of the riskiness of marijuana, changes in media framing of marijuana, a decline in overall punitiveness, and a decrease in religious affiliation.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://storage.googleapis.com/wzukusers/user-26857839/documents/5c19077499cfdngrg4ST/Full%20document.pdf|title = How and why have attitudes about cannabis legalization changed so much?|last1 = Felson|first1 = Jacob|last2 = Adamczyk|first2 = Amy|last3 = Thomas|first3 = Christopher|date = 2018|journal = Social Science Research|volume = 78|pages = 12–27|doi = 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2018.12.011|access-date= 2018-12-21|pmid = 30670211}}</ref>

Marijuana legalization polled as very popular in 2019 according to three major national polls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/15/18311320/marijuana-legalization-polls-surveys-trump|title=Marijuana legalization is very popular|last=Lopez|first=German|date=2019-04-15|website=Vox|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref> In fact, research indicates that communities with legal, recreational marijuana use have seen home values rise more quickly than communities where recreational use remains illegal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://listwithclever.com/real-estate-blog/marijuana-housing-market-study/|title=Recreational Marijuana's Impact on Home Prices|date=2019-04-09|website=Clever Real Estate|language=en|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>
