'''''Good Girl Gone Bad''''' is the third [[studio album]] by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]]. It was released on May 31, 2007, by [[Def Jam Recordings]] and SRP Records. Rihanna worked with various producers on the album, including [[Tricky Stewart|Christopher "Tricky" Stewart]], [[Terius Nash|Terius "Dream" Nash]], [[Neo da Matrix]], [[Timbaland]], [[Carl Sturken]], [[Evan Rogers]] and [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]]. Inspired by [[Brandy Norwood]]'s fourth studio album ''[[Afrodisiac (Brandy album)|Afrodisiac]]'' (2004), ''Good Girl Gone Bad'' is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[dance-pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] record with 1980s music influences. Described as a turning point in Rihanna's career, it represents a departure from the Caribbean sound of her previous releases, ''[[Music of the Sun]]'' (2005) and ''[[A Girl like Me (Rihanna album)|A Girl like Me]]'' (2006). Apart from the sound, she also endorsed a new image for the release going from an innocent young woman to an edgier, more mature look.

Critics gave generally positive reviews of the album, praising its composition and Rihanna's new musical direction, though some criticized the album's lyrics and inconsistency. The album received seven [[Grammy Award]] nominations and one win in the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] category for "[[Umbrella (song)|Umbrella]]" at the [[2008 Grammy Awards|2008 ceremony]]. The album debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and sold 162,000&nbsp;copies in its first week. Certified six-times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), it sold more than 2.8&nbsp;million copies in the United States. The album reached number one in Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. As of 2017, the album had sold over 9 million copies worldwide.

''Good Girl Gone Bad'' spawned five singles, all of which hit the top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], including the international hits "Umbrella" and "[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]"; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed the former at number 412 on the magazine's [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] list. To promote the album, Rihanna embarked on her first worldwide concert tour and third overall, the [[Good Girl Gone Bad Tour]]. The album was reissued as ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded]]'' in June 2008 with three new songs, including the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one hits "[[Take a Bow (Rihanna song)|Take a Bow]]" and "[[Disturbia (song)|Disturbia]]". It was followed by Rihanna's first remix album, ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad: The Remixes]]'', in January 2009, which featured remixes from [[Moto Blanco]], [[Tony Moran]], the [[Soul Seekerz]] and the [[Wideboys]].

You feel different every album, and [at] this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo [songs]."<ref name="neyo lessons"/> The same year, Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by actress [[Charlize Theron]]'s bob cut in the 2005 science fiction thriller ''[[Æon Flux (film)|Æon Flux]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rihanna's Hair Through The Years|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-beauty/pictures/rihannas-hair-through-the-years-2012172/20926|work=[[Us Weekly]]|accessdate=October 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014182935/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-beauty/pictures/rihannas-hair-through-the-years-2012172/20926|archive-date=October 14, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Rihanna explained that she wanted to keep the audience dancing and be soulful at the same time.<ref name="neyo lessons"/> She sought to make an album that people would listen to without skipping tracks. She cited ''[[Afrodisiac (Brandy album)|Afrodisiac]]'' (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer [[Brandy Norwood]], as her main inspiration for the album.<ref name="ew">{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20043298,00.html|title=Caribbean Queen|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Watson|first=Margeaux|date=June 22, 2007|accessdate=September 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921211232/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20043298,00.html|archive-date=September 21, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album ''Good Girl Gone Bad'' because it represents her bolder and more independent image: "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore.
