== Etymology ==
=== Finland ===
{{See also|Finns#Etymology}}
The earliest written appearance of the name ''Finland'' is thought to be on three [[runestone]]s. Two were found in the Swedish province of [[Uppland]] and have the inscription ''finlonti'' ([[Runestone U 582|U 582]]). The third was found in [[Gotland]]. It has the inscription ''finlandi'' ([[Runestone G 319|G 319]]) and dates back to the 13th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arkisto.fi/ |title=National Archives Service, Finland (in English) |access-date=22 January 2007}}</ref> The name can be assumed to be related to the tribe name ''[[Finnish tribes|Finns]]'', which is mentioned at first known time AD 98 (disputed meaning).

=== Suomi ===
The name ''Suomi'' ({{Langnf|fi|2=Finnish|3=Finland}}) has uncertain origins, but a common etymology with ''saame'' ([[Sami people|Sami]], a Finno-Ugric people in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]) and ''[[Tavastia (historical province)|Häme]]'' (a province in the inland) has been suggested ([[Proto-Finnic]] [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Finnic/hämä|''*hämä'']] from older ''*šämä'', possibly loaned into Proto-Saami as [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Samic/sāmē|''*sāmē'']]), whose source could be the Proto-Baltic word [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Balto-Slavic/źemē|''*źemē'']], meaning '(low) land'.<ref>[http://www.kotikielenseura.fi/virittaja/hakemistot/jutut/1998_613.pdf kotikielenseura.fi], SUOMI (TTAVIA ETYMOLOGIOITA).</ref> According to the hypothesis, ''*sāmē'' – or ''*šämä'' directly – was loaned back into Baltic as ''*sāma-'' (compare Latvian ''sāms'' 'Finn, [[Saaremaa|Öselian]]'), from which Northern Finnic reborrowed it (perhaps via a Germanic intermediate ''*sōma-'') as ''*sōma-'' > ''*sōme-'' 'Finland'.<ref name=deSmit>{{cite web |last1=de Smit |first1=Merlijn |title=De Vanitate Etymologiae. On the origins of Suomi, Häme, Sápmi. |url=https://www.academia.edu/36858309 |website=Academia.edu |publisher=Academia, Inc. |access-date=6 September 2020 |language=en}}</ref> In addition to the close relatives of Finnish (the [[Finnic languages]]), this name is also used in the [[Baltic languages]] [[Latvian language|Latvian]] (''soms'', ''Somija'') and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] (''suomis'', ''Suomija''), although these are evidently later borrowings. An alternative hypothesis by Petri Kallio suggests the Proto-Indo-European word [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ǵʰmṓ|*''(dʰ)ǵʰm-on-'']] 'human' (cf. Gothic ''guma'', Latin ''homo''), being borrowed into Uralic as *''ćoma''.<ref name=deSmit /> Earlier theories suggested derivation from ''suomaa'' ([[fen]] land) or ''suoniemi'' (fen cape), but these are now considered outdated.

It has been suggested that the Finnish word ''Suomi'' is first attested the [[Royal Frankish Annals]] annal for 811, which mentions a person called ''Suomi'' among the Danish delegation at a peace treaty with the Franks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/annalesregnifrancorum.html|title=Annesl Regni Francorum|website=thelatinlibrary.com|access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref> If so, it is also the earliest evidence for the change from the proto-Finnic [[monophthong]] {{IPA|/oː/}} to the Finnish [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/uo/}}.<ref>{{Cite book |title=''Keskiajan suomen kielen dokumentoitu sanasto ensiesiintymisvuosineen'' |last=Heikkilä |first=Mikko K. |publisher=Mediapinta |year=2017 |isbn=978-952-236-859-1 |page=44}}</ref><ref>Mikko Heikkilä, '[https://journal.fi/sananjalka/article/download/86749/45497/ Varhaissuomen äännehistorian kronologiasta]', ''Sananjalka'', 58 (2016), 136–158 (p. 147).</ref> However, some historical linguists view this interpretation of the name as unlikely, supposing another etymology or that the spelling originated as a scribal error (in which case the sound-change {{IPA|/oː/}} > {{IPA|/uo/}} could have happened much later).<ref>Petri Kallio, '[https://journal.fi/sananjalka/article/download/66609/27008 Äännehistoriaa suomen kielen  erilliskehityksen alkutaipaleilta]', ''Sananjalka'', 59 (2017), 7–24 (p. 12).</ref>

=== Concept ===
In the earliest historical sources, from the 12th and 13th centuries, the term Finland refers to the coastal region around [[Turku]] from [[Perniö]] to [[Uusikaupunki]]. This region later became known as [[Southwest Finland|Finland Proper]] in distinction from the country name Finland. Finland became a common name for the whole country in a centuries-long process that started when the [[Catholic Church]] established a missionary diocese in [[Nousiainen]] in the northern part of the province of Suomi possibly sometime in the 12th century.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |title=Suomen museo 2003: "The Origins of Finland and Häme" |last=Salo |first=Unto |publisher=Suomen muinaismuistoyhdistys |year=2004 |isbn=978-951-9057-55-2 |location=Helsinki |page=55}}</ref>

The devastation of [[Finland during the Great Northern War]] (1714–1721) and during the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743)]] caused Sweden to begin carrying out major efforts to defend its eastern half from Russia. These 18th-century experiences created a sense of a shared destiny that when put in conjunction with the unique Finnish language, led to the adoption of an expanded concept of Finland.<ref name=UppslagsFi>{{cite web |url=http://www.uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-FinlandsHistoria1700Talet |title=Finlands historia: 1700-talet |last=Lindberg |first=Johan |date=26 May 2016 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |access-date=30 November 2017 |language=sv}}</ref>

Two Russo-Swedish wars in twenty-five years served as reminders to the Finnish people of the precarious position between Sweden and Russia. An increasingly vocal elite in Finland soon determined that Finnish ties with Sweden were becoming too costly, and following [[Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790)|Russo-Swedish War]] (1788–1790), the Finnish elite's desire to break with Sweden only heightened.<ref name="a1">{{cite book |last=Nordstrom |first=Byron J. |title=Scandinavia Since 1500 |year=2000 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis, US |isbn=978-0-8166-2098-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/scandinaviasince0000nord/page/143 143] |url=https://archive.org/details/scandinaviasince0000nord/page/143 }}</ref>

Even before the war there were conspiring politicians, among them [[Georg Magnus Sprengtporten|Col G. M. Sprengtporten]], who had supported [[Gustav III of Sweden#Coup d'état|Gustav III's coup in 1772]]. Sprengporten fell out with the king and resigned his commission in 1777. In the following decade he tried to secure Russian support for an autonomous Finland, and later became an adviser to Catherine II.<ref name="a1"/> In the spirit of the notion of [[Adolf Ivar Arwidsson]] (1791–1858), "we are not Swedes, we do not want to become Russians, let us therefore be Finns", the Finnish national identity started to become established.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lefaivre|first1=Liane|last2=Tzonis|first2=Alexander|title=Architecture of Regionalism in the Age of Globalization: Peaks and Valleys in the Flat World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkYHEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT144|year=2020|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-1-00-022106-0|page=144}}</ref>

Notwithstanding the efforts of Finland's elite and nobility to break ties with Sweden, there was no genuine independence movement in Finland until the early 20th century. As a matter of fact, at this time the Finnish peasantry was outraged by the actions of their elite and almost exclusively supported Gustav's actions against the conspirators. (The High Court of Turku condemned Sprengtporten as a traitor c. 1793.)<ref name="a1"/> The Swedish era ended in the [[Finnish War]] in 1809.

=== Russian Empire era ===
{{Main|Grand Duchy of Finland}}

[[File:Pekka Halonen - Tienraivaajia Karjalassa.jpg|thumb|''Pioneers in Karelia'' (1900) by [[Pekka Halonen]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/tQFrkK28QHoc9w|title=Pioneers in Karelia - Pekka Halonen|website=Google Arts & Culture}}</ref>]]

On 29 March 1809, having been taken over by the armies of [[Alexander I of Russia]] in the [[Finnish War]], Finland became an autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]] in the [[Russian Empire]] until the end of 1917. In 1811, Alexander I incorporated the Russian [[Vyborg Governorate|Vyborg province]] into the Grand Duchy of Finland. In 1854–1854, Finland became involved in Russia's involvement in the [[Crimean War]], when the British and French navies bombed the Finnish coast and Åland during the so-called [[Åland War]]. During the Russian era, the Finnish language began to gain recognition. From the 1860s onwards, a strong Finnish [[Ethnic nationalism|nationalist movement]] known as the [[Fennoman movement]] grew. Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland's [[national epic]] – the ''[[Kalevala]]'' – in 1835, and the Finnish language's achieving equal legal status with Swedish in 1892.

The [[Finnish famine of 1866–1868]] killed 15% of the population, making it one of the worst [[famine]]s in European history. The famine led the Russian Empire to ease financial regulations, and investment rose in following decades. Economic and political development was rapid.<ref name="equity">{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRANETSOCIALDEVELOPMENT/Resources/finland.pdf |title=Growth and Equity in Finland |publisher=World Bank}}</ref> The [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) per capita was still half of that of the United States and a third of that of Britain.<ref name="equity" />

In 1906, [[universal suffrage]] was adopted in the Grand Duchy of Finland. However, the relationship between the Grand Duchy and the Russian Empire soured when the Russian government made moves to restrict Finnish [[Autonomous area|autonomy]]. For example, the universal suffrage was, in practice, virtually meaningless, since the tsar did not have to approve any of the laws adopted by the Finnish parliament. Desire for independence gained ground, first among radical liberals<ref>Mickelsson, Rauli (2007). ''Suomen puolueet—Historia, muutos ja nykypäivä''. Vastapaino.</ref> and socialists. The case is known as the "[[Russification of Finland]]", driven by the last tsar of Russian Empire, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].<ref>Alenius, Kari.

=== Civil war and early independence ===
{{Main|Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic|Finnish Civil War}}
[[File:Firing squad in Lankipohja.jpg|thumb|[[White Guard (Finland)|White firing squad]] executing [[Red Guard (Finland)|Red soldiers]] after the [[Battle of Länkipohja]] (1918)]]
After the 1917 [[February Revolution]], the position of Finland as part of the Russian Empire was questioned, mainly by [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Social Democrats]]. Since the head of state was the [[tsar]] of Russia, it was not clear who the chief executive of Finland was after the revolution. The Parliament, controlled by social democrats, passed the so-called Power Act to give the highest authority to the Parliament. This was rejected by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] which decided to dissolve the Parliament.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/finland/15.htm The Finnish Civil War, Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress]. Countrystudies.us. Retrieved on 18 May 2016.</ref>

New elections were conducted, in which right-wing parties won with a slim majority. Some social democrats refused to accept the result and still claimed that the dissolution of the parliament (and thus the ensuing elections) were extralegal. The two nearly equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the social democratic party, were highly antagonized.

The [[October Revolution]] in Russia changed the geopolitical situation anew. Suddenly, the right-wing parties in Finland started to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of highest executive power from the Russian government to Finland, as the [[Bolsheviks]] took power in Russia. Rather than acknowledge the authority of the ''[[Independence of Finland#Power act|Power Act]]'' of a few months earlier, the right-wing government, led by [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] [[P. E. Svinhufvud]], presented [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on 4 December 1917, which was officially approved two days later by [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament]], on 6 December 1917. [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR), led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], recognized independence on 4 January 1918.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=107215&contentlan=1&culture=fi-FI | title = Uudenvuodenaatto Pietarin Smolnassa – Itsenäisyyden tunnustus 31.12.1917 | publisher = Ulkoministieriö | access-date = 14 September 2020 | language = fi }}</ref>

The treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Soviet Union included Finnish obligations, restraints, and reparations—as well as further Finnish territorial concessions in addition to those in the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] of 1940. As a result of the two wars, Finland ceded most of [[Finnish Karelia]], [[Salla]], and [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]], which amounted to 10% of its land area and 20% of its industrial capacity, including the ports of [[Vyborg]] (Viipuri) and the ice-free [[Liinakhamari]] (Liinahamari). [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|Almost the whole population, some 400,000 people]], fled these areas. The former Finnish territory now constitutes part of Russia's [[Republic of Karelia]]. Finland was never occupied by Soviet forces and it retained its independence, but at a loss of about 97,000 soldiers. The [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations demanded by the Soviet Union]] amounted to $300 million ({{Inflation|US|300|1938|fmt=c}} million in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}).

Finland rejected [[Marshall Plan|Marshall aid]], in apparent [[Finlandization|deference to Soviet desires]]. However, the United States provided secret development aid and helped the Social Democratic Party, in hopes of preserving Finland's independence.<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Hidden+help+from+across+the+Atlantic/1135223633788 Hidden help from across the Atlantic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129165823/http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Hidden+help+from+across+the+Atlantic/1135223633788 |date=29 January 2007 }}, Helsingin Sanomat</ref> Establishing trade with the Western powers, such as the United Kingdom, and paying reparations to the Soviet Union produced a transformation of Finland from a primarily [[Agriculture|agrarian]] economy to an industrialised one. [[Valmet]] was founded to create materials for war reparations. After the reparations had been paid off, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union in the framework of [[bilateral trade]].

Officially claiming to be [[Neutral country|neutral]], Finland lay in the grey zone between the [[Western world|Western countries]] and the Soviet Union. The [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|YYA Treaty]] (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance) gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics. This was extensively exploited by president [[Urho Kekkonen]] against his opponents. He maintained an effective monopoly on Soviet relations from 1956 on, which was crucial for his continued popularity. In politics, there was a tendency of avoiding any policies and statements that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. This phenomenon was given the name "[[Finlandization]]" by the West German press. During the [[Cold War]], Finland also developed into one of the centers of the [[Cold War espionage|East-West espionage]], in which both the [[KGB]] and the [[CIA]] played their parts.<ref>{{Citation|last=Ford|first=Hal|title=ESAU -LVI - ''FINLANDIZATION'' IN ACTION: HELSINKI'S EXPERIENCE WITH MOSCOW|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/esau-55.pdf|series=DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE|date=August 1972}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/eastern-approaches/2011/12/01/secret-history|title=Finland and American intelligence - Secret history|work=[[The Economist]]|date=1 December 2011|access-date=16 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://intelnews.org/2011/08/19/01-794/|title=Former Finnish diplomat reveals she worked for the CIA|first=Joseph|last=Fitsanakis|website=Intelnews.org|date=19 August 2011|access-date=16 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9692396|title=Naisia, autoja ja piilopirttejä – Norjalainen vakoili CIA:n laskuun kylmän sodan Suomessa|first=Satu|last=Helin|publisher=[[YLE]]|date=2 July 2017|access-date=16 August 2020|language=fi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2019/10/14/kylman-sodan-suomalaisagentit-kasikirjoitus|title=Kylmän sodan suomalaisagentit: käsikirjoitus|first=Kai|last=Byman|work=MOT|publisher=[[YLE]]|date=14 October 2019|access-date=16 August 2020|language=fi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.is.fi/kotimaa/art-2000005833479.html|title=Näin Neuvostoliitto vakoili Suomessa – Supo seurasi "Jakkea", joka johdatti uusille jäljille|first=Mika|last=Lehto|work=[[Ilta-Sanomat]]|date=19 September 2018|access-date=16 August 2020|language=fi}}</ref> The 1949 established [[Finnish Security Intelligence Service]] (''SUPO, Suojelupoliisi''), an operational [[Security agency|security]] authority and a police unit under the [[Ministry of the Interior (Finland)|Interior Ministry]], whose core areas of activity are [[counter-Intelligence]], [[counter-terrorism]] and [[national security]],<ref>[https://supo.fi/en/frontpage?p_p_id=fi_yja_language_version_tool_web_portlet_LanguageVersionToolMissingNotificationPortlet&_fi_yja_language_version_tool_web_portlet_LanguageVersionToolMissingNotificationPortlet_missingLanguageVersion=1 SUPO - Finnish Security Intelligence Service]</ref> also participated in this activity in some places.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://tuomioja.org/kirjavinkit/2009/09/matti-simola-toimittanut-ratakatu-12-suojelupoliisi-1949-2009-wsoy-319-s-hameenlinna-2009/|title=Salaisen palvelun tutkimuksen haasteet|last=Tuomioja|first=Erkki|date=2009-09-08|work=Tuomioja.org|access-date=2017-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024153602/https://tuomioja.org/kirjavinkit/2009/09/matti-simola-toimittanut-ratakatu-12-suojelupoliisi-1949-2009-wsoy-319-s-hameenlinna-2009/|archive-date=2017-10-24|url-status=live|language=fi-FI|trans-title=Challenges in secret service research}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10224/4054|title=The Cold War and the Politics of History|last=Rentola|first=Kimmo|publisher=Edita Publishing Ltd|year=2008|isbn=978-952-10-4637-7|editor-last=Aunesluoma|editor-first=Juhani|location=Helsinki|pages=269–289|chapter=President Urho Kekkonen of Finland and the KGB|editor-last2=Kettunen|editor-first2=Pauli|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010917/https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10224/4054|archivedate=2016-03-05}}</ref>

Despite close relations with the Soviet Union, Finland maintained a market economy. Various industries benefited from [[Bilateral trade|trade privileges]] with the Soviets, which explains the widespread support that pro-Soviet policies enjoyed among business interests in Finland. Economic growth was rapid in the postwar era, and by 1975 Finland's GDP per capita was the 15th-highest in the world. In the 1970s and '80s, Finland built one of the most extensive [[welfare state]]s in the world. Finland negotiated with the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC, a predecessor of the European Union) a treaty that mostly abolished customs duties towards the EEC starting from 1977, although Finland did not fully join. In 1981, President Urho Kekkonen's failing health forced him to retire after holding office for 25 years.

{{Main|Geography of Finland}}
{{See also|List of cities and towns in Finland|List of lakes in Finland|List of national parks of Finland|Environmental issues in Finland}}
[[File:Map of Finland-en.svg|thumb|upright|Topographic map of Finland]]
Lying approximately between latitudes [[60th parallel north|60°]] and [[70th parallel north|70° N]], and longitudes [[20th meridian east|20°]] and [[32nd meridian east|32° E]], Finland is one of the world's northernmost countries. Of world capitals, only [[Reykjavík]] lies more to the north than [[Helsinki]]. The distance from the southernmost point – [[Hanko]] in Uusimaa – to the northernmost – [[Nuorgam]] in Lapland – is {{convert|1160|km|mi}}.

Finland has about 168,000 lakes (of area larger than {{convert|500|m2|acre|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and 179,000 islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_alue_en.html |title=Statistics Finland, Environment and Natural Resources|access-date=4 April 2013}}</ref> Its largest lake, [[Saimaa]], is the fourth largest in Europe. The [[Finnish Lakeland]] is the area with the most lakes in the country; many of the major cities in the area, most notably [[Tampere]], [[Jyväskylä]] and [[Kuopio]], are located in the immediate vicinity of the large lakes. The greatest concentration of islands is found in the southwest, in the [[Archipelago Sea]] between continental Finland and the main island of Åland.

Much of the geography of Finland is a result of the Ice Age. The glaciers were thicker and lasted longer in [[Fennoscandia]] compared with the rest of Europe. Their eroding effects have left the Finnish landscape mostly flat with few hills and fewer mountains. Its highest point, the [[Halti]] at {{convert|1324|m|ft|0}}, is found in the extreme north of Lapland at the border between Finland and [[Norway]]. The highest mountain whose peak is entirely in Finland is [[Ridnitšohkka]] at 1,316&nbsp;m (4,318&nbsp;ft), directly adjacent to Halti.

[[File:Imatran kylpylä.jpg|thumb|There are some 187,888 [[List of lakes of Finland|lakes in Finland]] larger than 500 square metres and 75,818 [[List of islands of Finland|islands]] of over 0,5 km2 area.]]

The retreating glaciers have left the land with [[moraine|morainic]] deposits in formations of [[esker]]s. These are ridges of stratified gravel and sand, running northwest to southeast, where the ancient edge of the glacier once lay. Among the biggest of these are the three [[Salpausselkä]] ridges that run across southern Finland.

Having been compressed under the enormous weight of the glaciers, terrain in Finland is rising due to the [[post-glacial rebound]]. The effect is strongest around the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], where land steadily rises about {{convert|1|cm|1|abbr=on}} a year. As a result, the old sea bottom turns little by little into dry land: the surface area of the country is expanding by about {{convert|7|km2|sqmi}} annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fimr.fi/en/tutkimus/fysikaalinen-tutkimus/vedenkorkeuden-vaihteluiden-ajalliset-muutokset.html |title=Trends in sea level variability |work=Finnish Institute of Marine Research |date=24 August 2004 |access-date=22 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227172733/http://www.fimr.fi/en/tutkimus/fysikaalinen-tutkimus/vedenkorkeuden-vaihteluiden-ajalliset-muutokset.html |archive-date=27 February 2007 }}</ref> Relatively speaking, Finland is rising from the sea.<ref name="EB">"Finland."

The landscape is covered mostly by coniferous [[taiga]] forests and [[fen]]s, with little cultivated land. Of the total area 10% is lakes, rivers and ponds, and 78% forest. The forest consists of [[pine]], [[spruce]], [[birch]], and other species.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metla.fi/suomen-metsat/ |title=Euroopan metsäisin maa |date=2013 |website= Luke |language=fi |access-date=30 April 2016}}</ref> Finland is the largest producer of wood in Europe and among the largest in the world. The most common type of rock is [[granite]]. It is a ubiquitous part of the scenery, visible wherever there is no soil cover. Moraine or [[till]] is the most common type of soil, covered by a thin layer of [[humus]] of biological origin. [[Podzol]] profile development is seen in most forest soils except where drainage is poor. [[Gleysol]]s and peat [[bog]]s occupy poorly drained areas.

=== Biodiversity ===
{{Main|Fauna of Finland|Wildlife of Finland}}
[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Finland is shared between the Arctic, central European, and northern European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Scandinavian and Russian taiga]], [[Sarmatic mixed forests]], and [[Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands]]. Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland. On the southwestern coast, south of the Helsinki-[[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] line, forests are characterized by mixed forests, that are more typical in the Baltic region. In the extreme north of Finland, near the [[tree line]] and Arctic Ocean, Montane Birch forests are common.

[[File:Ähtärin karhut 7.jpg|thumb|The [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'') is Finland's national animal. It is also the largest [[carnivora]] in Finland.]]
Similarly, Finland has a diverse and extensive range of fauna. There are at least sixty native [[mammal]]ian species, 248 breeding bird species, over 70 fish species, and 11 reptile and frog species present today, many migrating from neighboring countries thousands of years ago.
Large and widely recognized wildlife mammals found in Finland are the [[brown bear]], [[gray wolf]], [[wolverine]], and [[Moose|elk]]. The brown bear, which is also nicknamed as the "king of the forest" by the Finns, is the country's official national animal,<ref>https://finland.fi/life-society/iconic-finnish-nature-symbols-stand-out/ ICONIC FINNISH NATURE SYMBOLS STAND OUT</ref> which also occur on the coat of arms of the [[Satakunta]] [[Regions of Finland|region]] is a crown-headed black bear carrying a sword,<ref>Iltanen, Jussi: ''Suomen kuntavaakunat'' (2013), Karttakeskus, {{ISBN|951-593-915-1}}</ref> possibly referring to the regional capital city of [[Pori]], whose Swedish name ''Björneborg'' and the Latin name ''Arctopolis'' literally means "bear city" or "bear fortress".<ref>https://memphismagazine.com/travel/savoring-heritage/ Savoring Heritage: A Memphis Writer explores her daughter's Finnish roots.</ref> Three of the more striking birds are the [[whooper swan]], a large European swan and the national bird of Finland; the [[Western capercaillie]], a large, black-plumaged member of the [[grouse]] family; and the [[Eurasian eagle-owl]].

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Finland}}
[[File:Finland Köppen.svg|thumb|upright|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of Finland]]

The main factor influencing Finland's climate is the country's geographical position between the 60th and 70th northern parallels in the [[Eurasia]]n continent's coastal zone. In the [[Köppen climate classification]], the whole of Finland lies in the [[subarctic climate|boreal zone]], characterized by warm summers and freezing winters. Within the country, the [[temperateness]] varies considerably between the southern coastal regions and the extreme north, showing characteristics of both a [[Oceanic climate|maritime]] and a [[continental climate]]. Finland is near enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be continuously warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]]. The Gulf Stream combines with the moderating effects of the [[Baltic Sea]] and numerous inland lakes to explain the unusually warm climate compared with other regions that share the same [[latitude]], such as [[Alaska]], [[Siberia]], and southern [[Greenland]].<ref name="Finland's climate">{{cite web |title=Finland's climate |url=http://www.fmi.fi/weather/climate.html |publisher=Finnish Meteorological Institute |access-date=3 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721105549/http://www.fmi.fi/weather/climate.html |archive-date=21 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Winters in southern Finland (when mean daily temperature remains below {{convert|0|°C|disp=or}}) are usually about 100 days long, and in the inland the snow typically covers the land from about late November to April, and on the coastal areas such as [[Helsinki]], snow often covers the land from late December to late March.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://ilmasto-opas.fi/fi/ilmastonmuutos/suomen-muuttuva-ilmasto/-/artikkeli/08848977-fd1a-4e85-8389-7ecf3ca7de7d/uusimaa-merellisen-ilmaston-maakunta.html|title = The climate in Finland (finnish)|access-date = 3 January 2015}}</ref> Even in the south, the harshest winter nights can see the temperatures fall to {{convert|-30|°C}} although on coastal areas like Helsinki, temperatures below {{convert|-30|°C|0}} are rare.

[[File:Isokuru.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pyhä-Luosto National Park]], [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]]]

In northern Finland, particularly in Lapland, the winters are long and cold, while the summers are relatively warm but short. The most severe winter days in Lapland can see the temperature fall down to {{convert|-45|°C}}. The winter of the north lasts for about 200 days with permanent snow cover from about mid-October to early May. Summers in the north are quite short, only two to three months, but can still see maximum daily temperatures above {{convert|25|°C}} during heat waves.<ref name="Finland's climate" /> No part of Finland has [[Arctic tundra]], but [[Alpine tundra]] can be found at the [[fell]]s Lapland.<ref name="Havas" />

The Finnish climate is suitable for cereal farming only in the southernmost regions, while the northern regions are suitable for [[animal husbandry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmm.fi/attachments/mmm/julkaisut/esitteet/5HIspFLpC/45920_LFA_esite.pdf|title=Finland's Northern Conditions: Challenges and Opportunities for Agriculture|publisher=Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Finland|pages=1–4|access-date=3 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407022547/http://www.mmm.fi/attachments/mmm/julkaisut/esitteet/5HIspFLpC/45920_LFA_esite.pdf|archive-date=7 April 2012 }}</ref>

A quarter of Finland's territory lies within the [[Arctic Circle]] and the [[midnight sun]] can be experienced for more days the farther north one travels. At Finland's northernmost point, the sun does not set for 73 consecutive days during summer, and does not rise at all for 51 days during winter.<ref name="Finland's climate" />

=== Regions ===
{{Main|Regions of Finland}}

Finland consists of 19 [[Regions of Finland|regions]], called {{lang|fi|maakunta}} in Finnish and {{lang|sv|landskap}} in Swedish. The regions are governed by regional councils which serve as forums of cooperation for the [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]] of a region. The main tasks of the regions are regional planning and development of enterprise and education. In addition, the public health services are usually organized on the basis of regions. Currently, the only region where a popular election is held for the council is Kainuu. Other regional councils are elected by municipal councils, each municipality sending representatives in proportion to its population.

In addition to inter-municipal cooperation, which is the responsibility of regional councils, each region has a state Employment and Economic Development Centre which is responsible for the local administration of labour, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and entrepreneurial affairs. The [[Finnish Defence Forces]] regional offices are responsible for the regional defence preparations and for the administration of conscription within the region.

Regions represent dialectal, cultural, and economic variations better than the former [[Provinces of Finland|provinces]], which were purely administrative divisions of the central government. Historically, regions are divisions of [[historical provinces of Finland]], areas which represent dialects and culture more accurately.

Six [[Regional State Administrative Agencies of Finland|Regional State Administrative Agencies]] were created by the state of Finland in 2010, each of them responsible for one of the regions called {{lang|fi|alue}} in Finnish and {{lang|sv|region}} in Swedish; in addition, Åland was designated a seventh region. These take over some of the tasks of the earlier [[Provinces of Finland]] (''lääni''/''län''), which were abolished.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avi.fi/fi/Sivut/etusivu.aspx |title=Tervetuloa aluehallintoviraston verkkosivuille! |publisher=State Provincial Office |language=fi |access-date=9 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315151138/http://www.avi.fi/fi/Sivut/etusivu.aspx |archive-date=15 March 2012 }}</ref>

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Finland|Regions of Finland|Sub-regions of Finland|Municipalities of Finland|Historical provinces of Finland}}

The fundamental administrative divisions of the country are the [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]], which may also call themselves towns or cities. They account for half of public spending. Spending is financed by municipal income tax, state subsidies, and other revenue. {{As of|2020}}, there are 310 municipalities,<ref name="Suomen Kuntaliitto" /> and most have fewer than 6,000 residents.

In addition to municipalities, two intermediate levels are defined. Municipalities co-operate in seventy [[Sub-regions of Finland|sub-regions]] and nineteen [[Regions of Finland|regions]]. These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. The autonomous province of Åland has a permanent democratically elected regional council. Sami people have a semi-autonomous [[Sami native region (Finland)|Sami native region]] in Lapland for issues on language and culture.

In the following chart, the number of inhabitants includes those living in the entire municipality (''kunta/kommun''), not just in the built-up area. The land area is given in km<sup>2</sup>, and the density in inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> (land area). The figures are as of {{#time:d F Y |{{Data Finland municipality/population count|sourcedate}}}}. The [[capital region]] – comprising [[Helsinki]], [[Vantaa]], [[Espoo]] and [[Kauniainen]] – forms a continuous [[conurbation]] of over 1.1 million people. However, common administration is limited to voluntary cooperation of all municipalities, e.g. in [[Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council]].

{{legend2|#039|the [[Eurozone]]}}
{{legend2|#039}}{{legend2|#36C|the [[European Union]]}}]]

=== Constitution ===
The [[Constitution of Finland]] defines the political system; Finland is a [[parliamentary republic]] within the framework of a [[representative democracy]]. The [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] is the country's most powerful person. The current version of the constitution was enacted on 1 March 2000, and was amended on 1 March 2012. Citizens can run and vote in parliamentary, municipal, presidential and [[Elections in the European Union|European Union elections]].

=== President ===
{{Main|President of Finland}}
The [[head of state]] of Finland is [[President of Finland|President of the Republic of Finland]] (in Finnish: ''Suomen tasavallan presidentti''; in Swedish: ''Republiken Finlands president''). Finland has had for most of its independence a [[semi-presidential system]], but in the last few decades the powers of the President have been diminished. In constitution amendments, which came into effect in 1991 or 1992 and also with a new drafted constitution of 2000, amended in 2012, the President's position has become primarily a ceremonial office. However, the President still leads the nation's foreign politics together with the Council of State and is the commander-in-chief of the Defence Forces.<ref name="Parliamentary">Formerly a semi-presidential republic, it is now a parliamentary republic according to David Arter, First Chair of Politics at Aberdeen University. In his "Scandinavian Politics Today" (Manchester University Press, revised 2008 {{ISBN|9780719078538}}), he quotes {{Cite journal |last=Nousiainen |first=Jaakko |date=June 2001 |title=From semi-presidentialism to parliamentary government: political and constitutional developments in Finland |journal=[[Scandinavian Political Studies]] |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=95–109 |doi=10.1111/1467-9477.00048 }} as follows: "There are hardly any grounds for the epithet 'semi-presidential'." Arter's own conclusions are only slightly more nuanced: "The adoption of a new constitution on 1 March 2000 meant that Finland was no longer a case of semi-presidential government other than in the minimalist sense of a situation where a popularly elected fixed-term president exists alongside a prime minister and cabinet who are responsible to parliament (Elgie 2004: 317)". According to the Finnish Constitution, the president has no possibility to rule the government without the ministerial approval, and does not have the power to dissolve the parliament under his or her own desire. Finland is actually represented by its prime minister, and not by its president, in the Council of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union. The 2012 constitutional amendments reduced the powers of the president even further.</ref> The position still does entail some powers, including responsibility for [[Foreign relations of Finland|foreign policy]] (excluding affairs related to the [[European Union]]) in cooperation with the [[Finnish Government|cabinet]], being [[Commander-in-Chief|the head of the armed forces]], some decree and pardoning powers, and some appointive powers. Direct, one- or two-stage elections are used to elect the president for a term of six years and for a maximum of two consecutive 6-year terms. The current president is [[Sauli Niinistö]]; he took office on 1 March 2012. Former presidents were [[Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg|K. J. Ståhlberg]] (1919–1925), [[Lauri Kristian Relander|L. K. Relander]] (1925–1931), [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud|P. E. Svinhufvud]] (1931–1937), [[Kyösti Kallio]] (1937–1940), [[Risto Ryti]] (1940–1944), [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|C. G. E. Mannerheim]] (1944–1946), [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|J. K. Paasikivi]] (1946–1956), [[Urho Kekkonen]] (1956–1982), [[Mauno Koivisto]] (1982–1994), [[Martti Ahtisaari]] (1994–2000), and [[Tarja Halonen]] (2000–2012)<!-- don't add Sauli Niinistö here, because he is not a former president -->.

The current president was elected from the ranks of the [[National Coalition Party]] for the first time since 1946. The presidency between 1946 and the present was instead held by a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] or the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]].

=== Parliament ===
{{Main|Parliament of Finland}}
[[File:Eduskuntatalo Helsinki.jpg|thumb|The [[Parliament of Finland]]'s main building]]

The 200-member [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Parliament of Finland]] ({{Lang-fi|Eduskunta}}, {{Lang-sv|Riksdag}}) exercises supreme legislative authority in the country. It may alter the constitution and ordinary laws, dismiss the cabinet, and override presidential vetoes. Its acts are not subject to judicial review; the constitutionality of new laws is assessed by the parliament's [[Parliament of Finland#Committees|constitutional law committee]]. The parliament is elected for a term of four years using the proportional [[D'Hondt method]] within a number of multi-seat constituencies through the [[Open list#Most open|most open list]] multi-member districts. Various parliament committees listen to experts and prepare legislation. 

Since [[universal suffrage]] was introduced in 1906, the parliament has been dominated by the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] (former Agrarian Union), the [[National Coalition Party]], and the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]]. These parties have enjoyed approximately equal support, and their combined vote has totalled about 65–80% of all votes. Their lowest common total of MPs, 121, was reached in the 2011 elections. For a few decades after 1944, the [[Communist Party of Finland|Communists]] were a strong fourth party. Due to the electoral system of proportional representation, and the relative reluctance of voters to switch their support between parties, the relative strengths of the parties have commonly varied only slightly from one election to another. However, there have been some long-term trends, such as the rise and fall of the Communists during the Cold War; the steady decline into insignificance of the [[Liberals (Finland)|Liberals]] and its predecessors from 1906 to 1980; and the rise of the [[Green League]] since 1983. In the 2010s, the [[True Finns|Finns Party]] achieved exceptional success, increasing its representation in the 2011 election from 5 to 39 seats, surpassing the Centre Party.<ref>The source for historical information on party support is [[:fi:Suomen eduskunta#Kansanedustajat puolueittain ja vaaleittain|the Finnish Wikipedia's article on the parliament]]</ref>{{circular reference|date=November 2020}}

The autonomous province of Åland, which forms a [[federacy]] with Finland, elects one member to the parliament, who traditionally joins the [[parliamentary group]] of the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]]. (The province also holds elections for its own permanent [[Parliament of Åland|regional council]], and in the [[2011 Åland legislative election|2011 elections]], [[Åland Centre]] was the largest party.)

The Parliament can be dissolved by a recommendation of the Prime Minister, endorsed by the President. This procedure has never been used, although the parliament was dissolved eight times under the pre-2000 constitution, when this action was the sole prerogative of the president.

After the [[2015 Finnish parliamentary election|parliamentary elections on 19 April 2015]], the seats were divided among eight parties as follows:<ref>{{cite web| url = http://vaalit.yle.fi/tulospalvelu/2015/eduskuntavaalit/?puolueet_##taulukko| title = Eduskuntavaalit 2015 – tulospalvelu – yle.fi| publisher = [[Yle]]| access-date = 5 June 2015}}</ref>

=== Cabinet ===
{{See also|List of Female Cabinet Ministers in Finland}}
After parliamentary elections, the parties negotiate among themselves on forming a new cabinet (the [[Finnish Government]]), which then has to be approved by a simple majority vote in the parliament. The cabinet can be dismissed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, although this rarely happens (the last time in 1957), as the parties represented in the cabinet usually make up a majority in the parliament.<ref>[[:fi:Epäluottamuslause|The Finnish Wikipedia's article on Motion of no confidence]]</ref>

The cabinet exercises most executive powers, and originates most of the bills that the parliament then debates and votes on. It is headed by the [[Prime Minister of Finland]], and consists of him or her, of other ministers, and of the [[Chancellor of Justice#Finland|Chancellor of Justice]]. The current prime minister is [[Sanna Marin]] (Social Democratic Party). Each minister heads his or her ministry, or, in some cases, has responsibility for a subset of a ministry's policy. After the prime minister, the most powerful minister is the [[Minister of Finance (Finland)|minister of finance]]. The incumbent Minister of Finance is [[Matti Vanhanen]].

As no one party ever dominates the parliament, Finnish cabinets are multi-party coalitions. As a rule, the post of prime minister goes to the leader of the biggest party and that of the minister of finance to the leader of the second biggest.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Law of Finland|Judicial system of Finland}}
[[File:Supreme Court of Finland.jpg|thumb|right|The Court House of the [[Supreme Court of Finland|Supreme Court]]]]
The judicial system of Finland is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system divided between [[court]]s with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and [[administrative court]]s with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Finnish law is codified and based on [[Judiciary of Sweden|Swedish law]] and in a wider sense, civil law or [[Roman law]]. The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts (''käräjäoikeus'', ''tingsrätt''), regional appellate courts (''hovioikeus'', ''hovrätt''), and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] (''korkein oikeus'', ''högsta domstolen''). The administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts (''hallinto-oikeus'', ''förvaltningsdomstol'') and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Administrative Court|Supreme Administrative Court]] (''korkein hallinto-oikeus'', ''högsta förvaltningsdomstolen''). In addition to the regular courts, there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration. There is also a [[Judicial system of Finland#High Court of Impeachment|High Court of Impeachment]] for criminal charges against certain high-ranking officeholders.

Around 92% of residents have confidence in Finland's security institutions.<ref name="corruptionpolicing">Policing corruption, International Perspectives.</ref> The overall [[Crime in Finland|crime rate of Finland]] is not high in the EU context. Some crime types are above average, notably the high [[homicide]] rate for Western Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/3/3e/Intentional_homicides%2C_2016_%28police-recorded_offences_per_100_000_inhabitants%29.png |title=File:Intentional homicides, 2016 (police-recorded offences per 100 000 inhabitants).png |access-date=10 December 2010}}</ref> A [[day fine]] system is in effect and also applied to offenses such as [[speeding]].

Finland has successfully fought against government corruption, which was more common in the 1970s and '80s.<ref name="corruption">The History of Corruption in Central Government By Seppo Tiihonen, International Institute of Administrative Sciences</ref>{{verify source|date=March 2011|reason=Surprising, not clear what part of the work is used.}} For instance, economic reforms and EU membership introduced stricter requirements for open bidding and many public monopolies were abolished.<ref name="corruption" /> Today, Finland has a very low number of corruption charges; [[Transparency International]] ranks Finland as one of the least corrupt countries in Europe.

In 2008, Transparency International criticized the lack of transparency of the system of Finnish political finance.<ref>[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/oikea/id90735.html Vaalijohtaja: Vaalirahoituslain rikkominen melko yleistä] YLE 15 May 2008</ref> According to [[Group of States Against Corruption|GRECO]] in 2007, corruption should be taken into account in the Finnish system of election funds better.<ref>Evaluation Report on Finland on Incriminations, Theme I, s. 21, GRECO 3–7.12.2007</ref> [[2007 campaign finance scandal of Finland|A scandal revolving around campaign finance of the 2007 parliamentary elections]] broke out in spring 2008.

=== Social security ===
{{Main|Social security in Finland}}

Finland has one of the world's most extensive welfare systems, one that guarantees decent living conditions for all residents: Finns, and non-citizens. Since the 1980s the social security has been cut back, but still the system is one of the most comprehensive in the world. Created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II, the social security system was an outgrowth of the traditional Nordic belief that the state was not inherently hostile to the well-being of its citizens, but could intervene benevolently on their behalf. According to some social historians, the basis of this belief was a relatively benign history that had allowed the gradual emergence of a free and independent peasantry in the Nordic countries and had curtailed the dominance of the nobility and the subsequent formation of a powerful right wing. Finland's history has been harsher than the histories of the other Nordic countries, but not harsh enough to bar the country from following their path of social development.<ref name="LOC">Text from PD source: US Library of Congress: ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/fitoc.html A Country Study: Finland]'', Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990.</ref>

The Finnish Defence Forces consist of a [[En cadre|cadre]] of professional soldiers (mainly officers and technical personnel), currently serving conscripts, and a large reserve. The standard readiness strength is 34,700 people in uniform, of which 25% are professional soldiers. A universal male [[conscription]] is in place, under which all male Finnish nationals above 18 years of age serve for 6 to 12 months of armed service or 12 months of civilian (non-armed) service.
Voluntary post-conscription overseas peacekeeping service is popular, and troops serve around the world in UN, NATO, and EU missions. Approximately 500 women choose voluntary military service every year.<ref>[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naisten_vapaaehtoinen_asepalvelus.dsp Women's voluntary service] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409182820/http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naisten_vapaaehtoinen_asepalvelus.dsp |date=9 April 2008 }} (in Finnish)</ref> Women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces.
The army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units. The army defends the national territory and its military strategy employs the use of the heavily forested terrain and numerous lakes to wear down an aggressor, instead of attempting to hold the attacking army on the frontier.

The term total means that all sectors of the government and economy are involved in the defence planning. The armed forces are under the command of the [[Chief of Defence (Finland)|Chief of Defence]] (currently General [[Jarmo Lindberg]]), who is directly subordinate to the president in matters related to military command.

The economy of Finland has a per capita output equal to that of other European economies such as those of France, Germany, [[Belgium]], or the UK. The largest sector of the economy is the [[service sector]] at 66% of GDP, followed by manufacturing and refining at 31%. [[Primary sector of the economy|Primary production]] represents 2.9%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_kansantalous_en.html |title=Finland in Figures—National Accounts |work=Statistics Finland |access-date=26 April 2007}}</ref> With respect to [[International trade|foreign trade]], the key economic sector is manufacturing.

Finland has significant timber, mineral ([[iron]], [[chromium]], [[copper]], [[nickel]], and [[gold]]), and freshwater resources. [[Forestry]], paper factories, and the [[Agriculture|agricultural sector]] (on which taxpayers spend{{clarify|subsidize?|date=June 2017}} around €3 billion annually) are important for rural residents so any policy changes affecting these sectors are politically sensitive for politicians dependent on rural votes. The [[Greater Helsinki]] area generates around one third of Finland's GDP. In a 2004 OECD comparison, high-technology manufacturing in Finland ranked second largest after Ireland. Knowledge-intensive services have also resulted in the smallest and slow-growth sectors – especially agriculture and low-technology manufacturing – being ranked the second largest after Ireland.<ref name="oecd2004">Finland Economy 2004, OECD</ref>

Finland's climate and soils make growing crops a particular challenge. The country lies between the latitudes 60°N and 70°N, and it has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frost. However, because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current moderate the climate, Finland contains half of the world's arable land north of 60° north latitude. Annual precipitation is usually sufficient, but it occurs almost exclusively during the winter months, making summer droughts a constant threat. In response to the climate, farmers have relied on quick-ripening and frost-resistant varieties of crops, and they have cultivated south-facing slopes as well as richer bottomlands to ensure production even in years with summer frosts. Most farmland was originally either forest or swamp, and the soil has usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralize excess acid and to improve fertility. Irrigation has generally not been necessary, but drainage systems are often needed to remove excess water. Finland's agriculture has been efficient and productive—at least when compared with farming in other European countries.<ref name="LOC" />

Forests play a key role in the country's economy, making it one of the world's leading wood producers and providing raw materials at competitive prices for the crucial wood-processing industries. As in agriculture, the government has long played a leading role in forestry, regulating tree cutting, sponsoring technical improvements, and establishing long-term plans to ensure that the country's forests continue to supply the wood-processing industries. To maintain the country's comparative advantage in forest products, Finnish authorities moved to raise lumber output toward the country's ecological limits. In 1984, the government published the Forest 2000 plan, drawn up by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The plan aimed at increasing forest harvests by about 3% per year, while conserving forestland for recreation and other uses.<ref name="LOC" />

Finland's road system is utilized by most internal cargo and passenger traffic. The annual state operated road network expenditure of around €1 billion is paid for with vehicle and fuel taxes which amount to around €1.5 billion and €1 billion, respectively. Among the [[Highways in Finland|Finnish highways]], the most significant and busiest main roads include the [[Turku Highway]] ([[European route E18|E18]]), the [[Tampere Highway]] ([[European route E12|E12]]), the [[Lahti Highway]] ([[European route E75|E75]]), and the ring roads ([[Ring I]] and [[Ring III]]) of the Helsinki metropolitan area and the [[Tampere Ring Road]] of the [[Tampere urban area]].<ref>[https://newsnowfinland.fi/domestic/top-gear-finlands-busiest-roads-revealed Top Gear: Finland’s Busiest Roads Revealed]</ref>

{{Main|Economy of Finland}}
[[File:Oasis of the Seas.jpg|thumb|The [[Oasis of the Seas]] was built at the [[Perno shipyard]] in [[Turku]].]]
Finland rapidly industrialized after World War II, achieving GDP per capita levels comparable to that of Japan or the UK in the beginning of the 1970s. Initially, most of the economic development was based on two broad groups of export-led industries, the "metal industry" (''metalliteollisuus'') and "forest industry" (''metsäteollisuus''). The "metal industry" includes shipbuilding, metalworking, the [[automotive industry]], engineered products such as motors and [[Electronics industry|electronics]], and production of metals and alloys including [[steel]], [[copper]] and [[chromium]]. Many of the world's biggest [[cruise ship]]s, including [[MS Freedom of the Seas]] and the [[Oasis of the Seas]] have been built in Finnish shipyards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oasisoftheseas.com/presskit/Oasis_of_the_Seas.pdf |title=Oasis of the Seas: Fast Facts |work=OasisoftheSeas.com |date=10 September 2009 |access-date=24 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220080037/http://www.oasisoftheseas.com/presskit/Oasis_of_the_Seas.pdf |archive-date=20 February 2012}}</ref>

In the [[pulp and paper industry]], many major companies are based in Finland; [[Ahlstrom-Munksjö]], [[Metsä Board]], and [[UPM (company)|UPM]] are all Finnish forest-based companies with revenues exceeding €1 billion. However, in recent decades, the Finnish economy has diversified, with companies expanding into fields such as electronics ([[Nokia]]), metrology ([[Vaisala]]), petroleum ([[Neste]]), and video games ([[Rovio Entertainment]]), and is no longer dominated by the two sectors of metal and forest industry. Likewise, the structure has changed, with the service sector growing, with manufacturing declining in importance; agriculture remains a minor part. Despite this, production for export is still more prominent than in Western Europe, thus making Finland possibly more vulnerable to global economic trends.

In 2017, the Finnish economy was estimated to consist of approximately 2.7% agriculture, 28.2% manufacturing and 69.1% services.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Europe :: Finland — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/fi.html|access-date=2020-06-16|website=cia.gov}}</ref> In 2019, the per-capita income of Finland was estimated to be $48,869.

Finnish law [[Universal validity of collective labour agreements|forces all workers to obey the national contracts]] that are drafted every few years for each profession and seniority level.

Finnish and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are the official languages of Finland.

In 1869, Finland was the first Nordic country to [[disestablishment|disestablish]] [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|its Evangelical Lutheran church]] by introducing the Church Act, followed by the [[Church of Sweden]] in 2000. Although the church still maintains a special relationship with the state, it is not described as a [[state religion]] in the [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish Constitution]] or other laws passed by the [[Finnish Parliament]].<ref name=FinlandConstitution>{{cite web|url=https://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html |title=Finland > Constitution: Chapter 1 Fundamental provisions (Section 76 The Church Act) |last=Tschentscher |first=Axel |date=27 June 2020}}</ref> Finland's state church was the [[Church of Sweden]] until 1809. As an autonomous Grand Duchy under Russia 1809–1917, Finland retained the Lutheran State Church system, and a state church separate from Sweden, later named the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], was established. It was detached from the state as a separate judicial entity when the new church law came to force in 1869. After Finland had gained independence in 1917, religious freedom was declared in the constitution of 1919 and a separate law on religious freedom in 1922. Through this arrangement, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland lost its position as a state church but gained a constitutional status as a national church alongside the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]], whose position however is not codified in the constitution.

Most pre-tertiary education is arranged at municipal level. Even though many or most schools were started as private schools, today only around 3 percent of students are enrolled in private schools (mostly specialist language and international schools), much less than in Sweden and most other developed countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurydice.org/ressources/Eurydice/pdf/047DN/047_NL_EN.pdf |title=Summary sheets on education systems in Europe |publisher=Eurydice.org |access-date=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910005807/http://www.eurydice.org/ressources/Eurydice/pdf/047DN/047_NL_EN.pdf |archive-date=10 September 2008 }}</ref> Pre-school education is rare compared with other EU countries and formal education is usually started at the age of 7. Primary school takes normally six years and lower secondary school three years. Most schools are managed by municipal officials.

The flexible curriculum is set by the [[Ministry of Education (Finland)|Ministry of Education]] and the Education Board. Education is compulsory between the ages of 7 and 16. After lower secondary school, graduates may either enter the workforce directly, or apply to trade schools or [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] (upper secondary schools). Trade schools offer a [[vocational education]]: approximately 40% of an age group choose this path after the lower secondary school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=FIN |title=Vocational Education in Finland |date=18 November 2013 |access-date=9 May 2014 |author=UNESCO-UNEVOC}}</ref> Academically oriented gymnasiums have higher entrance requirements and specifically prepare for [[Abitur]] and tertiary education. Graduation from either formally qualifies for tertiary education.

In tertiary education, two mostly separate and non-interoperating sectors are found: the profession-oriented polytechnics and the research-oriented universities. Education is free and living expenses are to a large extent financed by the government through [[student benefit]]s.

Finland has a long tradition of adult education, and by the 1980s nearly one million Finns were receiving some kind of instruction each year. Forty percent of them did so for professional reasons. Adult education appeared in a number of forms, such as secondary evening schools, civic and workers' institutes, study centres, vocational course centres, and folk high schools. Study centres allowed groups to follow study plans of their own making, with educational and financial assistance provided by the state. [[Folk high school]]s are a distinctly Nordic institution. Originating in Denmark in the 19th century, folk high schools became common throughout the region. Adults of all ages could stay at them for several weeks and take courses in subjects that ranged from handicrafts to economics.<ref name="LOC" />

[[File:Smoke Sauna (395139052).jpg|thumb|A [[smoke sauna]] in [[Ruka, Finland|Ruka]], [[Kuusamo]]]]
The Finns' love for [[sauna]]s is generally associated with Finnish cultural tradition in the world. Sauna is a type of dry steam bath practiced widely in Finland, which is especially evident in the strong tradition around [[Midsummer]] and [[Christmas]]. In Finland, the sauna has been a traditional cure or part of the treatment for many different diseases, thanks to the heat, which why the sauna has been a very [[Hygiene|hygienic]] place. There is an old Finnish saying: ''"Jos sauna, terva ja viina ei auta, on tauti kuolemaksi."'' (in literally: "If sauna, [[tar]] and [[Liquor|booze]] doesn't help you, then a disease is deadly")<ref>[https://www.potilaanlaakarilehti.fi/uutiset/sauna-viina-ja-terva/ Sauna, viina ja terva – Potilaan Lääkärilehti] (in Finnish)</ref> The word is of Proto-Finnish origin (found in Finnic and Sámi languages) dating back 7,000 years.<ref>[http://finland.fi/Public/default.aspx?contentid=170017] Seeking the real Finnish Sauna&nbsp;– thisisFINLAND</ref> Steam baths have been part of European tradition elsewhere as well, but the sauna has survived best in Finland, in addition to Sweden, the [[Baltic states|Baltic States]], Russia, Norway, and parts of the United States and Canada. Moreover, nearly all Finnish houses have either their own sauna or in multistory apartment houses, a timeshare sauna. Public saunas were previously common, but the tradition has declined when saunas have been built nearly everywhere (private homes, municipal swimming halls, hotels, corporate headquarters, gyms, etc.). At one time, the [[World Sauna Championships]] were held in [[Heinola]], Finland, but the death of a Russian competitor in 2010 finally stopped organizing the competitions as too dangerous.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/08/sauna-championship-russian-dead Sauna contest leaves Russian dead and champion Finn in hospital] - ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

[[File:Mikael Agricola by Albert Edelfelt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Mikael Agricola]] (1510–1557), [[List of bishops of Turku|Bishop of Turku]], a prominent Lutheran Protestant reformer and the father of the Finnish written language]]
Written Finnish could be said to have existed since [[Mikael Agricola]] translated the [[New Testament]] into Finnish during the [[Protestant Reformation]], but few notable works of literature were written until the 19th century and the beginning of a Finnish national [[Romanticism|Romantic Movement]]. This prompted [[Elias Lönnrot]] to collect Finnish and Karelian folk poetry and arrange and publish them as the ''[[Kalevala]]'', the Finnish [[national epic]]. The era saw a rise of poets and novelists who wrote in Finnish, notably [[Aleksis Kivi]] (''[[The Seven Brothers]]''), [[Eino Leino]] (''Helkavirsiä''), [[Johannes Linnankoski]] (''[[The Song of the Blood-Red Flower]]'') and [[Juhani Aho]] (''[[The Railroad (novel)|The Railroad]]'' and ''[[Juha (novel)|Juha]]''). Many writers of the national awakening wrote in Swedish, such as the national poet [[J. L. Runeberg]] (''[[The Tales of Ensign Stål]]'') and [[Zachris Topelius]] (''[[The Tomten in Åbo Castle]]'').

After Finland became independent, there was a rise of [[Modernist literature|modernist writers]], most famously the Finnish-speaking [[Mika Waltari]] and Swedish-speaking [[Edith Södergran]]. [[Frans Eemil Sillanpää]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1939. World War II prompted a return to more national interests in comparison to a more international line of thought, characterized by [[Väinö Linna]] with his ''[[The Unknown Soldier (novel)|The Unknown Soldier]]'' and [[Under the North Star trilogy|''Under the North'' Star trilogy]]. Besides Lönnrot's ''Kalevala'' and Waltari, the Swedish-speaking [[Tove Jansson]], best known as the creator of ''[[The Moomins]]'', is the most translated Finnish writer;<ref>[https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finnish_post_honours_moomin_creator_jansson/7061316 Finnish post honours Moomin creator Jansson] - YLE News</ref> her books have been translated into more than 40 languages.<ref>[https://finland.fi/arts-culture/tove-jansson-and-the-moomin-story/ Finland’s Tove Jansson and the Moomin story]</ref> <!--Pure opinion?: Literature in modern Finland is in a healthy state.--> Popular modern writers include [[Arto Paasilinna]], [[Veikko Huovinen]], [[Antti Tuuri]], [[Ilkka Remes]], [[Kari Hotakainen]], [[Sofi Oksanen]], [[Tuomas Kyrö]], and [[Jari Tervo]], while the best novel is annually awarded the prestigious [[Finlandia Prize]].

The visual arts in Finland started to form their individual characteristics in the 19th century, when Romantic nationalism was rising in autonomic Finland. The best known of Finnish painters, [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]], started painting in a naturalist style, but moved to national romanticism. Other notable world-famous Finnish painters include [[Magnus Enckell]], [[Pekka Halonen]], [[Eero Järnefelt]], [[Helene Schjerfbeck]] and [[Hugo Simberg]]. Finland's best-known sculptor of the 20th century was [[Wäinö Aaltonen]], remembered for his monumental [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] and sculptures. Finns have made major contributions to [[handicraft]]s and [[industrial design]]: among the internationally renowned figures are [[Timo Sarpaneva]], [[Tapio Wirkkala]] and [[Ilmari Tapiovaara]]. Finnish architecture is famous around the world, and has contributed significantly to several styles internationally, such as [[Jugendstil]] (or [[Art Nouveau]]), [[Nordic Classicism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]]. Among the top 20th-century Finnish architects to gain international recognition are [[Eliel Saarinen]] and his son [[Eero Saarinen]]. Architect [[Alvar Aalto]] is regarded as among the most important 20th-century designers in the world;<ref>James Stevens Curl, ''Dictionary of Architecture'', Grange Books, Rochester, 2005, p. 1.</ref> he helped bring [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist architecture]] to Finland, but soon was a pioneer in its development towards an organic style.<ref>Sigfried Giedion, ''Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2nd edition, 1949.</ref> Aalto is also famous for his work in furniture, lamps, textiles and [[glassware]], which were usually incorporated into his buildings.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Finland|Rock music in Finland|Sami music}}
[[File:Jean Sibelius, 1913.jpg|thumb|upright|The Finnish composer [[Jean Sibelius]] (1865–1957) was a significant figure in the history of [[European classical music|classical music]].]]
;Classical
Much of Finland's classical music is influenced by traditional Karelian melodies and lyrics, as comprised in the ''[[Kalevala]]''. Karelian culture is perceived as the purest expression of the [[Baltic Finns|Finnic]] myths and beliefs, less influenced by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influence than the [[Nordic folk dance music]] that largely replaced the kalevaic tradition. Finnish [[folk music]] has undergone a [[roots revival]] in recent decades, and has become a part of [[popular music]].

The people of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, the [[Sami people|Sami]], are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called [[joik]]. The same word sometimes refers to [[lavlu]] or vuelie songs, though this is technically incorrect.

The first Finnish opera was written by the German-born composer [[Fredrik Pacius]] in 1852. Pacius also wrote the music to the poem [[Maamme|''Maamme/Vårt land'' (Our Country)]], Finland's [[national anthem]]. In the 1890s Finnish nationalism based on the ''Kalevala'' spread, and [[Jean Sibelius]] became famous for his vocal symphony ''[[Kullervo (Sibelius)|Kullervo]]''. He soon received a grant to study ''runo singers'' in Karelia and continued his rise as the first prominent Finnish musician. In 1899 he composed ''[[Finlandia]]'', which played its important role in Finland gaining independence. He remains one of Finland's most popular national figures and is a symbol of the nation. Another one of the most significant and internationally best-known Finnish-born classical composers long before Sibelius was [[Bernhard Crusell]].<ref>See [http://www.mozartforum.com/Contemporary%20Pages/Crusell_Contemp.htm biography of Crusell by Tel Asiado at Mozart Forum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708192751/http://www.mozartforum.com/Contemporary%20Pages/Crusell_Contemp.htm |date=8 July 2009 }} Accessed 31 January 2010.</ref>

Today, Finland has a very lively classical music scene and many of Finland's important [[List of Finnish composers|composers]] are still alive, such as [[Magnus Lindberg (Finnish composer)|Magnus Lindberg]], [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Kalevi Aho]], and [[Aulis Sallinen]]. The composers are accompanied by a large number of great conductors such as [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], [[Osmo Vänskä]], [[Jukka-Pekka Saraste]], and [[Leif Segerstam]]. Some of the internationally acclaimed Finnish classical musicians are [[Karita Mattila]], [[Soile Isokoski]], [[Pekka Kuusisto]], [[Olli Mustonen]], and [[Linda Brava|Linda Lampenius]].

During the early 1960s, the first significant wave of Finnish rock groups emerged, playing [[instrumental rock]] inspired by groups such as [[The Shadows]]. Around 1964, [[Beatlemania]] arrived in Finland, resulting in further development of the local rock scene. During the late 1960s and '70s, Finnish rock musicians increasingly wrote their own music instead of translating international hits into Finnish. During the decade, some [[progressive rock]] groups such as [[Tasavallan Presidentti]] and [[Wigwam (Finnish band)|Wigwam]] gained respect abroad but failed to make a commercial breakthrough outside Finland. This was also the fate of the [[rock and roll]] group [[Hurriganes]]. The Finnish punk scene produced some internationally acknowledged names including [[Terveet Kädet]] in the 1980s. [[Hanoi Rocks]] was a pioneering 1980s [[glam rock]] act that inspired the American [[hard rock]] group [[Guns N' Roses]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304587704577333813382925678|title=Guns N' Roses Can Agree on at Least One Thing: This Finnish Saxophonist Rocks |last=Shah|first=Neil|date=15 April 2012|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=19 November 2012}}</ref>

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Finnish cuisine}}
[[File:Karjalanpiirakka-20060227.jpg|thumb|[[Karjalanpiirakat|Karelian pasty]] (''karjalanpiirakka'') is a traditional Finnish dish made from a thin rye crust with a filling of rice. Butter, often mixed with boiled egg (eggbutter or munavoi), is spread over the hot pastries before eating.]]

Finnish cuisine is notable for generally combining traditional country fare and ''[[haute cuisine]]'' with contemporary style cooking. [[Fish (food)|Fish]] and meat play a prominent role in traditional Finnish dishes from the western part of the country, while the dishes from the eastern part have traditionally included various vegetables and [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]]. Refugees from Karelia contributed to foods in eastern Finland.

Finnish foods often use [[wholemeal]] products ([[rye]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s) and berries (such as [[bilberry|bilberries]], [[lingonberry|lingonberries]], [[cloudberry|cloudberries]], and [[sea buckthorn]]). Milk and its derivatives like [[buttermilk]] are commonly used as food, drink, or in various recipes. Various [[turnip]]s were common in traditional cooking, but were replaced with the potato after its introduction in the 18th century.

According to the statistics, red meat consumption has risen, but still Finns eat less beef than many other nations, and more fish and poultry. This is mainly because of the high cost of meat in Finland.

Finland has the world's highest per capita consumption of [[coffee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fusiontables.google.com/DataSource?docid=1C-fn6nSe21acP0xJIO1T1x0wohqfMYCQyJjbqdk#rows:id=1|title=Google Fusion Tables|website=fusiontables.google.com}}</ref> Milk consumption is also high, at an average of about {{convert|112|litre}}, per person, per year,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.luke.fi/en/news/what-was-eaten-in-finland-in-2017|title=What was eaten in Finland in 2017|website=Luonnonvarakeskus}}</ref> even though 17% of the Finns are [[lactose intolerant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edunation.co/studyinfinland/blog/5-odd-facts-finland/|title=Odd Facts about Finland|website=edunation.co|date=19 September 2017}}</ref>

Of these, Christmas and Midsummer are special in Finland because the actual festivities take place on eves, such as [[Christmas Eve]] (''jouluaatto'')<ref>''Llewellyn's Sabbats Almanac: Samhain 2010 to Mabon 2011'' p.64.

In terms of medals and gold medals won per capita, Finland is the best performing country in Olympic history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medalspercapita.com/#medals-per-capita:all-time|title=Olympic Medals per Capita|website=medalspercapita.com}}</ref> Finland first participated as a nation in its own right at the [[Olympic Games]] in 1908, while still an autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]] within the [[Russian Empire]]. At the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], great pride was taken in the three gold medals won by the original "[[Flying Finn]]" [[Hannes Kolehmainen]].

Finland was one of the most successful countries at the Olympic Games before [[World War II]]. At the [[1924 Summer Olympics]], Finland, a nation then of only 3.2 million people, came second in the medal count. In the 1920s and '30s, Finnish long-distance runners dominated the Olympics, with [[Paavo Nurmi]] winning a total of nine Olympic gold medals between 1920 and 1928 and setting 22 official world records between 1921 and 1931. Nurmi is often considered the greatest Finnish sportsman and one of the greatest athletes of all time.

For over 100 years, Finnish male and female athletes have consistently excelled at the [[javelin throw]]. The event has brought Finland nine Olympic gold medals, five world championships, five European championships, and 24 world records.

In addition to Kolehmainen and Nurmi, some of Finland's most internationally well-known and successful sportspeople are long-distance runners [[Ville Ritola]] and [[Lasse Virén]]; ski-jumpers [[Matti Nykänen]] and [[Janne Ahonen]]; cross-country skiers [[Veikko Hakulinen]], [[Eero Mäntyranta]], [[Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi]] and [[Mika Myllylä]]; rower [[Pertti Karppinen]]; gymnast [[Heikki Savolainen (gymnast)|Heikki Savolainen]]; professional skateboarder [[Arto Saari]]; ice hockey players [[Kimmo Timonen]], [[Jari Kurri]], [[Teemu Selänne]], and [[Saku Koivu]]; football players [[Jari Litmanen]] and [[Sami Hyypiä]]; basketball player [[Hanno Möttölä]]; alpine skiers [[Kalle Palander]] and [[Tanja Poutiainen]]; Formula One world champions [[Keke Rosberg]], [[Mika Häkkinen]] and [[Kimi Räikkönen]]; four-time World Rally champions [[Juha Kankkunen]] and [[Tommi Mäkinen]]; and 13-time World [[Enduro]] Champion [[Juha Salminen]], seven-time champion [[Kari Tiainen]], and the five-time champions [[Mika Ahola]], biathlete [[Kaisa Mäkäräinen]] and [[Samuli Aro]]. Finland is also one of the most successful nations in [[bandy]], being the only nation beside Russia and Sweden to win a [[Bandy World Championship]].

The [[1952 Summer Olympics]] were held in Helsinki. Other notable sporting events held in Finland include the [[1983 World Championships in Athletics|1983]] and [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]].

Finland also has a notable history in [[figure skating]]. Finnish skaters have won 8 world championships and 13 junior world cups in synchronized skating, and Finland is considered one of the best countries at the sport.

Some of the most popular recreational sports and activities include [[floorball]], [[Nordic walking]], running, cycling, and skiing ([[alpine skiing]], [[cross-country skiing]], and [[ski jumping]]).
Floorball, in terms of registered players, occupies third place after football and ice hockey. According to the Finnish Floorball Federation, floorball is the most popular school, youth, club and workplace sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expat-finland.com/events/finnish_sports.html|title=Finnish Sports: Try the sports Finns love!|first=Stuart Allt Web Design, Turku|last=Finland|website=expat-finland.com}}</ref> {{as of|2016}}, the total number of licensed players reaches 57,400.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floorball.org/pages/EN/Finland|title=IFF|last=IFF|website=floorball.org}}</ref>
