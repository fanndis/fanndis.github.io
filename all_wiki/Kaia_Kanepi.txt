Kanepi reached her first final in 2006, becoming the first Estonian player to do so, at the [[Gaz de France Stars]] where she lost to [[Kim Clijsters]]. She then won her first singles title in [[Internazionali Femminili di Palermo|Palermo]] in 2010, also becoming the first Estonian player to win a title. She has also reached six Grand Slam quarterfinals in three different championships (French Open in 2008 and 2012, Wimbledon in 2010 and 2013, and the US Open in 2010 and 2017), becoming the first Estonian to achieve this and was the first Estonian to be ranked inside the world's top 20. Kanepi's numerous achievements have made her Estonia's most famous and successful professional tennis player in history.

==Career==
Kaia Kanepi was born in [[Haapsalu]]. Her father, Jaak (a [[real estate broker]]) and mother Anne (a [[homemaker]]) played tennis. They also have daughters Kadri, who won a tennis scholarship to study in the United States, and Karin, a dedicated horse rider. Kaia, who always watched her parents and sisters play, discovered her love for tennis at an early age. She started playing at the age of eight.

Her family has always supported her desire to play professional tennis. She reached world number one in the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) junior rankings before turning professional in 2000.

1994–2003 Kaia was trained by Tiit Kivistik. From 2003 until the autumn of 2007, Kaia was coached by [[Andrei Luzgin]]. After Luzgin, [[Fredrik Lovén]] from Sweden became her coach, but their partnership ended in February 2008. Kanepi's next coach (until September 2008) was Pablo Giacopelli. From November 2008, she was coached by Luca Appino. After November 2009, Kanepi was coached by fellow Estonia pro [[Mait Künnap]]. In February 2010, she broke up with her coach and agent. In April, she started to work with Silver Karjus, who was her coach until March 2012. From 2013–2014, she was coached by Märten Tamla.

===2004–2007===
Kanepi represented [[Estonia at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Estonia]] in both the women's singles and women's doubles, partnering [[Maret Ani]], at the [[Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]], losing in the first round of both events.

At the end of 2006, she reached her first [[WTA Tour]] final during the [[Gaz de France Stars]] tournament in Hasselt, Belgium. She came through three qualification rounds and beat [[Anne Kremer]], [[Nathalie Dechy]], [[Eleni Daniilidou]], [[Francesca Schiavone]], and [[Michaëlla Krajicek]] to eventually play the final against [[Kim Clijsters]], to whom she lost in three sets.

At the [[2007 Australian Open – Women's Singles|2007 Australian Open]], Kanepi struggled, but defeated 28th-seeded [[Flavia Pennetta]] before losing to [[Alicia Molik]] in the second round. At Indian Wells, she defeated wildcard [[Kristina Brandi]] in the first round, but lost in the second round to 14th seed and eventual champion, [[Daniela Hantuchová]]. At the Sony Ericsson Open in Key Biscayne, Florida, she stunned [[Patty Schnyder]] in the second round, before losing to qualifier [[Vera Dushevina]] in the next round.

In late July, Kanepi reached the semifinals of the [[WTA Austrian Open|Bad Gastein]] tournament in Austria, where she fell to Francesca Schiavone. This was her third career semifinal and first of the year. Afterwards, she made her top-40 debut at world No. 40.

===2008: French Open quarterfinal===
After losing in the first round of [[2008 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]], Kanepi performed better in the next Grand Slam. At the [[2008 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]], Kanepi defeated sixth seed [[Anna Chakvetadze]] in the second round. She then defeated 29th-seeded [[Anabel Medina Garrigues]] for a place in the fourth round. Outplaying unseeded [[Petra Kvitová]] she reached the quarterfinals, where she was defeated by fourth seed [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] in straight sets. Nonetheless, Kanepi made history by becoming the first Estonian tennis player to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal.

She set a new personal {{convert|196|km/h}} serve record in the tournament, among the fastest ever served by a woman.

She continued her season at the [[2009 Open GDF Suez|Open GdF Suez]], a Premier tournament, but lost in the second round to [[Émilie Loit]].

At the top-level Dubai Championships, she advanced to the third round to set up a match with former world number one, [[Jelena Janković]] whom she defeated in straight sets. She was the highest-seeded player Kanepi had by that time defeated. Kanepi then beat [[Elena Vesnina]] in the quarterfinals, in straight sets. She was, however, denied a place in the finals by Virginie Razzano.

Kanepi then participated at the [[Rome Masters]]. She defeated Patty Schnyder in the third round, but lost to [[Victoria Azarenka]] in the quarterfinals. Her next tournament was the [[2009 Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open|Madrid Open]], where she was seeded 16th. However, she retired in the first round against Lucie Šafářová. In the [[2009 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]] opening round, Kanepi was defeated by Yaroslava Shvedova in the first surprise of the day. Her first round loss led to a drop in her ranking, as she fell to world No. 24.

She was then scheduled to play at the [[2009 Aegon Classic|Aegon Classic]] in Birmingham as the second seed. However, she then withdrew because of a knee injury. Kanepi was seeded 25th at the [[2009 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon Championships]], but lost to [[Carla Suárez Navarro]] in the first round.

Kanepi lost her opening matches at [[2009 Swedish Open|Bastad]] and [[2009 Banka Koper Slovenia Open|Portoroz]]. Her bad form continued when she lost three straight first-round matches during the [[US Open Series]].

Kanepi lost to Chang again in the first round at [[2009 Toray Pan Pacific Open|Tokyo]].

She then lost to [[Regina Kulikova]].

===2010: Wimbledon and US Open quarterfinals===
By the start of the new season, Kanepi seemed to be in better physical shape than in 2009. Kanepi reached the second round at the [[WTA Auckland Open|ASB Classic]], defeating world No. 15, Li Na, in straight sets, before losing to [[Maria Kirilenko]] in the second round.

Despite this, Kanepi's ranking fell to world No. 96, due to the fact that she did not defend her points from Dubai from the previous year.

Kanepi reached the second round in [[2010 Abierto Mexicano Telcel|Acapulco]], but lost to top seed and defending champion [[Venus Williams]]. Kanepi also fell in the second round of the [[2010 Monterrey Open|Monterrey Open]] to second seed Daniela Hantuchová in straight sets.

==Playing style==
Kanepi builds up her game around her powerful [[groundstroke]]s. Her serve is considered to be one of the strongest on the WTA Tour. Kanepi frequently hits 170&nbsp;km/h to 180&nbsp;km/h serves. She generally serves away from her opponent but sometimes prefers to hit a powerful body first serve in order to push back and pin her opponent behind the baseline. But on occasions her serve can break down, which affects her game. In 2008, she began to improve her volleying skills and under her coach Luca Appino begun to use sliced backhand more often, thus making her playing more versatile.{{cn|date=May 2020}}

She likes to return serves mainly with her backhand which she hits flat and tries to position herself to receive with backhand but is also capable of hitting good service returns with her forehand as well. She generally ends points early but she is capable of playing long rallies and reducing her unforced error count. Overall, she is an [[offensive baseliner]] but depending on the game situation and scoreboard Kanepi can play a more defensive game.

==Sponsorship==
For a long time Kanepi was sponsored by Infortar, the largest shareholder of [[Tallink]], a major [[ferry]] company in the [[Baltic Sea]]. Their sponsorship ended in February 2010,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sport.postimees.ee/219097/treener-ning-sponsorid-loobusid-koostoost-kaia-kanepiga|title=Treener ning sponsorid loobusid koostööst Kaia Kanepiga|work=[[Postimees]]|date=1 February 2010|accessdate=13 June 2018|language=Estonian}}</ref> but later started again<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sport.postimees.ee/345968/pant-meil-pole-kanepiga-mingit-tuli-olnud|title=Pant: meil pole Kanepiga mingit tüli olnud |work=[[Postimees]]|date=23 November 2010|accessdate=13 June 2018|language=Estonian}}</ref> and finally ended in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://uudised.tv3.ee/sport/uudis/2017/04/05/kaia-kanepi-otsib-raha-ja-treenerit |title=Kaia Kanepi otsib raha ja treenerit |date=2017-04-05 |website=uudised.tv3.ee |language=et |access-date=2018-08-27}}</ref>
