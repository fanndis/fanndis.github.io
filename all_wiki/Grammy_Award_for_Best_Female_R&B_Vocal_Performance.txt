The '''Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance''' (previously called '''Best Rhythm and Blues Solo Vocal Performance, Female''') was an honor presented at the [[Grammy Awards]], a ceremony established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards,<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> to female recording artists for quality [[R&B]] songs. Awards in several categories are distributed annually  by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency  and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position."<ref name=Overview>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy|title=Overview|accessdate=2011-10-18|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref>

According to the category description guide for the [[52nd Grammy Awards]], the award was presented to artists that performed "newly recorded solo R&B vocal performances". Solo numbers by members of an established group were not eligible for the award as "separate entries from the duo or group performances."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/PDFs/Recording_Academy/52guide.pdf |title=52nd OEP Category Description Guide |accessdate=2011-10-18 |page=3 |format=PDF |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027172820/http://www.grammy.com/PDFs/Recording_Academy/52guide.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-27 }}</ref> Albums were also considered for the accolade until 1992.

As a part of the major overhaul of Grammy categories, the award was discontinued in 2011. The Female R&B Vocal Performance category, Male R&B Vocal Performance category and all duo/group vocal performances in the R&B category shifted to the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance|Best R&B Performance]] category in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/files/pages/category_final.pdf|title=Awards Category Comparison Chart|accessdate=2011-10-18|page=1|format=PDF|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences}}</ref>

The award for the Best Female R&B Vocal Performance was first presented to [[Aretha Franklin]] at the [[10th Grammy Awards]] ceremony in 1968 for the song "[[Respect (song)|Respect]]". Franklin received the most wins with eleven, followed by [[Anita Baker]] with five. Franklin also holds the record for the most nominations with twenty-three, while [[Chaka Khan]] is second with eight nominations. [[Fantasia Barrino]] became the final recipient of the award, when her song "[[Bittersweet (Fantasia song)|Bittersweet]]" won the award in 2011. The award was presented to artists from the United States each year.
