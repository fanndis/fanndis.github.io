Portrayed by [[Jennifer Aniston]], the character was created by [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]] and [[Marta Kauffman]], and appeared in all of the show's [[List of Friends episodes|236 episodes]] during its decade-long run, from its [[Pilot (Friends)|premiere]] on September 22, 1994 to its [[The Last One (Friends)|finale]] on May 6, 2004. Introduced in the show's [[Pilot (Friends)|pilot]] as a naïve runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend [[Monica Geller]] and relocates to New York City, Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled, inexperienced "daddy's girl" into a successful businesswoman. During the show's [[Friends (season 2)|second season]], the character becomes romantically involved with Monica's brother, [[Ross Geller|Ross]], with whom she maintains a complicated [[on-again, off-again relationship|on-off relationship]] throughout the series. Together, Ross and Rachel have a daughter, [[Emma Geller-Green|Emma]].

The role of Rachel was originally offered to  [[Téa Leoni]], the producer's first choice, and [[Courteney Cox]], both of whom declined, Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom ''[[The Naked Truth (TV series)|The Naked Truth]]'', and Cox in favor of playing Rachel's best friend Monica in ''Friends''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Oral History of Friends: Jennifer Aniston Almost Didn't Play Rachel Green |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/04/friends-oral-history-jennifer-aniston-rachel-green |website=[[Vanity (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |access-date=11 February 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525080635/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/04/friends-oral-history-jennifer-aniston-rachel-green |archive-date=May 25, 2014 }}</ref> A virtually unknown actress at the time, who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms, Aniston auditioned for the role of Rachel after turning down an offer as a [[List of Saturday Night Live cast members|cast member]] on the [[sketch comedy show]] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. After acquiring the role and before ''Friends'' aired, Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom, ''[[Muddling Through]]'', at the time, which was ultimately cancelled and allowed Aniston to remain on ''Friends''.

Critical reception towards Rachel has remained consistently positive throughout ''Friends''{{'}} decade-long run, with ''[[The A.V. Club]] ''attributing much of the show's early success to the character. However, some of her storylines have been criticized, specifically her romantic relationship with her friend [[Joey Tribbiani]] during [[Friends (season 10)|season 10]]. Rachel's popularity established her as the show's [[breakout character]], who has since been named one of the greatest television characters of all time, while the character's second season haircut spawned an international phenomenon of its own. Named the "Rachel" after her, the character's [[Shag (hairstyle)|shag]] continues to be imitated by millions of women around the world and remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history, in spite of Aniston personally disliking it. Rachel is also regarded as a style icon due to her influence on womenswear during the 1990s. Meanwhile, the character's relationship with Ross is often cited among television's most beloved.

Rachel is considered to be Aniston's [[Breakthrough role|breakout role]], credited with making her the show's most famous cast member and for spawning her successful film career. Praised for her performance as Rachel, Aniston won both an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress&nbsp;– Television Series Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series&nbsp;– Comedy Or Musical]].

== Role ==
Rachel debuts in the [[Pilot (Friends)|pilot episode]] of ''Friends'' as a runaway bride who is distraught after abandoning her fiancé [[List of Friends characters#Barry Farber|Barry Farber]] ([[Mitchell Whitfield]]) at the [[altar]]. She locates her high school best friend [[Monica Geller]] ([[Courteney Cox]]), the only person she knows in New York City, who agrees to let Rachel reside with her while she attempts to reorganize her life. Rachel meets and befriends Monica's friends [[Phoebe Buffay]] ([[Lisa Kudrow]]), [[Joey Tribbiani]] ([[Matt LeBlanc]]), and [[Chandler Bing]] ([[Matthew Perry]]), while reuniting with Monica's older brother [[Ross Geller]] ([[David Schwimmer]]), who has harbored unrequited romantic feelings for her since high school. Having previously relied on her parents' money her entire life with a sole goal of [[Trophy wife|marrying wealthy]], Rachel attempts to reinvent herself as an independent young woman by [[waitress]]ing at [[Central Perk]], a [[coffeehouse]] where her new friends regularly socialize.<ref>{{Cite episode|airdate=September 22, 1994|credits=[[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]] & [[Marta Kauffman]] (writers); [[James Burrows]] (director)|episode-link = The Pilot (Friends)|network=NBC|number=1|season=1|series=Friends|title=Pilot|series-link=Friends}}</ref> She is terrible at the job, but remains employed because the manager, [[Gunther (Friends)|Gunther]] ([[James Michael Tyler]]), is in love with her.

As season one concludes, Rachel finds out that Ross is in love with her, and realizes that she loves him, too. When she goes to tell him, however, she finds that he has begun a relationship with a woman named [[Julie (Friends)|Julie]] ([[Lauren Tom]]).<ref>{{Cite episode|airdate=May 18, 1995|credits=Chris Brown (writer); [[Kevin S.

He tells Rachel he's done so but confesses to Phoebe that they're still married.

After signing the papers, they admit that if they ever got married properly,  it would be the one that lasted.

After an argument following Rachel kissing her colleague Gavin ([[Dermot Mulroney]]) and giving her phone number to a man she met at a bar, Rachel moves back in with Joey. 

At the end of season nine, Joey confesses that he still has feelings for Rachel, and they decide to try dating.<ref>{{Cite episode|airdate=May 11, 2003|credits=Marta Kaufman & David Crane (writers); Kevin Bright (director)|network = NBC|number=9|season=24|series=Friends|title=The One in Barbados: Part 2}}</ref> They break up in [[Friends (season 10)|season ten]], however, both because their romance upsets Ross and because they realize that they don't work as a couple.<ref>{{Cite episode|airdate=October 9, 2003|credits=Brian Buckner (writer); Gary Halvorson (director)|network = NBC|number=10|season=3|series=Friends|series-link=Friends (TV series)|title=The One with Ross's Tan}}</ref>

In the first episode of the spin-off/sequel ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'', it appears that Ross and Rachel were remarried shortly after the events of season 10 as Joey tells his sister Gina ([[Drea de Matteo]]) that all of his friends have got married. In the episode "Joey and the Breakup", while discussing his relationship with Sarah ([[Mädchen Amick]]), Joey mentions Rachel, though not by name, to Gina as the only woman he ever confessed his love to, which led to brief heartbreak when Rachel did not reciprocate his feelings (as Joey puts it, "We were living together, she was pregnant with my best friend's baby and she ended up with him.").

After Ross and Rachel's break up, there were many hints that they would eventually reunite forever, especially seasons 8-10. In the final season, Rachel wants to sleep with Ross when her father has a heart attack and wants "sympathy sex", which he turns down, not wanting to take advantage of her in the state she is in. However, Ross and Rachel do sleep together again the night before she leaves for Paris, which results in him admitting he still loves her and wants to get back together in [[The Last One (Friends)|the series finale]]. Rachel turns down the Paris job in order to be with Ross when she realizes she still loves him too, and the two agree "this is it", getting back together for good. [[Jennifer Aniston]], who played Rachel, confirmed that after the series finale, Ross and Rachel got remarried, happily and had at least one more child.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jennifer-aniston-friends-ross-rachel-wanderlust-walk-of-fame-294015 |title=Jennifer Aniston talks about Ross and Rachel |date=February 22, 2012 |access-date=December 18, 2016 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221101722/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jennifer-aniston-friends-ross-rachel-wanderlust-walk-of-fame-294015 |archive-date=December 21, 2016 }}</ref>
