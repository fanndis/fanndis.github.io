'''Claudia Alta''' "'''Lady Bird'''" '''Johnson''' ([[Maiden and married names|née]] '''Taylor'''; December 22, 1912 – July 11, 2007) was an American socialite and  the [[First Lady of the United States]] as the wife of the 36th [[President of the United States]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] from 1963 to 1969. She also served as the [[Second Lady of the United States]] from 1961 to 1963. 

Notably well-educated for a woman of her era, she proved a capable manager and a successful [[Investor|investor]]. After marrying Lyndon B. Johnson in 1934 when he was a political hopeful in [[Austin, Texas]], she used a modest inheritance to bankroll his congressional campaign and then ran his office while he served in the Navy.

As First Lady, she broke new ground by interacting directly with Congress, employing her own press secretary, and making a solo electioneering tour. Johnson was an advocate for beautifying the nation's cities and highways ("Where flowers bloom, so does hope"). The [[Highway Beautification Act]] was informally known as "Lady Bird's Bill." She received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1977, and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1988, the highest honors bestowed upon a US civilian.

Opinions differ about whether the name refers to a bird or a [[Coccinellidae|ladybird beetle]], the latter of which is commonly referred to as a "ladybug" in North America.<ref name="washpostchamp"/> The nickname virtually replaced her first name for the rest of her life.

and her husband called her Bird—the name she used on her marriage license. During her teenage years, some classmates would call her Bird to provoke her, since she reportedly was not fond of the name.<ref name="Time_one" >{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,876083-4,00.html |title=The White House: The First Lady Bird |date=August 28, 1964 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=26 December 2015|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125002910/http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,876083-4,00.html |archive-date=January 25, 2016}}</ref>

Nearly all of her maternal and paternal immigrant ancestors arrived in the [[Virginia Colony]] during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, likely as indentured servants as were most early settlers in the colony. Her father, a native of [[Alabama]], had primarily [[English people|English]] ancestry, and some [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and [[Danish people|Danish]]. Her mother, also a native of Alabama, was of English and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Her father, Thomas Jefferson Taylor (August 29, 1874 – October 22, 1960), was a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper's]] son. He became a wealthy businessman, and owned {{convert|15000|acre|ha|0}} of cotton and two general stores. "My father was a very strong character, to put it mildly," his daughter once said. "He lived by his own rules. It was a whole feudal way of life, really."<ref name="pbsearly" />

Her mother, born Minnie Lee Pattillo (1874–1918), loved opera and felt out of place in Karnack; she was often in "poor emotional and physical health."<ref name=pbp /> When Lady Bird was five years old, Minnie fell down a flight of stairs while pregnant and died of complications of [[miscarriage]].<ref name=pbp /> In a profile of Lady Bird Johnson, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] described Lady Bird's mother as "a tall, eccentric woman from an old and aristocratic Alabama family, [who] liked to wear long white dresses and heavy veils [... and who] scandalized people for miles around by entertaining Negroes in her home, and once even started to write a book about Negro religious practices, called Bio Baptism."<ref name="Time_two" >{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,876083-3,00.html |title=The White House: The First Lady Bird |date=August 28, 1964 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=26 December 2015|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124200048/http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,876083-3,00.html |archive-date=January 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>The Time magazine article mistakenly uses "Bio" instead of "Bayou" in this title</ref> Her husband, however, tended to see blacks as nothing more than "hewers of wood and drawers of water," according to his younger son Anthony.<ref name="Time_two" />

Lady Bird had two elder brothers, Thomas Jefferson Jr. (1901–1959) and Antonio, also known as Tony (1904–1986). Her widowed father married twice more. His second wife was Beulah Taylor, a bookkeeper at a general store.<ref>1930 United States Federal Census</ref> His third wife was Ruth Scroggins, whom he married in 1937.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=fta26|name=Taylor, Thomas Jefferson II|author=Mark Odintz|retrieved=December 24, 2008}}</ref>

Lady Bird was largely raised by her maternal aunt Effie Pattillo, who moved to Karnack after her sister's death. She also visited her Pattillo relatives in [[Autauga County, Alabama]], every summer until she was a young woman. As she explained, "Until I was about 20, summertime always meant Alabama to me. With Aunt Effie we would board the train in Marshall and ride to the part of the world that meant watermelon cuttings, picnics at the creek, and a lot of company every Sunday."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939432,00.html "So Glad, So Glad"]. ''Time''. April 3, 1964.</ref> According to Lady Bird, her Aunt Effie "opened my spirit to beauty, but she neglected to give me any insight into the practical matters a girl should know about, such as how to dress or choose one's friends or learning to dance."<ref name="Time_one" />

Lady Bird was a shy and quiet girl who spent much of her youth alone outdoors. "People always look back at it now and assume it was lonely," she once said about her childhood. "To me it definitely was not. ... I spent a lot of time just walking and fishing and swimming."<ref name="TalkWith">{{cite news|first=Henry|last=B.|title=''A Talk With the First Lady''|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 10, 1967}}</ref> She developed her lifelong love of the outdoors as a child growing up in the tall [[pine]]s and [[bayou]]s of [[East Texas]], where she watched the [[wildflower]]s bloom each spring.<ref>Wilson, Janet.

==Education==
[[File:Bluebonnets College Station Texas.jpg|thumb|A field of bluebonnets in Texas]]
When it came time to enter high school,<ref name="TalkWith"/> Lady Bird had to move away and live with another family during weekdays in the town of [[Jefferson, Texas]],<ref name="ausstatesman"/> since there was no high school in the Karnack area. (Her brothers were sent to boarding schools in New York). She graduated third in her class at the age of 15 from [[Marshall High School (Marshall, Texas)|Marshall Senior High School]] in the nearby county seat. Despite her young age, her father gave her a car so that she could drive herself to school, a distance of {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} each way. She said of that time, "[I]t was an awful chore for my daddy to delegate some person from his business to take me in and out."<ref name="TalkWith"/> During her senior year, when she realized that she had the highest grades in her class, she "purposely allowed her grades to slip" so that she would not have to give the [[valedictorian]] or [[salutatorian]] speech.<ref name="washpostchamp"/>

After graduating from high school in May 1928, Lady Bird entered the [[University of Alabama]] for the summer session, where she took her first [[journalism]] course. But, homesick for Texas, she stayed at home and did not return for the fall term at Alabama.<ref>Russell, Jan Jarboe, ''Lady Bird, A Biography of Mrs. Johnson'', 1999, New York: Scribner, pp. 69-70</ref> Instead, she and a high school friend enrolled at St. Mary's Episcopal College for Women,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kbs46|title=ST.

It influenced her to "convert to the Episcopal faith," although she waited five years to be confirmed.<ref>Russell (1999), pp. 70-71</ref>

After graduating from St. Mary's in May 1930, Lady Bird toyed with the idea of going back to Alabama. Another friend from Marshall was going to the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], so she chartered a plane to Austin to join her. As the plane landed, she was awed by the sight of a field covered with [[Lupinus texensis|bluebonnets]] and instantly fell in love with the city.<ref>Russell (1999), pp. 71-72</ref> Lady Bird received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history<ref>University of Texas, Austin, Yearbook 1933</ref> with honors in 1933<ref>Russell (1999), p. 83</ref> and a second bachelor's degree in journalism ''cum laude'' in 1934.<ref>Russell (1999), p. 88</ref> She was active on campus in different organizations, including Texas [[Orange Jackets]], a women's honorary service organization, and believed in student leadership. Her goal was to become a reporter, but she also earned a teaching certificate.<ref name="washpostchamp"/>

The summer after her second graduation, she and a girlfriend traveled to [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], where they peered through the fence at the [[White House]].<ref name="washpostchamp" /> Dallek described Lady Bird as having undergone a boost in her self-confidence through her years at the college. Her time marked a departure from her timid behavior in her youth.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lyndon B. Johnson: Portrait of a President|page=24|first=Robert|last=Dallek|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195159219}}</ref>

==Marriage and family==
A friend in Austin introduced her to [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Baines Johnson]], a 26-year-old  Congressional aide with political aspirations,<ref name="axcess">{{cite web|url=http://axcessnews.com/national/breaking-national/lady-bird-johnson-first-lady-nation-mourns_1620/|title=Lady Bird Johnson, the First Lady a Nation Mourns|last=Duke|first=Armando|date=July 12, 2007|work=[[Axcess News]]|accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref> working for Congressman [[Richard Kleberg]].<ref name="washpostchamp"/> Lady Bird recalled having felt "like a moth drawn to a flame".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2001-12-11/lifestyle/0112100301_1_lady-bird-johnson-lyndon-baines-johnson-first-lady| title=Lady Bird Johnson Was LBJ's Anchor In Troubled Times| accessdate=2013-09-11| work=Sun Sentinel| first=Patricia| last=Brennan| date=December 11, 2001}}</ref> Biographer Randall B.

On their first date, at the [[Driskill Hotel]],<ref name="pbsearly" /> Lyndon proposed. Lady Bird did not want to rush into marriage, but he was persistent and did not want to wait. Ten weeks later, Lady Bird accepted his proposal.<ref name="washpostchamp"/> The couple married on November 17, 1934, at [[St. Mark's Episcopal Church (San Antonio, Texas)|St. Mark's Episcopal Church]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]].

After she suffered three miscarriages,<ref name="washpostchamp"/> the couple had two daughters together: [[Lynda Bird Johnson Robb|Lynda Bird]] (born in 1944) and [[Luci Baines Johnson|Luci Baines]] (born in 1947).<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/washington/12johnson.html?pagewanted=3&ei=5088&en=1a0d3326e18d71e7&ex=1341892800&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss ''New York Times'' "Lady Bird Johnson, 94, Dies; Eased a Path to Power"] July 12, 2007</ref> The couple and their two daughters all shared the initials LBJ. Their daughters lived in the White House during their teenage years, under close scrutiny of the media.

Both daughters held White House weddings. Lynda Bird married [[Charles S. Robb]], who was later elected as governor of [[Virginia]] and U.S. Senator. Luci Baines married Pat Nugent and, later, Ian Turpin. Lady Bird had seven grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren at the time of her death.<ref name="washpostchamp"/>

==Early politics==
When Lyndon decided to run for Congress from Austin's 10th district, Lady Bird provided the money to launch his campaign. She took $10,000 of her inheritance from her mother's estate to help start his political career.<ref>Wilson, Janet. "Wife, mother, partner," ''The Austin American-Statesman'', July 13, 2007, p.3 (Lady Bird Johnson Commemorative Section)</ref> The couple settled in Washington, D.C., after Lyndon was elected to Congress.<ref name="chron94">{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Claudia|title=Green first lady planted a movement; Former first lady Lady Bird Johnson dies at 94|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=July 11, 2007|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4960783.html|accessdate=March 16, 2014}}</ref> After he enlisted in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] at the outset of [[World War II|the Second World War]], Lady Bird ran his congressional office.<ref name="chron94"/>

Lady Bird sometimes served as a mediating force between her willful husband and those he encountered. On one occasion after Lyndon had clashed with [[Dan Rather]], then a young [[Houston, Texas]], reporter, Lady Bird followed Rather in her car. Stopping him, she invited him to return and have some punch, explaining, "That's just the way Lyndon sometimes is."<ref name="npr94">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11664985 ''NPR'' "Former First Lady 'Lady Bird' Johnson Dead at 94"] July 12, 2007</ref>

During the years of the Johnson presidency, Lyndon in one incident yelled at the White House photographer who failed to show up for a photoshoot with the First Lady. She consoled the photographer afterward, who said that, in spite of his feelings against President Johnson, he "would walk over hot coals for Lady Bird."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://keranews.org/post/how-lady-bird-shaped-lbjs-presidency|title=How Lady Bird Shaped LBJ's Presidency|date=November 30, 2015|first=Hady Karl|last=Mawajdeh|publisher=KERA News}}</ref>

==Business career==
In January–February 1943, during World War II, Lady Bird Johnson spent $17,500 of her inheritance to purchase [[KLBJ (AM)|KTBC]], an Austin radio station.<ref name="dallas news"/> She bought the radio station from a three-man partnership that included [[Robert B. Anderson]], a future [[United States Secretary of the Navy|U.S. Secretary of the Navy]] and [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]], and Texas oilman and rancher [[Wesley West]].

She served as president of the LBJ Holding Co., and her husband negotiated an agreement with the [[CBS]] radio network. Lady Bird decided to expand by buying a [[television]] station in 1952, despite Lyndon's objections. She reminded him that she could do as she wished with her inheritance.<ref name="washpostchamp"/>  The station, [[KTBC (TV)|KTBC]]-TV/7 (then affiliated with CBS as well), was Austin's [[monopoly]] [[VHF]] franchise and generated revenues that made the Johnsons millionaires.<ref name="dailytelegraph">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/news/2007/07/13/db1302.xml|title=Lady Bird Johnson |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London | date=July 13, 2007 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> Over the years, journalists have revealed that Lyndon used his influence in the Senate to influence the [[Federal Communications Commission]] into granting the monopoly license, which was in Lady Bird's name.<ref name="'70s">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/27 27]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/27|url-access= registration}}</ref><ref name="new yorker">{{cite news |title= The Johnson Years: Buying and Selling|last= Caro|first= Robert A.|date=December 18, 1989|publisher= The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1989/12/18/1989_12_18_043_TNY_CARDS_000356927 }}</ref><ref name=Fire>{{cite book | last1=O'Donnell |first1=Lawrence |date=2017 |title=Playing with Fire – The 1968 Elections and the Transformation of American Politics |edition=1st |publisher=[[Penguin Press]] |page=33  |isbn=978-0-3995-6314-0}}</ref>

LBJ Holding also had two small banks; they failed and were closed in 1991 by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]]. But the core Johnson radio properties survived and prospered. [[Emmis Communications]] bought [[KLBJ (AM)|KLBJ-AM]], [[KLBJ-FM]], [[KGSR]], and three other stations from LBJ Holding in 2003 for $105 million.<ref name="statesman16july07">{{cite news|last=Hawkins |first=Lori |url=http://www.statesman.com/news/content/shared/news/stories/ladybird/07/16/0716ladybiz.html |title=Lady Bird Johnson: Shrewd Work Made Her a Multimillionaire |newspaper=Austin American-Statesman |date=July 16, 2007 |accessdate=April 24, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Eventually, Lady Bird's initial $41,000 investment turned into more than $150 million for the LBJ Holding Company.<ref name="washpostbouquet"/>  She was the first president's wife to have become a millionaire in her own right before her husband was elected to office.<ref name="dallas news"/> She remained involved with the company until she was in her eighties.<ref name="washpostchamp"/>

==Second Lady of the United States==
[[John F. Kennedy]] chose Lyndon Johnson as his running mate for the 1960 election. At Kennedy's request, Lady Bird took an expanded role during the campaign, as his wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]] was pregnant with their second child. Over 71 days, Lady Bird traveled {{convert|35000|mi|km|-3}} through 11 states and appeared at 150 events.<ref name="washpostchamp"/>  Kennedy and Johnson won the election that November, with Lady Bird helping the Democratic ticket carry seven Southern states.<ref name="washpostchamp"/>

Reflecting later, Lady Bird said that the years her husband served as Vice President and she as Second Lady was "a very different period of our lives." Nationally, the two had a kind of celebrity, but they both found the office of Vice President to lack power.<ref name=Gillette334>{{cite book|title=Lady Bird Johnson: An Oral History|first=Michael L.|last=Gillette|page=334|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199908080|date=December 6, 2012}}</ref>

As the Vice President's wife, Lady Bird often served as a substitute for Jacqueline Kennedy at official events and functions.<ref name="oah">{{cite news|url=http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/firstladies/koman.html |title="... to leave this splendor for our grandchildren": Lady Bird Johnson, Environmentalist Extraordinaire |publisher=[[Organization of American Historians]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127221256/http://oah.org/pubs/magazine/firstladies/koman.html |archive-date=November 27, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> Within her first year as Second Lady, she had substituted for Mrs. Kennedy at more than 50 events, roughly one per week.<ref name=Hendricks305>{{cite book|title=America's First Ladies: A Historical Encyclopedia and Primary Document Collection of the Remarkable Women of the White House|pages=305–306|first=Nancy|last=Hendricks|year=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}</ref> This experience prepared Lady Bird for the following challenges of her unexpected years as First Lady.<ref name=Gillette334 />

On November 22, 1963, the Johnsons were accompanying the Kennedys in Dallas when President Kennedy was [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]]; they were two cars behind the President in his motorcade. Lyndon was sworn in as President on [[Air Force One]] two hours after Kennedy died, with Lady Bird and Jacqueline Kennedy by his side.<ref name="pbsassass" /> Afterward, Lady Bird created a tape on which she recorded her memories of the assassination, saying it was "primarily as a form of therapy to help me over the shock and horror of the experience." She submitted a transcript of the tape to the [[Warren Commission]] as testimony.

In the days following the assassination, Lady Bird worked with Jacqueline Kennedy on the transition of her husband to the White House. While having great respect for Jacqueline and finding her strong in the aftermath of the murder, Lady Bird believed from the start of her tenure as First Lady that she would be unfavorably compared to her immediate predecessor.<ref name="pbsassass">{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/ladybird/epicenter/epicenter_report_assassination.html|title=Lady Bird Johnson: The Assassination of President Kennedy|publisher=PBS}}</ref> On her last day in the White House, Jacqueline Kennedy left Lady Bird a note in which she promised she would "be happy" there.<ref>{{cite book|title=LBJ: Architect of American Ambition|page=442|first=Randall Bennett|last=Woods|year=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674026995}}</ref>

==First Lady of the United States==
As First Lady, Lady Bird started a capital beautification project<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://texasarchive.org/2010_00036|title=Showcase for the Nation: The Story of Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson's Beautification Program|website=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|access-date=December 3, 2019}}</ref> (''Society for a More Beautiful National Capital''). It was intended to improve physical conditions in [[Washington, D.C.]], for both residents and tourists, by planting millions of flowers, many of them on National Park Service land along roadways around the capital.<ref name="washpostbouquet">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/11/AR2007071101757.html | title=Lady Bird Johnson Gave America A Big Bouquet | first=Ann | last=Gerhart | work=The Washington Post | date=July 12, 2007}}</ref> She said, "Where flowers bloom, so does hope."

She worked extensively with the American Association of Nurserymen (AAN) executive Vice President Robert F. Lederer to protect wildflowers and promoted planting them along highways. Her efforts inspired similar programs throughout the country. She became the first president's wife to advocate actively for legislation<ref name="dallas news"/> when she was instrumental in promoting the [[Highway Beautification Act]], which was nicknamed "Lady Bird's Bill."<ref name="washpostchamp"/> It was developed to beautify the nation's highway system by limiting [[billboard (advertising)|billboards]] and by planting roadside areas. She was also an advocate of the [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]] program to give children from lower-income families a step up in school readiness.<ref name="dallas news"/>

Lady Bird created the modern structure of the First Lady's office: she was the first in this role to have a [[press secretary]] and chief of staff of her own, and an outside liaison with Congress.<ref name="washpostbouquet"/> Her press secretary from 1963 to 1969 was [[Liz Carpenter]], a fellow alumna of the University of Texas. As a mark of changing times, Carpenter was the first professional newswoman to become press secretary to a First Lady; she also served as Lady Bird's staff director. Lady Bird's tenure as First Lady marked the beginning of the hiring of employees in the East Wing to work specifically on the First Lady's projects.<ref name="dailytelegraph"/>

During the 1964 election, Lady Bird traveled through eight Southern states in her own [[train]] to promote the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]],<ref name="washpostbouquet"/> at one point giving 45 speeches over five days.<ref name="dailytelegraph"/>  It was the first solo whistle-stop tour by a First Lady.<ref name="npr94"/> President Johnson initially said he would turn down the Democratic Party nomination for president, having been unhappy during his service in President Kennedy's administration and believing the party did not want him. Although aides could not sway him, the First Lady convinced him otherwise, reassuring him of his worthiness and saying that if he dropped out, the Republicans would likely take the White House.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/09/we-should-pay-more-attention-to-the-candidates-spouses-they-have-more-power-than-we-realize/|title=We should pay more attention to the candidates' spouses.

Lady Bird continued her Whistlestop Tour in October 1964. She used a [[Braniff International Airways]] [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] turboprop aircraft to conduct a multi-state tour, with stops in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Indiana, and Kentucky. Braniff dubbed the Lockheed Electra "The Lady Bird Special," after the ground Whistlestop Tour Train.

On September 22, 1965, Lady Bird dedicated a [[Peoria, Illinois]], landscape plaza, President of the Peoria City Beautification Association Leslie Kenyon saying during the ceremony that she was the first presidential spouse "who has visited our city as an official guest in our 140 years of existence."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1965/09/23/page/24/article/lady-bird-dedicates-peorias-courthouse|title=Lady Bird Dedicates Peoria's Courthouse|date=September 23, 1965|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>

On September 22, 1966, Lady Bird dedicated the [[Glen Canyon Dam]] in northern [[Arizona]], fulfilling a goal that both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson had sought to accomplish. She said the dam belonged to all Americans amid an increasing concern for water that affected every American "no matter whether he lives in [[New York City|New York]] or [[Page, Arizona]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1966/09/23/page/15/article/lady-bird-attends-dam-rites|title=Lady Bird Attends Dam Rights|date=September 23, 1966|publisher=Chicago Tribune|first=Louise|last=Hutchinson}}</ref>

In mid-September 1967, Lady Bird began touring the [[Midwestern United States]] as part of a trip that one White House described as "mostly agriculture during the day and culture at night." President Johnson was then declining in support by farmers, months before a planned re-election bid.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1967/09/18/page/20/article/lady-bird-set-for-midwest-tour|title=Lady Bird Set for Midwest Tour|first=Louise|last=Hutchinson|date=September 18, 1967|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> Speaking to a crowd in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], on September 20, Lady Bird said problems within American cities were creating crime.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1967/09/21/page/78/article/mrs-johnson-tours-urges-life-on-farm|title=Mrs. Johnson Tours, Urges Life on Farm|first=Louise|last=Hutchinson|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=September 20, 1967}}</ref>

Toward the end of Johnson's first term, Lady Bird was anxious for her husband to leave office.<ref name=Dallek523>{{cite book|title=Flawed Giant: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961-1973|first=Robert|last=Dallek|page=523|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195132380}}</ref> In September 1967, Lady Bird voiced her concerns that a second term would be detrimental to his health.

In 1970, Lady Bird published ''A White House Diary,'' her intimate, behind-the-scenes account of her husband's presidency spanning November 22, 1963, to January 20, 1969. Beginning with President Kennedy's assassination, she recorded the momentous events of her times, including the [[Great Society]]'s [[War on Poverty]]; the national [[civil rights]] and social protest movements; her activism on behalf of the environment; and the [[Vietnam War]]. Johnson was acquainted with a long span of fellow First Ladies, from [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] to [[Laura Bush]]. She was protected by the [[United States Secret Service]] for 44 years.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Dozens-of-agents-to-join-in-mourning-Lady-Bird-1835469.php | title=Dozens of agents to join in mourning Lady Bird | first=Claudia | last=Feldman | date=July 13, 2007 | work=Houston Chronicle}}</ref>

Biographer Betty Boyd Caroli said in 2015 of Lady Bird that

<blockquote>She really invented the job of the modern first lady. She was the first one to have a big staff, the first one to have a comprehensive program in her own name, the first one to write a book about the White House years, when she leaves. She had an important role in setting up an enduring role for her husband with the LBJ Library. She's the first one to campaign extensively on her own for her husband.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/she-really-invented-job-lady-bird-johnson-and-rise-modern-first-lady|title='She really invented the job': Lady Bird Johnson and the rise of the modern first lady|publisher=St. Louis Public Radio|date=November 9, 2015| first=Kelly| last=Moffitt|accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref></blockquote>

Writing in 1986, William H. Inman observed that Lady Bird was considered by some "the most effective First Lady since [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]", citing her battles against highway billboard forests, auto heaps, and junk piles as well as her support for American public landscapes maintaining beauty and sanity.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/08/17/Claudia-Taylor-Lady-Bird-Johnson-A-front-row-seat-to-history/2362524635200/|title=Claudia Taylor 'Lady Bird' Johnson 'A front row seat to history'|publisher=UPI|date=August 17, 1986|first=William H.|last=Inman}}</ref>

==Later life==

Former President Johnson died of a heart attack in 1973, four years after leaving office.<ref name="dailytelegraph"/> When he suffered the heart attack, Lady Bird was in a meeting, and the former president had died when she reached him. She arranged for the body to lie in state at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library and Museum]] the following day, and the body was laid to rest two days later. The couple's elder daughter Lynda said that God "knew what he was doing" when her father died ahead of her mother; she thought her father would not have been able to live without Lady Bird.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/ladybird/windingdown/windingdown_index.html|title=Lady Bird Johnson: Winding Down|publisher=pbs.org}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Lady Bird focused her attention on the Austin riverfront area through her involvement in the [[Lady Bird Lake|Town Lake]] Beautification Project.

During the 1976 United States presidential election, Democratic nominee [[Jimmy Carter]] apologized to Lady Bird over comments he made about her husband during an interview in which he stated he would not follow trends of "lying, cheating, and distorting the truth" set forth by former Presidents Nixon and Johnson.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8_tS2Vw13FcC&dat=19760923&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Lady Bird Johnson Gets Carter Apology For Comment On Husband|publisher=Toledo Blade|date=September 23, 1976}}</ref>

On March 12, 1980, Lady Bird returned to the White House and attended a reception commemorating the fifteenth anniversary of the Head Start program.

The conference featured over 150 speakers and 1,500 attendees from all 50 states and 10 foreign countries.

In 1986, 13 years after her husband's death, Lady Bird's health began to fail.
