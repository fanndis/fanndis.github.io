==Vision==

The Global Poverty Project's vision is a world without extreme poverty, within a generation. To reach this end the Project utilises the power of education, communications, advocacy, campaigning and the media to try and advance the movement to end extreme poverty.

They focus on building a global movement for change: mobilising people to make a difference now, and changing the systems and policies that keep people in poverty.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Steve|title=Extreme-poverty warrior Hugh Evans brings the rock to Central Park|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/music/extreme-poverty-warrior-hugh-evans-brings-the-rock-to-central-park|accessdate=24 October 2012|newspaper=Time Out, New York|date=27 September 2012}}</ref>

They do this in two ways:

• Campaigning for government, business and consumer action that will create important systemic change for the world's extreme poor,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Global Poverty Project: About|url=http://globalpovertyproject.com/pages/about_us|publisher=The Global Poverty Project|accessdate=24 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305204610/http://globalpovertyproject.com/pages/about_us|archive-date=5 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  and

===End Polio===

Since July 2011, the Global Poverty Project has worked with Rotary and its '''End Polio''' campaign. Rotary has been working to eradicate polio for more than 30 years. The goal of ridding the world of this disease is closer than ever.

As a founding partner of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, Rotary, End Polio and its Partners reduced polio cases by 99.9 percent since the first project to vaccinate children in the Philippines in 1979. This campaign focuses on sharing the story of progress towards [[polio eradication]], while aiming to build public support and momentum required to close the funding gap that is limiting global eradication efforts.

Since launch the campaign has gained signatures from more than 25,000 people and secured an additional $118 million in pledges for polio eradication.<ref>{{cite news|title=$50m pledge to stamp out polio|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/50m-pledge-to-stamp-out-polio-20111029-1mp71.html|accessdate=26 October 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=29 October 2011}}</ref>

In October 2011 the campaign brought 4,000 people together at The End Polio campaign in Perth, where artists, local celebrities, polio survivors and former [[Australia]]n Prime  Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] spoke about the importance of polio eradication. The next day 4 Governments and the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] committed an additional $118 million to global polio eradication efforts.
