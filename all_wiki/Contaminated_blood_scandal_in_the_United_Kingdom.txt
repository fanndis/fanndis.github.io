The '''Contaminated Blood Scandal''' in the United Kingdom arose when at least 3,891 people, most of whom suffered from [[haemophilia]], became infected with [[hepatitis C]] of whom 1,243 were also infected with [[HIV]], the virus that leads to [[HIV/AIDS|acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS), as a result of receiving [[Contaminated haemophilia blood products|contaminated clotting factor products]] supplied by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in the 1970s and 1980s. As of October 2017 there were at least 1,246 confirmed deaths in the UK of people who were killed by the clotting agents Factor VIII & Factor IX and the viruses they transmitted. Some have estimated that the total number of those who have died could be as high as 2,400 though exact figures are not known.

During the 1970s and 1980s, some people were infected with Hepatitis C via blood transfusions under entirely different circumstances. However, the Factor Concentrate products used by people with haemophilia were processed pharmaceutical products which bore no resemblance to blood transfusion. The infections to those with haemophilia were principally caused by the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] derived product known as [[Factor VIII]], a medicinal product that was sourced from the United States and elsewhere. The creation of such products involved dangerous manufacturing processes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2011/aug/04/bad-blood-cautionary-tale/|title=Bad Blood: A Cautionary Tale|website=Kpbs.org}}</ref> Large groups of paid donors were used (as many as 60,000 per batch, and including prisoners and drug addicts); it only required one infected donor to contaminate an entire batch, which would then infect all of the patients that received that material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hemophilia.in/index.php/patient-education/product-safety|title=Hemophilia Federation (India) – Product Safety|website=Hemophilia.in}}</ref> In contrast, this was at a time when the practice of paying donors for [[whole blood]] in the United States had effectively ceased; the UK did not import whole blood<ref>{{cite web|last1= Glenarthur |first1=Simon|title=Blood: Licensing Requirements|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1983/dec/05/blood-licensing-requirements|website=Hansard|publisher=House of Lords}}</ref> from abroad, but it did import large quantities of Factor VIII given to those infected (as described in the documentary ''[[Factor 8: The Arkansas Prison Blood Scandal]]''). It is said that the principal reason that the UK imported these products was that it did not produce enough of its own.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/aug/19/NHS.medicineandhealth|title=Owen demands inquiry into infected blood scandal|first1=James|last1=Meikle|date=19 August 2002|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1557187/HIV-blood-disaster-papers-were-pulped.html|title=HIV blood disaster papers 'were pulped'|website=Telegraph.co.uk|date=2007-07-11}}</ref>

A study published in 1986 showed that 76% of those who used commercial Factor products became infected with HIV, as opposed to none of those who only used the previous treatment [[cryoprecipitate]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gill |first1=Joan C. |last2=Menitove |first2=Jay E. |last3=Anderson |first3=Philip R. |last4=Casper |first4=James T. |last5=Devare |first5=Sushilkumar G. |last6=Wood |first6=Charles |last7=Adair |first7=Stuart |last8=Casey |first8=James |last9=Scheffel |first9=Christi |last10=Montgomery |first10=Robert R. |title=HTLV-III serology in hemophilia: Relationship with immunologic abnormalities |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |date=April 1986 |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=511–516 |doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(86)80824-1 |pmid=3083075 |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1175&context=virologypub}}</ref>

No government, healthcare or pharmaceutical entity in the UK has admitted any liability in the scandal, and no [[damages]] or compensation have been paid to those infected or affected, although the government has provided some means-tested benefits to some of the surviving victims through a Trust.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |title=The Macfarlane Trust| url=http://www.macfarlane.org.uk/|website=Macfarlane.org.uk |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304164529/http://www.macfarlane.org.uk/ | archive-date=2012-03-04 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Background ==
[[Haemophilia]] is a mostly [[hereditary|inherited]] [[genetic disorder]] that impairs the body's ability to [[coagulation|clot]], a process needed to [[hemostasis|stop bleeding]].<ref name=NIH2013What>{{cite web|title=What Is Hemophilia?|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hemophilia|website=NHLBI|accessdate=8 September 2016|date=13 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=CDC2014>{{cite web|title=Hemophilia Facts|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hemophilia/facts.html|website=CDC|accessdate=8 September 2016|date=26 August 2014}}</ref> This results in people [[bleeding]] longer after an injury, easy [[bruising]], and an increased risk of [[hemarthrosis|bleeding inside joint]]s or other parts of the body.

Some people can now be cured from Haemophilia altogether,<ref>{{cite web|title=Gene therapy used to treat haemophilia|url=https://www.nhs.uk/news/genetics-and-stem-cells/gene-therapy-used-to-treat-haemophilia/|website=nhs.uk|date=2011-12-12}}</ref> but modern "synthetic" or "non-human derived" Factor products such as Recombinant Factor VIII<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Franchini |first1=M |title=Plasma-derived versus recombinant Factor VIII concentrates for the treatment of haemophilia A: recombinant is better. |journal=Blood Transfusion |date=October 2010 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=292–6 |doi=10.2450/2010.0067-10 |pmid=20967172 |pmc=2957496 }}</ref> continue to be widely used. Factor products work by replacing the missing Factor proteins, which can take place at home or in hospital. The clotting factors are made either from [[Blood plasma|Plasma]] or by [[Protein production|recombinant methods]]. In the 1970s, haemophiliacs began to be treated with "Factor Concentrates", which were sold as a revolutionary treatment. The consequential increase in use led to pharmaceutical companies seeking substantial supplies of plasma, and thousands of donors including prisoners, drug addicts, prostitutes and people known to be infected with HIV or hepatitis were allowed or even paid to give their plasma.

Some of the most famous examples of risky plasma harvesting are those of [[Luckner Cambronne]] who became known as "The Vampire of the Caribbean"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pepin|first1=Jacques|title=The Origins of AIDS|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139501415|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dTaMBrPBK6EC&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=luckner+cambronne+plasma#v=onepage&q=luckner%20cambronne%20plasma&f=false|language=en}}</ref> and also Crysosan Ltd, a company based in [[Canada]] that was found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of harvesting plasma from the bodies of dead Russians and [[relabelling|re-labelling]] it as originating from Swedish donors.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Ridgeway|first1=James|title=It's All for Sale: The Control of Global Resources|url=https://archive.org/details/itsallforsalecon0000ridg|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/itsallforsalecon0000ridg/page/184 184]|quote=cryosan russian.|publisher=Duke University Press|language=en|date=2004|isbn=978-0822333746}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Arkansas Bloodsuckers: the Clintons, Prisoners and the Blood Trade|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/04/arkansas-bloodsuckers-the-clintons-prisoners-and-the-blood-trade/|website=Counterpunch.org|language=en-us|date=4 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Blood money|url=https://www.salon.com/1998/12/24/cov_23news/|website=Salon.com|language=en|date=1998-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Dobbin |first=Murray |date=2003 |title=Paul Martin: CEO for Canada? |url=https://archive.org/details/paulmartinceofor0000dobb |url-access=registration |location=Toronto |publisher= James Lorimer & Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/paulmartinceofor0000dobb/page/31 31] |isbn=9781550287998}}</ref>

Plasma donations could be collected using a process called [[plasmapheresis]]. In addition to NHS derived Factor produced by [[Bio Products Laboratory]] (BPL), manufacturers that supplied clotting factor products to the UK during the mid-1970s and 1980s included Abbott (Profilate), Armour Pharmaceuticals (Factorate), [[Bayer]]-owned [[Cutter Laboratories|Cutter]] (Koate), [[Baxter International]]-owned Travenol/Hyland (Hemofil/Interhem), Immuno (Kryobulin) and Speywood (Humanate).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taintedblood.info/tb/tlfiles/Brands%20of%20Concentrates%20Used%20in%20UK%20in%201980%20and%201981.pdf |title=Quantities of FVIII Concentrate Used in UK Haemophiliacs: Breakdown by Manufacturer |publisher=Department of Health Freedom of Information release DH_Vol_29_May_1983_Jun_1983 |website=TaintedBlood.info |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite archive |first= Clinical Trial Certificate |last=Speywood Laboratories Ltd |date = 9 March 1983 |series = BN |file =116 |box=244 |collection = Committee on Safety of Medicines: Sub-Committee on Biological Products |institution =The National Archives (TNA) |location = Kew, London}}</ref>

== 1973 - 1986 - Hepatitis ==
The dangers of factor concentrates had been raised since their inception. In 1974, American scientist [[Judith Graham Pool]] (who previously discovered the frozen blood product [[cryoprecipitate]], a safer treatment) described the products as "dangerous" and "unethical" and warned against their use. The [[World Health Organization]] also warned the UK not to import blood from countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis, such as the United States.<ref name=PE1449>{{cite magazine |date=28 July 2017 |title=Justice delayed |magazine=[[Private Eye]] |location=London |publisher=Pressdram Ltd }}</ref>

In May 1975, the World Health Organization passed a widely circulated resolution urging all countries to aim at self-sufficiency in blood-products.

In September 1975, an article was published detailing occurrences of a new kind of Hepatitis.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/337714 |title=Hepatitis Types B and Non-B, Epidemiologic Background|website=jamanetwork.com}}</ref>

In December 1975 an episode of the ''[[World in Action]]'' programme highlighted the danger of Hepatitis from imported Factor products.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/finalreport/pdf/PEN0131400.PDF |title=World in Action - "Blood Money"|website=Penroseinquiry.org.uk}}</ref>

By the end of 1978 more than 50% of the Factor VIII used in England was being imported from overseas. This was because the country had failed to become self-sufficient in its own supplies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=P |title=Factor VIII supply and demand. |journal=BMJ |date=21 June 1980 |volume=280 |issue=6230 |pages=1531–1532 |doi=10.1136/bmj.280.6230.1531 |pmid=6770954 |pmc=1601689 }}</ref>

The BPL,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpl.co.uk/about-bpl/|title=About BPL – Bio Products Laboratory Ltd.|website=Bpl.co.uk|access-date=13 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029184734/http://www.bpl.co.uk/about-bpl/|archive-date=29 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> which manufactured UK blood products, ran into continual trouble from under-funding. The Archer Report said, "In July 1979, the Medicines Inspectorate visited BPL. They reported that the buildings were never designed for the scale of production envisaged. They commented: 'If this were a commercial operation we would have no hesitation in recommending that manufacture should cease until the facility was upgraded to a minimum acceptable level'. BPL was rescued by Crown Immunity. Among their recommendations the Inspectorate advised: 'Under no circumstances should production of any product be increased under the existing manufacturing conditions'. Meanwhile, the existing plant continued production, relying on Crown Immunity to dispense with all the requirements of the Medicines Act, but was able to meet only about 40% of the national requirements."

A study published in December 1983 showed conclusively that the risk to a haemophiliac of contracting Hepatitis C by using untreated Factor products was 100% upon first exposure.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fletcher |first1=M L |last2=Trowell |first2=J M |last3=Craske |first3=J |last4=Pavier |first4=K |last5=Rizza |first5=C R |title=Non-A non-B hepatitis after transfusion of factor VIII in infrequently treated patients. |journal=BMJ |date=10 December 1983 |volume=287 |issue=6407 |pages=1754–1757 |doi=10.1136/bmj.287.6407.1754 |pmid=6416577 |pmc=1549875 }}</ref>

== 1981 - 1986 - HIV ==
In July 1982, the American [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported that at least 3 haemophiliacs there had developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, 2 had died, and all 3 had used untreated Factor products.<ref>{{cite web |title=1982- AIDS is Discovered Among Hemophilia Patients |url=http://www.hemophiliafed.org/news-stories/2014/03/aids_and_hemophilia/ |website=Hemophilia Federation of America |date=17 March 2014}}</ref> The CDC said that "the occurrence among the three hemophiliac cases suggests the possible transmission of an agent through blood products".

In March 1983, the CDC reported that "Blood products or blood appear responsible for AIDS among hemophilia patients".<ref>{{cite web |title=1983—CDC Determines that AIDS is Spread Through Infected Blood - Hemophilia Federation of America |url=http://www.hemophiliafed.org/news-stories/2014/03/1984-cdc-determines-that-aids-is-spreading-through-infected-blood/ |website=Hemophilia Federation of America |date=17 March 2014}}</ref>

In May 1983 Dr N. S. Galbraith, director of the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre in England and Wales, sent a paper entitled "Action on AIDS" to Dr Ian Field at the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] in London informing him of the death from AIDS of a haemophiliac who had received Factor VIII concentrate imported from the United States. Galbraith stated: "I have reviewed the literature and come to the conclusion that all blood products made from blood donated in the USA after 1978 should be withdrawn from use until the risk of AIDS transmission by these products has been clarified ... I am most surprised that the USA manufacturers of the implicated blood products have not informed their customers of this new hazard. I assume no critical warning has been received in the United Kingdom?"<ref>{{cite web|title=Preliminary Report Chapter 8: HIV and AIDS|url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/preliminary-report/chapter-8/#footnote-10795-30-backlink|website=Penroseinquiry.org.uk|language=en}}</ref> Despite Galbraith's warning the products were not withdrawn: a Department of Health letter considered that his suggestion was "premature".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/preliminary-report/chapter-8/|title=Preliminary Report Chapter 8: HIV and AIDS|website=Penroseinquiry.org.uk}}</ref>

In September 1983 a leaflet distributed to UK blood donors answered the question as to whether AIDS could be transmitted by blood-products to be "Almost certainly yes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/finalreport/pdf/SGH0026675.PDF|title=Brochure : Aids and how it concerns blood donors|website=Penroseinquiry.org.uk}}</ref>

In November 1983 the UK Health Minister, Ken Clarke told parliament that "There is no conclusive evidence that AIDS is transmitted by blood products" and the importation of infected products continued. When giving evidence to the Penrose Inquiry, Dr Mark Winter said that at the time Ken Clarke made this statement "all haemophilia clinicians by this stage clearly believed that commercial blood products could and were transmitting AIDS".<ref>{{cite web |title=Final Report: Chapter 9 - Knowledge of the Geographical Spread and Prevalence of HIV/AIDS 1 |url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/finalreport/text/354876_chapter_9.html#footnote-042-backlink |website=Penroseinquiry.org.uk |language=en}}</ref>

In January 1984, Lord Glenarthur (Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the DHSS) said that "It remains the case that there is no conclusive evidence of the transmission of AIDS through blood products, although the circumstantial evidence is strong",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/finalreport/pdf/SGH0076160.PDF|title=Letter to Government|website=Penroseinquiry.org.uk|accessdate=11 February 2019}}</ref> and again the use of untreated Factor products and importation continued.

== 2000 - Destroyed Evidence Investigation ==
In April 2000 the Department of Health published an internal audit to examine the loss of records relating to Hepatitis C litigation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Flint|first1=Caroline|title=Destroyed Documents (Blood Products)|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060523/text/60523w0029.htm|website=Hansard|publisher=House of Commons}}</ref> The report concluded that "an arbitrary and unjustified decision, most likely taken by an inexperienced member of staff, was responsible for the destruction of a series of files containing the minutes and background papers of the Advisory Committee on the Virological Safety of Blood (ACSVB)".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58a18aeb2e69cf7248eeddbc/t/5b1a74a9352f53bcbf9a4c8c/1528460512936/DH+Audit+on+GEB.pdf|title=Internal Audit Review - Hepatitis C Litigation - Final Report|date=April 2000|website=Squarespace.com|accessdate=28 November 2019}}</ref>

== 2009 – The Archer Report ==
In the early 2000s the former Solicitor General for England and Wales, [[Peter Archer, Baron Archer of Sandwell|Lord Archer]], campaigned for an inquiry into the tainted blood scandal alongside [[David Owen|Lord Owen]], who was the Health Minister from 1974 to 1976, [[Patrick Jenkin, Baron Jenkin of Roding|Lord Jenkin]], former Shadow Health Secretary, and others. They were unsuccessful.

In a 1990 episode of ''[[The Cook Report]]'', Owen said: "I can see why some people would be unhappy with having all the facts revealed because it will show negligence".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cook Report – Profits Before Patients|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb1Kb-WvW2o|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> In September 2016 Owen gave a speech in London during which he said the scandal had been covered-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqt0xXz-saw|title=Lord David Owen – Bad Blood Speech 29/9/16|date=30 September 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

Archer chaired a privately funded independent investigation set up in 2007. The Archer Report was published in 2009 and aimed to uncover the causes of the events that led to the thousands of infections and deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/delays-led-to-thousands-receiving-contaminated-blood-1629555.html|title=Delays Led to Thousands Receiving Contaminated Blood|author=Sam Marsden|website=Independent.co.uk|date=23 February 2009|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> The report held no legal or official status and was unable to subpoena witnesses or demand the disclosure of documents.<ref name=PE1449/> Nonetheless, it sought to address the issue of missing evidence and documents relating to the scandal. For example, the ministerial papers of Lord Owen had been destroyed. "We have been unable to ascertain who carried out the destruction of the papers, and who gave the instructions. But the conclusion appears inescapable that some official made a decision which he or she had no authority to make, or that someone was guilty of a serious error of judgement. The consequence is that Lord Owen has done his best to recollect details of events a quarter of a century ago, but both he, and we, have been deprived of the primary sources", Archer reported. Lord Jenkin also voiced his difficulties obtaining documents for the inquiry, although the report stated: "He subsequently received from the Department two bundles of documents. One of these was to be treated as confidential". Lord Jenkin felt that the destruction of records was deliberate, and done "in order to draw a line under the disaster".<ref name="Archer Report">{{Cite book |title=The Archer Inquiry |year=2009 |quote=On 13 April 2005 Lord Jenkin met Sir Nigel, who apologised for the original reply. Lord Jenkin was left with the clear impression from their subsequent conversation that all the files bearing upon the issue of contaminated blood products had been destroyed, and that this had been done 'with intent, in order to draw a line under the disaster'. |url=http://www.archercbbp.com/files/report/76_Lord%20Archer%20Report.DOC |access-date=1 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703132440/http://www.archercbbp.com/files/report/76_Lord%20Archer%20Report.DOC |archive-date=3 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Another handling error is described in the inquiry: "mishandling of documents arose in connection with a number of files relating to the Advisory Committee on the Virological Safety of Blood between May 1989 and February 1992 which were found to be missing". The report went on to state: "They were in fact destroyed over a period from July 1994 to March 1998". When summarising these events it is stated "some of those who gave evidence to us suspected that there was an exercise in suppressing evidence of negligence or misconduct."

== 2015 – Scottish Penrose Inquiry ==
{{Main|Penrose Inquiry}}
In 2008 the Scottish government announced [[Penrose Inquiry|a public inquiry]] into the scandal covering Scotland only, to be chaired by [[George William Penrose, Lord Penrose|Lord Penrose]]. The inquiry's terms of reference outlined five deaths that were to be examined, but only one of those victims was a haemophiliac and that person had been infected with hepatitis C in the 1960s, before the factor concentrates were introduced.

Published in 2015, the inquiry was described as a [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewash]] and waste of public money (over £12 million) by critics after it made just one recommendation and failed to apportion any blame in the scandal. Its recommendation was to offer blood tests to anyone in Scotland who had a blood transfusion before 1991 and who had not already been tested for hepatitis C.

== 2017 – Legal action and UK public inquiry ==
In July 2017 a group legal action ''Jason Evans & Ors'' was brought against the government on behalf of more than 500 people by Collins Solicitors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Momentum in Contaminated Blood Scandal grows as Collins apply for a Group Litigation Order – Collins Solicitors Press Release dated 4 July 2017|url=http://www.collinslaw.co.uk/post.php?s=2017-07-04-momentum-in-contaminated-blood-scandal-grows-as-collins-apply-for-a-group-litigation-order-collins-solicitors-press-release-dated-4-july-2017|website=Collinslaw.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ITV News – Families seek justice in Blood Scandal – 4th July 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vCLXW4Mm5o|date=4 July 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> After years of increasing pressure from campaigners and [[Member of parliament|MP]]s, Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced a full UK-wide public inquiry into the scandal.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Peter|last2=Topping|first2=Alexandra|title=Theresa May orders contaminated blood scandal inquiry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/11/contaminated-blood-scandal-theresa-may-orders-inquiry|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-40601013|title=Blood probe 'lessons must be learned'|work=BBC News|date=14 July 2017|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref> In September 2017 a court ruling found in favour of the victims allowing them to launch a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] action to seek damages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41406105|title=Victims win contaminated blood ruling|date=26 September 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=26 September 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/news/uk/victims-and-families-can-bring-high-court-action-on-contaminated-blood-products/|title=Victims and families can bring High Court action on contaminated blood products|date=26 September 2017|work=Evening Express|access-date=26 September 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926200244/https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/news/uk/victims-and-families-can-bring-high-court-action-on-contaminated-blood-products/|archive-date=26 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2017-09-26/victims-and-families-win-high-court-ruling-to-seek-damages-over-contaminated-blood-products/|title=Victims and families win High Court ruling to seek damages over contaminated blood products|work=ITV News|access-date=26 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>

== 2018 – False ministerial statements withdrawn ==
In June 2018 the Department of Health issued an apology, because for two years Ministers had told Parliament that in relation to Contaminated Blood Scandal evidence: "All documents up to 1995 are available through the National Archive".<ref>{{cite web |title=Blood: Contamination:Written question – 65851 |url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2017-02-27/65851/ |website=UK Parliament |language=en}}</ref>

== 2019 – Files still missing ==
In February 2019, it emerged that around 450 files had been taken from the archives by staff from the Department of Health and Social Security, and not returned, sparking concerns among campaigners that the department was attempting a cover-up.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/contaminated-blood-scandal-documents-nhs-hiv-hepatitis-haemophilia-factor-8-cover-up-a8773716.html|title=Cover-up fears as hundreds of contaminated blood files 'vanish' before inquiry can see them|date=11 February 2019|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=11 February 2019}}</ref>

== Government support ==
Successive governments, both [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], have been criticised for their handling of the case, limited support schemes and refusal to conduct a public inquiry (until 2017). Some limited support has been provided to selected individuals through [[charitable trust]]s<ref name="auto"/> which is often subject to [[means test]]ing, though no damages or compensation have ever been paid to UK victims or their families.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harpin|first1=Lee|title=Victims of contaminated blood scandal weren't given Tory compensation|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/victims-contaminated-blood-scandal-werent-10854692|website=mirror|date=22 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=In the urgent question on 16...: 21 Jan 2016: House of Commons debates - TheyWorkForYou|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2016-01-21b.1583.1|website=TheyWorkForYou|language=en}}</ref>

In 1991 the Conservative government made £42 million available to those affected by HIV,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2014-10-20/211081/|title=Blood: Contamination: Written question – 211081|website=UK Parliament|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref> this equates to around £29,000 on average between the 1,437 people who received a payment.

In 2017 the Conservatives announced more funds for those with first-stage chronic hepatitis C, but this additional money was reportedly to be sourced from funds for other tainted blood victims. The Department of Health was accused of robbing one set of victims to pay another. Officials stated that it had made available an extra £125 million, more than any previous government, but critics said this money was simply accounted for as a cost to the NHS of extending treatments to hepatitis C sufferers sooner.<ref name=PE1440>{{cite magazine |date=24 March 2017 |title=What a Hunt |magazine=[[Private Eye]] |location=London |publisher=Pressdram Ltd }}</ref>
