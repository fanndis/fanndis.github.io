'''Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio''' (born March 10, 1994), known by his stage name '''Bad Bunny''', is a Puerto Rican [[rapper]], singer, and songwriter. His music is often defined as [[Latin trap]] and [[reggaeton]], but he has incorporated various other genres into his music, including rock, [[Bachata (music)|bachata]], and [[Soul music|soul]]. He is also known for his deep, slurred vocal style and his eclectic fashion sense. Throughout his career, Bad Bunny has frequently collaborated with artists such as [[J Balvin]], [[Ozuna (singer)|Ozuna]], [[Farruko]], [[Residente]], [[Arcángel (singer)|Arcángel]], [[Jhay Cortez]], and [[Daddy Yankee]]. 

Born and raised in the municipality of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, Bad Bunny gained popularity on [[SoundCloud]] and was eventually signed to a record label while working in a supermarket as a bagger and studying at the [[University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo]]. Following the release of his breakthrough single "Soy Peor" in late 2016, he rose to stardom after collaborating with [[Cardi B]] and [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] on the singles "[[I Like It (Cardi B, Bad Bunny and J Balvin song)|I Like It]]" and "[[Mia (Bad Bunny song)|Mia]]", which charted on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at number one and number three, respectively. His debut album ''[[X 100pre]]'' (2018) was awarded a [[Latin Grammy Award|Latin Grammy]] for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Music Album|Best Urban Music Album]]. His collaborative album with [[J Balvin]], ''[[Oasis (J Balvin and Bad Bunny album)|Oasis]]'' (2019), contains the popular singles "[[Qué Pretendes]]" and "[[La Canción]]". 

In early 2020, he performed at the [[Super Bowl LIV halftime show]] as a guest, alongside [[Shakira]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-bowl-halftime-shakira-jennifer-lopez-performance-pictures/|title=Shakira and Jennifer Lopez deliver electrifying Super Bowl 2020 halftime show performance|publisher=[[CBS News]]|access-date=March 19, 2020}}</ref> and became the first [[Urbano music|Latin urban]] music artist on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. Bad Bunny's second studio album, ''[[YHLQMDLG]]'' (''{{lang|es|Yo hago lo que me da la gana}}'') (2020), became the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number two, followed by the release of the compilation album ''[[Las que no iban a salir]]'' (2020), two months later without [[surprise album|prior announcement]]. His third solo studio album ''[[El Último Tour Del Mundo]]'' was released in November 2020.

Speaking about his distance from the Puerto Rican music industry, Bad Bunny stated, "I'm from Vega Baja, a small area that's not a metropolis like San Juan where the majority of the genre's artists have come from. That's what's most surprising and incredible about this – I simply came from nothing, and that's that. When I was at school, I used to stay on a balcony singing and people would stand around listening."<ref name="rolling stone">{{Cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bad-bunny-latin-trap-concert-tour-w517474 |title=Bad Bunny: The Four-Billion-Stream Man Leading the Latin Trap Explosion |last=Light |first=Elias |date=April 2, 2018 |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=June 28, 2018}}</ref> He has stated that, when he was young, his mother wanted him to grow up to be an engineer, his father preferred that he be a baseball player, while a teacher told him that he would become a firefighter.
