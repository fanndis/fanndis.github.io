Grace King was built in the late 1960s as a high school, opening its doors in 1968 as an all-girls public school serving Jefferson Parish; remaining such until the 1980s, when it became [[Coeducation|co-ed]].

The school, which now serves Grades 9–12, is a part of the [[Jefferson Parish Public Schools]] system. The school serves unincorporated portions of Jefferson Parish and a portion of the city of [[Kenner, Louisiana|Kenner]]. The school was named for [[Grace King]] (d. 1932), a [[New Orleans]] writer and scholar of Louisiana history. The school's mascot is Lucky, the (Fighting Irish) [[Leprechaun]], and the school colors are [[Shades of green#Hunter green|hunter green]], white, and gold.

During [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|Hurricane Katrina]] in late August 2005, the school suffered damage to its gymnasium's roof, and housed a National Guard troop until the school reopened in October 2005. Grace King High School recently completed building a [[Miniature golf|minigolf]] course that is accessible to students who are confined to [[wheelchair]]s or crutches.
