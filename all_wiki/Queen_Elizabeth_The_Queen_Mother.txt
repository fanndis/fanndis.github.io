'''Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon''' (4 August 1900 – 30 March 2002) was the wife of [[King George VI]], and the mother of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]]. She was [[List of British royal consorts|Queen of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s from her husband's accession in 1936 until his death in 1952, after which she was known as '''Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother''',<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=55932|date=4 August 2000|page=8617|supp=y}} {{London Gazette|issue=56653|date=5 August 2002|page=1|supp=y}} {{London Gazette|issue=56969|date=16 June 2003|page=7439}}</ref> to avoid confusion with her daughter. She was the last [[Empress consort of India]].

Born into a family of [[British nobility]], she came to prominence in 1923 when she married the Duke of York, the second son of [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. The couple and their daughters embodied traditional ideas of family and public service.<ref>Roberts, pp. 58–59</ref> She undertook a variety of public engagements and became known for her consistently cheerful countenance.<ref>{{citation|author=British Screen News|title=Our Smiling Duchess|publisher=British Screen Productions|location=London|year=1930}}</ref>

In 1936, her husband unexpectedly became king when his older brother, [[Edward VIII]], [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] in order to marry the American divorcée [[Wallis Simpson]]. Elizabeth then became queen. She accompanied her husband on diplomatic tours to France and North America before the start of the [[Second World War]]. During the war, her seemingly indomitable spirit provided moral support to the British public. After the war, her husband's health deteriorated, and she was widowed at the age of 51. Her elder daughter, aged 25, became the new queen.

After the death of Queen Mary in 1953, Elizabeth was viewed as the matriarch of the [[British royal family]]. In her later years, she was a consistently popular member of the family, even when other members were suffering from low levels of public approval.<ref name=moore/> She continued an active public life until just a few months before her death at the age of 101 years, 238 days, which was seven weeks after the death of her younger daughter, Princess Margaret.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the youngest daughter and the ninth of ten children of [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Claude Bowes-Lyon]], [[Lord Glamis]] (later the 14th [[Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]] in the [[Peerage of Scotland]]), and his wife, [[Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck]]. Her mother was descended from [[British Prime Minister]] [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland]], and [[Governor-General of India]] [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]], who was the elder brother of another Prime Minister, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]].{{efn|name=campbell|[[Lady Colin Campbell]] claims Elizabeth's biological mother was the family cook, Marguerite Rodiere, by means of a surrogacy arrangement that was not uncommon in aristocratic families at the time. This theory is dismissed by royal biographers such as Michael Thornton and [[Hugo Vickers]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9177647/Queen-Mother-was-daughter-of-French-cook-biography-claims.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|title=Queen Mother was daughter of French cook, biography claims|date=31 March 2012}}</ref> In an earlier allegation, published by [[Kitty Kelley]] in 1997, Elizabeth's mother is said to have been a Welsh maid.<ref>{{citation|last1=Beck|first1=Joan|title=Royal Muck: $27 Down The Drain|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-10-05/news/9710050469_1_kitty-kelley-queen-mother-prince-philip|accessdate=16 February 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|date=5 October 1997}}</ref>}}

The location of her birth remains uncertain, but reputedly she was born either in her parents' [[Westminster]] home at [[Grosvenor Gardens House|Belgrave Mansions]], [[Grosvenor Gardens, London|Grosvenor Gardens]], or in a horse-drawn ambulance on the way to a hospital.<ref>{{citation|first=Alison|last=Weir|authorlink=Alison Weir (historian)|title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy, Revised edition|publisher=Pimlico|location=London|year=1996|isbn=978-0-7126-7448-5|page=330}}</ref> Other possible locations include Forbes House in [[Ham, London]], the home of her maternal grandmother, [[Louisa Cavendish-Bentinck|Louisa Scott]].<ref>Shawcross, p. 15</ref> Her birth was registered at [[Hitchin]], [[Hertfordshire]],<ref>Civil Registration Indexes: Births, General Register Office, England and Wales. Jul–Sep 1900 Hitchin, vol. 3a, p. 667</ref> near the Strathmores' [[English country house]], [[St Paul's Walden Bury]], which was also given as her birthplace in the [[United Kingdom Census 1901|census the following year]].<ref>1901 England Census, Class RG13, piece 1300, folio 170, p. 5</ref> She was christened there on 23 September 1900, in the local parish church, All Saints, and her godparents included her paternal aunt Lady Maud Bowes-Lyon and cousin [[Venetia James]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings|title=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page|author=Demoskoff, Yvonne|date=27 December 2005|access-date=27 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806125845/http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings|archive-date=6 August 2011}}</ref>
[[File:Glamis Castle 2004-04-08 (2).jpg|thumb|right|[[Glamis Castle]], the Strathmores' Scottish home]]
She spent much of her childhood at [[St Paul's Walden]] and at [[Glamis Castle]], the Earl's ancestral home in Scotland. She was educated at home by a governess until the age of eight, and was fond of field sports, ponies and dogs.<ref>Vickers, p. 8</ref> When she started school in London, she astonished her teachers by precociously beginning an essay with two [[Greek language|Greek]] words from [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''. Her best subjects were literature and scripture. After returning to private education under a German Jewish governess, Käthe Kübler, she passed the [[OCR (examination board)|Oxford Local Examination]] with distinction at age thirteen.<ref>Vickers, pp. 10–14</ref>

On her fourteenth birthday, Britain [[World War I|declared war]] on [[German Empire|Germany]]. Four of her brothers served in the army. Her elder brother, [[Fergus Bowes-Lyon|Fergus]], an officer in the [[Black Watch]] Regiment, was killed in action at the [[Battle of Loos]] in 1915. Another brother, Michael, was reported missing in action on 28 April 1917.<ref>Shawcross, p. 85</ref> Three weeks later, the family discovered he had been captured after being wounded. He remained in a [[prisoner of war]] camp for the rest of the war. Glamis was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers, which Elizabeth helped to run. She was particularly instrumental in organising the rescue of the castle's contents during a serious fire on 16 September 1916.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 79–80</ref> One of the soldiers she treated wrote in her autograph book that she was to be "Hung, drawn, & quartered&nbsp;... Hung in diamonds, drawn in a coach and four, and quartered in the best house in the land."<ref>Forbes, p. 74</ref>

==Marriage to Prince Albert==
{{main|Wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon}}

[[Prince Albert, Duke of York]]—"Bertie" to the family—was the second son of [[George V|King George V]]. He initially proposed to Elizabeth in 1921, but she turned him down, being "afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to".<ref name="ezard">{{citation|last=Ezard|first=John|title=A life of legend, duty and devotion |newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 April 2002|page=18}}</ref> When he declared he would marry no other, his mother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], visited Glamis to see for herself the girl who had stolen her son's heart. She became convinced that Elizabeth was "the one girl who could make Bertie happy", but nevertheless refused to interfere.<ref>{{citation|last=Airlie |first=Mabell |authorlink=Mabell Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie|title=Thatched with Gold|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London|year=1962|page=167}}</ref> At the same time, Elizabeth was courted by [[James Stuart, 1st Viscount Stuart of Findhorn|James Stuart]], Albert's [[equerry]], until he left the Prince's service for a better-paid job in the American oil business.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 133–135</ref>
[[File:Wedding of Princess Mary and Viscount Lascelles 1922.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth (back row second from left) as a bridesmaid at the wedding of Princess Mary and Viscount Lascelles, 1922]]
In February 1922, Elizabeth was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Albert's sister, [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Mary]], to [[Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood|Viscount Lascelles]].<ref>Shawcross, pp. 135–136</ref> The following month, Albert proposed again, but she refused him once more.<ref>Shawcross, p. 136</ref> Eventually, in January 1923, Elizabeth agreed to marry Albert, despite her misgivings about royal life.<ref>Longford, p. 23</ref> Albert's freedom in choosing Elizabeth, not a member of a royal family, though the daughter of a peer, was considered a gesture in favour of political modernisation; previously, princes were expected to marry princesses from other royal families.<ref>Roberts, pp. 57–58; Shawcross, p. 113</ref> They selected a platinum engagement ring featuring a [[Kashmir]] sapphire with two diamonds adorning its sides.<ref name="Vintage Royal Wedding">{{citation|url=http://www.vintageroyalwedding.co.uk/elizabeth-bowes-lyons-ring|title=Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon's Engagement Ring|accessdate=13 April 2014 |publisher=Vintage Royal Wedding |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031122859/http://www.vintageroyalwedding.co.uk/elizabeth-bowes-lyons-ring|archivedate=31 October 2013}}</ref>

They married on 26 April 1923, at [[Westminster Abbey]].

==Duchess of York (1923–1936)==
[[File:Philip de László - Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon 1925.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait by [[Philip de László]], 1925]]
After a successful visit to [[Northern Ireland]] in July 1924, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government agreed that Albert and Elizabeth could tour East Africa from December 1924 to April 1925.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 218–219</ref> The Labour government was defeated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in a [[1924 United Kingdom general election|general election]] in November (which Elizabeth described as "marvellous" to her mother)<ref>Letter from Elizabeth to Lady Strathmore, 1 November 1924, quoted in Shawcross, p. 217</ref> and the [[Governor-General]] of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], Sir [[Lee Stack]], was assassinated three weeks later. Despite this, the tour went ahead, and they visited [[Aden Protectorate|Aden]], [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]], and Sudan, but Egypt was avoided because of political tensions.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 221–240</ref>

[[File:Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The Duchess of York in [[Queensland]], 1927]]
Albert had a stammer, which affected his ability to deliver speeches, and after October 1925, Elizabeth assisted in helping him through the therapy devised by [[Lionel Logue]], an episode portrayed in the 2010 film ''[[The King's Speech]]''. In 1926, the couple had their first child, Princess Elizabeth—"Lilibet" to the family—who would later become [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. Albert and Elizabeth, without their child, [[Royal visits to Australia|travelled to Australia]] to open [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]] in 1927.<ref>{{citation|url= http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/The%20House%20of%20Windsor%20from%201952/QueenElizabethTheQueenMother/Royaltours.aspx|title=Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother> Royal tours|publisher=Official web site of the British monarchy|accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref> She was, in her own words, "very miserable at leaving the baby".<ref>Elizabeth's diary, 6 January 1927, quoted in Shawcross, p. 264</ref> Their journey by sea took them via Jamaica, the Panama Canal and the Pacific; Elizabeth fretted constantly over her baby back in Britain, but their journey was a public relations success.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 266–296</ref> She charmed the public in Fiji when, shaking hands with a long line of official guests, a stray dog walked in on the ceremony and she shook its paw as well.<ref>Shawcross, p. 277</ref> In New Zealand she fell ill with a cold and missed some engagements, but enjoyed the local fishing<ref>Shawcross, pp. 281–282</ref> in the [[Bay of Islands]] accompanied by Australian sports fisherman [[Harry Andreas]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article54884539 |title=Royal anglers|newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]]|location=Adelaide|date=25 February 1927|accessdate=1 September 2012|page=9|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> On the return journey, via Mauritius, the Suez Canal, Malta and Gibraltar, their transport, {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}, caught fire and they prepared to abandon ship before the fire was brought under control.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 294–296.</ref>

Her second daughter, [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret Rose]], was born at Glamis in 1930.

==Accession and abdication of Edward VIII==
{{main|Abdication of Edward VIII}}
On 20 January 1936, [[George V|King George V]] died and Albert's brother, Edward, Prince of Wales, became [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]]. George had expressed private reservations about his successor, saying, "I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne."<ref>{{citation|last=Ziegler|first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Ziegler|title=King Edward VIII: The Official Biography|location=London|publisher=Collins|year=1990|page=199|isbn=978-0-00-215741-4}}</ref>

Just months into his reign, Edward forced a [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|constitutional crisis]] by insisting on marrying the American divorcée [[Wallis Simpson]]. Although legally Edward could have married Simpson, as King he was also head of the [[Church of England]], which at that time did not allow divorced people to remarry. Edward's ministers believed that the people would never accept Simpson as Queen and advised against the marriage. As a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]], Edward was obliged to follow ministerial advice.<ref>{{citation|last=Beaverbrook|first=Lord|authorlink=Max Aitken, Baron Beaverbook|title=The Abdication of King Edward VIII|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|location=London|editor-last=Taylor|editor-first=A. J. P.|editor-link=A. J. P. Taylor|year=1966|page=57}}</ref>

Rather than abandon his plans to marry Simpson, he chose to abdicate in favour of Albert,<ref>The Duke of Windsor (1951). ''A King's Story''. London: Cassell and Co., p. 387</ref> who reluctantly became King in his place on 11 December 1936 under the [[regnal name]] of George VI. George VI and Elizabeth were [[Coronation of George VI and Elizabeth|crowned]] King and Queen of Great Britain, Ireland and the [[Dominion|British Dominions]], and [[Emperor of India|Emperor and Empress]] of [[British Raj|India]] in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 12 May 1937, the date previously scheduled for Edward VIII. [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth's crown]] was made of platinum and was set with the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond.<ref>Shawcross, p. 397</ref>

Edward and Simpson married and became the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, but while Edward was a Royal Highness, George VI withheld the style from the Duchess, a decision that Elizabeth supported.<ref>Letter from George VI to Winston Churchill in which the King says his family shared his view, quoted by Howarth, p. 143</ref> Elizabeth was later quoted as referring to the Duchess as "that woman",<ref>Michie, Alan A. (17 March 1941) ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]'', quoted by Vickers, p. 224</ref> and the Duchess referred to Elizabeth as "Cookie", because of her supposed resemblance to a fat Scots cook.<ref name="moore"/> Claims that Elizabeth remained embittered towards the Duchess were denied by her close friends; the [[Hugh FitzRoy, 11th Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]] wrote that she "never said anything nasty about the Duchess of Windsor, except to say she really hadn't got a clue what she was dealing with."<ref>Hogg and Mortimer, pp. 84–85</ref>

==Queen consort (1936–1952)==
===State visits and royal tour===
[[File:Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait by Sir [[Gerald Kelly]]. [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Her crown]] is on the left.]]

In summer 1938, a state visit to France by the King and Queen was postponed for three weeks because of the death of the Queen's mother, Lady Strathmore. In two weeks, [[Norman Hartnell]] created an all-white trousseau for the Queen, who could not wear colours as she was still in [[Mourning#White mourning|mourning]].<ref>Shawcross, pp. 430–433</ref> The visit was designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>Shawcross, p. 430</ref> The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell's wardrobe.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 434–436</ref>

Nevertheless, Nazi aggression continued, and the government prepared for war. After the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938 appeared to forestall the advent of armed conflict, the British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] was invited onto the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]] with the King and Queen to receive acclamation from a crowd of well-wishers.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 438–443</ref> While broadly popular among the general public, [[Appeasement|Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler]] was the subject of some opposition in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], which led historian [[John Grigg (writer)|John Grigg]] to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as "the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century".<ref>[[Christopher Hitchens|Hitchens, Christopher]] (1 April 2002) [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/apr/01/queenmother.monarchy9 "Mourning will be brief"], ''The Guardian'', retrieved 1 May 2009.</ref> However, historians argue that the King only ever followed ministerial advice and acted as he was constitutionally bound to do.<ref>{{citation|last=Sinclair|first=David|title=Two Georges: the Making of the Modern Monarchy|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=1988|page=230|isbn=978-0-340-33240-5}}</ref>

According to an often-told story, during one of the earliest of the royal couple's repeated encounters with the crowds, a [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] veteran asked Elizabeth, "Are you [[Scottish people|Scots]] or are you English?"

===Second World War===
[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt, King George VI, Queen Elizabeth in London, England - NARA - 195320.png|thumb|right|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] (centre), King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in London, 23 October 1942]]
During the [[Second World War]], the King and Queen became symbols of the fight against fascism.<ref>Shawcross, p. 515</ref> Shortly after the declaration of war, ''[[The Queen's Book of the Red Cross]]'' was conceived.

Though the King and Queen spent the working day at Buckingham Palace, partly for security and family reasons they stayed at night at [[Windsor Castle]] about {{convert|20|mi}} west of central London with the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret.

In the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 British general election]], Churchill's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] was soundly defeated by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] of [[Clement Attlee]].

During the 1947 royal tour of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], Elizabeth's serene public behaviour was broken, exceptionally, when she rose from the royal car to strike an admirer with her umbrella because she had mistaken his enthusiasm for hostility.<ref>Bradford, p. 391; Shawcross, p. 618</ref> The 1948 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed because of the King's declining health.

==Queen mother (1952–2002)==
===Widowhood===
Shortly after George VI's death, Elizabeth began to be styled as ''Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother'' because the normal style for the widow of a king, "Queen Elizabeth", would have been too similar to the style of her elder daughter, now Queen Elizabeth II.<ref>{{citation|publisher=CBC News|last=McCluskey|first=Peter|title=Elizabeth: The Queen Mother|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/obit/queenmother|accessdate=1 May 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828142509/http://www.cbc.ca/news/obit/queenmother|archivedate=28 August 2013}}</ref> Popularly, she became the "Queen Mother" or the "Queen Mum".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002170,00.html|title=Elizabeth, Queen Consort, 1900–2002: A Mum for All Seasons|journal=Time|date=8 April 2002|last=Iyer|first=Pico|access-date=16 February 2017}}</ref> She was devastated by her husband's death and retired to Scotland. However, after a meeting with the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, she broke her retirement and resumed her public duties.<ref>Hogg and Mortimer, p. 161</ref> Eventually she became just as busy as [[queen mother]] as she had been as queen consort. In July 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] with Princess Margaret. She laid the [[foundation stone]] of the [[University of Zimbabwe|University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland—the current University of Zimbabwe]].<ref>Shawcross, pp. 686–688; Vickers, p. 324</ref> Upon her return to the region in 1957, Elizabeth was inaugurated as the College's President, and attended other events that were deliberately designed to be multi-racial.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 710–713</ref> During her daughter's extensive tour of the Commonwealth over 1953–54, Elizabeth acted as a [[Counsellor of State]] and looked after her grandchildren, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]] and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne]].<ref>Shawcross, pp. 689–690</ref> In February 1959, she visited Kenya and Uganda.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/2001414/queen-elizabeth-the-queen-mother-at-the-west-of-kenya-show-eldoret-kenya|title=Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother at the West of Kenya Show, Eldoret, Kenya Feb 1959|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/2602350/visit-of-her-majesty-queen-elizabeth-the-queen-mother-kenya-uganda-1959|title=Visit of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Kenya, Uganda, 1959|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref>

[[File:H.M. The Queen Mother Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth at [[Dover Castle]], by [[Allan Warren]]]]
Elizabeth oversaw the restoration of the remote [[Castle of Mey]], on the north coast of Scotland, which she used to "get away from everything"<ref>Vickers, p. 314</ref> for three weeks in August and ten days in October each year.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.castleofmey.org.uk/castleofmeyhistory.cfm?PageID=8|title=The Queen Elizabeth Castle Of Mey Trust|accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> She developed her interest in horse racing, particularly [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]], which had been inspired by the amateur jockey [[Anthony Bingham Mildmay, 2nd Baron Mildmay of Flete|Lord Mildmay]] in 1949.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 703–704</ref> She owned the winners of approximately 500 races. Her distinctive colours of blue with buff stripes were carried by horses such as Special Cargo, the winner of the 1984 [[Bet365 Gold Cup|Whitbread Gold Cup]], and [[Devon Loch]], which spectacularly halted just short of the winning post at the 1956 [[Grand National]]<ref>Shawcross, p. 790</ref> and whose jockey [[Dick Francis]] later had a successful career as the writer of racing-themed [[detective stories]]. [[Peter Cazalet (racehorse trainer)|Peter Cazalet]] was her [[Horse training|trainer]] for over 20 years. Although (contrary to rumour) she never placed bets, she did have the racing commentaries piped direct to her London residence, [[Clarence House]], so she could follow the races.<ref>Vickers, p. 458</ref> As an art collector, she purchased works by [[Claude Monet]], [[Augustus John]] and [[Peter Carl Fabergé]], among others.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/the-collectors/queen-elizabeth|title=Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|publisher=The Royal Collection|accessdate=31 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921144532/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/the-collectors/queen-elizabeth|archivedate=21 September 2012}}</ref>

In February 1964, Elizabeth had an emergency appendectomy, which led to the postponement of a planned tour of Australia, New Zealand and Fiji until 1966.<ref>Shawcross, p. 806</ref> She recuperated during a Caribbean cruise aboard the royal yacht, [[HMY Britannia|''Britannia'']].<ref>Shawcross, p. 807</ref> In December 1966, she underwent an operation to remove a tumour after she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Contrary to rumours, she did not have a [[colostomy]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8259474.stm|title=Queen Mother 'had colon cancer'|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=22 September 2009|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>Shawcross, p. 817</ref> She was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in 1984 and a lump was removed from her breast. Her bouts with cancer were never made public during her lifetime.<ref>Shawcross, p. 875</ref>

In 1975, Elizabeth visited Iran at the invitation of Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. The British ambassador and his wife, Anthony and Sheila Parsons, noted how the Iranians were bemused by her habit of speaking to everyone regardless of status or importance, and hoped the Shah's entourage would learn from the visit to pay more attention to ordinary people.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 822–823</ref> Between 1976 and 1984, she made annual summer visits to France,<ref>Shawcross, pp. 827–831</ref> which were among 22 private trips to continental Europe between 1963 and 1992.<ref>Shawcross, p. 835</ref>

In 1982, Elizabeth was rushed to hospital when a fish bone became stuck in her throat, and had an operation to remove it. Being a keen [[angling|angler]], she calmly joked afterwards, "The salmon have got their own back."<ref name="straits">{{citation|title=Queen of Quips|journal=The Straits Times|date=7 August 2000}}</ref> Similar incidents occurred at [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] in August 1986, when she was hospitalised at [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]] overnight but no operation was needed,<ref>Shawcross, p. 878; Vickers, p. 449</ref> and May 1993, when she was admitted to the Infirmary for surgery under [[general anaesthetic]].<ref>{{citation|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/262249.stm|title=Queen Mother recovers after operation|accessdate=8 August 2013|date=25 January 1999}}</ref>

In 1987, Elizabeth was criticised when it emerged that two of her nieces, [[Nerissa and Katherine Bowes-Lyon|Katherine and Nerissa Bowes-Lyon]], had both been committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]] because they were severely handicapped. However, ''[[Burke's Peerage]]'' had listed the sisters as dead, apparently because their mother, Fenella (Elizabeth's sister-in-law), "was 'extremely vague' when it came to filling in forms and might not have completed the paperwork for the family entry correctly".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9988709.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522210832/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9988709.html|archive-date=22 May 2013|first=Neil|last=MacKay|title=Nieces abandoned in state-run mental asylum and declared dead to avoid public shame|journal=The Sunday Herald|date=7 April 2002|accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref> When Nerissa died the year before, her grave was originally marked with a plastic tag and a serial number.

===Centenarian===
In her later years, Elizabeth became known for her longevity. Her 90th birthday—4 August 1990—was celebrated by a parade on 27 June that involved many of the 300 organisations of which she was patron.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 732, 882</ref> In 1995, she attended events commemorating the end of the war fifty years before, and had two operations: one to remove a cataract in her left eye, and one to replace her right hip.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 903–904</ref> In 1998, her left hip was replaced after it was broken when she slipped and fell during a visit to [[Sandringham House|Sandringham]] stables.<ref>Shawcross, p. 912</ref>

Elizabeth's 100th birthday was celebrated in a number of ways: a parade that celebrated the highlights of her life included contributions from Sir [[Norman Wisdom]] and Sir [[John Mills]];<ref>{{citation|publisher=BBC|title=Birthday pageant for Queen Mother|date=19 July 2000|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/841740.stm|accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref> her image appeared on a special commemorative £20 note issued by the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]];<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.rampantscotland.com/SCM/qetqm100.htm|title=Commemorative Bank Note for 100th Birthday of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|publisher=Rampant Scotland|accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref> and she attended a lunch at the [[Guildhall, London]], at which [[George Carey]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], accidentally attempted to drink her glass of wine. Her quick admonition of "That's mine!" caused widespread amusement.<ref>Vickers, p. 490</ref> In November 2000, she broke her collarbone in a fall that kept her recuperating at home over Christmas and the New Year.<ref>Shawcross, p. 925</ref>

On 1 August 2001, Elizabeth had a blood transfusion for anaemia after suffering from mild heat exhaustion, though she was well enough to make her traditional appearance outside Clarence House three days later to celebrate her 101st birthday.<ref>{{citation|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1470869.stm|title=Queen Mother leaves hospital|date=2 August 2001|accessdate=28 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{citation|publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1473418.stm|title=Queen Mother's 101st birthday|date=4 August 2001|accessdate=28 August 2013}}</ref> Her final public engagements included planting a cross at the [[Field of Remembrance]] on 8 November 2001;<ref>{{citation|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1644906.stm|title=Queen Mother attends memorial event|date=8 November 2001|accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref> a reception at the Guildhall, London, for the reformation of the [[No. 600 Squadron RAF|600 Squadron, Royal Auxiliary Air Force]] on 15 November;<ref>{{citation|publisher=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/royalty/6840783/Pictures-of-the-decade-the-Royal-family.html?image=6|title=Pictures of the decade: the Royal family|accessdate=15 September 2013|date=18 December 2009}}</ref> and attending the re-commissioning of {{HMS|Ark Royal|R07|6}} on 22 November.<ref>{{citation|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1785119.stm|title=Queen Mother 'better all the time'|date=27 January 2002|accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/mar/30/queenmother.monarchy10|title=Queen Mother dies peacefully, aged 101|date=30 March 2002|work=The Guardian|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref>

In his official biography, [[William Shawcross]] portrays Elizabeth as a person whose indomitable optimism, zest for life, good manners, mischievous sense of humour, and interest in people and subjects of all kinds contributed to her exceptional popularity and to her longevity. Sir [[Hugh Casson]] said Elizabeth was like "a wave breaking on a rock, because although she is sweet and pretty and charming, she also has a basic streak of toughness and tenacity.&nbsp;... when a wave breaks on a rock, it showers and sparkles with a brilliant play of foam and droplets in the sun, yet beneath is really hard, tough rock, fused, in her case, from strong principles, physical courage and a sense of duty."<ref>Hogg and Mortimer, p. 122</ref> Sir [[Peter Ustinov]] described her during a student demonstration at the [[University of Dundee]] in 1968:{{quote|As we arrived in a solemn procession the students pelted us with toilet rolls. They kept hold of one end, like streamers at a ball, and threw the other end. The Queen Mother stopped and picked these up as though somebody had misplaced them. [Returning them to the students she said,] 'Was this yours? Oh, could you take it?' And it was her sang-froid and her absolute refusal to be shocked by this, which immediately silenced all the students. She knows instinctively what to do on those occasions. She doesn't rise to being heckled at all; she just pretends it must be an oversight on the part of the people doing it. The way she reacted not only showed her presence of mind, but was so charming and so disarming, even to the most rabid element, that she brought peace to troubled waters.<ref>Hogg and Mortimer, pp. 212–213</ref>}}

Elizabeth was well known for her dry witticisms. On hearing that [[Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Edwina Mountbatten]] was buried at sea, she said: "Dear Edwina, she always liked to make a splash."<ref name="straits"/> Accompanied by the gay writer Sir [[Noël Coward]] at a gala, she mounted a staircase lined with Guards. Noticing Coward's eyes flicker momentarily across the soldiers, she murmured to him: "I wouldn't if I were you, Noël; they count them before they put them out."<ref name="blaikie">{{citation|first=Thomas|last=Blaikie|title=You look awfully like the Queen: Wit and Wisdom from the House of Windsor|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London, UK|year=2002|isbn=978-0-00-714874-5}}</ref>

After being advised by a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Minister in the 1970s not to employ homosexuals, Elizabeth observed that without them, "we'd have to go self-service".<ref name="blaikie"/> On the fate of a gift of a [[Nebuchadnezzar (wine)|nebuchadnezzar]] of champagne (20 bottles' worth) even if her family did not come for the holidays, she said, "I'll polish it off myself."<ref>{{citation|first=Graham|last=Taylor|title=Elizabeth: The Woman and the Queen|publisher=Telegraph Books|year=2002|page=93}}</ref> Emine Saner of ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggests that with a [[gin]] and [[Dubonnet]] at noon, red wine with lunch, a [[Port wine|port]] and [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]] at 6&nbsp;pm and two glasses of champagne at dinner, "a conservative estimate puts the number of [[Unit of alcohol|alcohol units]] she drank at 70 a week".<ref>{{citation|last=Saner|first=Emine|title=Bring back the magic hour|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/25/monarchy.features11|accessdate=24 March 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 July 2006}}</ref> Her lifestyle amused journalists, particularly when it was revealed she had a multi-million [[pound sterling|pound]] overdraft with [[Coutts]] Bank.<ref>{{citation|first=Christopher|last=Morgan|title=The Sunday Times|date=14 March 1999}}</ref>

The [[Cunard Line|Cunard White Star Line's]] [[RMS Queen Elizabeth|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] was named after her. She launched the ship on 27 September 1938 in [[Clydebank]], Scotland.
