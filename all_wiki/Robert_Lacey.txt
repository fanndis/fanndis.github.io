==Career==

Lacey's 1981 work ''The Kingdom,'' about the [[Saudi royal family]], and its 2009 follow-up ''Inside the Kingdom'' have now both been cited as standard study texts for the diplomatic community working inside the Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[David Brancaccio]] said: "In Saudi Arabia, Robert Lacey had the kind of access most journalists only dream of."<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/cove-media/http/PBS_CP_NOW/70/650/transcript.html – PBS Transcript: Rehab for Terrorists?]</ref>

To research and write the book Lacey took his wife and children to live for two and a half years in [[Jeddah]] in the late 1970s. Friends he made there included journalist [[Jamal Khashoggi]]. Lacey co-wrote his last three articles before Khashoggi was murdered in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5428177/jamal-khashoggi-breakfast/|title=Jamal Khashoggi Was My Co-Writer and My Friend.
