'''Griffin Boyette Bell''' (October 31, 1918 – January 5, 2009) was the 72nd [[Attorney General of the United States]] and previously was a [[United States federal judge|U.S. Circuit Judge]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]].

==Education and career==
Born on October 31, 1918, in [[Americus, Georgia|Americus]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He served in the [[United States Army]] from 1942 to 1946 in the Quartermaster Corps and Transportation Corps. He was stationed at [[Fort Lee (Virginia)|Fort Lee]], Virginia. He attained the rank of major. After leaving the army, Bell received a [[Bachelor of Laws]] in 1948 from [[Mercer University School of Law]]. He entered private practice in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia from 1948 to 1952. He was in private practice in [[Rome, Georgia|Rome]], Georgia from 1952 to 1953 and then was in private practice at [[King & Spalding]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia from 1953 to 1961. He was Chief of Staff to [[Governor of Georgia|Governor]] [[Ernest Vandiver]] from 1959 to 1961.

==Federal judicial service==
Bell received a [[recess appointment]] from President [[John F. Kennedy]] on October 5, 1961, to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], to a new seat authorized by 75 Stat. 80. He was nominated to the same position by President Kennedy on January 15, 1962. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on February 5, 1962, and received his commission on February 9, 1962. He served as a board member of the [[Federal Judicial Center]] from 1973 to 1976. His service terminated on March 1, 1976, due to his resignation.

===Role in the 1966 Georgia gubernatorial election===
In the aftermath of the disputed [[1966 Georgia gubernatorial election]] between Democrat [[Lester Maddox]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Howard Callaway|Howard "Bo" Callaway]], Bell joined Republican Judge [[Elbert Tuttle]] in striking down the Georgia constitutional provision requiring that the legislature chose the governor if no [[general election]] candidate receives a majority of the vote. The judges concluded that a malapportioned legislature might "dilute" the votes of the candidate with a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], in this case Callaway. Bell compared legislative selection to the former [[County Unit System]], a kind of [[electoral college]] formerly used in Georgia to select the governor but invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Bell and Tuttle granted a temporary suspension of their ruling to permit appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and stipulated that the state could resolve the deadlock so long as the legislature not make the selection. In a five-to-two decision known as ''Fortson v. Morris'', the high court struck down the Bell-Tuttle legal reasoning and directed the legislature to choose between Maddox and Callaway. Two liberal justices, [[William O. Douglas]] and [[Abe Fortas]] had argued against legislative selection of the governor, but the court majority, led this time by [[Hugo Black]], took the [[strict constructionist]] line and cleared the path for Maddox's ultimate election.<ref>Billy Hathorn, "The Frustration of Opportunity: Georgia Republicans and the Election of 1966", ''[[Atlanta History: A Journal of Georgia and the South]]'', XXI (Winter 1987-1988), pp. 46-47</ref>

Bell briefly returned to private practice in Atlanta in 1976. President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed Bell [[Attorney General of the United States]] in 1977, serving until 1979.

On April 10, 1978, Attorney General Bell announced the indictment of former Acting FBI Director [[L. Patrick Gray]], [[Mark Felt]] and former FBI Assistant Director Edward Miller for authorizing break-ins of New York City radical political activists. Bell introduced requirements that any authorized illegal activities must be made in writing. Five Department of Justices attorneys resigned over the alleged reluctance of the Attorney Bell to pursue others in the department for illegal activities related to domestic spying.<ref>Theoharis, Athan G.
