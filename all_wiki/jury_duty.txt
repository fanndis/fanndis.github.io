==Juror selection process==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=April 2016}}
{{Main|Jury selection}}

The [[prosecutor]] and [[Defense (legal)|defense]] can dismiss potential jurors for various reasons, which can vary from one state to another, and they can have a specific number of arbitrary dismissals, or unconditional [[peremptory challenge]], which does not require specific reasons. The judge can also dismiss potential jurors.

Some courts had been sympathetic to jurors' privacy concerns and refer to jurors by number, and conduct ''[[voir dire]]'' ''[[in camera]]'' (i.e., in private). In the United States, there have also been [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] challenges and medical privacy (e.g., [[HIPAA]]) objections to this.<ref>Hannaford P.

==Australia==
Australia uses an [[adversarial system]], and potential jurors are randomly selected from an [[electoral roll]].

Jurors receive a small payment for each day of attendance. Employers are also required to pay their employees "make-up pay", that is, the usual pay the employee would have earned from working, less the jury duty payment received from the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jury duty|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/community-service-leave/jury-duty|website=[[Fair Work Ombudsman]]|publisher=[[Australian Government]]|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref> Under the [[National Employment Standards]], make-up pay is required only for the first ten days of jury service; however, the laws of Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia extend the make-up pay requirement for the entire duration of the jury service.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nedim|first1=Ugur|title=What Does Jury Duty Pay?|url=https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/what-does-jury-duty-pay/|website=Sydney Criminal Lawyers|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>

===New South Wales===
The jury system in New South Wales is administered by the Jury Services Branch of the Office of the Sheriff of New South Wales, an office in the [[Department of Attorney General and Justice (New South Wales)|New South Wales Department of Attorney General and Justice]], and operates in accordance with the ''Jury Act 1977''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/scanact/inforce/NONE/0 |title=NSW Legislation |publisher=Legislation.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref> and ''Jury Amendment Act 2010''. These laws detail persons who are disqualified, ineligible, or may be excused from jury service. In addition, the ''Jury Exemption Act 1965''<ref>[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A07386 ''Jury Exemption Act 1965''] — ComLaw, Australian Government</ref><ref>{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|jea1965203|Jury Exemption Act 1965}}</ref> and section 7, "Excuse for cause",<ref>[http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/lrc/ll_lrc.nsf/pages/LRC_r117chp07 Report 117 (2007) – Jury selection: 7.

According to 2016 figures from the [[Ministry of Justice]], there is about a 35% chance of people in England and Wales being summoned for jury service over the course of their lifetime. In Scotland the percentage is much higher due to having a lower population as well having juries made up of 15 people (as opposed to 12 people in England and Wales).<ref>{{cite news|title=What is the chance of being called for jury service?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-36140259|publisher=BBC|date=17 March 2017}}</ref>

When a person is called for jury duty in the [[United States]], that service is mandatory, and the person summoned for jury duty must attend. Failing to report for jury duty is illegal and results in a wide range of penalties, from simply being placed back into the selection pool to immediate criminal prosecution and having a [[Arrest_warrant#Bench_warrant|bench warrant]] issued for [[contempt of court]].<ref name="judiciary.state.nj.us">{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/juryreporting/juryfqa.pdf |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Juror Service in New Jersey |website=New Jersey Judiciary Court System |date=June 2017 |accessdate=2017-09-07}}</ref><ref name="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/07/us/florida-juror-overslept-contempt-vacated-trnd/index.html">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/07/us/florida-juror-overslept-contempt-vacated-trnd/index.html |title=The judge who sentenced a man to 10 days in jail for oversleeping jury duty clears his record |website=CNN |date=October 2019 |accessdate=2019-10-10}}</ref> Employers are not allowed to fire an employee for being called to jury duty, but they are typically not required to pay salaries during this time.<ref name="judiciary.state.nj.us"/> Jury duty reimbursement is as little as $5 per day, although a juror can plead to be excused for financial hardship.<ref name="https://www.nj.com/news/2011/07/rough_economy_makes_filling_nj.html">{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2011/07/rough_economy_makes_filling_nj.html |title=Rough economy makes filling N.J. juries more difficult, experts say |website=Star Ledger |date=July 2011 |accessdate=2019-10-06}}</ref> A citizen who reports to jury duty may be asked to serve as a juror in a trial or as an alternate juror, or they may be dismissed.

In the United States, government employees are in a paid status of leave (in accordance with {{usc|5|6322}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/us/2010/title5/|title=Title 5: Government Organization and Employees — Justia|website=Law.justia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref>) for the duration spent serving as a juror (also known as court duty or court leave by some organizations). Many quasi-governmental organizations have adopted this provision into their contract manuals.<ref name="judiciary.state.nj.us"/> Accordingly, government employees are in a paid status as long as they have received a summons in connection with a judicial proceeding, by a court or authority responsible for the conduct of that proceeding to serve as a juror (or witness) in the District of Columbia or a state, territory, or possession of the United States, [[Puerto Rico]], or the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]].

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has held, in ''[[Butler v. Perry]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=240&invol=328 240 U.S. 328] (1916), that the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] does not prohibit "enforcement of those duties which individuals owe to the state, such as services in the army, militia, on the jury, etc.".

In both the United States and Canada, jurors having conscientious objection to service are generally excused from service. This chiefly includes religious groups such as the [[Amish]], [[Conservative Mennonites]], and [[Old Order Mennonites]].{{cn|date=September 2019}}

==={{vanchor|Jury scam}} in the United States===
In recent years, US citizens have been targets of a "jury scam", wherein they are called by persons posing as officers from a court, claiming that the person did not show up for jury duty and that charges will be pressed. Potential victims of [[identity theft]] or [[identity fraud|fraud]], these targets are then told that the matter can be resolved if personal information is given. The [[US Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] recommends that recipients of these calls contact the court directly to avoid falling victim to this scam.<ref name="uscourts1">{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/JuryService/JurorScams.aspx |title=Juror Scams |website=Uscourts.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref>

[[United States federal courts|Federal courts]] mostly use the [[USPS]] (United States Postal Service) in their communications with prospective jurors, and any calls that are made will never ask for personal information.<ref name="uscourts1"/>
