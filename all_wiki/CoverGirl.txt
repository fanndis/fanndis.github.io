'''CoverGirl''' is an American cosmetics brand founded in Maryland, United States, by the [[Noxell Corporation|Noxzema Chemical Company]]. It was acquired by [[Procter & Gamble]] in 1989 and later acquired by [[Coty, Inc.]] in 2016.<ref>http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2016/10/03/p-g-is-officially-a-lot-smaller-this-morning.html</ref> The Noxell Company advertised this cosmetics line by allowing "cover girls", models, actresses, and singers who appear on the front cover of women's magazines, to wear its products. CoverGirl primarily provides a wide variety of consumer-grade cosmetics.

== History ==
CoverGirl's first product line, Clean Makeup, launched in 1961. It was nominated as America's best cosmetic brand.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Originally offering only six products, it was advertised as being a "medicated face makeup" as it used Noxzema's medicated ingredients of [[camphor]], [[menthol]], and [[eucalyptus]].

In 1963, model (and later, actress) [[Jennifer O'Neill]] signed on as CoverGirl spokeswoman at the age of fifteen, appearing in both print and television advertising that year.<ref name="jenniferoneill.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.jenniferoneill.com/pages/video_CoverGirl.html|title=The Official Jennifer O'Neill Website – CoverGirl Video|website=jenniferoneill.com|accessdate=6 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115030829/http://jenniferoneill.com/pages/video_CoverGirl.html/|archive-date=15 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Her unprecedented thirty-year endorsement of the product catapulted CoverGirl into being the top-selling makeup line in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jenniferoneill.com/pages/biography.php|title=The Official Jennifer O'Neill Website – Biography|website=jenniferoneill.com|accessdate=6 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115030828/http://jenniferoneill.com/pages/biography.php/|archive-date=15 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Cybill Shepherd]] was one of CoverGirl's earliest models, appearing in several print and television advertisements for the brand. In contrast to the "made-up" looking fashion models of the late 1960s, Shepherd demonstrated a fresh, wholesome look, appealing to a younger consumer's taste. These advertisements established the "girl-next-door" look that CoverGirl would become associated with.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh_N5iVHBRc|title=Cybill Sheperd 1969 Commercial|last=echozgus|date=27 July 2008|accessdate=6 April 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>

Sales of the line increased during 1985 due to an advertising campaign featuring supermodel [[Christie Brinkley]]. In 1997, CoverGirl launched what is now the famous slogan, "Easy, breezy, beautiful…" This was meant to imply the products would give the user a natural look. This eventually led to an increase of sales, and a larger audience of teenage girls was effectively targeted.<ref name="Covergirl">[http://news.covergirl.com/about/history]. Accessed on 2016-1-24.</ref> The products of the line are still in production, and continue changing as new ideas come along.<ref name="Clean Makeup">[http://www.pg.com/en_US/brands/beauty_grooming/covergirl.shtml PG.com COVERGIRL: age-defying, Clean Makeup, award winning]. PG.com Retrieved on 2012-10-11.</ref>
