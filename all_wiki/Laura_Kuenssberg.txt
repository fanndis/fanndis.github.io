==Career==
After returning to the UK, she worked for local radio and then cable television in Glasgow, before joining [[BBC North East and Cumbria]] in March 2000 as a trainee journalist. Kuenssberg won a regional [[Royal Television Society]] award for her work as home affairs correspondent,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.org.uk/Information_page_+_3_pic_det.asp?id=2790&sec_id=547|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925020213/http://www.rts.org.uk/Information_page_%2B_3_pic_det.asp?id=2790&sec_id=547|url-status=dead|title=Royal Television Society – RTS in your area|archive-date=25 September 2006}}</ref> and produced segments for the social affairs editor [[Niall Dickson]].

Appointed chief political correspondent for [[BBC News]], Kuenssberg reported for [[BBC One]] bulletins, ''[[Daily Politics]]'' and the [[BBC News channel]]. In May 2010, her presence on [[BBC Television]] was so ubiquitous in the period between the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]] and the formation of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition]], that journalist [[David Aaronovitch]] coined the term "Kuenssbergovision".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article7124535.ece |title=New Politics is here.

In September 2011, Kuenssberg took up the newly created role of business editor for [[ITV News]], and was replaced at BBC News by [[Norman Smith (journalist)|Norman Smith]] from [[BBC Radio 4]]. She also contributed towards business reporting on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s current affairs strand, ''[[Tonight (1999 TV programme)|Tonight]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://corporate.itn.co.uk/about-itn/media-centre/press-release/Laura_Kuenssberg.aspx |title=ITV announces Laura Kuenssberg as Business Editor |publisher=ITN |date=22 June 2011 |accessdate=22 June 2011 |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625064345/http://corporate.itn.co.uk/about-itn/media-centre/press-release/Laura_Kuenssberg.aspx |archive-date=25 June 2011 }}</ref> On 27 August 2013, she made her debut co-newscasting ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]'' with [[Alastair Stewart]]

On 12 November 2013, it was announced that she would leave ITV to return to the BBC as chief correspondent and a presenter of ''[[Newsnight]]'', replacing [[Gavin Esler]] in the latter role. She joined the ''Newsnight'' team in February 2014.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8354077.stm Is Labour facing Glasgow upset?] BBC News, 11 November 2009</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/nov/12/bbc-newsnight-itv-laura-kuenssberg |title=BBC Newsnight recruits ITV's Laura Kuenssberg |work=The Guardian |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013 |first=John |last=Plunkett}}</ref>

Between the [[2017 United Kingdom general election]] and [[Brexit]] in 2020, Kuenssberg also co-presented the BBC's ''[[Brexitcast]]'' podcast alongside [[Katya Adler]], [[Adam Fleming (journalist)|Adam Fleming]], and [[Chris Mason (journalist)|Chris Mason]], which was then retitled as the [[Newscast (podcast)|''Newscast'']] podcast.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-01-22|title=Brexitcast to end as UK departs EU this month|url=https://radiotoday.co.uk/2020/01/brexitcast-to-end-as-uk-departs-eu-this-month/|access-date=2020-11-25|website=RadioToday|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Electioncast|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000bn8p|access-date=2020-11-26|website=[[BBC]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC One: Brexitcast|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0008cx6|access-date=2020-11-26|website=[[BBC]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC News: Newscast|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05299nl|access-date=2020-11-25|website=[[BBC]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC One: The Coronavirus Newscast|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000f2ky|access-date=2020-11-25|website=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

===BBC political editor===
She was appointed in July 2015 as the BBC's political editor, the first woman to hold the position.<ref name="dm2">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/laura-kuenssberg-political-editor |title=Laura Kuenssberg has been appointed the BBC's new Political Editor |publisher=BBC |website=BBC Media Centre |accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> In January 2016 Kuenssberg was involved in arranging for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Stephen Doughty]] to publicly announce his resignation as a shadow foreign office minister on ''Daily Politics''. The incident was the subject of an official complaint from [[Seumas Milne]], the Labour Party's director of communications, which was rejected by [[Robbie Gibb]], then the BBC's head of live political programmes.<ref name="Watt">{{cite news |title=BBC justifies decision to allow Stephen Doughty to resign live on Daily Politics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/08/bbc-justifies-decision-to-allow-stephen-doughty-to-resign-live-on-daily-politics |work=The Guardian |date=8 January 2016 |accessdate=9 January 2016 |first=Nicholas |last=Watt |first2=Mark |last2=Sweney}}</ref>

In December 2016, Kuenssberg said a source had told her that [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] had made comments supportive of leaving the [[European Union]] during a private lunch at [[Windsor Castle]]. She initially decided not to report the comments because the BBC generally requires a story to have two sources before it can run.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/26/queen-did-back-brexit-run-up-to-referendum-laura-kuenssberg |title=Laura Kuenssberg says source told her the Queen backed Brexit |last=Mason |first=Rowena |date=26 December 2016 |work=The Guardian |access-date=11 October 2019 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

During a joint press conference with the prime minister [[Theresa May]] and [[Donald Trump]], the [[president of the United States]], Kuenssberg recalled a number of controversial statements Trump made about his proposed [[Trump travel ban|travel ban]] during the [[2016 United States presidential election]], and asked Trump if he had anything to say to British viewers "worried about you becoming the [[leader of the free world]]?" Trump responded, "That's your choice of a question?" He then remarked to May: "There goes that [[Special Relationship|relationship]]."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/laura-kuenssberg-theresa-may-donald-trump-free-press-questioning-a7552056.html |title=Donald Trump says 'there goes that relationship' when asked a difficult question in press conference with Theresa May |last=Mortimer |first=Caroline |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2017-01-27}}</ref>

In March 2019, Kuenssberg presented a documentary, ''The Brexit Storm: Laura Kuenssberg's Inside Story'', for [[BBC Two]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2019/04/01/brexit-storm-laura-kuenssbergs-inside-story-review/ |title=The Brexit Storm: Laura Kuenssberg's Inside Story, review: a compelling refresher course that made its topic seem fresh |last=Power |first=Ed |date=2019-04-01 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=2019-04-02 |issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Her role in the reporting of Brexit negotiations was the subject of an article in ''The Times Magazine'' of 30 March 2019.<ref>''The Times Magazine''; 30.03.19, pp. 18-23</ref>

On 17 December 2019, she presented a second documentary film, ''The Brexit Storm Continues: Laura Kuenssberg's Inside Story'', which covered [[Boris Johnson]]'s arrival at [[10 Downing Street]] through to the 2019 general election.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/the-brexit-storm-continues-laura-kuenssberg-inside-story-a4315626.html |title=The Brexit Storm Continues: Revelations are few in Laura Kuenssberg's Inside Story |last=McKay |first=Alastair |date=17 December 2019 |website=Evening Standard |access-date=17 December 2019}}</ref>

====Bias allegations====
Following the [[2016 United Kingdom local elections|2016 local elections]], a petition was started on [[38 Degrees]] which accused Kuenssberg of being biased against the Labour Party and its leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]], calling for her dismissal.<ref>{{cite news |last=Jackson |first=Jasper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/10/bbc-laura-kuenssberg-jeremy-corbyn-petition |title=Campaign to sack BBC's Laura Kuenssberg accused of sexism |work=The Guardian|date=10 May 2016 |accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref> The petition was later withdrawn by David Babbs, executive director of 38 Degrees, who suggested it had become a "focal point for sexist and hateful abuse made towards Laura Kuenssberg" on other social media websites such as [[Twitter]] although it was acknowledged that this represented "the actions of a small minority".<ref>{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Jasper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/10/laura-kuenssberg-petition-sexist-abuse-38-degrees-bbc |title=Laura Kuenssberg petition taken down over sexist abuse |newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 May 2016 |accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=guardian-20160511>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/11/laura-kuenssberg-petition-sexist-bullies-38-degrees |title=We took down the Laura Kuenssberg petition to show sexist bullies can't win |first=David |last=Babbs |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 May 2016 |accessdate=3 June 2016}}</ref>

In January 2017 the [[BBC Trust]] ruled that a report in November 2015 by Kuenssberg broke the broadcaster's impartiality and accuracy guidelines. A viewer had complained about her item, which featured an interview with Corbyn on the ''[[BBC News at Six]]'' which gave the incorrect impression that Corbyn disagreed with the use of firearms by police in incidents such as that [[November 2015 Paris attacks|month's terrorist attacks in Paris]]. His purported answer to a question as broadcast in the report was in fact his reply to a more general question (not broadcast), and not specifically about that terrorist attack.<ref name="martinson">{{cite news|last=Martinson|first=Jane|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/18/bbc-trust-says-laura-kuenssberg-report-on-jeremy-corbyn-was-inaccurate-labour|title=BBC Trust says Laura Kuenssberg report on Corbyn was inaccurate|work=The Guardian|date=18 January 2017|accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref> The BBC Trust said that the inaccuracy was "compounded" when Kuenssberg went on to state that Corbyn's message "couldn't be more different" from that of May, who was about to publish anti-terrorism proposals. The trust said that accuracy was particularly important when dealing "with a critical question at a time of extreme national concern."<ref name="martinson"/> Nevertheless, the BBC Trust found no evidence that there had been any intention to mislead, and their ruling was that the footage "had been compiled in good faith."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Editorial Standards Findings Appeals to the Trust and other editorial issues considered by the Editorial Standards Committee|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/esc_bulletins/2017/jan.pdf|access-date=2020-09-21}}</ref> [[The Daily Telegraph|''The Daily Telegraph'']] published a story about Kunnensburg in 2017 with the headline "the most divisive woman on TV today?" printed on the front-page.<ref name="Saner"/><ref>{{Cite news|date=27 June 2017|title=Laura Kuenssberg: the most divisive woman on TV today?|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-daily-telegraph/20170627/281509341195335|access-date=2020-11-25}}</ref>

In September 2019 Kuenssberg received criticism for her portrayal of Omar Salem, a father who confronted the prime minister, [[Boris Johnson]], about the government's treatment of the [[National Health Service|NHS]], as "a Labour activist."<ref name=nationalscot-20190918>{{cite news |url=https://www.thenational.scot/news/17911630.furious-backlash-bbc-outing-father-sick-child/ |title=Furious backlash against BBC over tweet about father of sick child |date=18 September 2019 |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref> Salem defended Kuenssberg, saying that she was doing her job "without fear or favour which is a vital part of democracy.

In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election]], Kuenssberg was accused of bias, in various campaign incidents, alongside criticism of the [[BBC]]'s election coverage. On 11 December, the day before election, she drew controversy by claiming on air that submitted postal votes, apparently viewed by both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], were "looking pretty grim for Labour in a lot of parts of the country."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/2019/12/bbc-needs-social-media-bias-overhaul-laura-kuenssberg-andrew-neil-emily-maitlis|title=Why the BBC needs a social media overhaul|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/laura-kuenssberg-bbc-postal-votes-electoral-commission-a4311261.html|title=Election watchdog's warning after Kuenssberg's postal vote comments|date=11 December 2019|website=Evening Standard}}</ref> Viewing postal votes prior to polling day is in breach of guidelines set by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]]<ref name=electoralcommission-partd>{{cite report |url=https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/sites/default/files/2019-11/UKPE%20Part%20D-Absent%20voting.pdf |title=Part D - Absent voting; UK Parliamentary elections in Great Britain: guidance for (Acting) Returning Officers |publisher=Electoral Commission |date=November 2018 |access-date=11 December 2019}}</ref> and predicting electoral outcomes based on votes cast prior to polls closing may be a criminal offence.<ref name=independent-20191211>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/bbc-laura-kuenssberg-postal-votes-electoral-commission-a9242976.html |title=BBC's Laura Kuenssberg may have broken electoral law by speculating about postal votes, Electoral Commission indicates |last=Gregory |first=Andy |website=The Independent |date=11 December 2019 |access-date=11 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/2/section/66A/data.htm|title=Representation of the People Act 1983|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> The footage was subsequently withdrawn from [[BBC iPlayer]], while the episode of ''[[Politics Live]]'' in which the incident happened was withdrawn and removed from the [[BBC Parliament]] schedule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000c62v|title=BBC Two - Politics Live, 11/12/2019|website=BBC}}</ref> The BBC News press office tweeted: "Regarding today's ''Politics Live'' programme, the BBC does not believe it, or its political editor, has breached electoral law."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/bbc-laura-kuenssberg-postal-votes-electoral-commission-a9242976.html|title=Laura Kuenssberg may have broken electoral law by speculating about postal votes, Electoral Commission indicates|date=11 December 2019|website=The Independent}}</ref> The [[Metropolitan Police]] later confirmed that there was "no evidence of any criminal offences having been committed."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://evolvepolitics.com/met-police-clear-laura-kuenssberg-of-electoral-crime-after-she-revealed-postal-vote-information-during-december-election/|title=Met Police clear Laura Kuenssberg, 04/03/2020|website=Evolve Politics}}</ref>

Kuenssberg was criticised, alongside other major journalists, for incorrectly tweeting that a Labour activist had punched a Conservative Party advisor, without verification; footage was released showing this was untrue and she later apologised and retracted her tweet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://talkradio.co.uk/news/laura-kuenssberg-under-fire-punch-claim-19121032736 |title=Laura Kuenssberg under fire for 'punch' claim |website=talkradio.co.uk |access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref> On 3 March 2020, however, the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit stated that "It found no evidence of political bias nor that Laura Kuenssberg had failed to check the story before publication." In her apology, Kuenssberg noted that two sources had told her the story was true, and she hence decided to publish it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/ecu/tweet-by-laura-kuenssberg-9-december-2019|title=Tweet by Laura Kuenssberg 9 December 2019 |website=bbc.co.uk |access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>

An interview with Boris Johnson in July 2020 led to over 100 complaints against Kuenssberg being submitted to the BBC alleging that she had overly interrupted Johnson and was displaying bias against the government. The BBC defended Kuenssberg, stating that she has conducted the interview in a 'thorough, firm but fair manner.'<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/complaint/lkpminterview|title=BBC News, 24 July 2020}}</ref>

In November 2020, economists criticized Kuenssberg for economic illiteracy after she defended proposed austerity by the Tory government by claiming the UK had "no money left" and drawing a flawed comparison between a national economy and a household.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC accused of 'economic illiteracy and pushing need for Tory austerity'|url=https://www.thenational.scot/news/18898078.bbc-laura-kuenssberg-promoting-tory-austerity-economic-illiteracy/|access-date=2020-11-26|website=The National|language=en}}</ref>

====Bodyguard====
In a July 2017 ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' article, [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] wrote of being told "informally" that  Kuenssberg had received protection from a bodyguard during the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]]. The BBC had believed her safety was under threat because of online abuse considered to be mainly from supporters of Corbyn.<ref name="telegraph140717">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/14/laura-kuenssberg-given-bodyguard-general-election-campaign/|title=BBC's Laura Kuenssberg was 'given a bodyguard' during general election campaign|work=The Telegraph|date=14 July 2017|accessdate=23 July 2017}}</ref><ref name="Simpson140717">{{cite news|last=Simpson|first=Fiona|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/bbc-journalist-laura-kuessberg-given-a-bodyguard-after-abuse-by-online-trolls-during-election-a3588071.html|title=BBC journalist Laura Kuenssberg 'given a bodyguard' after abuse by online trolls during election campaign|work=London Evening Standard|date=14 July 2017|accessdate=23 July 2017}}</ref> The BBC refused to comment about the story.
