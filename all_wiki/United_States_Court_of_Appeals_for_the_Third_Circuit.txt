The '''United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit''' (in [[case citation]]s, '''3d Cir.''') is a [[United States federal court|federal court]] with [[appellate jurisdiction]] over the [[United States district court|district courts]] for the following [[United States federal judicial district|districts]]:
* [[United States District Court for the District of Delaware|District of Delaware]]
* [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey|District of New Jersey]]
* [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania|Eastern District of Pennsylvania]]
* [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania|Middle District of Pennsylvania]]
* [[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania|Western District of Pennsylvania]]

Additionally, this circuit also hears appeals from the [[District Court of the Virgin Islands]], which is technically a territorial court and not a full district court under Article III of the Constitution.

The court is composed of 14 active judges and is based at the [[James A. Byrne United States Courthouse]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The court also conducts sittings in other venues, including the [[United States Virgin Islands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/Public%20Notices/Notice_April_2013.pdf |title=Notice for Sitting in Virgin Islands |work=Official website of the Third Circuit |accessdate=March 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401083600/http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/Public%20Notices/Notice_April_2013.pdf |archive-date=April 1, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is one of thirteen [[United States courts of appeals]]. Due to the court's appellate jurisdiction over [[Delaware]] (where more than half of publicly traded companies in the United States incorporate), the court handles a significant number of influential commercial cases in the United States.
