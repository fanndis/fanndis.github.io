{{Watergate}}

The '''Watergate scandal''' was a [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|political scandal in the United States]] involving the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon#Administration|administration of U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] from 1972 to 1974 that led to Nixon's resignation. The scandal stemmed from the Nixon administration's continuous attempts to cover up its involvement in the June 17, 1972 break-in of the [[Democratic National Committee]] headquarters at the [[Washington, D.C.]] [[Watergate Office Building]]. After the five perpetrators were arrested, the press and the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] connected the cash found on them at the time to the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President|Nixon re-election campaign committee]].<ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu">{{Cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/journalism/j6075/edit/readings/watergate.html |title=Watergate Case Study |last=Perry |first=James M. |authorlink=James M.

On January 27, 1972, [[G. Gordon Liddy]], Finance Counsel for the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CRP) and former aide to [[John Ehrlichman]], presented a campaign intelligence plan to CRP's Acting Chairman [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]], Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]], and Presidential Counsel [[John Dean]] that involved extensive illegal activities against the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. According to Dean, this marked "the opening scene of the worst political scandal of the twentieth century and the beginning of the end of the Nixon presidency".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dean |first=John W. |url=https://archive.org/details/nixondefensewhat0000dean/page/ |title=The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It |date=2014 |publisher=Viking |isbn=978-0-670-02536-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/nixondefensewhat0000dean/page/ xvii]}}</ref>

Mitchell viewed the plan as unrealistic. Two months later, Mitchell approved a [[Operation Gemstone|reduced version]] of the plan, including burglarizing the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s (DNC) headquarters at the [[Watergate Complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]—ostensibly to photograph campaign documents and install listening devices in telephones. Liddy was nominally in charge of the operation,{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} but has since insisted that he was duped by both Dean and at least two of his subordinates, which included former CIA officers [[E. Howard Hunt]] and [[James W. McCord, Jr.|James McCord]], the latter of whom was serving as then-CRP Security Coordinator after John Mitchell had by then resigned as Attorney General to become the CRP chairman.<ref Name=TimeRetrospective/><ref name="nixonmitchell">{{Cite news |last=Meyer |first=Lawrence |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/stories/mitchobit.htm |title=John N.

In May, McCord assigned former FBI agent [[Alfred C.

Two phones inside the DNC headquarters' offices were said to have been [[wiretapped]].<ref name=mccordreturns /> One was [[Robert Spencer Oliver]]'s phone. At the time, Oliver was working as the executive director of the Association of State Democratic Chairmen. The other phone belonged to DNC chairman [[Larry O'Brien]]. The FBI found no evidence that O'Brien's phone was bugged;{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} however, it was determined that an effective listening device was installed in Oliver's phone. While successful with installing the listening devices, the Committee agents soon determined that they needed repairs. They plotted a second "burglary" in order to take care of the situation.<ref name="mccordreturns">{{Cite news |last=Pear |first=Robert |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/15/us/watergate-then-now-2-decades-after-political-burglary-questions-still-linger.html |title=Watergate, Then and Now – 2 Decades After a Political Burglary, the Questions Still Linger |date=June 14, 1992 |work=The New York Times |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref>

Sometime after midnight on Saturday, June 17, 1972, Watergate Complex security guard [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]] noticed tape covering the [[Latch (hardware)|latches]] on some of the complex's doors leading from the underground parking garage to several offices, which allowed the doors to close but stay unlocked.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} He removed the tape, believing it was nothing.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/12/22/the-post-and-the-forgotten-security-guard-who-discovered-the-watergate-break-in/ |title='The Post' and the forgotten security guard who discovered the Watergate break-in |last=Brown |first=DeNeen |date=2017 |website=The Washington Post}}</ref> When he returned a short time later and discovered that someone had retaped the locks, he called the police.<ref name=":0" /> Responding to the call was an unmarked car with three plainclothes officers (Sgt.

The following morning, Sunday, June 18, G.

==Cover-up and its unraveling==
===Initial cover-up===
[[File:Address Book of Watergate Burglar Bernard Barker, Discovered in a Room at the Watergate Hotel, June 18, 1972 - NARA - 304966.tif|thumb|Address book of Watergate burglar Bernard Barker, discovered in a room at the Watergate Hotel, June 18, 1972]]

Within hours of the burglars' arrests, the FBI discovered [[E. Howard Hunt]]'s name in Barker and Martínez's address books. Nixon administration officials were concerned because Hunt and Liddy were also involved in a separate secret activity known as the "[[White House Plumbers]]", which was established to stop security " [[News leak|leaks]]" and investigate other sensitive security matters. Dean later testified that top Nixon aide [[John Ehrlichman]] ordered him to "[[wikt:deep six|deep six]]" the contents of Howard Hunt's White House safe. Ehrlichman subsequently denied this. In the end, Dean and the FBI's Acting Director [[L. Patrick Gray]] (in separate operations) destroyed the evidence from Hunt's safe.

Nixon's own reaction to the break-in, at least initially, was one of skepticism. Watergate prosecutor James Neal was sure that Nixon had not known in advance of the break-in. As evidence, he cited a conversation taped on June 23 between the President and his Chief of Staff, [[H. R. Haldeman]], in which Nixon asked, "Who was the asshole that did that?"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_01.pdf |title=Transcript Of A Recording Of A Meeting Between The President And H.R. Haldeman In The Oval Office On June 23, 1972 From 10:04 To 11:39 a.m. |website=Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum}}</ref> However, Nixon subsequently ordered Haldeman to have the CIA block the FBI's investigation into the source of the funding for the burglary.

A few days later, Nixon's Press Secretary, [[Ron Ziegler]], described the event as "a third-rate burglary attempt". On August 29, at a news conference, Nixon stated that Dean had conducted a thorough investigation of the incident, when Dean had actually not conducted any investigations at all. Nixon furthermore said, "I can say categorically that&nbsp;... no one in the White House staff, no one in this Administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident." On September 15, Nixon congratulated Dean, saying, "The way you've handled it, it seems to me, has been very skillful, because you—putting your fingers in the dikes every time that leaks have sprung here and sprung there."<ref Name=TimeRetrospective/>

===Kidnapping of Martha Mitchell===
{{main|Martha Mitchell#June 1972 Kidnapping, aftermath and vindication}}

[[Martha Mitchell]] was the wife of Nixon's [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], [[John N. Mitchell]], who had recently resigned his role so that he could become campaign manager for Nixon's [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CRP). John Mitchell knew that Martha knew McCord, one of the Watergate burglars who had been arrested, and that upon finding out she was likely to speak to the media. In his opinion, her knowing McCord was likely to link the Watergate burglary to Nixon. John Mitchell instructed guards in her security detail to not let her contact the media.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Brockell|first=Gillian|title=‘I’m a political prisoner’: Mouthy Martha Mitchell was the George Conway of the Nixon era|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/03/21/im-political-prisoner-how-martha-mitchell-became-george-conway-nixon-era/|access-date=2020-11-17|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

Made out to the Finance Committee of the Committee to Reelect the President, the check was a 1972 campaign donation by [[Kenneth H. Dahlberg#Watergate|Kenneth H. Dahlberg]]. This money (and several other checks which had been lawfully donated to the CRP) had been directly used to finance the burglary and wiretapping expenses, including hardware and supplies.

Mr. Barker's multiple national and international businesses all had separate bank accounts, which he was found to have attempted to use to disguise the true origin of the money being paid to the burglars. The donor's checks demonstrated the burglars' direct link to the finance committee of the CRP.

Donations totalling $86,000 (${{Inflation|US|86000|1972|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) were made by individuals who were deluded that they were making private donations by certified and cashier's checks for the president's re-election. Investigators' examination of the bank records of a Miami company run by Watergate burglar Barker revealed an account controlled by him personally had deposited a check and then transferred it (through the [[Federal Reserve System#Check clearing system|Federal Reserve Check Clearing System]]).

The banks that had originated the checks were keen to ensure the depository institution used by Barker had acted properly in ensuring the checks had been received and endorsed by the check's payee, before its acceptance for deposit in Bernard Barker's account. Only in this way would the issuing banks not be held liable for the unauthorized and improper release of funds from their customers' accounts.

The investigation by the FBI, which cleared Barker's bank of fiduciary malfeasance, led to the direct implication of members of the CRP, to whom the checks had been delivered. Those individuals were the Committee bookkeeper and its treasurer, [[Hugh Sloan]].

As a private organization, the committee followed the normal business practice in allowing only duly authorized individuals to accept and endorse checks on behalf of the committee. No financial institution could accept or process a check on behalf of the committee unless a duly authorized individual endorsed it. The checks deposited into Barker's bank account were endorsed by Committee treasurer Hugh Sloan, who was authorized by the Finance Committee. However, once Sloan had endorsed a check made payable to the committee, he had a legal and fiduciary responsibility to see that the check was deposited only into the accounts named on the check. Sloan failed to do that. When confronted with the potential charge of federal bank fraud, he revealed that committee deputy director [[Jeb Magruder]] and finance director [[Maurice Stans]] had directed him to give the money to [[G. Gordon Liddy]].

Liddy, in turn, gave the money to Barker and attempted to hide its origin. Barker tried to disguise the funds by depositing them into accounts in banks outside of the United States. Unbeknownst to Barker, Liddy, and Sloan, the complete record of all such transactions was held for roughly six months. Barker's use of foreign banks in April and May 1972, to deposit checks and withdraw the funds via cashier's checks and money orders, resulted in the banks keeping the entire transaction records until October and November 1972.

All five Watergate burglars were directly or indirectly tied to the 1972 CRP, thus causing Judge Sirica to suspect a conspiracy involving higher-echelon government officials.<ref>Quote: "There were still simply too many unanswered questions in the case. By that time, thinking about the break-in and reading about it, I'd have had to be some kind of moron to believe that no other people were involved. No political campaign committee would turn over so much money to a man like Gordon Liddy without someone higher up in the organization approving the transaction. How could I not see that? These questions about the case were on my mind during a pretrial session in my courtroom on December 4."

On September 29, 1972, the press reported that John Mitchell, while serving as Attorney General, controlled a secret Republican fund used to finance intelligence-gathering against the Democrats. On October 10, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported that the FBI had determined that the Watergate break-in was part of a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage on behalf of the Nixon re-election committee. Despite these revelations, Nixon's campaign was never seriously jeopardized; on November 7, the [[1972 United States presidential election|President was re-elected]] in one of the biggest landslides in American political history.

===Role of the media===
The connection between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage—in particular, investigative coverage by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political and legal repercussions. Relying heavily upon [[anonymous sources]], ''Post'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into the upper reaches of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House. Woodward and Bernstein interviewed [[Judy Hoback Miller]], the bookkeeper for Nixon's re-election campaign, who revealed to them information about the mishandling of funds and records being destroyed.<ref>[http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/06/woodward-and-bernstein-downplay-deep-throat-125950.html "Woodward Downplays Deep Throat"], Politico.com blog, June 2012.

[[File:Watergate garage with historic marker.jpg|thumb|Garage in Rosslyn where Woodward and Felt met. Also visible is the historical marker erected by the county to note its significance.]]

Chief among the ''Post's'' anonymous sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant was identified as [[William Mark Felt, Sr.]], deputy director of the FBI during that period of the 1970s, something Woodward later confirmed. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt's involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded the stakes in Watergate as extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed. All the secret meetings between Woodward and Felt took place at an underground parking garage somewhere in [[Rosslyn, Virginia|Rosslyn]] over a period from June 1972 to January 1973. Prior to resigning from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also anonymously planted [[News leak|leaks]] about Watergate with [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], the ''[[Washington Daily News]]'' and other publications.<ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu" /><ref name="Holland">[http://www.pressherald.com/2012/02/19/the-profound-lies-of-deep-throat_2012-02-19/ "The profound lies of Deep Throat"], ''The Miami Herald'', republished in Portland Press Herald, February 14, 2012</ref>

During this early period, most of the media failed to understand the full implications of the scandal, and concentrated reporting on other topics related to the 1972 presidential election.<ref name="TimeWatergateCoverage">{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943934-1,00.html |title=Covering Watergate: Success and Backlash |date=July 8, 1974 |work=Time |access-date=July 24, 2011}}</ref> Most outlets ignored or downplayed Woodward and Bernstein's scoops; the crosstown ''[[Washington Star-News]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' even ran stories incorrectly discrediting the ''Post's'' articles. After the ''Post'' revealed that [[H.R. Haldeman]] made payments from the secret fund, newspapers like the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' failed to publish the information, but did publish the White House's denial of the story the following day.<ref name="BoysontheBus">Crouse, Timothy (1973).''The Boys on the Bus'', Random House, p. 298</ref> The White House also sought to isolate the ''Post's'' coverage by tirelessly attacking that newspaper while declining to criticize other damaging stories about the scandal from the [[New York Times]] and [[Time Magazine]].<ref name="BoysontheBus" /><ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu" />

After it was learned that one of the convicted burglars wrote to Judge Sirica alleging a high-level cover-up, the media shifted its focus. ''Time'' magazine described Nixon as undergoing "daily hell and very little trust". The distrust between the press and the Nixon administration was mutual and greater than usual due to lingering dissatisfaction with events from the [[Vietnam War]]. At the same time, public distrust of the media was polled at more than 40%.<ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage />

Nixon and top administration officials discussed using government agencies to "get" (or retaliate against) those they perceived as hostile media organizations.<ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /> Such actions had been taken before. At the request of Nixon's White House in 1969, the FBI tapped the phones of five reporters. In 1971, the White House requested an audit of the tax return of the editor of ''[[Newsday]]'', after he wrote a series of articles about the financial dealings of [[Charles Rebozo|Charles "Bebe" Rebozo]], a friend of Nixon.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911434-3,00.html |title=The Nation: More Evidence: Huge Case for Judgment |date=July 29, 1974 |work=Time |access-date=July 24, 2011}}</ref>

The Administration and its supporters accused the media of making "wild accusations", putting too much emphasis on the story, and of having a liberal bias against the Administration.<ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu" /><ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /> Nixon said in a May 1974 interview with supporter [[Baruch Korff]] that if he had followed the liberal policies that he thought the media preferred, "Watergate would have been a blip."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942981-11,00.html |title=The Nixon Years: Down from the Mountaintop |date=August 19, 1974 |work=Time |access-date=July 24, 2011}}</ref> The media noted that most of the reporting turned out to be accurate; the competitive nature of the media guaranteed widespread coverage of the far-reaching political scandal.<ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage />

===Scandal escalates===
Rather than ending with the conviction and sentencing to prison of the five Watergate burglars on January 30, 1973, the investigation into the break-in and the Nixon Administration's involvement grew broader. "Nixon's conversations in late March and all of April 1973 revealed that not only did he know he needed to remove Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean to gain distance from them, but he had to do so in a way that was least likely to incriminate him and his presidency. Nixon created a new conspiracy—to effect a cover-up of the cover-up—which began in late March 1973 and became fully formed in May and June 1973, operating until his presidency ended on August 9, 1974."<ref>Dean, John W. (2014). ''The Nixon Defense'', p. 344, Penguin Group, {{ISBN|978-0-670-02536-7}}</ref> On March 23, 1973, Judge Sirica read the court a letter from Watergate burglar [[James W. McCord Jr.|James McCord]], who alleged that [[perjury]] had been committed in the Watergate trial, and defendants had been pressured to remain silent. In an attempt to make them talk, Sirica gave Hunt and two burglars provisional sentences of up to 40 years.

Urged by Nixon, on March 28, aide John Ehrlichman told Attorney General [[Richard Kleindienst]] that nobody in the White House had prior knowledge of the burglary. On April 13, Magruder told U.S. attorneys that he had perjured himself during the burglars' trial, and implicated John Dean and John Mitchell.<ref Name=TimeRetrospective/>

John Dean believed that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman could go to the prosecutors, tell the truth, and save the presidency. Dean wanted to protect the president and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president's depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean felt that he was being recorded. He wondered if this was due to the way Nixon was speaking, as if he were trying to prod attendees' recollections of earlier conversations about fundraising. Dean mentioned this observation while testifying to the Senate Committee on Watergate, exposing the thread of what were taped conversations that would unravel the fabric of the conspiracy.<ref>Dean, John W. (2014). ''The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It'', pp. 415–416, Penguin Group, {{ISBN|978-0-670-02536-7}}</ref>

Two days later, Dean told Nixon that he had been cooperating with the [[U.S. attorneys]]. On that same day, U.S. attorneys told Nixon that Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Dean, and other White House officials were implicated in the cover-up.<ref Name=TimeRetrospective/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 In Review. |date=September 8, 1973 |access-date=June 17, 2010 |agency=United Press International}}</ref><ref>"When Judge Sirica finished reading the letter, the courtroom exploded with excitement and reporters ran to the rear entrance to phone their newspapers. The bailiff kept banging for silence. It was a stunning development, exactly what I had been waiting for. Perjury at the trial. The involvement of others. It looked as if Watergate was about to break wide open."

On April 30, Nixon asked for the resignation of Haldeman and Ehrlichman, two of his most influential aides. They were both later indicted, convicted, and ultimately sentenced to prison. He asked for the resignation of Attorney General Kleindienst, to ensure no one could claim that his innocent friendship with Haldeman and Ehrlichman could be construed as a conflict. He fired [[White House Counsel]] John Dean, who went on to testify before the [[Senate Watergate Committee]] and said that he believed and suspected the conversations in the Oval Office were being taped. This information became the bombshell that helped force Richard Nixon to resign rather than be impeached.<ref>Dean, John W. (2014). ''The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It'', pp. 610–620, Penguin Group, {{ISBN|978-0-670-02536-7}}</ref>

Writing from prison for ''New West'' and ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazines in 1977, Ehrlichman claimed Nixon had offered him a large sum of money, which he declined.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918947-2,00.html "Sequels: Nixon: Once More, with Feeling"], ''Time'', May 16, 1977</ref>

The President announced the resignations in an address to the American people:

{{quote|In one of the most difficult decisions of my Presidency, I accepted the resignations of two of my closest associates in the White House, Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, two of the finest public servants it has been my privilege to know. Because Attorney General Kleindienst, though a distinguished public servant, my personal friend for 20 years, with no personal involvement whatsoever in this matter has been a close personal and professional associate of some of those who are involved in this case, he and I both felt that it was also necessary to name a new Attorney General. The [[Counsel to the President]], John Dean, has also resigned.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 in Review |date=September 8, 1973 |access-date=June 17, 2010 |agency=United Press International}}</ref>}}

On the same day, April 30, Nixon appointed a new attorney general, [[Elliot Richardson]], and gave him authority to designate a special counsel for the Watergate investigation who would be independent of the regular [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] hierarchy. In May 1973, Richardson named [[Archibald Cox]] to the position.<ref Name=TimeRetrospective/>

On Friday, July 13, during a preliminary interview, deputy minority counsel [[Donald Sanders]] asked White House assistant [[Alexander Butterfield]] if there was any type of recording system in the White House.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kranish |first=Michael |url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/07/04/not_all_would_put_a_heroic_sheen_on_thompsons_watergate_role/?page=2 |title=Select Chronology for Donald G.

On Monday, July 16, in front of a live, televised audience, chief minority counsel [[Fred Thompson]] asked Butterfield whether he was "aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president". Butterfield's revelation of the taping system transformed the Watergate investigation. Cox immediately subpoenaed the tapes, as did the Senate, but Nixon refused to release them, citing his [[executive privilege]] as president, and ordered Cox to drop his subpoena. Cox refused.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 In Review |date=September 8, 1973 |access-date=June 17, 2010 |agency=United Press International}}</ref>

On October 20, 1973, after Cox refused to drop the subpoena, Nixon ordered Attorney General [[Elliot Richardson]] to fire the special prosecutor. Richardson resigned in protest rather than carry out the order. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General [[William Ruckelshaus]] to fire Cox, but Ruckelshaus also resigned rather than fire him. Nixon's search for someone in the Justice Department willing to fire Cox ended with the [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] [[Robert Bork]]. Though Bork said he believed Nixon's order was valid and appropriate, he considered resigning to avoid being "perceived as a man who did the President's bidding to save my job".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Noble |first=Kenneth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/bork-irked-by-emphasis-on-his-role-in-watergate.html |title=Bork Irked by Emphasis on His Role in Watergate |date=July 2, 1987 |work=The New York Times |access-date=May 26, 2009}}</ref> Bork carried out the presidential order and dismissed the special prosecutor.

===Legal action against Nixon Administration members===
On March 1, 1974, a [[grand jury]] in Washington, D.C., indicted several former aides of Nixon, who became known as the "[[Watergate Seven]]"—[[H. R. Haldeman]], [[John Ehrlichman]], [[John N. Mitchell]], [[Charles Colson]], [[Gordon C. Strachan]], [[Robert Mardian]], and [[Kenneth Parkinson]]—for conspiring to hinder the Watergate investigation. The grand jury secretly named Nixon as an [[unindicted co-conspirator]]. The special prosecutor dissuaded them from an indictment of Nixon, arguing that a President can be indicted only after he leaves office.<ref name="TimeLegal">{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942980,00.html |title=The Legal Aftermath Citizen Nixon and the Law |date=August 19, 1974 |work=Time |access-date=July 24, 2011}}</ref> John Dean, [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]], and other figures had already pleaded guilty.

Two days later, the same grand jury indicted [[Ed Reinecke]], the Republican [[Lieutenant Governor of California]], on three charges of perjury before the Senate committee.

===Release of the transcripts===
[[File:Nixon E2679c-09A.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|President Nixon explaining release of edited transcripts, April 29, 1974]]

The Nixon administration struggled to decide what materials to release. All parties involved agreed that all pertinent information should be released. Whether to release unedited [[profanity]] and vulgarity divided his advisers. His legal team favored releasing the tapes unedited, while Press Secretary [[Ron Ziegler]] preferred using an edited version where "[[expletive deleted]]" would replace the raw material. After several weeks of debate, they decided to release an edited version. Nixon announced the release of the transcripts in a speech to the nation on April 29, 1974. Nixon noted that any audio pertinent to national security information could be [[redaction|redacted]] from the released tapes.<ref>Theodore White. ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1370091&referer=brief_results Breach of Faith: The Fall of Richard Nixon]''. Readers Digest Press, Athineum Publishers, 1975, pp. 296–298</ref>

Initially, Nixon gained a positive reaction for his speech. As people read the transcripts over the next couple of weeks, however, former supporters among the public, media and political community called for Nixon's resignation or impeachment. Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] said, "While it may be easy to delete characterization from the printed page, we cannot delete characterization from people's minds with a wave of the hand."<ref name=woodward/> The Senate Republican Leader [[Hugh Scott]] said the transcripts revealed a "deplorable, disgusting, shabby, and immoral" performance on the part of the President and his former aides.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1994-07-26/news/2994945_1_mr-scott-white-house-hugh-scott |title=Obituary: Hugh Scott, A Dedicated Public Servant |date=July 26, 1994 |work=The Morning Call |access-date=December 8, 2015}}</ref> The House Republican Leader [[John Jacob Rhodes]] agreed with Scott, and Rhodes recommended that if Nixon's position continued to deteriorate, he "ought to consider resigning as a possible option".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&d=stanford19740510-01.2.43# |title=GOP Leaders Favour Stepdown |date=May 10, 1974 |work=The Stanford Daily |access-date=December 8, 2015 |agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

The editors of ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'', a newspaper that had supported Nixon, wrote, "He is humorless to the point of being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane.

===Supreme Court===
The issue of access to the tapes went to the United States Supreme Court. On July 24, 1974, in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', the Court ruled unanimously (8–0) that claims of executive privilege over the tapes were void. (Then-Justice [[William Rehnquist]]—who had recently been appointed to the Court by Nixon and most recently served in the Nixon Justice Department as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel—recused himself from the case.) The Court ordered the President to release the tapes to the special prosecutor. On July 30, 1974, Nixon complied with the order and released the subpoenaed tapes to the public.

===Release of the tapes===
The tapes revealed several crucial conversations<ref>Kutler, S. (1997). ''Abuse of Power'', p. 247. Simon & Schuster.</ref> that took place between the president and his counsel, John Dean, on March&nbsp;21, 1973. In this conversation, Dean summarized many aspects of the Watergate case, and focused on the subsequent cover-up, describing it as a "cancer on the presidency". The burglary team was being paid [[hush money]] for their silence and Dean stated: "That's the most troublesome post-thing, because Bob [Haldeman] is involved in that; John [Ehrlichman] is involved in that; I am involved in that; Mitchell is involved in that. And that's an obstruction of justice." Dean continued, saying that Howard Hunt was blackmailing the White House demanding money immediately. Nixon replied that the money should be paid: "...&nbsp; just looking at the immediate problem, don't you have to have—handle Hunt's financial situation damn soon?&nbsp;... you've got to keep the cap on the bottle that much, in order to have any options".<ref name="nixonlibrary.gov">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/wspf/886-008.pdf |title=Transcript Prepared by the Impeachment Inquiry Staff for the House Judiciary Committee of a Recording of a Meeting Among the President, John Dean and H.R.

At the time of the initial congressional proceedings, it was not known if Nixon had known and approved of the payments to the Watergate defendants earlier than this conversation. Nixon's conversation with Haldeman on August&nbsp;1, is one of several that establishes he did. Nixon said: "Well&nbsp;... they have to be paid. That's all there is to that. They have to be paid."<ref>Kutler, S. (1997). ''Abuse of Power'', p. 111.

New York: Simon & Schuster.</ref>

On December 7, investigators found that an [[18½ minute gap|{{frac|18|1|2}}-minute portion]] of one recorded tape had been erased. [[Rose Mary Woods]], Nixon's longtime personal secretary, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her tape player when answering the phone. The press ran photos of the set-up, showing that it was unlikely for Woods to answer the phone while keeping her foot on the pedal. Later [[forensic]] analysis in 2003 determined that the tape had been erased in several segments—at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Clymer |first=Adam |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/09/us/national-archives-has-given-up-on-filling-the-nixon-tape-gap.html |title=National Archives Has Given Up on Filling the Nixon Tape Gap |date=May 9, 2003 |work=The New York Times |access-date=January 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527231832/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/09/us/national-archives-has-given-up-on-filling-the-nixon-tape-gap.html |archive-date=May 27, 2015}}</ref>

On August 5, 1974, the White House released a previously unknown audio tape from June 23, 1972. Recorded only a few days after the break-in, it documented the initial stages of the cover-up: it revealed Nixon and Haldeman had conducted a meeting in the Oval Office during which they discussed how to stop the FBI from continuing its investigation of the break-in, as they recognized that there was a high risk that their position in the scandal may be revealed.

Haldeman introduced the topic as follows:

<blockquote>...{{nbsp}}the Democratic break-in thing, we're back to the—in the, the problem area because the FBI is not under control, because [[L. Patrick Gray|Gray]] doesn't exactly know how to control them, and they have&nbsp;... their investigation is now leading into some productive areas&nbsp;... and it goes in some directions we don't want it to go.<ref name="haldeman6.23.72" /></blockquote>
[[File:Members and staff of House Judiciary Committee 1974.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|House Judiciary Committee members and staff, 1974]]

After explaining how the money from CRP was traced to the burglars, Haldeman explained to Nixon the cover-up plan: "the way to handle this now is for us to have Walters [CIA] call Pat Gray [FBI] and just say, 'Stay the hell out of this&nbsp;... this is ah, business here we don't want you to go any further on it.'"<ref name="haldeman6.23.72" />

Nixon approved the plan, and after he was given more information about the involvement of his campaign in the break-in, he told Haldeman: "All right, fine, I understand it all. We won't second-guess Mitchell and the rest." Returning to the use of the CIA to obstruct the FBI, he instructed Haldeman: "You call them in. Good. Good deal. Play it tough. That's the way they play it and that's the way we are going to play it."<ref name="haldeman6.23.72">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/wspf/741-002.pdf |title="Transcript of a Recording of a Meeting Between the President and H.R.

Nixon denied that this constituted an obstruction of justice, as his instructions ultimately resulted in the CIA truthfully reporting to the FBI that there were no national security issues. Nixon urged the FBI to press forward with the investigation when they expressed concern about interference.<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=4320&st=&st1= Statement Announcing Availability of Additional Transcripts of Presidential Tape Recordings] August 5, 1974</ref>

Before the release of this tape, Nixon had denied any involvement in the scandal. He claimed that there were no political motivations in his instructions to the CIA, and claimed he had no knowledge before March 21, 1973, of involvement by senior campaign officials such as [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]]. The contents of this tape persuaded Nixon's own lawyers, [[Fred Buzhardt]] and [[James D. St. Clair|James St. Clair]], that "the President had lied to the nation, to his closest aides, and to his own lawyers—for more than two years".<ref>Bernstein and Woodward (1976): ''The Final Days'', p. 309</ref> The tape, which [[Barber Conable]] referred to as a "[[Nixon White House tapes#The "smoking gun" tape|smoking gun]]", proved that Nixon had been involved in the cover-up from the beginning.

In the week before Nixon's resignation, Ehrlichman and Haldeman tried unsuccessfully to get Nixon to grant them pardons—which he had promised them before their April 1973 resignations.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908732-8,00.html |title=The Administration: The Fallout from Ford's Rush to Pardon |date=September 23, 1974 |work=Time |access-date=July 24, 2011}}</ref>

The release of the [[Nixon White House tapes#The "smoking gun" tape|"smoking gun" tape]] destroyed Nixon politically. The ten congressmen who had voted against all three articles of impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee announced they would all support the impeachment article accusing Nixon of obstructing justice when the articles came up before the full House.<ref name="graham">Katharine Graham, ''Personal History'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1997), p. 495.</ref> Additionally, Rhodes, the House leader of Nixon's party, announced that he would vote to impeach, stating that "coverup of criminal activity and misuse of federal agencies can neither be condoned nor tolerated".<ref name="RhodesObit">{{Cite news |last=Bart Barnes |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/john-j-rhodes-dies-led-gop-in-house-during-watergate/2012/06/05/gJQA84nSGV_story.html |title=John J.

On the night of August 7, 1974, Senators [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Hugh Scott]] and Congressman Rhodes met with Nixon in the Oval Office. Scott and Rhodes were the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, respectively; Goldwater was brought along as an elder statesman. The three lawmakers told Nixon that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain impeachment when the articles came up for vote in the full House; indeed, by one estimate, no more than 75 representatives were willing to oppose impeachment.<ref name=RhodesObit/> Goldwater and Scott told the president that there were enough votes in the Senate to convict him, and that no more than 15 Senators were willing to vote for acquittal–not even half of the 34 votes he needed to stay in office.

Faced with the inevitability of his impeachment and removal from office and that [[public opinion]] was not in his favor, Nixon decided to resign.<ref name="schmidt">{{Citation |last=Schmidt |first=Steffen W. |title=American Government and Politics Today, 2013–2014 Edition |page=181 |year=2013 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing |isbn=978-1133602132 |quote=In 1974, President Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of a scandal when it was obvious that public opinion no longer supported him. |author-link=Steffen Schmidt}}</ref> In a [[s:Richard Nixon's resignation speech|nationally televised address]] from the Oval Office on the evening of August 8, 1974, the president said, in part:

{{quote|In all the decisions I have made in my public life, I have always tried to do what was best for the Nation. Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me. In the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort. As long as there was such a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future.

...&nbsp;I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to do so. But the interest of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations. From the discussions I have had with Congressional and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the Nation would require.

...&nbsp;''I have never been a quitter''. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as President, I must put the interest of America first. America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress, particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad. To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home. Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/links/nixon_speech.html |title=President Nixon's Resignation Speech |access-date=August 29, 2009 |website=PBS}}</ref>}}

The morning that his resignation took effect, the President, with Mrs. Nixon and their family, said farewell to the White House staff in the [[East Room]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Brokaw, Tom |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5593631 |title=Politicians come and go, but rule of law endures |date=August 6, 2004 |work=NBC News |access-date=August 29, 2009}}</ref> A helicopter carried them from the White House to [[Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland|Andrews Air Force Base]] in [[Maryland]]. Nixon later wrote that he thought, "As the helicopter moved on to Andrews, I found myself thinking not of the past, but of the future. What could I do now?" At Andrews, he and his family boarded an Air Force plane to [[El Toro Marine Corps Air Station]] in California, and then were transported to his home [[La Casa Pacifica]] in [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]].

With Nixon's resignation, Congress dropped its impeachment proceedings. Criminal prosecution was still a possibility at the federal level.<ref name=TimeLegal/> Nixon was [[Inauguration of Gerald Ford|succeeded by]] Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] as President, who on September 8, 1974, issued a full and unconditional [[pardon]] of Nixon, immunizing him from prosecution for any crimes he had "committed or may have committed or taken part in" as president.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/LIBRARY/speeches/740061.htm |title=Gerald Ford's Proclamation Granting a Pardon to Richard Nixon |website=Ford.utexas.edu |access-date=June 17, 2010}}</ref> In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interest of the country. He said that the Nixon family's situation "is an American tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it.

Nixon continued to proclaim his innocence until his death in 1994. In his official response to the pardon, he said that he "was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Fulton |first=Mary Lou |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-17/news/ss-339_1_richard-nixon/2 |title=Nixon Library : Nixon Timeline |date=July 17, 1990 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=July 28, 2014 |page=2}}</ref>

Some commentators have argued that pardoning Nixon contributed to President Ford's loss of the [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1976]].<ref name="shanescott">{{Cite news |last=Shane |first=Scott |title=For Ford, Pardon Decision Was Always Clear-Cut |date=December 29, 2006 |work=The New York Times |page=A1}}</ref> Allegations of a secret deal made with Ford, promising a pardon in return for Nixon's resignation, led Ford to testify before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] on October 17, 1974.<ref name="Gettlin, Robert; Colodny, Len 1991 420">{{Cite book |last1=Gettlin, Robert |url=https://archive.org/details/silentcoupremova00colo/page/420 |title=Silent Coup: The Removal of a President |last2=Colodny, Len |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-312-05156-5 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/silentcoupremova00colo/page/420 420] |oclc=22493143}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Ford, Gerald R. |title=A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald R.

In his autobiography ''A Time to Heal'', Ford wrote about a meeting he had with Nixon's Chief of Staff, [[Alexander Haig]]. Haig was explaining what he and Nixon's staff thought were Nixon's only options. He could try to ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process, to try to settle for a censure vote in Congress, or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon's staff suggested that Nixon could agree to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him.

{{quote|Haig emphasized that these weren't ''his'' suggestions. He didn't identify the staff members and he made it very clear that he wasn't recommending any one option over another. What he wanted to know was whether or not my overall assessment of the situation agreed with his. [emphasis in original]&nbsp;... Next he asked if I had any suggestions as to courses of actions for the President. I didn't think it would be proper for me to make any recommendations at all, and I told him so.|[[Gerald Ford]], ''A Time to Heal''<ref>Ford (1979), 4.</ref>}}

==Aftermath==
===Final legal actions and effect on the law profession===
[[Charles Colson]] pled guilty to charges concerning the [[Daniel Ellsberg#Fielding break-in|Daniel Ellsberg]] case; in exchange, the indictment against him for covering up the activities of the [[Committee to Re-elect the President]] was dropped, as it was against Strachan. The remaining five members of the Watergate Seven indicted in March went on trial in October 1974. On January 1, 1975, all but Parkinson were found guilty. In 1976, the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered a new trial for Mardian; subsequently, all charges against him were dropped.

Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Mitchell exhausted their appeals in 1977. Ehrlichman entered prison in 1976, followed by the other two in 1977. Since Nixon and many senior officials involved in Watergate were lawyers, the scandal severely tarnished the public image of the legal profession.<ref>Anita L.

To defuse public demand for direct federal regulation of lawyers (as opposed to leaving it in the hands of state [[bar associations]] or courts), the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) launched two major reforms. First, the ABA decided that its existing [[American Bar Association Model Code of Professional Responsibility|Model Code of Professional Responsibility]] (promulgated 1969) was a failure. In 1983 it replaced it with the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]].<ref>Theodore Schneyer, "Professionalism as Politics: The Making of a Modern Legal Ethics Code", in ''Lawyers' Ideals/Lawyers' Practices: Transformations in the American Legal Profession'', eds.

Its preamble contains an emphatic reminder that the legal profession can remain self-governing only if lawyers behave properly. Second, the ABA promulgated a requirement that law students at ABA-approved [[law school]]s take a course in [[professional responsibility]] (which means they must study the MRPC). The requirement remains in effect.<ref>{{Cite book |last=American Bar Association |title=ABA Standards and Rules of Procedure for Approval of Law Schools 2015–2016 |date=2015 |publisher=American Bar Association |isbn=978-1-63425-352-9 |location=Chicago |page=16 |chapter=Standard 303, Curriculum |access-date=December 15, 2016 |chapter-url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/misc/legal_education/Standards/2015_2016_aba_standards_for_approval_of_law_schools_final.authcheckdam.pdf}}</ref>

On June 24 and 25, 1975, Nixon gave secret testimony to a [[grand jury]]. According to news reports at the time, Nixon answered questions about the {{frac|18|1|2}}-minute tape gap, altering White House tape transcripts turned over to the House Judiciary Committee, using the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to harass political enemies, and a $100,000 contribution from billionaire [[Howard Hughes]]. Aided by the [[Public Citizen Litigation Group]], the historian [[Stanley Kutler]], who has written several books about Nixon and Watergate and had successfully sued for the 1996 public release of the [[Nixon White House tapes]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/20004 |title=Historian's work gives a glimpse of Nixon "unplugged" |date=November 8, 2011 |website=University of Wisconsin-Madison |access-date=September 30, 2014}}</ref> sued for release of the transcripts of the Nixon grand jury testimony.<ref name=Secret/>

On July 29, 2011, U.S. District Judge [[Royce Lamberth]] granted Kutler's request, saying historical interests trumped privacy, especially considering that Nixon and other key figures were deceased, and most of the surviving figures had testified under oath, have been written about, or were interviewed.

===Political and cultural reverberations===
According to Thomas J. Johnson, a professor of journalism at [[University of Texas at Austin]], Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] predicted during Nixon's final days that history would remember Nixon as a great president and that Watergate would be relegated to a "minor footnote".<ref>Thomas J. Johnson, ''Watergate and the Resignation of Richard Nixon: Impact of a Constitutional Crisis'', "The Rehabilitation of Richard Nixon", eds. P. Jeffrey and Thomas Maxwell-Long: Washington, D.C., CO. Press, 2004, pp. 148–149.</ref>

When Congress investigated the scope of the president's legal powers, it belatedly found that consecutive presidential administrations had declared the United States to be in a continuous open-ended [[state of emergency]] since 1950. Congress enacted the [[National Emergencies Act]] in 1976 to regulate such declarations. The Watergate scandal left such an impression on the national and international consciousness that many scandals since then have been labeled with the "[[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|-gate suffix]]".
[[File:1976 campaign button f.JPG|thumb|One of a variety of anti-Ford [[Pin-back button|buttons]] generated during the 1976 presidential election: it reads "Gerald&nbsp;... Pardon me!" and depicts a thief cracking a safe labeled "Watergate".]]

Disgust with the revelations about Watergate, the Republican Party, and Nixon strongly affected results of the [[1974 United States Senate elections|November 1974 Senate]] and [[1974 United States House of Representatives elections|House elections]], which took place three months after Nixon's resignation. The Democrats gained five seats in the Senate and forty-nine in the House (the newcomers were nicknamed "[[Watergate Babies]]"). Congress passed legislation that changed [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign financing]], to amend the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], as well as to require financial disclosures by key government officials (via the [[Ethics in Government Act]]). Other types of disclosures, such as releasing recent income tax forms, became expected, though not legally required. Presidents since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had recorded many of their conversations but the practice purportedly ended after Watergate.

Ford's pardon of Nixon played a major role in his defeat in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]] against [[Jimmy Carter]].<ref name="shanescott" />

In 1977, Nixon arranged [[The Nixon Interviews|an interview]] with British journalist [[David Frost]] in the hope of improving his legacy. Based on a previous interview in 1968,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,947901-2,00.html |title=The Nation: David Can Be a Goliath |date=May 9, 1977 |work=Time}}</ref> he believed that Frost would be an easy interviewer and was taken aback by Frost's incisive questions. The interview displayed the entire scandal to the American people, and Nixon formally apologized, but his legacy remained tarnished.<ref name="NYTimes David Frost">{{Cite news |last=Stelter |first=Brian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/world/europe/david-frost-known-for-nixon-interview-dead-at-74.html |title=David Frost, Interviewer Who Got Nixon to Apologize for Watergate, Dies at 74 |date=September 1, 2013 |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 25, 2014}}</ref> The 2008 movie ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]'' is a media depiction of this.

In the aftermath of Watergate, "[[follow the money]]" became part of the American lexicon and is widely believed to have been uttered by Mark Felt to Woodward and Bernstein. The phrase was never used in the 1974 book ''[[All the President's Men]]'' and did not become associated with it until the [[All the President's Men (film)|movie of the same name]] was released in 1976.<ref>"Follow The Money: On The Trail Of Watergate Lore", NPR, June 16, 2012</ref> The 2017 movie ''[[Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House]]'' is about Felt's role in the Watergate scandal and his identity as Deep Throat.

The parking garage where Woodward and Felt met in Rosslyn still stands. Its significance was noted by Arlington County with a historical marker in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.arlnow.com/2011/08/17/historical-marker-installed-outside-deep-throat-garage/ |title=Historical Marker Installed Outside 'Deep Throat' Garage |date=August 17, 2011 |access-date=January 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=55498 |title=Watergate Investigation Historical Marker |access-date=January 23, 2018}}</ref> In 2017 it was announced that the garage would be demolished as part of construction of an apartment building on the site; the developers announced that the site's significance would be memorialized within the new complex.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/parking-garage-where-deep-throat-spilled-beans-watergate-being-torn-down-180961733/ |title=The Parking Garage Where Deep Throat Spilled the Beans on Watergate Is Being Torn Down |last=Lewis |first=Danny |access-date=January 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Maher |first=Kris |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/watergate-parking-garage-to-be-torn-down-1402874716 |title=Watergate Parking Garage to Be Torn Down |date=June 20, 2014 |work=Wall Street Journal |access-date=January 23, 2018 |via=www.wsj.com}}</ref>

==Purpose of the break-in==
Despite the enormous impact of the Watergate scandal, the purpose of the break-in of the DNC offices has never been conclusively established. Records from the ''United States v. Liddy'' trial, made public in 2013, showed that four of the five burglars testified that they were told the campaign operation hoped to find evidence that linked Cuban funding to Democratic campaigns.<ref name="baldwinlist">{{Cite news |last=Jessica Gresko, Associated Press |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/16/watergate-records_n_3606339.html |title=Watergate Records Released 40 Years After Being Filed Under Seal |date=July 16, 2013 |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=September 6, 2014}}</ref> The longtime hypothesis suggests that the target of the break-in was the offices of [[Larry O'Brien]], the DNC Chairman.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}<ref>{{Cite news |last=Greenberg |first=David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/weekinreview/05green.html |title=The Unsolved Mysteries of Watergate |date=June 5, 2005 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> However, O'Brien's name was not on Alfred C. Baldwin III's list of targets that was released in 2013.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Among those listed were senior DNC official [[R. Spencer Oliver]], Oliver's secretary Ida "Maxine" Wells, co-worker Robert Allen and secretary Barbara Kennedy.<ref name=baldwinlist />

Based on these revelations, [[Texas A&M]] history professor Luke Nichter, who had successfully petitioned for the release of the information,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/sites/dcd/files/12-mc-74_memorandum_opinion.pdf |title=In Re: Petition of Luke Nitcher |last=Senior Judge Royce Lamberth |date=June 11, 2013 |website=United States District Court for the District of Columbia |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195819/http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/sites/dcd/files/12-mc-74_memorandum_opinion.pdf |archive-date=September 10, 2014 |access-date=September 9, 2014}}</ref> argued that Woodward and Bernstein were incorrect in concluding, based largely on Watergate burglar James McCord's word, that the purpose of the break-in was to bug O'Brien's phone to gather political and financial intelligence on the Democrats.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Instead, Nichter sided with late journalist [[J. Anthony Lukas]] of ''The New York Times'', who had concluded that the committee was seeking to find evidence linking the Democrats to prostitution, as it was alleged that Oliver's office had been used to arrange such meetings. However, Nichter acknowledged that Woodward and Bernstein's theory of O'Brien as the target could not be debunked unless information was released about what Baldwin heard in his bugging of conversations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1968, O'Brien was appointed by Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] to serve as the national director of Humphrey's presidential campaign and, separately, by [[Howard Hughes]] to serve as Hughes' public-policy lobbyist in Washington. O'Brien was elected national chairman of the DNC in 1968 and 1970. In late 1971, the president's brother, [[Donald Nixon]], was collecting intelligence for his brother at the time and asked [[John H. Meier]], an adviser to Howard Hughes, about O'Brien. In 1956, Donald Nixon had borrowed $205,000 from Howard Hughes and had never repaid the loan. The loan's existence surfaced during the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]] campaign, embarrassing Richard Nixon and becoming a political liability. According to author Donald M. Bartlett, Richard Nixon would do whatever was necessary to prevent another family embarrassment.<ref>Donald L. Bartlett, ''Howard Hughes'', p. 410, W. W. Norton & Co., 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-393-32602-4}}</ref> From 1968 to 1970, Hughes withdrew nearly half a million dollars from the Texas National Bank of Commerce for contributions to both Democrats and Republicans, including presidential candidates Humphrey and Nixon. Hughes wanted Donald Nixon and Meier involved but Nixon opposed this.<ref>Charles Higham ''Howard Hughes'', p. 244, Macmillan, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-312-32997-6}}</ref>

Meier told Donald that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because they had considerable information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Hughes that had never been released, and that it resided with Larry O'Brien.<ref>DuBois, Larry, and Laurence Gonzales (September 1976). "Hughes, Nixon and the C.I.A.: The Watergate Conspiracy Woodward and Bernstein Missed", ''Playboy''</ref> According to Fred Emery, O'Brien had been a lobbyist for Hughes in a Democrat-controlled Congress, and the possibility of his finding out about Hughes' illegal contributions to the Nixon campaign was too much of a danger for Nixon to ignore.<ref>Fred Emery ''Watergate'', p. 30, Simon & Schuster, 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-684-81323-3}}</ref>

[[James F. Neal]], who prosecuted the Watergate 7, did not believe Nixon had ordered the break-in because of Nixon's surprised reaction when he was told about it.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917056,00.html |title=The Nation: It Goes Back to the Big Man Time Magazine January 13, 1975 issue |date=January 13, 1975 |work=Time |access-date=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

When one reporter suggested that Nixon and his position with Brezhnev were "weakened" by the scandal, Brezhnev replied, "It does not enter my mind to think whether Mr. Nixon has lost or gained any influence because of the affair." Then he said further that he had respected Nixon because of Nixon's "realistic and constructive approach to [[Soviet Union–United States relations]]&nbsp;... passing from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiations between nations".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XTkoAAAAIBAJ&pg=7434%2C4352706 |title=Brezhnev to Shun Talk of Watergate |date=June 15, 1973 |work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |access-date=November 23, 2014 |at=Part 1, page 3 |via=Google News Archive}}</ref>

Talks between Nixon and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Edward Heath]] may have been bugged. Heath did not publicly display his anger, with aides saying that he was unconcerned about having been bugged at the White House. According to officials, Heath commonly had notes taken of his public discussions with Nixon so a recording would not have bothered him. However, officials privately said that if private talks with Nixon were bugged, then Heath would be outraged.
