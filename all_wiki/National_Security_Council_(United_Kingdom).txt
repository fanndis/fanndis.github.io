The '''National Security Council''' ('''NSC''') of the [[United Kingdom]] is a [[United Kingdom cabinet committee|Cabinet Committee]] tasked with overseeing all issues related to [[national security]], intelligence coordination, and defence strategy. The terms of reference of the National Security Council are to consider matters relating to national security, [[foreign policy]], [[National security|defence]], cyber security, resilience, energy and resource security.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/national-security-council |title = National Security Council}}</ref>

== History ==
The National Security Council was established on 12 May 2010 by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]. The NSC formalised national security decision making, which had previously been carried out in informal groups largely composed of officials. It increased the power of the Prime Minister, who chairs the Council, and brought senior Cabinet ministers into national security policy making, giving them access to the highest levels of intelligence.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/david-cameron-made-the-huawei-leak-possible-national-security/|title=David Cameron made the Huawei leak possible|last=Snell|first=Arthur|date=2019-04-27|website=POLITICO|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> It reflects the central coordination of national security issues seen in the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]],<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/national-security-council|title=The National Security Council: national security at the centre of government|journal=The Institute for Government|author=Dr Joe Devanny & Josh Harris|publisher=Institute for Government & King's College London|accessdate=6 November 2014|date=2014-11-04}}</ref> which operated from 1902 until 1947, while also being partly modelled on the [[United States National Security Council]].<ref name=":0" />

The Council is a Cabinet committee; it coordinates responses to threats faced by the United Kingdom and integrates at the highest level the work of relevant government entities with respect to national security.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://number10.gov.uk/news/establishment-of-a-national-security-council/ |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130109092234/http://number10.gov.uk/news/establishment-of-a-national-security-council/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 January 2013 |title=Press Notice: Establishment of a National Security Council |publisher=Prime Minister's Office |date=12 May 2010}}</ref> The UK's [[National Security Advisor (United Kingdom)|National Security Adviser]] (NSA) is secretary to the council. The NSA role is currently held by Sir [[Mark Sedwill]], who commenced work as the UK's fourth NSA in April 2017. In October 2018, Sedwill became [[Cabinet Secretary]] and it was subsequently reported that he would be expected to combine the NSA role with his new responsibilities as [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)]] and [[Head of the Home Civil Service]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ft.com/content/67a01004-307d-11e9-8744-e7016697f225/ |title= Head of UK civil service confirms permanent dual role |author=James Blitz |publisher=Financial Times |date=14 February 2019}}</ref> However, as of July 2019, he retains dual appointments.

From 1 April 2015 the council oversaw the newly created [[Conflict, Stability and Security Fund]], a fund of more than £1 billion per year for tackling conflict and instability abroad.<ref name=parliament-20160526>{{cite web |url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/news-parliament-2015/cssf-launch-16-17/ |title=Conflict, Stability and Security Fund inquiry launched |publisher=UK Parliament |work=Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy |date=26 May 2016 |accessdate=26 November 2016}}</ref> Following a critical inquiry into the fund by the [[Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy]] in 2016,<ref name=parliament-20160526>{{cite web |url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/news-parliament-2015/cssf-launch-16-17/ |title=Conflict, Stability and Security Fund inquiry launched |publisher=UK Parliament |work=Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy |date=26 May 2016 |accessdate=26 November 2016}}</ref> where the committee stated that the fund was secretive and "There is a risk that the CSSF is being used as a ‘slush fund’ [for projects that do not] meet the needs of UK national security", fund spending at the country level was disclosed and an annual report produced.<ref name=guardian-20170306>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/06/amber-rudd-secret-billion-pound-conflict-stability-security-fund |title=Amber Rudd asked to reveal where secret £1bn conflict fund is spent |last=Travis |first=Alan |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 March 2017 |accessdate=12 June 2017}}</ref>

In April 2019, an inquiry, which could lead to criminal proceedings, was announced into the leaking to the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' of a decision by the NSC to allow [[Huawei]] to bid for 'non-core' elements of the construction of the prospective [[5G network]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48059724|title=Huawei row: Inquiry to be held into National Security Council leak|date=25 April 2019|accessdate=26 April 2019|work=BBC News}}</ref>

The council met weekly during the administrations of [[Premiership of David Cameron|David Cameron]] and [[Premiership of Theresa May|Theresa May]], but meets very infrequently under Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] and not at all during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name=guardian-20200512>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/12/uk-national-security-council-has-not-met-since-january |title=UK national security council has not met since January |last=Sabbagh |first=Dan |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 May 2020 |access-date=12 May 2020}}</ref>
