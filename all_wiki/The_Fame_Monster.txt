'''''The Fame Monster''''' is a [[reissue]] of American singer [[Lady Gaga]]'s debut studio album, ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008), and was released on November 18, 2009, through [[Interscope Records]]. Initially planned solely as a deluxe edition reissue of ''The Fame'', Interscope later decided to release the eight new songs as a standalone [[extended play|EP]] in some territories. The decision was also because Gaga believed the re-release was too expensive and that the albums were conceptually different, describing them as [[yin and yang]]. The deluxe edition is a [[double album]] featuring the eight new songs on the first disc and ''The Fame'' on the second disc. A super deluxe edition released on December 15, 2009 holds additional merchandise, including a lock from Gaga's wig.

A [[Pop music|pop]] record, ''The Fame Monster'' has influences of [[disco]], [[glam rock]], and [[synthpop]] music of the [[1970s in music|1970s]] and [[1980s in music|1980s]], as well as [[Industrial music|industrial]] and [[Gothic rock|gothic music]]. The album was also inspired by fashion shows and runways. According to Gaga, the album deals with the darker side of [[Celebrity|fame]], with its theme lyrically expressed through a [[Paranoia|monster]] metaphor. The cover artwork, shot by [[Hedi Slimane]], has a [[Goth subculture|Gothic]] theme and was declined for release by her record company, but Gaga persuaded them.

''The Fame Monster'' received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album charted as ''The Fame'' in some countries, and topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Poland, and Switzerland. In the United States, the EP reached number five on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and topped the [[Dance/Electronic Albums]] chart. The album has won [[List of awards and nominations received by Lady Gaga|multiple awards]] since its release. It was nominated in a total of six categories at the [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]], including Gaga's second consecutive [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] nomination. It won three, including [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]].

"[[Bad Romance]]", the album's [[lead single]], was a commercial success, topping the charts in more than twenty countries and reaching number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the US. The next two [[single (music)|singles]], "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]" and "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]", reached the top ten in multiple countries worldwide. "[[Dance in the Dark]]" was released as a single only in select territories, achieving moderate chart success. To promote the album, Gaga embarked on [[The Monster Ball Tour]] (2009–2011), which became the highest-grossing tour in history by a debut headlining artist.

==Background and development==
Gaga released her debut studio album, ''[[The Fame]]'', in 2008. Consisting of [[electropop]] and [[synthpop]] songs, the album offered a commentary on fame, duality between celebrity and fan base, as well as wealthy person's life. After the worldwide success of ''The Fame'', the idea of a re-release arose.<ref name="criticalessay"/> However, Gaga felt that re-releases were a disservice to music artists because "it's artists sneaking singles onto an already finished piece of work in an effort to keep the album afloat." Her label, [[Interscope Records]], initially wanted three songs for the project, titled as ''The Fame Monster''. Gaga had already composed a song, "[[Monster (Lady Gaga song)|Monster]]", by March 2009.<ref name="head">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-unleashes-monster-with-dr-dre-headphones-first-song-next-singer-on-new-tracks-20091001|title=Lady Gaga Unleashes "Monster" With Dr. Dre: Headphones First, Song Next?|last=Carpenter|first=Ellen|date=October 1, 2009|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=March 23, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404024558/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-unleashes-monster-with-dr-dre-headphones-first-song-next-singer-on-new-tracks-20091001|archivedate=April 4, 2015}}</ref> She sought for a darker and edgier concept than she had previously done,<ref name="dicho">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1626823/lady-gaga-gets-dark-on-the-fame-monster/|title=Lady Gaga Gets 'Dark' On ''The Fame Monster''|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=November 23, 2009|last2=Calloway|first2=Sway|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=November 24, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216151153/http://www.mtv.com/news/1626823/lady-gaga-gets-dark-on-the-fame-monster/|archivedate=February 16, 2015}}</ref> and cited her love of [[horror film]]s and "the decay of the celebrity and the way that fame is a monster in society" as creative inspirations for ''The Fame Monster''.<ref name="firstlady">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267214/lady-gaga-first-lady|title=Lady Gaga: First Lady|last=Harding|first=Cortney|date=October 1, 2009|accessdate=October 8, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524033654/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267214/lady-gaga-first-lady|archivedate=May 24, 2013}}</ref> Gaga explained in an interview with ''[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]'':
<blockquote>
I have an obsession with death and sex. Those two things are also the nexus of horror films, which I've been obsessing over lately. I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies. My re-release is called ''The Fame Monster'' so I've just been sort of bulimically eating and regurgitating monster movies and all things scary. I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but in a very real way. If you notice in those films, there's always a juxtaposition of sex with death.<ref name="criticalessay"/>
</blockquote>
Unlike her debut album, the new record was inspired by the singer's personal experiences.<ref name="criticalessay">{{cite book|title=The Performance Identities of Lady Gaga: Critical Essays|last=Gray II|first=Richard|year=2012|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|isbn=9780786492527|page=5}}</ref> The early musical direction was also shaped by Gaga's touring experiences with [[The Fame Ball Tour]], during which she allegedly encountered "several monsters" that encapsulated her biggest fears. These fears were divided into various monster metaphors, such as the "Fear of Sex Monster", "Fear of Love Monster", "Fear of Alcohol Monster", and so forth. "I spent a lot of nights in Eastern Europe," the singer said. "And this album is a pop experimentation with industrial/Goth beats, 90's dance melodies, an obsession with the lyrical genius of 80's melancholic pop, and the runway".<ref name="finance">{{cite press release|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lady-gaga-returns-with-8-new-songs-on-the-fame-monster-63780227.html|title=Lady Gaga Returns With 8 New Songs on ''The Fame Monster''|date=October 8, 2009|work=[[PR Newswire]]|accessdate=October 9, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011005910/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lady-gaga-returns-with-8-new-songs-on-the-fame-monster-63780227.html|archivedate=October 11, 2009}}</ref> In an interview with [[MTV News]], Gaga said that ''The Fame'' and ''The Fame Monster'' were like [[yin and yang]] because of their contrasting styles and concepts.<ref name="dicho" />

''The Fame Monster'' begins with the track "[[Bad Romance]]", which Simon Price from ''[[The Independent]]'' felt set the tone for the album.

Gaga confirmed that the eight new songs would be released in North America as a standalone [[extended play]] (EP).

With the release of ''The Fame'' and ''The Fame Monster'', Gaga revived electronic dance music during the late 2000s on radio. Jonathan Bogart from ''[[The Atlantic]]'' stated, "EDM came in by no back door but right through the front gate, with Lady Gaga's "Just Dance" in 2008" and that "the sound didn't take long to spread".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/buy-the-hype-why-electronic-dance-music-really-could-be-the-new-rock/259597/|first=Jonathan|last=Bogart|title=Buy the Hype: Why Electronic Dance Music Really Could Be the New Rock|date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=January 2, 2018|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217180548/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/buy-the-hype-why-electronic-dance-music-really-could-be-the-new-rock/259597/|archivedate=February 17, 2016}}</ref> DJ [[Tommie Sunshine]] told [[MTV]] that "there wouldn't be a [[David Guetta]] top 10 hit... there wouldn't be this [[The Black Eyed Peas|Black Eyed Peas]] [[The E.N.D.|record]], if it wasn't for ''The Fame''.

Andrew Unterberger of ''Billboard'' stated that "Gaga raised the standards for ambition in pop." Unterberger said that "it didn't take long for Lady Gaga to prove that she was the asteroid pop music was begging to have crash through it." He further stated that "other pop stars have picked up the slack", concluding that Gaga "took American mainstream music at one of its least-interesting and most star-power-deprived moments and made it bigger, weirder, more visual and infinitely more personality-driven – in other words, much more fun."<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Unterberger, Andrew|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7548935/lady-gaga-pop-ambition-kanye-beyonce|title=How Lady Gaga Raised the Standards for Ambition in Pop|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=January 23, 2018|date=October 18, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704013753/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7548935/lady-gaga-pop-ambition-kanye-beyonce|archivedate=July 4, 2017}}</ref>

Critics acknowledged that with ''The Fame Monster'', Gaga started a trend in pop music with wearing bizarre and outrageous outfits. [[New York Post#Page Six|Page Six]]'s Jarett Wieselman stated: "I've repeatedly hypothesized that the success and adoration bestowed upon Lady Gaga has led every female celebrity to assume that whether or not she cultivates a quirky personality, her options for fashion forwardness are limitless!" He also said that "the 'Lady Gaga' effect persists".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pagesix.com/2010/02/22/the-lady-gaga-effect-persists/|title=The 'Lady GaGa' effect persists|date=February 22, 2010|publisher=[[New York Post#Page Six|Page Six]]|accessdate=January 23, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916182708/http://pagesix.com/2010/02/22/the-lady-gaga-effect-persists/|archivedate=September 16, 2017}}</ref> Tracie Egan Morrissey from [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]], said that [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]]'s red carpet "reeks of Lady Gaga's influence" and that "ever since Lady Gaga came on the scene with her bizarre masks, tall hats and concept outfits, everyone thinks looking like an idiot on the red carpet is a sign of artistic integrity." She continues: "[[Nicki Minaj]] has a horrible case of Gaga-itis" and that [[Katy Perry]]'s "cube on her head is totally her attempt at being avant fashion-y."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/5835339/lady-gagas-influence-can-be-seen-all-over-vma-red-carpet/|title=The Red Carpet Reeks Of Lady Gaga's Influence|first=Tracie Egan|last=Morrissey|website=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]|accessdate=January 23, 2018|date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

Jon Caramanica from ''[[The New York Times]]'' in his article "Girl Pop’s Lady Gaga Makeover" states: "It's Halloween-costume empowerment, sure, but her fingerprints are all over the revised images of [[Christina Aguilera]], Rihanna, Katy Perry and Beyoncé; and on new artists like [[Kesha]], [[Janelle Monáe]] and Nicki Minaj" and that "the work she’s done since her 2008 debut album [...] has nudged loose conventional boundaries." He then continued by saying that "If Lady Gaga has had direct impact on anyone, it's been, most surprisingly, Beyoncé, who has spent the majority of her career impervious to influence from her peers. Yet in the last year, in the wake of a pair of collaborations with Lady Gaga — "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]" and "[[Video Phone (song)|Video Phone]]" — she appears to have come alive. The videos for those songs showed her to be far more humorous than ever before" and "it’s as if Lady Gaga swooped in and infected Beyoncé with a bug, a vampiric chain of events."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Caramanica|first1=Jon|title=Girl Pop’s Lady Gaga Makeover|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/arts/music/25feminism.html?mcubz=0|accessdate=January 25, 2018|work=The New York Times|date=July 21, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916225240/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/arts/music/25feminism.html?mcubz=0|archivedate=September 16, 2017}}</ref>
