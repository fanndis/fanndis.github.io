'''Inmaculada Concepción "Conchita" Martínez Bernat''' (born 16 April 1972) is a former professional [[tennis]] player. She was the first Spanish player to win the women's singles title at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], where she beat [[Martina Navratilova]] in the [[1994 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|1994 final]]. Martínez also was the singles runner-up at the [[1998 Australian Open]] and the [[2000 French Open]]. She reached a highest world ranking of No. 2 in October 1995 and finished the season in the Top 10 for nine years. Martínez won 33 singles and 13 doubles titles during her 18-year career, as well as three Olympic medals.

A five-time winner of the [[Fed Cup]] as a player, Martínez was the [[Spain Fed Cup team|Spanish Fed Cup team]] captain from 2013 to 2017 and the [[Spain Davis Cup team|Spanish Davis Cup team]] captain from 2015 to 2017, leading the Davis Cup team back into the top-tier World Group under her captaincy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Conchita Martinez lashes out at Spanish tennis bosses after firing|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2017/09/martinez-fired-from-spains-fed-cup-and-davis-cup-teams/69415/|publisher=Tennis.com|date=14 September 2017}}</ref> She has also served as a part-time coach to [[Garbiñe Muguruza]], guiding her to the [[2017 Wimbledon]] title, and was the full-time coach to [[Karolína Plíšková]] through 2018 and 2019. She began coaching Muguruza on a full-time basis in 2020.

==Career==
===1988–1992: Breakthrough, Top 10, Grand Slam quarterfinals===
Born in [[Monzón]], Martínez turned professional in 1988.  At the age of just 16, she reached the fourth round at the [[French Open]] in her third professional tournament.  She upset ninth-seed [[Lori McNeil]] en route before losing to [[Bettina Fulco]] in two sets.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roig|first1=Alex Martínez|title=Conchita Martínez desdramatiza su crisis y se clasifica para los octavos de final|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1989/06/03/deportes/612828009_850215.html|publisher=[[El Pais]]|language=Spanish|date=3 June 1989|quote=El año pasado, en su primera aparición en esta competición, también llegó a los octavos, en los que perdió con la argentina Bettina Fulco.}}</ref> In 1989, her breakthrough year, Martínez got rid of [[Gabriela Sabatini|Sabatini]] to win the title at [[1989 Eckerd Open|Tampa]] and also won two Tier V tournaments ([[Wellington Classic|Wellington]], [[Virginia Slims of Arizona|Phoenix]]).  She also reached the quarterfinals of the French Open, losing to [[Steffi Graf]].  She finished the year World No. 7.  In 1990 and 1991, Martínez won a further six titles and again reached the quarterfinals at the French Open both years (losing to Graf in 1990 and [[Monica Seles]] in 1991).

The following year, Martínez was a silver medalist in doubles at the [[Olympic Games]] in [[Barcelona]] (partnering [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]]) and the runner-up in women's doubles at the French Open.<ref name=r1>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200417101815/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ma/conchita-martinez-1.html Conchita Martínez]. sports-reference.com</ref> Once again, Martínez was a quarterfinalist at the French Open, losing a tight match with Sabatini. In 1992 she was runner up in Indian Wells and San Diego.

===1993–1996: Highest ranking, Wimbledon singles title===
In 1993, Martínez became the first Spanish woman since [[Lilí de Álvarez]] in 1928 to reach the semifinals at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], where she lost to [[Steffi Graf]] in two sets. In November Martínez defeated Graf for the first and only time in her career, at a tournament in [[Advanta Championships of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] in the final. At the [[1993 Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]], Martínez defeated Sabatini in the final in straight sets to become the first Spaniard to win the tournament since de Álvarez in 1930.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shulman|first1=Ken|title=Martinez Knows She'll Always Have Rome|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/10/sports/tennis-martinez-knows-she-ll-always-have-rome.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 May 1993}}</ref> She again reached the quarterfinals at the French Open for the fifth year in a row, losing a 2-hour, 45-minute three-set battle with [[Anke Huber]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Crary|first1=David|title=Huber upsets Martinez in reaching semifinals|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cClJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ngYNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3484%2C75033|work=The Hour|agency=AP|date=1 June 1993}}</ref>

Martínez reached the [[1994 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] singles final in 1994 beating [[Rene Simpson]], [[Nana Smith]], [[Nathalie Tauziat]], [[Kristine Kunce]] and [[Lindsay Davenport]] in the quarterfinal and Lori McNeil in the semifinals where the third set went to 10–8, where she faced nine-time Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova. Navratilova's last Wimbledon triumph had come four years earlier, but many observers felt that the 37-year-old Czech-born American was the favourite going into the match given her long track record of success on [[grass court]]s, whereas Martínez's most significant tournament victories up to that time had been on slower-playing surfaces, particularly on [[clay court]]s. Martínez, however, won the match in three sets and became the first Spanish woman to win Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shapiro|first1=Leonard|title=Martinez foils Navratilova's final Wimbledon shot|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1994/07/03/martinez-foils-navratilovas-final-wimbledon-shot/428e6187-ccba-4678-a3d4-b35a7d42d61c/|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=3 July 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Classic Matches: Martinez v Navratilova|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742085.stm|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=31 May 2004}}</ref> In 1995, Martínez was a semifinalist at all four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments and reached her career-high singles ranking of World No. 2. In the [[Australian Open]] she beat Lindsay Davenport in the quarterfinals before losing to [[Mary Pierce]] in the semifinals. At [[1995 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Martínez beat Sabatini in the quarterfinals before losing to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the semifinals. She also had a new coach that year, [[Carlos Kirmayr]].

In 1996, Martínez became the only player to win the [[1996 Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]] singles title four consecutive years after a straight-sets victory in the final against 15-year-old [[Martina Hingis]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Bud|authorlink1=Bud Collins|title=Martinez Ends Hingis' Magical Run|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-05-13/sports/sp-3632_1_martina-hingis|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=13 May 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Conchita triunfa en Roma|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1996/05/13/deportes/831938409_850215.html|publisher=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|date=13 May 1996}}</ref> She also partnered Sánchez Vicario to claim a women's doubles [[Tennis at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Women's doubles|Olympic bronze medal in Atlanta]].<ref name=r1/>

On 15 April 2006, aged 33 and after 18 years of playing professionally, she announced her retirement, having won more professional singles tournaments than any other Spanish female tennis player.<ref>{{cite web|title=Martinez announces her retirement|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SPORT/04/15/tennis.martinez/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=15 April 2006}}</ref><ref name="espn">{{cite web|last1=DeSimone|first1=Bonnie|title=Conchita Martinez stood the test of time|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2536220|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=9 August 2006}}</ref>

==Playing style==
Nicknamed Senorita Topspin, Martínez was a patient, right-handed baseline player who won matches by disrupting her opponents' rhythm through changes of spin, pace, depth, height, and angle. She had a strong backhand, played single-handedly, and used heavy topspin on her forehand and slower topspin and slice on her backhand.<ref name=wot2001>{{cite book|title=[[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] World of Tennis 2001|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=9780007111299|editor=[[John Barrett (tennis)|John Barrett]]|pages=346–349}}</ref><ref name=collins>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Bud|authorlink=Bud Collins|title=The Bud Collins History of Tennis|year=2010|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=[New York]|isbn=978-0942257700|page=699|edition=2nd}}</ref> A characteristic shot of Martínez was to hit a deep, looping forehand with a lot of topspin with the intent to drive her opponent to the back of the court and make them hit the ball at shoulder height.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hodgkinson|first1=Mark|title=Game, Set and Match: Secret Weapons of the World's Top Tennis Players|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Sport|location=London|isbn=978-1472905772|page=32}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=20 Conchita Martinez|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/3723505.stm|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=19 May 2004}}</ref>
She often sought out the ball with which she had won the previous point. This sometimes irritated her opponents; [[Patty Schnyder]] once pocketed the ball to prevent Martínez from retrieving it, and rejected the traditional handshake at the end of the match.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clarey|first1=Christopher|title=Strange Habits of Successful Tennis Players|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/21/sports/tennis/21tennis.html?ref=sports|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 June 2008}}</ref>
