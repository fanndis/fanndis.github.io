'''Latin honors''' are [[Latin]] phrases used in some [[college]]s and [[universities]] to indicate the level of distinction with which an [[academic degree]] has been earned.  This system is primarily used in the [[United States]]. It is also used in some Southeastern Asian countries with European colonial history, such as [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]], although sometimes translations of these phrases are used instead of the Latin originals. The honors distinction should not be confused with the [[honors degree]]s offered in some countries, or with [[honorary degree]]s.

The system usually has three levels of honor: ''cum laude'', ''magna cum laude'', and ''summa cum laude''. Generally, a college or university's regulations set out definite criteria a student must meet to obtain a given honor. For example, the student might be required to achieve a specific grade point average, submit an honors thesis for evaluation, be part of an [[Honors colleges and programs|honors program]], or graduate early. Each university sets its own standards. Since these standards vary, the same level of Latin honors conferred by different institutions can represent different levels of achievement. Similarly, some institutions grant equivalent (or additional) non-Latin honors to undergraduates. The [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], for example, has a series of plain English grading honors based on class standing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://registrar.wisc.edu/grading_honors.htm | title = Grading Honors | work = [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], Office of the Registrar | publisher = University of Wisconsin System | date = January 7, 2017 | access-date = January 12, 2017}}</ref>

These honors, when they are used, are almost always awarded to [[undergraduate]]s earning their bachelor's, and, with the exception of law school graduates, much more rarely to [[graduate school|graduate]] students receiving their [[master's degree|master's]] or [[doctorate]] degree. The honor is typically indicated on the [[diploma]]. Latin honors are often conferred upon law school students graduating as a [[Juris Doctor]] or J.D., in which case they are generally based upon [[class rank]] or [[grade point average]].

====Distinctions====
In the United States, Latin honors are used by colleges and universities for undergraduate degrees (such as [[Bachelor of Arts]] or [[Bachelor of Science]]) and for the [[Juris Doctor]] law degree. They are generally not used for any other degrees, such as [[master's degrees]] or the [[Ph.D.]] and [[M.D.]] degrees. There are three main levels of Latin honors, listed below in ascending order:
*''[[Wiktionary:cum laude|cum laude]]'' ({{IPAc-en|k|uː|m|_|ˈ|l|aʊ|d|eɪ}}), meaning "with praise", typically awarded to graduates in the top 20%, 25%, or 30% of their class, depending on the institution.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nyu.edu/life/resources-and-services/nyu-studentlink/registration-records-and-graduation/graduation-and-diplomas/graduation-honors.html | title = Graduation Honors | work = NYU | publisher = New York University | quote = Effective with the September 2008 graduating class,... the GPA cutoffs for each category are determined by the combined GPA distribution from the preceding academic year, all graduation moments included.

*{{anchor|magna cum laude}}''[[Wiktionary:magna cum laude|magna cum laude]]'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|g|n|ə}}), meaning "with great praise", typically awarded to graduates in the top 10% or 15% of their class, depending on the institution.
*''[[Wiktionary:summa cum laude|summa cum laude]]'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|uː|m|ə}}), meaning "with highest praise", typically awarded to graduates in the top 1%, 2%, or 5% of their class, depending on the institution. Some institutions do not award the ''summa cum laude'' distinction or else only award it in extraordinary circumstances.

====History====
In 1869, [[Harvard College]] became the first college in the United States to award final honors to its graduates. From 1872 to 1879, ''cum laude'' and ''summa cum laude'' were the two Latin honors awarded to graduates. Beginning in 1880, ''magna cum laude'' was also awarded:

{{quote|The Faculty then prepared regulations for recommending candidates for the Bachelor's degree, either for an ordinary degree or for a degree with distinction; the grades of distinction being ''summa cum laude'', ''magna cum laude'', and ''cum laude''. The degree ''summa cum laude'' is for those who have attained ninety percent on the general scale, or have received Highest Honors in any department, and carries with it the assignment of an oration on the list of Commencement parts; the degree ''magna cum laude'' is for those who have attained eighty percent on the general scale, or have received Honors in any department, and carries with it the assignment of a dissertation; and the degree ''cum laude'' is to be given to those who attain seventy-five percent on the general scale, and to those who receive Honorable Mention in any study together with sixty-five percent on the general scale, or seventy percent on the last three years, or seventy-five percent on the last two.|Annual Reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College, 1877–78}}

In his 1895 history of [[Amherst College]], college historian [[William Seymour Tyler]] traced Amherst's system of Latin honors to 1881, and attributed it to Amherst College President [[Julius Hawley Seelye]]:

{{poemquote|Instead of attempting to fix the rank of every individual student by minute divisions on a scale of a hundred as formerly, five grades of scholarship were established and degrees were conferred upon the graduating classes according to their grades. If a student was found to be in the first or lowest grade, he was not considered as a candidate for a degree, though he might receive a certificate stating the facts in regard to his standing; if he appeared in the second grade the degree of A.B. was conferred upon him ''rite;'' if in the third, ''cum laude''; if in the fourth, ''magna cum laude''; while if he reached the fifth grade he received the degree ''summa cum laude''. The advantages of this course, as stated to the trustees by the president, are that it properly discriminates between those who, though passing over the same course of study, have done it with great differences of merit and of scholarship, and that it furnishes a healthy incentive to the best work without exciting an excessive spirit of emulation.

The new system of administration, of which the above is a part, is so original and peculiar that it is known as the Amherst System.|''A History of Amherst College During the Administrations of Its First Five Presidents, from 1821 to 1891''<ref name=Amherst>{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www3.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/amherst/history/1894tyler-ws/chapter11/menu.html | chapter = 11: The Burning of Walker Hall—The Buildings Erected During the Administration—The 'Amherst System'—Amherst College Reaches Its Highest Prosperity—Resignation of President Seelye | title =A History of Amherst College During the Administrations of Its First Five Presidents, from 1821 to 1891 | first = William S. | last = Tyler | author-link = William Seymour Tyler| location = New York | publisher = Frederick H.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[Education in the UK|UK]] the Latin ''cum laude'' is used in commemorative Latin versions of degree certificates conferred by a few universities (e.g. the [[University of Edinburgh]]) to denote a bachelor's degree '''with Honours''', but the honors classification is stated as in English, e.g. ''Primi Ordinis'' for First Class rather than ''summa cum laude'', etc.  Official degree certificates use English.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.registry.ed.ac.uk/Graduations/Latin.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615011549/http://www.registry.ed.ac.uk/Graduations/Latin.htm |archive-date=June 15, 2007 |title=Latin Versions of Degree Parchments | work = The University of Edinburgh Registry | publisher = [[University of Edinburgh]]}}</ref>

==Other countries==
For undergraduate degrees, Latin honors are used in only a few countries such as [[Education in Israel|Israel]], [[Education in Indonesia|Indonesia]], the [[Education in the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], the [[Education in the Philippines|Philippines]] and [[Education in Canada|Canada]]. Most countries use a different scheme, such as the [[British undergraduate degree classification]] (usually used in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries) which is more widely used with varying criteria and nomenclature depending on country, including [[Tertiary education in Australia|Australia]], [[Education in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[Education in Barbados|Barbados]], [[Education in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Education in Colombia|Colombia]], [[Education in Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Higher education in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Education in India|India]], [[Education in the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Education in Jamaica|Jamaica]], [[Education in Kenya|Kenya]], [[Education in New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Education in Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[Education in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Education in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Education in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], [[Education in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Education in Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Education in Uganda|Uganda]], the [[Education in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Education in Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]] and many other countries. [[Malta]] shows the Latin honors on the degree certificates, but the UK model is shown on the transcript.

=== Austria ===
In [[Education in Austria|Austria]], the only Latin honor in use is ''[[sub auspiciis Praesidentis]] rei publicae'' (''under the auspices of the president of the republic'') for doctoral degrees. Candidates must have consistently excellent grades throughout high school and university, making it very difficult to attain: only about 20 out of a total of 2,500 doctoral graduates per year (i.e. 0.8%) achieve a ''sub auspiciis'' degree.

=== Belgium ===
In [[Education in Belgium|Belgium]], the university degree awarded is limited to:<ref>https://www.kuleuven.be/onderwijs/onderwijslexicon/onderwijslexicon-g/graad-van-verdienste</ref>

* ''cum fructu'' <68% (''satisfaction'' in French, ''op voldoende wijze'' in Dutch) 
* ''cum laude'' >68% (''avec distinction'' in French, ''met onderscheiding'' in Dutch)
* ''magna cum laude'' >75% (''avec grande distinction'' in French, ''met grote onderscheiding'' in Dutch)
* ''summa cum laude'' >82,5% (''avec la plus grande distinction'' in French, ''met grootste onderscheiding'' in Dutch)

=== Brazil ===
In [[Education in Brazil|Brazil]], most universities do not provide honors to their students. Among the few universities that do so, the [[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica]] (ITA—Technological Institute of Aeronautics) awards the ''cum laude'' honor for graduates with every individual grade above 8.5 (out of 10.0), the ''magna cum laude'' honor for graduates with average grade above 8.5 and more than 50% of individual grades above 9.5, and the ''summa cum laude'' honor for graduates with average grade above 9.5. As of 2009, only 22 graduates have received the ''summa cum laude'' honor at ITA. The [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] awards the ''cum laude'' honor for graduates with average grade from 8.0 to 8.9, the ''magna cum laude'' honor for graduates with average grade from 9.0 to 9.4, and the ''summa cum laude'' honor for graduates with average grade from 9.5 to 10.0. The [[Federal University of Ceará]] awards the ''magna cum laude'' honor for undergraduates who have never failed a course, achieved an average grade from 8.5 (out of 10.0) and have received a fellowship of both ''Academic Extension'' and ''Teaching Initiation''.

=== Estonia ===
In [[Estonia]], up until 2010 both ''summa cum laude'' and ''cum laude'' were used. ''Summa cum laude'' was awarded only for very exceptional work. Since 1 September 2010, only ''cum laude'' is used. It is awarded to bachelors, masters and integrated studies graduates. Occasionally the word ''kiitusega'', which means "with praise", is substituted for the usual ''cum laude''. To receive ''cum laude'' one must achieve a 4.60 GPA (out of 5) and receive the highest grade (A - 5.00) for the thesis or the final examination.<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/13230393 | title = Ühtne hindamissüsteem kõrgharidustasemel, koos diplomi kiitusega (cum laude) andmise tingimustega | language = et | trans-title = A unified evaluation system of higher education: conditions for granting a diploma with honors (cum laude) | publisher = Minister of Education and Science | date = September 1, 2010 | accessdate = January 12, 2017}}</ref>

=== Finland ===
The [[Education in Finland|Finnish]] [[Matriculation Examination]]s at the end of [[lukio]]/[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] uses the grades of:
''improbatur'' (I, failing; "not accepted"), ''approbatur'' (A; "accepted") ''lubenter approbatur'' (B; "willingly accepted"), ''cum laude approbatur'' (C; "accepted with praise"), ''magna cum laude approbatur'' (M; "accepted with great praise"), ''eximia cum laude approbatur'' (E; "accepted with excellent praise") and ''[[laudatur]]'' (L; "praised"). They are roughly equivalent to Finnish school grades ranging from 4 to 10. Some Finnish universities, when grading master's theses and doctoral dissertations, use the same scale with the additional grade of ''non sine laude approbatur'' (N; "accepted not without praise") between ''lubenter'' and ''cum laude''; technical universities use a numerical scale (1-5) instead.

=== France ===
In [[Education in France|France]], usually the French honors ''très honorable avec félicitations du jury'', ''très honorable'' and ''honorable'' are used. However some [[Grande école|Grandes Écoles]], like the [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris]], [[HEC Paris]], use the Latin and English titles ''"summa cum laude" / "graduated with highest honors"'' for the top 2% and ''"cum laude" / "graduated with honors"'' for the next 5% of a year. Since 2016, honorifics ceased to be used for the completion of a [[PhD]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Arrêté du 25 mai 2016 fixant le cadre national de la formation et les modalités conduisant à la délivrance du diplôme national de doctorat|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000032587086|accessdate=2018-03-16}}</ref>

=== Germany ===
In [[Education in Germany|Germany]], the range of degrees is: ''rite'' ("duly" conferred, that is, the requirements are fulfilled), ''cum laude'' (with honors), ''magna cum laude'' (with great honors), and ''summa cum laude'' (with highest honors). These degrees are mostly used when a doctorate is conferred, not for diplomas, bachelor's or master's degrees, for which numerical grades between 1.0 ("very good") and 4.0 ("pass"), and 5.0 ("fail"), are given.

=== Hungary ===
In [[Education in Hungary|Hungary]], the range of degrees&nbsp;— similar to the German system&nbsp;— is: ''rite'' ("duly" conferred, that is, the requirements are fulfilled), ''cum laude'' (with honors), ''summa cum laude'' (with highest honors). These degrees are used in university diplomas and in certain fields of sciences (medical, legal and a very few others) only. The grades of degrees are dependent on the received average points from final exams and from average points from the university studies.

=== Italy ===
In [[Education in Italy|Italy]], the ''cum laude'' notation (''"con lode"'' being the equivalent in [[Italian language|Italian]]) is used as an increasing level of the highest grade for both exams (30/30) and degrees (110/110), in all its levels; 
Passing an exam cum laude (30 e lode) has usually only an honorific meaning, but sometimes it influences the average grade and can be useful to the student so honored (usually weighting 31/30).
"30 e lode" is usually awarded after answering correctly a bonus difficult question at the oral examination.

In Italy "''110 e lode''" (at institutions using a 110-point system) is the highest rank that can be achieved during the academic studies, and corresponds usually to a final score greater or equal to 112/110. Up to 3 bonus points can be awarded for merits, e.g. having an average exams score greater than 28.5/30 (95% equivalent), excellent final project or for graduating on time.
More notations include   : ''bacio e abbraccio accademico'' ("academic kiss and embrace") ''menzione d'onore'' ("honor mention") and ''dignità di stampa'' ("dignity of printing"), and were given based on various University-specific requirements, but without a legal value.

=== Malta ===
In [[Malta]], for Bachelor Honours degrees ''Summa Cum Laude'' refers to First Class Honours, ''Magna Cum Laude'' refers to Second Class Honours (Upper Division), ''Cum Laude'' refers to Second Class Honours (Lower Division) whilst ''Bene Probatus'' refers to Third Class Honours. Professional degrees lasting longer than the standard 3 years such as the 5 year Bachelor of Pharmacy are awarded ''Egregia Cum Laude''. Postgraduate Diplomas and master's degrees may be awarded as Pass with Distinction (Summa Cum Laude), Pass with Merit (Magna Cum Laude) or Pass (Bene Probatus).

=== Mexico ===
In [[Mexico]], ''cum laude'' (also known as "mención honorífica" in Spanish) is used, by the major universities, to recognize an outstanding dissertation for bachelor's, master's and PhD degrees. Also different awards on public and private universities are given to the student with the highest final grade average (i.e. [[:es:Presea Lázaro Cárdenas|Presea Lázaro Cárdenas]] or Gabino Barreda Medal) and a diploma is given as a form of ''cum laude.''

=== Netherlands ===
In [[Education in the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], both for bachelor's and master's programs, two classes of honors may be used: ''cum laude'' (with honor) and ''summa cum laude'' (with highest honor). Typically it is reserved to mark exceptional achievement. It depends on an absolute minimum grade point average. Sometimes it is lost, despite a high average mark, when the student gets a mark of 6 or lower for one of the many exams (on a scale of 1–10, where 10 is the highest). It may also be awarded based on the weighted average of first achieved grades for each subject only. Generally, less than 2% receive the ''cum laude'' distinction. It is also possible to receive a PhD degree ''cum laude'', although this honor is even rarer than for master's graduates. In view of the difficulty and subjectivity of determining this, some universities and fields of study very seldom award doctorates ''cum laude''. At Dutch University Colleges, ''cum laude'', ''magna cum laude'' and, exceptionally, ''summa cum laude'' may be used.

=== Philippines ===
[[Education in the Philippines|In the Philippines]], Junior High School - Senior High School Students under the new [[K–12|K–12 Curriculum]] an honor system using Filipino translations of the Latin original. Students who achieve a final grade average of 90-94 are awarded the title "May Karangalan" ("cum laude" in Latin or "with honors") and will receive a bronze medal with the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|DepEd]] seal.Those who have a final grade average of 95-97 receive the title of "May Mataas na Karangalan" ("magna cum laude" or "with high honors") and a silver medal with the same seal. Students with a final grade average of 98-100 shall be awarded the title of "May Pinakamataas na Karangalan" ("summa cum laude" or "with highest honors") and a gold medal with the same specification. In College, students are referred to as: Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude and Summa Cum Laude, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deped.gov.ph/sites/default/files/order/2016/DO_s2016_036.pdf |title=Policy Guidelines on Awards and Recognition for the K to 12 Basic Education Program |accessdate=January 1, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402165847/http://www.deped.gov.ph/sites/default/files/order/2016/DO_s2016_036.pdf |work=[[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] |publisher=[[Philippines]] |archive-date=April 2, 2017}}</ref>

=== Russia ===
In [[Education in Russia|Russia]], the honor system is based on the grade point averages. At least 4.75 out of 5.0 points are required for the summa cum laude degree ("с отличием" ("s otlichiem") in Russian or "with excellence").<ref>[http://lawrussia.ru/texts/legal_913/doc91a947x255.htm Russian Education Law]&nbsp;— В соответствии с Законом Российской Федерации «Об образовании» № 12-ФЗ, 13 January 1996 and типовым «Положением об итоговой аттестации выпускников высших учебных заведений», утвержденным приказом Минобразования России, 25 March 2003 № 1155.</ref> The graduate has to receive a perfect grade on all final examinations. Usually less than 2% of all graduating students accomplish this (depending on the university and year). In military schools, a "red diploma" may be accompanied by a gold medal ("summa cum laude") for outstanding performance. Russian high schools also award a gold medal to the student who achieves a perfect score in all final examinations and in all other subjects not requiring a final exam. A silver medal is awarded to high school students who have one or two grades of 4 ("хорошо" in Russian or "good", being second highest grade) on their final exams or other subjects as listed in the high school diploma ("attestat o (polnom) srednem obrazovanii").

=== Singapore ===
In [[Education in Singapore|Singapore]], the Latin honors, ''cum laude'', ''magna cum laude'' and ''summa cum laude'' are used by [[Singapore Management University]]. Graduates from Singapore Management University have to achieve GPAs of 3.4, 3.6 and 3.8 out of 4.3 (SMU awards 4.3 for A+ grades) respectively and without any exceptions to qualify for the Latin honors.

It is also used by Yale-NUS College, with the top 5% of a graduating class receiving ''summa cum laude'', the next 10% ''magna cum laude'', and the next 20% ''cum laude''. There are no CAP requirements to achieve the Latin honors at Yale-NUS College.<ref>{{cite web |title=LATIN HONOURS AT YALE-NUS COLLEGE |url=https://students.yale-nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2017/10/Yale-NUS-College-Latin-Honours-Classification.pdf |website=Yale-NUS College |publisher=Yale-NUS College |accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref>

=== Spain ===
In [[Higher education in Spain|Spain]], the Latin honors ''cum laude'' is used for PhD degrees only,  and is awarded after a secret vote of the jury members, using envelopes that must be opened in a separate session, and requiring unanimity.

=== Switzerland ===
In [[Education in Switzerland|Switzerland]], the degrees ''rite'', ''cum laude'', ''magna cum laude'', ''insigni cum laude'' and ''summa cum laude'' are used, but the exact GPA corresponding to each varies by institution.

=== Ukraine ===
In [[Education in Ukraine|Ukraine]], the university education honor system is based on by-law # 161 (02.06.1993) of The Ministry of Education of Ukraine (3.12.3.5). For a student to graduate a university with a diploma with honors (''cum laude''), students have to receive mark "5" (excellent) at least on 75% of courses, receive mark 4 (good) at max 25% of courses, and pass the state exams only with mark "5" (excellent). Also, students are expected to have participated in research projects with visible results.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/z0173-93?nreg=z0173-93&find=1&text=%E7+%E2i%E4%E7%ED%E0%EA%EE%FE&x=8&y=8 |title=Про затвердження Положення про організацію навчальног... &#124; від 02.06.1993 № 161 (Сторінка 1 з 2) |website=Zakon4.rada.gov.ua |accessdate=2017-07-18}}</ref>
