==History==
Two colleges were organized during 1851 in the small agricultural town of [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], at the height of the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], less than a year after California was granted statehood. Santa Clara College, forerunner of Santa Clara University, was the first to open its doors to students and is the state's oldest operating institution of higher education. Shortly after Santa Clara began instruction, the Methodist-run California Wesleyan College (now known as [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]]) received a charter from the State Superior Court on July 10, 1851—the first granted in California—and it began enrolling students in May of the following year.<ref name=UOPcharter>{{cite web|url=http://www.pacific.edu/About-Pacific/History-and-Mission.html |title=UOP History and Mission |access-date=June 1, 2014|publisher=University of the Pacific}}</ref> Santa Clara's Jesuit founders lacked the $20,000 endowment required for a charter, which was eventually accumulated and a charter granted on April 28, 1855.<ref>{{cite book |last=McKevitt, S.J. |first=Gerald |date=1979-01-01 |title=The University of Santa Clara: A History, 1851–1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3C2sAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA28 |publisher=Stanford Press |pages=40–48 |access-date=15 November 2017|isbn=9780804710244 }}</ref> Santa Clara bears the distinction of awarding California's first bachelor's degree, bestowed upon Thomas I.

===California mission era===
[[File:Mission Santa Clara 1849 (Project Gutenberg).jpg|thumb|250px|Mission Santa Clara de Asis in 1849]]
Inheriting the grounds of Mission Santa Clara de Asís, Santa Clara University's campus, library holdings, art collection, and many of its defining traditions date back to 1777, almost 75 years before its founding. In January of that year, Saint [[Junipero Serra]], a Spanish [[Franciscan]] [[friar]], established Mission Santa Clara as the eighth of 21 [[Alta California]] missions. Fray Tomás de la Peña chose a site along the [[Guadalupe River (California)|Guadalupe River]] for the future church, erecting a cross and celebrating the first Mass a few days later.<ref name="Mission Church Website">Teresa Pugh, [http://www.scu.edu/missionchurch/history/index.cfm History of Mission Santa Clara de Asis], Santa Clara University, 2006.</ref> Natural disasters forced early priests to relocate and rebuild the church on several occasions, moving it westward and away from the river. Built of wood, the first permanent structure quickly flooded and was replaced by a larger adobe building in 1784. This building suffered heavy damage in an 1818 earthquake and was replaced six years later by a new adobe edifice.<ref name="Mission Church Website" />

[[File:Santa Clara de Asis circa 1910 William Amos Haines.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Mission Santa Clara de Asis prior to the 1925 fire]]
The mission flourished for more than 50 years despite these setbacks. Beginning in the 1830s, however, the mission lands were repossessed in conjunction with government policy implemented via the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|Mexico's secularization]], and church buildings fell into disrepair. The Bishop of Monterey, Dominican [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], offered the site to Italian Jesuits [[John Nobili]] and Michael Accolti in 1851 on condition that they found a college for California's growing Catholic population when it became part of the United States following the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–48).<ref>Greene, Clay M. (1901) ''Souvenir of Santa Clara College'' Santa Clara: University Press</ref>

===Modern era===
In 1912 '''Santa Clara College''' became the '''University of Santa Clara''', with the addition of the [[Santa Clara University School of Engineering|School of Engineering]] and [[Santa Clara University School of Law|School of Law]]. In 1925 the [[Leavey School of Business]] was founded. Women were first admitted in 1961 to what had been an all-men's university. In 2012, Santa Clara University celebrated 50 years of having women attend Santa Clara University. This step made Santa Clara University the first Catholic university in California to admit both men and women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scu.edu/scm/spring2008/feature4.cfm|title=Santa Clara Magazine – O Pioneers!|website=Scu.edu|access-date=15 November 2017}}</ref>

In 1985, in part to avoid confusion with the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), the University of Santa Clara, as it had been known since 1912, changed its name to '''Santa Clara University'''. Diplomas were printed with the new name beginning in 1986.

In 2001 the [[Santa Clara University School of Education, Counseling Psychology, and Pastoral Ministries|School of Education and Counseling Psychology]] was formed to offer Master's level and other credential programs.

==Campus==
[[File:SCU Mission and Palm Trees.jpg|right|600px|The [[Mission Santa Clara de Asís|Santa Clara Mission]] is at the heart of SCU's historic campus.]]
The university is situated in [[Santa Clara, California]], adjacent to the city of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in [[Santa Clara County]] at the southern part of the [[Bay Area]]. Over the last century and a half, the Santa Clara University campus has expanded to more than {{convert|106|acre|ha}}.

===The modern campus===
In the 1950s, after the university constructed Walsh Hall and the [[de Saisset Museum]] on two of the last remaining open spaces on the old college campus, Santa Clara began purchasing and annexing land from the surrounding community. The first addition, which occurred slightly earlier,{{when|date=April 2010}} brought space for football and baseball playing fields. Thereafter, particularly in the 1960s when women were admitted to the school, more land was acquired for residence halls and other new buildings and facilities.

In 1989 the Santa Clara University campus was unified when [[The Alameda, San Jose, California|The Alameda]] ([[California State Route 82]]), a major thoroughfare that had bisected the university, was rerouted. Several interior roads were also closed and were replaced by sparsely landscaped pedestrian malls and plazas. The current five-year campus plan calls for integration of these areas with the gardens of the campus core.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://129.210.20.25:81/pdfs/5yearplan.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2005-09-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040726061009/http://129.210.20.25:81/pdfs/5yearplan.pdf |archive-date=2004-07-26 }}</ref>

The 1990s brought a number of campus additions, including the Music and Dance Building, a new science wing, the Arts and Sciences Building, the [[Malley Fitness Center]], the Sobrato Residence Hall, and the first on-campus parking structure. Santa Clara carried out all deferred maintenance, including the renovation of Kenna Hall, the Adobe Lodge, and many other historic buildings. One unique feature of Santa Clara University's undergraduate education is the Residential Learning Community program. Eight Residential Learning Communities (RLCs), each with a distinct theme, integrate the classroom and resident life experience.<ref>[http://www.scu.edu/rlc/basics/why.cfm Why RLCs?], Santa Clara University, retrieved March 5, 2012.</ref>

===Contemporary changes===
Recently completed expansion projects include a new baseball field ([[Stephen Schott Stadium]], 2005), a renovated basketball arena ([[Leavey Center]], 2000), Kennedy Mall – the campus' first "green building" (2005),<ref name="green">San Jose Mercury News.[http://events.mercurynews.com/santa-clara-ca/venues/show/23742-commons-at-kennedy-mall Commons at Kennedy Mall]."

The new Charney Hall (2018) replaces and consolidates Bannan Hall and the Heafey Law Library into the new Law School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.scu.edu/about-us-a-bold-vision/strategic-priorities/charney-hall/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401144654/http://law.scu.edu/about-us-a-bold-vision/strategic-priorities/charney-hall/|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 April 2018|title=Charney Hall – Santa Clara Law|date=1 April 2018}}</ref>

Future changes are to include a new dorm and the Sobrato Campus for Discovery and Innovation.

The main entrance to the campus, Palm Drive, is closed to automobiles in order to create a pedestrian mall that "highlight[s] the Mission Church as the centerpiece of the campus."<ref>[http://scu.edu/r/news/releases/release/16471/Palm-Drive-Construction-will-Create-a-New-Gateway-to-Santa-Clara-University Palm Drive Construction will Create a New Gateway to Santa Clara University – University Press Releases – Santa Clara University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625015221/http://www.scu.edu/r/news/releases/release/16471/Palm-Drive-Construction-will-Create-a-New-Gateway-to-Santa-Clara-University |date=2013-06-25 }}.

In 2015, Santa Clara University ranked No.19 on the Princeton Review's new “Top 50 Green Colleges” list and is also featured in The Princeton Review Guide to 353 Green Colleges as one of the most environmentally responsible colleges.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Awards & Recognition – About the Center – Sustainability at SCU – Santa Clara University|url = https://www.scu.edu/sustainability/about/awards/|website =Scu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-18|first = Santa Clara|last = University}}</ref>

In 2013, the Center for Sustainability was established to advance academic and public understanding of the ways in which social justice and sustainability intersect by integrating principles of social, environmental, and economic sustainability into campus operations, academic and student life, and outreach programs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = History – About the Center – Sustainability at SCU – Santa Clara University|url = https://www.scu.edu/sustainability/about/history/|website =Scu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-18|first = Santa Clara|last = University}}</ref>

==== Campus operations ====
===== Building design =====
Santa Clara University is a member of The Green Building Council, the overseeing body of the LEED rating system. In the fall of 2011, Paul Locatelli, S. J. Student Activities Center was certified LEED Gold. In addition, Schott Admission and Enrollment Services, Donohoe Alumni House, and Graham Residence Hall have all been designed to LEED gold standards and are pending certification. All new buildings are designed with the Sustainable Building Policy, adopted in May 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scu.edu/sustainability/operations/buildings/|title=Buildings & Grounds – Campus Operations – Sustainability at SCU – Santa Clara University|last=University|first=Santa Clara|website=Scu.edu|access-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>

===== Water conservation =====
* The Center for Sustainability and Associated Student Government have teamed up for ''60 Seconds Less'', a creative campaign that encourages campus affiliates to cut 60 seconds or more off their time in the shower. Using community-based marketing and incentives, student government designed a pledge, educated students on effective ways to manage their water usage, and distributed shower timers and token bracelets to prompt shorter shower reminders.
* After establishing a pilot program of California field sedge in different areas on campus grounds, a third party contractor was hired to begin transitioning unused lawn to native, drought-tolerant plants that matches the campus aesthetic. SCU is working on increasing the use of recycled water (which is already the majority of campus grounds) and all decorative fountains have been turned off or will be converted to operate with recycled water. 
* Student groups are initiating water fixture audits to determine which units should be replaced to decrease flow rates. Additionally, recycled water is also used for toilet flushing in several buildings and the expansion of recycled water use is being explored for other parts of campus operations. Recently, Facilities decided it will also no longer wash the exterior of buildings' windows. 
* Waterfree urinals and showers have been installed in restrooms throughout campus. These units are estimated to conserve an average of 40,000 gallons of water per urinal per year.
* The campus garden is replacing all annual non-vegetable plants and flowers with California natives and drought-tolerant species. The garden is also on a drip irrigation system, thus reducing the risk of over-watering vegetables and trees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scu.edu/sustainability/operations/buildings/water/|title=Water Conservation – Buildings & Grounds – Campus Operations – Sustainability at SCU – Santa Clara University|last=University|first=Santa Clara|website=Scu.edu|access-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>

===== Energy and Climate =====
* '''Climate Neutrality''': Santa Clara University is a Charter Signatory of the American College and University presidents Climate Commitment. The university first developed a Climate Neutrality Action Plan in 2010, updated the plan into two parts in 2015, and have the current goal to achieve Climate Neutrality by 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scu.edu/sustainability/commitment/climate/|title=Climate Neutrality – University Commitments – Sustainability at SCU – Santa Clara University|last=University|first=Santa Clara|website=Scu.edu|access-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>
* '''Renewable energy''': The university has publicly "committed to achieving climate neutrality by reducing emissions wherever possible, generating [its] own renewable energy when feasible, pledging zero emissions growth, and offsetting...remaining emissions." The Santa Clara University campus is currently home to photovoltaics, solar thermal systems, and a wind turbine. SCU is on course to install a smart microgrid, which ties its power source, transmission, distribution, and even consumption data to weather reports, thereby maximizing energy savings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scu.edu/sustainability/operations/energy-climate/renewable/|title=Renewable Energy – Energy & Climate – Campus Operations – Sustainability at SCU – Santa Clara University|last=University|first=Santa Clara|website=Scu.edu|access-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>
* '''Energy management''': SCU buildings have light sensors to reduce energy, use LED technology and other efficient bulbs, and timers regulate temperature based on occupancy.

==== Academic and student life ====
The university created the interdisciplinary Sustainability Minor through the Environmental Studies and Sciences department as a program for students to experience the aspects of sustainability through different lenses. This holistic approach to the study of sustainability will allow students of all academic backgrounds to learn not only about the environmental dimensions of sustainability, but also the societal and economic impacts. The minor also requires students to participate in a project-based action learning class designed to apply their classroom lessons to real sustainability issues.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sustainability – College of Arts and Sciences – Santa Clara University|url = https://www.scu.edu/cas/sustainability/|website =Scu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-18|first = Santa Clara|last = University}}</ref>

==== Outreach programs ====
The Center for Sustainability hosts the Sustainability Liaison Network. The Network consists of over 150 Sustainability Liaisons that act as peer educators for sustainability and experts on how sustainability interplays with their respective groups. The Network is a resource and collaborative space for people who are interested in working/living more sustainably in their life on and off campus.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Liaison Network Groups – Programs – Sustainability at SCU – Santa Clara University|url = https://www.scu.edu/sustainability/programs/liaisons/|website =Scu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-18|first = Santa Clara|last = University}}</ref>

At the start of the 2015 academic year, Santa Clara University announced the creation of the Campus Sustainability Investment Fund (CSIF) as a revolving green fund to support sustainability projects on the SCU campus. With the university's goal of climate-neutrality by 2020, the CSIF is an opportunity for students, staff, and faculty of SCU to contribute their own ideas to reduce carbon emissions. Similar green funds at other college campuses have netted projects like installing motion-sense lights in classrooms or information campaigns to encourage the use of re-usable water bottles.

===Student government===
The Associated Student Government of Santa Clara University (ASGSCU) is Santa Clara University's student government, an elected representative body for undergraduate students. The Associated Student Government is made up of the executive board, the Senate, Community Development, and the Judicial Branch.

===ROTC===
The Santa Clara [[US Army]] [[ROTC]] Battalion was established in 1861 due to the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. The unit was known as the Senior Company of Cadets. On September 10, 1863, [[Leland Stanford]], then [[Governor of California]], presented the Corps of Cadets with forty Springfield rifles, Model 1839. Today, the rifles are preserved in the University Museum. In return for his generosity, an armory was built in his honor in 1936. The armory was located southwest of the athletic field with the pistol range located below the stage of the auditorium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scu.edu/rotc/history.cfm|title=Military Science – College of Arts and Sciences – Santa Clara University|first=Santa Clara|last=University|website=Scu.edu|access-date=15 November 2017}}</ref>

[[Paul Locatelli]], (former) President of Santa Clara, was a cadet at the university prior to his military service and his entrance into the Jesuit Order. Two Jesuits from Santa Clara, McKinnon and McQuaide, volunteered as chaplains in the [[Spanish–American War]]. Both were part of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s American Expeditionary Force that attacked [[San Juan Hill]] on July 1, 1898.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rotc.scu.edu/Pages/Bronco%20Battalion%20History.htm|title=ROTC history at Santa Clara University|website=Scu.edu|access-date=15 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203180409/http://rotc.scu.edu/Pages/Bronco%20Battalion%20History.htm|archive-date=2007-12-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On February 2, 2010, the Santa Clara University ROTC "Bronco Battalion" won the MacArthur Award granted by the U.S. Army's Cadet Command and the General Douglas MacArthur Foundation. In 2011 the Santa Clara ROTC once again won the MacArthur Award. The award, named after late General [[Douglas MacArthur]], is granted to the year's most excellent Reserve Officers' Training Corps program among 33 battalions in the West Coast 8th Brigade. The award takes into consideration factors such as the battalion's physical fitness, navigation skills, leadership, and success in commissioning officers after ROTC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scu.edu/news/releases/release.cfm?c=6556|title=Press Releases – News & Events – Santa Clara University|first=Santa Clara|last=University|website=Scu.edu|access-date=15 November 2017}}</ref>

===Athletic programs===
{{Fanpov|date=April 2010}}
On February 2, 1993, Santa Clara president [[Paul Locatelli]], S.J. announced the discontinuation of football at the university.<ref name=sjmn>{{cite news|first=Julia|last=Prodis Sulek|title=Rev. Paul Locatelli, former Santa Clara University president, dies at 71|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_15497820|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=2010-07-12|access-date=2010-07-23|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rSijT5Gu?url=http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_15497820?nclick_check=1|archive-date=2010-07-24|url-status=live}}</ref> For many years, Santa Clara participated in NCAA Division II in football, including reaching the NCAA Division II Championship semi-finals in 1980, because of an NCAA bylaw that allowed Division I schools to participate in lower divisions in football; however, the rule was changed in the mid-1990s, and the program was forced to move into Division I-AA (now FCS). Other teams were Division I, including the men's and women's soccer teams, both of which are past NCAA Division I National Champions. The basketball teams have made regular appearances in NCAA Division I playoffs.

* The women's soccer team is consistently ranked in the top 25 nationally. [[Jerry Smith (soccer)|Jerry Smith]] is the current head coach and led the program to a national title in the 2001 [[NCAA Women's Soccer Championship]], led by future [[United States Women's National Soccer Team]] member [[Aly Wagner]]. Now married to Jerry Smith, [[Brandi Chastain]] was a member of the team's 1988 and 1989 final four seasons. Actresses [[Keira Knightley]] and [[Parminder Nagra]] win football scholarships to Santa Clara in the [[BAFTA]] nominated film ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]''.
* The men's basketball team has participated in the NCAA tournament on several occasions in past decades; the 1992–1993 team (led by future NBA MVP [[Steve Nash]]) was the second of seven No. 15 seeds to defeat Arizona the No. 2 seed in the tourney. On February 12, 2007, the men's basketball team snapped Gonzaga's 50-game home winning streak. At the time, it was the longest home winning streak in the NCAA.
* The women's basketball team started in 1963. Their most notable accomplishment was winning the [[Women's National Invitation Tournament|WNIT]] in 1991. In 2014, [[JR Payne]] was hired as the coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://santaclarabroncos.com/sports/w-baskbl/2013-14/videos/20140414-nh8o6he8|title=EYEBRONCO: Meet Women's Basketball Head Coach JR Payne|website=SAntaclarabroncos.com|access-date=15 November 2017}}</ref>
* The men's baseball program has enjoyed a storied past. The 1988 team, which still holds the best single-season record in program history, 43–18–1, participated in the West I Regional at Fresno State. That 1988 team lost in the regional to a [[John Olerud]]–led Washington State Cougar team, twice. The team was led by current Long Beach State coach [[Troy Buckley]], World Series Champion [[Ed Giovanola]] (Atlanta Braves 1996), Detroit Tiger 1st Round pick [[Greg Gohr]] (1989), Kansas City Royal draft choice [[Victor Cole]] (1988), San Diego Padres draftee Matt Toole (1989), and Wes Bliven, a California Angel draft choice (1988). During the regular season, the 1988 squad snapped the 33 game winning streak of Fresno State. That team also knocked off nationally ranked teams such as Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Loyola Marymount University, and Pepperdine University. The coach of the 1988 team was [[John Oldham (baseball)|John Oldham]].
