'''Pearl Jam''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1990 in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The band's lineup consists of founding members [[Jeff Ament]] (bass guitar), [[Stone Gossard]] (rhythm guitar), [[Mike McCready]] (lead guitar), and [[Eddie Vedder]] (lead vocals, guitar), as well as [[Matt Cameron]] (drums), who joined in 1998. Keyboardist [[Boom Gaspar]] has also been a touring/session member with the band since 2002. Drummers [[Jack Irons]], [[Dave Krusen]], [[Matt Chamberlain]], and [[Dave Abbruzzese]] are former members of the band. Pearl Jam outsold many of its contemporary alternative rock bands from the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade,<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=''Lost Dogs'' Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r666816|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=June 22, 2007|work=Allmusic}}</ref> being dubbed as "the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s".<ref name="Erlewine">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Pearl Jam > Biography|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5118|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=June 22, 2007|work=Allmusic}}</ref>

Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, [[Mother Love Bone]], Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', in 1991. ''Ten'' stayed on the ''[[Billboard 200|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]] chart for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going [[RIAA certification|13x platinum]] in the United States. Released in 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'', sold over 950,000 copies in its first week of release, setting the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release at the time. Their third album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994), became the second-fastest-selling CD in history at the time, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.

One of the key bands in the [[grunge]] movement of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or giving interviews. The band also sued [[Ticketmaster]], claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the band as having "spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame."<ref name="secondcoming">{{cite web | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming | title = The Second Coming of Pearl Jam | work = Rolling Stone | date = June 16, 2006 | accessdate = June 22, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070528041642/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming |archivedate = May 28, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Bush|George W. Bush's presidency]]. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1984–1990)===
[[Stone Gossard]] and [[Jeff Ament]] were members of grunge band [[Green River (band)|Green River]] during the mid-1980s. Green River toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and bandmates [[Mark Arm]] and [[Steve Turner (guitarist)|Steve Turner]].<ref>Azerrad, Michael. ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]''. Little Brown and Company, 2001. {{ISBN|0-316-78753-1}}, p. 422.</ref> In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with [[Malfunkshun]] vocalist [[Andrew Wood (singer)|Andrew Wood]], eventually organizing the band [[Mother Love Bone]]. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing interest and found the support of the [[PolyGram]] record label, which signed the band in early 1989. Mother Love Bone's debut album, ''[[Apple (Mother Love Bone album)|Apple]]'', was released in July 1990, four months after Wood died of a [[heroin overdose]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Friend | first = Lonn M. | url = http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/rip_7-92.shtml | title = Heroes... and Heroin | work = [[RIP (magazine)|RIP]] |date=July 1992 | accessdate = June 22, 2007}}</ref>

Ament and Gossard were devastated by the death of Wood and the resulting demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously.<ref name="crowe">{{cite web | last = Crowe | first = Cameron | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10560431/five_against_the_world | title = Five Against the World | work = Rolling Stone | date = October 28, 1993 | accessdate = June 23, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070619084803/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10560431/five_against_the_world |archivedate = June 19, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament.<ref name="secondcoming" /> After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Jack Irons]] the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.<ref name="crowe" />

Irons passed on the invitation but gave the demo to his basketball friend, [[San Diego, California]] singer [[Eddie Vedder]].<ref>Wall, Mick. "Alive". ''Nirvana and the Story of Grunge''. ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' p. 95</ref> Vedder was the lead vocalist for a San Diego band, [[Bad Radio]], and worked part-time at a gas station. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him.<ref name="crowe" /> He then recorded the vocals to three of the songs ("[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]", "[[Once (Pearl Jam song)|Once]]", and "Footsteps") in what he later described as a "mini-opera" entitled ''Momma-Son''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pearl Jam Twenty |last=Pearl Jam |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-1-84887-493-0 |page= 39}}</ref> Vedder sent the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were impressed enough to fly Vedder up to Seattle for an audition. Within a week, Vedder had joined the band.<ref name="crowe" />

With the addition of [[Dave Krusen]] on drums, the band took the name Mookie Blaylock, in reference to the then-active [[Mookie Blaylock|basketball player]].<ref name="Modern Drummer 1993"/> The band played its first official show at the Off Ramp Café in Seattle on October 22, 1990.<ref name="timeline">{{cite web | url=http://www.pearljam.com/timeline/ | title=Pearl Jam: Timeline | accessdate=June 27, 2007 | publisher=Pearljam.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080109033804/http://www.pearljam.com/timeline/ |archivedate = January 9, 2008}}</ref> They opened for [[Alice in Chains]] at the [[Moore Theatre]] in Seattle on December 22, 1990,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTg4whS9ClUC&q=credibility |title=Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music, 2009 |website=Google Books |isbn=9781554903474 |access-date=June 6, 2017|last1=Prato |first1=Greg |date=December 15, 2010 }}</ref> and served as the opening act for the band's  ''[[Facelift (album)|Facelift]]'' tour in 1991.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Robinson|first1=John|title=Kurt Cobain Raised the Bar for Us...|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/pearl_jam/interviews/12930|magazine=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twofeetthick.com/2011/02/19/we-toured-young-mookie-blaylock-alice-in-chains-199/|title=We Toured Young: Mookie Blaylock and Alice in Chains 1991|date=February 19, 2011|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}</ref>  Mookie Blaylock soon signed to [[Epic Records]] and renamed themselves Pearl Jam.<ref name="Erlewine" /> In an early promotional interview, Vedder said that the name "Pearl Jam" was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special recipe for [[peyote]]-laced jam.<ref name="rhrn">Neely, Kim. "Right Here, Right Now". ''Rolling Stone''.

Released on August 27, 1991, ''Ten'' (named after Mookie Blaylock's jersey number)<ref name="rhrn" /> contained eleven tracks dealing with dark subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. ''Ten''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s musical style, influenced by classic rock, combined an "expansive harmonic vocabulary" with an anthemic sound.<ref>{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r14978|pure_url=yes}} | title=Ten > Review | accessdate=July 3, 2007 | author=Huey, Steve | website=Allmusic}}</ref> The album was slow to sell, but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name="blackdays" /> ''Ten'' produced the hit singles "Alive", "[[Even Flow]]", and "[[Jeremy (song)|Jeremy]]". Originally interpreted as an anthem by many,<ref name="crowe" /> Vedder later revealed that "Alive" tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather, while his mother's grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father. In this lyric, even though Vedder originally looked at "being alive as a curse," as the sadness the speaker in the song suggests, "...But as fans quickly turned the title phrase into a self-empowering anthem, particularly at Pearl Jam concerts, Vedder said, "they lifted the curse. The audience changed the meaning for me," he told VH1 Storytellers in 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58253/pearl-jam-tells-its-story-at-vh1-taping|website=Billboard|title=Pearl Jam tells its 'story' at VH1 taping|date=June 2, 2006}}</ref>

The song "Jeremy" and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sshep.com/jeremynew.htm | title=Richardson Teen-ager Kills Himself in Front of Classmates | accessdate=June 27, 2007 | author=Miller, Bobbi | work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] | date=January 8, 1991 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201141859/http://www.sshep.com/jeremynew.htm | archive-date=February 1, 2010 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> ''Ten'' stayed on the ''Billboard'' charts for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going [[RIAA certification|13x platinum]].<ref>{{cite web

With the success of ''Ten'', Pearl Jam became a key member of the Seattle grunge explosion, along with [[Alice in Chains]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and [[Soundgarden]]. The band was criticized in the music press; British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' said that Pearl Jam was "trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets."<ref>Gilbert, Jeff. "New Power Generation". ''Guitar World: Nirvana and the Seattle Sound''. 1993.</ref> Nirvana's [[Kurt Cobain]] angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band were commercial [[selling out|sellouts]],<ref name="combain sellouts">Al & Cake. "An interview with...Kurt Cobain". ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]''.

Pearl Jam [[Ten Tour|toured]] relentlessly in support of ''Ten''. Ament stated that "essentially ''Ten'' was just an excuse to tour," adding, "We told the record company, 'We know we can be a great band, so let's just get the opportunity to get out and play.'"<ref>Coryat, Karl. "Godfather of the 'G' Word". ''Bass Player'' magazine. April 1994.</ref> The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it."<ref name="tenpast"/> Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates."<ref>{{cite web | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 | title = Eddie Vedder's Embarrassing Tale: Naked in Public | work = Rolling Stone | date = June 20, 2006 | accessdate = March 3, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620071621/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 |archivedate = June 20, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1992, Pearl Jam made television appearances on ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''[[MTV Unplugged (Pearl Jam album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' and took a slot on that summer's [[Lollapalooza]] tour with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and Soundgarden, among others.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weingarten|first=Christopher R.|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/saturday-night-live-rocks-25-greatest-musical-performances-w468638/pearl-jam-april-11th-1992-w468656|title='Saturday Night Live' Rocks: 25 Greatest Musical Performances|work=Rolling Stone|date=March 9, 2017|accessdate=May 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Greene|first=Andy|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-pearl-jam-play-intense-black-on-mtv-unplugged-20150305|title=Flashback: Pearl Jam Play Intense 'Black' on 'MTV Unplugged'|work=Rolling Stone|date=March 5, 2015|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Montgommery|first=James|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1644863/lollapalooza-lookback-1992-meet-pearl-jam/|title=Lollapalooza Lookback 1992: Meet Pearl Jam|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=August 2, 2010|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}</ref> The band contributed two songs to the [[Singles: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] of the 1992 [[Cameron Crowe]] film ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]'': "[[State of Love and Trust]]" and "[[Breath (Pearl Jam song)|Breath]]".

===''Vs.'', ''Vitalogy'' and dealing with success (1993–1995)===
The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder.<ref name="crowe" /> While Pearl Jam received four awards at the [[1993 MTV Video Music Awards]] for its video for "Jeremy", including [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]], the band refused to make a video for "[[Black (Pearl Jam song)|Black]]" in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own interpretations of the song, stating that "Before music videos first came out, you'd listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you'd come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression."<ref>Neely, Kim. Five Against One: The Pearl Jam Story. "The Lost 'Jeremy' Video. pp. 109–113. New York, NY. Penguin Books.</ref>
"Ten years from now," Ament said, "I don't want people to remember our songs as videos."<ref name="crowe" />

Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, "The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy."<ref name="totalguitar">"Interview with Stone Gossard and Mike McCready". ''[[Total Guitar]]''.

The authors said, "The pervasiveness of Ticketmaster's exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act."

The [[United States Department of Justice]] was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company.

He also stated that sources said that most of the band's third album ''[[Vitalogy]]'' was completed by early 1994, but that either a forced delay by Epic or the battle with Ticketmaster were to blame for the delay.<ref name="DeRogatis1"/>

Pearl Jam wrote and recorded while touring behind ''Vs.'' and the majority of the tracks for ''Vitalogy'' were recorded during breaks on the tour. Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by this time. Producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] said, "''Vitalogy'' was a little strained. I'm being polite—there was some imploding going on."<ref name="tenpast"/><ref name=fiveH>{{cite web|title=Ten Past Ten (archive on web site Five Horizons)|url=http://www.fivehorizons.com/archive/articles/spin801.shtml}}</ref> After Pearl Jam finished the recording of ''Vitalogy'', drummer Dave Abbruzzese was fired. The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, Abbruzzese disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott.<ref name="tenpast"/><ref name="fiveH"/> He was replaced by [[Jack Irons]], who had connected Vedder to the rest of the band some four years prior. Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young's 1994 [[Bridge School Benefit]], but he was not officially announced as the band's new drummer until its 1995 ''Self-Pollution'' satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour-long pirate broadcast out of Seattle which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it.<ref>Gaar, Gillian G. "Radio Free Vedder". ''Rolling Stone''. February 23, 1995.</ref>

''Vitalogy'' was released first on November 22, 1994 on vinyl and then two weeks later on December 6, 1994 on CD and cassette. The CD became the second-fastest-selling in history, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.<ref name="timeline"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of AllMusic said that "thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, ''Vitalogy'' stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album."<ref>{{cite web | last = Erlewine | first = Stephen Thomas | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r207150|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Vitalogy'' > Review | work = Allmusic | accessdate = April 29, 2007}}</ref> Many of the songs on the album appear to be inspired by the pressures of fame.<ref>Weisel, Al.

''Vitalogy'' also included the songs "[[Not for You]]", "[[Corduroy (song)|Corduroy]]", "[[Better Man (Pearl Jam song)|Better Man]]", and "[[Immortality (Pearl Jam song)|Immortality]]". "Better Man" ({{Audio-nohelp|Better Man.ogg|sample}}), a song originally written and performed by Vedder while in Bad Radio, reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock chart, spending a total of eight weeks there. Considered a "blatantly great pop song" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from ''Vs.'' due to its accessibility.<ref name="tenpast" /><ref name="fiveH"/>

The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its [[Vitalogy Tour|1995 tour]] for ''Vitalogy'', but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined in.<ref>DeRogatis, p. 64.</ref> Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States for the next three years.<ref>DeRogatis, p. 65.</ref> Ament later said, "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career."<ref name="tenpast" /><ref name="fiveH"/> In the same year Pearl Jam backed [[Neil Young]], whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album ''[[Mirror Ball (Neil Young album)|Mirror Ball]]''. Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes.<ref name="Erlewine"/> Two songs from the sessions were left off ''Mirror Ball'': "[[I Got Id]]" and "Long Road". These two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam in the form of the 1995 EP, ''[[Merkin Ball]]''.

===''No Code'' and ''Yield'' (1996–1999)===
Following the round of touring for ''Vitalogy'', the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, ''[[No Code]]''.

''No Code'' included the singles "[[Who You Are (Pearl Jam song)|Who You Are]]" ({{Audio|Who You Are.ogg|sample}}), "[[Hail, Hail]]", and "[[Off He Goes]]". As with ''Vitalogy'', very little touring was done to promote ''No Code'' because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A [[No Code Tour|European tour]] took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was "a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time" and that "it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band."<ref name=tenpast /><ref name="fiveH"/>

Following the short tour for ''No Code'', the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort among all members of the group, with Ament stating that "everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band."<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433095/19980204/story.jhtml "Pearl Jam Talks About New Approach To ''Yield''"].

In April 1998, Pearl Jam once again changed drummers. Jack Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring and was replaced with former Soundgarden drummer [[Matt Cameron]] on an initially temporary basis,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pearljam/articles/story/5928493/off_he_goes | title=Off He Goes | accessdate=June 28, 2007 | author=Fischer, Blair R | work=Rolling Stone | date=April 17, 1998|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071002115935/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pearljam/articles/story/5928493/off_he_goes |archivedate = October 2, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. Pearl Jam's 1998 [[Yield Tour]] in North America marked the band's return to full-scale touring. The band's [[Competition law|anti-trust]] lawsuit against Ticketmaster had proven to be unsuccessful and hindered live tours. Many fans had complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use of non-Ticketmaster venues, which were judged to be out-of-the-way and impersonal. For this tour and future tours, Pearl Jam once again began using Ticketmaster in order to "better accommodate concertgoers."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b35954_pearl_jam_yields_ticketmaster.html | title=Pearl Jam Yields to Ticketmaster | accessdate=June 27, 2007 | author=Symonds, Jeff | publisher=[[E!|E!

In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded "[[Last Kiss#Pearl Jam version|Last Kiss]]", a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers]]. It was recorded during a soundcheck and released on the band's 1998 [[fan club]] Christmas single. The following year, the cover was put into heavy rotation across the country. By popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999, with all of the proceeds going to the aid of refugees of the [[Kosovo War]].<ref name="timeline"/> The band also decided to include the song on the 1999 charity compilation album, ''[[No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees]]''. "Last Kiss" peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' charts and became the band's highest-charting single.

===''Binaural'' and the Roskilde tragedy (2000–2001)===
Following its full-scale tour in support of ''Yield'', the band took a short break, but then reconvened toward the end of 1999 and commenced work on a new album. On May 16, 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, ''[[Binaural (album)|Binaural]]''. It was drummer Matt Cameron's studio recording debut with the band. The title is a reference to the [[binaural recording]] techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer [[Tchad Blake]], known for his use of the technique.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pearljam.netmark.pl/newsy/spi.txt | title=Pearl Jam's 'Binaural' ear-marked by unusual sound mixing | accessdate=June 28, 2007 | author=Stout, Gene | work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date=May 16, 2000}}</ref> ''Binaural'' was the first album since the band's debut not produced by Brendan O'Brien, although O'Brien was called in later to remix several tracks. Gossard stated that the band members "were ready for a change."<ref name="totalguitar"/> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''Rolling Stone'' said, "Apparently as tired of grunge as everyone except [[Creed (band)|Creed]] fans, Pearl Jam delve elsewhere." He added, "The album reflects both Pearl Jam's longstanding curse of self-importance and a renewed willingness to be experimental or just plain odd."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pearljam/albums/album/94578/review/5941143/binaural | title=Pearl Jam: ''Binaural'' | accessdate=May 28, 2008 | author=Pareles, Jon | work=Rolling Stone | date=June 8, 2000|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014061107/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pearljam/albums/album/94578/review/5941143/binaural |archivedate = October 14, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The album is lyrically darker than the band's previous album ''Yield'', with Gossard describing the lyrics as "pretty sombre."<ref name="Mulvey"/> ''Binaural'' included the singles "[[Nothing as It Seems]]" ({{Audio|Nothing As It Seems.ogg|sample}}), one of the songs featuring binaural recording, and "[[Light Years (Pearl Jam song)|Light Years]]".

Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour ended in tragedy on June 30, with an accident at the [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death as the crowd rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but it was already too late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64953416.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125030144/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64953416.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=January 25, 2013 | title=Pearl Jam's darkest hour: Seattle band thought about quitting after concert deaths | accessdate=August 14, 2012 | author=Stout, Gene | work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date=September 1, 2000}}</ref>

He noted that "I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t2000p3.shtml | title=Pearl Jam: 2000 Concert Chronology Part 3 | accessdate=July 1, 2007 | publisher=Fivehorizons.com}}</ref> After concluding the Binaural Tour, the band released ''[[Touring Band 2000]]'' the following year. The DVD featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour.

Following the events of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], Vedder and McCready were joined by [[Neil Young]] to perform the song "Long Road" from the ''Merkin Ball'' EP at the ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' benefit concert.

In 2003, the band embarked on its [[Riot Act Tour]], which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Tokyo, [[State College, Pennsylvania]], two shows from [[Madison Square Garden]], and [[Mansfield, Massachusetts]]. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed ''Riot Act'''s "Bu$hleaguer", a commentary on President [[George W. Bush]], with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had "impaled" the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's [[Denver, Colorado]] show.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2916155.stm | title=Pearl Jam Bush Stunt Angers Fans | accessdate=July 1, 2007 | publisher=[[BBC|BBC News]] | date=April 4, 2003}}</ref>

Pearl Jam played a show at Easy Street Records in Seattle in April 2005; recordings from the show were compiled for the ''[[Live at Easy Street]]'' album and released exclusively to independent record stores in June 2006.

After touring Canada, Pearl Jam proceeded to open a [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] concert in Pittsburgh, then played two shows at the [[Borgata]] casino in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], before closing the tour with a concert in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. The official bootlegs for the band's 2005 shows were distributed via Pearl Jam's official website in MP3 form.

The work for Pearl Jam's follow-up to ''Riot Act'' began after its appearance on the 2004 [[Vote for Change]] tour. The time period between the two albums was the longest gap between Pearl Jam's studio albums to date and the new album was its first release for a new label. [[Clive Davis]] announced in February 2006 that Pearl Jam had signed with his label, [[J Records]], which like Epic, is part of [[Sony Music Entertainment]] (then known as [[Sony BMG]]), though J has since folded into [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/09/sbt.01.html | title=Showbiz Tonight | accessdate=September 3, 2007 | publisher=CNN |date=February 9, 2006}}</ref> The band's eighth studio album, ''[[Pearl Jam (album)|Pearl Jam]]'', was released on May 2, 2006.

"[[World Wide Suicide]]", a song criticizing the [[Iraq War]] and U.S. foreign policy, was released as a single and topped the [[Alternative Songs|''Billboard'' Modern Rock]] chart; it was Pearl Jam's first number one on that chart since "[[Who You Are (Pearl Jam song)|Who You Are]]" in 1996, and first number one on any chart in the United States since 1998 when "[[Given to Fly]]" reached number one on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] chart. ''Pearl Jam'' also included the singles "[[Life Wasted]]" and "[[Gone (Pearl Jam song)|Gone]]".

To support ''Pearl Jam'', the band embarked on its [[Pearl Jam 2006 World Tour|2006 world tour]]. It toured North America, Australia and notably Europe; Pearl Jam had not toured the continent for six years. The North American tour included three two-night stands opening for [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10025035/tom_petty_readies_summer_tour | title=Tom Petty Readies Summer Tour | accessdate=July 22, 2009 | author=Rogulewski, Charley | work=Rolling Stone | date=April 20, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070602102253/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10025035/tom_petty_readies_summer_tour |archivedate = June 2, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band served as the headliners for the [[Reading and Leeds Festival|Leeds]] and [[Reading Festival|Reading]] festivals, despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]].

Pearl Jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases. As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less [[Hook (music)|catchy]]. He said, "I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes."<ref name="secondcoming"/> By 1994's ''[[Vitalogy]]'', the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E0DC1030F937A35751C1A962958260 | title=RECORDINGS VIEW; Pearl Jam Gives Voice To Sisyphus | accessdate=December 13, 2007 | author=Jon Pareles | work=The New York Times | date=December 4, 1994}}</ref> The band's 1996 album, ''[[No Code]]'', was a deliberate break from the musical style of ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''.

Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder's vocals as a "[[Jim Morrison]]-like vocal growl."<ref>DeRogatis, p. 57.</ref> Greg Prato of AllMusic said, "With his hard-hitting and often confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also became one of the most copied lead singers in all of rock."<ref>{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p134417|pure_url=yes}} | title = Eddie Vedder > Biography | accessdate=April 20, 2009 | last = Prato | first = Greg | work =Allmusic}}</ref> Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal ("Alive", "Better Man") to social and political concerns ("Even Flow", "World Wide Suicide"). His lyrics have often invoked the use of [[storytelling]] and have included themes of [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]], [[individualism]], and sympathy for troubled individuals.<ref>Tannenbaum, Rob. "Rebels Without a Pause". ''[[George (magazine)|George]]''. July 2000.</ref> When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the ''Vitalogy'' era. McCready said in 2006, "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a [[power chord]] thing, and I fit into all that."<ref>Cross, Charles R. "Better Man".

While Nirvana had brought grunge to the [[mainstream]] in the early 1990s with ''[[Nevermind]]'', Pearl Jam's debut ''Ten'' outsold it in the United States,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pearl Jam: 'You, My Son, Are Weird!'|url = http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/pearl-jam-you-my-son-are-weird|website = www.rocksbackpages.com|accessdate = October 13, 2015|publisher = [[Q (magazine)|Q]]|first = Mat|last = Snow|date = November 1993}}</ref> and the band became "the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s" according to AllMusic.<ref name="Erlewine" /> Pearl Jam has been described as "[[modern rock]] radio's most influential stylists&nbsp;– the workmanlike midtempo chug of songs like "Alive" and "Even Flow" just melodic enough to get [[moshing|moshers]] singing along."<ref>Sinagra, Laura. "Grunge". ''Spin: 20 Years of Alternative Music.'' Three Rivers Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-307-23662-5}}, p. 150.</ref> The band inspired and influenced a number of bands, ranging from [[Silverchair]] to [[Puddle of Mudd]] and [[The Strokes]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/06/19/tem_ae19pearljam.html | title=Pearl Jam's tour even surprised bassist Ament | accessdate=July 1, 2007 | author=Jenkins, Mandy | work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] | date=June 19, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58184/mercy-strokes-cover-gaye-with-vedder-homme | title='Mercy': Strokes Cover Gaye With Vedder, Homme | accessdate=July 10, 2007 | author=Cohen, Jonathan | work=Billboard | date=June 9, 2006}}</ref> The band has also been credited for inspiring the indie rock scene of 90s-era urban Pakistan, that has since evolved into a rich rock music culture in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/189422/the-vedderisation-of-pakistani-rock-its-still-alive/ | title=The 'Vedderisation' of Pakistani rock: It's still alive | accessdate=June 16, 2011 | author=Khan, Laaleen | work=The Express Tribune | date=June 16, 2011}}</ref>

Pearl Jam were ranked at number 8 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in its ''Top Ten Live Acts of all Time'' issue.<ref name="PJ is life">{{cite web|url=  https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/rolling-stone-readers-pick-the-top-ten-live-acts-of-all-time-11789/2-the-rolling-stones-22923/|work=Rolling Stone|title=Rolling Stone Readers Pick the Top Ten Live Acts of All Time|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=December 10, 2018}}</ref> Pearl Jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic [[Jim DeRogatis]] said in the aftermath of the band's battle with Ticketmaster that it "proved that a rock band which isn't {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every last dime... it indicated that idealism in rock 'n' roll is not the sole province of those '60s bands enshrined in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]."<ref>DeRogatis, p. 66.</ref> Eric Weisbard of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said in 2001, "The group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a rock band as exists."<ref name="tenpast" /><ref name="fiveH"/> In a 2005 ''[[USA Today]]'' reader's poll, Pearl Jam was voted the greatest American rock band of all time.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/popcandy/2005-07-05-pop-candy_x.htm | title=And the Greatest American rock band ever is... | accessdate=May 7, 2007 | author=Matheson, Whitney | work=USA Today | date=July 5, 2005}}</ref> In April 2006, Pearl Jam was awarded the prize for "Best Live Act" in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'''s Esky Music Awards. The blurb called Pearl Jam "the rare superstars who still play as though each show could be their last."<ref name="Esky">{{cite news | title= The 2006 Esky Music Awards|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |date=April 2006}}</ref> Pearl Jam's fanbase following has been compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]]'s, with ''Rolling Stone'' magazine stating that Pearl Jam "toured incessantly and became one of rock's great arena acts, attracting a fanatical, Grateful Dead-like cult following with marathon,  true-believer shows in the vanishing spirit of Bruce Springsteen, the Who and U2."<ref name="secondcoming" />

When asked about Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, "I think at some point along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people something to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren't always easy, but I think we found a way."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/19/entertainment/ca-38639 | title=Pearl Jam Does the Evolution | accessdate=January 28, 2009 | author=Hilburn, Robert | work=Los Angeles Times | date=October 19, 2000}}</ref> Their 1992 [[MTV Unplugged (Pearl Jam album)|MTV Unplugged]] performance was ranked second in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of its 15 Best Episodes.<ref name="MTVUG">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/mtv-unplugged-the-15-best-episodes-119361/rod-stewart-1993-120007/|title='MTV Unplugged': The 15 Best Episodes|publisher=Rolling Stone|author=Andy Greene|date=n.d.|accessdate=January 15, 2020}}</ref>

==Campaigning and activism==
Throughout its career, Pearl Jam has promoted wider social and political issues, from [[pro-choice]] sentiments to opposition to [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush's presidency]]. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues. The band has promoted an array of causes, including awareness of [[Crohn's disease]], which Mike McCready suffers from, [[Ticketmaster]] venue monopolization and the environment and wildlife protection, among others.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2006/07/pearl-jamsleaterkinney.html | title= Pearl Jam/Sleater-Kinney, Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, Portland, OR 7/20/2006 | accessdate=July 10, 2007 | author=duBrowa, Cory | work=[[Paste Magazine]]}}</ref><ref name="causes">{{cite web | url=http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/PearlJam/activism/alist.html | title=Pearl Jam Synergy | accessdate=June 26, 2007 | publisher=Sonymusic.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618075914/http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/PearlJam/activism/alist.html |archivedate = June 18, 2007}}</ref> Guitarist Stone Gossard has been active in environmental pursuits, and has been an advocate of Pearl Jam's [[carbon neutral]] policy, offsetting the band's environmental impact.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2006/07/21/vanschagen/ | title="Jam Session" – Interview with Stone Gossard | accessdate=November 1, 2008 | author=Van Schagen, Sarah | publisher=grist.org | date=July 21, 2006}}</ref> Vedder has advocated for the release of the [[West Memphis 3]] for years and [[Damien Echols]], a member of the three, shares a writing credit for the song "Army Reserve" (from ''[[Pearl Jam (album)|Pearl Jam]]'').<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wm3.org/live/newsevents/newsitem.php?news_Id=116 | title= Echols contributes to new Pearl Jam album | accessdate=July 22, 2007 | publisher=wm3.org|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003356/http://www.wm3.org/live/newsevents/newsitem.php?news_Id=116 |archivedate = September 28, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The band, and especially frontman Eddie Vedder, have been vocal supporters of the pro-choice movement. In 1992, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' printed an article by Vedder, entitled "Reclamation", which detailed his views on abortion.<ref>Vedder, Eddie. "Reclamation". ''Spin''. November 1992.</ref> In an ''[[MTV Unplugged (Pearl Jam album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' concert the same year, Vedder stood on a stool and wrote "PRO-CHOICE!" on his arm in protest when the band performed the song "Porch".<ref name="tenpast" /><ref name="fiveH"/> The band are members of a number of pro-choice organizations, including [[Choice USA]] and [[Voters for Choice]].<ref name="causes" />

As members of [[Rock the Vote]] and [[Vote for Change]], the band has encouraged voter registration and participation in [[Elections in the United States|United States elections]]. Vedder was outspoken in support of [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in 2000,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/log/2000/09/26/vedder/index.html |title=Vedder on Nader: The better man |accessdate=September 3, 2007 |author=Talvi, Silja J.

In a ''Rolling Stone'' feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour's performers, Vedder told the magazine, "I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We have to get a new administration in."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6487639/voices_for_change | title=Voices for Change | accessdate=September 3, 2007 | work=Rolling Stone | date=October 14, 2004|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807100755/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6487639/voices_for_change |archivedate = August 7, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2006, the members of Pearl Jam founded the non-profit organization Vitalogy Foundation. Named after their [[Vitalogy|third studio album]], the foundation supports non-profit organizations working in the fields of community health, the environment, arts, education and social change.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://pearljam.com/acts/vitalogy |title=The Vitalogy Foundation |website=pearljam.com}}</ref>

Vedder sometimes comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy, and a number of his songs, including "Bu$hleaguer" and "[[World Wide Suicide]]", are openly critical of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]. At Lollapalooza 2007, Vedder spoke out against [[BP|BP Amoco]] [[BP#Lake Michigan Plant expansion|dumping effluent in Lake Michigan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/pearl-jam/30173 |title=Pearl Jam Close Out Last Night at Lollapalooza |accessdate=April 25, 2009 |work=NME |date=August 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430120637/http://www.nme.com/news/pearl-jam/30173 |archivedate=April 30, 2009 }}</ref> and at the end of "Daughter", he sang the lyrics "George Bush leave this world alone/George Bush find yourself another home". In the beginning of the second encore Vedder invited Iraq war veteran Tomas Young, the subject of the documentary ''[[Body of War]]'', onto the stage to urge an end to the war. Young in turn introduced [[Ben Harper]], who contributed vocals to "No More" and "Rockin' in the Free World".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hybridmagazine.com/music/0807/lollapalooza.shtml | title= Lollapalooza 2007 | accessdate=August 6, 2007 | author=Warren, Dan| publisher=Hybrid Magazine | date=August 6, 2007}}</ref> The band later discovered that some of the Bush-related lyrics were excised from the [[AT&T]] webcast of the event, and questioned whether that constitutes censorship.<ref>{{cite news | author=Jon Healey | url=http://opinion.latimes.com/bitplayer/2007/08/att-drops-pearl.html | title=AT&T drops Pearl Jam's call | accessdate=November 22, 2015 | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=August 8, 2007}}</ref> AT&T later apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor [[Davie Brown Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,135767-c,techindustrytrends/article.html |title=AT&T Says It Didn't Censor Pearl Jam |accessdate=August 9, 2007 |author=Gross, Grant |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG News Service]] |date=August 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184638/http://www.pcworld.com/article/id%2C135767-c%2Ctechindustrytrends/article.html |archive-date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref>

Pearl Jam has performed numerous benefit concerts in aid of charities. For example, the band headlined a Seattle concert in 2001 to support the United Nations' efforts to combat world hunger.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1446419/20010807/pearl_jam.jhtml | title=Pearl Jam To Play For Charity | accessdate=July 31, 2007 | author=Schumacher-Rasmussen, Eric | publisher=MTV | date=August 7, 2001}}</ref> The band added a date at the Chicago House of Blues to its 2005 tour to help the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]]; the concert proceeds were donated to [[Habitat for Humanity International|Habitat for Humanity]], the [[American Red Cross]] and the Jazz Foundation of America.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61460/update-pearl-jam-the-roots-plan-katrina-benefits | title=Pearl Jam, The Roots Plan Katrina Benefits | accessdate=July 31, 2007 | author=Cohen, Jonathan | work=Billboard | date=September 14, 2005}}</ref>

In 2011, Pearl Jam was named 2011 Planet Defenders by Rock The Earth for their environmental activism and their large-scale efforts to decrease their own carbon emissions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.upvenue.com/article/1347-pearl-jam-is-announced-as-2011-planet-defenders-on-earth-day.html | title=Pearl Jam Is Announced as 2011 Planet Defenders on Earth Day | accessdate=April 23, 2011 | work=UpVenue | date=April 23, 2011}}</ref>
