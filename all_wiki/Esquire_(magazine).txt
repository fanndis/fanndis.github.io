'''''Esquire''''' is an American [[men's magazine]]. In the United States, it has been published by the [[Hearst Corporation]] since 1986, also having over 20 international editions.

Founded in 1933, it flourished during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] under the guidance of founders [[Arnold Gingrich]], [[David A. Smart]] and [[Henry L. Jackson]] while during the 1960s it pioneered the "new journalism" movement. After a period of quick and drastic decline during the 1990s, the magazine revamped itself as a lifestyle-heavy publication under the direction of David Granger.

==History==
''Esquire'' was first issued in October 1933<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bill Osgerby|s2cid=193234935|title=The Bachelor Pad as Cultural Icon|journal=Journal of Design History|date=Spring 2005|volume=18|issue=1|pages=99–113|jstor=3527021|doi=10.1093/jdh/epi008}}</ref> as an offshoot of trade magazine ''Apparel Arts'' (which later became ''[[Gentleman's Quarterly]]''; both ''Esquire'' and ''GQ'' would share common ownership for almost 45 years). The magazine was first headquartered in Chicago and then, in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Tungate|title=Branded Male: Marketing to Men|url=https://archive.org/details/brandedmalemarke0000tung|url-access=registration|accessdate=March 14, 2016|year=2008|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=978-0-7494-5011-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/brandedmalemarke0000tung/page/120 120]}}</ref>  It was founded and edited by [[David A. Smart]], [[Henry L. Jackson]] and [[Arnold Gingrich]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iconicmagazines.com/shop/esquire/|title=Iconic Magazines - The history of Esquire magazine|work=iconicmagazines.com}}</ref> Jackson died in the crash of [[United Airlines Flight 624]] in 1948, while Gingrich led the magazine until his own death in 1976. Smart died in 1952, although he left ''Esquire'' in 1936 to found a different magazine for the company, ''[[Coronet (magazine)|Coronet]]''. The founders all had different focuses; Gingrich specialized in publishing, Smart led the business side of the magazine while Jackson led and edited the fashion section, which made up most of the magazine in its first fifteen years of publishing. Additionally, Jackson's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political viewpoints contrasted with the [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] views of Smart, which allowed for the magazine to publish debates between the two.

''Esquire'' initially was supposed to have a quarterly press run of a hundred thousand copies. It cost fifty cents per copy (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.50|1933|r=2}} today).<ref>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Theodore|title=Magazines in the Twentieth Century|year=1956|publisher=University of Illinois|oclc=2770519|ol=6197440M|pages=260–262}}</ref> However, demand was so high that by its second issue (January 1934), it transformed itself into a more refined [[Periodical literature|periodical]] with an emphasis on men's fashion and contributions by [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]],<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Esquire-American-magazine|title=Esquire {{!}} American magazine|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=August 22, 2017|language=en}}</ref> [[Alberto Moravia]], [[André Gide]], and [[Julian Huxley]].

In the 1940s, the popularity of the [[George Petty|Petty Girls]] and [[Alberto Vargas|Vargas Girls]], particularly among the Armed Forces provided a circulation boost, but also proved controversial: in 1943, the Democratic [[United States Postmaster General]] [[Frank Comerford Walker]] brought charges against the magazine on behalf of the administration of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/192802/Esquire|title=Esquire|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> which alleged that ''Esquire'' had used the [[US Postal Service]] to promote "lewd images". Republicans opposed the lawsuit and in 1946 the [[United States Supreme Court]] found in [[Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc.|''Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc.'', 327 U.S. 146 (1946)]], that ''Esquire''{{'s}} right to use the Postal Service was protected by the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1990/spring/esquire-v-walker-1.html|title=Prologue: Selected Articles|date=March 8, 2012|work=archives.gov}}</ref>

Beginning with its second number, a blond, pop-eyed, mustachioed character named "Esky" (created by cartoonists [[E. Simms Campbell]] and [[Sam Berman]]), graced almost every ''Esquire'' front page for over a quarter of a century, depicting the refined character of the magazine and its readership, mostly in the form of figurines, although during the 1950s, a stylized design of his face would often appear. Beginning in 1962, Esky would be featured as the dot on the "I" of the logo until it was changed in 1978. After then, the character would be occasionally revived, most notably during the 1980s and 1990s, a short-lived "Esky" award given to popular rock bands during the 2000s and during Jay Fielden's tenure in the 2010s.

Under [[Harold Hayes]], who ran it from 1961 to 1973, ''Esquire'' became as distinctive as its oversized pages''<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''It Wasn't Pretty, Folks, But Didn't We Have Fun? Esquire in the Sixties'' (1995).</ref>'', helping pioneer the trend of [[New Journalism]] by publishing such writers as [[Norman Mailer]], [[Tim O'Brien (author)|Tim O'Brien]], [[John Sack]], [[Gay Talese]], [[Tom Wolfe]], and [[Terry Southern]]. In the mid 1960s, ''Esquire'' partnered with [[Verve Records]] to release a series of "Sound Tour" vinyl LPs that provided advice and music for traveling abroad.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for hi-fi living : the vinyl LP in midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=269–280|oclc=958205262}}</ref> In August 1969, ''Esquire'' published [[Normand Poirier]]'s piece, "An American Atrocity", one of the first reports of American atrocities committed against Vietnamese civilians.<ref name="nytimes">[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/04/obituaries/normand-poirier.html "Normand Poirier"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. February 4, 1981</ref> Like many other magazines of the era, ''Esquire'' shrank from the traditional large-magazine format (about 10-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>"x13-<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>") to the smaller standard [[Letter (paper size)|8½×11]] inches in 1971.

[[File:Esquire cover Feb 1961.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of ''Esquire'' from February 1961]]

The magazine was sold by the original owners to [[Clay Felker]] in 1977 (although Esquire Inc. kept its name until its acquisition by [[Gulf + Western]] in 1983). Felker reinvented the magazine as a [[fortnight]]ly in 1978, under the title of ''Esquire Fortnightly'', ditching the script logo that had been used (with minor tweaks) since 1933. However, the fortnightly experiment proved to be a failure, and by the end of that year, the magazine lost [[United States dollar|US$]]5 million. Felker sold ''Esquire'' in 1979 to the 13-30 Corporation, a Tennessee-based publisher, which reverted the magazine into a monthly, beginning with the July issue (dated both as of July 3 and 19). During this time, ''[[New York Woman]]'' magazine was launched as something of a spin-off version of ''Esquire'' aimed at a female audience. In 1986, the 13-30 Corporation (renamed as the Esquire Magazine Group) launched the ''[[New York Woman]]'' magazine as something of a spin-off version of ''Esquire'' aimed at a female audience. The company split up at the end of the year, and ''Esquire'' was sold to [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]], with ''New York Woman'' going its separate way to American Express Publishing, being published until 1992.

The arrival of male-oriented lifestyle publications during the early 1990s and the problems of the magazine industry during the middle of the decade led to a sustained decline in circulation that threatened the future of ''Esquire'', which had relied upon an elegant, highly-literate audience (during the second half of the 1980s it published a year-end register featuring leading cultural figures under 40 years of age) but did not appeal to younger men. [[David M. Granger]] was named [[editor-in-chief]] of the magazine in June 1997, fresh from a six-year stint at ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]],'' which he turned around from its fashion-heavy tradition<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/business/media/editor-of-esquire-david-granger-steps-down.html|title=Editor of Esquire, David Granger, Steps Down|last=Victor|first=Daniel|date=2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 12, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Since his arrival, the magazine received numerous awards, including multiple National Magazine Awards. Its award-winning staff writers include [[Tom Chiarella]], [[Scott Raab]], [[Mike Sager]], Chris Jones, John H. Richardson, [[Cal Fussman]], [[Lisa Taddeo]], and [[Tom Junod]]. Famous photographers have also worked for the magazine, among which fashion photographer [[Gleb Derujinsky]], and [[Richard Avedon]]. In spite of its success, the magazine under Granger became increasingly criticized for its focus on the so-called metrosexual culture (a criticism he previously had late in his ''GQ'' tenure). David Granger stepped down in 2016, being replaced by Jay Fielden, who revamped the magazine into its more classical up-market style. At the same time, its political coverage became more comprehensive, following a trend among American magazine publications in general. After a series of shake-ups at Hearst's magazine division, Michael Sebastian became editor in mid-2019, reverting to its 2000s-era style.

In September 2006, the magazine launched a special style-focused issue entitled ''The Big Black Book'', which beginning in 2009 was published twice a year until the Spring/Summer issue ran for the last time in 2018.

In 2010, the June and July issues were merged as were the December and January issues in 2015, and in 2018 the magazine moved to eight issues per year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/business/media/esquires-editor-fielden-hearst-magazines.html|title=Esquire's Editor Is Out in Reshuffling at Hearst Magazines|last=Tracy|first=Marc|date=2019-05-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Blog==
In January 2009 ''Esquire'' launched a new blog—the ''Daily Endorsement Blog''. Each morning the editors of the magazine recommend one thing for readers' immediate enjoyment: "not a political candidate or position or party, but a breakthrough idea or product or Web site."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/endorsement/ |title=The Daily Endorsement - Thought of the Day - Things to Do When Bored |publisher=Esquire |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref> The concept of the "Daily Endorsement Blog" was said to have emerged from ''Esquire''{{'s}} November 2008 issue called the "Endorsement Issue", in which, after 75 years, ''Esquire'' publicly endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-granger/why-after-75-years-emesqu_b_133415.html?page=8 |title=David Granger: Why After 75 Years, Esquire Endorsed a Presidential Candidate |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref> The ''Daily Endorsement Blog'' was officially discontinued in April 2011.

==Fiction==
From 1969 to 1976, [[Gordon Lish]] served as fiction editor for ''Esquire'' and became known as "Captain Fiction" because of the authors whose careers he assisted. Lish helped establish the career of writer [[Raymond Carver]] by publishing his short stories in ''Esquire'', often over the objections of Hayes.<ref>For a description of Lish's years at ''Esquire'', see Carol Polsgrove, ''It Wasn't Pretty, Folks, But Didn't We Have Fun? Esquire in the Sixties'' (1995), pp. 239-249.</ref> Lish is noted for encouraging Carver's [[minimalism]] and publishing the short stories of [[Richard Ford]]. Using the influential publication as a vehicle to introduce new fiction by emerging authors, he promoted the work of such writers as [[T. Coraghessan Boyle]], [[Barry Hannah]], [[Cynthia Ozick]] and [[Reynolds Price]].

In February 1977, ''Esquire'' published "For Rupert – with no promises" as an unsigned work of fiction: this was the first time it had published a work without identifying the author. Readers speculated that it was the work of [[J. D. Salinger]], the reclusive author best known for ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''. Told in first-person, the story features events and Glass family names from the story "[[For Esmé – with Love and Squalor]]". [[Gordon Lish]] is quoted as saying, "I tried to borrow Salinger's voice and the psychological circumstances of his life, as I imagine them to be now. And I tried to use those things to elaborate on certain circumstances and events in his fiction to deepen them and add complexity."<ref>''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (February 25, 1977).</ref>

Other authors appearing in ''Esquire'' at that time included [[William F. Buckley]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Murray Kempton]], [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], [[Ron Rosenbaum]], [[Andrew Vachss]] and [[Garry Wills]].

During the mid-late 1980s, the magazine's June "Summer Reading" issues featured a full-length fiction story accompanied by shorter pieces, all written for the magazine.

Although the magazine greatly reduced its fiction content during the 1990s in line with most other magazines, it has nevertheless continued to publish fiction in occasion. Writer [[Elizabeth Gilbert]] debuted in ''Esquire'' in 1993, while [[Chris Adrian]], [[Nathan Englander]], [[Benjamin Percy]], and [[Patrick Somerville]] among others have also contributed to the magazine. Other writers who have recently appeared in ''Esquire'' include [[Ralph Lombreglia]], [[James Lee Burke]], and [[Stephen King]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Adam |url=http://www.esquire.com/fiction/ |title=Fiction |publisher=Esquire |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref>

===The Napkin Fiction Project===
In 2007 ''Esquire'' launched the Napkin Fiction Project, in which 250 cocktail napkins were mailed to writers all over the country by the incoming fiction editor, in a playful attempt to revive short fiction—"some with a half dozen books to their name, others just finishing their first."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/fiction/napkin-project/ |title=Beautiful Women, Men's Fashion, Best Music, Drink Recipes |publisher=Esquire |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref> In return, the magazine received nearly a hundred stories. [[Rick Moody]], [[Jonathan Ames]], [[Bret Anthony Johnston]], [[Joshua Ferris]], [[Yiyun Li]], [[Aimee Bender]], and [[ZZ Packer]] are among the notable writers included.

==Dubious Achievement Awards==
For many years, ''Esquire'' has published its annual ''Dubious Achievement Awards'', lampooning events of the preceding year. As a [[running gag]], the annual article almost always displayed an old photo of [[Richard Nixon]] laughing, with the caption, "Why is this man laughing?" However, the February 2006 "Dubious Achievement Awards" used the caption under a photo of [[W. Mark Felt]], the former FBI official revealed in 2005 to be "[[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]", the source for [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] to uncover the [[Watergate scandal]]. The magazine did continue the Nixon photo in February 2007, referring to a poll stating that [[George W. Bush]] had surpassed Nixon as the "worst president ever".

A popular running gag featured in the "Dubious Achievements of 1990" edition involved especially egregious achievements headlined with "And then they went to [[Elaine's]].", referring to a popular restaurant in New York City that closed in May 2011.

''Esquire'' did not publish "Dubious Achievement Awards" for 2001, but resumed them with the 2002 awards, published in the February 2003 issue.

"Dubious Achievement Awards" were discontinued in 2008, according to an editor's note in the January 2008 issue, considering that the overabundance of imitators had made the feature superfluous.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/2008/beloved-esquire-franchise-dubious-achievements-becomes-one|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018043654/http://www.observer.com/2008/beloved-esquire-franchise-dubious-achievements-becomes-one|url-status=dead|title=The New York Observer|archive-date=October 18, 2008|accessdate=August 7, 2020}}</ref> However, after a nine-year hiatus, the feature was revived in the January 2017 issue with a skewering of 2016 events.

==Sexiest Woman Alive==
{{See also|People (magazine)#Sexiest Man Alive|l1=Sexiest Man Alive}}

The annual '''Sexiest Woman Alive''' feature ran between 2003 and 2015, billed as a benchmark of female attractiveness.

Originally, it was a part of the "Women We Love" issue that had appeared yearly since 1988 (after being a section of "The Passions of Men" issue, June 1987), being initially titled "Woman of the Year". To build interest, the magazine would do a tease, releasing partial images of the woman in the issues preceding the November issue. By 2007, it had become the dominating story of the issue and to create an element of surprise the hints were abandoned.
