''Bahrayn'' is the [[dual form]] of Arabic ''bahr'' ("sea"), so ''al-Bahrayn'' originally means "the two seas". However, the name has been lexicalised as a feminine [[proper noun]] and does not follow the grammatical rules for duals; thus its form is always ''Bahrayn'' and never ''Bahrān'', the expected [[nominative]] form. Endings are added to the word with no changes, as in the name of the national anthem ''Bahraynunā'' ("our Bahrain") or the [[demonym]] ''Bahraynī''. The medieval grammarian [[Ismail ibn Hammad al-Jawhari|al-Jawahari]] commented on this saying that the more formally correct term ''Bahrī'' (lit. "belonging to the sea") would have been misunderstood and so was unused.<ref name="Faroughy"/>{{Page needed|date=November 2020}}

It remains disputed which "two seas" the name ''Bahrayn'' originally refers to.<ref name="EoI"/> The term appears five times in the [[Quran]], but does not refer to the modern island—originally known to the Arabs as ''Awal''—but, rather, to all of Eastern Arabia (most notably [[al-Katif]] and [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|al-Hasa]]).<ref name="EoI">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Houtsma |first=M.

Until the late [[Middle Ages]], "Bahrain" referred to the [[Eastern Arabia|region of Eastern Arabia]] that included Southern Iraq, Kuwait, Al-Hasa, Qatif, and Bahrain. The region stretched from [[Basra]] in Iraq to the [[Strait of Hormuz]] in [[Oman]]. This was Iqlīm al-Bahrayn's "Bahrayn Province". The exact date at which the term "Bahrain" began to refer solely to the Awal archipelago is unknown.<ref name=Rentz/> The entire [[coastal strip]] of Eastern Arabia was known as "Bahrain" for a millennium.<ref name="maj">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC&pg=PR16|title=Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary|work=Clive Holes|year=2001|pages=XIX|isbn=9004107630|last1=Holes|first1=Clive}}</ref> The island and kingdom were also commonly spelled '''Bahrein'''{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} into the 1950s.

Bahrain was home to [[Dilmun]], an important [[Bronze Age]] trade centre linking [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1192 |title=Qal'at al-Bahrain – Ancient Harbour and Capital of Dilmun |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=5 October 2012}}</ref> Bahrain was later ruled by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarchaeology of an Ancient Society |last=Larsen |first=Curtis E. |year=1984 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-46906-5 |pages=52–55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q65mRSPPU6UC&pg=PA52}}</ref>

From the sixth to third century BC, Bahrain was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. By about 250 BC, [[Parthia]] brought the Persian Gulf under its control and extended its influence as far as Oman. The Parthians established garrisons along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf to control trade routes.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Federal Research Division|year=2004 |title=Bahrain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OsSPaxEpUS4C

During the [[classical era]], Bahrain was referred to by the [[ancient Greek]]s as ''[[Tylos]]'', the centre of pearl trading, when the Greek admiral [[Nearchus]] serving under [[Alexander the Great]] landed on Bahrain.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=13}} Nearchus is believed to have been the first of Alexander's commanders to visit the island, and he found a verdant land that was part of a wide trading network; he recorded: "That on the island of Tylos, situated in the Persian Gulf, are large plantations of cotton trees, from which are manufactured clothes called ''sindones'', of strongly differing degrees of value, some being costly, others less expensive. The use of these is not confined to India, but extends to Arabia."<ref>Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren, Historical Researches Into the Politics, Intercourse, and Trade of the Principal Nations of Antiquity, Henry Bohn, 1854 p38</ref> The Greek historian [[Theophrastus]] states that much of Bahrain was covered by these cotton trees and that Bahrain was famous for exporting walking canes engraved with emblems that were customarily carried in Babylon.<ref>Arnold Heeren, ibid, p441</ref>

Alexander had planned to settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] was in everyday use), while [[Zeus]] was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams.<ref>Phillip Ward, Bahrain: A Travel Guide, Oleander Press p68</ref> Bahrain even became the site of Greek athletic contests.<ref>W. B. Fisher et al. The Cambridge History of Iran, Cambridge University Press 1968 p40</ref>

The Greek historian [[Strabo]] believed the [[Phoenicians]] originated from Bahrain.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ju. B. Tsirkin|title=Canaan. Phoenicia.

The name Tylos is thought to be a Hellenisation of the Semitic ''Tilmun'' (from [[Dilmun]]).<ref>Jean Francois Salles in Traces of Paradise: The Archaeology of Bahrain, 2500BC-300AD in Michael Rice, Harriet Crawford Ed, IB Tauris, 2002 p132</ref> The term Tylos was commonly used for the islands until [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' when the inhabitants are referred to as Thilouanoi.<ref name="Jean Francois Salles p132">Jean Francois Salles p132</ref>{{Title missing}} Some place names in Bahrain go back to the Tylos era; for instance the name of Arad, a residential suburb of [[Muharraq]], is believed to originate from "Arados", the ancient Greek name for Muharraq.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=13}}

In the 3rd century, [[Ardashir I]], the first ruler of the [[Sassanid dynasty]], marched on Oman and Bahrain, where he defeated Sanatruq the ruler of Bahrain.<ref name="books.google">{{cite book |title=Arabia and the Arabs: From the Bronze Age to the Coming of Islam |last=Hoyland |first=Robert G. |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-19535-5 |page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZb9g1tSeXYC&pg=PA28}}</ref> At this time, Bahrain was known as [[Mishmahig]] (which in [[Pahlavi language|Middle-Persian/Pahlavi]] means "ewe-fish").<ref>Yoma 77a and Rosh Hashbanah, 23a</ref>{{Title missing}}

Bahrain was also the site of worship of an ox deity called [[Awal]]. Worshipers built a large statue to [[Awal]] in [[Muharraq]], although it has now been lost. For many centuries after ''Tylos'', Bahrain was known as ''[[Awal]]''. By the 5th century, Bahrain became a centre for [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christianity]], with the village [[Samahij]]<ref>From Persian sa-mahij (سه ماهی) meaning Three Fish.</ref> as the seat of bishops. In 410, according to the Oriental Syriac Church synodal records, a bishop named Batai was excommunicated from the church in Bahrain.<ref name="Jean Francois Salles p132"/> As a sect, the Nestorians were often persecuted as heretics by the [[Byzantine Empire]], but Bahrain was outside the Empire's control, offering some safety. The names of several [[Muharraq]] villages today reflect Bahrain's Christian legacy, with [[Al Dair]] meaning "the monastery".

===Middle Ages===
In 899, the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] Muslim sect, seized Bahrain, seeking to create a [[utopia]]n society based on reason and redistribution of property among initiates. Thereafter, the Qarmatians demanded [[tribute]] from the caliph in [[Baghdad]], and in 930 sacked [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], bringing the sacred [[Black Stone]] back to their base in [[Bahrain (historical region)|Ahsa]], in medieval Bahrain, for ransom. According to historian [[Al-Juwayni]], the stone was returned 22 years later in 951 under mysterious circumstances. Wrapped in a sack, it was thrown into the [[Great Mosque of Kufa]] in Iraq, accompanied by a note saying "By command we took it, and by command we have brought it back." The theft and removal of the Black Stone caused it to break into seven pieces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/islam/shia/qarma.html |title=Qarmatiyyah |publisher=St. Martin's College |work=Overview of World Religions |access-date=4 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428055134/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/islam/shia/qarma.html |archive-date=28 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="glasse">Cyril Glasse, ''New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 245.

In 1860, the Al Khalifas used the same tactic when the British tried to overpower Bahrain. Writing letters to the Persians and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s, Al Khalifas agreed to place Bahrain under the latter's protection in March due to offering better conditions.

Unrest amongst the people of Bahrain began when Britain officially established complete dominance over the territory in 1892. The first revolt and widespread uprising took place in March 1895 against Sheikh Issa bin Ali, then ruler of Bahrain.{{sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh | 1999 | p=130}} Sheikh Issa was the first of the Al Khalifa to rule without Persian relations. [[Arnold Wilson|Sir Arnold Wilson]], Britain's representative in the Persian Gulf and author of ''The Persian Gulf'', arrived in Bahrain from Muscat at this time.{{sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh | 1999 | p=130}} The uprising developed further with some protesters killed by British forces.{{sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh | 1999 | p=130}}

Before the development of petroleum, the island was largely devoted to [[Pearl hunting|pearl fisheries]] and, as late as the 19th century, was considered to be the finest in the world.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} In 1903, German explorer, [[Hermann Burchardt]], visited Bahrain and took many photographs of historical sites, including the old ''Qaṣr es-Sheikh'', photos now stored at the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]].<ref>[http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=625685&bt=europeanaapi The old Qaṣr es-Sheikh] (click on photo to enlarge).</ref> Prior to the [[World War I|First World War]], there were about 400 vessels hunting pearls and an annual export of more than £30,000.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

In 1911, a group of Bahraini merchants demanded restrictions on the British influence in the country. The group's leaders were subsequently arrested and exiled to India. In 1923, the British introduced [[Bahrain administrative reforms of the 1920s|administrative reforms]] and replaced Sheikh Issa bin Ali with his son.

About 92% of Bahrain is desert with periodic droughts and dust storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis.<ref name=TR/> Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification resulting from the degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, [[coral reef]]s, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as [[Tubli Bay]]. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its [[Soil salinity|salinisation]] by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified the locations of the sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of [[sabkha]] water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.<ref>{{Cite book

More than 330 species of birds were recorded in the Bahrain archipelago, 26 species of which breed in the country. Millions of migratory birds pass through the Persian Gulf region in the winter and autumn months.<ref name=Fuller/> One globally endangered species, ''[[Houbara bustard|Chlamydotis undulata]]'', is a regular migrant in the autumn.<ref name=Fuller/> The many islands and shallow seas of Bahrain are globally important for the breeding of the [[Socotra cormorant]]; up to 100,000 pairs of these birds were recorded over the Hawar islands.<ref name=Fuller/>  Bahrain's national bird is the [[bulbul]] while its national animal is the [[Arabian oryx]]. And the national flower of Bahrain is the beloved Deena.

Only 18 species of mammals are found in Bahrain, animals such as [[gazelle]]s, desert rabbits and [[hedgehog]]s are common in the wild but the [[Arabian oryx]] was hunted to [[extinction]] on the island.<ref name=Fuller/> Twenty-five species of [[amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s were recorded as well as 21 species of [[Butterfly|butterflies]] and 307 species of [[flora]].<ref name=Fuller>{{Cite book|title=Towards a Bahrain National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity|year=2005|publisher=Fuller & Associates|pages=22, 23, 28|url=http://www.fuller-imc.com/images/Bahrain%20CBD%20Final%20Report.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117000005/http://www.fuller-imc.com/images/Bahrain%20CBD%20Final%20Report.pdf|archive-date=17 January 2013}}</ref> The marine [[biotope]]s are diverse and include extensive [[sea grass]] beds and [[mudflats]], patchy [[coral reef]]s as well as offshore islands.

The Hawar Islands Protected Area provides valuable feeding and breeding grounds for a variety of migratory seabirds, it is an internationally recognised site for [[bird migration]]. The breeding colony of [[Socotra cormorant]] on Hawar Islands is the largest in the world, and the dugongs foraging around the archipelago form the second-largest dugong aggregation after Australia.<ref name=CBD>{{cite web|title=Country profile: Bahrain|url=http://www.cbd.int/countries/profile.shtml?country=bh#status|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity|access-date=24 June 2012}}</ref>

*[[Hawar Islands]]
*Mashtan Island, off the coast of Bahrain.
*[[Arad, Bahrain|Arad]] bay, in Muharraq.
*[[Tubli Bay]]
*[[Al Areen Wildlife Park]], which is a zoo and a breeding centre for [[endangered species|endangered animals]], is the only protected area on land and also the only protected area which is managed on a day-to-day basis.<ref name=Fuller/>

[[File:Hamad-Bin-Isa-Al-Khalifa.jpg|thumb|right|Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, the King of Bahrain]]

Bahrain under the Al-Khalifa is a [[constitutional monarchy]] headed by the [[King of Bahrain|King]], [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]]. King Hamad enjoys wide executive powers which include appointing the [[Prime Minister of Bahrain|Prime Minister]] and his [[Cabinet of Bahrain|ministers]], commanding the [[Bahrain Defence Force|army]], chairing the [[Judiciary of Bahrain|Higher Judicial Council]], appointing the [[National Assembly (Bahrain)|parliament]]'s [[Consultative Council (Bahrain)|upper house]] and dissolving its elected [[Council of Representatives (Bahrain)|lower house]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=23 November 2011|title=BICI {{!}} Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry|url=http://www.bici.org.bh/|access-date=2020-11-22|website=www.bici.org.bh|page=15}}</ref> The head of government is the prime minister.

Bahrain has a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] National Assembly (''al-Jam'iyyah al-Watani'') consisting of the Shura Council (''Majlis Al-Shura'') with 40 seats and the Council of Representatives (''Majlis Al-Nuwab'') with 40 seats. The forty members of the Shura are appointed by the king. In the Council of Representatives, 40 members are elected by absolute majority vote in single-member constituencies to serve four-year terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionguide.org/country.php?ID=18|title=Bahrain|date=26 July 2010|publisher=[[International Foundation for Electoral Systems]]|access-date=22 March 2011}}</ref> The appointed council "exercises a ''de facto'' veto" over the elected, because draft acts must be approved so they may pass into law. After approval, the king may ratify and issue the act or return it within six months to the National Assembly where it may only pass into law if approved by two thirds of both councils.<ref name=":2" />

In 1973, the country held its first [[Bahraini general election, 1973|parliamentary elections]]; however, two years later, the [[Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa|late emir]] dissolved the parliament and suspended the [[Constitution of Bahrain#Constitution of 1973|constitution]] after parliament rejected the [[State Security Law in Bahrain|State Security Law]].<ref name="BBC 11.5.2012">[[Adam Curtis|Curtis, Adam]] (11 May 2012).

===Media===
The predominant forms of media in Bahrain consists of weekly and daily newspapers, television, and radio.

Newspapers are widely available in multiple languages such as Arabic, English, Malayalam, etc. to support the varied population. ''[[Akhbar Al Khaleej]]'' (أخبار الخليج) and ''[[Al Ayam (Bahrain)|Al Ayam]]'' (الأيام) are examples of major Arabic newspapers published daily. ''[[Gulf Daily News]]'' and ''[[Daily Tribune (Bahrain)|Daily Tribune]]'' publish daily newspapers in English. ''[[Gulf Madhyamam]]'' is a newspaper published in Malayalam.

The country's television network operates over 5 networks, all of which are by the [[Information Affairs Authority]]. Radio, much like the television network, is mostly state-run and usually in Arabic. ''Radio Bahrain'' is a long-running English language radio station and ''Your FM'' is a radio station serving the large expatriate population from the Indian Subcontinent living in the country.

By June 2012, Bahrain had 961,000 internet users.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|title=Bahrain profile – Media|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14541053|access-date=15 June 2014}}</ref> The platform "provides a welcome free space for journalists, although one that is increasingly monitored", according to [[Reporters Without Borders]]. Rigorous filtering targets political, human rights, religious material and content deemed obscene. Bloggers and other [[netizens]] were among those detained during protests in 2011.<ref name="ReferenceB" />

Bahraini journalists risk prosecution for offenses which include "undermining" the government and religion. [[Self-censorship]] is widespread. Journalists were targeted by officials during anti-government protests in 2011. Three editors from opposition daily [[Al-Wasat (Bahraini newspaper)|''Al-Wasat'']] were sacked and later fined for publishing "false" news. Several foreign correspondents were expelled.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14541053 | work=BBC News | title=Bahrain profile | date=29 January 2013}}</ref> An independent commission, set up to look into the unrest, found that state media coverage was at times inflammatory. It said opposition groups suffered from lack of access to mainstream media, and recommended that the government "consider relaxing censorship". Bahrain will host the Saudi-financed [[Alarab News Channel]], expected to launch in December 2012. It will be based at a planned "Media City". An opposition satellite station, [[LuaLua TV]], operates from London but has found its signals blocked.<ref name="ReferenceB" />

Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf crisis of 1990–91]]. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain is home to a number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects.

Bahrain has a well-developed [[Road transport in Bahrain|road network]], particularly in Manama.

==Science and technology==

=== Policy framework ===
The ''Bahraini Economic Vision 2030'' published in 2008 does not indicate how the stated goal of shifting from an economy built on oil wealth to a productive, globally competitive economy will be attained. Bahrain has already diversified its exports to some extent, out of necessity. It has the smallest hydrocarbon reserves of any Persian Gulf state, producing 48,000 barrels per day from its one onshore field.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Salacanin|first=S.|date=February 2015|title=Oil and gas reserves: how long will they last?|journal=Bq Magazine}}</ref> The bulk of the country's revenue comes from its share in the offshore field administered by Saudi Arabia. The gas reserve in Bahrain is expected to last for less than 27 years, leaving the country with few sources of capital to pursue the development of new industries. Investment in research and development remained very low in 2013.<ref name=":0" />

Apart from the Ministry of Education and the Higher Education Council, the two main hives of activity in science, technology, and innovation are the University of Bahrain (established in 1986) and the Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International, and Energy Studies. The latter was founded in 2009 to undertake research with a focus on strategic security and energy issues to encourage new thinking and influence policy-making.<ref name=":0" />

=== New infrastructure for science and education ===
Bahrain hopes to build a science culture within the kingdom and to encourage technological innovation, among other goals. In 2013, the Bahrain Science Centre was launched as an interactive educational facility targeting 6–18-year olds. The topics covered by current exhibitions include junior engineering, human health, the five senses, Earth sciences and biodiversity.<ref name=":0" />

In April 2014, Bahrain launched its National Space Science Agency. The agency has been working to ratify international space-related agreements such as the Outer Space Treaty, the Rescue Agreement, the Space Liability Convention, the Registration Convention and the Moon Agreement. The agency plans to establish infrastructure for the observation of both outer space and the Earth.<ref name=":0" />

In November 2008, an agreement was signed to establish a Regional Centre for Information and Communication Technology in Manama under the auspices of UNESCO. The aim is to establish a knowledge hub for the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. In March 2012, the centre hosted two high-level workshops on ICTs and education. In 2013, Bahrain topped the Arab world for internet penetration (90% of the population), trailed by the United Arab Emirates (86%) and Qatar (85%). Just half of Bahrainis and Qataris (53%) and two-thirds of those in the United Arab Emirates (64%) had access in 2009.<ref name=":0" />

=== Investment in education and research ===
In 2012, the government devoted 2.6% of GDP to education, one of the lowest ratios in the Arab world. This ratio was on a par with investment in education in Lebanon and higher only than that in Qatar (2.4% in 2008) and Sudan (2.2% in 2009).<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris}}</ref>

Bahrain invests little in research and development. In 2009 and 2013, this investment reportedly amounted to 0.04% of GDP, although the data were incomplete, covering only the higher education sector. The lack of comprehensive data on research and development poses a challenge for policy-makers, as data inform evidence-based policy-making.<ref name=":0" />

The available data for researchers in 2013 only cover the higher education sector. Here, the number of researchers is equivalent to 50 per million inhabitants, compared to a global average for all employment sectors of 1,083 per million.<ref name=":0" />

The University of Bahrain had over 20,000 students in 2014, 65% of whom are women, and around 900 faculty members, 40% of whom are women. From 1986 to 2014, university staff published 5 500 papers and books. The university spent about US$11 million per year on research in 2014, which was conducted by a contingent of 172 men and 128 women. Women thus made up 43% of researchers at the University of Bahrain in 2014.<ref name=":0" />

Bahrain was one of 11 Arab states which counted a majority of female university graduates in science and engineering in 2014. Women accounted for 66% of graduates in natural sciences, 28% of those in engineering and 77% of those in health and welfare. It is harder to judge the contribution of women to research, as the data for 2013 only cover the higher education sector.<ref name=":0" />

=== Trends in research output ===
In 2014, Bahraini scientists published 155 articles in internationally cataloged journals, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). This corresponds to 15 articles per million inhabitants, compared to a global average of 176 per million inhabitants in 2013. Scientific output has risen slowly from 93 articles in 2005 and remains modest. By 2014, only Mauritania and Palestine had a smaller output in this database among Arab states.<ref name=":0" />

Between 2008 and 2014, Bahraini scientists collaborated most with their peers from Saudi Arabia (137 articles), followed by Egypt (101), the United Kingdom (93), the United States (89) and Tunisia (75).<ref name=":0" />

The Shia Bahrainis are [[Baharna]] (Arab), and the [[Ajam of Bahrain|Ajam]] are [[Iranian people|Persian]] Shias. Shia Persians form large communities in Manama and Muharraq. A small minority of Shia Bahrainis are ethnic Hasawis from [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]].

Sunni Bahrainis are mainly divided into two main ethnic groups: Arabs (al Arab) and [[Huwala]]. Sunni Arabs, while a minority, are the most influential ethnic group in Bahrain. They hold most government positions and the [[Al Khalifa|Bahraini monarchy]] are Sunni Arabs. Sunni Arabs have traditionally lived in areas such as Zallaq, Muharraq, Riffa and Hawar islands. The Huwala are descendants of Sunni Iranians; some of them are Sunni Persians,<ref name=mig>{{cite web |url=https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/730/1/Taqi10.pdf |title=Two ethnicities, three generations: Phonological variation and change in Kuwait |work=[[Newcastle University]] |year=2010 |page=11 |access-date=20 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019130212/https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/730/1/Taqi10.pdf |archive-date=19 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC&pg=PA135 Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary].

At the beginning of the 20th century, Qur'anic schools (''[[Kuttab]]'') were the only form of education in Bahrain.<ref name=MoE/> They were traditional schools aimed at teaching children and youth the reading of the [[Qur'an]]. After [[World War I]], Bahrain became open to western influences, and a demand for modern educational institutions appeared. 1919 marked the beginning of modern public school system in Bahrain when the [[Al-Hidaya Al-Khalifia School]] for boys opened in [[Muharraq]].<ref name=MoE/> In 1926, the Education Committee opened the second public school for boys in [[Manama]], and in 1928 the first public school for girls was opened in Muharraq.<ref name=MoE>{{cite web|title=History of Education in Bahrain |url=http://www.moe.gov.bh/en/history/Index.aspx |publisher=Ministry of Education, Bahrain |access-date=28 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118203321/http://www.moe.gov.bh/en/history/Index.aspx |archive-date=18 January 2013 }}</ref> {{As of|2011}}, there are a total of 126,981 students studying in public schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistics for the academic year 2011/2012|url=http://www.moe.gov.bh/archive/statistics/2011/st_class_gov.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Education, Bahrain|access-date=28 June 2012}}</ref>
