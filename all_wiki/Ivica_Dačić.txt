Dačić graduated from the [[University of Belgrade]] in 1989 and joined the Socialist Party in 1991.

Following the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milošević]], Dačić became a member of the main board, and became party leader in 2006. Like his predecessor Slobodan Milošević, he is regarded as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatic]] leader willing to change views based on circumstance and has worked to reform the party. The [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] is currently in a coalition with the conservative populist [[Serbian Progressive Party]] (SNS). Commentators describe his political positions as [[nationalism|nationalist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.021.rs/story/Info/Srbija/45148/Dacic-Tadic-i-Nikolic-su-evrofanatici-ja-sam-nacionalista.html|title=Dačić: Tadić i Nikolić su evrofanatici, ja sam nacionalista|publisher=021.rs|accessdate=8 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=BBC-Profile>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19017144|publisher=BBC|title=Profile: Prime Minister Ivica Dacic of Serbia|date=27 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/enlargement/142875|title=Tensions mount over Kosovo-Serbia deal|publisher=EUobserver|accessdate=8 January 2019}}</ref>

The [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|DS]]-led coalition that included Dačić's party reached an [[Future enlargement of the European Union#Recognised candidates|EU candidate]] status.

On 17 February 2008, the [[Assembly of Kosovo]] [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence]].<ref name="bbc_proclaim">"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7249034.stm Kosovo MPs proclaim independence]", BBC News, 17 February 2008</ref> It was the second declaration of independence by Kosovo's [[Albanian people|Albanian]]-majority political institutions, the first having been proclaimed on 7 September 1990.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Clark|title=Civil Resistance in Kosovo| date=August 2000| publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1569-0|page=73}}</ref> The legality of the declaration, and indeed whether it was an act of the Assembly, was disputed by the government of Serbia. Serbia sought international validation and support for its stance, and in October 2008 Serbia requested [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence|an advisory opinion on the matter]] from the [[International Court of Justice]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8004622.stm|work=BBC News|title=Serbian president visits Kosovo|date=17 April 2009| accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref> The Court determined that the declaration of independence was legal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/16012.pdf?PHPSESSID=b0b24a6135eaf2347d5b0a0badec77ff|title=Press Release: Accordance with international law of the unilateral declaration of independence in respect of Kosovo: Advisory Opinion|date=22 July 2010|accessdate=4 August 2010|publisher=International Court of Justice|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807010647/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/16012.pdf?PHPSESSID=fd67c1c1a61d2a99cf11356e050236bb|archivedate=7 August 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2006, upon being elected party leader, Dačić said that he had no problem fighting for Kosovo as he had done it before.<ref name=BBC-Profile/> Although the recognition of Kosovo by Serbia might not be a requirement for Serbia's EU accession,<ref name=BBC-Profile/> the EU opposes any [[partition of Kosovo]] into ethnic entities.<ref name=BBC-Profile/> In May 2011, he said that partition of Kosovo would be the "only realistic solution".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=05&dd=15&nav_id=74342|title=Partition of Kosovo only solution, minister says|date=15 April 2011|work=B92|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516154348/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=05&dd=15&nav_id=74342|archivedate=16 May 2011}}</ref>

On 25 July 2011, the [[North Kosovo crisis]] began when the [[Kosovo Police]] crossed into the [[Assembly of the Community of Municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Serb-controlled municipalities]] of [[North Kosovo]], in an attempt to control several border crossings without the consultation of either Serbia or [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]/[[EULEX]].<ref name="Kosovo special police">{{cite news|author=Mark Lowen|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14303165|title=Kosovo tense after deadly clash on Serbian border|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 July 2011|date=27 July 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110728181514/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14303165|archivedate= 28 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Kosovo-Serbia-Border-Row-Nato-Intervenes-After-Police-Try-To-Take-Over-Border-Control-Posts/Article/201107416038032?lpos=World_News_Second_World_News_Article_Teaser_Region_1&lid=ARTICLE_16038032_Kosovo-Serbia_Border_Row%3A_Nato_Intervenes_After_Police_Try_To_Take_Over_Border_Control_Posts|title=Nato Steps in Amid Kosovo-Serbia Border Row|date=July 2011|publisher=Sky News}}</ref> Though tensions between the two sides eased somewhat after the intervention of [[NATO]]'s KFOR forces, they continued to remain high amid concern from the EU, who also blamed Kosovo for the unilateral provocation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/07/20117275833470595.html|title=EU criticises Kosovo police operation|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref>

On 24 November 2011, Dačić said that he saw the Republic of Kosovo's incident with Serbs in North Kosovo as an attack on Serbia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ivica Dačić: Zbog Kosova ako treba i rat|url=http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/188682/Ivica+Da%C4%8Di%C4%87%3A+Zbog+Kosova+ako+treba+i+rat.html|date=24 November 2011|work=Press Online}}</ref> The [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] claimed the "nationalist" leanings of Kosovo-born Dačić raise speculation on the policy towards the Kosovo issue, which may implicate on Serbia's EU application.<ref name=BBC-Profile/>

Dačić's stance has since dramatically changed; in February 2013 he met [[Hashim Thaçi]], the [[Prime Minister of Kosovo]], in [[Brussels]] for the most important in a series of talks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/02/kosovos-recent-past|accessdate=18 February 2013|title=Kosovo's recent past: The Kosovo memory book|work=[[The Economist]]|date=18 February 2013}}</ref> On 19 April 2013, Dačić and his government took another step towards normalizing relations between Kosovo and Serbia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/19/us-serbia-kosovo-eu-idUSBRE93I0IB20130419 | work=Reuters | title=EU brokers historic Kosovo deal, door opens to Serbia accession|date=19 April 2013}}</ref> In March 2013, Dačić said that while his government would never recognise Kosovo's independence, "lies were told that Kosovo is ours" and that Serbia needed to define its "real borders".<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/07/us-serbia-kosovo-idUSBRE9260I520130307 Serbs lied to that "Kosovo is ours:" Serbian PM], Reuters.com, 7 March 2013.</ref>

==Protege of Slobodan Milošević==
Because he was a high-profile spokesman for Milošević, he received the nickname "Little Sloba" after his mentor.<ref name=Chicago-Tribune>{{citation|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-27/business/sns-rt-serbia-governmentdacic-newsmakerl6e8iih1j-20120727_1_late-serb-strongman-serbia-ivica-dacic|title="We've changed": New Serb PM is ex-aide to Milosevic|date=27 July 2012 | work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref><ref name=BBC-Profile/> Dačić said that the Socialist Party he inherited from Milošević made mistakes, but he still revered Milošević.<ref name=Chicago-Tribune/> He said, regarding his history with Milošević: "The past is of no interest to me because I cannot change it but we can do something to change our country's future."<ref name=BBC-Profile />

Nenad Sebek, executive director of the Centre for Reconciliation and Democracy think-tank said "Dačić is one of the most intelligent and cunning politicians in Serbia [...] Without ever saying sorry for what his party did during the
1990s under Milošević, Dačić single-handedly returned the Socialists to the political mainstream in Serbia."<ref name=Chicago-Tribune/> Sebek continued: "He is extremely smart and likely to be very cooperative when negotiating with the international community, but he's still an eyesore for anyone who doesn't have the memory of a goldfish."<ref name=Chicago-Tribune/>

The EU had earlier listed Dačić among persons in Milošević's circle prohibited from entering the EU.<ref name=Dacic-24sata/>{{when|date=August 2012}}
