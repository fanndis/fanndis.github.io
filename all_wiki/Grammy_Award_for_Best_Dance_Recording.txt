The '''Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording''' is an award presented at the [[Grammy Award]]s, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards,<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=April 24, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309064412/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/factsheets/env-grammy_awards_info%2C0%2C5838827.htmlstory|archive-date=March 9, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> to recording artists for works containing quality vocal performances in the [[dance music]] genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".<ref name=Overview>{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/ |title=Overview |accessdate=April 24, 2010 |publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103173212/http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/ |archivedate=January 3, 2011 }}</ref>

The award for Best Dance Recording was first presented to [[Donna Summer]] and [[Giorgio Moroder]] in 1998 for the song "Carry On". In 2003, the Academy moved the category from the "Pop" field into a new "Dance" field, which currently contains the category [[Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album|Best Dance/Electronic Album]] as well.<ref name=Billboard>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Q8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA37|title=Beat Box|first=Michael|last=Paoletta|page=37|date=February 1, 2003|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=June 25, 2010|quote=For the first time, the best dance recording category is broken out into its own dance field.

The award goes to the artist, producer and mixer. The engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificate.<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/sites/com/files/bluebook_awards_certs_and_grammy_tickets.pdf]</ref>

[[Skrillex]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Diplo]] and [[The Chemical Brothers]] are the only artists to win the award more than once, having won three, two and two times, respectively. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[The Chemical Brothers]] share the record for the most nominations, with five. [[Gloria Estefan]] holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with three.

==History==
Though she was not the first to suggest that the genre be recognized officially, Ellyn Harris and her Committee for the Advancement of Dance Music lobbied for more than two years to encourage the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to acknowledge dance music.<ref name=SunJournal>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5-AgAAAAIBAJ&pg=1300,3595005&dq|title=Grammys finally realize dance music will survive|date=February 23, 1998|accessdate=July 22, 2010|work=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Sun Journal]]|publisher=Sun Media Group|location=Lewiston, Maine}}</ref> Some Academy members debated whether dance music, with its heavy use of layering, [[remix]]ing, "lack of melody or verse", and numerous [[List of electronic music genres|varieties]], was truly considered music. Others were concerned that dance music was not a long-lasting genre, fearing the category would face retirement much like the award for [[Grammy Award for Best Disco Recording|Best Disco Recording]], which was presented for one year only at the [[22nd Grammy Awards]] in 1980.<ref name=SunJournal/>

In 1998, Harris' efforts paid off when the Academy first presented the award to Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder at the [[40th Grammy Awards]] for the song "Carry On". While the Academy had once been quoted as saying that "they considered dance music as something pop artists had created in their most frivolous moments", Ivan Bernstein, executive director of the organization's Florida branch, insisted that an award for excellence in dance music would not exist "if there were concerns about excellence".<ref name=SunJournal/>
