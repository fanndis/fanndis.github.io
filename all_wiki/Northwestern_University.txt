==History==
{{Main|History of Northwestern University}}

The foundation of Northwestern University can be traced to a meeting on May 31, 1850, of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders, and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had been known from 1787 to 1803 as the [[Northwest Territory]]. On January 28, 1851, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] granted a charter to the ''Trustees of the North-Western University'', making it the first chartered university in Illinois.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp= 5–6}}</ref><ref name="Charter">{{cite web |title= The Northwestern University Charter and Amendments |url= http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/nu_charter.pdf |access-date= August 5, 2007 |publisher= Northwestern University}}</ref> The school's nine founders, all of whom were Methodists (three of them [[Elder (Methodism)|ministers]]), knelt in [[Prayer in Christianity|prayer]] and [[Christian worship|worship]] before launching their first organizational meeting.<ref name="Northwestern">{{cite web |url= http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/northwestern/summer2002/features/coverstory/index.htm |title= Keeping the Faith |publisher= Northwestern |quote= Northwestern's own religious identity stretches back to its genesis. The University began with a prayer&nbsp;— the school's nine founders (all of them Methodists, three of them ministers) knelt in worship before launching their first organizational meeting. During that meeting, they agreed to establish a university under the patronage of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Through most of its history, Northwestern kept a strong Methodist tie. Regional church conferences chose a member of the board of trustees, and until 1890 every University president was an ordained Methodist minister. | access-date = July 20, 2007}}</ref> Although they affiliated the university with the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], they favored a [[non-sectarian]] admissions policy, believing that Northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory by bettering the economy in Evanston.<ref name="Planning a university">{{cite web|url= http://www.nu150.northwestern.edu/news/stories/10_21_00_founders.html |title= Planning a university to serve the Northwest Territory|quote= Although the founders were strong Methodists — three of them were Methodist ministers and before the meeting all those in attendance joined in prayer — they also firmly believed that Northwestern should be institution that would serve all people.

Northwestern admitted its first female students in 1869, and the first woman was graduated in 1874.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp=23–28}}</ref>

Northwestern fielded its first intercollegiate football team in 1882, later becoming a founding member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. In the 1870s and 1880s, Northwestern affiliated itself with already existing schools of law, medicine, and dentistry in Chicago. [[Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law]] is the oldest law school in Chicago. As the university increased in wealth and distinction, and enrollments grew, these professional schools were integrated with the undergraduate college in Evanston; the result was a modern research-university combining professional, graduate, and undergraduate programs, which gave equal weight to teaching and to research.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp= 83–84,110}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= Northwestern Undergraduate Catalog 2005–07 |volume= XXVIII |edition= 3 |year= 2005}}</ref> The [[Association of American Universities]] invited Northwestern to become a member in 1917. [[File:Deering front.jpg|thumb|left|Deering Library (1933)]]
Under [[Walter Dill Scott]]'s presidency from 1920 to 1939, Northwestern began construction of an integrated campus in Chicago designed by [[James Gamble Rogers]] to house the professional schools; established the [[Kellogg School of Management]]; and built several prominent buildings on the Evanston campus, [[Dyche Stadium]] (now named Ryan Field) and [[Deering Library]] among others. In 1933 a proposal to merge Northwestern with the [[University of Chicago]] was considered but rejected.<ref name="Barnes">{{cite journal|last= Barnes |first= Sarah |title= A Lost Opportunity in American Education?

Northwestern played host to the first-ever [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] game in 1939 in the original [[Patten Gymnasium]], which was later demolished and relocated farther north along with the [[Dearborn Observatory]] to make room for the [[Northwestern Technological Institute|Technological Institute]].
[[File:TechInstitute-PreLakefill.jpg|thumb|Technological Institute in 1942, after the relocation of Patten Gymnasium but before the construction of the [[Northwestern University Lakefill|Lakefill]] ]]

After the golden years of the 1920s, the [[Great Depression in the United States]] (1929–1941) hit Northwestern hard. Its annual income dropped 25 percent from $4.8 million in 1930-31 to $3.6 million in 1933-34. Investment income shrank, fewer people could pay full tuition, and annual giving from  alumni and philanthropy fell from $870,000 in 1932 to a low of  $331,000 in 1935. The university responded with two salary cuts of 10 percent each for all employees. It imposed a hiring freeze, a building freeze, and slashed appropriations for maintenance, books, and research. Having had a balanced budget in 1930-31, the university now faced deficits of roughly $100,000 for the next four years, which was made up by using the endowment. Enrollments fell in most schools, with law and music suffering the biggest declines. But the movement toward state certification of school teachers prompted Northwestern to start a new graduate program in education, thereby bringing in new students and much needed income. In June 1933, [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]], president of the University of Chicago, proposed a merger of the two universities, estimating annual savings of $1.7 million. The two presidents were enthusiastic, and the faculty liked the idea; the Northwestern alumni, however, opposed it, fearing the loss of their Alma Mater and its many traditions that distinguished Northwestern from Chicago. The medical school, for example, was oriented toward training practitioners, and feared it would lose its mission if it were merged into the larger, more research-oriented [[University of Chicago Medical School]].  The merger plan was dropped.  The [[Charles Deering|Deering]] family gave an unrestricted gift of $6 million in 1935 that rescued the budget, bringing it up to $5.4 million in 1938-39. That allowed many of the spending cuts to be restored, including  half the salary reductions.<ref>Harold F. Williamson and Payson S. Wild, ''Northwestern University: A History, 1850-1975'' (1976) pp  180-95.</ref>

Like other American research universities, Northwestern was transformed by [[World War II]] (1939–1945). The regular enrollment fell dramatically, but the school opened high-intensity, short-term courses that trained over 50,000 military personnel.  [[Franklyn B. Snyder]] led the university from 1939 to 1949, and after the war, surging enrollments under the [[G.I. Bill]] drove dramatic expansion of both campuses. In 1948 prominent anthropologist [[Melville J. Herskovits]] founded the Program of [[African studies|African Studies]] at Northwestern, the first center of its kind at an American academic institution.<ref>{{cite news |title= Pioneering Scholar in African Studies Finally Gets His Due |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-10-28/news/9510280065_1_african-cultural-heritage-black-experience-black-scholars |newspaper= Chicago Tribune  |date= October 28, 1995 |last= Secter |first= Bob}}</ref> [[J.

Though government support for universities declined in the 1970s and 1980s, President [[Arnold R. Weber]] was able to stabilize university finances, leading to a revitalization of the campuses. As admissions to colleges and universities grew increasingly competitive in the 1990s and 2000s, President [[Henry S. Bienen]]'s tenure saw a notable increase in the number and quality of undergraduate applicants, continued expansion of the facilities and faculty, and renewed athletic competitiveness. In 1999, Northwestern student journalists uncovered information exonerating Illinois [[death-row]] inmate [[Anthony Porter]] two days before his scheduled execution, and the Innocence Project has since exonerated 10 more men.<ref>{{cite news |title=A New Ending To an Old Story; Journalism Students Rewrite the Case Of an Innocent Man Set to Die |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=February 17, 1999 |first=Jon |last=Jeter}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/journalism/undergrad/page.aspx?id=59507 |title=Medill Innocence Project |access-date=August 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514052350/http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/journalism/undergrad/page.aspx?id=59507 |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On January 11, 2003, in a speech at Northwestern School of Law's Lincoln Hall, then [[Governor of Illinois]] [[George Ryan]] announced that he would [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] the sentences of more than 150 death-row inmates.<ref>{{cite news |title=Decision day for 156 inmates; Ryan poised to make history after 3 years of debate on death penalty |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-01-12/news/0301120040_1_madison-hobley-blanket-commutation-death-penalty |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |first1=Steve |last1=Mills |first2=Maurice |last2=Possley |date=January 12, 2003}}</ref>

Northwestern's Evanston campus, where the undergraduate schools, the Graduate School, and the Kellogg School of Management are located, runs north-south from Lincoln Avenue to Clark Street west of Lake Michigan along  [[Sheridan Road]]. North and South Campuses have noticeably different atmospheres, owing to the predominance of Science and Athletics in the one and Humanities and Arts in the other. North Campus is home to the [[Fraternity and sorority houses|fraternity]] [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quads]], the Henry Crown Sports Pavilion and Norris Aquatics Center and other athletic facilities, the [[Northwestern Technological Institute|Technological Institute]], [[Dearborn Observatory]], and other science-related buildings including Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Hall for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center. South Campus is home to the university's humanities buildings, [[Pick-Staiger Concert Hall]] and other music buildings, the [[Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art]], and the [[Fraternity and sorority houses|sorority]] quads.  In the 1960s, the university created an additional {{convert|84|acre|ha|1}} by means of a lakefill in Lake Michigan. Among some of the buildings located on these broad new acres are University Library, [[Norris University Center]] (the student union), and [[Pick-Staiger Concert Hall]].

The [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Chicago 'L'|elevated train]] running through Evanston is called the [[Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Purple Line]], taking its name from Northwestern's school color. The [[Foster (CTA)|Foster]] and [[Davis (CTA)|Davis]] stations are within walking distance of the southern end of the campus, while the [[Noyes (CTA)|Noyes]] station is close to the northern end of the campus. The [[Central (CTA Purple Line)|Central]] station is close to [[Ryan Field (stadium)|Ryan Field]], Northwestern's football stadium.  The [[Evanston Davis Street (Metra)|Evanston Davis Street]] [[Metra]] station serves the Northwestern campus in downtown Evanston and the [[Evanston Central Street (Metra)|Evanston Central Street]] Metra station is near Ryan Field. Pace Suburban Bus Service and the CTA have several bus routes that run through or near the Evanston campus.

Northwestern's Chicago campus is located in the city's [[Streeterville]] neighborhood. The Chicago campus is home to the nationally ranked and affiliated [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]], the [[Feinberg School of Medicine|medical school]], the [[Northwestern University School of Law|law school]], the part-time [[MBA]] program, and the [[Northwestern University School of Professional Studies|School of Professional Studies]]. Northwestern's professional schools and affiliated hospitals are about four blocks east of the [[Chicago (CTA Red Line)|Chicago]] station on the CTA [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red Line]]. The Chicago campus is also served by CTA bus routes.

Founded at various times in the university's history, the professional schools originally were scattered throughout Chicago.<ref name="Chicago Campus">{{cite web|url=http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/exhibits/architecture/building.php?bid=7 |title=Northwestern Architecture, Chicago Campus |publisher=Northwestern University Archives |access-date=July 11, 2008}}</ref> In connection with a 1917 master plan for a central Chicago campus and President [[Walter Dill Scott]]'s capital campaign, {{convert|8.5|acre|ha|2}} of land were purchased at the corner of [[Chicago Avenue]] and [[Lake Shore Drive]] for $1.5 million in 1920.<ref name="Chicago Campus"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758505,00.html |title=Refund |access-date=July 11, 2008 |date=November 29, 1937 |work=Time | location = New York }}</ref> The architect [[James Gamble Rogers]] was commissioned to create a master plan for the principal buildings on the new campus which he designed in  [[collegiate gothic]] style.

In Fall 2008, Northwestern opened a campus in [[Education City]], [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], joining five other American universities: [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Cornell University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Texas A&M University]], and [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].<ref name="meivy">{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/bin/printfriendly.php?id=9921842 |title=Oil money cultivates a Mideast Ivy League |last=Lewin |first=Tamar |newspaper=International Herald Tribune | location = Paris |date=February 11, 2008 |access-date=January 6, 2009}}</ref> Through the [[Medill School of Journalism]] and [[Northwestern University School of Communication|School of Communication]], NU-Q offers [[bachelor's degree]]s in journalism and communication respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qatar.northwestern.edu/ |title=Northwestern University in Qatar |publisher=Northwestern University |access-date=January 6, 2009}}</ref> However, some have questioned whether NU-Q can truly offer a comparable journalism program to that of its U.S. campus given Qatar's strict limits on journalistic and academic freedoms and instances of [[censorship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/12/17/northwestern-professor-raises-questions-about-its-branch-in-qatar/|title=Northwestern professor raises questions about its branch in Qatar|access-date=October 2, 2016}}</ref><ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/in-qatars-education-city-us-colleges-are-building-an-academic-oasis/2015/12/06/6b538702-8e01-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html|title=In Qatar's Education City, U.S. colleges are building an academic oasis|access-date=October 2, 2016}}</ref> The [[Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development]], a private charitable institution started by former emir [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani|Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]] and his wife and mother of the current emir [[Moza bint Nasser|Sheikha Moza bint Nasser]], provided funding for construction and administrative costs as well as support to hire 50 to 60 faculty and staff, some of whom rotate between the Evanston and Qatar campuses.<ref>{{cite news |title=Qatar entices NU to expand east: School near deal to open a campus |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-04-06/news/0704050721_1_foreign-students-qatar-foundation-study-abroad |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=April 6, 2007 |last=Choen |first=Jodi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/06/america/NA-GEN-US-Qatar-Journalism-School.php |title=Northwestern University expected to open journalism school in Qatar |agency=The Associated Press | newspaper = International Herald Tribune | location = Paris |date=April 6, 2007 |access-date=January 6, 2009}}</ref> Northwestern receives about $45 million per year to operate the campus.<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/> In February 2016, Northwestern reached an agreement with the Qatar Foundation to extend the operations of the NU-Q branch for an additional decade, through the 2027–2028 academic year.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Northwestern University will stay a decade longer in Qatar|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/02/23/northwestern-university-will-stay-another-decade-in-qatar/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = February 23, 2016|access-date = February 23, 2016|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Nick|last = Anderson}}</ref> As with other universities with campuses in Doha, Northwestern has received criticism for accepting money from a country with poor human rights record.<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnewsjournal.com/stories/510712102-advocate-questions-motive-behind-qatar-s-financial-ties-to-u-s-colleges|title=Advocate questions motive behind Qatar's financial ties to U.S. colleges|first=Justin|last=Stoltzfus|access-date=October 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnewsjournal.com/stories/510639673-while-u-s-universities-see-dollar-signs-in-qatari-partnerships-some-cry-foul|title=While U.S. universities see dollar signs in Qatari partnerships, some cry foul|first=Gulf News Journal|last=Reports|access-date=October 2, 2016}}</ref>

===Sustainability===
In January 2009, the [[Green Power Partnership]] (sponsored by the [[EPA]]) listed Northwestern as one of the top 10 universities in the country in purchasing energy from renewable sources. The university matches 74 million [[kilowatt hour]]s (kWh) of its annual energy use with Green-e Certified [[Renewable Energy Certificate]]s (RECs). This green power commitment represents 30 percent of the university's total annual electricity use and places Northwestern in the EPA's Green Power Leadership Club. The 2010 Report by The Sustainable Endowments Institute awarded Northwestern a "B-" on its College Sustainability Report Card.<ref>{{cite web|title =The College Sustainability Report Card 2009|publisher =Sustainable Endowments Institute|url =http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/northwestern-university/|access-date = June 1, 2009 }}</ref> The Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern (ISEN), supporting research, teaching and outreach in these themes, was launched in 2008.<ref name="ISEN">{{cite web |url=http://www.isen.northwestern.edu/ |title=Institute for Sustainable Energy at Northwestern |publisher=Northwestern University |access-date=May 22, 2015}}</ref>

Northwestern requires that all new buildings be [[LEED-certified]]. Silverman Hall on the Evanston campus was awarded Gold LEED Certification in 2010; Wieboldt Hall on the Chicago campus was awarded Gold LEED Certification in 2007, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center on the Evanston campus was awarded Silver LEED Certification in 2006. New construction and renovation projects will be designed to provide at least a 20% improvement over energy code requirements where technically feasible.<ref>{{cite web|title =Northwestern University Facilities Management: Environmental Sustainability|publisher =Northwestern University|url =http://www.northwestern.edu/sustainability/strategic-initiatives/energy/index.html|access-date =August 15, 2013|url-status =dead|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130802210947/http://www.northwestern.edu/sustainability/strategic-initiatives/energy/index.html|archive-date =August 2, 2013|df =mdy-all}}</ref> The university also released at the beginning of the 2008–09 academic year the Evanston Campus Framework Plan, which outlines plans for future development of the Evanston Campus. The plan not only emphasizes the sustainable construction of buildings, but also discusses improving transportation by optimizing pedestrian and bicycle access.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/fm/campus/docs/CampusFrameworkPlanJuly2009.pdf |title=Northwestern University Evanston Campus Framework Plan |publisher=Northwestern University |access-date=June 1, 2009 }}</ref> Northwestern has had a comprehensive [[recycling]] program in place since 1990. More than 1,500 tons are recycled annually at Northwestern, which represents 30% of the waste produced on campus. All landscape waste at the university is composted.<ref name="ISEN" />

==Organization and administration==

Northwestern University is composed of 12 schools and colleges. The faculty for each school consists of the dean of the school and the instructional faculty. Faculty are responsible for teaching, research, advising students, and serving on committees. Each school's admission requirements, degree requirements, courses of study, and disciplinary and degree recommendations are determined by the voting members of that school's faculty (assistant professor and above).<ref name="Faculty handbook">{{cite web |url=http://www.northwestern.edu/provost/faculty/handbook.pdf |title=Faculty Handbook |publisher=Northwestern University |access-date=September 19, 2008 |archive-date=May 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514152234/http://www.northwestern.edu/provost/faculty/handbook.pdf |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2003, Northwestern finished a five-year capital campaign that raised $1.55 billion, $550 million more than its goal. In 2007, the university sold its royalty interest in the pain relief drug [[Lyrica]] for $700 million, a drug developed at Northwestern by [[Richard Bruce Silverman]] (for whom Silverman Hall was named), who is the John Evans Professor of Chemistry. This was the largest such sale in history,<ref name="Lyrica">{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/DiabetesResource/story?id=4025983&page=1 |title=College Cashes In on Diabetes Pain Drug | work =ABC News |access-date=January 4, 2009 |date=December 19, 2007}}</ref> the proceeds of which were added to the endowment.<ref name="Financial Report">{{cite web |url=http://www.northwestern.edu/accounting-services/2007%20Financial%20Report.pdf |title=2007 Financial Report |publisher=Northwestern University |access-date=January 3, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205103339/http://www.northwestern.edu/accounting-services/2007%20Financial%20Report.pdf |archive-date=February 5, 2009 }}</ref>

In 2014, Northwestern announced the "We Will Campaign" with a fundraising goal of $3.75 billion. As of February 28, 2017, the university has received $3.31 billion towards its goal.

In April 2016, Northwestern announced that it signed on to the Chicago Star Partnership, a City Colleges initiative. Through this partnership, Northwestern is one of 15 Illinois public and private universities that will "provide scholarships to students who graduate from Chicago Public Schools, get their associate degree from one of the city's community colleges, and then get admitted to a bachelor's degree program." The partnership was influenced by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who encouraged local universities to increase opportunities for students in the public school district. The [[University of Chicago]], [[Northeastern Illinois University]], the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|School of the Art Institute]], [[DePaul University]] and [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] are also part of the Star Scholars partnership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-northwestern-star-scholarships-20160413-story.html|title=Northwestern University opening more doors to community college students|last=Tribune|first=Chicago|website=chicagotribune.com|access-date=April 20, 2016}}</ref>

There are traditions long associated with [[Northwestern Wildcats football|football]] games. Students growl like wildcats when the opposing team controls the ball, while simulating a paw with their hands. They will also jingle keys at the beginning of each kickoff. In the past, before the tradition was discontinued, students would throw marshmallows during games.<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Lanning |url=http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2007/09/4005/nufootball/ |title=Keys, claws and nachos for breakfast: A beginners' guide to NU football games |date=September 27, 2007 |access-date=August 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920024508/http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2007/09/4005/nufootball/ |archive-date=September 20, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Clock Tower at the Rebecca Crown Center glows purple, instead of its usual white, after a winning game, thereby proclaiming the happy news.

Whereas formerly the Clock Tower was lighted only for football victories, wins for [[Northwestern Wildcats men's basketball|men's basketball]] and [[Northwestern Wildcats women's lacrosse|women's lacrosse]] now merit commemoration as well; important victories in other sports may also prompt an empurpling.

===Performing arts===
Two annual productions are especially notable: [[The Waa-Mu Show]], and the [[Dolphin show]]. Waa-Mu is an original musical, written and produced almost entirely by students.<ref>{{cite web|title=Waa-Mu Shares Tips for Writing Musicals|publisher=Northwestern University| url=http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2013/03/waa-mu-students-share-tips-for-writing-musicals.html}}</ref> Children's theater is represented on campus by Griffin's Tale and Purple Crayon Players.<ref>{{cite web |title=Purple Crayon Players History |publisher=Northwestern University |url=http://groups.northwestern.edu/purplecrayonplayers/history.html |access-date=August 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102003536/http://groups.northwestern.edu/purplecrayonplayers/history.html |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Its umbrella organization — the Student Theatre Coalition, or StuCo — organizes nine student theater companies, multiple performance groups and more than sixty independent productions each year.<ref>{{cite web|title= What is StuCo?|publisher= Northwestern University's Student Theatre Coalition|url= http://nustudenttheatre.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page|access-date= August 15, 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130812064725/http://nustudenttheatre.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page|archive-date= August 12, 2013|url-status= dead|df= mdy-all}}</ref> Many Northwestern alumni have used these productions as stepping stones to successful television and film careers. Chicago's [[Lookingglass Theatre Company]], for example, which began life in the Great Room in [[Jones Residential College]], was founded in 1988 by several alumni, including [[David Schwimmer]]; in 2011, it won the Regional Tony Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lookingglass Theatre wins regional Tony Award |date= May 3, 2011 |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20110503/NEWS07/110509969/lookingglass-theatre-wins-regional-tony-award |work=Crain's Chicago Business |agency=Associate Press |access-date=August 15, 2013}}</ref>

Nickname:
Before 1924, they were known as "The Purple" and unofficially as "The Fighting Methodists." The name Wildcats was bestowed upon the university in 1924 by Wallace Abbey, a writer for the [[Chicago Daily Tribune]] who wrote that even in a loss to the [[University of Chicago]], "Football players had not come down from Evanston; wildcats would be a name better suited to [Coach Glenn] [[Glenn Thistlethwaite|Thistletwaite's]] boys."<ref>{{cite news |last=Abbey |first=Wallace |title=Maroons beat Purple by a Dropkick |pages=A1 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune  |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1924/11/16/page/25/article/maroons-beat-purple-by-dropkick |date=November 16, 1924}}</ref> The name was so popular that university board members made "wildcats" the official nickname just months later. In 1972, the student body voted to change the official nickname from "Wildcats" to "Purple Haze" but the new name never stuck.<ref>{{cite news|title=Purple Haze Won't Go Away At N.U. |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=April 18, 1972 |last=Damer |first=Roy}}</ref>

The mascot of Northwestern Athletics is [[Northwestern's Willie the Wildcat|Willie the Wildcat]]. The first mascot, however, was a live, caged bear cub from the [[Lincoln Park Zoo]] named Furpaw who was brought to the playing field on the day of a game to greet the fans. But after a losing season, the team, deciding that Furpaw was to blame for its misfortune, banished him from campus forever. Willie the Wildcat made his debut in 1933 first as a logo, and then in three dimensions in 1947, when members of the Alpha Delta fraternity dressed as wildcats during a Homecoming Parade. The [[Northwestern University Wildcat Marching Band|Northwestern University Marching Band (NUMB)]] performs at all home football games and leads cheers in the student section and performs the [[Alma Mater]] at the end of the game.
