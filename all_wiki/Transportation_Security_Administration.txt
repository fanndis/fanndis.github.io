The '''Transportation Security Administration''' ('''TSA''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] that has authority over the security of the traveling public in the United States. It was created as a response to the [[September 11 attacks]].

Chiefly concerned with [[air travel]], the TSA employs screening officers in airports, armed [[Federal Air Marshal Service|Federal Air Marshals]] on planes, mobile teams of dog handlers and explosives specialists.

==History and mission==
[[File:US-TransportationSecurityAdmin-DOTSeal.svg|thumb|180px|TSA's seal when the agency was part of the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation.]]]]
[[File:ITSA insignia pin ntegrity.jpg|180px|thumb|Historical TSA design used on TSO uniform patch, coin, and Year of Service pins.]]
<!-- linked from redirect [[John Tyner]] -->
The TSA was created largely in response to the terrorist attacks of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], which revealed weaknesses in existing airport security procedures.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016|title=Front Matter|journal=Criticism|volume=58 |issue=3|doi=10.13110/criticism.58.3.fm|issn=0011-1589}}</ref> At the time, a myriad of [[private security companies]] managed air travel security under contract to individual airlines or groups of airlines that used a given airport or terminal facility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/airports-before-911_n_57c85e17e4b078581f11a133|title=This Is What It Was Like To Go To The Airport Before 9/11|first=Lydia|last=O'Connor|date=September 11, 2016|website=HuffPost}}</ref> Proponents of placing the government in charge of airport security, including Transportation Secretary [[Norman Mineta]], argued that only a single federal agency could best protect passenger aviation.

Congress agreed, and authorized the creation of the TSA in the [[Aviation and Transportation Security Act]], which was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on November 19, 2001. Bush nominated [[John Magaw]] on December 10, and he was confirmed by the Senate the following January. The agency was initially placed under the [[United States Department of Transportation]], but was moved to the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] when that department was formed on March 9, 2003.

The new agency's effort to hire screeners to begin operating security checkpoints at airports represents a case of a large-scale staffing project completed over a short period. The only effort in U.S. history that came close to it was the testing of recruits for the armed forces in World War II. During the period from February to December 2002, 1.7 million applicants were assessed for 55,000 screening jobs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Work in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Industrial and Organizational Psychology|last=Landy |first=Frank J.|last2=Conte|first2=Jeffery M.|date=December 26, 2012|publisher=Wiley; 4 edition|isbn=9781118291207|pages=263}}</ref>

The TSA develops broad policies to protect the U.S. transportation system, including highways, railroads, buses, mass transit systems, ports, and pipelines. It fulfills this mission in conjunction with other federal agencies and [[U.S. state|state]] partners. However, the TSA's primary focus is on [[airport security]] and the prevention of [[aircraft hijacking]]. It is responsible for screening passengers and baggage at more than 450 U.S. airports.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://hraccess.tsa.dhs.gov/hraccess/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807083858/https://tsajobs.tsa.dhs.gov/tsajobs/|url-status=dead|title=TSAJobs Home|archivedate=August 7, 2015|website=hraccess.tsa.dhs.gov}}</ref>

==Administration and organization==
[[File:Office buildings in Pentagon City.JPG|thumb|TSA headquarters located in [[Pentagon City|Pentagon City, Arlington County, Virginia]]]]

=== Leadership ===
When TSA was part of the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], the head of the agency was referred to as the '''Under Secretary of Transportation for Security'''. Following the move to the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] in March 2003, the position was reclassified as the '''Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration'''.

There have been seven administrators and six acting administrators in the TSA's 18-year history.

Following the passage of the [[FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018]] which included a provision known as the TSA Modernization Act, the Administrator's term was set as a five-year term retroactive to the start of current Administrator David Pekoske's term. It also made the Deputy Administrator a [[Political appointments in the United States|politically appointed]] position.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atwonline.com/security/us-transportation-security-administration-reauthorized-through-2021 |title=US Transportation Security Administration reauthorized through 2021 |last=Goldstein |first=Ben |date=October 4, 2018 |website=ATWonline.com |publisher= [[Aviation Week]]|access-date=October 23, 2018 |quote=The bill modifies the agency’s leadership structure by setting a five-year term for the administrator of TSA and makes the deputy administrator a position appointed by the president}}</ref>

===Organizational structure===
All offices are headed by an Assistant Administrator, except for the offices of Enterprise Support, Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Service, Operations Support and Security Operations, which are headed by an Executive Assistant Administrator; the office of Chief Counsel, uses the title of Chief Counsel. The Compliance and Professional Responsibility offices and Strategy, Policy Coordination and Innovation office are referred to as a Director for the former two and Executive Director for the latter. The Executive Assistant Administrator for Law Enforcement is also the Director of the [[Federal Air Marshal Service]].<ref name="TSALeaders">{{cite web |url=https://www.tsa.gov/about/tsa-leadership |title=Leadership and Organization |website=TSA.gov |publisher=Transportation Security Administration |access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref><ref name="TSAOrgChart">{{cite web |url=https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/tsa_org_chart_matrix.pdf |title=TSA Organizational Chart |date=April 1, 2020 |website=TSA.gov |publisher=Transportation Security Administration |access-date=April 26, 2020}}</ref>

===New headquarters===
In August 2017, the [[General Services Administration]] announced a new headquarters for the TSA would be built in [[Springfield, Virginia]]. The new, 625,000-square-foot headquarters will be a short distance from the [[Franconia-Springfield Station|Franconia-Springfield Metro station]] and is projected to cost $316 million for a 15-year lease. The facility is expected to open in mid-2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/08/24/gsa-picks-a-new-headquarters-site-for-the-tsa.html|title=At long last, GSA picks a new headquarters site for the TSA|last=Sernovitz|first=Daniel J.|date=August 24, 2017|work=[[Washington Business Journal]]|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>

=== Insignia ===
On September 11, 2018, TSA adopted a new flag representing its core values and founding principles.  The design features a white, graphically-stylized American eagle sitting centrally located inside rings of red and white against a field of blue, with its dynamically-feathered wings outstretched in a pose signifying protection, vigilance, and commitment. The eagle’s wings, which break through the red and white containment rings, indicate freedom of movement. There are nine stars and 11 rays emanating out from the top of the eagle to reference September 11. There is also a representation of land (roads) and sea which is representative of the modes of transportation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pekoske |first1=David |title=Remarks at 2018 Sept. 11 Commemoration |url=https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/speech/2018/09/11/remarks-2018-sept-11-commemoration |website=TSA.gov |publisher=Transportation Security Administration |accessdate=28 May 2020}}</ref>

Part of the TSA budget comes from a $2.50 per-passenger tax. The Obama administration had proposed tripling this fee by 2019, with most of the increase going to reduce the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/US/tsa-fee-taxes-air/2013/12/10/id/540999|title=TSA Fee Would Double Under New Proposal|work=Newsmax}}</ref>

Additionally, a small portion of TSA's budget comes from the loose change and cash left behind by travelers at airport security checkpoints, which TSA has been allowed to retain since 2005. From FY 2008 through FY 2018, a total of $6,904,035.98 has been left behind, including a record $960,105.49 in FY 2018.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gayden |first=Greg |date=2017 |title=Commercial Aviation 101|url=http://www.dfwtower.com/101/CommercialAviation101.pdf |location=Dallas |publisher=443 Critical |page=43}}

=== Airport screening ===
Private screening did not disappear entirely under the TSA, which allows airports to opt out of federal screening and hire firms to do the job instead. Such firms must still get TSA approval under its [[Screening Partnership Program]] (SPP) and follow TSA procedures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1228247,00.html|title=An Airport Screener's Complaint|author=Greg fulton|date=August 17, 2006|accessdate=November 19, 2010|publisher=Time.com}}</ref> Among the U.S. airports with privately operated checkpoints are [[San Francisco International Airport]]; [[Kansas City International Airport]]; [[Greater Rochester International Airport]]; [[Tupelo Regional Airport]]; [[Key West International Airport]]; [[Charles M.

However, the bulk of airport screening in the U.S. is done by the TSA's 46,661 (as of FY 2018) Transportation Security Officers (TSOs), often referred to as screeners or agents.
<ref>{{cite book |last=Gayden |first=Greg |date=2017 |title=Commercial Aviation 101|url=http://www.dfwtower.com/101/CommercialAviation101.pdf |location=Dallas |publisher=443 Critical |page=16}}

Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) provide security and protection of air travelers, airports and aircraft. This includes:
* Operating various screening equipment and technology to identify dangerous objects in baggage, cargo, and on passengers, and preventing those objects from being transported onto aircraft.
* Performing searches and screening, which may include physical interaction with passengers (e.g., pat-downs, search of property, etc.), conducting bag searches and lifting/carrying bags, bins, and property weighing up to 70lbs.
* Controlling terminal entry and exit points.
* Interacting with the public, giving directions and responding to inquiries.
* Maintaining focus and awareness while working in a stressful environment which includes noise from alarms, machinery and people, crowd distractions, time pressure, and disruptive and angry passengers, in order to preserve the professional ability to identify and locate potentially life threatening or mass destruction devices, and to make effective decisions in both crisis and routine situations.
* Engaging in continuous development of critical thinking skills, necessary to mitigate actual and potential security threats, by identifying, evaluating, and applying appropriate situational options and approaches. This may include application of risk-based security screening protocols that vary based on program requirements.
* Retaining and implementing knowledge of all applicable Standard Operating Procedures, demonstrating responsible and dependable behavior, and is open to change and adapts to new information or unexpected obstacles.<ref name="usajobs.gov">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/454238900/|title=Transportation Security Officer (TSO)|website=USAJOBS|access-date=November 15, 2016}}</ref>

| Behavior Detection Officers: In 2003, the TSA implemented the [[Screening of Passengers by Observation Technique]] (SPOT), which expanded across the United States in 2007. In this program, Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs), who are TSOs, observe passengers as they go through [[security checkpoint]]s, looking for behaviors that might indicate a higher risk.

| [[Federal Flight Deck Officer]] (FFDOs) are the airline pilots working for the U.S. airlines, who are sworn and deputized as federal [[law enforcement officers]] (FLEOs) to carry out the law enforcement duties within their specific jurisdictions (flight deck) and only from the time their aircraft doors are closed and until they are opened. FFDOs do not have arrest powers, but are authorized to carry a federally issued firearm and use force (including deadly force). While the program is voluntary, only active part 121 airline pilots are eligible for the FFDO program. FFDO's are trained by the [[Federal Air Marshal Service]] and deputized by the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. Their primary goal is to work with (or without) the FAM team to defend the flight deck from [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]], criminal violence, or any other terrorist threats to their aircraft.

===Uniforms===
In 2008, TSA officers began wearing new uniforms that have a blue-gray 65/35 polyester/cotton blend duty shirt, black pants, a wider black belt, and optional short-sleeved shirts and black vests (for seasonal reasons).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120322224740/http://www.tsa.gov/assets/pdf/foia/TSA_MD_1100_73_2_FINAL_070621.pdf TSA Management Directive No. 1100.73-2 – TSO Dress and Appearance Responsibilities] Retrieved May 26, 2010.</ref> The first airport to introduce the new uniforms was [[Baltimore-Washington International Airport]]. Starting on September 11, 2008, all TSOs began wearing the new uniform. One stripe on each [[shoulder board]] denotes a TSO, two stripes a Lead TSO, and three a Supervisory TSO.

Officers are issued badges and shoulder boards after completing a 2-week mandatory training at their academy at the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]] (FLETC) in [[Glynco, Georgia]].

===Passenger and carry-on screening===

====Identification requirements====
{{See also|No Fly List}}

The TSA requires that passengers show a valid ID at the security checkpoint before boarding their flight.  Valid forms of identification include [[passport]]s from the U.S. or a foreign government, state-issued photo identification, or military ID. Passengers that do not have ID may still be allowed to fly if their identity can be verified through an alternate way.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids | title=Acceptable IDs | publisher=Transportation Security Administration | work=tsa.gov | date=August 26, 2013 | accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref>

===== REAL ID requirements =====
Passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 2005, the REAL ID Act established minimum security standards for state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards and prohibits federal agencies, like TSA, from accepting licenses and identification cards for official purposes from states that do not meet these standards.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/resources/realid_factsheet_071516-508.pdf|title=TSA Real ID and Air Travel|website=www.tsa.gov/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115140432/https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/resources/realid_factsheet_071516-508.pdf|archivedate=November 15, 2016|url-status=dead|access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref>

====== Enforcement dates ======
Beginning January 22, 2018, driver's licenses or state IDs issued by states that are not in compliance with the REAL ID Act and have not been granted an extension by DHS may not be used to fly within the U.S.

Beginning October 1, 2021, every traveler will need a REAL ID-compliant license or state ID or another acceptable form of identification to fly within the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsa.gov/real-id|title=REAL ID &#124; Transportation Security Administration|website=www.tsa.gov|accessdate=August 23, 2020}}</ref>

Neffenger told a Senate committee that small airports had the option to use "reverse screening" – a system where passengers are not screened before boarding the aircraft at departure, but instead are screened upon arrival at the destination. The procedure is intended to save costs at airports with a limited number of flights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816064154/http://700wlw.iheart.com/onair/aviation-blog-jay-ratliff-43304/tsas-moneysaving-plan-screen-after-the-14643459/|title=TSA's Money-Saving Plan: Screen after the flight?? &#124; Aviation Blog - Jay Ratliff &#124; 700WLW|date=August 16, 2016|website=web.archive.org|accessdate=August 23, 2020}}</ref>

After the November 2010 initiation of enhanced screening procedures of all airline passengers and flight crews, the [[US Airline Pilots Association]] issued a press release stating that pilots should not submit to full body scanners because of unknown radiation risks and calling for strict guidelines for pat-downs of pilots, including evaluation of their fitness for duty after the pat-down, given the stressful nature of pat-downs.<ref name="Sharkey">Joe Sharkey, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/business/16road.html?_r=1&ref=joe_sharkey Screening Protests Grow as Holiday Crunch Looms] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221235651/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/business/16road.html?_r=1&ref=joe_sharkey |date=February 21, 2015 }}, ''[[New York Times]]'', November 15, 2010.</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722040738/http://usairlinepilots.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7709several President’s Message], [[US Airline Pilots Association]] press release, November 8, 2010.</ref> Two airline pilots filed suit against the procedures.<ref>Steve Everly and Randy Heaster, [http://www.kansascity.com/2010/11/19/2454162/airline-security-gets-private.htm Airline security gets private]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}, [[The Kansas City Star]], November 19, 2010.</ref>

On July 2, 2010, the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC) filed a lawsuit in federal court asking to halt the use of full body scanners by the TSA on [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth amendment]] grounds, and arguing that the TSA had failed to allow a public notice and rule making period.  In July 2011, the D.C. Circuit court of appeals ruled that the TSA did violate the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] by failing to allowing a public notice and comment rule making period. The Court ordered the agency to "promptly" undertake a public notice and comment rule making. In July 2012, EPIC returned to court and asked the court to force enforcement; in August, the court granted the request to compel the TSA to explain its actions by the end of the month.<ref>[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/court-orders-tsa-to-justify-year-long-defiance-of-the-law/ ARS Technica] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420064638/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/court-orders-tsa-to-justify-year-long-defiance-of-the-law/ |date=April 20, 2016 }}- Posted August 2, 2012; Retrieved August 8, 2012</ref> The agency responded on August 30, saying that there was ""no basis whatsoever for (The DC Circuit Court's) assertion that TSA has delayed implementing this court's mandate," and said it was awaiting approval from the Department of Homeland Security before the hearings take place.

====Unintended consequences of screening enhancements====
Two studies by a group of [[Cornell University]] researchers have found that strict airport security has the unintended consequence of increasing road fatalities, as would-be air travelers decide to drive and are exposed to the far greater risk of dying in a car accident.<ref name="cornell1" /><ref name="cornell2" /> In 2005, the researchers looked at the immediate aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and found that the change in passenger travel modes led to 242 added driving deaths per month.<ref name="cornell1">{{cite journal|last=Blalock|first=Garrick|author2=Vrinda Kadiyali |author3=Daniel H. Simon |date=February 10, 2005|title=The Impact of 9/11 on Road Fatalities: The Other Lives Lost to Terrorism|journal=SSRN Working Paper Series|issn=1556-5068|doi=10.2139/ssrn.677549|ssrn=677549}}</ref> In all, they estimated that about 1,200 driving deaths could be attributed to the short-term effects of the attacks. The study attributes the change in traveler behavior to two factors: fear of terrorist attacks and the wish to avoid the inconvenience of strict security measures; no attempt is made to estimate separately the influence of each of these two factors.

In 2007, the researchers studied the specific effects of a change to security practices instituted by the TSA in late 2002. They concluded that this change reduced the number of air travelers by 6%, and estimated that consequently, 129 more people died in car accidents in the fourth quarter of 2002.<ref name="cornell2">{{cite web|url=http://aem.cornell.edu/faculty_sites/gb78/wp/JLE_6301.pdf |title=AEM.cornell.edu |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}</ref> Extrapolating this rate of fatalities, ''New York Times'' contributor [[Nate Silver]] remarked that this is equivalent to "four fully loaded Boeing 737s crashing each year."<ref>{{cite news|last=Silver |first=Nate |url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/the-hidden-costs-of-extra-airport-security/?partner=rss&emc=rss |title=The Hidden Costs of Extra Security - NYTimes.com |publisher=Fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com |date= November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 19, 2010}}</ref> The 2007 study also noted that strict airport security hurts the airline industry; it was estimated that the 6% reduction in the number of passengers in the fourth quarter of 2002 cost the industry $1.1 billion in lost business.<ref name="Blalock2007">{{cite journal|last=Blalock|first=Garrick|author2=Vrinda Kadiyali |author3=Daniel H.

In 2008, an investigative report by [[WTAE-TV|WTAE]] in Pittsburgh discovered that despite over 400 reports of baggage theft, about half of which the TSA reimbursed passengers for, not a single arrest had been made.<ref name="wtae">{{cite news|url=http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/4530735/detail.html|title=Team 4: Airport Baggage Theft Claims|last=Parsons|first=Jim|date=May 25, 2005|accessdate=August 2, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616070943/http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/4530735/detail.html|archivedate=June 16, 2008|url-status=dead|publisher=[[WTAE-TV]]|location=Pittsburgh}}</ref> The TSA does not, as a matter of policy, share baggage theft reports with local police departments.<ref name=wtae/>

In September 2012, ABC News interviewed former TSA agent Pythias Brown, who has admitted to stealing more than $800,000 worth of items during his employment with the agency. Brown stated that it was "very convenient to steal" and poor morale within the agency is what causes agents to steal from passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/convicted-tsa-officer-reveals-secrets-thefts-airports/story?id=17339513&page=2#.UGZq3lHGjs0|title=Convicted TSA Officer Reveals Secrets of Thefts at Airports|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}</ref>

The TSA has also been criticized for not responding properly to theft and failing to reimburse passengers for stolen goods. For example, between 2011 and 2012, passengers at [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] reported $300,000 in property lost or damaged by the TSA. The agency only reimbursed $35,000 of those claims.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/hundreds-complaints-filed-tsa-over-lost-items-hart/nWHZ4/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208054723/http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/hundreds-complaints-filed-tsa-over-lost-items-hart/nWHZ4/|url-status=dead|title=Hundreds of complaints filed with TSA over lost items at Hartfield|archivedate=February 8, 2013}}</ref> Similar statistics were found at Jacksonville International Airport – passengers reported $22,000 worth of goods missing or damaged over the course of 15 months.

===Data security incidents===

====Employee records lost or stolen====
In 2007, an unencrypted computer [[hard drive]] containing [[Social Security Administration|Social Security]] numbers, bank data, and payroll information for about 100,000 employees was lost or stolen from TSA headquarters. Kip Hawley alerted TSA employees to the loss, and apologized for it. The agency asked the [[FBI]] to investigate. There were no reports that the data was later misused.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/18497134 |title=TSA Computer Hard Drive Missing |agency=Associated Press |author=Matt Apuzzo |date=May 4, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-16-tsa-missing-drive_N.htm|title=TSA: Missing hard drive left unprotected|date=July 16, 2007|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=April 7, 2013}}</ref>

====Unsecured website====

In 2007, [[Christopher Soghoian]], a blogger and security researcher, said that a TSA website was collecting private passenger information in an unsecured manner, exposing passengers to [[identity theft]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://paranoia.dubfire.net/2007/02/tsa-has-outsourced-tsa-traveler.html |title=TSA has outsourced the TSA Traveler Identity Verification Program? |accessdate=June 16, 2007 |last=Soghoian |first=Christopher |date=February 13, 2007 |work=Slight paranoia }}</ref> The website allowed passengers to dispute their inclusion on the [[No Fly List]].

In December 2009, someone within the TSA posted a sensitive manual titled "Screening Management [[Standard Operating Procedures|SOP]]" on secret airport screening guidelines to an obscure URL on the FedBizOpps website. The manual was taken down quickly, but the breach raised questions about whether security practices had been compromised.<ref>{{cite news

On December 3, 2013, the United States House of Representatives passed the [[Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act (H.R. 2719; 113th Congress)]] in response to criticism of the TSA's acquisition process as wasteful, costly, and ineffective.<ref name=techreform1>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House to push tech reform at TSA|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/technology/191721-house-to-push-tech-reform-at-tsa|accessdate=December 4, 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref><ref name="18 July 2013">{{cite web|title=Bipartisan Legislation Introduced to Reform TSA's Acquisition Process|url=http://homeland.house.gov/press-release/bipartisan-legislation-introduced-reform-tsa-s-acquisition-process|publisher=Committee on Homeland Security of the US House of Representatives|accessdate=December 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802085801/http://homeland.house.gov/press-release/bipartisan-legislation-introduced-reform-tsa-s-acquisition-process|archive-date=August 2, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> If the bill became law, it would require the TSA to develop a comprehensive technology acquisition plan and present regular reports to Congress about its successes and failures to adhere to this plan. An April 2013 report from the [[Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General]] indicated that the TSA had 17,000 items with an estimated cost of $185.7 million stored in its warehouses on May 31, 2012.<ref name=oigreportonwarehouse>{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Anne L.|title=Transportation Security Administration Logistics Center - Inventory Management|url=http://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2013/OIG_13-82_Apr13.pdf|publisher=Office of Inspector General - Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=December 4, 2013|date=April 26, 2013}}</ref> The auditors found that "TSA stored unusable or obsolete equipment, maintained inappropriate safety stock levels, and did not develop an inventory management process that systematically deploys equipment."<ref name="oigreportonwarehouse"/>

In January 2014, [[Jason Edward Harrington]], a former TSA screener at [[O'Hare International Airport]], said that fellow staff members assigned to review body scan images of airline passengers routinely joked about fliers' weight, attractiveness, and [[Human penis|penis]] and breast sizes. According to Harrington, screeners would alert each other to attractive female passengers with the code phrase "Hotel Papa" so that staff would have an opportunity to view the passengers' nude form in body scanner monitors and retaliated against rude flyers by delaying them at the checkpoint. TSA Administrator John Pistole responded by saying that all the scanners had been replaced and the screening rooms disabled. He did not deny that the behaviors described by Harrington took place.<ref>{{cite web|title='New TSA in town,' agency says in response to screener's charges|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/31/22527381-new-tsa-in-town-agency-says-in-response-to-screeners-charges?lite&lite=obinsite|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

In May 2016, actress [[Susan Sarandon]] claimed that during the entire time of the Bush administration she was "harassed everytime I came into the country". She said that she hired two lawyers to contact the TSA to determine why she had been targeted but that she assumed it was because she was critical of the Bush administration. She said the harassment stopped after her attorneys followed up a second time with the TSA.<ref>Interview on The Late, Late Show with James Corden. CBS Corporation. May 3, 2016.</ref>

In July 2018, a case heard in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit Appeals Court]] ruled that TSA agents are not "investigative or law enforcement officers" and thus are not liable under the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] (FTCA). The case extended from a woman who had been detained and arrested by TSA in 2006 but later the criminal charges were acquitted in court; she had sought damages under the FTCA for damages related to the false arrest and related matters.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tsa-lawsuit/tsa-screeners-win-immunity-from-abuse-claims-appeals-court-idUSKBN1K125W | title = TSA screeners win immunity from abuse claims: appeals court | first = Jonathan | last = Stempel | date = July 11, 2018 | accessdate = July 11, 2018 | work =[[Reuters]] }}</ref>

===Investigations of the TSA===
In 2013 The Office of Inspector General published a reported titled "TSA's Actions Insufficient to Address Inspector General Recommendations to Improve its Office of Inspection".  The report touched upon several topics of misconduct but the main focus of the report was of the TSA criminal investigators who received a premium on their pay despite not meeting the minimum qualification to be eligible for this pay.<ref>https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2013/OIG_13-123_Sep13.pdf</ref>

The TSA Office of Accountability Inspection Act of 2015 published by the Committee of Commerce, Science, and Transportation, was based on a report of an investigation which found issues with the TSA. The act also followed up the Office of Inspector General's 2013 report, mandating that the TSA should comply with Federal Regulation and correct the wage of the TSA's Criminal Investigators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-114srpt111/pdf/CRPT-114srpt111.pdf|title=TSA Office of Accountability Act|accessdate=August 23, 2020}}</ref> Had no action been taken this misuse of funds was estimated to cost taxpayers, in a span of five years, $17 million.<ref>https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-114publ53/pdf/PLAW-114publ53.pdf</ref>

In response the TSA contracted a consulting firm to assist the TSA with the Office of Inspector General recommendations. However Office of Inspector Generals has found the TSA's response lacking as they have yet to fix a majority of the issues brought up in the report.<ref>https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/pr/2015/oigpr_071315.pdf</ref>
