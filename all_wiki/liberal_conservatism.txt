'''Liberal conservatism''' is a [[political ideology]] combining [[Conservatism|conservative]] policies with [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances, especially on economic, social and ethical issues,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/content.html|date=2020|title=Content|website=Parties and Elections in Europe|first=Wolfram|last=Nordsieck}}</ref> representing a brand of political conservatism strongly influenced by liberalism.

Liberal conservatism incorporates the [[Classical liberalism|classical-liberal]] view of minimal government [[economic interventionism|intervention]] in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the [[Market (economics)|market]] and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, liberal conservatism also holds that individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} They also support [[civil liberties]], along with some [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] positions.

In Europe, liberal conservatism is the dominant form of contemporary conservatism and [[centre-right politics]].

== Overview, definitions and usage ==
Both ''conservatism'' and ''liberalism'' have had different meanings over time in different centuries. The term ''liberal conservatism'' has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] conservatism, which deems the principle of equality as something discordant with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the [[rule of law]], [[private property]], the [[market economy]] and [[constitution]]al [[Representative democracy|representative]] government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, the term ''liberal conservatism'' came to be understood simply as ''conservatism'' in popular culture,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=155}} prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly [[Classical liberalism|classical-liberal]] values to call themselves ''[[Libertarian conservatism|libertarians]]'' instead.<ref>Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011.</ref> However, there are differences between classical liberals and libertarians.{{sfn|van de Haar|2015|p=71}}

In the United States, conservatives often combine the economic [[individualism]] of classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government.<ref>Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.106-112</ref> From a different perspective, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] (a "hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism") has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality and patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, scepticism regarding progress and elitism.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDd5tKWT4D4C |title=The Right Nation: Why America is Different |first1=Adrian |last1=Wooldridge |first2=John |last2=Micklethwait |year=2011 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |via=Google Books |isbn=9780241958896}}</ref> Consequently, the term ''liberal conservatism'' is not used in the United States. [[Modern liberalism in the United States|Modern American liberalism]] happens to be quite different from [[Liberalism in Europe|European liberalism]] and occupies the [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] of the political spectrum, in contrast to many European countries where liberalism is often more associated with the [[Centrism|centre]] and [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] while [[social democracy]] makes up a substantial part of the centre-left. The opposite is true in [[Latin America]], where [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of [[neoliberalism]] both in popular culture and academic discourse.<ref>Bethell, Leslie: The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930. Cambridge University Press, 1991.</ref>

In their embracement of liberal and [[free market]] principles, European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those holding [[National conservatism|national-conservative]], fully [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] and/or outright [[Populism|populist]] views, let alone a [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] posture. Being liberal often involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]].{{cn|date=December 2019}} Compared to other centre-right political traditions such as [[Christian democracy]], liberal conservatives are less socially conservative and more economically liberal, favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Some regional varieties and peculiarities can be observed:
* In much of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Northwestern Europe]], especially in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] and traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries as well as the United Kingdom and Belgium, a divide persists between liberal conservatives (including [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]) and liberals (including [[Conservative liberalism|conservative liberals]] and [[Social liberalism|social liberals]]).
* In most [[Nordic countries]], liberal conservatives, Christian democrats and liberals form distinct political families and have each their own party. The largest liberal parties are the [[Nordic agrarian parties]], which are traditionally [[Agrarianism|agrarian]].
* In most countries where [[Romance languages]] are spoken and where [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] is or has been dominant as well as in Greece, liberal conservative movements, often encompassing Christian democrats and liberals,  have more recently gained traction and the terms ''conservative'' and ''liberal'' may be understood as synonymous.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

At the European level, Christian democrats and most liberal conservatives are affiliated to the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), while liberals (including conservative and social liberals) to the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]] (ALDE Party). In this context, some traditionally Christian-democratic parties (such as [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian-Democratic and Flemish]] in Belgium, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] in the Netherlands, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] in Germany and the [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] in Austria) have become almost undistinguishable from other liberal-conservative parties. On the other hand, newer liberal-conservative parties (such as [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] in Greece, the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] in Portugal, the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] in Spain, [[Forza Italia]]/[[The People of Freedom]]/[[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] in Italy, the [[Union for a Popular Movement]]/[[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] in France and most centre-right parties from countries once belonging to the [[Eastern Bloc]] and [[Yugoslavia]]) have not adopted traditional labels, but their ideologies are also a mixture of conservatism, Christian democracy and liberalism.

In the modern European discourse, ''liberal conservatism'' usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of [[social safety net]] and [[environmentalism]] (see also [[green conservatism]] and [[green liberalism]]). This variety of liberal conservatism has been espoused by Nordic conservatives (the [[Moderate Party]] in Sweden, the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] in Norway and the [[National Coalition Party]] in Finland) which have been fending off competition from right-wing populists to their right and do not include Christian democrats; and at times the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. In an interview shortly after taking office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2010, [[David Cameron]] introduced himself as a liberal conservative.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cameron |first=David |title=I am a Liberal Conservative |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685185.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=18 August 2012 |date=2010-05-16}}</ref> During his first speech to a party conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and [[human rights]], but being skeptical of "grand schemes to remake the world".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5407714.stm "Full text of David Cameron's speech to the Conservative Party conference"], BBC, October 2006</ref>

== Classical conservatism and economic liberalism ==
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|left|150px|upright|[[Edmund Burke]]]]
Historically, [[conservatism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries comprised a set of principles based on concern for established [[tradition]], respect for [[authority]] and [[religious values]]. This form of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of [[Joseph de Maistre]] in the post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] age. Contemporaneous [[liberalism]], now recalled as [[classical liberalism]], advocated both [[political freedom]] for individuals and a [[free market]] in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], who are respectively remembered as the fathers of [[liberalism]], including [[economic liberalism]], the [[separation of church and state]], [[social liberalism]] and [[utilitarianism]].

[[File:Alexis de tocqueville cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]]]
According to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is "economics is prior to politics".<ref>{{cite book |last=Vincent |first=Andrew |title=Modern Political Ideologies |url=https://archive.org/details/modernpoliticali00vinc |url-access=limited |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Chichester, U.K. Malden, MA |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4051-5495-6 |chapter=Conservatism |pages=[https://archive.org/details/modernpoliticali00vinc/page/n74 65]–66}}</ref> Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues by authors such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]<ref>Lakoff, Sandoff, "Tocqueville, Burke, and the Origins of Liberal Conservatism." ''The review of politics'' '''60'''(3), pp. 435–464, 1998. {{doi|10.1017/S003467050002742X}}</ref> as the basis of current liberal conservatism which can be seen both in the works of [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]]. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an economically liberal outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of [[meritocracy]], without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the [[Western world]] came to adopt free market economic ideas as the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed and the aristocracy lost its power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, the term ''liberal'' is used in most countries to describe those with free-market economic views. This is the case in [[continental Europe]],<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&q=EU+left-wing+liberal+parties |title=Europe, a Political Profile: An American Companion to European Politics - Hans Slomp - Google Books |pages=106–108 |isbn=9780313391828 |last1=Slomp |first1=Hans |date=2011-09-26}}</ref> Australia<ref>{{cite news |last1=Goldfarb |first1=Michael |title=Liberal?
