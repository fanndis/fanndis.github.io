"'''Ring the Alarm'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] for her second studio album, ''[[B'Day (Beyoncé album)|B'Day]]'' (2006). It was written by Knowles, [[Swizz Beatz|Kasseem "Swizz Beatz" Dean]] and [[Sean Garrett]]. [[Columbia Records]] released "Ring the Alarm" as the second single from ''B'Day'' in the United States on October 17, 2006, while "[[Irreplaceable]]" (2006) was serviced as the album's second international and third US single. The song's development was motivated by Knowles' role in the Broadway musical adaptation ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' (2006). The cover art of "Ring the Alarm" proved controversial because Knowles used [[alligator]]s during the photography session. [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] declared that Knowles' posing with a baby alligator was arguably abusive to an animal.

"Ring the Alarm" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song. Its introduction features a blaring [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]], which sets an aggressive tone. The song's lyrics involve a woman who feels threatened, and is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from the protagonist's efforts to improve her lover's life. The lyrics were rumored to be about [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] recording artist [[Rihanna]]'s relationship with [[Jay-Z]]; Knowles refuted the allegation in an interview with ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine. The song was received with mixed reception for contemporary music critics, who noted that it was different from Knowles' previous work. While some commended her willingness to take risks, others were polarized about her aggressive vocals. "Ring the Alarm" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]] at the [[49th Grammy Awards]].

The single debuted at number 12 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming Knowles' highest US debut at the time. It reached number 11 on the chart, becoming her first solo single to peak below the top 10. Its accompanying [[music video]] was inspired by the 1992 film ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' and was directed by [[Sophie Muller]]. It was filmed inside a cavernous hangar on the [[Brooklyn]] waterfront in New York City. The video garnered generally mixed reviews critics, who universally thought that it was eccentric. Knowles promoted "Ring the Alarm" through various live performances on televised shows and awards ceremonies, including the [[2006 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The song was included on her [[set list]] on [[The Beyoncé Experience]] (2007) in Los Angeles, her world tour [[I Am... Tour]]. (2009–10), her [[On the Run Tour (Beyoncé and Jay-Z)|On the Run Tour]] (2014) with Jay-Z, [[The Formation World Tour]] (2016), and her [[OTR II]] (2018) with [[Jay-Z]] again.

It is apparent that there is a consistent plan by some to create chaos around Beyoncé's ''B'Day'' album release on September 4 in the US. First, it was a petition against the single, '[[Déjà Vu (Beyoncé song)|Déjà Vu]]', then a rumor regarding conflict between Beyoncé and Rihanna, seizures caused by the 'Ring the Alarm' video, putting out a single to compete with [[LeToya Luckett|LeToya]]'s [[LeToya (album)|album]] and now to add to all the ridiculous rumors, is my plan to postpone the release of her 'B'Day' album.

The [[cover art]] of "Ring the Alarm", caused controversy because alligators were used during the photography session. Knowles affirmed that using the animal, and taping their mouths shut, was her idea. [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), which had previously confronted her after she used furs for her fashion line's clothing design, contacted a biologist who wrote a letter to Knowles, "As a specialist in reptile biology and welfare, I'm concerned about your posing with a terrified baby alligator for your new album cover. Humans and alligators are not natural bedfellows, and the two should not mix at events such as photo shoots. In my view, doing so is arguably abusive to an animal."<ref>{{Cite web |last=TMZ Staff |title= PETA Wants Gator-aid From Beyoncé

[[File:Ring the Alarm video.jpg|thumb|right|Knowles struggling against guards in riot gear during the video|alt=A woman, who wears a golden coat and boots, is pulled and lifted off the floor by two police officers wearing black suits.]]
The video starts with Knowles laying on a table, lit with a flashing bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while dancing on the table. She proceeds to an interrogation room similar to the one in the film ''Basic Instinct''. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a corner of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only her lips.
