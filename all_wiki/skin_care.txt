'''Skin care''' is the range of practices that support skin integrity, enhance its appearance and relieve skin conditions. They can include nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure and appropriate use of emollients. Practices that enhance appearance include the use of [[cosmetics]], [[botulinum]], [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliation]], fillers, [[laser resurfacing]], [[microdermabrasion]], peels, [[retinol]] therapy<ref name=Penzer2010/> and ultrasonic skin treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/a19686286/ultrasonic-face-spatula-how-to/|title=Ultrasonic Face De-Gunking Spatulas Are a Thing and You're Going to Want One|last=Rodulfo|first=Kristina|date=2018-04-06|website=ELLE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> Skin care is a routine daily procedure in many settings, such as skin that is either too dry or too moist, and prevention of [[dermatitis]] and prevention of skin injuries.<ref name=Lichterfeld/>

Skin care is a part of the treatment of [[wound healing]], [[radiation therapy]] and some medications.

==Background==

Skin care is at the interface of [[cosmetics]],<ref name=Kessler2015/> and [[dermatology]], a traditional medical discipline;<ref name="randomHouse">''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.'' Random House, Inc. 2001. Page 537. {{ISBN|0-375-72026-X}}.</ref> there is some overlap with each of these topics.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams), although some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.<ref name=Kessler2015>Kessler R.

Skin care differs from [[dermatology]], as traditionally practiced, by its additional but less medical scope and by its inclusion of non-physician professionals, such as [[esthetician]]s and wound care nursing staff.<ref name=Penzer2010/><ref name=Schwanitz2003/> Skin care includes modifications of individual behavior and of environmental and working conditions.<ref name=Schwanitz2003/> Nevertheless, dermatology has co-opted some aspects of skin care, particularly in the U.S., and to a significantly lesser extent elsewhere, such as the U.K.<ref name=Penzer2010/> Add from<ref name=Penzer2010/><ref name=Lichterfeld/><ref name=Shai2009>Handbook of Cosmetic Skin Care Second Edition AVI SHAI, HOWARD I.

==Neonate==

Guidelines for neonatal skin care have been developed. Nevertheless, the pediatric and dermatologic communities have not reached consensus on best cleansing practices, as good [[levels of evidence|quality scientific evidence]] is scarce.<ref name=Blume-Peytavi2012/> Immersion in water seems superior to washing alone, and use of synthetic [[detergent]]s or mild liquid baby cleansers seems comparable or superior to water alone.<ref name=Blume-Peytavi2012/> Add from <ref name=Lund>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lund C, Kuller J, Lane A, Lott JW, Raines DA |title=Neonatal skin care: the scientific basis for practice |journal=Neonatal Netw |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=15–27 |year=1999 |pmid=10633681 |doi=10.1891/0730-0832.18.4.15 |s2cid=20122791 }}</ref><ref name="PMID 22988452">{{cite journal | pmid = 22988452 | doi=10.1155/2012/198789 | volume=2012 | title=The infant skin barrier: can we preserve, protect, and enhance the barrier? | year=2012 | journal=Dermatol Res Pract | pages=1–18 | pmc=3439947 | author=Telofski LS, Morello AP 3rd, Mack Correa MC, Stamatas GN}}</ref>

==Sunscreen==

{{Main|Sunscreen|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}
[[File:Woman applying sunscreen.jpg|thumb|A woman applying sunscreen]]
Sun protection is an important aspect of skin care. Though the sun is beneficial in order for the human body to get its daily dose of vitamin D, unprotected excessive sunlight can cause extreme damage to the skin. [[Ultraviolet]] (UVA and UVB) radiation in the sun's rays can cause sunburn in varying degrees, early ageing and increased risk of skin cancer.<ref name="PMID 2620876">{{cite journal | pmid = 26208767 | doi=10.1016/j.fsc.2015.04.002 | volume=23 | issue=3 | title=Skin Care. | date=Aug 2015 | journal=Facial Plast Surg Clin North Am | pages=285–95 |vauthors=Clark A, Hessler JL }}</ref> UV exposure can cause patches of uneven skin tone and dry out the skin.

This can reduce the skin's elasticity and encourage sagging and wrinkle formation. [[Sunscreen]] can protect the skin from sun damage; sunscreen should be applied at least 20 minutes before exposure, and should be re-applied every four hours. Sunscreen should be applied to all areas of the skin that will be exposed to sunlight, and at least a tablespoon (25&nbsp;ml) should be applied to each limb, the face, chest, and back, to ensure thorough coverage. Many tinted moisturizers, foundations and primers now contain some form of SPF.

Sunscreens may come in the form of creams, gels or lotions; their [[Sun protection factor|SPF]] number indicates their effectiveness in protecting the skin from the sun's radiation. There are sunscreens available to suit every skin type; in particular, those with oily skin should choose non-comedogenic sunscreens; those with dry skins should choose sunscreens with moisturizers to help keep skin hydrated, and those with sensitive skin should choose unscented, hypoallergenic sunscreen and spot-test in an inconspicuous place (such as the inside of the elbow or behind the ear) to ensure that it does not irritate the skin.

==Elderly==

Skin ageing is associated with increased vulnerability.<ref name=Kottner2013/> Skin problems including [[pruritus]] are common in the elderly but are often inadequately addressed.<ref name=Beauregard/> A literature review of studies that assessed maintenance of skin integrity in the elderly found most to be low [[levels of evidence]]<ref name=Kottner2013/> but the review concluded that skin-cleansing with synthetic [[detergent]]s or [[amphoterism|amphoteric]] [[surfactant]]s induced less skin dryness than using soap and water.<ref name=Kottner2013/> [[Moisturizer]]s with [[humectant]]s helped with skin dryness, and skin barrier occlusives reduced skin injuries.<ref name=Kottner2013/>

There is limited evidence that moisturising soap bar; combinations of water soak, oil soak, and lotion are effecrive in maintaining the skin integrity of elderly people when compared to standard care.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cowdell|first1=Fiona|last2=Jadotte|first2=Yuri T|last3=Ersser|first3=Steven J|last4=Danby|first4=Simon|last5=Lawton|first5=Sandra|last6=Roberts|first6=Amanda|last7=Dyson|first7=Judith|date=2020-01-23|editor-last=Cochrane Skin Group|title=Hygiene and emollient interventions for maintaining skin integrity in older people in hospital and residential care settings|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=1|pages=CD011377|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011377.pub2|pmid=32006460|pmc=6996088}}</ref>

According to the American Academy of Dermatology, between 40 and 50 million Americans suffer from acne each year.<ref name="aad.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.aad.org/practicecenter/quality/clinical-guidelines/acne|title=Acne clinical guideline|publisher=American Academy of Dermatology|date=2018}}</ref> While many associate acne with adolescence, acne can occur at any age, with its causes including heredity, hormones, menstruation, food, and emotional stress.<ref name="aad.org"/>

Those with inflammatory acne should exfoliate with caution as the procedure may make conditions worse and consult a dermatologist before treatment.<ref name="aad.org"/> Some anti-acne creams contain drying agents such as [[benzoyl peroxide]] (in concentrations of 2.5 - 10% ).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=333.310|title=Topical Acne Drug Products|publisher=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=1 April 2018}}</ref>

==Pressure sore==

When cleaning the stoma area, plain warm water should be use and dry wipe to gently clean around the stoma. Pat gently and make sure not to rub the area. Put all used wipes in a disposable bag and wash your hands after.

==Wound healing==

{{Main|Wound healing}}

Wound healing is a complex and fragile process in which the skin repairs itself after injury. It is susceptible to interruption or failure that creates non-healing chronic wounds.<ref name=Flanagan/>

==Radiation==

Radiation induces skin reactions in the treated area, particularly in the [[axilla]], head and neck, [[perineum]] and skin fold regions.<ref name=Herst2014/> Formulations with moisturising, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and wound healing properties are often used, but no preferred approach or individual product has been identified as best practice.<ref name=Herst2014/><ref name=McQuestion2006/> Soft silicone dressings that act as barriers to friction may be helpful.<ref name=Herst2014/> In breast cancer, [[calendula]] cream may reduce the severity of radiation effects on the dark spot corrector.<ref name=McQuestion2006/><ref name=McQuestion2011/> [[Deodorant]] use after completing radiation treatment has been controversial but is now recommended for practice.<ref name=McQuestion2011/> Add from<ref name=Aistars2006>{{cite journal | pmid = 16927902 | doi=10.1188/06.CJON.487-492 | volume=10 | issue=4 | title=The validity of skin care protocols followed by women with breast cancer receiving external radiation. | date=Aug 2006 | journal=Clin J Oncol Nurs | pages=487–92 | author=Aistars J}}</ref><ref name=Bolderston2006/><ref name="PMID 20598015">{{cite journal | pmid = 20598015 | doi=10.1111/j.1754-9485.2010.02170.x | volume=54 | issue=3 | title=Management of skin toxicity during radiation therapy: a review of the evidence. | date=Jun 2010 | journal=J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol | pages=264–79 |vauthors=Kumar S, Juresic E, Barton M, Shafiq J }}</ref><ref name=Trueman2015>{{cite journal |authors=Trueman E |title=Management of radiotherapy-induced skin reactions |journal=Int J Palliat Nurs |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=187–92 |year=2015 |pmid=25901591 |doi=10.12968/ijpn.2015.21.4.187 }}</ref>

==EGFR==

[[Epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR) inhibitors are medications used in cancer treatment. These medications commonly cause skin and nail problems, including rashes, dry skin and [[paronychia]].<ref name=Califano2015/> Preventive intensive moisturising with emollient ointments several times, avoidance of water-based creams and water soaks (although in certain circumstances white vinegar or potassium permanganate soaks may help), protection the skin from excessive exposure to sunshine, and soap substitutes which are less dehydrating for the skin than normal soaps, as well as shampoos that reduce the risk of scalp folliculitis, are recommended. Treatment measures with topical antibiotic medication can be helpful.<ref name=Califano2015/><ref name=Thatcher2009/><ref name=Kiyohara2013/> <!--evidence PO abx--><!-- add Ab refs-->

==Related products==
{{Main|Cosmeceutical|Nutricosmetics}}
[[Cosmeceutical]]s are topically-applied, combination products that bring together [[cosmetics]] and "biologically active ingredients". Products which are similar in perceived benefits but ingested orally are known as [[nutricosmetics]]. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration ([[FDA]]), the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act "does not recognize any such category as "cosmeceuticals." A product can be a drug, a cosmetic, or a combination of both, but the term "cosmeceutical" has no meaning under the law". Drugs are subject to an intensive review and approval process by FDA. Cosmetics, and these related products, although regulated, are not approved by FDA prior to sale.
