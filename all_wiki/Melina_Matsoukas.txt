==Early life and education==
Matsoukas grew up in the [[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]] housing development in the Bronx. Her father worked as a builder,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/melina-matsoukas-went-music-video-170014647.html|title=How Melina Matsoukas Went From Music-Video Visionary to 'Queen and Slim'|website=www.yahoo.com}}</ref> and her mother taught math in a local high school. When Matsoukas was eight, the family moved to Hackensack, New Jersey. Her father is of half Greek and half Jewish descent, and her mother is of [[Afro-Cuban]] and [[Afro-Jamaican]] descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/06/the-provocateur-behind-beyonce-rihanna-and-issa-rae|title=The Provocateur Behind Beyonce Rihanna and Issa Rae|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712220838/http://www.honeymag.com/2010/uncategorized/females-freakin-the-industry/|archivedate=July 12, 2011|url-status=bot: unknown|accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/2019/11/22/from-beyonce-to-the-big-screen-the-whirlwind-rise-of-melina-matsoukas|title=From Beyoncé to the big screen: the whirlwind rise of Melina Matsoukas|via=The Economist}}</ref> Both her name and surname are {{Lang-el|Μελίνα Ματσούκα}}''.''

[http://www.nation.co.ke/magazines/buzz/-/441236/468006/-/id9wc4z/-/index.html "Video queen: Melina Matsoukas"], ''Daily Nation''.</ref>

==Career==
Matsoukas started out at Black Dog Film, then the now-defunct Gorilla Flix film production company, and is currently a director at Prettybird, which she has been signed to since 2011.

Her work is described as "chock full of bright colors or crisp black and white images, smooth spotlights, and tasteful retro video models."<ref>[http://watchlooklisten.e-fans.net/?p=46 "Visionary: Melina Matsoukas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118061831/http://watchlooklisten.e-fans.net/?p=46 |date=January 18, 2008 }}, ''WatchLookListen''.</ref> Matsoukas says that expensive equipment is not necessary for a quality video and one should never think that way: "A good video has the right visuals, a well [[concept art|conceptualised]] story and should be exciting and elicit reaction."<ref>Banda, Tim Kamuzu (2008). [http://www.nation.co.ke/magazines/buzz/-/441236/468006/-/item/1/-/jo324sz/-/index.html "Video queen: Melina Matsoukas"], p.2, ''Daily Nation''.</ref> In an interview for ''[[Venus Zine]]'s'' Fall 2010 issue, she says about being part of the music video world, "I love it. The quick turnaround, the creativity."<ref>"Venus Zine:  Melina Matsoukas" ''Venus Zine'' Fall 2010 Issue No. 44</ref>

In 2016 and 2017, Matsoukas directed several episodes of the critically and publicly acclaimed television series ''[[Master of None]]'' and [[Insecure (TV series)|''Insecure'']].

Matsoukas made her directorial debut in film with ''[[Queen & Slim]]'', starring [[Jodie Turner-Smith]] and [[Daniel Kaluuya]], and written by [[Lena Waithe]]. It was released on November 27, 2019, by [[Universal Pictures]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/jodie-smith-turner-queen-and-slim-daniel-kaluuya-1203022499/|title=Jodie Turner-Smith to Star Opposite Daniel Kaluuya in 'Queen & Slim' (EXCLUSIVE)|first1=Justin|last1=Kroll|date=November 8, 2018}}</ref>
