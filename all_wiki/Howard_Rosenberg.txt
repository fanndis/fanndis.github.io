Rosenberg argued:
: if one word characterizes TV-driven popular culture, it's excess – the steroidal massing that comes from going too far, artificially swelling something beyond what's natural.<ref>Terry Eastland, ed. ''Forbes Media Guide Five Hundred, 1994: A Critical Review of the Media'' (1994) p 110.</ref>

The ''Forbes Media Guide Five Hundred, 1994'' states:  
:Smart and perceptive, Rosenberg crafts stylish reviews of TV shows and trends, producing columns both witty and quotable.... Tuned in to both TV and the outside world, Rosenberg provides the caviar of critiques.<ref>Terry Eastland, ed. ''Forbes Media Guide Five Hundred, 1994: A Critical Review of the Media'' (1994) pp 110-11.</ref>
