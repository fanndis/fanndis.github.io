'''New Kids on the Block''' (also initialized as '''NKOTB''') is an American [[boy band]] from [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]], United States. The band consists of brothers [[Jonathan Knight|Jonathan]] and [[Jordan Knight]], [[Joey McIntyre]], [[Donnie Wahlberg]], and [[Danny Wood]]. New Kids on the Block enjoyed success in the late 1980s and early 1990s and have sold more than 70 million records worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.dispatch.com/article/20110724/ENTERTAINMENT/307249799|title=Back on the block |work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]] |access-date=July 24, 2018}}</ref> They won two [[American Music Award]]s in 1990 for Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group and Favorite Pop/Rock Album.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Claudia |author2=Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline |title=Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia|url=https://archive.org/details/girlcultureencyc00mitc|url-access=limited|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/girlcultureencyc00mitc/page/n485 453]|isbn=0-313-33908-2}}</ref> The group disbanded in 1994, and publicly reunited in 2008.

==History==
===1984–1985: Early career===
In the early 1980s, [[Maurice Starr]] discovered [[R&B]]/[[pop music|pop]] quintet [[New Edition]], and guided their early success. After breaking ties with them, Starr and his business partner, Mary Alford, sought to create a white counterpart act. Fifteen-year-old [[Donnie Wahlberg]] impressed Starr and Alford with his rapping skills, becoming the group's first member.<ref name="Biography.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/news/new-kids-on-the-block-origins|author=Sara Kettler|title=New Kids on the Block: The Hurdles They Overcame Before Enjoying Pop Music Success|work=[[Biography.com]]|date=September 9, 2020|accessdate=December 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name="pop bonanza">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/11/arts/pop-view-white-singers-black-style-pop-bonanza.html|title=POP VIEW; White Singers + Black Style - Pop Bonanza|first=Peter|last=Watrous|date=March 11, 1990|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref><ref name="puberty to platinum">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/new-kids-on-the-block-from-puberty-to-platinum-112529/|author=David Wild|title=New Kids on the Block: From Puberty to Platinum|work=Rolling Stone|date=November 2, 1989|accessdate=December 4, 2020}}</ref> He was initially joined by his younger brother [[Mark Wahlberg|Mark]], who left the group after only a few months.<ref name="Biography.com"/><ref name=heartthrobs>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118457,00.html|title=The Heartthrobs of America |last=Dougherty|first=Steve |date=August 13, 1990|magazine=People|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Ten Things">{{cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/ten-things-we-learned-about-new-kids-on-the-block-from-their-new-biography/|author=Sarah Fenske|title=TEN THINGS WE LEARNED ABOUT NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK FROM THEIR NEW BIOGRAPHY|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=October 16, 2012|accessdate=December 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Boston days">{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2012/09/29/new-kids-block-their-early-boston-days/QkknuflO1Uy45M0xDmOIPP/story.html|author=Nikki Van Noy|title=New Kids on the Block: Their early Boston days|work=The Boston Globe|date=September 30, 2012|accessdate=December 5, 2020}}</ref> Donnie then recruited his school friends Jamie Kelly, [[Jordan Knight]], and [[Danny Wood]] to join the group; Knight was followed into the group by his older brother [[Jonathan Knight|Jonathan]], while Kelly left the group early on.<ref name="Encyclopedia Johnson"/><ref name="Biography.com"/><ref name="heartthrobs"/>

===1986–1987: ''New Kids on the Block'' (debut album)===
{{Main article|New Kids on the Block (album)}}
In April 1986, Columbia Records released the group's self-titled debut album. The album, almost exclusively written and produced by Maurice Starr, featured mid 80s [[bubblegum pop]] material. The first single, "[[Be My Girl (New Kids on the Block song)|Be My Girl]]", received minor airplay around the group's native Boston, but failed to capture nationwide attention. The album's second single, "[[Stop It Girl]]", fared even worse. The New Kids went on tour around the New England states, singing wherever Starr could book them: in bars, school dances, and clubs. Nevertheless, Starr remained diligent and persuaded the label to allow the group to record a second album.

===1988–1989: ''Hangin' Tough''===
{{Main article|Hangin' Tough}}
After the failure of the first album, Starr had the group back in the studio for most of 1987 and 1988 recording their second album. Dissatisfied with the excessively bubblegum sound of their first album, the group wanted to have more input on their look, direction and song material. As a result, Wahlberg, Wood and Jordan Knight received [[associate producer]] credit on the final product. The album's first single was "[[Please Don't Go Girl]]", a ballad released in the spring of 1988. Failure seemed destined a second time when the song became another that went unnoticed by the listening public, and Columbia Records made plans to drop the New Kids from the label. At the eleventh hour, however, a pop radio station in Florida began playing the song. Scoring listener approval, it soon became the most requested song on their play list. When Columbia caught wind of the positive response, they decided to keep the group on its roster and put more effort into promoting the single. Columbia decided to re-shoot a music video for "Please Don't Go Girl", hiring director [[Doug Nichol]], and sent the video to thousands of radio stations across the country to show the group's visual appeal. National attention soon followed and "Please Don't Go Girl" eventually climbed to No. 10 on [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard's Hot 100 Singles Chart]]—becoming the group's first hit.<ref name="billboard">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=new kids on the block|chart=all}}|title=Artist Chart History – New Kids on the Block|publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}</ref>

New Kids on the Block's second album, ''Hangin' Tough'', was released to modest fanfare in September. In the meantime, the group began making national televised appearances on such music programs as ''[[Showtime at the Apollo]]'', and ''[[Soul Train]]''. Producer Maurice Starr then held auditions to secure a band of musicians suitable for touring with the New Kids approving musical director and Keyboardist Greg McPherson, bassist [[David Dyson (musician)|David Dyson]], keyboardist Yasko Kubota, guitarist Nerida Rojas, and drummer Derrick Antunes. The New Kids later landed a spot as an opening act for fellow teen-pop act [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]] on the U.S. leg of her concert tour. Sales of ''Hangin' Tough'' steadily increased as the group's national attention slowly rose. At year's end, the album's second single "[[You Got It (The Right Stuff)]]" was released. The song was given a huge boost when [[MTV]] took notice of the group and began playing the video in regular rotation, including an appearance on [[Club MTV]]. By early 1989, it cracked the top five.<ref name="billboard" /> The New Kids hit pay dirt with their next single, "[[I'll Be Loving You (Forever)]]", which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart in June.<ref name="billboard" /> The group had been scheduled to open for Tiffany once again on a [[Hangin' Tough Tour|second tour]], but their sudden popularity caused a reversal, and she wound up opening for them (although the two acts were technically billed as "co-headliners").

More top five singles from ''Hangin' Tough'' followed into the summer and fall, including [[Hangin' Tough (song)|the title track]] and "[[Cover Girl (New Kids on the Block song)|Cover Girl]]". Columbia Records also released the single "[[Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)]]" (a cover of [[The Delfonics]]' classic hit), from the group's previously overlooked debut album. The song went No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles<ref name="billboard" /> on the strength of the group's popularity and effectively jump-started the sales of that album as well. By the end of 1989, ''Hangin' Tough'' had climbed to number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] Albums Chart and had gone eight-times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]. They, subsequently, became the first 'teen' act to garner five top ten hits from a single album.

Meanwhile, a top ten charting [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday]] album, ''[[Merry, Merry Christmas]]'', was released in the fall—spawning another top 10 hit, "[[This One's for the Children]]" and going double platinum in the U.S. The proceeds were donated to [[United Cerebral Palsy]], the New Kids' favorite charitable cause. ''Hangin' Tough'' would go on to spend 132 weeks on the chart, and in January 1990, the album won two [[American Music Awards of 1990|American Music Awards]] for "Best Pop/Rock Album", and "Best Pop/Rock Group". With the success of "Didn't I (Blow Your Mind)", "Cover Girl", and "This One's For the Children", the group pulled off a rare feat of having three singles on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time, but each from a different album.

Columbia Music Video also released a home video "Hangin' Tough", a documentary on the band directed by [[Doug Nichol]] and produced by Bryan Johnson, that included their four hit music videos and a live concert recorded during their 1989 tour. It achieved massive sales, earning a [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]] nomination,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/videos.htm |title=Grammy Awards: Best Music Videos |publisher=Rock On The Net |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> and was one of the biggest selling music videos of all time.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/22/business/the-media-business-new-products-help-to-bolster-music-sales.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; New Products Help to Bolster Music Sales | first=Geraldine | last=Fabrikant | date=October 22, 1990 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts declared April 24, 1989, "New Kids on the Block Day".

===1990–1993: ''Step by Step'' and lip syncing allegations===
{{Main article|Step by Step (New Kids on the Block album)}}
By early 1990, New Kids on the Block had become one of the most popular acts in the United States. The following May, they followed up ''Hangin' Tough'' with ''Step by Step'', which featured slightly more than half of the songs co-written and produced by the members themselves. The first single, [[Step by Step (New Kids on the Block song)|the title track]], raced to number one on the Hot 100 Singles Chart<ref name="billboard" /> and became their biggest selling single. It was followed up with the top ten "[[Tonight (New Kids on the Block song)|Tonight]]", which extended the consecutive top ten singles chart run to nine records. "Let's Try It Again" hit No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst "Baby I Believe In You" went No. 1 on the Japanese Chart, further signifying the international appeal of the group. The album was eventually certified triple platinum, selling close to 20 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=new kids on the block|bio=true}}|title=Artist Biography – New Kids on the Block|last= Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|author2=Leahey, Andrew |publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}</ref>

The group performed an estimated two hundred concerts a year, with an extravagant worldwide concert tour that summer, called ''[[The Magic Summer Tour]]'', sponsored by [[Coca-Cola|Coke]]. The tour ultimately grossed $74 million ($133 million, adjusted for inflation), making the group the top-grossing touring act in the country at the time and one of highest-grossing concert tours of the decade. The tour had an overall attendance of 3.2 million people. Their 1990 [[Pay-per-view|pay-per-view special]] broke cable-TV history at the time. During this time, the group became heavily merchandised. NKOTB-licensed merchandise included [[lunch box]]es, [[Badge|buttons]], T-shirts, [[comic books]], [[Celebrity doll|dolls]], trading cards and even a [[Saturday morning cartoon]] in their likeness, which was developed by the writing and development team from [[Pangea Corporation]] and animated by [[DIC Entertainment]]. In 1991, sales for the group's merchandise were estimated at [[United States dollar|US$]]400 million.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=P.

New Kids on the Block's official fan club had a membership of over 200,000 members and was one of the largest fan clubs in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Jay|title=American Singing Groups: A History from 1940 to Today|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/americansingingg00warn/page/529 529]|isbn=0-634-09978-7|url=https://archive.org/details/americansingingg00warn/page/529}}</ref> Approximately 100,000 calls per week were dialed to 1-900-909-5KIDs, the Official NKOTB Hotline, as well. In 1991, the group topped ''[[Forbes]]'' list of highest paid entertainers, beating out the likes of Michael Jackson, [[Madonna]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Bill Cosby]].<ref name=bostonglobe>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/04/05/around_the_block_again_for_new_kids_fans/|title=Around the block again for New Kids, fans|last=Goldstein |first=Meredith |author2=Rodman, Sarah |date=April 5, 2008|newspaper=The Boston Globe|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}</ref> Further capitalizing on the fame, at year's end, Columbia Records released ''[[No More Games/The Remix Album]]''—a compilation of the group's biggest hits remixed, the album also brought along two more released songs in "[[Call It What You Want (New Kids on the Block song)|Call It What You Want]]" (UK #12) and "[[Games (New Kids on the Block song)|Games]]" (UK #14) in which videos were also released.

The group released no new material in 1991, but went overseas and continued to tour throughout Europe and Asia. That summer, Wood and Wahlberg co-wrote and produced the debut album from [[Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch]]—headed by Mark Wahlberg, Donnie's brother and former New Kid. Mark Wahlberg's album scored a number one hit with "[[Good Vibrations (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch song)|Good Vibrations]]", and a platinum album.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir|author2=Woodstra, Chris|author3=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|others=Bush, John|title=All Music Guide to Hip-Hop: The Definitive Guide to Rap & Hip-Hop|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780879307592/page/304 304]|isbn=0-87930-759-5|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780879307592/page/304}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Brackett|first=Nathan|author2=Hoard, Christian|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide: Completely Revised and Updated 4th Edition|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/514 514]|isbn=0-7432-0169-8|url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/514}}</ref>

By late 1990, David Dyson assumed the role of musical director. In early 1992, the group released the stand-alone single "[[If You Go Away (New Kids on the Block song)|If You Go Away]]", the only new track on the compilation ''[[H.I.T.S.]]''. The song peaked at No. 16 on the US charts and No. 9 in the UK charts. Meanwhile, as the music industry was still reeling from the [[Milli Vanilli]] [[Lip sync|lip-syncing]] scandal, the group found themselves accused of lip-syncing by Gregory McPherson, also a music teacher at [[Berklee College of Music]], who was listed as an associate producer and string arranger on the group's third album, ''Step by Step''. McPherson alleged that Maurice Starr sang the vocals while the group lip-synced to pre-recorded vocals during their live performances. McPherson also filed a [[breach of contract]] and creative infringement lawsuit against Starr.

The group immediately responded to the allegations and interrupted the Australian leg of their tour to fly to Los Angeles to perform live on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]].''<ref>{{cite news|title= New Kids on the Block Let Singing Do the Talking|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=February 6, 1992|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-06/local/me-2060_1_arsenio-hall-show|accessdate=October 9, 2010 | first=Steve | last=Hochman}}</ref> After performing a medley of their previous hits and their new single, the group (along with Starr) was interviewed by Hall.

On February 10, 1992, the New Kids filed a [[defamation]] lawsuit against McPherson regarding his lip-syncing allegations. In April 1992, McPherson dropped his suit against Starr and released a statement recanting his previous allegations stating, "They [The New Kids] did sing lead on their vocals".<ref name="#1hits" />

By the time the lip-syncing allegations surfaced, the group was starting to experience a [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]]. Despite their success, the group was regularly dismissed by critics for their attempts to promote themselves as an [[Hip hop culture|urban act]] and their practice of using backing vocals for live performances. The group's record sales also began to decline due to a shift in musical tastes to [[gangsta rap]] and [[grunge|grunge music]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200890|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710145432/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200890|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 10, 2012|title=The New Kids on the Block |last=King |first=Jason |publisher=findarticles.com|accessdate=September 23, 2008 | year=2002}}</ref>

===1993–1994: ''Face the Music'' and split===
{{Main article|Face the Music (New Kids on the Block album)}}
In 1993, after having split from Maurice Starr, the group shortened their name to the [[initialism]] NKOTB. In January 1994, their fourth studio album, ''Face the Music'', was released. Their first studio album in close to four years, ''Face the Music'' was a musical departure from the group's previous efforts. Nearly all the songs were written and/or co-produced by the group. In spite of some positive critical reception, the album failed to live up to commercial expectation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/boyz-to-men-the-not-so-new--kids-on-the-block-938740.html|title=Boyz to men: The (not so) New – Kids on the Block|date=September 23, 2008|newspaper=independent.co.uk|accessdate=September 23, 2008 | location=London}}</ref> The album's final single to chart was "[[Dirty Dawg]]" (which featured a rap cameo by [[Nice & Smooth]]), peaking at No. 66 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref name="billboard" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Mayer |first=Andrea |title=Take That, take 2: A Boy Band Does the Inconceivable: Makes a Successful Comeback |date=March 7, 2007 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/take_that.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311225918/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/take_that.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 11, 2007 |accessdate=January 26, 2008 |work=CBC News }}</ref> The follow-up single, "[[Never Let You Go (New Kids on the Block song)|Never Let You Go]]", failed to chart in the U.S., but did reach No. 42 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and No. 18 in the [[Canada|Canadian]] charts.

NKOTB went on tour to support the album, playing smaller venues such as clubs and theaters, as opposed to the arenas and stadiums they were once accustomed to. After experiencing increased [[panic attacks]] and anxiety, Jonathan Knight left the band. Shortly thereafter, the remaining four decided to officially disband the group.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20132995,00.html|title=Renewed Kid |last=Tauber|first=Michelle |date=November 20, 2000|magazine=People|accessdate=September 23, 2008}}</ref>

After the group's split, most of the group members started families and began to venture into other avenues. Jonathan Knight and Danny Wood maintained low profiles, while the other three continued their careers individually. Wahlberg, in particular, followed the lead of his younger brother, [[Mark Wahlberg]], and started an acting career. McIntyre and Jordan Knight recorded solo albums in 1999. In 1999, MTV attempted to reunite the group and get them to perform on that year's [[MTV Video Music Awards|VMAs]]. All of the members were on board for the project, except Jonathan. Without him, the performance did not happen.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bottomley |first=C. |title=Older Kids on the Comeback |date=April 30, 2001 |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1443264/20010430/new_kids_on_the_block.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131122150/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1443264/20010430/new_kids_on_the_block.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 31, 2007 |accessdate=January 26, 2008 }}</ref> In 2004, [[Aamer Haleem]], host of VH1's ''[[Bands Reunited]]'', also attempted to convince each of the members of New Kids on the Block to reunite for a one-night performance for the show. This time Jonathan agreed. However, McIntyre, Wahlberg, and Wood all declined. While Wood and Wahlberg declined on-camera interviews, McIntyre cited that the only way he would perform with the band was if the group would make the decision to reunite permanently.<ref>{{cite news|title=Group Therapy: VH1 struggles to get ''Bands Reunited''| url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,688817,00.html| accessdate =January 26, 2008 | work=Entertainment Weekly| date=September 3, 2004}}</ref>
