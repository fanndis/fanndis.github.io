'''Big Machine Records''' is an American [[independent record label]], which is distributed by [[Universal Music Group]] and specializes in [[Country music|country]] and [[Pop music|pop]] artists. Big Machine is based on Music Row in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The label was founded in September 2005<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Caulfiend|first1=Keith|last2=Tucker|first2=Ken|title=Valory Unveiled|journal=Billboard|date=November 10, 2007|volume=119|issue=45|page=8}}</ref> by former [[DreamWorks Records]] executive [[Scott Borchetta]] and became a joint venture between Borchetta and country singer [[Toby Keith]].<ref name="Stark">{{cite journal|last=Stark|first=Phyllis|date=March 11, 2006|title=The Honeymoon's Hardly Over, but Show Dog and Big Machine split|journal=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12}}</ref> The company concentrates on publishing, management, and merchandising and oversees imprints, such as Valory Music, that are part of the [[Big Machine Records#Imprints|Big Machine Label Group]].

==History==
[[Scott Borchetta]] is originally from Los Angeles, California's [[San Fernando Valley]] area ("The Valley"), and he played bass guitar in [[punk rock]] bands in his younger years. Borchetta's father, Mike Borchetta, worked in Nashville as a country promoter who courted radio stations with music he transported in the trunk of his car. Mike Borchetta was married to an aspiring country singer at the time, as he had divorced Scott's mother. Borchetta did not leave Nashville after a 1981 visit.<ref name="Scott">{{cite web|author1=Devin Leonard|title=Taylor Swift Is the Music Industry|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-11-12/taylor-swift-and-big-machine-are-the-music-industry|website=Bloomberg Businessweek|publisher=Bloomberg L.P|accessdate=January 10, 2015|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref>

Borchetta worked in the mailroom of his father's music company and eventually became a promotions staff member in 1991 for [[Universal Music Group]]'s [[MCA Records]]. According to ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', Borchetta was an "involved manager" at MCA, "choosing singles and dispensing advice." After he was fired from MCA in 1997, Borchetta accepted a role at the Nashville division of [[DreamWorks Records]], but later decided to start his own label after Universal acquired the division.<ref name="Scott" />

Before he left DreamWorks, Borchetta approached [[Taylor Swift]] and her family after the musician performed at the [[Bluebird Café]] in Nashville, Tennessee after first meeting her in 2004. At the time, Borchetta had no infrastructure or financing. He made an offer to Swift and her parents, whereby he would recruit her to the new label's roster after it was established. Swift eventually recontacted Borchetta around two weeks later, telling him: "I'm waiting for you."<ref name="Scott" />

He formed the label in 2005, naming it "Big Machine" after a 2004 song by the band [[Velvet Revolver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6738578/scott-borchetta-big-machine-10-year-anniversary-interview |title= Big Machine's Scott Borchetta on Taylor Swift, the Fight Against Free and Remaining 'Bold and Disruptive' on 10-Year Anniversary | first = Chris | last = Willman | date = October 26, 2015 |work=Billboard|accessdate=May 7, 2020}}</ref> Soon after he released Swift's first ever recording, the single "[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]]" and her debut album ''[[Taylor Swift (album)|Taylor Swift]]''. Keith dropped his affiliation with the label in 2006, but he was reported as an equity holder in November 2014, alongside the Swift family and Borchetta (the latter reportedly owned 60 percent of the business at the time). In October 2012, Borchetta told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine: "[Taylor Swift’s father] Scott Swift owns three percent of Big Machine."<ref name="Stark" /><ref name="Scott" /><ref>{{cite web|author1=Brian Hiatt|title=Taylor Swift in Wonderland|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-in-wonderland-20121025|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 10, 2015|date=October 25, 2012}}</ref>

By March 2009, Big Machine artist [[Danielle Peck]] had left the label. The departure occurred during a downturn period for the overall U.S. music industry.<ref name="cmt09">{{cite web|author1=Edward Morris|title=Country Rosters Remain Stable Despite Sales Downturn|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1606224/country-rosters-remain-stable-despite-sales-downturn/|website=CMT News|accessdate=January 10, 2015|date=March 3, 2009}}</ref>

In February [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards|2010]], Swift won 4 [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]—including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] (''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]''), [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]] (''Fearless''), [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]] ([[White Horse (Taylor Swift song)|"White Horse"]]), and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance|Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] ("White Horse")—becoming the first Big Machine artist to win a Grammy Award.

Borchetta signed a deal with Clear Channel—which later changed its name to iHeartMedia—in 2012 that ensures payment for Big Machine artists from terrestrial and digital radio airplay. Three years after the deal was signed, Borchetta said that the revenue streams were "very meaningful."<ref name="New" />

In response to a claim that Borchetta was seeking a sum of US$200&nbsp;million for Big Machine since the release of Swift's fifth studio album ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'', the label head refuted the claim in November 2014: "Every time we have a Taylor [Swift] record, they're like, 'Oh, he's selling the company.'" However, Borchetta did not rule out a future change of ownership, stating that "the business is changing so quickly, and if I see a strategic opportunity that's going to be better for our artists and executives, it's going to be a serious conversation."<ref name="Scott" /> Following the release of ''1989'', her Big Machine contract required her to produce one more full-length album for the label.<ref name="Scott" />

The [[Zac Brown Band]] announced on January 12, 2015, that it had finalized a four-way strategic partnership involving the Southern Ground Artists record label, Big Machine Label Group, [[Republic Records]] and John Varvatos Records for the release of its fourth studio album. The terms of the deal state that Zac Brown Band will work with Big Machine Label Group for marketing and distribution, while Southern Ground Artists will work on radio promotion, Republic will provide support in the area of non-country radio formats and international promotion, and Varvatos will oversee branding and styling. Borchetta was quoted in the Big Machine press release as saying that there is "literally no ceiling" to what can be achieved by the new partnership, and also spoke of "moments when our best artists hit a global stride and a deeper sense of engagement that speaks a clearer musical language".<ref name="Zac">{{cite web|author1=Nate Rau|title=Zac Brown Band aligns with Big Machine|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/music/2015/01/12/zac-brown-band-aligns-big-machine/21649505/|website=The Tennessean|publisher=The Tennessean|accessdate=January 17, 2015|date=January 12, 2015}}</ref>

In a February 2015 interview, Borchetta refused to comment on the status of the label's distribution deal with [[Universal Music Group]] (UMG), which was up for renegotiation at the time. He confirmed that the label would release the next ''American Idol'' album, in partnership with 19 Entertainment and UMG—Borchetta would be one of the mentors on the reality program's next series. Borchetta also disclosed that Swift agreed to the withdrawal of her catalog from Spotify after he first suggested the idea to her, and that he would remove the music of all Big Machine artists if it was within his power.<ref name="New" />

In May 2017, the label branched out into the [[alcoholic beverage]] industry by launching Big Machine Vodka, a premium brand distilled in [[Lynnville, Tennessee]]. Borchetta described the new venture as "perfectly [complimenting] the music we take such great pride in".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7809765/big-machine-vodka-scott-borchetta|title=Scott Borchetta's Big Machine Launches Vodka Brand|website=Billboard|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>

In November 2017, Swift released her sixth studio album ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'', her last album released under Big Machine. After this album, Swift refused to renew her contract with the label. She eventually stayed in Universal Music Group, Big Machine's distributor, and on November 19, 2018, after her contract with Big Machine expired, Swift signed with [[Republic Records]], under a deal in which she would maintain ownership of her masters going forward.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-universal-republic-deal-spotify-758102/|title=Taylor Swift's New Record Deal Affects Thousands of Other Musicians|last=Wang|first=Amy X.|date=November 19, 2018|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=November 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/taylor-swift-stands-to-make-music-business-history-as-a-free-agent-1202918336/|title=Taylor Swift Stands to Make Music Business History as a Free Agent|last=Willman|first=Chris|date=August 27, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=August 29, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/taylor-swift-news-alert-1203032124/|title=Taylor Swift Signs New Deal With Universal Music Group|last1=Aswad|first1=Jem|date=November 19, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=November 19, 2018|last2=Willman|first2=Chris}}</ref>

===Spotify issue===
On November 3, 2014, Swift removed all but one of her songs from Spotify after indications of her disapproval of the streaming service emerged in July of the same year. Swift, statistically one of the world's most popular music artists at the time, had previously delayed the streaming of her 2012 album, ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]''.<ref name="Lin">{{cite news|author1=Jack Linshi|date=November 3, 2014|title=Here's Why Taylor Swift Pulled Her Music From Spotify|website=TIME|publisher=TIME, Inc|url=http://time.com/3554468/why-taylor-swift-spotify/|accessdate=January 23, 2015}}</ref>

Big Machine country music artists Justin Moore and Brantley Gilbert removed their music from Spotify on November 12, 2014. Like Swift, both artists allowed a single song to remain on the streaming platform.<ref>{{cite news|date=November 12, 2014|title=Justin Moore, Brantley Gilbert pull music from Spotify|work=Toronto Sun|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2014/11/12/justin-moore-brantley-gilbert-pull-music-from-spotify|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref>

After Swift and Big Machine withdrew her catalog from Spotify in November 2014, the streaming service launched a social media campaign to persuade Swift to return and, in a statement on its website, claimed that 16&nbsp;million of over 40&nbsp;million users had played her music in the preceding 30-day period.<ref name="Tod">{{cite news|author1=Brian Mansfield|title=Taylor Swift says goodbye to Spotify|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/11/03/taylor-swift-spotify-removes-music/18428325/|accessdate=January 23, 2015|work=USA Today|date=November 4, 2014}}</ref>

In mid-November, Borchetta disputed figures released by Spotify that claimed that Swift would receive US$6&nbsp;million annually from the streaming site—Borchetta said in a ''TIME'' magazine interview that Swift was paid a total of US$500,000 over the previous 12 months. Spotify responded to Borchetta, by clarifying that Swift had been paid US$2&nbsp;million for global streaming over the year-long time frame. Spotify further explained: "We [Spotify] paid Taylor [Swift]'s label and publisher roughly half a million dollars in the month before she took her catalog down".<ref name="Tod" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/13/7213775/taylor-swift-spotify-borchetta-royalties|title=Spotify says it paid Taylor Swift millions. Her label disagrees. Here's the truth|work=The Verge|date=November 13, 2014}}</ref> According to Borchetta, the amount Swift earned from streaming her music videos on the [[Vevo]] site was greater than the payout she received from Spotify.

Borchetta then clarified in a February 2015 interview that Swift's catalog would be permitted on a streaming service "that understands the different needs that we [Swift and Big Machine] have," whereby "the choice to be [on the free, ad-supported tier] or not" is provided. Borchetta argued that Swift's musical oeuvre is "arguably the most important current catalog there is" and stated that the streaming issue is "about each individual artist, and the real mission here is to bring ... attention to it."<ref name="New">{{cite web|author1=Melinda Newman|title=Taylor Swift's Label Boss on Her Future, His Spotify Showdown and 'American Idol'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/taylor-swifts-label-boss-her-769072|website=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=February 14, 2015|date=February 5, 2015}}</ref>

Taylor Swift's catalog returned to Spotify in June 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/nation-now/2017/06/09/taylor-swift-returning-her-music-spotify/383280001/|title=Taylor Swift returning her music to Spotify|website=USA TODAY}}</ref>

=== The Purchase of Big Machine Label Group ===
In October 2018, Big Machine was placed for sale, with bids from [[Macquarie Group]], [[Evan Spiegel]] and [[Universal Music Group]]. Big Machine was valued at $300&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web|date=October 30, 2018|title=Universal Is Only Major Label Left in Running to Buy Taylor Swift's Big Machine Label Group, as Bids Top $300M|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/8482513/universal-is-only-major-label-left-in-running-to-buy-taylor-swifts-big-machine|access-date=June 30, 2019|website=Billboard}}</ref>

On July 30, 2019, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] reported that [[Scooter Braun]] had purchased Big Machine Records for $300 million with the help from Ithaca Holdings.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Scooter Braun Acquires Scott Borchetta's Big Machine Label Group, Taylor Swift Catalog For Over $300 Million|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8518119/scooter-braun-acquires-big-machine-label-group-scott-borchetta|access-date=2020-11-29|website=Billboard|language=en}}</ref> A few hours after the announcement of the purchase, Taylor Swift voiced her fustration on [[Tumblr]] that she was unaware of the buyer and who's hands her masters of the her first six albums were in.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Taylor Swift|url=https://taylorswift.tumblr.com/post/185958366550/for-years-i-asked-pleaded-for-a-chance-to-own-my|access-date=2020-11-29|website=Taylor Swift}}</ref> Later that night, Scott Borchetta revealed through the Big Machine Label Group website of his and Swifts conversation regarding the purchase.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-06-30|title=So, It’s Time For Some Truth…|url=https://www.bigmachinelabelgroup.com/news/so-its-time-some-truth|access-date=2020-11-29|website=Big Machine Label Group|language=en}}</ref> A copyright issue arose later in the year just ahead of Swift's [[American Music Awards]]' Artist of the Decade performance. Swift again voiced her anger via Twitter regarding Big Machine's action of prohibiting the use of her old music.

===Valory Music Co.===
In November 2007, Big Machine Records founded a subsidiary imprint called Valory Music Co. Acts signed to this roster include [[Jimmy Wayne]] (who was formerly signed to Big Machine), [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[The Mavericks]], [[Thomas Rhett]], and [[Justin Moore]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=1073&t=Big_Machine_starts_new_label_signs_Jewel_Jimmy_Wayne_Justin_Moore |title=Big Machine starts new label, signs Jewel, Jimmy Wayne, Justin Moore |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |date=November 2, 2007 |work=Country Standard Time.com| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071111045854/http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=1073&t=Big_Machine_starts_new_label_signs_Jewel_Jimmy_Wayne_Justin_Moore| archive-date= November 11, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

By the end of November 2008, the Valory imprint entered into a partnership with [[Midas Records]]—promotion, sales, marketing, production, publicity and distribution—for Canadian acts [[Adam Gregory]] and [[Emerson Drive]].<ref>{{cite news|title=On Music Row: Valory takes Emerson Drive in tow|url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-business/music-row-valory-takes-emerson-drive-tow|accessdate=January 10, 2015|work=The City Paper|date=September 15, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110102052/http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-business/music-row-valory-takes-emerson-drive-tow|archive-date=January 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The announcement that [[Reba McEntire]] would join Valory was also publicized in November 2008.

===BMLG Records===
Big Machine joined with [[Universal Republic Records]] in June 2009 to found a new label, Republic Nashville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=2955|title=New Nashville label starts with Sunny Sweeney aboard|date=June 5, 2009|work=[[Country Standard Time]]|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}</ref> 
In August 2016, Republic Nashville was rebranded as [[BMLG Records]] after Big Machine took back full ownership of the label.

===Dot Records===
In March 2014, Big Machine announced the revival of [[Dot Records]] and, as of February 2015, the imprint was run in partnership with Republic Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/music/2014/03/24/big-machine-resurrects-dot-records-name/6830685/|title=Big Machine resurrects Dot Records name|last=Rau|first=Nate|date=March 24, 2014|work=[[The Tennessean]]|accessdate=March 27, 2014}}</ref> Dot was shuttered in March 2017 and a number of its artists moved to other Big Machine imprints.

===Nash Icon Records===
In 2014, Big Machine announced a partnership with [[Cumulus Media]] to create Nash Icon Music, a Big Machine imprint serving as an offshoot of Cumulus's [[Nash FM]] brand, focusing on active country acts who achieved mainstream fame in the 1990s and early 2000s. Cumulus also operates Nash Icon-branded radio stations with a similar focus.<ref name="ajc-nash989">{{cite news|title=Oldies 98.9 becomes older-skewing country NASH Icon 98.9|url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2014/08/15/oldies-98-9-becomes-older-skewing-country-nash-icons-98-9/|accessdate=August 16, 2014|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|agency=[[Cox Media Group]]|date=August 15, 2014}}</ref><ref name="ri-nashicons">{{cite web|title=Nash Icons launches across the country|url=http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/netgnomes/89681/cumulus-prepping-nash-icons-format-launch/|website=Radio Insight|accessdate=August 16, 2014|date=August 15, 2014}}</ref>
