'''Mecklenburg-Vorpommern''' ({{IPA-de|ˈmeːklənbʊʁk ˈfoːɐ̯pɔmɐn|lang}}, '''MV'''), also known by its [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] name '''Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania''' or '''Mecklenburg-West Pomerania''', is a [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Germany]].<ref>merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Mecklenburg-West%20Pomerania</ref><ref>britannica.com/place/Mecklenburg-West-Pomerania</ref>  Of the country's sixteen states, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern [[Demographics of Germany#States|ranks]] 14th in population, 6th in area, and 16th in population density. [[Schwerin]] is the state capital and [[Rostock]] is the largest city. Other major [[List of cities in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|cities]] include [[Neubrandenburg]], [[Stralsund]], [[Greifswald]], [[Wismar]] and [[Güstrow]].

The state was established in 1945 after [[World War II]] through the merger of the historic regions of [[Mecklenburg]] and the [[Prussia]]n [[Western Pomerania]] by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet military administration]] in [[Allied-occupied Germany]]. It became part of the [[German Democratic Republic]] in 1949, but was dissolved in 1952 during [[Administrative divisions of East Germany|administrative reforms]] and its territory divided into the districts of [[Bezirk Rostock|Rostock]], [[Bezirk Schwerin|Schwerin]], and [[Bezirk Neubrandenburg|Neubrandenburg]]. A state called in German ''Mecklenburg-Vorpommern'' was re-established in 1990 following [[German reunification]], and became one of the [[New states of Germany|new states]] of the Federal Republic of Germany.

On the state's coastline on the [[Baltic Sea]] are many holiday resorts and much unspoilt nature, including the islands of [[Rügen]], [[Usedom]], and others, as well as the [[Mecklenburg Lake District]], making the state one of [[Tourism in Germany|Germany's leading tourist destinations]].  Three of Germany's fourteen [[national park]]s, as well as several hundred nature [[conservation area]]s, are in the state.  The [[University of Rostock]], founded in 1419, and the [[University of Greifswald]], established in 1456, are among the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest universities]] in Europe. In 2007, the [[33rd G8 summit]] took place at the [[Grand Hotel Heiligendamm]] on the Mecklenburg Baltic coast.

==Name==
Due to its lengthy name, the state is often abbreviated as ''MV'' or (colloquially) shortened to ''MeckPomm''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Steinhauer |first=Anja |date=2014 |title=Duden – Das Wörterbuch der Abkürzungen |location=Mannheim |publisher=Dudenverlag |page=287 |isbn=978-3-411-90269-9}}</ref> In English, it is usually named as "Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania". Inhabitants are called either ''[[Mecklenburg]]er'' or ''[[Western Pomerania|Pomeranians]]'', the combined form is never used.

The full name in German is pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈmeːklənbʊɐ̯k ˈfoɐ̯pɔmɐn|}}. Sometimes, ''Mecklenburg'' is pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈmɛklənbʊɐ̯k|}}. This is because the digraph <ck> marks a preceding short vowel in [[High German]].  Mecklenburg however is within the historical [[Low German]] language area, and the "c" appeared in its name during the period of transition to [[Standard German|Standard]], High German usage (Low German authors wrote the name ''Meklenborg'' or ''Męklenborg'', depicting proper Low German pronunciation, which itself was a [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] of [[Middle Low German]] ''Mekelenborg''). The introduction of the "c" is explained as follows: Either the "c" signals the stretched pronunciation of the preceding "e" ''(Dehnungs-c)'', or it signals the pronunciation of the subsequent "k" as an [[Plosive|occlusive]] [k] to prevent it from falsely being rendered as a [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] [χ] following a Low German trend.<ref>{{citation|title=Der Sprachdienst|volume=34|author=Gesellschaft für Deutsche Sprache|author-link=Gesellschaft für Deutsche Sprache|location=Wiesbaden|year=1990|page=128|language=de}}</ref> Another explanation is that the "c" comes from a [[mannerism]] in High German officialese of writing unnecessary letters, a so-called ''Letternhäufelung'' (lit.: letter accumulation, as was done sometimes in English with words such as "doubt").

==History==

In the aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and [[German reunification]] in 1990, the state was constituted from the historic region of [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Western Pomerania]], both of which had long and rich independent histories.<ref>Michael North, ''Geschichte Mecklenburg-Vorpommerns'' (2008), p. 113</ref>

===Prehistory===

[[File:Putgarten, Kap Arkona (2011-05-21) 3.JPG|thumb|right|Slavic ring fortress at [[Cape Arkona]], [[Rügen|Rügen Island]]]]
Human settlement in the area of modern Mecklenburg and Vorpommern began after the [[Ice Age]], about 10,000 BC. About two thousand years ago, [[Germanic peoples]] were recorded in the area. Most of them left during the [[Migration Period]], heading towards [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and [[France]], leaving the area relatively deserted. In the 6th century [[Polabian Slavs]] populated the area. While Mecklenburg was settled by the [[Obotrites]], while Pomerania was settled by the [[Veleti]] (later ''Liuticians'') and the [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]].<ref name=MN>Michael North, ''The Baltic: A History'' (2015), pp. 187–189</ref>

Along the coast, [[Viking]]s and [[Slavs]] established trade posts like [[Reric]], [[Ralswiek]] and [[Altes Lager Menzlin|Menzlin]]. In the 12th century, Mecklenburg and Vorpommern were conquered by [[Henry the Lion]] and incorporated into the [[Duchy of Saxony]], joining the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the 1180s. Parts of Mecklenburg and Pomerania were settled with [[Germans]] in the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'' process, starting in the 12th century.<ref name=MN/>

===Mecklenburg===
{{Main article|Mecklenburg}}
In the late 12th century, [[Henry the Lion]], Duke of the Saxons, conquered the [[Obotrites]], subjugated its [[House of Mecklenburg|Nikloting]] dynasty, and Christianized its people. In the course of time, German monks, nobility, peasants and traders arrived to settle here. After the 12th century, the territory remained stable and relatively independent of its neighbours; one of the few German territories for which this is true. Mecklenburg first became a [[duchy]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1348. Though later partitioned and re-partitioned within the same dynasty, Mecklenburg always shared a common history and identity. The states of [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] and [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] became [[Grand duchy|Grand Duchies]] in 1815, and in 1870 they voluntarily joined the new [[German Empire]], while retaining their own internal autonomy. After the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[abdication]] of the German [[Kaiser]], the monarchies of the duchies were abolished and republican governments of both Mecklenburg states were established, until the Nazi government merged the two states into a unified {{ill|state of Mecklenburg|de|Land Mecklenburg}}, a virtually meaningless administrative decision under the centralised regime.

===Western Pomerania===
{{Main article|History of Pomerania}}
[[File:Rathaus Stralsund nächtlich erleuchtet.jpg|thumb|left|Late medieval [[Brick Gothic]] architecture in [[Stralsund]], nowadays a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site|World Heritage Site]]]]
[[File:Flag of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (state).svg|thumb|Flag of the State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]]

[[Western Pomerania|Vorpommern]], literally Fore-Pomerania, is the smaller, western part of the former [[Prussia]]n [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]]; the eastern part became part of [[Poland]] after the end of [[World War II]].

In the [[Middle Ages]], the area was ruled by the [[List of Pomeranian duchies and dukes|Pomeranian dukes]] as part of the [[Duchy of Pomerania]]. Pomerania was under [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] rule after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] from 1648 until 1815 as [[Swedish Pomerania]]. Pomerania became a province of Prussia in 1815 and remained so until 1945.

===Mecklenburg-Vorpommern===
====Wartime====
In May 1945, the armies of the [[Soviet Union]] and the Western allies met east of [[Schwerin]]. Following the [[Potsdam Agreement]], the Western allies handed over [[Mecklenburg]] to the Soviets. Mecklenburg-West Pomerania was established on 9 July 1945, by order No. 5 of [[Red Army]] Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]], head of the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]] (SMAD), as the ''Province of Mecklenburg and West Pomerania (zapadnoi Pomeranii)''.<ref>Brunner, Detlev, ''Inventar der Befehle der Sowjetischen Militäradministration Mecklenburg (-Vorpommern) 1945−1949'' in ''Texte und Materialien zur Zeitgeschichte 12'', 2003, {{ISBN|3-598-11621-7}}</ref>

[[File:Pomeraniamap.png|thumb|Division of Pomerania]]
During the war, the make-up of Mecklenburg and Vorpommern's population changed, due to wartime losses and the influx of evacuees (mainly from the Berlin and Hamburg metropolitan areas that were subject to air raids). After the war, people who [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|fled and were expelled from]] the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] settled in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (and elsewhere in Germany), increasing the population by 40%. Before the war, [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Western Pomerania]] had a population of 1,278,700, of whom many perished during the war and others moved west in the course of the Red Army's advance. In 1947, some 1,426,000 refugees from the former eastern parts of Germany were counted. Most of them settled in rural communities, but the urban population also increased, most notably in [[Schwerin]] from 65,000 (1939) to 99,518 (January 1947), in [[Wismar]] from 29,463 to 44,173, and in [[Greifswald]] from 29,488 to 43,897.<ref>Beatrice Vierneisel, ''Fremde im Land: Aspekte zur kulturellen Integration von Umsiedlern in Mecklenburg und Vorpommern 1945 bis 1953'', 2006, p.12, {{ISBN|3-8309-1762-7}}, {{ISBN|978-3-8309-1762-5}}</ref> Western Pomerania was additionally stripped of [[Police County|the area]] around the Pomeranian regional capital Stettin/Szczecin as well as the city itself, despite it was located to the west of the river Oder.

====German Democratic Republic====
[[File:Hanse sail 2010 rostock hafen.jpg|thumb|[[Rostock]] was the major overseas port of [[East Germany]], and is one of the most important [[Baltic Sea]] ports today. Pictured is [[Hanse Sail]], one of the world's largest maritime events.]]
On 5 June 1946, a law enacted by the Soviets constituted a provisional German administration (''Beratende Versammlung'', {{lang-en|"Consulting assembly"}}) under Soviet supervision on 29 June 1946. After elections on 20 October 1946, a ''[[Landtag]]'' replaced the ''Beratende Versammlung'' and created the constitution of 16 January 1947, for the ''[[States of Germany|Land]] Mecklenburg-Vorpommern''. On 18 April 1947, the state's name was shortened to ''Land Mecklenburg''. Mecklenburg became a constituent state ("''Land''") of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) upon its formation in 1949. In 1952, the East German government abandoned the term ''Land'' in this context and redesignated its administrative territorial divisions as "districts" (German: ''[[Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic#Division into Bezirke#Division into Bezirke|Bezirke]]''). The territory of Mecklenburg and Vorpommern was divided into three districts that covered roughly the same area: ''[[Rostock (Bezirk)|Bezirk Rostock]]'', ''[[Schwerin (Bezirk)|Bezirk Schwerin]]'' and ''[[Neubrandenburg (Bezirk)|Bezirk Neubrandenburg]]''. These were commonly known as the ''Nordbezirke'' (northern districts) under the highly centralised GDR government. The East German government developed the [[shipyard]]s in the old [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] ports (the largest being in [[Rostock]] and [[Stralsund]]), and also established the [[Greifswald Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Lubmin]] near [[Greifswald]].

====Reunification====
At the time of [[German reunification]] in 1990, the eastern states were reconstituted along their postwar boundaries (with minor adjustments) as they had existed until 1952, and the historic name Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was restored. Since 1990, the state has undergone dramatic changes. What had been largely an industrial and agricultural economy is increasingly driven by the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service]], [[Tourism in Germany|tourism]], and [[High tech|high-tech]] sectors. The [[List of cities in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|old towns]], [[List of castles and palaces in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|hundreds of castles and manors]], [[Resort architecture|resort buildings]], [[List of windmills in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|windmills]], churches, and various other cultural monuments of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern have been renovated in recent years. Since 2013, net migration into the state has been positive again.

===Location and urban areas===
{{See also|List of cities in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|List of cities in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern by population}}
Sixth-largest in area and fourteenth in overall population among Germany's sixteen [[States of Germany|Bundesländer]] (federal states), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is bounded to the north by the [[Baltic Sea]], to the west by [[Schleswig-Holstein]], to the southwest by [[Lower Saxony]], to the south by [[Brandenburg]], and to the east by the [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship]] in [[Poland]].

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's state capital is [[Schwerin]]. The largest city is [[Rostock]] with approximately 205,000 people, followed by [[Schwerin]]. Other major cities include [[Neubrandenburg]], [[Stralsund]], [[Greifswald]], [[Wismar]] and [[Güstrow]].

===Districts===
[[File:Schwerin Schweriner Schloss Kasteel van Schwerin Palace Castle Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Duitsland Germany.jpg|thumb|[[Schwerin]], the state capital of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]

Since 4 September 2011, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is divided into six ''Kreise'' (districts):

# [[Rostock (district)|Landkreis Rostock]]
# [[Ludwigslust-Parchim]]
# [[Mecklenburgische Seenplatte (district)|Mecklenburgische Seenplatte]]
# [[Nordwestmecklenburg]]
# [[Vorpommern-Greifswald]]
# [[Vorpommern-Rügen]]
Also counting two independent urban districts:
# [[Rostock]] (HRO)
# [[Schwerin]] (SN)

===Landscape===
The state's [[Baltic Sea]] coast is about 2,000&nbsp;km long and features several islands, most notably Germany's two biggest islands [[Rügen]] and [[Usedom]], but also a number of smaller islands such as [[Hiddensee]] and [[Poel]]. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's varied coastline also has many peninsulas such as [[Fischland-Darß-Zingst]] and various [[lagoons]] (also known as ''Bodden'' or ''Haff'').

A total of 283 nature reserves, 110 landscape reserves and three of Germany's fourteen [[List of national parks of Germany|national parks]] are scattered all over the state.

====Lakes====
{{see also|List of lakes in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern}}
The southern part of the state is characterized by a multitude of lakes within the [[Mecklenburg Lake District|Mecklenburg Lakeland]], the largest of which is Lake [[Müritz]] (also the largest [[List of lakes of Germany|German lake]]), followed by [[Lake Schwerin]], [[Plauer See (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern)|Plauer See]] and [[Lake Kummerow]]. The "land of a thousand lakes" (German: ''Land der tausend Seen'') is hallmarked by its unspoilt nature. Due to its clean air and idyllic setting, [[medical tourism]] has become a notable tourism sector in the region.<ref name=Welt>{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/die-welt/article3690141/Branche-mit-Zukunft.html|title= Branche mit Zukunft|date=2009-05-07|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=2009-05-08|language=de}}</ref>

==Culture==
Over the centuries, Mecklenburg and Vorpommern have developed and maintained strong regional cultures. It can generally be described as [[Northern Germany|North German]] and has similar linguistic and historic characteristics to other north German states, such as [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. People in Vorpommern, as a result of that territory being a former province of [[Prussia]], tend to look slightly more towards [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]] than people in Mecklenburg would.

===Architecture===
The cities are characterised by a certain "[[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]]" style also found in other parts of northern Germany (e.g. [[Lübeck]]) as well as in countries bordering the [[Baltic Sea]] like [[Estonia]] (e.g. [[Tallinn]]) or [[Latvia]] (e.g. [[Riga]]). A common feature of many towns in Mecklenburg and Vorpommern are red [[Brick Gothic]] churches and houses dating back to the [[Middle Ages]]. Also [[Crow-stepped gable|stepped]] and [[Dutch gable|tailed gables]] are a typical feature of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] old towns, such as [[Stralsund]], [[Wismar]] and [[Greifswald]].

The old towns are usually built around one or several market places with a church or the town hall. Often towns were founded at the [[Baltic Sea]], one of the many [[Mecklenburg Lake District|lakes]] or a river for logistical and trade motives.

Rural areas of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are often characterized by Brick Gothic village [[:Category:Churches in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|churches]] and [[agricultural]] heritage, like brick [[Farmhouse|homestead]]s, [[thatched roof]] houses, [[List of windmills in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|windmills]], [[List of castles and palaces in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|manor houses and castles]].

===Museums, art and theatres===

The largest publicly funded theatres in the state are the [[Mecklenburg State Theatre]], the [[Rostock People's Theatre]], the [[Theatre of West Pomerania]], with venues in [[Stralsund]], [[Putbus]] and [[Greifswald]], and the Mecklenburg State Theatre of Neustrelitz with venues in [[Neubrandenburg]] and [[Neustrelitz]]. All four theatres offer both drama and musical theatre as well as orchestral music.
Other important theatres are the Ernst Barlach Theatre of [[Güstrow]], the Theatre of [[Parchim]], the [[Anklam]] Theatre and the [[Wismar Theatre]].
There are also many small theatres on the Baltic coast and in individual artist's villages and resorts (e.g. the popular concert pavilions at the [[Baltic Sea]]). Since its growing importance for summer tourism, [[open-air theatre]]s and festivals become more common again as well, such as the [[Störtebeker Festival]] on the island of [[Rügen]], and the ''Vineta Festival'' on [[Usedom]].

Since 1993, the [[Störtebeker Festival]] has taken place in [[Ralswiek]] on the island of Rügen. It is Germany's most successful open-air theatre.

Notable museums include, for example, the [[Staatliches Museum Schwerin|Schwerin State Museum]] and the [[Pomeranian State Museum]] at Greifswald. The [[German Oceanographic Museum]] with its [[Ozeaneum]] in Stralsund is the most popular museum in northern Germany. Furthermore, the [[German Amber Museum]] in [[Ribnitz-Damgarten]], Rostock's [[Abbey of the Holy Cross, Rostock|Abbey of the Holy Cross]] and [[Rostock Art Gallery]] are of national importance. The oldest museum in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is Stralsund's [[Museum of Cultural History, Stralsund|Cultural History Museum]], the smallest is the [[Wilhelm Wandschneider|Professor Wandschneider Sculpture Museum]] in Plau am See.

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is home to many cultural events throughout the year. During summer, many open-air concerts and operas are open to visitors. The Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Festival (''Festspiele Mecklenburg-Vorpommern'') attracts a sizeable audience by performing classical concerts in parks, churches and castles.

[[Caspar David Friedrich]], a famous [[romanticism|romanticist]] [[Painting|painter]] born in [[Greifswald]], immortalised parts of the state in several of his paintings.

===Language===
[[File:Low Saxon Dialects.svg|thumb|upright|Low German dialects]]
Today the vast majority of people speak [[Standard German]]; a few centuries ago most people spoke [[Low German]] (German: ''Plattdeutsch'' or ''Niederdeutsch''), a language that is still kept alive within various communities and cultural events.

===Food and drinks===
{{See also|Pomeranian cuisine}}
Like most German regions, Mecklenburg and Vorpommern have their own traditional dishes, often including fish, beef and pork. Rostock has its own type of [[bratwurst]] called ''Rostocker Bratwurst''. A famous dish from [[Western Pomerania]] is [[Pickled herring|Bismarck Herring]]. [[Rødgrød|Rote Grütze]] is a popular dessert. The largest [[German beer|beer]] breweries are ''[[Holsten Brewery|Mecklenburgische Brauerei Lübz]]'' ([[Lübz]]er Pils), ''Hanseatische Brauerei [[Rostock]]'', ''[[Dargun]]er Brauerei'' and ''Störtebeker Braumanufaktur'' ([[Stralsund]], multiple winner of the [[World Beer Cup]]). Besides, there are many smaller breweries and [[craft beer]] variations, such as the ''[[Mellenthin]] Castle Beer'' from [[Usedom]] Island.

As of 2018, the majority (81.8%) of the citizens of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are not religious or adhere to other religions. 14.8% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] and 3.4% of the [[Catholic Church]].<ref>[https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Ber_Kirchenmitglieder_2018.pdf Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland – Kirchemitgliederzahlen Stand 31. Dezember 2018] EKD, January 2020</ref>

Following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], led in Germany by [[Martin Luther]], as well as a period of [[Sweden|Swedish]] rule, the traditional faith in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is [[Protestantism]], specifically [[Lutheranism]]. There are also a number of [[Catholic]]s and people of other faiths.

In May 2012 the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg]] merged with [[North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church]] and [[Pomeranian Evangelical Church]] into the new [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany]].<ref>[http://www.nordkirche.de/ Nordkirche.de] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140512101634/http://www.nordkirche.de/ |date=2014-05-12 }} {{in lang|de}}</ref>
Some parishes of the state belong to [[Evangelical Church Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia|Evangelical Church of Berlin and Brandenburg]].

There are also [[Judaism|Jewish]] communities, in the state capital of [[Schwerin]] (including [[Wismar]]) and in the city of [[Rostock]]. Historically, there were also synagogues in smaller towns, of which some are still preserved (like [[Röbel]], [[Krakow am See]] and [[Boizenburg]]). The state's Jewish organisation is part of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]].

===The labour market===
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is the least densely populated and least industrial [[States of Germany|German state]], being the sixth largest in area, but only the 14th in population. Formerly, unemployment has been negatively affected by the breakdown of non-competitive former [[GDR]] industries after the [[German reunification]] in the 1990s.  As of 2018 unemployment is the lowest in more than 15 years while the economy is growing and the number of jobs is increasing continually. Growing sectors are [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]], [[life sciences]], [[maritime industry]] and [[Tourism in Germany|tourist]] services.

In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, approximately 732,200 people were gainfully employed in 2008 with 657,100 of them were white and blue collar workers. About 4,200 new jobs were created in 2007. Employees worked an average of 1,455 hours a year. The number of self-employed did not change in 2008. Three out of every four of all workers are employed in the service sector.<ref name="Employment and Labour Market">{{cite web|title=Employment and Labour Market|url=http://www.mecklenburg-vorpommern.eu/cms2/Landesportal_prod/Landesportal/content/en/State_and_Government/Our_State/Facts_and_Figures/Employment_and_Labour_Market/index.jsp|publisher=Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|accessdate=March 30, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307023704/http://www.mecklenburg-vorpommern.eu/cms2/Landesportal_prod/Landesportal/content/en/State_and_Government/Our_State/Facts_and_Figures/Employment_and_Labour_Market/index.jsp|archive-date=March 7, 2011}}</ref> In October 2018 the unemployment rate stood at 7.1% and was the third highest rate in Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/36651/umfrage/arbeitslosenquote-in-deutschland-nach-bundeslaendern/|title=Arbeitslosenquote nach Bundesländern in Deutschland 2018 {{!}} Statista|website=Statista|language=de|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref>
