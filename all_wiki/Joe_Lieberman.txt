'''Joseph Isadore Lieberman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|b|ər|m|ən}}; born February 24, 1942) is an American politician, lobbyist and attorney who served as a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Connecticut]] from 1989 to 2013. A former member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was its nominee for [[Vice President of the United States]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election]]. During his final term in office he was officially listed as an [[independent Democrat]] and caucused with and chaired committees for the Democratic Party.

Lieberman was elected as a "[[Reform Democrat]]" in 1970 to the [[Connecticut Senate]], where he served three terms as Majority Leader. After an unsuccessful bid for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1980, he served as [[Connecticut Attorney General|state Attorney General]] from 1983 to 1989. He narrowly defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.|Lowell Weicker]] in [[1988 United States Senate election in Connecticut|1988]] to win election to the U.S. Senate, and was re-elected in [[1994 United States Senate election in Connecticut|1994]], [[2000 United States Senate election in Connecticut|2000]], and [[2006 United States Senate election in Connecticut|2006]]. He was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee for Vice President in the [[2000 United States presidential election]], running with [[President of the United States|presidential]] nominee and then Vice President [[Al Gore]], and becoming the first Jewish candidate on a [[major party|major]] American political party presidential ticket.<ref name="EDAH">{{cite web |url=http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/document.cfm?title=The%20Lieberman%20Phenomenon&hyperlink=The_Lieberman_Phenomenon.html&type=JournalArticle&category=Orthodoxy%20and%20Modernity&authortitle=Dr.&firstname=Samuel&lastname=Heilman&pubsource=The%20Edah%20Journal%20Volume%201%3A1&authorid=278&pdfattachment=heilman.pdf |title=The Lieberman Phenomenon |work=Dr. Samuel Heilman&nbsp;– The Edah Journal Volume 1:1 |access-date=December 31, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washtimes.com/elections/candidate/336/ |title=Joseph Lieberman |work=Washington Times |access-date=September 3, 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In the 2000 presidential election, Gore and Lieberman won the [[Direct election|popular vote]] by a margin of more than 500,000 votes, but lost the deciding [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] to the Republican [[George W. Bush]]/[[Dick Cheney]] ticket 271–266. He also unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]].

During his Senate re-election bid in [[2006 United States Senate election in Connecticut|2006]], Lieberman lost the Democratic Party primary election, but won re-election in the general election as a [[Third party (politics)|third party]] candidate under the "[[Connecticut for Lieberman]]" party label.

A spokesperson told ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'' in 1994 that Lieberman received an educational deferment from the [[Vietnam War]] [[conscription|draft]] when he was an undergraduate and law student from 1960 to 1967. Upon graduating from law school at age 25, Lieberman qualified for a family deferment because he was already married and had a child.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010424162510/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/democracy/gore/stories/lieberman/ Lieberman: A history-making candidate.] CNN.com.

==Personal life==
Lieberman met his first wife, Betty Haas, at the congressional office of Senator [[Abraham Ribicoff]] (D-CT), where they worked as summer student interns. They married in 1965 while Joe Lieberman was in law school. They have two children&nbsp;– Matt and Rebecca. Betty, who is also Jewish, later worked as a psychiatric [[social work]]er. In 1981, the couple divorced. When asked about the divorce in an interview with ''[[New York Magazine]]'', Lieberman said, "one of the differences we had was in levels of religious observance", adding, "I'm convinced if that was the only difference, we wouldn't have gotten divorced."<ref name=GoJoe>[http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/politics/n_7996/index1.html You Go, Joe.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050318215339/http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/politics/n_7996/index1.html |date=March 18, 2005 }} ''[[New York Magazine]]'' November 18, 2002.</ref>

[[File:Joe Lieberman Marty Markowitz BBF 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|left|Lieberman with [[Marty Markowitz]] at the 2011 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]] to discuss the role spirituality played in his life.]] Lieberman describes himself as an "observant" Jew.<ref name="EDAH"/> In 1965 he married Betty Haas, a [[Reform Jew]]. Since the death in 1967 of his grandmother, a deeply religious immigrant, he found renewed interest in religious observance. His second wife, Hadassah, is also an observant [[Modern Orthodox Jew]]. "Hadassah calls herself my right wing", says Lieberman.<ref name=GoJoe/> In Lieberman's 1988 upset of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] incumbent Senator [[Lowell Weicker]], Lieberman's religious observance was mostly viewed in terms of refusal to campaign on the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]. This changed when Al Gore chose Lieberman as the running mate; a Lieberman press officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said:

Lieberman was elected as a "reform Democrat" to the [[Connecticut Senate]] in 1970, where he served for 10 years, including the last six as Majority Leader. He suffered his first defeat in Connecticut elections in the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] landslide year of 1980, losing the race for the Third District Congressional seat to Republican [[Lawrence Joseph DeNardis]], a state senator from suburban [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden]] with whom he had worked closely on bipartisan legislative efforts.

===Tenure===
Lieberman was first elected to the [[United States Senate]] as a Democrat in the [[United States Senate election, 1988|1988 election]], defeating liberal Republican [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.|Lowell Weicker]]  by a margin of 10,000 votes. He scored the nation's biggest political upset that year, after being backed by a coalition of Democrats and unaffiliated voters with support from conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] (most notably including ''[[National Review]]'' founder and ''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]'' host [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] and his brother, former [[New York (state)|New York]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[James L.

During the campaign, he received support from Connecticut's [[Cuban Americans|Cuban American]] community which was unhappy with Weicker. Lieberman has since remained firmly anti-Castro.<ref name=Toobin>Toobin, Jeffrey.

Shortly after his first election to the Senate, Lieberman was approached by incoming [[Majority leader|Majority Leader]] [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]] who advised him, "Pick out two or three areas that you're really interested in and learn them so that your colleagues know what you're talking about (...) You're going to have more influence even as a freshman than you think because you know there's hundreds of issues and inevitably we rely on each other."<ref name="conversationswithbillkristol.org">{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/joe-lieberman/|title=Joe Lieberman on Conversations with Bill Kristol}}</ref> Recalling the conversation, Lieberman has said, "that was true when I first came in, although you could see partisanship beginning to eat away at that. But at the end of my 24 years, it was really so partisan that it was hard to make the combinations to get to 60 votes to break a filibuster to get things done."<ref name="conversationswithbillkristol.org"/>

Lieberman's initiatives against violence in [[video game]]s are considered the chief impetus behind the establishment of an industry-wide [[video game rating system]] during the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite journal|title=75 Power Players: The Watcher|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=67}}</ref>

In 1994, Lieberman made history by winning by the largest landslide ever in a Connecticut Senate race, drawing 67 percent of the vote and beating his opponent by more than 350,000 votes.
Like [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Dick Gephardt]], Lieberman served as chair of the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] from 1995–2001. In 1998, Lieberman was the first prominent Democrat to publicly challenge Clinton for the judgment exercised in his [[Lewinsky scandal|affair]] with [[Monica Lewinsky]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030920201157/http://www.australianpolitics.com/usa/clinton/impeachment/lieberman.shtml Senator Joe Lieberman Attacks Clinton.] AustralianPolitics.com September 3, 1998. Retrieved October 10, 2006.</ref>  However, he voted against removing Clinton from office by impeachment.

Of his criticism of [[Bill Clinton]], Lieberman said in 2014:

<blockquote>It was a very hard thing for me to do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn't say something, I'd be a hypocrite. I also felt that if somebody who was supportive of him didn't say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from [[Erskine Bowles]] who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying that he was going to express an opinion which wasn't universally held at the White House&nbsp;– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it's the White House. And it's now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, "I just want you to know that there's nothing you said in that speech that I don't agree with. And I want you to know that I'm working on it." And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.<ref name="conversationswithbillkristol.org"/></blockquote>

In spring 2000, Lieberman among other centrist Democrats founded the Senate [[New Democrat Coalition]]. In the same year, while concurrently running for the vice presidency, Lieberman was [[United States Senate election, 2000|elected]] to a third Senate term with 64 percent of the vote easily defeating the Republican [[Philip Giordano]].

Lieberman sought the Democratic Party's renomination for U.S. Senate from Connecticut in 2006 but lost to the comparatively more liberal [[Ned Lamont]], a [[Greenwich]] businessman and antiwar candidate.

Lieberman was officially endorsed by the Connecticut Democratic Convention, which met in May. However, Lamont received 33 percent of the delegates' votes, forcing an August primary.

In July, Lieberman announced that he would file papers to appear on the November ballot should he lose the primary, stating, "I'm a loyal Democrat, but I have loyalties that are greater than those to my party, and that's my loyalty to my state and my country."<ref>Klein, Rick.

On August 8, 2006, Lieberman [[Concession (politics)|conceded]] the [[Democratic party (United States)|Democratic]] primary election to Ned Lamont, saying, "For the sake of our state, our country and my party, I cannot and will not let that result stand," and announced he would run in the [[United States Senate election in Connecticut, 2006|2006 November election]] as an independent candidate on the [[Connecticut for Lieberman]] ticket, against both Lamont and the Republican candidate, [[Alan Schlesinger]].<ref>Barry, Ellen.

Lamont noted Lieberman's position was similar to [[George W. Bush]] and [[Dick Cheney]]'s position. Lamont said, "That comment sounds an awful lot like Vice President Cheney's comment on Wednesday. Both of them believe our invasion of Iraq has a lot to do with 9/11. That's a false premise."<ref name=Offensive/> Lieberman's communications director replied that Lamont was politicizing national security by "portraying [Lieberman] as a soul mate of President Bush on Iraq".<ref name=Offensive/>

As a moderate Democrat, Lieberman earned an inordinate amount of support from some prominent conservatives in American politics. On August 17, 2006 the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] stated that they would favor a Lieberman victory in the November election over Democratic nominee Ned Lamont. The NRSC did state, however, that they were not going so far as to actually support Lieberman.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060916143703/http://thepoliticker.observer.com/2006/08/nrsc-takes-lieberman.html NRSC Takes Lieberman.].

===Creation of Department of Homeland Security (DHS)===
[[File:U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman and Ranking Member Susan Collins address bipartisan suggestion on countermeasures toward domestic terrorism.jpg|thumb|[[Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee]] Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member [[Susan Collins]] address bipartisan suggestion on countermeasures toward [[Jihadist extremism in the United States|Islamist extremism]] & [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|domestic terrorism in U.S.]]]]
When control of the Senate switched from Republicans to Democrats in June 2001, Lieberman became Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee]], with oversight responsibilities for a broad range of government activities. He was also a member of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Environment and Public Works Committee]] and chair of its [[United States Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety|Subcommittee Clean Air, Wetlands and Private Property]]; the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]], where he chaired the [[United States Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Airland|Airland Subcommittee]] and sat on the [[United States Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities|Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities]]; and the [[United States Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship|Small Business Committee]]. When Republicans gained control of the Senate in January 2003, Lieberman resumed his role as ranking minority member of the committees he had once chaired.<ref>[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040401000639/http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_congressional_directory&docid=cdir108_txt-62.pdf Standing Committees of the Senate 108th Congress]. Retrieved September 10, 2006.</ref>

In 2002, as Chairman of what was then known as the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Lieberman led the fight to create a new [[Department of Homeland Security]]. One month after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, he introduced legislation to reorganize the federal government to better protect the American people from terrorism and natural disasters and steered a bipartisan plan through his committee. After months of opposing the plan, the White House eventually endorsed the concept. Legislation that passed Congress in 2002 created a department incorporating key organizational elements Senator Lieberman advocated.<ref name="lieberman.senate.gov">{{cite web |url=http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/issues-legislation/homeland-security-and-governmental-affairs |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524162511/http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/issues-legislation/homeland-security-and-governmental-affairs |archive-date=May 24, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2006, Senators Lieberman and [[Susan Collins|Collins]] drafted legislation to reshape the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] into an agency that would more effectively prepare for and respond to catastrophes, including natural disasters and terrorist attacks. The legislation elevated FEMA to special status within the Department of Homeland Security, much like the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] and designated the head of FEMA to be the President's point person during an emergency. The bill also called for the reunification of the preparedness and response functions within FEMA, giving it responsibility for all phases of emergency management. And the measure strengthened FEMA's regional offices, creating dedicated interagency "strike teams" to provide the initial federal response to a disaster in the region. The legislation passed Congress in September 2006. As the 2007 hurricane season approached, Lieberman held an oversight hearing on implementation of the FEMA reforms on May 22, 2007. He urged FEMA to implement the reforms at a quicker pace.<ref name="lieberman.senate.gov"/>

Lieberman actively oversaw the government response to the [[H1N1 influenza]] (swine flu) pandemic and held four hearings on the subject in 2009, including one in Connecticut. He has continually pressed the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] to distribute [[vaccine]]s and antiviral medications at a quicker pace and to streamline the process.<ref name="lieberman.senate.gov"/>

In the 110th Congress, Lieberman was Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is responsible for assuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government. In addition, he was a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee; Senate Armed Services Committee, where he was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Air Land Forces and sat on the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities; and the Small Business Committee.

===Fundraising===
Since 1989, Lieberman has received more than $31.4&nbsp;million in campaign donations from specific industries and sectors. His largest donors have represented the securities and investment ($3.7&nbsp;million), legal ($3.6&nbsp;million), real estate ($3.1&nbsp;million) and health professional ($1.1&nbsp;million) industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&cid=N00000616&type=I |title=Center for Responsive Politics profile |publisher=Opensecrets.org |date=May 16, 2010 |access-date=May 24, 2010}}</ref>

In 2015, Lieberman served as Co-chair of the [[Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense]], a commission that recommended changes to U.S. policy regarding biodefense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biodefensestudy.org/|title=Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense|website=www.biodefensestudy.org|access-date=2017-01-20}}</ref> In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Joe Lieberman headed the organization with former Governor Tom Ridge, and the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, ''The National Blueprint for Biodefense'', proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues.

One report on Lieberman's involvement was critical of him for failing to disclose in his testimony the extensive legal work his Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman law firm had done for Donald Trump since at least as long ago as 2001.

On July 17, 2018, Lieberman published an opinion piece in [[The Wall Street Journal]] imploring people to vote for [[Joe Crowley]], who was defeated in the Democratic primary by [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]].

Lieberman has continued to remain critical of Ocasio-Cortez, stating that “With all respect, I certainly hope she’s not the future, and I don’t believe she is.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/424879-ocasio-cortez-responds-to-joe-liebermans-criticisms-new-party-who-dis|title=Ocasio-Cortez responds to Joe Lieberman's criticisms: 'New party, who dis?'|first=Morgan|last=Gstalter|date=January 11, 2019|website=TheHill}}</ref>

The Gore/Lieberman ticket won a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the [[Direct election|popular vote]], with over half a million more votes than the Republican ticket of [[George W. Bush]] and [[Dick Cheney]], but they were defeated in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] by a vote of 271 to 266 after an intense legal battle concerning the outcome in disputed counties (see ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''). The US Supreme Court ruled that the Florida Supreme Court's ordered recount was unconstitutional and said that it defers to what it believes is the Florida Supreme Court's judgment that December 12 is the deadline for all recounts--thus preventing a new recount from being ordered.

Like Democratic VP candidates [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1960, [[Lloyd Bentsen]] in 1988, [[John Edwards]] in 2004, and [[Joe Biden]] in 2008, Lieberman's Senate term was due to expire during the election cycle. He decided to run for re-election to maintain his seat, as Johnson, Bentsen and Biden did. Three won re-election to the Senate, but Johnson and Biden then gave up their Senate seats because they were also elected Vice President. Edwards did not simultaneously run for re-election to the Senate.

On January 13, 2003, Lieberman announced his intention to seek the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|Democratic nomination]] as a candidate in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]].

Describing his Presidential hopes, Lieberman opined that his historically [[hawkish]] stance would appeal to voters. Indeed, he initially led in polls of primaries, but due to his political positions he failed to win a support of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] Democratic voters, who dominated the primaries.<ref>{{cite web|author=JOHN E.

Prior to his defeat in [[New Hampshire]], Lieberman declared that his campaign was picking up "Joementum"; however, he failed to provide such momentum during the [[New Hampshire primary]] debates, held at [[Saint Anselm College]] days before the primary.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/25/elec04.prez.lieberman/ Lieberman says he's got the 'Joementum'] CNN.com January 26, 2004. Retrieved March 6, 2007.</ref> On February 3, 2004, Lieberman withdrew his candidacy after failing to win any of the five primaries or two caucuses held that day. He acknowledged to the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' that his support for the war in Iraq was a large part of his undoing with voters.<ref>Hamilton, Elizabeth. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7604812_ITM Lieberman Reflects on Candidacy.] ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'' April 15, 2004.</ref>

Lieberman's former running candidate Al Gore did not support Lieberman's Presidential run, and in December 2003 endorsed [[Howard Dean]]'s candidacy, saying "This is about all of us and all of us need to get behind the strongest candidate [Dean]."<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0312/09/se.01.html Gore Endorses Dean: CNN LIVE EVENT/SPECIAL transcript.] CNN.com December 9, 2003. Retrieved October 10, 2006.</ref>

Finally Lieberman withdrew from the race without winning a single contest. In total popular vote he placed 7th behind the eventual nominee, [[Massachusetts]] senator [[John Kerry]]; the eventual vice presidential nominee, [[North Carolina]] Senator [[John Edwards]]; former [[Governor of Vermont]] [[Howard Dean]]; [[Ohio]] [[US House|Representative]] [[Dennis Kucinich]]; retired General [[Wesley Clark]]; and Reverend [[Al Sharpton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1689 |title=US President&nbsp;– D Primaries Race&nbsp;– Jan&nbsp;13, 2004 |publisher=Our Campaigns |access-date=May 24, 2010}}</ref>

On June 5, Lieberman launched "Citizens for McCain," hosted on the McCain campaign website, to recruit Democratic support for John McCain's candidacy.

Some members of the Democratic caucus were reportedly angry at the decision not to punish Lieberman more severely.

Lieberman's embrace of certain conservative policies and in particular his endorsement of John McCain have been cited as factors for his high approval rating among Republicans in Connecticut with 66% of Republicans approving of him along with 52% of independents also approving of his job performance, this however is also cited for his mediocre approval rating among Democrats: 44% approving and 46% disapproving.<ref name="hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com">{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Sean|title=Lieberman Praising Connecticut Republicans|url=http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/10/lieberman-prais.php|access-date=May 18, 2017|work=National Journal|date=October 24, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025070740/http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/10/lieberman-prais.php|archive-date=October 25, 2011}}</ref>

Lieberman has been a major opponent of the [[whistle-blowing]] website [[WikiLeaks]].

Journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] called Lieberman's actions "one of the most pernicious acts by a U.S. Senator in quite some time," and accused Lieberman of "emulat[ing] Chinese dictators" by "abusing his position as [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Homeland Security]] Chairman to thuggishly dictate to private companies which websites they should and should not host&nbsp;– and, more important, what you can and cannot read on the Internet."<ref>[[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]] (December 2, 2010) [https://web.archive.org/web/20101203184232/http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/12/01/lieberman/index.html Joe Lieberman emulates Chinese dictators], ''[[Salon.com]]''</ref> Lieberman has also suggested that "the ''[[New York Times]]'' and other news organisations publishing the US embassy cables being released by WikiLeaks could be investigated for breaking [[Espionage Act of 1917|US espionage laws]]."<ref>Owen, Paul; Adams, Richard; and McAskill, Ewen (December 7, 2010) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/07/wikileaks-joe-lieberman-new-york-times-investigated WikiLeaks: US Senator Joe Lieberman suggests New York Times could be investigated], ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

Along with Senators [[John Ensign]] and [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]], Lieberman "introduced a bill to amend the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] in order to facilitate the prosecution of folks like Wikileaks."<ref name=Wittes>[[Benjamin Wittes|Wittes, Benjamin]] (December 6, 2010) [http://www.lawfareblog.com/2010/12/espionage-act-amendments/ Espionage Act Amendments], ''Lawfare''</ref> Critics have noted that "[l]eaking [classified] information in the first place is already a crime, so the measure is aimed squarely at publishers," and that "Lieberman's proposed solution to WikiLeaks could have implications for journalists reporting on some of the more unsavory practices of the intelligence community."<ref name=Wired>[[Kevin Poulsen|Poulsen, Kevin]] (December 2, 2010) [https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/shield Lieberman Introduces Anti-WikiLeaks Legislation], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''</ref> Legal analyst [[Benjamin Wittes]] has called the proposed legislation "the worst of both worlds," saying:

{{quote|It leaves intact the current World War I-era Espionage Act provision, 18 U.S.C. 793(e), a law [with] many problems ... and then takes a currently well-drawn law and expands its scope to the point that it covers a lot more than the most reckless of media excesses. A lot of good journalism would be a crime under this provision; after all, knowingly and willfully publishing material 'concerning the human intelligence activities of the United States or any foreign government' is no small part of what a good newspaper does.<ref name=Wittes/>}}

As a result of these statements and actions, Lieberman has been perceived as an opponent of Internet [[free speech]] and become the target of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] attacks under [[Operation Payback]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}

Lieberman is a supporter of [[abortion rights]] and of the [[LGBT rights|rights of gays and lesbians]] to [[LGBT adoption in the United States|adopt children]], to be protected with [[Hate crime laws|hate crime legislation]], and to [[DADT|serve openly]] in the military.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ontheissues.org/2008/Joseph_Lieberman_Civil_Rights.htm |title=Joseph Lieberman on Civil Rights |publisher=Ontheissues.org |access-date=May 24, 2010}}</ref> Lieberman was one of the Senate's leading opponents of violence in video games and on television.

Lieberman is known for his leadership in the successful effort to repeal the [[Don't ask, don't tell]] policy regarding sexual orientation in the U.S. Armed Forces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Lieberman-takes-up-liberal-mantle-on-Don-t-Ask-868430.php|title=Lieberman takes up liberal mantle on Don't Ask Don't Tell|first1=Magdalene|last1=Perez|first2=Staff|last2=Writer|date=December 8, 2010|website=StamfordAdvocate}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/42301.html|title=Lieberman airs 'don't ask' doubts|first=Josh|last=Gerstein|website=POLITICO}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2010/12/22/132255647/saving-dont-ask-dont-tell-took-wily-band-of-lawmakers|title=Saving 'Don't Ask' Repeal Took Wily Band Of Lawmakers|website=NPR.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/us/23military.html|title=Obama Ends 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Policy|first=Elisabeth|last=Bumiller|date=July 22, 2011|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

During debate on the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], Lieberman opposed the public option.  As the crucial 60th vote needed to pass the legislation, his opposition to the public option was critical for its removal from the resulting bill.<ref name="auto"/>

Lieberman was an integral part in attempting to stop [[WikiLeaks]] from publishing further material using U.S.-based corporations in the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] of 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2010/dec/03/wikileaks-tableau-visualisation-joe-lieberman |title=WikiLeaks cables visualisation pulled after pressure from Joe Lieberman |work=Guardian | date=December 3, 2010 | access-date=December 3, 2010 |location=London |first=Charles |last=Arthur}}</ref>

In June 2015, Lieberman was a signatory to a public letter written by a bipartisan group of 19 U.S. diplomats, experts, and others, on the then-pending negotiations for an [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|agreement between Iran and world powers]] over Iran's nuclear program.<ref name="BroadLetter">William J.

On May 17, 2017, it was reported that Lieberman was a frontrunner to replace FBI Director [[James Comey]], who was [[Dismissal of James Comey|fired]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] on May 9, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dawsey|first1=Josh|title=Lieberman emerges as front-runner for FBI post|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/18/joe-lieberman-fbi-frontrunner-238563|website=Politico|publisher=Politico LLC|access-date=18 May 2017}}</ref>
