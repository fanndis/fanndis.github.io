{{Segregation}}
{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''Racial segregation''' is the systematic separation of people into [[race (human classification)|racial]] or other [[Ethnicity|ethnic groups]] in daily life. Racial segregation can amount to the international [[crime of apartheid]] and a [[crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]] under the [[Statute of the International Criminal Court]]. Segregation can involve the [[wikt:spatial|spatial]] separation of the races, and mandatory use of different institutions, such as schools and hospitals by people of different races. Specifically, it may be applied to activities such as eating in restaurants, drinking from water fountains, using public toilets, attending schools, going to movies, riding buses, renting or purchasing homes or renting hotel rooms.<ref>''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill & Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]</ref> In addition, segregation often allows close contact between members of different racial or ethnic groups in [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] situations, such as allowing a person of one race to work as a servant for a member of another race.

Segregation is defined by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] as "the act by which a (natural or legal) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds without an objective and reasonable justification, in conformity with the proposed definition of discrimination. As a result, the voluntary act of separating oneself from other people on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds does not constitute segregation".<ref>[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/activities/GPR/EN/Recommendation_N7/Recommendation_7_en.asp ECRI General Policy Recommendation N°7: National legislation to combat racism and racial discrimination] — Explanatory memorandum, Para. 16</ref> According to the UN Forum on Minority Issues, "The creation and development of classes and schools providing education in minority languages should not be considered impermissible segregation, if the assignment to such classes and schools is of a voluntary nature".<ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.11.Add.1.pdf Recommendations of the Forum on Minority Issues A/HRC/10/11/Add.1] — para. 27</ref>

Racial segregation has generally been outlawed worldwide. In the [[United States]], [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] was mandated by law in some states (see [[Jim Crow laws]]) and enforced along with [[anti-miscegenation laws]] (prohibitions against [[interracial marriage]]), until the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] led by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] struck down racial segregationist laws throughout the United States.<ref>E.g., Virginia [[Racial Integrity Act]], Virginia Code § 20–58 and § 20–59</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/brown/history/5-decision/courts-decision.html|title=The Court's Decision - Separate Is Not Equal|website=americanhistory.si.edu|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73968804.pdf|title=The Warren Court: Completion of a Constitutional Revolution|website=William & Mary Law School Scholarship Repository|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003223936/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73968804.pdf|archive-date=3 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/347us483|title=Brown v.

Schelling (1969) "Models of segregation", ''American Economic Review'', 1969, 59(2), [https://web.archive.org/web/20160102101610/http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic185351.files/shelling1.pdf 488–493].</ref> Segregation may be maintained by means ranging from discrimination in hiring and in the rental and sale of housing to certain races to [[vigilante]] violence (such as [[lynching]]s). Generally, a situation that arises when members of different races mutually prefer to associate and do business with members of their own race would usually be described as ''separation'' or ''[[de facto]] separation'' of the races rather than ''segregation''.

==Historic cases from 10,000 BC to the 1960s==
Wherever multiracial communities have existed, racial segregation has also been practiced. Only areas with extensive [[interracial marriage]], such as [[Hawaii]] and [[Brazil]], seem to be exempt from it, despite some social stratification within them.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/488135/racial-segregation Racial segregation].

===Imperial China===
====Tang dynasty====
Several laws which enforced racial segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed by the [[Han Chinese]] during the [[Tang dynasty]].{{cn|date=June 2020}} In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from pretending to be Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqAGIL02BWQC&q=chinese+uighurs+779+edict+lure+canton+836+foreigners+and+chinese+lu+governor+forbade+marriages+forced+separate&pg=PA22 |title=The golden peaches of Samarkand: a study of Tʻang exotics |author=Edward H.

====Qing dynasty====
{{Main|Eight Banners}}

The [[Qing dynasty]] was founded not by the Han Chinese who form the majority of the Chinese population, but the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], who are today an ethnic minority of China. The Manchus were keenly aware of their minority status, however, it was only later in the dynasty that they banned intermarriage.

Han defectors played a massive role in the Qing conquest of China. Han Chinese Generalse of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Dynasty]] who defected to the Manchu were often [[Heqin#Qing dynasty|given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage]] while the ordinary soldiers who defected were given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Manchu leader [[Nurhaci]] married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General [[Li Yongfang]] after he surrendered [[Fushun]] in [[Liaoning]] to the Manchu in 1618.<ref name="ed.

Watson, Ebrey 1991],  pp. 179–180.</ref>

A mass marriage of Han Chinese officers and officials to Manchu women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by Prince Yoto and [[Hongtaiji]] in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups.<ref name="ed. Walthall 2008"/>

[[Geng Zhongming]], a Han bannerman, was awarded the title of Prince Jingnan, and his son Geng Jingmao managed to have both his sons [[Geng Jingzhong]] and Geng Zhaozhong become court attendants under [[Shunzhi Emperor|Shunzhi]] and marry Aisin Gioro women, with Haoge's (a son of Hong Taiji) daughter marrying Geng Jingzhong and Prince Abatai's (Hong Taiji) granddaughter marrying Geng Zhaozhong.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&pg=PA1017|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|first=FREDERIC WAKEMAN|last=JR|date=1 January 1985|publisher=University of California Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780520048041}}</ref>

The Qing differentiated between Han Bannermen and ordinary Han civilians. Han Bannermen were made out of Han Chinese who defected to the Qing up to 1644 and joined the Eight Banners, giving them social and legal privileges in addition to being acculturated to Manchu culture. So many Han defected to the Qing and swelled the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority within the Banners, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han Bannermen dominating at 75%.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=cpfgQNWXpyoC&pg=PA141 Naquin 1987], p. 141.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sZt0TgTAgPoC&pg=PA146 Fairbank, Goldman 2006], p. 2006.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pages.uoregon.edu/inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing3.htm|title=Summing up Naquin/Rawski|website=pages.uoregon.edu}}</ref> It was this multi-ethnic force in which Manchus were only a minority, which conquered China for the Qing.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gAIcwz3V_JsC&pg=PA175 eds. Watson, Ebrey 1991],  p. 175.</ref>

It was Han Chinese Bannermen who were responsible for the successful Qing conquest of China, they made up the majority of governors in the early Qing and were the ones who governed and administered China after the conquest, stabilizing Qing rule.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vI1RRslLNSwC&pg=PA41 Spencer 1990], p. 41.</ref> Han Bannermen dominated the post of governor-general in the time of the Shunzhi and [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi Emperors]], and also the post of governors, largely excluding ordinary Han civilians from the posts.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rXiSxh1oGe0C&pg=PA5 Spence 1988], pp. 4–5.</ref>

To promote ethnic harmony, a 1648 decree from the Manchu [[Shunzhi Emperor]] allowed Han Chinese civilian men to marry Manchu women from the Banners with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners, it was only later in the dynasty that these policies allowing intermarriage were done away with.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140111230216/http://www.chss.iup.edu/chr/CHR-2004Fall-11-WANG-research%20notes-final.pdf Wang 2004, pp. 215–216 & 219–221.]</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXHbhsfaJAYC&pg=PA140|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|first=Anne|last=Walthall|date=1 January 2008|publisher=University of California Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780520254442}}</ref>

The Qing implemented a policy of segregation between the Bannermen of the [[Eight Banners]] (Manchu Bannermen, Mongol Bannermen, Han Bannermen) and Han Chinese civilians{{when|date=July 2015}}. This ethnic segregation had cultural and economic reasons: intermarriage was forbidden to keep up the Manchu heritage and minimize [[sinicization]]. Han Chinese civilians and Mongol civilians [[Willow Palisade|were banned]] from settling in Manchuria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing2.htm |title=From Ming to Qing |publisher=Darkwing.uoregon.edu |access-date=18 January 2010}}</ref> Han civilians and Mongol civilians were banned from crossing into each other's lands. Ordinary Mongol civilians in Inner Mongolia were banned from even crossing into other [[Banners of Inner Mongolia|Mongol Banners]]. (A banner in Inner Mongolia was an administrative division and not related to the Mongol Bannermen in the Eight Banners)

These restrictions did not apply [[Eight Banners|Han Bannermen]], who were settled in Manchuria by the Qing. Han bannermen were differentiated from Han civilians by the Qing and treated differently.

The Qing Dynasty started [[Chuang Guandong|colonizing Manchuria with Han Chinese]] later on in the dynasty's rule, but the Manchu area was still separated from modern-day Inner Mongolia by the [[Willow Palisade|Outer Willow Palisade]], which kept the Manchu and the Mongols in the area separate.

The policy of segregation applied directly to the [[Eight Banners|banner]] garrisons, most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities in which they were stationed. Manchu Bannermen, Han Bannermen, and Mongol Bannermen were separated from the Han civilian population. While the Manchus followed the governmental structure of the preceding [[Ming dynasty]], their ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han Chinese civilian officials who had passed the highest levels of the [[Imperial examinations|state examinations]], and because of the small number of Manchus, this insured that a large fraction of them would be government officials.

===Colonial societies===
====Belgian Congo====
{{Main|Belgian Congo#Social inequality and racial discrimination }}

Though there were no specific laws imposing racial segregation and barring blacks from establishments frequented by whites, ''de facto'' segregation operated in most areas. For example, initially, the [[inner city|city centers]] were reserved to the white population only, while the black population was organized in ''cités indigènes'' (indigenous neighbourhoods called 'le belge'). Hospitals, department stores and other facilities were often reserved for either whites or blacks.

The black population in the cities could not leave their houses from 9 pm to 4 am. This type of segregation began to disappear gradually only in the 1950s, but even then the Congolese remained or felt treated in many respects as second-rate citizens (for instance in political and legal terms).

From 1953, and even more so after the triumphant visit of [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]] to the colony in 1955, Governor-General [[Léon Pétillon]] (1952–1958) worked to create a "Belgian-Congolese community", in which blacks and whites were to be treated as equals.<ref>
Pétillon, L. A. M. (1967), ''Témoignage et réflexions'', Brussels: Renaissance du Livre.
</ref> Regardless, [[anti-miscegenation laws]] remained in place, and between 1959 and 1962 thousands of mixed-race Congolese children were forcibly deported from the Congo by the Belgian government and the [[Catholic Church]] and taken to Belgium.<ref>{{cite news| last = Paravicini| first = Giulia| title = Belgium apologizes for colonial-era abduction of mixed-race children| work = [[Reuters]]| date = 4 April 2019| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belgium-congo/belgium-apologizes-for-colonial-era-abduction-of-mixed-race-children-idUSKCN1RG2NF| access-date = 10 July 2019}}</ref>

====French Algeria====
{{Main|French Algeria#Discrimination}}
{{See also|Indigénat|Assimilation (French colonialism)}}

Following its conquest of [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] controlled [[Algeria]] in 1830, for well over a century France maintained [[French colonial empires|colonial rule]] in the territory which has been described as "quasi-[[apartheid]]".<ref name=Bell>"Algeria was in fact a colony but constitutionally was a part of France and not thought of in the 1950s (even by many on the left) as a colony. It was a society of nine million or so 'Muslim' Algerians who were dominated by the million settlers of diverse origins (but fiercely French) who maintained a quasi-apartheid regime." Bell, David Scott. ''Presidential Power in Fifth Republic France'', Berg Publishers, 2000, p. 36.</ref> The colonial law of 1865 allowed Arab and [[Berbers|Berber]] Algerians to apply for [[French nationality law|French citizenship]] only if they abandoned their [[Islam in Algeria|Muslim]] identity; Azzedine Haddour argues that this established "the formal structures of a political apartheid".<ref>"[the] ''senatus-consulte'' of 1865 stipulated that all the colonised indigenous were under French jurisdiction, i.e., French nationals subjected to French laws, but it restricted citizenship only to those who renounced their Muslim religion and culture. There was an obvious split in French legal discourse: a split between nationality and citizenship which established the formal structures of a political apartheid encouraging the existence of 'French subjects' disenfranchised, without any rights to citizenship, treated as objects of French law and not citizens". Debra Kelly. ''Autobiography And Independence: Selfhood and Creativity in North African Postcolonial Writing in French'', Liverpool University Press, 2005, p. 43.</ref> Camille Bonora-Waisman writes that, "in contrast with the Moroccan and Tunisian protectorates", this "colonial apartheid society" was unique to Algeria.<ref name=Bonora-Waisman>"In contrast with the Moroccan and Tunisian protectorates, Algeria was made an integral part of France and became a colony of settlement for more than one million Europeans... under colonial rule, Algerians encountered France's 'civilising mission' only through the plundering of lands and colonial apartheid society..." Bonora-Waisman, Camille. ''France and the Algerian Conflict: Issues in Democracy and Political Stability, 1988–1995'', Ashgate Publishing, 2003, p. 3.</ref>

This "internal system of apartheid" met with considerable resistance from the Muslims affected by it, and is cited as one of the causes of the [[Toussaint Rouge|1954 insurrection]] and ensuing [[Algerian War|independence war]].<ref name=Wall>"As a settler colony with an internal system of apartheid, administered under the fiction that it was part of metropolitan France, and endowed with a powerful colonial lobby that virtually determined the course of French politics with respect to its internal affairs, it experienced insurrection in 1954 on the part of its Muslim population." Wall, Irwin M. ''France, the United States, and the Algerian War'', University of California Press, 2001, p. 262.</ref>

====Rhodesia====
{{Further|Land reform in Zimbabwe#Creation of the Tribal Trust Lands|l1 = South Rhodesia Land Apportionment Act}}

[[File:Rhodesialand.png|thumb|Land apportionment in Rhodesia in 1965]]

The [[Land Apportionment Act of 1930]] passed in [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now known as [[Zimbabwe]]) was a segregationist measure that governed land allocation and acquisition in rural areas, making distinctions between blacks and whites.<ref>A. C. JENNINGS, LAND APPORTIONMENT IN SOUTHERN RHODESIA, African Affairs, Volume XXXIV, Issue CXXXVI, July 1935, Pages 296–312, https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a100934</ref>

One highly publicized legal battle occurred in 1960 involving the opening of a new theatre that was to be open to all races; the proposed unsegregated [[public toilet]]s at the newly built [[Reps Theatre]] in 1959 caused an argument called [[Reps_Theatre#"The_Battle_of_the_Toilets"|"The Battle of the Toilets"]].

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the lives of [[History of Jews in Iran|Persian Jews]]:
{{quote|…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town…; for they are considered as unclean creatures…  Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…  For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans…  If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults. The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him… unmercifully…  If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods… Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)…, he is sure to be murdered.<ref>Lewis (1984), pp. 181–183</ref>}}

====Fascist Italy====
{{Main|Italian Fascism and racism}}

In 1938, the [[Italian Fascism|fascist regime]] which was led by [[Benito Mussolini]], under pressure from the Nazis, introduced a series of [[Italian Racial Laws|racial laws]] which instituted an official segregationist policy in the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian Empire]], which was especially directed against [[Italian Jews]]. This policy enforced various segregationist norms, like the laws which banned Jews from teaching or studying in ordinary schools and universities, owning industries which were reputed to be very important to the nation, working as journalists, entering the military, and marrying non-Jews.
Some of the immediate consequences of the introduction of the 'provvedimenti per la difesa della razza' (norms for the defence of the race) included many of the best Italian scientists leaving their jobs, or even leaving Italy. Amongst these were the world-renowned physicists [[Emilio Segrè]], [[Enrico Fermi]] (whose wife was Jewish), [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], [[Bruno Rossi]], [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], mathematicians [[Federigo Enriques]] and [[Guido Fubini]] and even the fascist propaganda director, art critic and journalist [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who was one of Mussolini's mistresses. [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]], who would successively win the [[Nobel Prize for Medicine]], was forbidden to work at the university. [[Albert Einstein]], upon passage of the racial law, resigned from his honorary membership in the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].

After 1943, when [[Northern Italy]] was [[Kingdom of Italy#Civil war (1943–1945)|occupied by the Nazis]], Italian Jews were rounded up and became victims of the [[The Holocaust in Italy|Holocaust]].

Under the General Government of [[occupied Poland]] in 1940, the Nazis divided the population into different groups, each with different rights, food rations, allowed housing strips in the cities, public transportation, etc. In an effort to split Polish identity they attempted to establish ethnic divisions of [[Kashubians]] and [[Gorals]] ([[Goralenvolk]]), based on these groups' alleged "Germanic component".

During the 1930s and 1940s, Jews in Nazi-controlled states were made to wear something that identified them as Jewish, such as a [[yellow badge|yellow ribbon or star of David]], and were, along with [[Romani people|Romas]] (Gypsies), discriminated against by the racial laws. Jewish doctors were not allowed to treat Aryan patients nor were Jewish professors permitted to teach Aryan pupils. In addition, Jews were not allowed to use any public transportation, besides the ferry, and were able to shop only from 3–5 pm in Jewish stores. After ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' ("The Night of Broken Glass"), the Jews were fined 1,000,000 [[German reichsmark|marks]] for damages done by the Nazi troops and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members.

Jews and Roma were subjected to [[genocide]] as "undesirable" racial groups in the [[Holocaust]]. The Nazis established [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939–1944|ghettos]] to confine Jews and sometimes Romas into tightly packed areas of the cities of Eastern Europe, turning them into ''[[de facto]]'' [[concentration camp]]s. The [[Warsaw Ghetto]] was the largest of these ghettos, with 400,000 people. The [[Łódź Ghetto]] was the second largest, holding about 160,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/timeline/ghettos.htm |title=Holocaust Timeline: The Ghettos |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date=23 November 1939 |access-date=18 January 2010}}</ref>

Between 1939 and 1945, at least 1.5 million [[Poland|Polish]] citizens were transported to the Reich for [[forced labour]] (in all, about 12 million forced laborers were employed in the German war economy inside [[Nazi Germany]]).<ref>{{cite web |author=Michael Marek (nda) |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html |title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers |publisher=Dw-world.de |access-date=18 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |title=Forced Labor at Ford Werke AG during the Second World War |publisher=Summeroftruth.org |access-date=18 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014235036/http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |archive-date=14 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Although Nazi Germany also used forced laborers from Western Europe, [[Poles]], along with other Eastern Europeans viewed as racially inferior,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |title=Hitler's Plans |publisher=Dac.neu.edu |access-date=5 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401234751/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |archive-date=1 April 2010 }}</ref>  were subject to deeper discriminatory measures. They were forced to wear a yellow with purple border and letter "[[P (Nazi symbol)|P]]" (for Polen/Polish) cloth identifying tag sewn to their clothing, subjected to a [[curfew]], and banned from [[public transportation]].

While the treatment of factory workers or farm hands often varied depending on the individual employer, Polish laborers as a rule were compelled to work longer hours for lower wages than Western Europeans – in many cities, they were forced to live in segregated barracks behind barbed wire. Social relations with [[Germans]] outside work were forbidden, and sexual relations (''[[Rassenschande]]'' or "racial defilement") were punishable by death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-trc.org/poles.htm |title=Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era |publisher=Holocaust-trc.org |access-date=18 January 2010}}</ref>

{{Main|Apartheid}}

[[File:DurbanSign1989.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"[[Apartheid]]": sign on Durban beach in English, [[Afrikaans]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]]]]

The [[apartheid]] system carried out by [[Afrikaner]] minority rule enacted a nationwide social policy "separate development" with the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] victory in the [[1948 South African general election|1948 general election]], following the "colour bar"-discriminatory legislation dating back to the beginning of the [[Union of South Africa]] and the [[Boer Republics|Boer republics]] before which, while repressive to black South Africans along with other minorities, had not gone nearly so far.

Apartheid laws can be generally divided into following acts. Firstly, the [[Population Registration Act, 1950|Population Registration Act]] in 1950 classified residents in South Africa into four racial groups: "black", "white", "[[Coloured]]", and "Indian" and noted their racial identities on their identifications. Secondly, the [[Group Areas Act]] in 1950 assigned different regions according to different races. People were forced to live in their corresponding regions and the action of passing the boundaries without a permit was made illegal, extending pass laws that had already curtailed black movement. Thirdly, under the [[Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, 1953|Reservation of Separate Amenities Act]] in 1953, amenities in public areas, like hospitals, universities and parks, were labeled separately according to particular races. In addition, the [[Bantu Education Act, 1953|Bantu Education Act]] in 1953 segregated national education in South Africa as well. Additionally, the government of the time enforced the [[pass laws]], which deprived black South Africans of their right to travel freely within their own country. Under this system black people were severely restricted from urban areas, requiring authorisation from a white employer to enter.

Uprisings and protests against apartheid appeared immediately when apartheid arose. As early as 1949, the [[African National Congress Youth League|Youth League]] of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) advocated the ending of apartheid and suggested fighting against racial segregation by various methods. During the following decades, hundreds of anti-apartheid actions occurred, including those of the [[Black Consciousness Movement]], students' protests, labor strikes, and church group activism etc. In 1991, the [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991|Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act]] was passed, repealing laws enforcing racial segregation, including the Group Areas Act.<ref>Reinhard Zimmermann (1996). "Southern Cross: Civil Law and Common Law in South Africa". p. 90. Clarendon Press</ref> In 1994, [[Nelson Mandela]] won in the first [[1994 South African general election|multiracial democratic election]] in South Africa. His success fulfilled the ending of apartheid in South African history.

After the passage of [[Jim Crow laws]] which segregated [[African Americans]] and [[White Americans|Whites]], the people who were negatively affected by those laws saw no progress in their quest for equality. Racial segregation was not a new phenomenon, as illustrated by the fact that almost four million blacks had been [[slavery in the United States|enslaved]] before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>{{cite news|title=How the end of slavery led to starvation and death for millions of black Americans|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/16/slavery-starvation-civil-war|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Leon Litwack 2004">Leon Litwack, ''Jim Crow Blues'', Magazine of History (OAH Publications, 2004)</ref> The laws passed segregated African Americans from Whites in order to enforce a system of white supremacy.

After the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in America, [[Racism in the United States|racial discrimination]] became regulated by the so-called [[Jim Crow laws]], which mandated strict segregation of the races. Though many such laws were instituted shortly after fighting ended, they only became formalized after the 1877 end of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction period]]. The period that followed is known as the [[nadir of American race relations]]. The legislation (or in some states, such as [[Florida]], the [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]]) that mandated segregation lasted at least until a 1968 ruling by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] outlawing all forms of segregation.

While the U.S. Supreme Court majority in the 1896 ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' case explicitly permitted "[[separate but equal]]" facilities (specifically, transportation facilities), Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]], in his [[dissenting opinion|dissent]], protested that the decision was an expression of [[white supremacy]]; he predicted that segregation would "stimulate aggressions … upon the admitted rights of colored citizens", "arouse race hate", and "perpetuate a feeling of distrust between [the] races.

Institutionalized racial segregation was ended as an official practice during the [[civil rights movement]] by the efforts of such civil rights activists as [[Clarence M.

On 28 April 2007, the [[Council of Representatives of Bahrain|lower house]] of [[National Assembly of Bahrain|Bahraini Parliament]] passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. To justify the law MP Nasser Fadhala, a close ally of the government said "bachelors also use these houses to make alcohol, run prostitute rings or to rape children and housemaids".<ref name="migrantworkers3"/>

Sadiq Rahma, technical committee head, who is a member of [[Al Wefaq]] said: "The rules we are drawing up are designed to protect the rights of both the families and the Asian bachelors (..) these labourers often have habits which are difficult for families living nearby to tolerate (..) they come out of their homes half dressed, brew alcohol illegally in their homes, use prostitutes and make the neighbourhood dirty (..) these are poor people who often live in groups of 50 or more, crammed into one house or apartment," said Mr Rahma. "The rules also state that there must be at least one bathroom for every five people (..) there have also been cases in which young children have been sexually molested."<ref>{{cite news | author = Tariq Kkonji | url = http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=133367 | title = 'No go' rule for bachelor labourers | newspaper = [[Gulf Daily News]] | date=23 January 2006 | access-date=2 January 2012|author-link = Tariq Kkonji}}</ref>

Until 1965, segregation in schools existed legally in [[Ontario]] and [[Nova Scotia]], and informally in other provinces.<ref>https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/racial-segregation-of-black-people-in-canada</ref>

Since the 1970s, there has been a concern expressed by some academics that major Canadian cities are becoming more segregated on income and ethnic lines. Reports have indicated that the inner suburbs of post-merger [[Toronto]]<ref name=huffingtonpost1 /> and the southern [[bedroom communities]] of [[Greater Vancouver]]<ref name=huffingtonpost1>{{cite news|last=Mendelson|first=Rachel|title=Vancouver Income Inequality Study Shows City Segregating Along Racial, Income Lines|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/12/vancouver-income-inequality-study_n_1334796.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=12 March 2012|access-date=22 February 2015}}</ref> have become steadily more immigrant and [[visible minority]] dominated communities and have lagged behind other neighbourhoods in average income. A [[CBC News|CBC]] panel in Vancouver in 2012 discussed the growing public fear that the proliferation of [[ethnic enclaves]] in Greater Vancouver (such as [[Chinese Canadians in Greater Vancouver|Han Chinese]] in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] and [[Punjabis in Vancouver|Punjabis]] in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]]) amounted to a type of [[self-segregation]]. In response to these fears, many minority activists have pointed out that most Canadian neighbourhoods remain predominately White, and yet Whites are never accused of "self-segregation".

[[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] proclaims equal rights to all [[Israeli citizenship law|citizens]] regardless of ethnicity, denomination or race. Israel has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality (such as prohibition of [[Prohibition of Discrimination in Products, Services and Entry into Places of Entertainment and Public Places Law, 2000|discrimination]], [[Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, 1988|equality in Employment]], libel based on race or ethnicity.<ref>[[:he:חוק איסור לשון הרע]]</ref>).

Due to many cultural differences, and animosity towards a minority perceived to wish to annihilate Israel, a system of passively co-existing communities, segregated along ethnic lines has emerged in Israel, with Arab-Israeli minority communities being left "marooned outside the mainstream". This de facto segregation also exists between different Jewish ethnic groups ("''edot''") such as [[Sepharadim]], [[Ashkenazim]] and [[Beta Israel]] (Jews of Ethiopian descent),<ref>{{cite book|title=Ethiopian Jewish Immigrants in Israel: The Homeland Postponed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwgJDV8Ho0cC&pg=9|page=9|year=2001|first=Tanya|last=Schwartz|isbn=9780700712380}}</ref> which leads to de facto segregated schools, housing and public policy.

=== Kenya ===
The end of [[Kenya Colony|British colonial rule in Kenya]] in 1964 led to an inadvertent increase in ethnic segregation. Through private purchases and government schemes, farm land previously held by [[White people in Kenya|European farmers]] was transferred to African owners. These farms were further sub-divided into smaller localities, and, due to joint migration, many adjacent localities were occupied by members of different ethnic groups.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Undercurrents of Ethnic Conflicts in Kenya |last=Oucho |first=John |publisher=Brill |year=2002 |isbn=978-90-04-12459-2 |location=Leiden }}</ref>{{pages needed|date=April 2017}} This separation along these boundaries persists today.

There may be some indication that such segregation, particularly in residential terms, seems to be the result of the unilateral 'steering' of ethnic groups into particular areas as well as a culture of vendor discrimination and distrust of ethnic minority clients by some estate agents and other property professionals.<ref>PHILLIPS, D. (2002) Movement to opportunity? South Asian relocation in northern cities. End of Award report, ESRC R000238038. School of Geography, University of Leeds.

This is likely as other theories such as "ethnic [[Auto-segregation|self segregation]]" have sometimes been shown to be baseless, and a majority of ethnic respondents to a few surveys on the matter have been in favour of wider social and residential integration.<ref name="ccsr.ac.uk"/>

Regulations ensure that all housing units are expensive enough to prevent access by undesirable groups. By bidding up the price of housing, many white neighborhoods effectively shut out black people, because they may be unwilling, or unable, to pay the premium to buy entry into these expensive neighborhoods. Conversely, equivalent housing in black neighborhoods is far more affordable to those who are unable or unwilling to pay a premium to live in white neighborhoods. Through the 1990s, residential segregation remained at its extreme and has been called "[[hypersegregation]]" by some sociologists or "American Apartheid".<ref>{{cite book |author=Massey D.S., Denton N.
