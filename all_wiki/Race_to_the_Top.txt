'''Race to the Top''', abbreviated '''R2T''', '''RTTT''' or '''RTT''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html|title=Race to the Top Fund|date=2016-07-19|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-21}}</ref> was a $4.35 billion [[United States Department of Education]] competitive grant created to spur and reward innovation and reforms in state and local district [[K–12]] education. Funded as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], it was announced by President [[Barack Obama]] and Secretary of Education [[Arne Duncan]] on July 24, 2009. States competing for the grants were awarded points for enacting certain educational policies, instituting performance-based evaluations for teachers and principals based on multiple measures of educator effectiveness (tied to targeted professional development and feedback), adopting common standards (though adoption of the [[Common Core]] state standards was not required), adopting policies that did not prohibit (or effectively prohibit) the expansion of high-quality [[charter schools]], turning around the lowest-performing schools, and building and using data systems.

==Criteria for funding==
{{Nudge Theory}}
State applications for funding were scored on selection criteria worth a total of 500 points. In order of weight, the selection criteria were:<ref name="execsummary">{{cite web

* '''Data systems to support instruction (47 total points)'''
** Fully implementing a statewide longitudinal data system (24 points)
** Using data to improve instruction (18 points)
** Accessing and using State data (5 points)

In addition to the 485 possible points from the selection criteria above, applicants were assessed based on six priorities, including the prioritization of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education which is worth another fifteen points for a possible total of 500.<ref name="execsummary" />
* '''Priority 1, absolute priority''': comprehensive approach to education reform
* '''Priority 2, competitive preference priority''': emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (This priority was worth 15 points, bringing the "selection criteria" total to 500 points)
* '''Priority 3, invitational priority''': innovations for improving early learning outcomes
* '''Priority 4, invitational priority''': expansion and adaptation of statewide longitudinal data systems
* '''Priority 5, invitational priority''': P-20 coordination, vertical and horizontal alignment
* '''Priority 6, invitational priority''': school-level conditions for reform, innovation, and learning

The applications for Race to the Top were bolstered by local involvement: states were incentivized to get buy-in from school district superintendents and teacher unions; applications required signatures from the states' education chiefs, governors, and attorneys general in order to qualify.<ref name="execsummary" />

==Effects==
Several states changed their education policies to make their applications more competitive.  For instance, Illinois increased the cap on the number of charter schools it allows from 60 to 120; Massachusetts passed legislation to "aggressively intervene in [its] lowest-performing schools", and West Virginia proposed, but did not establish, a performance-based salary system that would have included student achievement in its compensation calculations.<ref name="phase2applications">{{cite web

==Awards==
States were eligible for different funding award brackets depending on their share of the federal population of children between the ages of 5-17.  Phase 1 award bands ranged from $20–75 million up to the highest phase 1 award range of $350–$700 million.  Only the four largest states, by population, ([[California]], [[Texas]], [[Florida]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]) were eligible for this highest bracket. Over three rounds, 18 states plus the District of Columbia were awarded grants totaling $4.1 billion (not including RTTT-Early Learning Challenge grants). These awardees in aggregate serve approximately 22 million students making up approximately 45% of the all K-12 students in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/settingthepacerttreport_3-2414_b.pdf

Alaska, North Dakota, Texas, and Vermont did not submit Race to the Top applications for either round.

After both rounds, the Department of Education released the complete scoring of each application, with the intention of making the scoring process more transparent and helping states revise their applications to be more competitive for the second round of competition.

Round 1 (a.k.a. Phase 1) winners were announced on March 29, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/delaware-and-tennessee-win-first-race-top-grants

As a part of Race to the Top, the U.S. Department of Education puts out an Annual Performance Report (APR), cataloguing the grantees' progress in implementing reform plans and meeting goals for student outcomes.<ref name="APR">{{cite web

APR's are created for each state to document the progress toward the annual and four-year targets set forth in the grantees' applications. Because the performance measures included in the applications are indicators of success in improving student outcomes, the APR is one way to hold states accountable for meeting targets in improving student outcomes. An APR also includes reports and updates on laws, statutes, regulations, and/or guidelines that impact reform plans, as well as progress in meeting the "absolute priority" and "competitive preference priority", which emphasize a comprehensive focus on reform and an emphasis on STEM education. The APR includes updates on progress in meeting the invitation priorities in the approved plans (innovations for improving early learning outcomes; expansion and adaptation of statewide longitudinal data systems; P-20 coordination, vertical and horizontal alignment; and school-level conditions for reform, innovation, and learning).<ref name="performance">{{cite web

Race to the Top states like Georgia, North Carolina, and Florida successfully integrated multiple data systems to provide a range of tailored resources and information for different audiences (e.g., teachers, students, parents). In such integrated systems, students can access their assignments, grades and learning activities; parents can view the academic expectations of their child, and his or her school attendance and grades; and teachers and principals can access their students’ data and find strategies and resources (e.g., sample lesson plans) to meet their instructional needs. Access to data and training that help teachers improve instruction to meet their students’ needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/rttfinalrptfull.pdf|title=Fundamental Change Innovation in America’s Schools Under Race to the Top|last=|first=|date=|website=ed.gov|accessdate=2017-10-22}}</ref>

Race to the Top states provided extensive training opportunities for teachers to increase their data analysis skills and use student performance data to customize learning for individual students. Teachers are using new data and tools to effectively and quickly check on students’ progress and understanding in the course of a single session or over a few weeks.

==Criticisms==

Although the vast majority of states have competed to win the grants, Race to the Top has also been criticized by politicians, policy analysts, thought leaders, and educators. Teachers' unions argued that state tests are an inaccurate way to measure teacher effectiveness, considering the fact that learning gains on assessments is only one component of the evaluation systems.

A coalition of civil rights organizations, including the [[Urban League]],  the [[NAACP Legal Defense Fund]] and the [[Rainbow/PUSH]] Coalition released a statement that "Such an approach reinstates the antiquated and highly politicized frame for distributing federal support to states that civil rights organizations fought to remove in 1965."<ref>Darby, Seyward, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128843021 Defending Obama's Education Plan] ''New Republic''</ref><ref>McNeil, Michelle, [http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2010/07/civil_rights_groups_call_for_n.html Civil Rights Groups Call for New Federal Education Agenda], ''Education Week''</ref>
