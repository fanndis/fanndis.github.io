==History==
[[File:1stChurchofChrist FarmingtonCT.jpg|thumb|Congregational Church in Connecticut.]]
{{Main|Congregational Christian Churches|Evangelical and Reformed Church}}
The United Church of Christ was formed when two Protestant churches, the [[Evangelical and Reformed Church]] and the General Council of the Congregational Christian Churches united in 1957.<ref name="UCC-WhatIs">{{cite web |url=http://www.ucc.org/about-us/what-is-the-united-church-of.html|title=What is the United Church of Christ|publisher=ucc.org| access-date=2010-01-16}}</ref><ref name="UCC-ShortCourse">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/about-us/short-course/the-united-church-of-christ.html|title=The United Church of Christ|publisher=ucc.org|access-date=2010-01-16}}</ref><ref name="Gunnemann1977">{{cite book |last=Gunnemann|first=Louis H.|title=The Shaping of the United Church of Christ |url=https://archive.org/details/shapingofunitedc00loui|url-access=registration|year=1977|publisher=United Church Press |isbn=0829813454}}</ref> This union adopted an earlier general statement of unity between the two denominations, the 1943 "Basis of Union".<ref name=BasisUnion>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/beliefs/basis-of-union.html|title=Basis of Union|website=ucc.org}}</ref> At this time, the UCC claimed about two million members.<ref name="UCC-ShortCourse" /> In 1959, in its General Synod, the UCC adopted a broad "Statement of Faith".<ref name=FaithStatement>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/beliefs/statement-of-faith.html|title=Statement of Faith of the United Church of Christ - La Declaración de Fe de la Iglesia Unida de Cristo|website=ucc.org}}</ref> The UCC adopted its constitution and by-laws in 1961.<ref name="UCC-ShortCourse" />

==Beliefs==
There is no UCC hierarchy or body that can impose any doctrine or worship format onto the individual congregations within the UCC.<ref name="UCC-Testimonies">{{cite web|title=Testimonies, not Tests |publisher=UCC |url=http://i.ucc.org/StretchYourMind/UCC101/TestimoniesofFaith/tabid/88/Default.aspx |access-date=2010-01-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201212501/http://i.ucc.org/StretchYourMind/UCC101/TestimoniesofFaith/tabid/88/Default.aspx |archive-date=February 1, 2010 }}</ref> While individual congregations are supposed to hold guidance from the general synod "in the highest regard", the UCC's constitution requires that the "autonomy of the Local Church is inherent and modifiable only by its own action".<ref name="UCC-Constitution">{{cite web |title = Constitution and Bylaws of the United Church of Christ|publisher = UCC |url = http://www.ucc.org/about-us/constitution-of-the-ucc.html#LOCAL |access-date = 2010-01-22}}</ref>

[[File:South Parish Congregational Church and Parish House.jpg|thumb|South Parish Congregational Church and Parish House in Augusta, Maine in 2013.]]
Within this locally focused structure, however, there are central beliefs common to the UCC. The UCC often uses four words to describe itself: "Christian, [[Reformed churches|Reformed]], [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] and Evangelical".<ref name="UCC-BriefHistory">{{cite web|title=What is the United Church of Christ? A brief history |publisher=UCC |url=http://i.ucc.org/StretchYourMind/UCC101/BriefHistoryoftheUCC/tabid/93/Default.aspx |access-date=2010-01-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302195024/http://i.ucc.org/StretchYourMind/UCC101/BriefHistoryoftheUCC/tabid/93/Default.aspx |archive-date=March 2, 2010 }}</ref> While the UCC refers to its ''evangelical'' characteristics, it springs from (and is considered part of) mainline Protestantism as opposed to [[Evangelicalism]].  The word evangelical in this case more closely corresponds with the original Lutheran origins meaning "of the gospel" as opposed to the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] use of the word. UCC is generally [[Liberal Christianity|theologically liberal]], and the denomination notes that the "Bible, ''though written in specific historical times and places'', still speaks to us in our present condition".<ref name="UCC-BriefHistory" />

The motto of the United Church of Christ comes from [[John 17:21]]: "That they may all be one". The denomination's official literature uses broad doctrinal parameters, emphasizing freedom of individual conscience and local church autonomy.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

===Historic confessions===
In the United Church of Christ, [[creed]]s, confessions, and affirmations of faith function as "testimonies of faith" around which the church gathers rather than as "tests of faith" rigidly prescribing required doctrinal consent. As expressed in the United Church of Christ constitution:

<blockquote>The United Church of Christ acknowledges as its sole Head, Jesus Christ, Son of God and Savior. It acknowledges as kindred in Christ all who share in this confession. It looks to the Word of God in the Scriptures, and to the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, to prosper its creative and redemptive work in the world. It claims as its own the faith of the historic Church expressed in the ancient creeds and reclaimed in the basic insights of the Protestant Reformers. It affirms the responsibility of the Church in each generation to make this faith its own in reality of worship, in honesty of thought and expression, and in purity of heart before God. In accordance with the teaching of our Lord and the practice prevailing among evangelical Christians, it recognizes two sacraments: Baptism and the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion.<ref name="UCC-Constitution" /></blockquote>

The denomination, therefore, looks to a number of historic confessions as expressing the common faith around which the church gathers, including:
* The [[Apostles' Creed]],
* The [[Nicene Creed]],
* The [[Heidelberg Catechism]] (inherited from both the German Reformed and German Evangelical heritages),
* [[Luther's Small Catechism]] (inherited from the German Evangelical heritage),
* The [[Kansas City Statement of Faith]] (a 1913 statement in the Congregationalist tradition),
* The Evangelical Catechism (a 1927 catechism in the German Evangelical tradition), and
* The [[Statement of Faith of the United Church of Christ]] (written at the founding of the denomination).

===Studies and surveys of beliefs===
In 2001, Hartford Institute for Religion Research did a "Faith Communities Today" (FACT) study<ref name="UCC-denom ident">{{cite web | last=Lang | first=Andy |date= April 2001 | url=http://www.ucc.org/ucnews/apr01/identity.htm | title=Denominational identity still important |publisher=ucc.org | access-date=2006-12-24 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061220052944/http://www.ucc.org/ucnews/apr01/identity.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2006-12-20}}</ref> that included a survey of United Church of Christ beliefs. Among the results of this were findings that in the UCC, 5.6% of the churches responding to the survey described their members as "very liberal or progressive", 3.4% as "very conservative", 22.4% as "somewhat liberal or progressive", and 23.6% as "somewhat conservative". Those results suggested a nearly equal balance between liberal and conservative congregations. The self-described "moderate" group, however, was the largest at 45%. Other statistics found by the Hartford Institute show that 53.2% of members say "the Bible" is the highest source of authority, 16.1% say the "Holy Spirit", 9.2% say "Reason", 6.3% say "Experience", and 6.1% say "Creeds".

David Roozen, director of the Hartford Institute for Religion Research who has studied the United Church of Christ, said surveys show the national church's pronouncements are often more liberal than the views in the pews but that its governing structure is set up to allow such disagreements.<ref name="Divided">{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Peter |date=2006-11-05 |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061105/NEWS01/611050403/1008/NEWS01 |title=United Church of Christ Divided |publisher=courier-journal.com |access-date=2006-12-24 }}</ref> Starting in 2003, a task force commissioned by General Synod 24 studied the diverse worship habits of UCC churches.

"95 percent of our congregations use the [[Revised Common Lectionary]] in some way in planning or actual worship and preaching" and "96 percent always or almost always have a [[sermon]], 86 percent have a [[Children's message|time with children]], 95 percent have a time of sharing joys and concerns, and 98 percent include the [[Lord's Prayer|Prayer of Our Savior/Lord's Prayer]]." Clergy and laity were invited to select two meanings of baptism that they emphasize. They were also to suggest the meaning that they thought their entire church emphasized. Baptism as an "entry into the Church Universal" was the most frequent response. Clergy and laity were invited to identify two meanings of Holy Communion that they emphasize. While clergy emphasized Holy Communion as "a meal in which we encounter God's living presence", laity emphasized "a remembrance of Jesus' last supper, death, and resurrection".{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

===Relationships with other denominations===
One of the UCC's central beliefs is that it is "called to be a united and uniting church".<ref name="UCC-WhatWeBelieve">{{cite web |title = What we believe |publisher = UCC |url = http://www.ucc.org/about-us/what-we-believe.html |access-date = 2010-01-22}}</ref> Because of this, the UCC is involved in [[Churches Uniting in Christ]], an organization seeking to establish full communion among nine Protestant denominations in America.<ref name="UCC-EcumencialPartnerships">{{cite web |title = Ecumenical partnerships and relationships of full communion |publisher = UCC |url = http://www.ucc.org/ecumenical/ecumenical-partnerships-and.html |access-date = 2010-01-22}}</ref> Currently, the UCC has entered into an ecumenical partnership with the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] and through ''[[A Formula of Agreement]]'', signed in 1997, is in [[full communion]] with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], [[Presbyterian Church USA|Presbyterian Church (USA)]], and the [[Reformed Church in America]].<ref name="UCC-EcumencialPartnerships" /> Internationally, the UCC has been in full communion with the [[Union Evangelischer Kirchen]] (Union of Evangelical Churches) in Germany since 1981.<ref name="UCC-UEK">{{cite web |last=United Church of Christ |year=1981 |url=http://www.ucc.org/ecumenical/kirchengemeinschaft-between.html |title='Kirchengemeinschaft' between the UCC and the Union of Evangelical Churches (UEK) in Germany |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202211540/http://www.ucc.org/ecumenical/kirchengemeinschaft-between.html |archive-date=2014-12-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The UEK is an organization of 13 Reformed and United [[Landeskirche]]n (regional churches) within the federation of Protestant churches known as the [[Evangelical Church of Germany]].

On October 17, 2015, representatives of the United Church of Christ and the [[United Church of Canada]] came together in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]] to sign an historic full communion agreement. This agreement had been approved at the 30th General Synod of the UCC and the 42nd General Council of the United Church of Canada in the summer of 2015 and signifies the mutual desire of both denominations to work in cooperation and openness in the areas of worship, mission, witness, ministry and the proclamation of a common faith. This agreement will allow the two denominations to recognize the validity of each other's sacraments and ordination of ministers and opens up the possibility of ministers being called to serve in congregations of either denomination.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moujaes|first1=Anthony|title=UCC, United Church of Canada formalize full communion through worship, word and sacrament|url=http://www.ucc.org/news_ucc_united_church_of_canada_formalize_full_communion_10192015|website=United Church of Christ|publisher=United Church of Christ|access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Full Communion Agreement Signed|url=http://www.united-church.ca/news/historic-full-communion-agreement-signed|website=The United Church of Canada|publisher=United Church of Canada|access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref>

==Structure==
{{more citations needed|date=May 2019}}
[[File:Old First Church 2010 07 04.jpg|thumb|First Congregational Church in Springfield, Massachusetts.]]
Quoting the United Church of Christ Constitution, "The basic unit of the life and organization of the United Church of Christ is the [[local church]]." An interplay of wider interdependence with local [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] characterizes the organization of the UCC. Each "setting" of the United Church of Christ relates ''covenantally'' with other settings, their actions speaking "to but not for" each other.

The ''ethos'' of United Church of Christ organization is considered "[[Covenant theology|covenantal]]". The ''structure'' of UCC organization is a mixture of the [[Congregationalist church governance|congregational]] and [[Presbyterian church governance|presbyterian]] [[Ecclesiastical polity|polities]] of its predecessor denominations. With ultimate authority given to the local church, many see United Church of Christ polity as closer to congregationalism; however, with ordination and pastoral oversight of licensed, commissioned and ordained ministers conducted by Associations, and General Synod representation given to Conferences instead of congregational delegates, certain similarities to presbyterian polity are also visible.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The UCC's "Covenantal Polity" is best expressed in Article III of the 1999 revision of the Bylaws and Constitution of the United Church of Christ.
"Within the United Church of Christ, the various expressions of the church relate to each other in a covenantal manner.  Each expression of the church has responsibilities and rights in relation to the others, to the end that the whole church will seek God's will and be faithful to God's mission.  Decisions are made in consultation and collaboration among the various parts of the structure.  As members of the Body of Christ, each expression of the church is called to honor and respect the work and ministry of each other part.  Each expression of the church listens, hears, and carefully considers the advise, counsel and requests of others. In this covenant, the various expressions of the United Church of Christ seek to walk together in all God's ways."<ref>(www.ucc.org/aboutus/constitution.htm)</ref>

===Local churches===
[[File:First Congregational United Church of Christ 20080203.jpg|thumb|right|[[First Congregational Church (Long Beach, California)|First Congregational Church]] of [[Long Beach, California]].]]
[[File:2027-BOS-Old South Church0.jpg|thumb|[[Old South Church]], [[Boston]].]]
The basic unit of the United Church of Christ is the ''local church'' (also often called the ''congregation''). Local churches have the freedom to govern themselves, establishing their own internal organizational structures and theological positions. Thus, local church governance varies widely throughout the denomination. Some congregations, mainly of Congregational or Christian Connection origin, have numerous relatively independent "boards" that oversee different aspects of church life, with annual or more frequent meetings (often conducted after a worship service on a Sunday afternoon) of the entire congregation to elect officers, approve budgets and set congregational policy. Other churches, mainly of Evangelical and Reformed descent, have one central "church council" or "[[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]]" that handles most or all affairs in a manner somewhat akin to a [[Presbyterian]] [[Church Session|session]], while still holding an annual congregational meeting for the purpose of electing officers and/or ratifying annual budgets. Still others, usually those congregations started after the 1957 merger, have structures incorporating aspects of both, or other alternative organizational structures entirely.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In almost all cases, though, the selection of a minister for the congregation is, in keeping with the Reformed tradition of the "priesthood of all believers", vested in a congregational meeting, held usually after a special ''ad hoc'' committee searches on the congregation's behalf for a candidate. Members of the congregation vote for or against the committee's recommended candidate for the pastorate, usually immediately after the candidate has preached a "trial sermon;" candidates are usually presented one at a time and not as a field of several to be selected from. Typically the candidate must secure anywhere from 60 to 90 percent affirmative votes from the membership before the congregation issues a formal call to the candidate; this depends on the provisions in the congregation's particular constitution and/or by-laws.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Local churches have, in addition to the freedom to hire ministers and lay staff, the sole power to dismiss them also. However, unlike purely congregational polities, the association has the main authority to [[Ordination|ordain]] clergy and grant membership, or "standing", to clergy coming to a church from another association or another denomination (this authority is exercised "in cooperation with" the person being ordained/called and the local church that is calling them). Such standing, among other things, permits a minister to participate in the UCC clergy pension and insurance plans. Local churches are usually aided in searching for and calling ordained clergy through a denominationally coordinated "search-and-call" system, usually facilitated by staff at the conference level. However, the local church may, for various reasons, opt not to avail itself of the conference placement system, and is free to do so without fear of retaliation, which would likely occur in synodical or presbyterian polities. However, many UCC congregations have constitutions that mandate that their called pastor be an ordained minister approved by the association, while others require that the call of a pastor be approved by the association committee on ministry. Participation in the search and call process is usually considered a sign of the congregation's loyalty to the larger denomination and its work.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

At the end of 2008, 5,320 churches were reported to be within the UCC, averaging 210 members. Sixteen churches were reported to have over 2,000 members, but 64% had fewer than 200 members.<ref name="UCC-Research">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/research/|title=Research Services|publisher=ucc.org|access-date=2010-05-19}}</ref> The latter statistic probably indicates where most of the denomination's declining membership has occurred, in formerly mid-sized congregations between 200 and 500 members or so. The reduction in a typical church's size has also meant that, increasingly, many congregations are no longer able, as they once were, to afford a full-time, seminary-educated pastor, and that some of them have to rely on alternatives such as one of their members serving the church under a license, the use of recently retired clergy on a short-term basis, or ordained ministers serving the church on a half-time (or less) basis while earning their primary income from chaplaincies or other occupations. While this has been occurring to a lesser degree in other mainline denominations as well, the UCC's congregational polity allows for churches to adopt such approaches without ecclesiological restraint, as might happen in a more hierarchical denominational structure.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

===Larger organizations===

====Associations====
{{See also|Associations of the United Church of Christ}}
Local churches are typically gathered together in regional bodies called ''Associations''. Local churches often give financial support to the association to support its activities. The official delegates of an association are all ordained clergy within the bounds of the association together with lay delegates sent from each local church. The association's main ecclesiastical function is to provide primary oversight and authorization of ordained and other authorized ministers; it also is the ecclesiastical link between the local congregation and the larger UCC. The association ordains new ministers, holds ministers' standing in covenant with local churches, and is responsible for disciplinary action; typically a specific ministerial committee handles these duties. Also, an association, again with the assistance of the ministerial committee, admits and removes local congregations from membership in the UCC.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Associations meet at least once annually to elect officers and board members and set budgets for the association's work; fellowship and informational workshops are often conducted during those meetings, which may take place more frequently according to local custom. In a few instances where there is only one association within a conference, or where the associations within a conference have agreed to dissolve, the Conference (below) assumes the association's functions.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

====Conferences====
{{See also|Conferences of the United Church of Christ}}
Local churches also are members of larger ''Conferences'', of which there are 36 in the United Church of Christ. A conference typically contains multiple associations; if no associations exist within its boundaries, the conference exercises the functions of the association as well. Conferences are supported financially through local churches' contribution to "Our Church's Wider Mission" (formerly "Our Christian World Mission"), the United Church of Christ's denominational support system; unlike most associations, they usually have permanent headquarters and professional staff. The primary ecclesiastical function of a conference is to provide the primary support for the search-and-call process by which churches select ordained leadership; the conference minister and/or his or her associates perform this task in coordination with the congregation's pulpit search committee (see above) and the association to which the congregation belongs (particularly its ministerial committee). Conferences also provide significant programming resources for their constituent churches, such as Christian education resources and support, interpretation of the larger UCC's mission work, and church extension within their bounds (the latter usually conducted in conjunction with the national Local Church Ministries division).{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Conferences, like associations, are congregationally representative bodies, with each local church sending ordained and lay delegates. Most current UCC conferences were formed in the several years following the consummation of the national merger in 1961, and in some instances were the unions of former Congregational Christian conferences (led by superintendents) and Evangelical and Reformed synods (led by presidents, some of whom served only on a part-time basis). A few have had territorial adjustments since then; only one conference, the Calvin Synod, composed of Hungarian-heritage Reformed congregations, received exemption from the geographical alignments, with its churches scattered from [[Connecticut]] westward to [[California]] and southward to [[Florida]]. Only one conference has ever withdrawn completely from the denomination: [[Puerto Rico]], expressing disapproval of national UCC tolerance of homosexuality (as well as that of a large number of mainland congregations), departed the denomination in 2006, taking all of its churches.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

====General Synod====
{{See also|Resolutions of the United Church of Christ|General Synods of the United Church of Christ}}
The denomination's churchwide deliberative body is the ''[[General Synod]]'', which meets every two years. The General Synod consists of delegates elected from the Conferences (distributed proportionally by conference size) together with the members of the United Church of Christ Board (see below), the officers of the denomination, and representatives of so-called "Historically Underrepresented Groups", such as the disabled, young adults, racial minorities, and gay and lesbian persons.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

While General Synod provides the most visible voice of the "stance of the denomination" on any particular issue, the covenantal polity of the denomination means that General Synod speaks ''to'' local churches, associations, and conferences, but not ''for'' them. Thus, the other settings of the church are allowed to hold differing views and practices on all non-constitutional matters.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

General Synod considers three kinds of resolutions:
* '''Pronouncements''': A Pronouncement is a statement of Christian conviction on a matter of moral or social principle and has been adopted by a two-thirds vote of a General Synod.
* '''Proposals for Action''': A Proposal for Action is a recommendation for specific directional statements and goals implementing a Pronouncement. A Proposal for Action normally accompanies a Pronouncement. (See link above regarding Pronouncements.)
* '''Resolutions and Other Formal Motions''' Which may consist of the following three types:
** ''Resolutions of Witness'': A Resolution of Witness is an expression of the General Synod concerning a moral, ethical, or religious matter confronting the church, the nation, or the world, adopted for the guidance of the officers, Associated, or Affiliated Ministries, or other bodies as defined in Article VI of the Bylaws of the United Church of Christ; the consideration of local churches, Associations, Conferences, and other bodies related to the United Church of Christ; and for a Christian witness to the world. It represents agreement by at least two-thirds of the delegates voting that the view expressed is based on Christian conviction and is a part of their witness to Jesus Christ.
** ''Prudential Resolutions'': A Prudential Resolution establishes policy, institutes or revises structure or procedures, authorizes programs, approves directions, or requests actions by a majority vote..
** ''Other Formal Motions''

====National offices: covenanted, affiliated, and associated ministries====
As agents of the General Synod, the denomination maintains national offices comprising four "covenanted ministries", one "associated ministry", and one "affiliated ministry". The current system of national governance was adopted in 1999 as a restructure of the national setting, consolidating numerous agencies, boards, and "instrumentalities" that the UCC, in the main, had inherited from the Congregational Christian Churches at the time of merger, along with several created during the denomination's earlier years.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=====Covenanted ministries=====
These structures carry out the work of the General Synod and support the local churches, associations, and conferences. The head executives of these ministries comprise the five member ''Collegium of Officers'', which are the non-hierarchical official officers of the denomination. (The Office of General Ministries is represented by both the General Minister, who serves as President of the denomination, and the Associate General minister). According to the UCC office of communication press release at the time of restructure, "In the new executive arrangement, the five will work together in a Collegium of Officers, meeting as peers. This setting is designed to provide an opportunity for mutual responsibility and reporting, as well as ongoing assessment of UCC programs." The main offices of the Covenanted ministries are at the "Church House", the United Church of Christ national headquarters at 700 Prospect Avenue in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].
* The '''Office of General Ministries (OGM)''' is responsible for administration, common services (technology, physical plant, etc.), covenantal relations (ecumenical relations, formal relations to other settings of the church), financial development, and "proclamation, identity and communication". The current{{when|date=May 2019}} General Minister and President is the Rev. Dr. [[John C. Dorhauer]].
* '''Local Church Ministries (LCM)''' is responsible for evangelism, stewardship and church finance, worship and education, Pilgrim Press and United Church Resources (the publishing house of the United Church of Christ), and parish life and leadership (authorization, clergy development, seminary relations, parish leadership, etc.). The position of Executive Minister of Local Church Ministries is vacant.{{when|date=May 2019}}
* '''Wider Church Ministries (WCM)''' is responsible for partner relations* (relations with churches around the world, missionary work, etc.), local church relations* (as relates to world ministries and missions), global sharing of resources, health and wholeness ministry, and global education and advocacy*. The starred '*' ministries are carried out through the [[Common Global Ministries Board]], a joint instrumentality of the United Church of Christ and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), based in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. WCM is sometimes referred to as the [[United Church Board for World Ministries]], the historic successor to the Congregationalist [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] and the E&R affiliated [[Board of International Missions]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline of Mission|url=http://www.globalministries.org/timeline_of_mission|website=Global Ministries|publisher=Global Ministries|access-date=26 August 2016|quote="1961 ABCFM merges with Board of International Missions to form the United Church Board for World Ministries (UCBWM)"}}</ref> The current{{when|date=May 2019}} Executive Minister for Wider Church Ministries is the Rev. Rev. Jim Moos.
* '''[[Justice and Witness Ministries]] (JWM)''' is responsible for ministries related to economic justice, human rights, justice for women and transformation, public life and social policy, and racial justice. In addition to its offices in Cleveland, JWM also maintains an office on [[Capitol Hill]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The current Executive Minister for Justice and Witness Ministries is Rev. Traci D. Blackmon. JWM also maintains an office called "Minister for Children, Families and Human Sexuality Advocacy" that promotes the [[Our Whole Lives]] [[sex education]] curriculum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/about-us_meet-our-officers|title=Meet Our Officers|website=ucc.org}}</ref>

=====Affiliated ministry=====
The '''Pension Boards of the United Church of Christ (PB-UCC)''' operates the employee benefits systems for all settings of the United Church of Christ, including health, dental, and optical insurance, retirement annuity/pension systems, disability and life insurance, and ministerial assistance programs. The Pension Boards offices are located in [[New York City]], where the headquarters of all UCC national bodies had been located prior to their move to Ohio in the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

'''The Insurance Board''' is a nonprofit corporation collectively "owned" by the [[Conferences of the United Church of Christ]]. It is run by a president/CEO and a 19-member Board, with the full corporate board consisting of Conference, Region and Presbytery ministers as well as laypeople. The IB administers a [[property insurance]], [[liability insurance]], and [[risk management]] program serving the United Church of Christ, the Presbyterian Church(USA), and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) churches and related entities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insuranceboard.org/about_us/who_we_are.aspx|title=United Church of Christ Insurance Board Who We Are|access-date=2011-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813122906/http://www.insuranceboard.org/about_us/who_we_are.aspx|archive-date=2016-08-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=====Associated ministry=====
'''United Church Funds (UCF)''', formerly known as '''The United Church Foundation''', provides low cost, socially responsible,  professionally managed Common Investment Funds (CIFs) and other trustee services to any setting of the United Church of Christ. United Church Funds' offices are also located in [[New York City]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==Activities==
===Civil Rights Movement===
[[Everett Parker]] of the UCC Office of Communication, at the request of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], organized UCC churches during 1959 against television stations in the [[Southern United States]] that were imposing news blackouts of information pertaining to the then growing [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The UCC later won a lawsuit that resulted in a federal court decision that the broadcast air waves are public, not private, property. That led toward the proliferation of people of color in television studios and newsrooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/about-us/ucc-firsts.html|title=UCC Firsts|website=ucc.org}}</ref>

====Statement on the relationship between Israel and Palestinians====
{{Main|Resolutions of United Church of Christ General Synod XXV}}
{{See also|Resolutions of the United Church of Christ }}
United Church of Christ General Synod XXV also passed two resolutions concerning the conflict between Israel and Palestinians in the Middle East. One calls for the use of economic leverage to promote peace in the Middle East, which can include measures such as government lobbying, selective ''investment'', shareholder lobbying, and selective ''[[divestment]]'' from companies which profit from the continuing Israel-Palestine conflict. The other resolution, named "Tear Down the Wall", calls upon Israel to remove the [[separation barrier]] between Israel and the West Bank. Opponents of the "Tear Down the Wall" resolution have noted that the wall's purpose is to prevent terrorist attacks, and that the resolution does not call for a stop to these attacks. The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] stated that the July 2005 UCC resolutions on divestment from Israel were "functionally [[anti-Semitic]]".<ref name="Wiesenthal">[http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nl/content.asp?c=fwLYKnN8LzH&b=312458&content_id=%7B01D1316F-EAA5-42EC-91BB-81E250805BFC%7D&notoc=1 Simon WIESENTHAL Center]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120503/http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nl/content.asp?c=fwLYKnN8LzH&b=312458&content_id=%7B01D1316F-EAA5-42EC-91BB-81E250805BFC%7D&notoc=1 |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> The [[Anti-Defamation League]] stated that those same resolutions are "disappointing and disturbing" and "deeply troubling".<ref name="ADL">[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/4749_62.htm United Church of Christ's Israel Divestment Action "Troubling"; Contravenes Months of Interfaith Dialogue] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050809074822/http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/4749_62.htm |date=2005-08-09 }}.

===Sexuality education===
The United Church of Christ, along with the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] of Congregations, created the [[Our Whole Lives]] curriculum (commonly known as OWL), which is a lifespan, comprehensive, inclusive, and developmentally appropriate sexuality education program. The Whole Lives includes modules for grades K–1, 4–6, 7–9, and 10–12, and for Young Adults and Adults. The Our Whole Lives curricula are secular. Congregations who use this program often also use "Sexuality and Our Faith" for the age level they are offering.  Sexuality and Our Faith are separate manuals which bring in the UUA principles and scripture used in the UCC to support its teachings. The curriculum is based on guidelines provided by the [[Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==="God Is Still Speaking" identity campaign===
[[File:CongregationalChurchRochesterMN.JPG|thumb|"God Is Still Speaking" banner on a UCC church in Rochester, Minnesota]]
At the 2003 General Synod, the United Church of Christ began a campaign with "emphasis on expanding the UCC's name-brand identity through modern advertising and marketing".<ref name="UCC-Billion">{{cite web |last=Winslow |first=William |date=July–August 2003 |url=http://www.ucc.org/ucnews/aug03/billion.htm |title=UCC leader asks for $1 billion in annual giving by 2007 |publisher=ucc.org |access-date=2006-12-25 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061220025141/http://www.ucc.org/ucnews/aug03/billion.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2006-12-20}}</ref> Formally launched during the [[advent season]] in 2004, the campaign included a coordinated program of evangelism and hospitality training for congregations paired with national and local television "brand" advertising, known as the "God is Still Speaking" campaign or "The Stillspeaking Initiative".

Campaign materials, including print and broadcast advertising as well as merchandise, featured the quote and a large [[comma]] with a visual theme in red and black.

==Criticism==
The church's diversity and adherence to covenantal polity (rather than government by regional elders or bishops) give individual congregations a great deal of freedom in the areas of worship, congregational life, and doctrine.
