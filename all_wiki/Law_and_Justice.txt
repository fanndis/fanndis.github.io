==History==
===Formation===
The party was created on a wave of popularity gained by [[Lech Kaczyński]] while heading the [[Polish Ministry of Justice]] (June 2000 to July 2001) in the [[Solidarity Electoral Action|AWS]]-led government, although local committees began appearing from 22 March 2001. The AWS itself was created from a diverse array of many small political parties. In the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001 general election]], PiS gained 44 (of 460) seats in the lower chamber of the Polish Parliament ([[Sejm]]) with 9.5% of votes. In 2002, Lech Kaczyński was elected mayor of [[Warsaw]].  He handed the party leadership to [[Jarosław Kaczyński|his twin brother]] in 2003.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

===In coalition government: 2005–2007===
[[image:4041 Zwycięstwa Street 26 C Białystok.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Former regional office of PiS in Zwycięstwa Street in [[Osiedle Antoniuk, Białystok|Antoniuk District]] of [[Białystok]], May 2019]]
In the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005 general election]], PiS took first place with 27.0% of votes, which gave it 155 out of 460 seats in the Sejm and 49 out of 100 seats in the Senate. It was almost universally expected that the two largest parties, PiS and [[Civic Platform]] (PO), would form a coalition government.<ref name="no Christian Democracy in Poland" /> The putative coalition parties had a falling out, however, related to a fierce contest for the [[2005 Polish presidential election|Polish presidency]]. In the end, Lech Kaczyński won the second round of the presidential election on 23 October 2005 with 54.0% of the vote, ahead of [[Donald Tusk]], the PO candidate.

After the 2005 elections, Jarosław should have become Prime Minister. However, in order to improve his brother's chances of winning the presidential election (the first round of which was scheduled two weeks after the parliamentary election), PiS formed a minority government headed by [[Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz]] as prime minister, an arrangement that eventually turned out to be unworkable. In July 2006, PiS formed a right-wing coalition government with the agrarian populist [[Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland]] and the nationalist [[League of Polish Families]], headed by Jarosław Kaczyński. Association with these parties, on the margins of Polish politics, severely affected the reputation of PiS. When accusations of corruption and sexual harassment against [[Andrzej Lepper]], the leader of Self-Defence, surfaced, PiS chose to end the coalition and called for new elections.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

===In opposition: 2007–2015===
[[File:Jarosław Kaczyński (8736182554).jpg|thumb|[[Jarosław Kaczyński]] and [[Andrzej Duda]], 18 April 2013]]
In the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 general election]], PiS managed to secure 32.1% of votes. Although an improvement over its showing from 2005, the results were nevertheless a defeat for the party, as [[Civic Platform]] (PO) gathered 41.5%. The party won 166 out of 460 seats in the Sejm and 39 seats in [[Senate of Poland|Poland's Senate]].

On 10 April 2010, its former leader Lech Kaczyński died in the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash]]. [[Jarosław Kaczyński]] becomes the sole leader of the party. He was the presidential candidate in the [[2010 Polish presidential election|2010 elections]].

The party won the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015 parliamentary election]], this time with an outright majority—something no Polish party had done since the fall of [[Polish People's Republic|communism]]. In the normal course of events, this should have made Jarosław Kaczyński prime minister for a second time.

The party won reelection in the [[2019 Polish parliamentary election|2019 parliamentary election]]. With 44% of the popular vote, Law and Justice received the highest vote share by any party since Poland returned to democracy in 1989, but lost its majority in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

===Breakaways===
In January 2010, a breakaway faction led by [[Jerzy Polaczek]] split from the party to form [[Poland Plus]]. Its seven members of the Sejm came from the [[Centrism|centrist]], [[Economic liberalization|economically liberal]] wing of the party. On 24 September 2010, the group was disbanded, with most of its Sejm members, including Polaczek, returning to Law and Justice.

On 16 November 2010, MPs [[Joanna Kluzik-Rostkowska]], [[Elżbieta Jakubiak]] and [[Paweł Poncyljusz]], and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] [[Adam Bielan]] and [[Michał Kamiński]] formed a new political group, [[Poland Comes First]] (''Polska jest Najważniejsza'').<ref>[http://www.thenews.pl/national/?id=143599 Law and Justice breakaway politicians form new 'association'], thenews.pl</ref> Kamiński said that the Law and Justice party had been taken over by far-right extremists. The breakaway party formed following dissatisfaction with the direction and leadership of Kaczyński.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/nov/22/conservatives-eu-alliance-michal-kaminski Conservatives' EU alliance in turmoil as Michał Kamiński leaves 'far right' party], ''The Guardian'', 22 November 2010</ref>

On 4 November 2011, MEPs [[Zbigniew Ziobro]], [[Jacek Kurski]], and [[Tadeusz Cymański]] were ejected from the party, after Ziobro urged the party to split further into two separate parties – centrist and nationalist – with the three representing the nationalist faction.<ref>{{cite news |title=Opposition party Law and Justice expels critics |url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/57996,Opposition-party-Law-and-Justice-expels-critics |publisher=[[Polskie Radio]] |date=4 November 2011 |accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref> Ziobro's supporters, most of whom on the right-wing of the party, formed a new group in Parliament called [[Solidary Poland]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Conservative MPs form 'Poland United' breakaway group after dismissals |url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/58134,Conservative-MPs-form-Poland-United-breakaway-group-after-dismissals |publisher=TheNews.pl |date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2012}}</ref> leading to their expulsion, too.<ref>{{cite news |title=MPs axed by Law and Justice opposition

==Base of support==
{{See also|Poland A and B}}
[[File:2015 parliamentary election.png|thumb|right|300px|Law and Justice's main support (dark blue) is concentrated in the south-east of the country (former [[Russian Partition]] and [[Austrian Partition]]), results of the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election]]]]
[[File:Wybory Parlamentarne 2019.png|thumb|right|300px|Law and Justice's main support (dark blue). increased support in the [[2019 Polish parliamentary election]]]]
Like Civic Platform, but unlike the fringe parties to the right, Law and Justice originated from the anti-communist [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade union (which is a major cleavage in Polish politics), which was not a theocratic organisation.<ref>Myant et al. (2008), p. 3</ref> Solidarity's leadership wanted to back Law and Justice in 2005, but was held back by the union's last experience of party politics, in backing [[Solidarity Electoral Action]].<ref name="no Christian Democracy in Poland" />

Today, the party enjoys great support among working class constituencies and union members. Groups that vote for the party include miners, farmers, shopkeepers, unskilled workers, the unemployed, and pensioners. With its left-wing approach toward economics, the party attracts voters who feel that economic liberalisation and European integration have left them behind.<ref name="Tiersky 392" /> The party's core support derives from older, religious people who value conservatism and patriotism. PiS voters are usually located in rural areas and small towns. The strongest region of support is the southeastern part of the country. Voters without a university degree tend to prefer the party more than college-educated voters do.

Regionally, it has more support in regions of Poland that were historically part of western [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia-Lodomeria]] and [[Congress Poland]].<ref>Frank Jacobs, [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/12/zombie-borders/ "Zombie Borders"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' Opinionator blog, 12 December 2011</ref> Since 2015, the borders of support are not as clear as before and party enjoys support in western parts of country, especially these deprived ones.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Large cities in all regions are more likely to vote for more liberal party like [[Civic Platform|PO]] or [[Modern (political party)|.N]]. Still PiS receives good support from poor and working class areas in large cities.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Based on this voter profile, Law and Justice forms the core of the conservative post-Solidarity bloc, along with the [[League of Polish Families]] and [[Solidarity Electoral Action]], as opposed to [[liberal conservative]] post-Solidarity bloc of Civic Platform.<ref>Jungerstam-Mulders (2006), p. 104</ref> The most prominent feature of PiS voters was their emphasis on [[Decommunization|decommunisation]].<ref>Jungerstam-Mulders (2006), p. 103</ref>

==Ideology==
{{update|section|date=October 2020}}
Initially the party was broadly pro-market, although less so than the [[Civic Platform]].<ref name="Tiersky 392">{{cite book |title=Europe Today: a Twenty-first Century Introduction |last=Tiersky |first=Ronald |author2=Jones, Erik  |year=2007 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |location=Lanham |isbn=978-0-7425-5501-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/europetodaytwent00tier |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/europetodaytwent00tier/page/392 392] }}</ref> It has adopted the [[social market economy]] rhetoric similar to that of western European [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties.<ref name="no Christian Democracy in Poland" /> In the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005 election]], the party shifted to the [[protectionism|protectionist]] left on economics.<ref name="Tiersky 392" /> As Prime Minister, [[Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz]] was more [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] than the Kaczyńskis, advocating a position closer to Civic Platform.<ref>Myant et al.

==Platform==
[[File:Beata Szydło (1).jpg|thumb|Beata Szydło - Narodowe Święto Niepodległości]]

===Economy===
The party supports a state-guaranteed minimum [[social safety net]] and state intervention in the economy within [[market economy]] bounds. During the 2015 election campaign, it proposed tax decrease to two personal tax rates (18% and 32%) and tax rebates related to the number of children in a family, as well as a reduction of the [[VAT]] rate (while keeping a variation between individual types of VAT rates). 18% and 32% tax rates were eventually implemented. Also: a continuation of privatization with the exclusion of several dozen state companies deemed to be of strategic importance for the country. PiS opposes cutting social welfare spending, and also proposed the introduction of a system of state-guaranteed housing loans. PiS supports state provided [[universal health care]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rynekzdrowia.pl/Polityka-zdrowotna/PiS-wygrywa-koniec-NFZ-system-budzetowy-i-siec-szpitali,156173,14.html|title=PiS wygrywa: koniec NFZ, system budżetowy i sieć szpitali? - Polityka zdrowotna|publisher=www.rynekzdrowia.pl}}</ref>

===National political structures===
[[File:Narodowego Święto Niepodległości (1).jpg|thumb|PiS meeting on National Independence Day]]
PiS has presented a project for constitutional reform including, among others: allowing the [[President of Poland|president]] the right to pass laws by decree (when prompted to do so by the Cabinet), a reduction of the number of members of the [[Sejm]] and [[Senate of Poland|Senat]], and removal of constitutional bodies overseeing the media and monetary policy. PiS advocates increased criminal penalties. It postulates aggressive anti-corruption measures (including creation of an Anti-Corruption Bureau ([[Central Anticorruption Bureau|CBA]]), open disclosure of the assets of politicians and important public servants), as well as broad and various measures to smooth the working of public institutions.

PiS is a strong supporter of [[lustration]] (''lustracja''), a verification system created ostensibly to combat the influence of the [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa|Communist era security apparatus]] in Polish society. While current lustration laws require the verification of those who serve in public offices, PiS wants to expand the process to include university professors, lawyers, journalists, managers of large companies, and others performing "public functions". Those found to have collaborated with the [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa|security service]], according to the party, should be forbidden to practice in their professions.

===Diplomacy and defense===
The party is in favour of strengthening the [[Polish Armed Forces|Polish Army]] through diminishing bureaucracy and raising military expenditures, especially for modernization of army equipment. PiS planned to introduce a fully professional army and end conscription by 2012 (in August 2008, compulsory military service was abolished in Poland). It is also in favor of participation of Poland in foreign military missions led by the United Nations, [[NATO]] and United States, in countries like [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].

[[File:V4 Prague 2015-12-03 - Viktor Orbán (6).jpg|right|thumb|[[Visegrád Group]] leaders' meeting in Prague, 2015]]
The party supports integration with the [[European Union]] on terms beneficial for Poland. It supports economic integration and tightening the cooperation in areas of energetic security and military, but is skeptical about closer political integration. It is against formation of European [[superstate]] or federation.  PiS is in favor of strong political and military alliance of Poland with the United States.

In the [[European Parliament]] it is a member of the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]], a [[political groups of the European Parliament|group]] founded in 2009 to challenge the prevailing pro-federalist ethos of the [[European Parliament]] and address the perceived ''[[democratic deficit]]'' existing at a European level.

===Social policies===
The party's views on social issues are much more traditionalist than those of [[social conservative]] parties in other European countries.

====Family policies====
The party strongly promotes itself as a pro-family party and encourages married couples to have more children. Prior to 2005 elections, it promised to build 3 million inexpensive housing units as a way to help young couples start a family. Once in government, it passed legislation lengthening [[parental leave]]s.

In 2017, the PiS government commenced the so-called "500+" programme under which all parents residing in Poland receive an unconditional monthly payment of 500 PLN for each second and subsequent child (the 500 PLN support for the first child being linked to income). It also revived the idea of a housing programme based on state-supported construction of inexpensive housing units.

Also in 2017, the party's MPs passed a law that bans most retail trade on Sundays so that workers can spend more time with their families.

==== Abortion stance ====
[[File:02020 0679 Protest against abortion restriction in Kraków, October 2020.jpg|thumb|Anti-PiS poster during the [[October 2020 Polish protests|October 2020 protests]] in Kraków (five stars represent a [[Polish_profanity#Most_commonly_used_vulgarisms|common profanity]], three represent the party name).<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-26|title=Protests over Abortion Ruling Widen, Radicalise and Threaten Polish Government|url=https://balkaninsight.com/2020/10/26/protests-over-abortion-ruling-widen-radicalise-and-threaten-polish-government/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=Balkan Insight|language=en-US}}</ref>]]
Even as [[Abortion in Poland|Poland's abortion laws]] are among the most restrictive in the European Union, PiS additionally opposes abortion resulting from [[Birth defect|foetal defects]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/jaroslaw-kaczynski-o-aborcji-dzieci-z-zespolem-downa-musza-zyc/t2xy3s|title=Jarosław Kaczyński o aborcji.

Despite that PiS has not changed the abortion law in this regard.

The party is also against [[euthanasia]] and [[comprehensive sex education]]. It has also proposed a ban of [[in-vitro fertilisation]].

====Disability rights====
In April 2018, the PiS government announced a PLN 23 billion (EUR 5.5 billion) programme (named "Accessibility+") aimed at reducing barriers for disabled people, to be implemented 2018–2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miir.gov.pl/strony/aktualnosci/inauguracja-programu-dostepnosc-plus-2018-2025/|title=Inauguracja Programu Dostępność Plus 2018-2025 |publisher=Ministerstwo Inwestycji i Rozwoju |language=pl|access-date=2 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://businessinsider.com.pl/wiadomosci/dostepnosc-plus-rzadowy-program-wsparcia-seniorow/5mcjg0p|title=PiS przeznaczy 23 mld zł na program "Dostępność Plus"|date=17 July 2018|work=Business Insider|access-date=2 August 2018|language=pl-PL}}</ref>

Also in April 2018, parents of disabled adults who required long-term care protested in Sejm over what they considered inadequate state support, in particular, the reduction of support once the child turns 18.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/Sejm8.nsf/komunikat.xsp?documentId=ED002FEAAB0BADF5C1258292005A847A|title=Protest of disabled persons in the Sejm - communique from the Sejm Information Centre for the foreign media|publisher=Sejm |language=pl|access-date=2 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/parents-of-disabled-children-occupy-polands-parliament/a-43555600|title=Parents of disabled children occupy Poland's parliament |date=26 April 2018 |publisher=Deutsche Welle |language=en|access-date=2 August 2018}}</ref> As a result, the monthly disability benefit for adults was raised by approx. 15 percent to PLN 1,000 (approx. EUR 240) and certain non-cash benefits were instituted, although protesters' demands of an additional monthly cash benefit were rejected.

====Gay rights====
{{See also|LGBT rights in Poland}}
[[File:LGBT Free Zones Poland 2020.png|thumb|[[LGBT ideology-free zone|LGBT ideology free zones]] in Poland (red) as of January 2020.]]
The party opposes [[LGBT rights]], in particular [[same-sex marriage]]s and any other form of legal recognition of same-sex couples. In 2020, Poland was ranked the lowest of any European Union country for LGBT rights by [[ILGA-Europe]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Poland's culture war: LGBT people forced to turn to civil disobedience |url=https://www.euronews.com/2020/10/06/poland-s-culture-war-lgbt-people-cornered-by-toxic-politics-are-turning-to-civil-disobedie |accessdate=21 October 2020 |work=euronews |date=6 October 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The organization also highlighted instances of [[anti-LGBT rhetoric]] and hate speech by politicians of the ruling party.<ref>[https://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/2020/poland.pdf ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANS, AND INTERSEX PEOPLE IN POLAND COVERING THE PERIOD OF JANUARY TO DECEMBER 2019] ILGA-Europe</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Fitzsimons |first1=Tim |title=Anti-gay hate on the rise in parts of Europe, report finds |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/anti-gay-hate-rise-parts-europe-report-finds-n1130176 |accessdate=21 October 2020 |work=NBC News |language=en}}</ref>  A 2019 survey by [[Eurobarometer]] found that more than two-thirds of LGBT people in Poland believe that prejudice against them has risen in the last five years.<ref name=survey>{{cite book|url=https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2020-lgbti-equality-1_en.pdf|title=EU LGBTI II: A long way to go for LGBTI equality|publisher=[[European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]]| isbn=978-92-9474-997-0|doi=10.2811/7746|date=2020|author1=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights}}</ref>

==Internal factions==
Law and Justice is divided into many internal factions, but they can be grouped into three main blocs.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://polskatimes.pl/frakcje-w-pis-jaroslaw-kaczynski-andrzej-duda-mateusz-morawiecki-jakie-sa-grupy-interesu-w-pis/ar/c1-12770460|title=frakcje w PiS}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fakt.pl/wydarzenia/polityka/frakcje-w-pis-kto-jest-kim-w-prawie-i-sprawiedliwosci-wewnetrzne-wojenki/890sddb|title=kto jest kim w PiSie}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polityka.pl/tygodnikpolityka/kraj/1743848,1,wojny-pisowskich-frakcji.read|title= Wojny PiSowskich frakcji}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiadomosci.onet.pl/tylko-w-onecie/wybory-2020-wojna-w-pis-czy-morawiecki-szkodzi-dudzie/fhtr8d3|title=Czy Morawiecki szkodzi Dudzie}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/pis-po-wyborach-wojna-ziobry-z-morawieckim/znj66ec|title=Wojna Ziobry z Morawieckim}}</ref>

The most influential, although not the most numerous, group within PiS is unofficially named "Order of the [[Centre Agreement]]". It is led by leader is [[Jarosław Kaczyński]], and its main members are [[Joachim Brudziński]], [[Adam Lipiński]] and [[Mariusz Błaszczak]].

The second major group is a radical, [[Christian right|religious]] and [[hard Eurosceptic]] right-wing faction focused around [[Antoni Macierewicz]], [[Beata Szydło]] and the [[United Poland]] party of [[Zbigniew Ziobro]]. This faction opts for radical reforms and is supported by [[Jacek Kurski]] and [[Tadeusz Rydzyk]].

The third major group is a Christian-democratic, republican and conservative-liberal faction focused around [[Mateusz Morawiecki]], [[Łukasz Szumowski]], [[Jacek Czaputowicz]] and the [[Agreement (political party)|Agreement]] party of [[Jarosław Gowin]]. Although not officially a party member, Polish president [[Andrzej Duda]] can also be placed in this faction.
