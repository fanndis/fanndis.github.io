Catalonia consists of four [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]]: [[Province of Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Province of Girona|Girona]], [[Province of Lleida|Lleida]], and [[Province of Tarragona|Tarragona]]. The capital and largest city, [[Barcelona]] is the second-most populated [[Municipalities in Spain|municipality]] in Spain and the fifth-most populous urban area in the [[European Union]].<ref name="demographia">[http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf Demographia: World Urban Areas] – Demographia, April 2018</ref> It comprises most of the former [[Principality of Catalonia]] (with the remainder [[Roussillon]] now part of France's [[Pyrénées-Orientales]]). It is bordered by [[France]] ([[Occitanie]]) and [[Andorra]] to the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east, and the Spanish autonomous communities of [[Aragon]] to the west and [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] to the south. The official languages are [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and the [[Aranese dialect]] of [[Occitan language|Occitan]].<ref name="estatut_langs">{{cite web|title=Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (2006), Articles 6, 50 - BOPC 224|url=http://www.parlament-cat.net/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826045656/http://www.parlament-cat.net/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf|archivedate=26 August 2013|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>

In the late 8th century, various counties across the eastern [[Pyrenees]] were established by the [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish kingdom]] as a defensive barrier against Muslim invasions. In the 10th century the County of Barcelona became progressively independent.<ref>Salrach, Josep Mª. ''Catalunya a la fi del primer mil·leni.'' Pagès Editors (Lleida, 2004), p. 144–149.</ref> In 1137, [[County of Barcelona|Barcelona]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] were united by marriage under the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Within the Crown, the Catalan counties adopted a common polity, the [[Principality of Catalonia]], developing its own institutional system, such as [[Catalan Courts|Courts]], [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Generalitat]] and [[Catalan constitutions|constitutions]], becoming the base for the Crown's Mediterranean trade and expansionism. In the later Middle Ages, [[Catalan literature]] flourished. In 1469, the [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|king]] of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and the [[Isabella I of Castile|queen]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] were married and ruled their realms together, retaining all of their distinct institutions and legislation.

During the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635–59)|Franco-Spanish War]] (1635–1659), [[Reapers' War|Catalonia revolted]] (1640–1652) against a large and burdensome presence of the royal army, being briefly proclaimed a [[Catalan Republic (1641)|republic]] under French protection, until it was largely reconquered by the Spanish army. By the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659), the [[Northern Catalonia|northern parts of Catalonia]], mostly the [[County of Roussillon|Roussillon]], were ceded to France. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714), the Crown of Aragon sided against the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[Philip V of Spain]]; following Catalan defeat on 11 September 1714, Philip V imposed a unifying administration across Spain, enacting the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] which, like in the other realms of the Crown of Aragon, suppressed the Catalan institutions and rights. This led to the eclipse of Catalan as a language of government and literature, replaced by Spanish. Throughout the 18th century, Catalonia experienced economic growth.

In the 19th century, Catalonia was severely affected by the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] and [[Carlist Wars]]. In the second third of the century, it experienced industrialisation. As wealth from the industrial expansion grew, it saw a [[Renaixença|cultural renaissance]] coupled with incipient [[Catalan nationalism|nationalism]] while several [[Workers' movement|workers movements]] appeared. With the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–1939), the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Generalitat]] was restored as a Catalan autonomous government. After the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] dictatorship enacted repressive measures, abolishing Catalan self-government and banning the official use of the Catalan language. After a period of [[autarky]], from the late 1950s through to the 1970s Catalonia saw [[Spanish miracle|rapid economic growth]], drawing many workers from across Spain, making Barcelona one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas and turning Catalonia into a major tourist destination. During the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] (1975–1982), Catalonia regained self-government and is now one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain. 

Since the 2010s there has been growing support for [[Catalan independence movement|Catalan independence]]. On 27 October 2017, the Catalan Parliament declared unilaterally independence following a [[2017 Catalan independence referendum|disputed referendum]]. The Spanish Senate voted in favour of enforcing direct rule by removing the Catalan government and calling [[2017 Catalan regional election|a snap regional election]]. The Spanish Supreme Court imprisoned seven former ministers of the Catalan government on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds, while several others—including then-President, [[Carles Puigdemont]]—fled to other European countries.

== Etymology and pronunciation ==
The name Catalonia—''Catalunya'' in Catalan, spelled ''Cathalonia'', or ''Cathalaunia'' in [[Medieval Latin]]—began to be used for the homeland of the [[Catalans]] (''Cathalanenses'') in the late 11th century and was probably used before as a territorial reference to the group of counties that comprised part of the March of Gothia and [[Marca Hispanica|March of Hispania]] under the control of the [[Count of Barcelona]] and his relatives.<ref>[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 Enciclopèdia Catalana online: Catalunya ("Geral de Cataluign, Raimundi Catalan and Arnal Catalan appear in 1107/1112")] (in Catalan) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206211826/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 |date=6 February 2012 }}</ref> The origin of the name ''Catalunya'' is subject to diverse interpretations because of a lack of evidence.

One theory suggests that ''Catalunya'' derives from the name ''Gothia'' (or ''Gauthia'') ''Launia'' ("Land of the [[Goths]]"), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, known as ''Gothia'', whence ''Gothland'' > ''Gothlandia'' > ''Gothalania'' > ''Cathalaunia'' > ''Catalonia'' theoretically derived.<ref name="Books.google.com"/><ref>{{cite book| author = Ulick Ralph Burke| title = A history of Spain from the earliest times to the death of Ferdinand the Catholic| url = https://archive.org/details/ahistoryspainfr02burkgoog| year = 1900| publisher = Longmans, Green, and co.| page = [https://archive.org/details/ahistoryspainfr02burkgoog/page/n187 154]}}</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] chroniclers claimed that ''Catalania'' derives from the local medley of [[Goths]] with [[Alans]], initially constituting a ''Goth-Alania''.<ref>The Sarmatians: 600 BC-AD 450 (Men-at-Arms) by Richard Brzezinski and Gerry Embleton, 19 August 2002.</ref>

Other less plausible or recent theories suggest:

* ''Catalunya'' derives from the term "land of castles", having evolved from the term ''castlà'' or ''castlan'', the medieval term for a [[castellan]] (a ruler of a [[castle]]).<ref name="Books.google.com">{{cite book| author = Maximiano García Venero| title = Historia del nacionalismo catalán: 2a edición| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nUABAAAAMAAJ| accessdate = 25 April 2010| date = 7 July 2006| publisher = Ed.

* The [[Lacetani]], an [[Iberians|Iberian tribe]] that lived in the area and whose name, due to the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] influence, could have evolved by [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] to ''Katelans'' and then ''Catalans''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediterranees.net/vagabondages/divers/catalogne.html |title=La Catalogne: son nom et ses limites historiques, Histoire de Roussillon |publisher=Mediterranees.net |date=22 March 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}</ref>
* Miguel Vidal, finding serious shortcomings with earlier proposals (such as that an original -''t''- would have, by normal sound laws in the local Romance languages, developed into -''d''-), suggested an Arabic etymology: ''{{transl|ar|qattāl}}'' ({{wikt-lang|ar|قتال}}, {{abbr|pl.|plural}} ''{{transl|ar|qattālūn}}'' {{lang|ar|قتالون}}) – meaning "killer" – could have been applied by Muslims to groups of raiders and bandits on the southern border of the [[Marca Hispanica]].<ref>Badia i Margarit, Antoni, 1981,

Gramàtica històrica catalana, Barcelona; see also Miguel Vidal's "Etymology of català, Catalunya", available [https://www.academia.edu/3815281/Etymology_of_català_Catalunya here].</ref> The name, originally derogatory, could have been reappropriated by Christians as an autonym. This is comparable to attested development of the term [[Almogavars|Almogavar]] in nearby areas. In this model, the name ''Catalunya'' derives from the plural ''qattālūn'' while the adjective and language name ''català'' derives from the singular ''qattāl'', both with the addition of common Romance suffixes.<ref>Sabaté, Flocel (2015).

In English, ''Catalonia'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|æ|t|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|n|i|ə}}. The native name, ''Catalunya'', is pronounced {{IPA-ca|kətəˈluɲə|}} in [[Central Catalan]], the most widely spoken variety, whose pronunciation is considered standard.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Ingo |last=Feldhausen |year=2010 |page=5 |title= Sentential Form and Prosodic Structure of Catalan|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|isbn=9789027255518}}</ref> The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name is ''Cataluña'' ({{IPA-es|kataˈluɲa|}}), and the Aranese name is ''Catalonha'' ({{IPA-oc|kataˈluɲɔ|}}).

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Cogul HBreuil.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Roca dels Moros]] contain paintings protected as part of the Rock art of the [[Iberian language|Iberian]] Mediterranean Basin, a [[World Heritage Site]]]]

The first known human settlements in what is now Catalonia were at the beginning of the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. The oldest known trace of human occupation is a mandible found in [[Banyoles]], described by some sources as pre-[[Neanderthal]] some 200,000 years old; other sources suggest it to be only about one third that old.<ref>{{citation | first1 = R | last1 = Grun | title = ESR and U-series analyses of enamel and dentine fragments of the Banyoles mandible | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | year = 2005 | url = http://www.naturalsciences.be/mars/litterature/bibliography/bibtest/Grun2005 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120904090837/http://www.naturalsciences.be/mars/litterature/bibliography/bibtest/Grun2005 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 4 September 2012 | accessdate = 31 October 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.10.001 | display-authors = etal | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 347–58 | pmid = 16364406 }}.</ref> From the next prehistoric era, the [[Epipalaeolithic]] or [[Mesolithic]], important remains survive, the greater part dated between 8000 and 5000&nbsp;BC, such as those of Sant Gregori ([[Falset, Tarragona|Falset]]) and el Filador ([[Margalef]] de Montsant). The most important sites from these eras, all excavated in the region of [[Moianès]], are the Balma del Gai (Epipaleolithic) and the Balma de l'Espluga (late Epipaleolithic and Early Neolithic).<ref>Jean Guilaine, Michel Barbaza, David Geddes, Jean-Louis Vernet, Miguel Llongueras & Maria Hopf (1982) Prehistoric Human Adaptations in Catalonia (Spain), Journal of Field Archaeology, 9:4, 407-416.</ref>

The [[Neolithic]] era began in Catalonia around 5000 BC, although the population was slower to develop fixed settlements than in other places, thanks to the abundance of woods, which allowed the continuation of a fundamentally [[hunter-gatherer]] culture. An example of such settlements would be La Draga, an "early Neolithic village which dates from the end of the 6th millennium BC."<ref>Tarrus, Josep. "La Draga (Banyoles, Catalonia), an Early Neolithic Lakeside Village in Mediterranean Europe." ''CATALAN HISTORICAL REVIEW'', vol. 1, 2008, pp. 17–33.</ref>

The [[Chalcolithic]] period developed in Catalonia between 2500 and 1800 BC, with the beginning of the construction of copper objects. The [[Bronze Age]] occurred between 1800 and 700 BC. There are few remnants of this era, but there were some known settlements in the [[Segre (river)|low Segre]] zone. The Bronze Age coincided with the arrival of the [[proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] through the [[Urnfield Culture]], whose successive waves of migration began around 1200 BC, and they were responsible for the creation of the first proto-urban settlements.<ref>[http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Pyrenae/article/viewFile/178964/242576 J. Maluquer de Motes: "Late Bronze and Early Iron in the valley of the Ebro" (''The Europea Community in Later Prehistory. Studies in honour of C. F. C. Hawkes''; Routledge & Kegan 1971, pp. 107-120)]</ref> Around the middle of the 7th century BC, the [[Iron Age]] arrived in Catalonia.

=== Pre-Roman and Roman period ===
[[File:Els Vilars — vista sud-oest 01.jpg|thumb|[[Iberian language|Iberian]] fortress [[Els Vilars]] in [[Arbeca]]]]
[[File:Tarragona.Pont del diable aqüeducte.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman aqueduct]] in [[Tarragona]] ]]
In pre-Roman times, the area that is now called Catalonia in the north-east of [[Iberian Peninsula]] – like the rest of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] side of the peninsula – was populated by the [[Iberians]]. The Iberians of this area – the [[Ilergetes]], [[Indigetes]] and [[Lacetani]] (Cerretains) – also maintained relations with the peoples of the Mediterranean. Some urban agglomerations became relevant, including Ilerda (Lleida) inland, Hibera (perhaps [[Amposta]] or [[Tortosa]]) or Indika ([[Ullastret]]). Coastal trading colonies were established by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who settled around the [[Gulf of Roses]], in Emporion ([[Empúries]]) and [[Roses, Girona|Roses]] in the [[Colonies in antiquity|8th century BC]]. The [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] briefly ruled the territory in the course of the [[Second Punic War]] and traded with [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|the surrounding Iberian population]].

After the Carthaginian defeat by the [[Roman Republic]], the north-east of Iberia became the first to come under Roman rule and became part of [[Hispania]], the westernmost part of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Tarraco (Tarragona)|Tarraco]] (modern [[Tarragona]]) was one of the most important Roman cities in Hispania and the capital of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Tarraconensis]]. Other important cities of the Roman period are Ilerda (Lleida), Dertosa (Tortosa), Gerunda (Girona) as well as the ports of Empuriæ (former Emporion) and Barcino (Barcelona). As for the rest of Hispania, [[Latin law]] was granted to all cities under the reign of [[Vespasian]] (69-79 AD), while [[Roman citizenship]] was granted to all free men of the empire by the [[Edict of Caracalla]] in 212 AD (Tarraco, the capital, was already a colony of [[Roman law]] since 45 BC). It was a rich agricultural province (olive oil, vine, [[wheat]]), and the first centuries of the Empire saw the construction of roads (the most important being the [[Via Augusta]], parallel to Mediterranean coastline) and infrastructure like [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]].

Conversion to [[Christianity]], attested in the 3rd century, was completed in urban areas in the 4th century. Although Hispania remained under Roman rule and did not fall under the rule of [[Vandals]], [[Swabians]] and [[Alans]] in the 5th century, the main cities suffered frequent sacking and some [[deurbanization]].

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the area was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] and was ruled as part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] for almost two and a half centuries. In 718, it came under [[Muslim]] control and became part of [[Al-Andalus]], a province of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. From the conquest of Roussillon in 760, to the conquest of Barcelona in 801, the [[Frankish empire]] took control of the area between Septimania and the [[Llobregat]] river from the Muslims and created heavily militarised, self-governing [[county|counties]]. These counties formed part of the historiographically known as the [[Septimania|Gothic]] and [[Spanish March|Hispanic]] marches, a [[buffer zone]] in the south of the Frankish empire in the former province of Septimania and in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, to act as a defensive barrier for the Frankish empire against further Muslim invasions from Al-Andalus.<ref>Ramos, Luis G-G (2002).

These counties came under the rule of the [[counts of Barcelona]], who were Frankish [[vassal]]s nominated by the emperor of the Franks, to whom they were [[feudatory|feudatories]] (801–988). The earliest known use of the name "[[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]]" for these counties dates to 1117. At the end of the 9th century, the Count of Barcelona [[Wilfred the Hairy]] made his title hereditary and founded the dynasty of the [[House of Barcelona]], which ruled Catalonia until 1410.

In 988 [[Borrell II]], Count of Barcelona, did not recognise the new French king [[Hugh Capet]] as his king, evidencing the loss of dependency from Frankish rule and confirming his successors (from [[Ramon Borrell, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Borrell I]] to Ramon Berenguer IV) as independent of the Capetian crown whom they regarded as usurpers of the Carolingian Frankish realm.<ref>Salrach Josep Mª. ''Catalunya a la fi del primer mil·leni.'' Pagès Editors, (Lleida, 2004) p. 144–49.</ref> At the beginning of eleventh century the Catalan counties suffered an important process of feudalisation, partially controlled by the church's sponsored [[Peace and Truce of God|Peace and Truce Assemblies]] and by the negotiation skills of the Count of Barcelona [[Ramon Berenguer I]], which began the codification of feudal law in the written [[Usages of Barcelona]], becoming the basis of the Catalan law. In 1137, [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]] decided to accept [[Ramiro II of Aragon|King Ramiro II of Aragon]]'s proposal to marry Queen [[Petronilla of Aragon|Petronila]], establishing the dynastic union of the County of Barcelona with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], creating the [[Crown of Aragon]] and making the Catalan counties that were united under the county of Barcelona into a [[principality]] of the Aragonese Crown.

In 1258, by means of the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]], [[James I of Aragon]] King of Aragon and [[Count of Barcelona]], king of Mallorca and of Valencia, renounced his family rights and dominions in [[Occitania]] and recognised the king of France as heir of the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian Dynasty]]. The king of France, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], formally relinquished his claims of feudal lordship over all the Catalan counties, except the [[County of Foix]], despite the opposition of the king of Aragon and count of Barcelona.<ref name="Petit-Dutaillis2013">{{cite book|author=C.

As a coastal territory, Catalonia became the base of the Aragonese Crown's maritime forces, which spread the power of the Aragonese Crown in the Mediterranean, and made Barcelona into a powerful and wealthy city. In the period of 1164–1410, new territories, the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], the [[Kingdom of Majorca]], [[Sardinia]], the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], [[Corsica]], and, briefly, the [[Duchy|Duchies]] of [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] and [[Duchy of Neopatras|Neopatras]], were incorporated into the dynastic domains of the [[House of Aragon]]. The expansion was accompanied by a great development of the Catalan trade, creating an extensive trade network across the Mediterranean which competed with those of the maritime republics of [[Genoa Republic|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]].

At the same time, the [[Principality of Catalonia]] developed a complex institutional and political system based in the concept of a pact between the [[estates of the realm]] and the king. Laws had to be approved in the [[Catalan Courts|General Court of Catalonia]], one of the first parliamentary bodies of Europe that banned the royal power to create legislation unilaterally (since 1283).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://usuarios.multimania.es/maarian/Catalunya/historiacataluna/las_cortes_catalanas_.htm |title=Las Cortes Catalanas y la primera Generalidad medieval (s.

[[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], the grandson of Ferdinand I, and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] were married in 1469, later taking the title the [[Catholic Monarchs]]; subsequently, this event was seen by historiographers as the dawn of a unified Spain. At this time, though united by marriage, the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] maintained distinct territories, each keeping its own traditional institutions, parliaments, laws and currency.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Imperial Spain 1469-1716|last=Huxtable|first=Elliott, J.

Over the next few centuries, the Principality of Catalonia was generally on the losing side of a series of wars that led steadily to an increased centralization of power in Spain. Despite this fact, between the 16th and 18th centuries, the participation of the political community in the local and the general Catalan government grew, while the kings remained absent and its constitutional system continued to consolidate. Tensions between Catalan institutions and the Monarchy began to arise. The large and burdensome presence of the Spanish royal army in the Principality due to the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659)|Franco-Spanish War]] led to an uprising of peasants, provoking the [[Reapers' War]] (1640–1652), which saw Catalonia rebel (briefly as a [[Catalan Republic (1641)|republic]] led by the chairman of the Generalitat, [[Pau Claris]]) with French help against the Spanish Crown for overstepping Catalonia's rights during the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref>Gelderen, Martin van; Skinner, Quentin (2002).

The most significant conflict concerning the governing monarchy was the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which began when the childless [[Charles II of Spain]], the last Spanish Habsburg, died without an heir in 1700. Charles II had chosen [[Philip V of Spain]] from the French [[House of Bourbon]]. Catalonia, like other territories that formed the Crown of Aragon, rose up in support of the Austrian Habsburg pretender [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], in his claim for the Spanish throne as Charles III of Spain. The fight between the houses of Bourbon and Habsburg for the Spanish Crown split Spain and Europe.

The [[Siege of Barcelona (1713–14)|fall of Barcelona]] on 11 September 1714 to the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] king [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] militarily ended the Habsburg claim to the Spanish Crown, which became legal fact in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Philip felt that he had been betrayed by the Catalan Courts, as it had initially sworn its loyalty to him when he had presided over it in 1701. In retaliation for the betrayal, and inspired by the French [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] style of government, the first Bourbon king introduced the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], that incorporated the lands of the Crown of Aragon, including the Principality of Catalonia, as provinces under the Crown of Castile in 1716, terminating their separate institutions, laws and rights, as well as their {{not a typo|pactist}} politics, within a united kingdom of Spain.<ref>Mercader, J. ''Felip V i Catalunya''. (Barcelona, 1968)</ref> From the second third of 18th century onwards Catalonia carried out a successful process of [[proto-industrialization]], reinforced in the late quarter of the century when Castile's trade monopoly with American colonies ended.

=== Industrialisation, Republic and autonomy ===
[[File:Cesar Alvarez Dumont - El Gran dia de Girona.jpg|thumb|[[Third Siege of Girona]] (1809), [[Peninsular War]] against Napoleon]]

At the beginning of the nineteenth, century Catalonia was severely affected by the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1808, it was occupied by French troops; the resistance against the occupation eventually developed into the [[Peninsular War]]. The rejection to French dominion was institutionalized with the creation of "juntas" (councils) who, remaining loyal to the Bourbons, exercised the sovereignty and representation of the territory due to the disappearance of the old institutions. Napoleon took direct control of Catalonia to establish order, creating the Government of Catalonia under the rule of [[Marshall Augereau]], and making Catalan briefly an official language again. Between 1812 and 1814, Catalonia was annexed to France and organized as four [[French departments of Spain|départements]].<ref>''[http://www.histoire-empire.org/departements/france_modifications.htm Les modifications intérieures de la France]''</ref> The French troops evacuated Catalan territory at the end of 1814. After the Bourbon restoration in Spain and the death of the absolutist king [[Ferdinand VII]], [[Carlist Wars]] erupted against the new born [[Liberalism|liberal state]] of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]]. Catalonia was divided, the coast and most industrialized areas support liberalism, while many inland areas were in the hands of [[Carlism|Carlists]], as the last ones proposed to reestablish the institutional systems suppressed in the Nueva Planta decrees in all the ancient realms of the Crown of Aragon.

[[File:Semana tragica.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration after the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]], 1909]]
In the second third of the 19th century, it became an industrial center. This process was boosted by, amongst other things, national {{ill|protectionist laws|es|Ley de Relaciones Comerciales con las Antillas|vertical-align=sup}} (although the policy of the Spanish government during those times changed many times between free trade and protectionism) and the conditions of proto-industrialization of the prior two centuries of the Catalan urban areas and its countryside. Along the century, textile industry flourished in urban areas and in the countryside, usually in the form of [[company towns]]. To this day it remains one of the most industrialised areas of Spain. In 1832 it was inaugurated in Barcelona the factory Bonaplata, the first of the country which worked with [[steam engine]]. During those years, Barcelona was the focus of important revolutionary uprisings, called "bullangues", causing a difficult relation between many sectors of Catalan society and the central government and, in Catalonia, a [[republicanism|republican]] current began to develop; also, inevitably, many Catalans favored a more federal Spain. Meanwhile, the Catalan language saw a cultural renaissance (the ''[[Renaixença]]'') at popular and bourgeois level. After the fall of the [[First Spanish Republic]] and the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty (1874), Catalan nationalism grew in importance.

In the first third of the 20th century, Catalonia gained and lost varying degrees of autonomy several times. In 1914, the four Catalan provinces were authorized to create a [[Commonwealth of Catalonia|Commonwealth]] (Catalan: ''Mancomunitat de Catalunya''), without any legislative power or specific autonomy which carried out an ambitious program of modernization, but it was disbanded in 1925 by the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] (1923-1930).

The governments of the Republican Generalitat, led by the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC) members Francesc Macià (1931-1933) and [[Lluís Companys]] (1933-1940) made efforts to implement an advanced and progressive social agenda, despite the internal difficulties. This period was marked by political unrest, the effects of the economic crisis and their social repercussions. The Statute of Autonomy was suspended in 1934, due to the [[Events of 6 October]] in Barcelona, as a response{{clarify|date=January 2019}} to the accession of right-wing Spanish nationalist party [[CEDA]] to the government of the Republic, considered close to [[fascism]].<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Finestres| first1=Jordi| last2=López| first2=Manel| title = Entre la revolució i l'estelada| journal=Sàpiens| year=2014| location=Barcelona| language=Catalan| issn=1695-2014|pages=31–32}}</ref>

The defeat of the [[July 1936 military uprising in Barcelona|military rebellion against the Republican government in Barcelona]] placed Catalonia firmly in the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican side]] of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During the war, there were two rival powers in Catalonia: the de jure power of the Generalitat and the de facto power of the armed popular militias.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Spanish Civil war: Revolution and counter-revolution. |last=Bolloten |first=Burnett |authorlink=Burnett Bolloten |year=1991 |publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]] |pages=388–389}}</ref> Violent confrontations between the workers' parties ([[CNT-FAI]] and [[Workers Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] against the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia|PSUC]]) culminated in the defeat of the first ones in 1937. The situation resolved itself progressively in favor of the Generalitat, but at the same time the Generalitat was partially losing its autonomous power within Republican Spain. In 1938 Franco's troops broke the Republican territory in two, isolating Catalonia from the rest of the Republic. The defeat of the Republican army in the [[Battle of the Ebro]] led in 1938 and 1939 to the occupation of Catalonia by Franco's forces.

The defeat of the Spanish Republic in the [[Spanish Civil War]] brought to power the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]], whose first ten-year rule was particularly violent, autocratic, and repressive both in a political, cultural, social, and economical sense.<ref>Payne, Stanley Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977, pp. 476–477 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin Press</ref> In Catalonia, any kind of public activities associated with [[Catalan nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[anarchism]], [[socialism]], [[liberalism]], [[democracy]] or [[communism]], including the publication of books on those subjects or simply discussion of them in open meetings, was banned. [[File:FrancoenReus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Francisco Franco]] in [[Reus]], 1940]] Franco's regime banned the use of Catalan in government-run institutions and during public events, and also the Catalan institutions of self-government were abolished. The pro-Republic of Spain president of Catalonia, [[Lluís Companys]], was taken to Spain from his exile in the German-occupied France, and was tortured and executed in the [[Montjuïc Castle (Barcelona)|Montjuïc Castle]] of Barcelona for the crime of 'military rebellion'.<ref>Preston, Paul. (2012). ''The Spanish Holocaust''. Harper Press. London p. 493</ref>

During later stages of [[Francoist Spain]], certain folkloric and religious celebrations in Catalan resumed and were tolerated. Use of Catalan in the [[mass media]] had been forbidden, but was permitted from the early 1950s<ref>{{cite book| author = Ross| title = Cultural Contestation in Ethnic Conflict| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Oe4popSDfW0C&pg=PA139| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-1-139-46307-2| page = 139 | date = 3 May 2007}}</ref> in the theatre.

The years after the war were extremely hard. Catalonia, like many other parts of Spain, had been devastated by the war. Recovery from the war damage was slow and made more difficult by the international trade embargo and the [[Autarky|autarkic]] politics of Franco's regime. By the late 1950s the region had recovered its pre-war economic levels and in the 1960s was the second fastest growing economy in the world in what became known as the [[Spanish miracle]]. During this period there was a spectacular growth of industry and tourism in Catalonia that drew large numbers of workers to the region from across Spain and made the area around Barcelona into one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas.

=== Transition and democratic period (1975–present) ===

[[File:Barcelona AUGUST 1992 the Olympic Games (Juegos Olímpicos de Barcelona 1992) - panoramio.jpg|thumb|200px|The Olympic flame in the [[Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys|Olympic Stadium Lluís Companys]] of [[Barcelona]] during the [[1992 Summer Olympics]]]]
After Franco's death in 1975, Catalonia voted for the adoption of a democratic Spanish Constitution in 1978, in which Catalonia recovered political and cultural autonomy, restoring the Generalitat (exiled since the end of the Civil War in 1939) in 1977 and adopting a [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979|new Statute of Autonomy]] in 1979. [[1980 Catalan regional election|First election]] to the Parliament of Catalonia under this Statute gave the Catalan presidency to [[Jordi Pujol]], a position he would hold until 2003. During this time, he also led [[Convergence and Unity|Convergència i Unió]] (CiU), a center-right Catalan nationalist electoral coalition. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the institutions of Catalan autonomy continued to develop, among them an autonomous police force (''[[Mossos d'Esquadra]]'', in 1983),<ref>[https://mossos.gencat.cat/ca/els_mossos_desquadra/historia_de_la_pg-me/ History of the Mossos d'Esquadra] mossos.gencat.cat</ref> and the broadcasting network [[Televisió de Catalunya]] and its first channel [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], created in 1983.<ref>[http://www.ccma.cat/corporatiu/en/historia/ History of Televisió de Catalunya] ccma.cat</ref> Today, Catalonia is one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain. The Catalan capital and largest city, Barcelona, is a major international cultural centre and a major tourist destination. In 1992, [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona hosted]] the [[Summer Olympic Games]].

In November 2003, elections to the Parliament of Catalonia gave the government to a left-wing catalanist coalition formed by the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia]] (PSC-PSOE), [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC) and [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens]] (ICV), and the socialist [[Pasqual Maragall]] was appointed president. The new government redacted a [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia|new version of the Statute of Autonomy]], which consolidated and extended certain aspects of self-government.

The new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, approved after a referendum in 2006, was contested by important sectors of the Spanish society, especially by the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], which sent the law to the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]]. In 2010, the Court declared non-valid some of the articles that established an autonomous Catalan system of Justice, improved aspects of the financing, a new territorial division, the status of Catalan language or the symbolical declaration of Catalonia as a nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/3748884/20100629/sentencia-lestatut-obre-nova-era-politica-catalunya.html|title=Anàlisi de les retallades a l'estatut de Catalunya|last=associats|first=Partal, Maresma i|access-date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913152842/http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/3748884/20100629/sentencia-lestatut-obre-nova-era-politica-catalunya.html|archive-date=13 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> This decision was severely contested by large sectors of Catalan society, which increased the demands of independence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ara.cat/especials/gentada-centre-Barcelona-mitja-manifestacio_0_772122901.html|title=Un milió i mig de manifestants per la independència de Catalunya|access-date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918025513/http://www.ara.cat/especials/gentada-centre-Barcelona-mitja-manifestacio_0_772122901.html|archive-date=18 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The climate of Catalonia is diverse. The populated areas lying by the coast in Tarragona, Barcelona and Girona provinces feature a [[Hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''). The inland part (including the Lleida province and the inner part of Barcelona province) show a mostly [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''). The Pyrenean peaks have a [[continental climate|continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''D'') or even [[Alpine climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''ET'') at the highest summits, while the valleys have a maritime or [[oceanic climate]] sub-type ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'').

In the Mediterranean area, summers are dry and hot with sea breezes, and the maximum temperature is around {{convert|26|-|31|°C}}. Winter is cool or slightly cold depending on the location. It snows frequently in the Pyrenees, and it occasionally snows at lower altitudes, even by the coastline. Spring and autumn are typically the rainiest seasons, except for the Pyrenean valleys, where summer is typically stormy.

The inland part of Catalonia is hotter and drier in summer. Temperature may reach {{convert|35|°C}}, some days even {{convert|40|°C}}. Nights are cooler there than at the coast, with the temperature of around {{convert|14|-|17|°C}}. Fog is not uncommon in valleys and plains; it can be especially persistent, with [[freezing drizzle]] episodes and subzero temperatures during winter, mainly along the [[Ebro]] and [[Segre River|Segre]] valleys and in [[Plain of Vic]].

[[File:Beciberri.JPG|thumb|left|[[Besiberri]] in Catalan [[Pyrenees]] ]]
Catalonia has a marked geographical diversity, considering the relatively small size of its territory. The [[geography]] is conditioned by the Mediterranean coast, with {{convert|580|km|mi|abbr=off}} of coastline, and large relief units of the Pyrenees to the north. The Catalan territory is divided into three main geomorphological units:<ref>{{cite web|title=Geological map of Catalonia|url=http://www.icgc.cat/en/Public-Administration-and-Enterprises/Downloads/Geological-and-geothematic-cartography/Geological-mapping/Geological-map-of-Catalonia-1-50.000|publisher=Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya|accessdate=11 October 2017|date=2016}}</ref>

* The Pyrenees: mountainous formation that connects the Iberian Peninsula with the [[Continental Europe|European continental territory]], and located in the north of Catalonia;
* The Catalan Coastal mountain ranges or the Catalan Mediterranean System: an alternating delevacions and planes parallel to the Mediterranean coast;
* The [[Catalan Central Depression]]: structural unit which forms the eastern sector of the Valley of the Ebro.

[[File:2012 Montserrat.jpg|thumb|left|Mountain of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] and the [[Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey|monastery]]]]
The Catalan Pyrenees represent almost half in length of the Pyrenees, as it extends more than {{convert|200|km|abbr=off}}. Traditionally differentiated the Axial Pyrenees (the main part) and the [[Pre-Pyrenees]] (southern from the Axial) which are mountainous formations parallel to the main mountain ranges but with lower altitudes, less steep and a different geological formation. The highest mountain of Catalonia, located north of the comarca of Pallars Sobirà is the Pica d'Estats (3,143&nbsp;m), followed by the Puigpedrós (2,914&nbsp;m). The [[Serra del Cadí]] comprises the highest peaks in the Pre-Pyrenees and forms the southern boundary of the [[Cerdanya]] valley.

The Central Catalan Depression is a plain located between the Pyrenees and Pre-Coastal Mountains. Elevation ranges from {{convert|200|to|600|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The plains and the water that descend from the Pyrenees have made it fertile territory for [[agriculture]] and numerous irrigation canals have been built. Another major plain is the [[Empordà]], located in the northeast.

The Catalan Mediterranean system is based on two ranges running roughly parallel to the coast (southwest–northeast), called the Coastal and the Pre-Coastal Ranges. The Coastal Range is both the shorter and the lower of the two, while the Pre-Coastal is greater in both length and elevation. Areas within the Pre-Coastal Range include [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]], [[Montseny Massif|Montseny]] and the [[Ports de Tortosa-Beseit]]. Lowlands alternate with the Costal and Pre-Costal Ranges. The Coastal Lowland is located to the East of the Coastal Range between it and the coast, while the Pre-Coastal Lowlands are located inland, between the Costal and Pre-Costal Ranges, and includes the [[Vallès]] and [[Penedès]] plains.

=== Flora and fauna ===
[[File:BennyTrapp Montseny-Gebirgsmolch Calotriton arnoldi Montseny-Gebirge Spanien.jpg|thumb|Montseny brook newt (''[[Calotriton arnoldi]]''), [[endemic]] to the [[Montseny Massif]]]]
Catalonia is a showcase of European [[landscapes]] on a small scale. Just over {{convert|30000|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} hosting a variety of substrates, soils, climates, directions, altitudes and distances to the sea. The area is of great ecological diversity and a remarkable wealth of landscapes, habitats and species.

The fauna of Catalonia comprises a minority of animals endemic to the region and a majority of non-native animals. Much of Catalonia enjoys a Mediterranean climate (except mountain areas), which makes many of the animals that live there adapted to Mediterranean ecosystems. Of mammals, there are plentiful [[wild boar]], red foxes, as well as [[roe deer]] and in the Pyrenees, the [[Pyrenean chamois]]. Other large species such as the [[bear]] have been recently reintroduced.

Waters of [[Balearic Sea]] are rich in biodiversity, and even the [[megafauna]]s of ocean; various type of whales (such as [[fin whale|fin]], [[sperm whale|sperm]], and [[long-finned pilot whale|pilot]]) and [[dolphin]]s live within the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmaktub.org/en/home-2/|title=EDMAKTUB I Estudio de cetáceos|website=www.edmaktub.org}}</ref><ref>Casinos A.

=== Hydrography ===
{{See also|List of rivers of Catalonia}}
[[File:Aerea estany de banyoles.png|thumb|[[Lake of Banyoles]] ]]
[[File:Tossa de Mar Buchten 1.JPG|thumb|[[Tossa de Mar]], Costa Brava]]
Most of Catalonia belongs to the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. The Catalan hydrographic network consists of two important basins, the one of the [[Ebro]] and the one that comprises the internal basins of Catalonia (respectively covering 46.84% and 51.43% of the territory), all of them flow to the [[Mediterranean]]. Furthermore, there is the [[Garona]] river basin that flows to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], but it only covers 1.73% of the Catalan territory.

The hydrographic network can be divided in two sectors, an occidental slope or Ebro river slope and one oriental slope constituted by minor rivers that flow to the Mediterranean along the Catalan coast. The first slope provides an average of {{convert|18700|hm3|cumi|lk=on|abbr=off}} per year, while the second only provides an average of {{convert|2020|hm3|cumi|abbr=on}}/year. The difference is due to the big contribution of the Ebro river, from which the [[Segre (river)|Segre]] is an important tributary. Moreover, in Catalonia there is a relative wealth of groundwaters, although there is inequality between ''[[comarca|comarques]]'', given the complex geological structure of the territory.<ref name="GEC clima">{{cite web |url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclop%C3%A8dies/gran-enciclop%C3%A8dia-catalana/EC-GEC-0016439.xml |title=Catalunya: El clima i la hidrografia |language=Catalan|work=l'Enciclopèdia |location=Barcelona |editor=Gran Enciclopedia Catalana}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> In the Pyrenees there are many small lakes, remnants of the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]]. The biggest are the [[lake of Banyoles]] and the recently recovered [[lake of Ivars]].

The Catalan coast is almost rectilinear, with a length of {{convert|580|km}} and few [[landform]]s—the most relevant are the [[Cap de Creus]] and the [[Gulf of Roses]] to the north and the [[Ebro Delta]] to the south. The [[Catalan Coastal Range]] hugs the coastline, and it is split into two segments, one between [[L'Estartit]] and the town of [[Blanes]] (the [[Costa Brava]]), and the other at the south, at the Costes del [[Garraf]].

The principal [[List of rivers of Catalonia|rivers in Catalonia]] are the [[Ter (river)|Ter]], [[Llobregat]], and the [[Ebro]] (Catalan: {{lang|ca|Ebre}}), all of which run into the [[Mediterranean]].

===Anthropic pressure and protection of nature===
The majority of Catalan population is concentrated in 30% of the territory, mainly in the coastal plains. Intensive agriculture, livestock farming and industrial activities have been accompanied by a massive [[Mass tourism|tourist]] influx (more than 20&nbsp;million annual visitors), a rate of urbanization and even of major metropolisation which has led to a strong urban sprawl: two thirds of Catalans live in the urban area of Barcelona, while the proportion of urban land increased from 4.2% in 1993 to 6.2% in 2009, a growth of 48.6% in sixteen years, complemented with a dense network of transport infrastructure. This is accompanied by a certain agricultural abandonment (decrease of 15% of all areas cultivated in Catalonia between 1993 and 2009) and a global threat to [[natural environment]]. Human activities have also put some animal species at risk, or even led to their disappearance from the territory, like the [[gray wolf]] and probably the [[brown bear]] of the Pyrenees. The pressure created by this model of life means that the country's [[ecological footprint]] exceeds its administrative area.<ref>{{in lang|ca}} [http://www.gencat.cat/mediamb/publicacions/monografies/bd_conservacio/bd_catalunya_ca_basic.pdf ''Biodiversitat a Catalunya'', Generalitat de Catalunya] Retrieved 29 July 2017.</ref>

Faced with this problems, Catalan authorities initiated several measures whose purpose is to protect natural ecosystems. Thus, in 1990, the Catalan government created the Nature Conservation Council (Catalan: {{lang|ca|Consell de Protecció de la Natura}}), an advisory body with the aim to study, protect and manage the natural environments and landscapes of Catalonia. In addition, the Generalitat has carried out the Plan of Spaces of Natural Interest ({{lang|ca|Pla d'Espais d'Interès Natural}} or PEIN) in 1992 while eighteen Natural Spaces of Special Protection ({{lang|ca|Espais Naturals de Protecció Especial}} or ENPE) have been instituted.

There's a [[National Park]], [[Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park|Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici]]; fourteen [[Natural park (Spain)|Natural Parks]], [[Alt Pirineu Natural Park|Alt Pirineu]], Aiguamolls de l'Empordà, [[Cadí-Moixeró Natural Park|Cadí-Moixeró]], [[Cap de Creus]], Sources of Ter and Freser, [[Collserola]], [[Ebro Delta]], [[Ports de Tortosa-Beseit|Ports]], [[Montgrí, Medes Islands and Baix Ter Natural Park|Montgrí, Medes Islands and Baix Ter]], [[Montseny Massif|Montseny]], [[Montserrat]], Sant Llorenç del Munt and l'Obac, [[Serra de Montsant]] and the [[Garrotxa Volcanic Zone Natural Park|Garrotxa Volcanic Zone]]; as well as three Natural Places of National Interest ({{lang|ca|Paratge Natural d'Interes Nacional}} or PNIN), the [[Pedraforca]], the [[Poblet Monastery|Poblet]] Forest and the [[Albères]].

Two major factors were [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Spain's Constitutional Court's]] 2010 decision to declare part of the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia unconstitutional, as well as the fact that Catalonia contributes 19.49% of the central government's tax revenue, but only receives 14.03% of central government's spending.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Abend |first=Lisa |title=Spain Barcelona Warns Madrid: Pay Up, or Catalonia Leaves Spain |url=http://world.time.com/2012/09/11/barcelona-warns-madrid-pay-up-or-catalonia-leaves-spain/?xid=newsletter-weekly |magazine=TIME |accessdate=17 September 2012 |date=11 September 2012}}</ref>

Parties that consider themselves either Catalan nationalist or [[Catalan independence|independentist]] have been present in all Catalan governments since 1980. The largest Catalan nationalist party, [[Convergence and Union]], ruled Catalonia from 1980 to 2003, and returned to power in the [[2010 Catalan regional election|2010 election]]. Between 2003 and 2010, a leftist coalition, composed by the [[Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya|Catalan Socialists' Party]], the pro-independence [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] and the leftist-environmentalist [[Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds|Initiative for Catalonia-Greens]], implemented policies that widened Catalan autonomy.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In the [[2012 Catalonian parliamentary election|25 November 2012 Catalan parliamentary election]], sovereigntist parties supporting a secession referendum gathered 59.01% of the votes and held 87 of the 135 seats in the Catalan Parliament. Parties supporting independence from the rest of Spain obtained 49.12% of the votes and a majority of 74 seats.

[[Artur Mas]], then the president of Catalonia, organised early elections that took place on 27 September 2015. In these elections, Convergència and Esquerra Republicana decided to join, and they presented themselves under the coalition named "Junts pel Sí" (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], "[[Together for Yes]]"). "Junts pel Sí" won 62 seats and was the most voted party, and CUP ([[Candidatura d'Unitat Popular]], a far-left and independentist party) won another 10, so the sum of all the independentist forces/parties was 72 seats, reaching an absolute majority, but not in number of individual votes, comprising 47,74% of the total.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://resultats.parlament2015.cat/09AU/DAU09999CM_L4.htm |title=Resultats provisionals 27S |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=gencat.cat |publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya |access-date=29 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930003326/http://resultats.parlament2015.cat/09AU/DAU09999CM_L4.htm |archivedate=30 September 2015 }}</ref>

=== Statute of Autonomy ===
{{Main|Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia}}
{{See also|Autonomous communities of Spain|Nationalities and regions of Spain}}
[[File:Estatuto de Nuria.jpg|thumb|The first [[Statute of Catalonia]], 1932]]
The [[Statute of Autonomy]] of Catalonia is the fundamental organic law, second only to the Spanish Constitution from which the Statute originates.

In the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] Catalonia, along with the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], was defined as a "[[nationalities and regions of Spain|nationality]]". The same constitution gave Catalonia the automatic right to autonomy, which resulted in the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979]].

Both the 1979 Statute of Autonomy and the current one, approved in 2006, state that "Catalonia, as a nationality, exercises its self-government constituted as an Autonomous Community in accordance with the Constitution and with the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, which is its basic institutional law, always under the law in Spain".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a1 |title=First article of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalunya |publisher=Gencat.net |accessdate=25 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113100832/http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a1 |archivedate=13 January 2009 }}</ref>

The Preamble of the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia states that the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] has defined Catalonia as a [[nation]], but that "the Spanish Constitution recognizes Catalonia's national reality as a nationality".<ref>[http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/castellano/titulo_preliminar.html Constitución Española, Título Preliminar]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013022212/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/castellano/titulo_preliminar.html |date=13 October 2007 }}</ref> While the Statute was approved by and sanctioned by both the Catalan and Spanish parliaments, and later by referendum in Catalonia, it has been subject to a legal challenge by the surrounding autonomous communities of [[Aragon]], [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Valencian Community|Valencia]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Europa Press/Madrid |url=http://www.hoy.es/prensa/20061115/nacional/admitidos-recursos-aragon-valencia_20061115.html |title=Admitidos los recursos de Aragón, Valencia y Baleares contra el Estatuto catalán. |publisher=Hoy.es |date=1 December 1997 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> as well as by the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]]. The objections are based on various issues such as disputed [[cultural heritage]] but, especially, on the Statute's alleged breaches of the principle of "solidarity between regions" in fiscal and educational matters enshrined by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution]].<ref>{{cite news |author=El País |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/anos/encarnizada/batalla/politica/elpepuesp/20100416elpepunac_26/Tes |title=Cuatro años de encarnizada batalla política. |newspaper=El País |date=29 June 2010 |accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref>

Spain's [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Constitutional Court]] assessed the disputed articles and on 28 June 2010, issued its judgment on the principal allegation of unconstitutionality presented by the People's Party in 2006. The judgment granted clear passage to 182 articles of the 223 that make up the fundamental text. The court approved 73 of the 114 articles that the People's Party had contested, while declaring 14 articles unconstitutional in whole or in part and imposing a restrictive interpretation on 27 others.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/retoque/74/articulos/recurridos/elpepunac/20100629elpepinac_4/Tes |title=Ni un retoque en 74 artículos recurridos |newspaper=El País |accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref> The court accepted the specific provision that described Catalonia as a "nation", however ruled that it was a historical and cultural term with no legal weight, and that Spain remained the only nation recognised by the constitution.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/news/Catalonia-39is-not-a-nation39.6412380.jp |title=Catalonia 'is not a nation' 10 July 2010 |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= 10 July 2010|accessdate=6 January 2011 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matthewbennett.es/60/is-catalonia-a-nation-or-a-nationality-or-is-spain-the-only-nation-in-spain/ |title=Is Catalonia a nation or a nationality, or is Spain the only nation in Spain? |publisher=Matthewbennett.es |accessdate=6 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908023751/http://www.matthewbennett.es/60/is-catalonia-a-nation-or-a-nationality-or-is-spain-the-only-nation-in-spain/ |archivedate=8 September 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Fiona Govan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/7861118/Catalonia-can-call-itself-a-nation-rules-Spains-top-court.html |title=Catalonia can call itself a 'nation', rules Spain's top court 29 Jun 2010 |work=Telegraph|date=29 June 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2011 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16490065 |title=A nationality, not a nation Jul 1st 2010 |work=Economist|date= 1 July 2010|accessdate=6 January 2011}}</ref>

=== Government and law ===
{{Main|Generalitat of Catalonia}}
[[File:Parliament of Catalunya.JPG|thumb|left|[[Parliament of Catalonia]], located in [[Ciutadella park]], Barcelona]]
The Catalan Statute of Autonomy establishes that Catalonia is organised politically through the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] (in Catalan: {{lang|ca|Generalitat de Catalunya}}), conformed by the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Parliament]], the Presidency of the Generalitat, the [[Government of Catalonia|Government]] or Executive Council and the other institutions created by the Parliament, among them the Ombudsman ({{lang|ca|[[Síndic de Greuges (Catalonia)|Síndic de Greuges]]}}), the Office of Auditors ({{lang|ca|Sindicatura de Comptes}}) or the Council for Statutory Guarantees ({{lang|ca|Consell de Garanties Estatutàries}})

==== Legislature ====
The Parliament of Catalonia (in Catalan: {{lang|ca|Parlament de Catalunya}}) is the legislative body of the Generalitat and represents the citizens of Catalonia. It is elected every four years by [[universal suffrage]], and it has powers to legislate in different matters such as education, health, culture, internal institutional and territorial organization, election and control of the president of the Generalitat and the Government, budget and other affairs, according with the Statute of Autonomy. The last Catalan election was held on 21 December 2017, and its current president is [[Roger Torrent]], incumbent since January 2018.

==== Presidency ====
The [[president of the Generalitat of Catalonia]] (in Catalan: {{lang|ca|president de la Generalitat de Catalunya}}) is the highest representative of Catalonia, and is also responsible of leading the government's action. Since the restoration of the Generalitat on the return of democracy in Spain, the [[List of Presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya|presidents of Catalonia]] have been [[Josep Tarradellas]] (1977–1980, president in exile since 1954), [[Jordi Pujol]] (1980–2003), [[Pasqual Maragall]] (2003–2006), [[José Montilla]] (2006–2010), [[Artur Mas]] (2010–2016), [[Carles Puigdemont]] (2016&ndash;2017) and, after the imposition of direct rule from Madrid, [[Quim Torra]] (2018–).

==== Executive ====
The [[Executive Council of Catalonia|Executive Council]] (in Catalan: {{lang|ca|Consell Executiu}}) or Government ({{lang|ca|Govern}}), is the body responsible of the government of the Generalitat, it holds executive and regulatory power. It comprises the president of the Generalitat, the [[List of First Ministers of Catalonia|First Minister]] (or the [[List of Vice Presidents of Catalonia|Vice President]]) and the Ministers ({{lang|ca|consellers}}). Its seat is the [[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya|Palau de la Generalitat]], in Barcelona.

=== Security forces and Justice ===
{{Main|Mossos d'Esquadra}}
Catalonia has its own police force, the {{lang|ca|[[Mossos d'Esquadra]]}} (officially called {{lang|ca|Mossos d'Esquadra-Policia de la Generalitat de Catalunya}}), whose origins date back to the 18th century. Since 1980 they have been under the command of the Generalitat, and since 1994 they have expanded in number in order to replace the national [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] and [[National Police Corps]], which report directly to the Homeland Department of Spain. The national bodies retain personnel within Catalonia to exercise functions of national scope such as overseeing ports, airports, coasts, international borders, custom offices, the identification of documents and arms control, immigration control, terrorism prevention, arms trafficking prevention, amongst others.

Most of the justice system is administered by national judicial institutions, the highest body and last judicial instance in the Catalan jurisdiction, integrating the Spanish judiciary, is the [[High Court of Justice of Catalonia]]. The [[criminal justice]] system is uniform throughout Spain, while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] is administered separately within Catalonia. The civil laws that are subject to autonomous legislation have been codified in the [[Civil Code of Catalonia]] ({{lang|ca|Codi civil de Catalunya}}) since 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://civil.udg.es/normacivil/catalunya.htm |title=Legislació civil catalana |publisher=Civil.udg.es |date=20 July 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706215412/http://civil.udg.es/normacivil/catalunya.htm |archive-date=6 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Navarre]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and Catalonia are the Spanish communities with the highest degree of autonomy in terms of [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement]].

=== Administrative divisions ===
[[File:CatMCVPtoponims.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|Administrative divisions of Catalonia]]

Catalonia is organised territorially into [[province]]s, further subdivided into [[comarca|comarques]] and [[municipality|municipalities]]. The 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia establishes the administrative organisation of three local authorities: [[vegueria|vegueries]], comarques, and municipalities.

==== Provinces ====
{{Further|Provinces of Spain}}
Catalonia is divided administratively into four provinces, the governing body of which is the Provincial Deputation ({{lang-ca|Diputació Provincial|links=no}}, {{lang-es|Diputación Provincial|links=no}}). The four provinces and their populations are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idescat.cat/territ/BasicTerr?TC=5&V0=5&V1=08&V3=863&V4=435&ALLINFO=TRUE&PARENT=1&GERMANS=TRUE&CTX=B |title=Padró municipal d'habitants.

* [[Province of Barcelona]]: 5,507,813 population
* [[Province of Girona]]: 752,026 population
* [[Province of Lleida]]: 439,253 population
* [[Province of Tarragona]]: 805,789 population

==== Comarques ====
{{Main|Comarques of Catalonia}}
Comarques (singular: "comarca") are entities composed by the municipalities to manage their responsibilities and services. The current regional division has its roots in a decree of the Generalitat de Catalunya of 1936, in effect until 1939, when it was suppressed by Franco. In 1987 the Government adopted the territorial division again and in 1988 three new comarques were added ([[Alta Ribagorça]], [[Pla d'Urgell]] and [[Pla de l'Estany]]), and in 2015 was created another comarca, the [[Moianès]]. At present there are 41. Every comarca is administered by a [[comarcal council]] ({{lang|ca|consell comarcal}}).

The [[Val d'Aran]] (Aran Valley), until 2015 considered as a comarca, is officially defined today as "unique territorial entity", has a special status and its autonomous government is named {{lang|oc|[[Conselh Generau d'Aran]]}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/CCAA/ca-l16-1990.html# |title=Ley 16/1990, de 13 de julio, sobre el régimen especial del Valle de Arán. |publisher=Noticias Jurídicas |accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref>

==== Municipalities ====
{{Further|Municipalities of Catalonia}}
There are at present 948 municipalities ({{lang|ca|municipis}}) in Catalonia. Each municipality is run by a council ({{lang|ca|ajuntament}}) elected every four years by the residents in local elections. The council consists of a number of members ({{lang|ca|regidors}}) depending on population, who elect the [[mayor]] ({{lang|ca|alcalde}} or {{lang|ca|batlle}}). Its seat is the [[town hall]] ({{lang|ca|ajuntament}}, {{lang|ca|casa de la ciutat}} or {{lang|ca|casa de la vila}}).

==== Vegueries ====
{{Main|Vegueries of Catalonia}}
The ''vegueria'' is a new type of division defined as a specific territorial area for the exercise of government and inter-local cooperation with legal personality. The current Statute of Autonomy states vegueries are intended to supersede provinces in Catalonia, and take over many of functions of the comarques.

=== Transport ===

==== Airports ====
[[File:TorreControElPrat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Barcelona El Prat Airport|Barcelona Airport]] tower]]
{{See also|List of airports in Catalonia}}
Airports in Catalonia are owned and operated by [[Aena]] (a [[Government of Spain|Spanish Government]] entity) except two airports in Lleida which are operated by [[Aeroports de Catalunya]] (an entity belonging to the [[Government of Catalonia]]).

* [[Barcelona El Prat Airport]] (Aena)
* [[Girona-Costa Brava Airport]] (Aena)
* [[Reus Airport]] (Aena)
*[[Lleida-Alguaire Airport]] (Aeroports de Catalunya)
*[[Sabadell Airport]] (Aena)
*[[La Seu d'Urgell Airport]] (Aeroports de Catalunya)

==== Ports ====
{{See also|List of ports in Spain}}
Since the Middle Ages, Catalonia has been well integrated into international maritime networks. The [[port of Barcelona]] (owned and operated by {{lang|es|{{ill|Puertos del Estado|es|vertical-align=sup}}}}, a Spanish Government entity) is an industrial, commercial and tourist port of worldwide importance. With 1,950,000 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEUs]] in 2015, it is the first container port in Catalonia, the third in Spain after Valencia and [[Algeciras]] in Andalusia, the 9th in the Mediterranean Sea, the 14th in Europe and the 68th in the world. It is sixth largest cruise port in the world, the first in Europe and the Mediterranean with 2,364,292 passengers in 2014. The ports of [[Tarragona]] (owned and operated by Puertos del Estado) in the southwest and [[Palamós]] near Girona at northeast are much more modest. The port of Palamós and the other ports in Catalonia (26) are operated and administered by {{lang|ca|{{ill|Ports de la Generalitat|ca|vertical-align=sup}}}}, a Catalan Government entity.

The development of these infrastructures, resulting from the topography and history of the Catalan territory, responds strongly to the administrative and political organization of this autonomous community.

==== Roads ====
{{See also|List of primary highways in Catalonia}}
[[File:Autopista C-16.jpg|thumb|right|[[Autovía C-16|Autovia C-16]] ({{lang|ca|Eix del Llobregat}})]]

There are {{convert|12000|km}} of roads throughout Catalonia.

The principal highways are <span style="background: #009; color: white">'''&nbsp;AP-7&nbsp;'''</span> ({{lang|ca|Autopista de la Mediterrània}}) and <span style="background: #009; color: white">'''&nbsp;A-7&nbsp;'''</span> ({{lang|ca|Autovia de la Mediterrània}}). They follow the coast from the [[France|French border]] to [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] and [[Andalusia]]. The main roads generally radiate from Barcelona. The <span style="background: #009; color: white">'''&nbsp;AP-2&nbsp;'''</span> [[File:Spain traffic signal r200.svg|16px]] ({{lang|ca|Autopista del Nord-est}}) and <span style="background: #009; color: white">'''&nbsp;A-2&nbsp;'''</span> ({{lang|ca|Autovia del Nord-est}}) connect inland and onward to Madrid.

Public-own roads in Catalonia are either managed by the autonomous government of Catalonia (e.g., <span style="background: red; color: white">'''&nbsp;C-&nbsp;'''</span> roads) or the [[Spanish government]] (e.g., <span style="background: #009; color: white">'''&nbsp;AP-&nbsp;'''</span>, <span style="background: #009; color: white">'''&nbsp;A-&nbsp;'''</span>, <span style="background: red; color: white">'''&nbsp;N-&nbsp;'''</span> roads).

==== Railways ====
{{See also|Rail transport in Catalonia}}
[[File:RN103007TarJPVL.JPG|thumb|right|[[AVE|High-speed train (AVE)]] at [[Camp de Tarragona]] ]]
Catalonia saw the first railway construction in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 1848, linking Barcelona with [[Mataró]]. Given the topography most lines radiate from Barcelona. The city has both suburban and inter-city services. The main east coast line runs through the province connecting with the [[SNCF]] (French Railways) at [[Portbou]] on the coast.

There are two publicly owned railway companies operating in Catalonia: the Catalan [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya|FGC]] that operates commuter and regional services, and the Spanish national [[RENFE]] that operates long-distance and high-speed rail services (AVE and Avant) and the main commuter and regional service {{lang|ca|[[Rodalies de Catalunya]]}}, administered by the Catalan government since 2010.

[[High-speed rail]] ([[AVE]]) services from [[Madrid]] currently reach Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona. The official opening between Barcelona and Madrid took place 20 February 2008. The journey between Barcelona and Madrid now takes about two-and-a-half hours. A connection to the [[High-speed rail in France#Network|French high-speed TGV network]] has been completed (called the [[Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line]]) and the Spanish AVE service began commercial services on the line 9 January 2013, later offering services to Marseille on their high speed network.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/europe/spain-opens-iberias-high-speed-rail-link-to-europe.html|title=Spain completes Iberia's high-speed link to Europe|last=Barrow|first=Keith|access-date=24 July 2018|language=en-gb}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/high-speed/single-view/view/high-speed-launched-between-france-and-spain.html|title=High speed services between France and Spain launched|last=Ltd|first=DVV Media International|work=Railway Gazette|access-date=25 July 2018|language=en}}</ref> This was shortly followed by the commencement of commercial service by the French TGV on 17 January 2013, leading to an average travel time on the [[List of TGV services#International|Paris-Barcelona TGV]] route of 7h 42m.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetrainline.com/en/train-times/barcelona-to-paris|title=Barcelona to Paris from €35 in 6h29m {{!}} Times, Tickets & Info|website=www.thetrainline.com|language=en|access-date=25 July 2018}}</ref> This new line passes through [[Girona]] and [[Figueres]] with a [[Perthus Tunnel|tunnel]] through the Pyrenees.

Historically, all the Catalan population was [[Christianity|Christian]], specifically [[Catholic Church in Spain|Catholic]], but since the 1980s there has been a trend of decline of Christianity and parallel growth of [[irreligion]] (including stances of [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]]) and other religions.

[[File:Paisos catalans.svg|thumb|[[Catalan language|Catalan]]-speaking regions of Europe]]

According to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013, Spanish is the most spoken language in Catalonia (46.53% claim Spanish as "their own language"), followed by [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (37.26% claim Catalan as "their own language"). In everyday use, 11.95% of the population claim to use both languages equally, whereas 45.92% mainly use Spanish and 35.54% mainly use Catalan. There is a significant difference between the [[Barcelona metropolitan area]] (and, to a lesser extent, the [[Camp de Tarragona|Tarragona area]]), where Spanish is more spoken than Catalan, and the more rural and small town areas, where Catalan clearly prevails over Spanish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idescat.cat/dequavi/?TC=444&V0=15&V1=2 |title=Idescat. Dades demogràfiques i de qualitat de vida |publisher=Idescat.cat |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

Originating in the historic territory of Catalonia, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] has enjoyed special status since the approval of the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]] which declares it to be "Catalonia's own language",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a6 |title=Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (Article 6) |publisher=Gencat.cat |accessdate=25 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528011550/http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a6 |archivedate=28 May 2008 }}</ref> a term which signifies a language given special legal status within a Spanish territory, or which is historically spoken within a given region. The other languages with official status in Catalonia are Spanish, which has official status throughout Spain, and Aranese Occitan, which is spoken in Val d'Aran.

Since the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]], [[Aranese]] (a dialect of [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]] [[Occitan]]) has also been official and subject to special protection in Val d'Aran. This small area of 7,000 inhabitants was the only place where a dialect of Occitan has received full official status. Then, on 9 August 2006, when the new Statute came into force, Occitan became official throughout Catalonia. Occitan is the mother tongue of 22.4% of the population of Val d'Aran, which has attracted heavy immigration from other Spanish regions to work in the service industry.<ref>[http://www20.gencat.cat/docs/Llengcat/Documents/Dades_territori_poblacio/Altres/Arxius/EULP2008.pdf Enquesta d'usos lingüístics de la població 2008], cap. 8. ''La Val d'Aran''.</ref> [[Catalan Sign Language]] is also officially recognised.<ref name="estatut_langs" />

Although not considered an "official language" in the same way as Catalan, Spanish, and [[Occitan language|Occitan]], the [[Catalan Sign Language]], with about 18,000 users in Catalonia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=csc |title=Catalan Sign Language |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date=19 February 1999 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref> is granted official recognition and support: "The public authorities shall guarantee the use of Catalan sign language and conditions of equality for deaf people who choose to use this language, which shall be the subject of education, protection and respect."<ref name="estatut_langs"/>

As was the case since the ascent of the Bourbon dynasty to the throne of Spain after the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], and with the exception of the short period of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], under [[Francoist Spain]] Catalan was banned from schools and all other official use, so that for example families were not allowed to officially register children with Catalan names.<ref>{{cite book| author = Joan Miralles i Montserrat|author2=Josep Massot i Muntaner| title = Entorn de la histáoria de la llengua| year = 2001| publisher = L'Abadia de Montserrat| isbn = 978-84-8415-309-2| page = 72 }}</ref> Although never completely banned, Catalan language publishing was severely restricted during the early 1940s, with only religious texts and small-run self-published texts being released. Some books were published clandestinely or circumvented the restrictions by showing publishing dates prior to 1936.<ref>{{cite book| author = Pelai Pagès i Blanch| title = Franquisme i repressió: la repressió franquista als països catalans 1939–1975| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OWDyyyaL7dMC&pg=PA182| accessdate = 6 January 2011| year = 2004| publisher = Universitat de València| isbn = 978-84-370-5924-2 }}</ref> This policy was changed in 1946, when restricted publishing in Catalan resumed.<ref>{{cite book| author = Pelai Pagès i Blanch| title = Franquisme i repressió: la repressió franquista als països catalans (1939–1975)| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OWDyyyaL7dMC&pg=PA182| year = 2004| publisher = Universitat de València| isbn = 978-84-370-5924-2 }}</ref>

Rural–urban migration originating in other parts of Spain also reduced the social use of Catalan in urban areas and increased the use of Spanish. Lately, a similar [[sociolinguistic]] phenomenon has occurred with foreign immigration. Catalan cultural activity increased in the 1960s and the teaching of Catalan began thanks to the initiative of associations such as [[Òmnium Cultural]].

After the end of Francoist Spain, the newly established self-governing democratic institutions in Catalonia embarked on a long-term [[language policy]] to recover the use of Catalan<ref>{{cite book| author = M. Teresa Turell| title = Multilingualism in Spain: Sociolinguistic and Psycholinguistic Aspects of Linguistic Minority Groups| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=li0Fmtfxd6kC&pg=PA64| accessdate = 25 April 2010| year = 2001| publisher = Multilingual Matters| isbn = 978-1-85359-491-5 }}</ref> and has, since 1983, enforced laws which attempt to protect and extend the use of Catalan. This policy, known as the "linguistic normalisation" ({{lang|ca|normalització lingüística}} in Catalan, {{lang|es|normalización lingüística}} in Spanish) has been supported by the vast majority of Catalan political parties through the last thirty years.

Basic public education is given basically in Catalan, but also there are some hours per week of Spanish medium instruction. Although businesses are required by law to display all information (e.g. menus, posters) at least in Catalan, this not systematically enforced. There is no obligation to display this information in either Occitan or Spanish, although there is no restriction on doing so in these or other languages. The use of fines was introduced in a 1997 linguistic law<ref>{{cite web |url=http://llengua.gencat.cat/permalink/78000b57-5382-11e4-8f3f-000c29cdf219 |title=Catalonia's linguistic law |publisher=gencat.cat |accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref> that aims to increase the public use of Catalan and defend the rights of Catalan speakers. On the other hand, the Spanish Constitution does not recognize equal language rights for national minorities since it enshrined Spanish as the only official language of the state, the knowledge of which being compulsory. Numerous laws regarding for instance the labelling of pharmaceutical products, make in effect Spanish the only language of compulsory use. 

The law ensures that both Catalan and Spanish – being official languages – can be used by the citizens without prejudice in all public and private activities,.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://llengua.gencat.cat/permalink/78000b57-5382-11e4-8f3f-000c29cdf219 |title=Second article of Catalonia's linguistic law |publisher=gencat.cat |accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref> The Generalitat uses Catalan in its communications and notifications addressed to the general population, but citizens can also receive information from the Generalitat in Spanish if they so desire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://llengua.gencat.cat/permalink/78000b57-5382-11e4-8f3f-000c29cdf219 |title=Ninth article of Catalonia's Linguistic Law |publisher=gencat.cat |accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref> Debates in the Catalan Parliament take place almost exclusively in Catalan and the [[TV3 (Catalonia)|Catalan public television]] broadcasts programs basically in Catalan.

The Catalan language policy has been challenged by some political parties in the Catalan Parliament. [[Citizens - Party of the Citizenry|Citizens]], currently the main opposition party, has been one of the most consistent critics of the Catalan language policy within Catalonia. The Catalan branch of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] has a more ambiguous position on the issue: on one hand, it demands a bilingual Catalan–Spanish education and a more balanced language policy that would defend Catalan without favoring it over Spanish,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y3yT9t_IDA |title=Alicia Sánchez-Camacho responde en 'Tengo una pregunta para usted' |publisher=YouTube |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> whereas on the other hand, a few local PP politicians have supported in their municipalities measures privileging Catalan over Spanish<ref>{{cite web|author=Regió7 |url=http://www.regio7.cat/arreu-catalunya-espanya-mon/2010/10/28/ppc-votar-favor-dun-reglament-sobre-catala/110435.html |title=El PPC va votar a favor d´un reglament sobre el català - Regió7.

Catalonia has given to the world many important figures in the area of the art. Catalan painters internationally known are, among others, [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Joan Miró]] and [[Antoni Tàpies]]. Closely linked with the Catalan pictorial atmosphere, [[Pablo Picasso]] lived in Barcelona during his youth, training them as an artist and creating the movement of [[cubism]]. Other important artists are [[Claudi Lorenzale]] for the medieval [[Romanticism]] that marked the artistic Renaixença, [[Marià Fortuny]] for the Romanticism and Catalan Orientalism of the nineteenth century, [[Ramon Casas]] or [[Santiago Rusiñol]], main representatives of the pictorial current of Catalan modernism from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, [[Josep Maria Sert]] for early 20th-century Noucentisme, or [[Josep Maria Subirachs]] for expressionist or abstract sculpture and painting of the late twentieth century.

The most important painting museums of Catalonia are the [[Teatre-Museu Dalí]] in Figueres, the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]] (MNAC), [[Picasso Museum, Barcelona|Picasso Museum]], [[Fundació Antoni Tàpies]], [[Joan Miró Foundation]], the [[Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MACBA), the [[Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona|Centre of Contemporary Culture of Barcelona]] (CCCB) and the [[CaixaForum Barcelona|CaixaForum]].

In the field of architecture were developed and adapted to Catalonia different artistic styles prevalent in Europe, leaving footprints in many churches, monasteries and cathedrals, of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]<ref>Antoni Pladevall i Font: ''El Romànic català''. A ''El llibre d'or de l'art català''.</ref> (the best examples of which are located in the northern half of the territory) and [[Gothic style]]s. The Gothic developed in Barcelona and its area of influence is known as [[Catalan Gothic]], with some particular characteristics. The church of [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]] is an example of this kind of style. During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers.

There are some examples of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] (such as the Palau de la Generalitat), [[Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]]s. In the late nineteenth century [[Modernisme|Modernism]] ([[Art Nouveau]]) appeared as the national art. The world-renowned Catalan architects of this style are [[Antoni Gaudí]], [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] and [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]]. Thanks to the urban expansion of Barcelona during the last decades of the century and the first ones of the next, many buildings of the [[Eixample]] are modernists. In the field of [[architectural rationalism]], which turned especially relevant in Catalonia during the Republican era (1931-1939) highlighting [[Josep Lluís Sert]] and Josep Torres i Clavé, members of the [[GATCPAC]] and, in contemporany architecture, [[Ricardo Bofill]] and [[Enric Miralles]].

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Literature of Catalonia}}
The oldest surviving literary use of the Catalan language is considered to be the religious text known as [[Homilies d'Organyà]], written either in late 11th or early 12th century.

There are two historical moments of splendor of Catalan literature. The first begins with the historiographic chronicles of the 13th century (chronicles written between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries narrating the deeds of the monarchs and leading figures of the Crown of Aragon) and the subsequent Golden Age of the 14th and 15th centuries. After that period, between the 16th and 19th centuries the Romantic [[historiography]] defined this era as the {{lang|ca|[[Decadència]]}}, considered as the "decadent" period in Catalan literature because of a general falling into disuse of the vernacular language in cultural contexts and lack of patronage among the nobility.

[[File:Rodoreda.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb|left|[[Mercè Rodoreda]] ]]
The second moment of splendor began in the 19th century with the cultural and political {{lang|ca|[[Renaixença]]}} (Renaissance) represented by writers and poets such as [[Jacint Verdaguer]], [[Víctor Català]] (pseudonym of [[Caterina Albert i Paradís]]), [[Narcís Oller]], [[Joan Maragall]] and [[Àngel Guimerà]]. During the 20th century, avant-garde movements developed, initiated by the Generation of '14 (called [[Noucentisme]] in Catalonia), represented by [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Joan Salvat-Papasseit]], [[Josep Carner]], [[Carles Riba]], [[Josep Vicenç Foix i Mas|J.V. Foix]] and others. During the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the Civil War ([[Generation of '36]]) and the Francoist period, Catalan literature was maintained despite the repression against the Catalan language, being often produced in exile. [[File:Ana María Matute.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb|[[Ana María Matute]] ]] The most outstanding authors of this period are [[Salvador Espriu]], [[Josep Pla]], [[Josep Maria de Sagarra]] (the latter three being considered as the main responsible of the renewal of Catalan prose), [[Mercè Rodoreda]], Joan Oliver Sallarès or "[[Pere Quart]]", [[Pere Calders]], [[Gabriel Ferrater]], [[Manuel de Pedrolo]], [[Agustí Bartra]] or [[Miquel Martí i Pol]]. In addition, several foreign writers who fought in the framework of the [[International Brigades]] then recount their experiences of fighting in their works, historical or fictional, with for example ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' of the British [[George Orwell]] in 1938 or {{lang|fr|[[Le Palace (Claude Simon)|Le Palace]]}} in 1962 and ''[[The Georgics (Claude Simon)|The Georgics]]'' in 1981 by Frenchman [[Claude Simon]].

After the transition to democracy (1975–1978) and the restoration of the Generalitat (1977), literary life and the editorial market have returned to normality and literary production in Catalan is being bolstered with a number of language policies intended to protect Catalan culture. Besides the aforementioned authors, other relevant 20th-century writers of the Francoist and democracy periods include [[Joan Brossa]], [[Agustí Bartra]], [[Manuel de Pedrolo]], [[Pere Calders]] or [[Quim Monzó]].

[[Ana María Matute]], [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], [[Manuel Vázquez Montalbán]] and [[Juan Goytisolo]] are among the most prominent Catalan writers in the Spanish language since the democratic restoration in Spain.

=== Festivals and public holidays ===
{{Main|Traditions of Catalonia}}
[[File:4 de 9 amb folre i pilar.jpg|thumb|Castell 4 de 9 amb folre i pilar by Colla Vella de Valls]]

[[Castell]]s are one of the main manifestations of Catalan popular culture. The activity consists in constructing human towers by competing {{lang|ca|colles castelleres}} (teams). This practice originated in [[Valls]], on the region of the Camp de Tarragona, during the 18th century, and later it was extended along the next two centuries to the rest of the territory. The tradition of [[Castell|els Castells i els Castellers]] was declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by [[UNESCO]] in 2010.

In main celebrations, other elements of the Catalan popular culture are also usually present: parades with {{lang|ca|[[Gegants i capgrossos|gegants]]}} (giants), bigheads, stick-dancers and musicians, and the {{lang|ca|[[correfoc]]}}, where devils and monsters dance and spray showers of sparks using firecrackers. Another traditional celebration in Catalonia is {{lang|ca|[[Patum de Berga|La Patum de Berga]]}}, declared a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by the [[UNESCO]] on 25 November 2005.<ref>[http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp Patum de Berga]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227050231/http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp |date=27 February 2009 }}</ref>
[[File:Festa major de la Seu d'Urgell.JPG|thumb|left|{{lang|ca|[[Gigantes y cabezudos|Gegants i capgrossos]]}} during the festa major of [[La Seu d'Urgell]] ]]

[[Christmas]] in Catalonia lasts two days, plus [[Christmas Eve]]. On the 25th, Christmas is celebrated, followed by a similar feast on the 26, called Sant Esteve (Saint Steve's Day). This allows families to visit and dine with different sectors of the extended family, or get together with friends on the second day.

One of the most deeply-rooted and curious [[Christmas traditions]] is the popular figure of the {{lang|ca|[[Tió de Nadal]]}}, consisting of an (often hollow) log with a face painted on it and often two little front legs appended, usually wearing a Catalan hat and scarf. Note that the word has nothing to do with the Spanish word ''tío'', meaning uncle. ''Tió'' means log in Catalan. The log is sometimes "found in the woods" (in an event staged for children) and then adopted and taken home, where it is fed and cared for during a month or so. On [[Christmas Day]] or on [[Christmas Eve]], a game is played where children march around the house singing a song requesting the log to poop, then they tap the log gently with a stick, as if a magic wand, to make it poop, and lo and behold, as if through magic, it poops candy, and sometimes other small gifts. Usually the larger or main gifts are brought by the Three Kings on 6 January, and the tió only brings small things.
 
[[File:Tió de Nadal.jpg|thumb|A tió exhibited at Plaça Sant Jaume in Barcelona in the 2010–2011 Christmas season.]]

Another custom is to make a {{lang|ca|pessebre}} (nativity scene) in the home or in shop windows, the latter sometimes competing in originality or shear size and detail. Churches often host exhibits of numerous dioramas by nativity scene makers, or a single nativity scene they put out, and town halls generally put out a nativity scene in the central square. In Barcelona, every year, the main nativity scene is designed by different artists, and often ends up being an interesting, post-modern or conceptual and strange creation. In the home, the nativity scene often consists of strips of cork bark to represent cliffs or mountains in the background, moss as grass in the foreground, some wood chips or other as dirt, and aluminum foil for rivers and lakes. The traditional figurines often included are the three wise men on camels or horses, which are moved every day or so to go closer to the manger, a star with a long tail in the background to lead people to the spot, the annunciation with shepherds having a meal and an angel appearing (hanging from something), a washer lady washing clothes in the pond, sheep, ducks, people carrying packages on their backs, a donkey driver with a load of twigs, and atrezzo such as a starry sky, miniature towns placed in the distance, either Oriental-styled or local-looking, a bridge over the river, trees, etc.

One of the most astonishing and sui-generis figurines traditionally placed in the nativity scene, to the great glee of children, is the {{lang|ca|[[caganer]]}}, a person depicted in the act of defecating.<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12059969|title=A traditional Nativity scene, Catalan-style|work=BBC News |date=23 December 2010|accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref> This figurine is hidden in some corner of the nativity scene and the game is to detect it. Of course, churches forgo this figurine, and the main nativity scene of Barcelona, for instance, likewise does not feature it. The caganer is so popular it has, together with the tió, long been a major part of the Christmas markets, where they come in the guise of your favorite politicians or other famous people, as well as the traditional figures of a Catalan farmer. People often buy a figurine of a caganer in the guise of a famous person they are actually fond of, contrary to what one would imagine, though sometimes people buy a caganer in the guise of someone they dislike, although this means they have to look at them in the home...

Another (extended) Christmas tradition is the celebration of the Epiphany on 6 January, which is called ''Reis'', meaning Three Kings Day. This is every important in Catalonia and the Catalan-speaking areas, and families go to watch major parades on the eve of the Epiphany, where they can greet the kings and watch them pass by in pomp and circumstance, on floats and preceded and followed by pages, musicians, dancers, etc. They often give the kings letters with their gift requests, which are collected by the pages. On the next day, the children find the gifts the three kings brought for them.

In addition to traditional local Catalan culture, traditions from other parts of Spain can be found as a result of migration from other regions, for instance the celebration of the Andalusian {{lang|es|[[Seville Fair|Feria de Abril]]}} in Catalonia.

On 28 July 2010, second only after the [[Canary Islands]], [[Ban on bullfighting in Catalonia|Catalonia became another Spanish territory to forbid bullfighting]]. The ban, which went into effect on 1 January 2012, had originated in a popular petition supported by over 180,000 signatures.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tremlett|first1=Giles|title=Catalonia votes to ban bullfighting|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/28/bullfighting-ban-spain-catalonia|accessdate=11 October 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 July 2010}}</ref>

=== Music and dance ===
{{Main|Music of Catalonia}}
[[File:Sardanes.jpg|thumb|[[Sardana]]]]

The [[sardana]] is considered to be the most characteristic Catalan folk dance, interpreted to the rhythm of [[Tambori|tamborí]], [[tible]] and [[tenora]] (from the oboe family), [[trumpet]], trombó ([[trombone]]), fiscorn (family of bugles) and contrabaix with three strings played by a [[cobla]], and are danced in a circle dance. Other tunes and dances of the traditional music are the contrapàs (obsolete today), [[ball de bastons]] (the "dance of sticks"), the moixiganga, the goigs (popular songs), the [[galop]]s or the [[Jota (music)|jota]] in the southern part. The [[Habanera (music)|havaneres]] are characteristic in some marine localities of the Costa Brava, especially during the summer months when these songs are sung outdoors accompanied by a {{lang|ca|cremat}} of burned rum.

Art music was first developed, up to the nineteenth century and, as in much of Europe, in a liturgical setting, particularly marked by the Escolania de Montserrat. The main Western musical trends have marked these productions, medieval monodies or polyphonies, with the work of [[Abbot Oliba]] in the eleventh century or the compilation [[Llibre Vermell de Montserrat]] ("Red Book of Montserrat") from the fourteenth century. Through the Renaissance there were authors such as [[Pere Albert Vila]], [[Joan Brudieu]] or the two [[Mateu Fletxa]] ("The Old" and "The Young"). Baroque had composers like [[Joan Cererols]]. The Romantic music was represented by composers such as [[Fernando Sor]], [[Josep Anselm Clavé]] (father of choir movement in Catalonia and responsible of the music folk reviving) or [[Felip Pedrell]].

Modernisme also expressed in musical terms from the end of the 19th century onwards, mixing folkloric and post-romantic influences, through the works of [[Isaac Albéniz]] and [[Enric Granados]]. The avant-garde spirit initiated by the modernists is prolonged throughout the twentieth century, thanks to the activities of the [[Orfeó Català]], a choral society founded in 1891, with its monumental concert hall, the [[Palau de la Música Catalana]] in Catalan, built by Lluís Domènech i Montaner from 1905 to 1908, the [[Barcelona Symphony Orchestra]] created in 1944 and composers, conductors and musicians engaged against the Francoism like [[Robert Gerhard]], [[Eduard Toldrà]] and [[Pau Casals]].

Performances of [[opera]], mostly imported from Italy, began in the 18th century, but some native operas were written as well, including the ones by [[Domènec Terradellas]], [[Carles Baguer]], [[Ramon Carles]], Isaac Albéniz and Enric Granados. The Barcelona main opera house, [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]] (opened in 1847), remains one of the most important in Spain, hosting one of the most prestigious music schools in Barcelona, the [[Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu]]. Several lyrical artists trained by this institution gained international renown during the 20th century, such as [[Victoria de los Ángeles]], [[Montserrat Caballé]], [[Giacomo Aragall]] and [[Josep Carreras]].

Cellist [[Pau Casals]] is admired as an outstanding player. Other popular musical styles were born in the second half of the 20th century such as [[Nova Cançó]] from the 1960s with [[Lluís Llach]] and the group [[Els Setze Jutges]], the [[Catalan rumba]] in the 1960s with [[Peret]], [[Catalan Rock]] from the late 1970s with [[La Banda Trapera del Río]] and [[Decibelios]] for Punk Rock, [[Sau (band)|Sau]], [[Els Pets]], [[Sopa de Cabra]] or [[Lax'n'Busto]] for [[pop rock]] or [[Sangtraït]] for hard rock, electropop since the 1990s with [[OBK]] and [[indie pop]] from the 1990s.

=== Media and cinema ===
{{Main|Cinema of Catalonia}}
[[File:TVC.svg|thumb|Logo of Televisió de Catalunya]]
Catalonia is the autonomous community, along with Madrid, that has the most media (TV, Magazines, Newspapers etc.). In Catalonia there is a wide variety of local and comarcal media. With the restoration of democracy, many newspapers and magazines, until then in the hands of the Franco government, were recovered in order to convert them into free and democratic media, while local radios and televisions were implemented.

[[Televisió de Catalunya]], which broadcasts entirely in the Catalan language, is the main Catalan public TV. It has five channels: [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], [[El 33]], [[Super3]], [[3/24]], [[Esport3]] and [[TV3CAT]]. In 2018, TV3 became the first television channel to be the most viewed one for nine consecutive years in Catalonia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ccma.cat/tv3/any-de-records-a-tv3-lider-daudiencia-per-nove-any-consecutiu-i-millor-resultat-dels-ultims-6-anys/noticia/2895171/|title=TV3 lidera l'audiència per 9è any consecutiu i té el millor resultat dels últims 6 anys|date=1 January 2019|work=CCMA|access-date=1 January 2019|language=ca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102002110/https://www.ccma.cat/tv3/any-de-records-a-tv3-lider-daudiencia-per-nove-any-consecutiu-i-millor-resultat-dels-ultims-6-anys/noticia/2895171/|archive-date=2 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ara.cat/media/TV3-estableix-nou-liderat-consecutius_0_2153784649.html|title=TV3 estableix un nou rècord: nou anys de liderat consecutius|last=Gutiérrez|first=Àlex|date=31 December 2018|work=Diari Ara|access-date=1 January 2019|language=ca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101002826/https://www.ara.cat/media/TV3-estableix-nou-liderat-consecutius_0_2153784649.html|archive-date=1 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> State televisions that broadcast in Catalonia in Spanish language include [[Televisión Española]] (with few emissions in Catalan), [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]], [[Cuatro (TV channel)|Cuatro]], [[Telecinco]], and [[La Sexta]]. Other smaller Catalan television channels include; [[8TV (Catalonia)|8TV]] (owned by Grup Godó), [[FC Barcelona media|Barça TV]] and the local televisions, the greatest exponent of which is {{interlanguage link|betevé|ca}}, the TV channel of Barcelona, which also broadcasts in Catalan.

The two main Catalan newspapers of general information are ''[[El Periódico de Catalunya]]'' and ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', both with editions in Catalan and Spanish. Catalan only published newspapers include ''[[Ara (newspaper)|Ara]]'' and ''[[El Punt Avui]]'' (from the fusion of ''[[El Punt]]'' and ''[[Avui]]'' in 2011), as well as most part of the local press. The Spanish newspapers, such as ''[[El País]]'', ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' or ''[[La Razón (Madrid)|La Razón]]'', can be also acquired.

Catalonia has a long tradition of use of radio, the first regular radio broadcast in the country was from Ràdio Barcelona in 1924.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1974/04/24/049.html|title=ABC (Madrid) - 24/04/1974, p. 49 - ABC.es Hemeroteca|accessdate=22 October 2018|website=hemeroteca.abc.es|language=es}}</ref> Today, the public [[Catalunya Ràdio]] (owned by [[Corporació Catalana de Mitjans Audiovisuals|Catalan Media Corporation]]) and the private [[RAC 1]] (belonging to Grup Godó) are the two main radios of Catalonia, both in Catalan.

[[File:Festival Internacional de Cinema de Catalunya 2009.JPG|thumb|[[Sitges Film Festival]] of 2009]]
Regarding the cinema, after the democratic transition, three styles have dominated since then. First, auteur cinema, in the continuity of the [[Barcelona School of Film|Barcelona School]], emphasizes experimentation and form, while focusing on developing social and political themes. Worn first by [[Josep Maria Forn]] or [[Bigas Luna]], then by [[Marc Recha]], [[Jaime Rosales]] and [[Albert Serra]], this genre has achieved some international recognition. Then, the [[documentary]] became another genre particularly representative of contemporary Catalan cinema, boosted by [[Joaquim Jordà i Català]] and [[José Luis Guerín]]. Later, horror films and thrillers have also emerged as a specialty of the Catalan film industry, thanks in particular to the vitality of the [[Sitges Film Festival]], created in 1968. Several directors have gained worldwide renown thanks to this genre, starting with Jaume Balagueró and his series ''[[REC (film)|REC]]'' (co-directed with Valencian Paco Plaza), [[Juan Antonio Bayona]] and ''[[El orfanato|El Orfanato]]'' or [[Jaume Collet-Serra]] with ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'', ''[[Unknown (2011 film)|Unknown]]'' and ''[[Non-Stop (film)|Non-Stop]]''.

Catalan actors have shot for Spanish and international productions, such as [[Sergi López (actor)|Sergi López]].

The [[Museum of Cinema - Tomàs Mallol Collection]] (Museu del Cinema - Col.lecció Tomàs Mallol in Catalan) of Girona is home of important permanent exhibitions of cinema and pre-cinema objects. Other important institutions for the promotion of cinema are the [[Gaudí Awards]] (Premis Gaudí in Catalan, which replaced from 2009 Barcelona Film Awards themselves created in 2002), serving as equivalent for Catalonia to the Spanish [[Goya Awards|Goya]] or French [[César Award|César]].

=== Philosophy ===
{{See also|Seny}}
{{lang|ca|Seny}} is a form of ancestral Catalan wisdom or sensibleness. It involves well-pondered perception of situations, level-headedness, awareness, integrity, and right action. Many Catalans consider seny something unique to their culture, is based on a set of ancestral local customs stemming from the scale of values and social norms of their society.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport in Catalonia}}
Sport has a distinct importance in Catalan life and culture since the beginning of the 20th century and consequently, has a well developed sport infrastructure. The main sports are [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[handball]], [[rink hockey]], [[tennis]] and [[motorsport]].

Despite the fact that the most popular sports are represented outside by the Spanish national teams, Catalonia can officially play as itself in some others, like [[korfball]], [[futsal]] or [[rugby league]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seleccions.cat/index.php/seleccions-reconegudes/esports-reconeguts|title=Esports reconeguts|website=www.seleccions.cat|access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref> Most of Catalan Sports Federations have a long tradition and some of them participated in the foundation of international sports federations, as the Catalan Federation of Rugby, that was one of the founder members of the [[FIRA – Association of European Rugby|Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur]] (FIRA) in 1934.<ref name="fira-aer-rugby.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.fira-aer-rugby.com/article_detail.php?article=33 |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216142416/http://www.fira-aer-rugby.com/article_detail.php?article=33 |archive-date=16 February 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The majority of Catalan sport federations are part of the [[Sports Federation Union of Catalonia]] (Catalan: {{lang|ca|Unió de Federacions Esportives de Catalunya}}), founded in 1933.

Catalan gastronomy has a long culinary tradition. Various local food recipes have been described in documents dating from the fifteenth century. As with all the cuisines of the Mediterranean, Catatonian dishes make abundant use of [[Fish as food|fish]], seafood, [[olive oil]], [[bread]] and [[vegetables]]. Regional specialties include the {{lang|ca|[[pa amb tomàquet]]}} (bread with tomato), which consists of bread (sometimes toasted), and [[tomato]] seasoned with olive oil and salt. Often the dish is accompanied with any number of sausages (cured [[Botifarra|botifarres]], [[fuet]], iberic ham, etc.), ham or cheeses. Others dishes include the {{lang|ca|[[calçotada]]}}, {{lang|ca|[[escudella i carn d'olla]]}}, {{lang|ca|suquet de peix}} (fish stew), and a [[dessert]], [[Catalan cream]].

Catalan vineyards also have several {{lang|ca|[[Denominación de origen|Denominacions d'Origen]]}} wines, such as: [[Priorat (DOQ)|Priorat]], [[Montsant DO|Montsant]], [[Penedès (DO)|Penedès]] and [[Empordà (DO)|Empordà]]. There is also a sparkling wine, the [[Cava (Spanish wine)|cava]].<ref>[http://www.cava-and-co.com/ Site ''cava'']</ref>
