The burial occurred privately later the same day. Diana's former husband, sons, mother, siblings, a close friend, and a clergyman were present. Diana's body was clothed in a black long-sleeved, three-quarter length woolen cocktail dress designed by [[Catherine Walker (fashion designer)|Catherine Walker]] which she had chosen some weeks before, a pair of black pantyhose, and a pair of black shoes. A set of [[rosary]] beads was placed in her hands, a gift she had received from [[Mother Teresa]], who died the same week as Diana.
In her hands there was also a photograph of her sons, a photo which travelled around with her and had been found in her handbag.<ref>{{Cite book|title=DIANA, HER TRUE STORY|last=MORTON|first=ANDREW|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Paul Burrell reportedly also took some pictures of Prince Harry and Prince William from under her glass dressing table from her Kensington Palace apartment and put them in her coffin as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2423394&page=1|title=Diana Wanted to Become America's First Lady, Butler Says|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=2020-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608134125/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2423394&page=1|archive-date=2015-06-08|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the ceremony, the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom|Royal Standard]] which had covered the coffin was removed by Diana's brother moments before she was buried, and replaced with the Spencer family flag; the Earl claimed that "She (Diana) is a Spencer now." Princes Charles, William and Harry agreed to the change. However, [[Paul Burrell]], Diana's former butler, condemned the move, telling the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' that "It had more to do with his Spencer v Windsor war than doing what Diana would have wanted. It was inappropriate and disrespectful. I knew it was not what Diana would have wanted. With that act, her brother was depriving the Princess of her proper status in life – a status of which she was proud." Earl Spencer called Burrell's comments "hurtful lies" and said in a statement: "The Queen's standard was removed as part of the ceremony by her own officer in a dignified and pre-agreed manner".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2418845.stm|title=Earl disputes butler 'lies'|publisher=BBC|date=8 November 2002|accessdate=17 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318121436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2418845.stm|archive-date=2018-03-18|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/earl-disputes-burrells-story-of-princesss-funeral-flag-db53f9lc63t|title=Earl disputes Burrell's story of Princess's funeral flag|work=The Times|first=Ian|last=Cobain|date=9 November 2002|accessdate=17 March 2018|url-access=subscription|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318120605/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/earl-disputes-burrells-story-of-princesss-funeral-flag-db53f9lc63t|archive-date=2018-03-18|url-status=live}}</ref>

The original plan was for Diana to be buried in the Spencer family vault at the local church in nearby [[Great Brington]], but Lord Spencer said that he was concerned about [[public safety]] and security and the onslaught of visitors that might overwhelm Great Brington. He decided that Diana would be buried where her grave could be easily cared for and visited in privacy by William, Harry, and other Spencer relatives.<ref name=sht6sep/>

The island is in an ornamental lake known as The Round Oval within Althorp Park's gardens.<ref name=timegrave>{{cite news|title=Top 10 Celebrity Grave Sites|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1919236_1919237_1920165,00.html|accessdate=1 June 2013|newspaper=Time|date=3 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826142755/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1919236_1919237_1920165,00.html|archive-date=2013-08-26|url-status=live}}</ref> A path with thirty-six oak trees, marking each year of her life, leads to the Oval. Four black swans swim in the lake. In the water there are water lilies, which, in addition to white roses, were Diana's favourite flowers.

The burial party was provided by the 2nd Battalion [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]], who were given the honour of carrying the Princess across to the island and laying her to rest. Diana was the Regiment's [[Colonel-in-Chief]] from 1992 to 1996.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/5871774/Diana-Princess-of-Wales.html|title=Diana, Princess of Wales|date=31 August 1997|accessdate=25 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004230546/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/5871774/Diana-Princess-of-Wales.html|archivedate=4 October 2015}}</ref>
