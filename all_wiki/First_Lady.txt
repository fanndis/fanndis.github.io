'''First Lady''' is an unofficial title usually used for the wife, and occasionally used for the daughter or other female relative,<!-- e.g., Peru with Keiko Fujimori --> of a non-[[monarchy|monarchical]] [[head of state]] or [[chief executive]].<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/first%20lady ''First Lady'', Merriam-Webster Dictionary], retrieved 2014-12-30</ref><ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/First-Lady ''First Lady'', Oxford Dictionaries], retrieved 2014-12-30</ref><ref>Amanda Foreman, "Our First Ladies and Their Predecessors", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', May 30–31, 2015, C11, https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-first-ladies-and-their-predecessors-1432830990, retrieved 2015-5-30</ref> The term is also used to describe a woman seen to be at the top of her profession or art.<ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/first-lady ''First Lady'', Collins English Dictionary], retrieved 2014-12-30</ref>

The term is often used to a non-monarchical heads of state or chief executives who don't have that kind of style in their own country. Some countries have a title, official or unofficial, that is or can be translated as ''first lady''.<ref name=colombia>{{cite web|url=http://wsp.presidencia.gov.co/Prensa/2010/Octubre/Paginas/20101001_15.aspx|title='He asumido mi compromiso con la niñez de Colombia con toda la disposición de mi corazón', afirma la Primera Dama|first=Design by Paul Andres Gomez|last=M.}}</ref>  The title is not normally used for the wife of a head of government who is not also head of state.

'''First Gentleman''' is the male equivalent of the title in countries where the head of state's spouse has been a man, such as the [[Philippines]] or [[Malta]]. While there has never been a male spouse of a U.S. president, "[[List of first gentlemen in the United States|First Gentleman]]" is used in the United States for the husband of a [[mayor]], [[Governor (United States)|governor]], or president.

'''First Spouse''', a rare version of the title, can be used in either case where the spouse of a head of state is of any gender.  This term is used to promote [[gender equality]] and [[gender neutrality]].

'''First Partner''' is also a rare version of the title, and can be used in case he or she are not married at the time being.

{{Main|List of wives of the President of the Italian Republic}}
The wife of the President of the Italian Republic is generally considered to be the first lady of the country. However, it has no official role. Her functions are purely formal: hostess of the [[Quirinal Palace]], she receives the guests of the Head of State. She can attend the ceremonies to which her husband is invited and accompany him when he has to go abroad. In this case, her position is that of a discreet ambassador.

These public activities are not compulsory because, in the past, several wives of presidents have refused to play a public role.

It happened that a President of the Republic was widowed before his election. If he had a daughter, she was invited to act as first lady. The wife of the current president [[Sergio Mattarella]] having died in 2012, three years before his election, it is his daughter [[Laura Mattarella|Laura]] who is considered as the companion of his father and who assist him on several occasions.

===United States of America===
{{main|First Lady of the United States}}
In American media, the term First Lady is often applied to the wife of a head of state in any country, irrespective of whether a different appellation (or none) is used in that country. For example, in 1902, the U.S. publication  ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'' said of the wife of [[Governor General of Canada|Canadian Governor General]] [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|the Earl of Minto]]: "As the first lady in the land, she has done much to weld together the heterogeneous components of a colonial society which includes peoples of different races and of antagonistic religions."<ref>"In The Public Eye: The Governor-General of Canada", p.&nbsp;684. http://www.unz.org/Pub/Munseys-1902feb-00681</ref> The term was also used by ''Munsey's'' to refer to the wife of Mexico's leader, President Porfirio Díaz: In an 1896 piece about "The Daughters of Mexico", author Jeannie Marshall said of Carmen Romero Rubio de Díaz: "She is still a young woman, though she has filled the position of 'first lady of the land' for many years, with marked success."<ref>Jeannie A. Marshall, "[http://www.unz.org/Pub/Munseys-1896sep-00713?View=Search&SearchView=PDFHits&pages=714 The Daughters of Mexico]"</ref> The U.S. Spanish-language newspaper ''[[La Prensa (San Antonio)|La Prensa]]'' also called her "''primera dama''" when writing about her activities.<ref>"Domincales", ''[[La Prensa (San Antonio)|La Prensa]]'', 19 September 1917, p.&nbsp;4</ref>

In the early days of the [[United States]], there was no generally accepted title for the wife of the president. Many early first ladies expressed their own preference for how they were addressed, including the use of such titles as ''Lady''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} One of the earliest uses of the term "first lady" was applied to Martha Washington in a profile by Mrs. C. H. Sigourney in 1838: Mrs. Sigourney, discussing how Martha Washington had not changed, even after her husband [[George Washington|George]] became president, wrote that "The first lady of the nation still preserved the habits of early life. Indulging in no indolence, she left the pillow at dawn, and after breakfast, retired to her chamber for an hour for the study of the scriptures and devotion".<ref name="auto"/> However, the term "first lady" would not come into common use until the late 1800s.

[[Harriet Lane]], niece of bachelor president [[James Buchanan]], was the first woman to be called ''first lady'' while actually serving in that position. The phrase appeared in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Monthly in 1860, when he wrote, "The Lady of the White House, and by courtesy, the First Lady of the Land." Once Harriet Lane was called ''first lady'', the term was applied retrospectively to her predecessors.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The title first gained nationwide recognition in 1877, when [[Mary C. Ames]] wrote an article in the New York City newspaper ''The Independent'' describing the [[Inauguration of Rutherford B. Hayes|inauguration]] of President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]].  She used the term to describe his wife, [[Lucy Webb Hayes]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

While historically the term has generally been used to refer to the wife of a president, there were occasions when another woman, such as the president's daughter, has filled the duties of first lady as hostess in the [[White House]], if the president's wife was unwilling, unable, or if the president was a [[widower]] or [[bachelor]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

{{As of|2020}}, the first lady of the United States is [[Melania Trump]], wife of [[Donald Trump]].

The entire family of the head of state may be known familiarly as the "[[First Family]]".<ref>{{cite web|work=[[dictionary.com]]|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/First%20Family|title=First Family&nbsp;— Definitions from Dictionary.com|accessdate=2007-07-19|quote=2.

===Ukraine===
[[First Lady of Ukraine]] is the unofficial title given by the society to the wife of the [[president of Ukraine]]. Since Ukraine gained independence in 1991, the post has been highly ceremonial and has rarely played a role in social activism (except Marina Poroshenko, the first lady in 2014–19, who was engaged in the movement for [[Inclusion (education)|inclusive education]]<ref name="Poroshenko1">{{cite web |url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/marina-poroshenko-riven-inklyuziyi-v-osviti-pokaznik-stupeny-36072|title= Maryna Poroshenko: The level of inclusion in education is an indicator of the state development degree |accessdate=2017-11-15 |publisher= President of Ukraine}}</ref><ref name="Poroshenko2">{{cite web |url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/marina-poroshenko-ta-roman-kislyak-zustrilisya-u-stolichnomu-36788|title= Maryna Poroshenko and Roman Kysliak met in the coffeehouse in the framework of #накавуздругом social initiative |accessdate=2017-11-15 |publisher= President of Ukraine}}</ref>). The current First Lady of Ukraine is [[Olena Zelenska]], the wife of 6th President of Ukraine [[Volodymyr Zelensky]].

==Non-spousal uses==
In some situations, the title is bestowed upon a non-spouse. This includes terms like "First Family", "First Daughter", and "First Son".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In the past, occasionally another woman, such as the president's daughter, has filled the duties of first lady as hostess in the [[White House]], if the president's wife was unwilling, unable, or if the president was a widower or bachelor. [[Harriet Lane]], niece of bachelor president [[James Buchanan]] was the first non-spouse to be called First Lady.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

South Korean president [[Park Geun-hye]] has been referred to as First Lady to former president [[Park Chung-hee]], who is her father. The title was bestowed upon her after her mother's assassination.<ref>Geun Hye Park (2007).

The title was also officially bestowed on [[Victoria Quirino-Delgado]], the daughter of widower [[Elpidio Quirino]] (1948–53), sixth president of the Philippines. Victoria's mother, Alicia Quirino ''née'' Syquía, had been killed by [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|occupying Japanese troops]] towards the end of the [[Second World War]]. While President [[Corazon Aquino|Corazón Aquino]] (1986–92) was also widowed, the title was not given to her older children who would assist her in official duties. These included her son (and later president) [[Benigno Aquino III]], who was a sort of ''de facto'' first gentleman; his four sisters, as under their mother's presidency, now unofficially share the duties of the first spouse. The current president, [[Rodrigo Duterte]]'s marriage was annulled, and his common-law wife is not qualified to take the title as they are not married yet. Instead, he named his daughter, [[Mayor of Davao City|Davao City Mayor]] [[Sara Duterte]], as first lady.

In 1994, Peruvian president [[Alberto Fujimori]] officially named his daughter [[Keiko Fujimori|Keiko]] "First Lady", after he had separated from his wife [[Susana Higuchi]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

After taking office as [[Puerto Rico]]'s first female governor, Governor [[Sila Maria Calderón]] appointed her two daughters, [[Sila María González Calderón]] and [[María Elena González Calderón]], to serve as first ladies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fvillarinni.tripod.com/silamcalderon/|title=Sila M.

Following the [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, 2010|leadership spill]] which installed [[Julia Gillard]] as the first female [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister of Australia]] on 24 June 2010, some [[news media]] referred to her [[Domestic partnership|de facto partner]], [[Tim Mathieson]], as the "First [[Bloke]]".<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Tim Mathieson: why is Australia's 'first bloke' in the headlines?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/jan/29/tim-mathieson-australias-first-bloke |work=The Guardian |date=29 January 2013 }}</ref>

==Apolitical uses==
It has become commonplace in the United States for the title of "First Lady" to be bestowed on women, as a term of endearment, who have proven themselves to be of exceptional talent or unique notoriety in non-political areas. The phrase is often, but not always, used when the person in question is either the wife or "female equivalent" of a well-known man (or men) in a similar field. For example, the term has been applied in the entertainment field to denote the "First Lady of Television" ([[Lucille Ball]]), the "First Lady of Song" ([[Ella Fitzgerald]]), the "First Lady of Country Music" ([[Tammy Wynette]], although [[Loretta Lynn]] was also known by the title), the "First Lady of ''[[Star Trek]]''" (actor/producer [[Majel Barrett]]), the "First Lady of American [[Soul music|Soul]]" ([[Aretha Franklin]]),<ref>{{cite news | title=Are you ready to think outside the box? The abuses of the English language that readers hated most have inspired a new Telegraph book, explains Richard Preston | work=Daily Telegraph | first=Richard | last=Preston | date=2007-05-25 | page=24}}</ref> the "First Lady of the [[Grand Ole Opry]]" ([[Loretta Lynn]]), and the "First Lady of the American Stage" ([[Helen Hayes]]).<ref>{{cite news | title=The Year Of Hoping For Magic | work=New York Times | first=Joan | last=Didion | date=2007-03-04 | page=1}}</ref>

The term "first lady" is also used to denote a woman who occupies the foremost social position within a particular locality, in this sense being particularly popular in [[Africa]], where the pre-eminent female noble in some chieftaincy hierarchies, such as those of the [[Yoruba people]], is often referred to by the title.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=The City of York in the Sixteenth Century | first=Maud | last=Sellers | journal=The English Historical Review | volume=9 | issue=34 |date=April 1894 | pages=275–304 | doi=10.1093/ehr/IX.XXXIV.275| url=https://zenodo.org/record/1793611 }}; {{Cite journal | title=Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York | first=A. | last=Russell | volume=21 | year=1889 | pages=494–515}}</ref>

In recent years, the term has also been used to refer to the [[Presbytera|wife of the pastor of a church]], especially in predominantly [[black church]]es.<ref>DuBois, Joshua.
