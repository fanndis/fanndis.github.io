The '''abortion debate''' is the ongoing controversy surrounding the moral, legal, and religious status of induced [[abortion]].<ref>Groome, Thomas.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/opinion/to-win-again-democrats-must-stop-being-the-abortion-party.html “To Win Again, Democrats Must Stop Being the Abortion Party.”] ''The New York Times''. 27 March 2017.</ref> In English-speaking countries, the sides involved in the debate are the self-described "[[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]]" and "[[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]]" movements. "Pro-choice" emphasizes the right of women to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. "Pro-life" emphasizes the right of the [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] to gestate to term and be born. Both terms are considered [[loaded word|loaded]] in mainstream media, where terms such as "abortion rights" or "anti-abortion" are generally preferred.<ref>For example: {{cite news|title=Wall Street Journal style guide: Vol. 23, No. 1|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/styleandsubstance/2010/01/31/vol-23-no-1/|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=4 November 2011|date=31 January 2010}}</ref> Each movement has, with varying results, sought to influence public opinion and to attain legal support for its position.

For many people, abortion is essentially a [[morality]] issue, concerning the [[beginning of human personhood|commencement of human personhood]], the [[Fetal rights|rights of the fetus]], and a [[Bodily integrity#Women's rights|woman's right over her own body]]. The debate has become a political and legal issue in some countries with anti-abortion campaigners seeking to enact, maintain and expand [[Abortion law|anti-abortion laws]], while abortion-rights campaigners seek to repeal or ease such laws while expanding access to abortion. Abortion laws vary considerably between jurisdictions, ranging from outright prohibition of the procedure to public funding of abortion. The availability of safe abortion also varies across the world.

==Overview==
In ancient times, abortion, along with [[infanticide]], was considered in the context of [[family planning]], gender selection, population control, and the property rights of the patriarch.<ref>See generally, "The Kindness of Strangers: The Abandonment of Children in Western Europe from Late Antiquity to the Renaissance", John Boswell {{ISBN|978-0-226-06712-4}} Nov 1998, Intro.</ref> Rarely were the rights of the prospective mother, much less the prospective child, taken into consideration.<ref>See generally Spivack, Carla, ''To Bring Down the Flowers: The Cultural Context of Abortion Law in Early Modern England''. Available at SSRN: [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1132482] Introduction</ref> Although generally legal, the morality of abortion, birth control and child abandonment (as a form of infanticide) was sometimes discussed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Then, as now, these discussions often concerned the nature of humankind, the existence of a [[soul]], when life begins, and the [[beginning of human personhood]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

While the practice of infanticide (as a form of family planning) has largely been eradicated in developed countries, [[birth control]] and abortion are still practiced, and their morality and legality continue to be debated. While modern debates about abortion retain some of the languages of these older debates, the terminology has often acquired new meanings.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Discussion of the putative [[personhood]] of the fetus may be complicated by the current legal status of children. Like children or minors in the U.S. a fetus or an embryo is not legally a "person", not having reached the age of majority and not deemed able to enter into contracts and sue or be sued.<ref name="Children_under_the_law">{{cite journal|last1=Rodham|first1=Hillary|title=Children under the law|journal=Harvard Educational Review|date=1973|volume=43|issue=4|pages=487–514|doi=10.17763/haer.43.4.e14676283875773k}}<!--|accessdate=13 November 2015--></ref> Since the 1860s, they have been treated as persons for the limited purposes of [[offence against the person]] law in the UK including N.

As one [[New Jersey Superior Court]] judge noted,

However, these terms do not always reflect a political view or fall along a binary; in one [[Public Religion Research Institute]] poll, seven in ten Americans described themselves as "pro-choice" while almost two-thirds described themselves as "pro-life".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2011/06/committed-to-availability-conflicted-about-morality-what-the-millennial-generation-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-abortion-debate-and-the-culture-wars/ |publisher=Public Religion Research Institute |title=Committed to Availability, Conflicted about Morality: What the Millennial Generation Tells Us about the Future of the Abortion Debate and the Culture Wars |date=9 June 2011}}</ref> Another identifier in the debate is "abolitionist", which harks back to the 19th-century struggle against human [[slavery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/04/11/portrait-anti-abortion-abolitionist/|title=Portrait of an Anti-Abortion 'Abolitionist'|quote=It is no accident that Ragon both calls himself an "abolitionist" and that his group uses these so-called disturbing images.

Appeals are often made in the abortion debate to the [[rights]] of the [[fetus]], pregnant woman, or other parties.  Such appeals can generate confusion if the ''type'' of rights is not specified (whether [[Civil rights|civil]], [[Natural rights|natural]], or otherwise) or if it is simply ''assumed'' that the right appealed to takes precedence over all other competing rights (an example of [[begging the question]]).

The appropriate terms with which to designate the human organism prior to birth are also debated. The medical terms "[[embryo]]" and "[[fetus]]" are seen by some anti-abortion advocates as [[dehumanization|dehumanizing]],<ref>Brennan 'Dehumanizing the vulnerable' 2000</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=Princeton Progressive Review |date=February 1996 |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/nvp/consistent/naomi_wolf.html |author1=Getek, Kathryn |author2=Cunningham, Mark |title=A Sheep in Wolf's Clothing – Language and the Abortion Debate}}</ref> while everyday terms such as "baby" or "child" are viewed as sentimental by some pro-abortion advocates.

The use of the term "baby" to describe the unborn human organism is seen by some scholars as part of an effort to assign the organism agency.

==Political debate==
Politics refers to the processes, defined and limited through legal documents, by which decisions (laws) are made in governments.  In politics, [[Civil rights|rights]] are the protections and privileges legally granted to citizens by the government. In a democracy, certain rights are considered to be [[inalienable right|inalienable]], and thus not subject to grant or withdrawal by government. Regarding [[abortion law]], the political debate usually surrounds a [[right to privacy]], and when or how a government may regulate abortion{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}.  There is abundant debate regarding the extent of abortion regulation.  Some pro-abortion rights advocates argue that it should be illegal for governments to regulate abortion any more than other medical practices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bccla.org/positions/privateoff/72abortion.html |title=Abortion |accessdate=24 May 2007 |work=Positions |publisher=British Columbia Civil Liberties Association |quote=…rights call for complete legal freedom to secure an abortion, in the sense that the legal status of abortion should be the same as that of other medical services that a doctor provides to a patient |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926232717/http://www.bccla.org/positions/privateoff/72abortion.html |archive-date=26 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> On both sides of the debate, some argue{{Who|date=October 2011}} that governments should be permitted to prohibit elective abortions after the 20th week,<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=1455357&pageindex=2 |title=Abortion |volume=119 |issue=6 |pages=42–59 |accessdate=24 May 2007 |date=December 1973|journal=Where We Stand—CMA Position Papers |quote=Good medical practice indicates that abortion should not be performed after the 20th week of pregnancy}}</ref> [[Point of fetal viability|viability]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/research/papers/legalpro.pdf |title=Abortion issues today – a position paper |accessdate=24 May 2007 |last=Lee |first=Ellie |author2=Ann Furedi |date=February 2002 |work=Legal Issues for Pro-Choice Opinion – Abortion Law in Practice |publisher=University of Kent, Canterbury, CT2 7NY, UK |page=2 |quote=While most people have no difficulty accepting the legality of abortion at early stages of pregnancy, fewer are so sure about their position as pregnancy progresses – especially when the fetus is perceived to be 'viable' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926143428/http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/research/papers/legalpro.pdf |archive-date=26 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> or the second [[wiktionary:trimester|trimester]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amwa-doc.org/index.cfm?objectId=0A5BF4D4-D567-0B25-58C7E8584C98D43B |title=Abortion |accessdate=24 May 2007 |year=2000 |work=Positions |publisher=American Medical Women's Association |quote=The 1973 Supreme court decision ''[[Roe v.

===Privacy===
Even though the [[Privacy law|right to privacy]] is not explicitly stated in many constitutions of sovereign nations, many people see it as foundational to a functioning democracy. In general the right to privacy can be found to rest on the provisions of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', which first found official expression under Henry II in 11th century England, but has precedent in Anglo-Saxon law. This provision guarantees the right to freedom from arbitrary government interference, as well as due process of law. This conception of the right to privacy is operant in all countries which have adopted [[English common law]] through Acts of Reception. The [[Law of the United States]] rests on English common law by this means.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' has stated that the issue of bodily [[privacy]] is "the core" of the abortion debate.<ref name="Time">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903358,00.html?promoid=googlep|title=Abortion and Privacy|accessdate=25 May 2007 |date=13 March 1972|publisher=TIME}}</ref> ''Time'' defined privacy, in relation to abortion, as the ability of a woman to "decide what happens to her own body".<ref name="Time"/> In political terms, privacy can be understood as a condition in which one is not observed or disturbed by government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/privacy?view=uk |title=Privacy |accessdate=24 May 2007 |work=Compact Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=AskOxford.com}}</ref>

Traditionally, American courts have located the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]] in the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], as well as the penumbra of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. The landmark decision ''[[Roe v Wade]]'' relied on the 14th Amendment, which guarantees that federal rights shall be applied equally to all persons born in the United States. The 14th Amendment has given rise to the doctrine of [[Substantive due process]], which is said to guarantee various privacy rights, including the right to [http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Substantive+Due+Process bodily integrity]. In Canada, the courts have located privacy rights in the security of persons clause of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Section 7 of that charter echoes language used in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which also guarantees security of persons.

While governments are allowed to invade the privacy of their citizens in some cases, they are expected to protect privacy in all cases lacking a [[strict scrutiny|compelling state interest]]. In the US, the compelling state interest test has been developed in accordance with the standards of strict scrutiny.  In ''Roe v Wade'', the Court decided that the state has an "important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life" from the point of viability on, but that prior to viability, the woman's fundamental rights are more compelling than that of the state.

===Canadian judicial involvement===
{{Main|Abortion in Canada}}
With ''[[R v. Morgentaler]]'', the Supreme Court of Canada removed abortion from the Criminal Code. Relying on the security of person clause of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], the court stated that while the state has an interest in protecting the fetus "at some point", this interest cannot override that of the pregnant woman because: "the right to security of the person of a pregnant woman was infringed more than was required to achieve the objective of protecting the fetus, and the means were not reasonable." The only laws currently governing abortion in Canada are those which govern medical procedures in general, such as those regulating licensing of facilities, the training of medical personnel, and the like. [[Legal protection of access to abortion#Laws in Canada|Laws also exist]] which are intended to prevent anti-abortion activists from interfering with staff and patient access to hospitals and clinics, for instance by creating buffer zones around them.

Because the courts did not specifically establish abortion as a right, Parliament has leave to legislate on this aspect of the matter; and in 1989, the Progressive Conservative government attempted to do just that. A bill was introduced that would allow abortion only if two doctors certified that the woman's health was in danger. This bill passed the House of Commons but was defeated by a tie vote in the Senate.

Several additional cases have considered further issues.

Although the courts have not ruled on the question of fetal personhood, the question has been raised in two cases, ''[[Tremblay v. Daigle]]'' and ''[[R. v. Sullivan]]''. Both cases relied on the [[born alive rule]], inherited from English common law, to determine that the fetus was not a person at law.

Two further cases are notable: ''[[Dobson (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dobson]]'', and ''Winnipeg Child & Family Services (Northwest Area) v. G . (D.F.), [I9971 3 S.C.R. 925 M]'', which dismissed so-called fetal abuse charges.

===Effects of legalization/illegalization===
{{more citations needed section|date=October 2015}}
Pro-abortion rights advocates argue that illegalization of abortion increases the incidence of [[unsafe abortion]]s, as the availability of professional abortion services decreases, and leads to increased [[maternal mortality]]. According to a global study collaboratively conducted by the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[Guttmacher Institute]], most unsafe abortions occur [[abortion law|where abortion is illegal]].<ref>{{Cite news

The [[Legalized abortion and crime effect|effect on crime of legalized abortion]] is a subject of controversy, with proponents of the theory generally arguing that "unwanted children" are more likely to become criminals and that an inverse correlation is observed between the availability of abortion and subsequent crime.<ref>{{cite book|last=Helfgott|first=Jacqueline B.|title=Criminal Behavior: Theories, Typolgies and Criminal Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kSUlHgB2m4C|year=2008|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-0487-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-kSUlHgB2m4C&pg=PA26n&dq=%22unwanted+children%22+crimials 26]}}</ref>

Economist [[George Akerlof]] has argued that the legalization of abortion in the United States contributed to a declining sense of paternal duty among biological fathers and to a decline in [[Shotgun wedding|shotgun weddings]], even when women chose childbirth over abortion, and thus to an increase rather than a decrease in the rate of children born to unwed mothers.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2946680 |last1=Akerlof |first1=George A. |last2=Yellen |first2=Janet |authorlink2=Janet Yellen |last3=Katz |first3=Lawrence F. |s2cid=11777041 |authorlink3=Lawrence F.

==Personhood==
There are differences of opinion as to whether a zygote/embryo/fetus [[Beginning of human personhood|acquires "personhood"]] or was always a "person".  If "personhood" is acquired, opinions differ about when this happens.

Traditionally, the concept of [[personhood]] entailed the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] concept referring to a non-corporeal or extra-corporeal dimension of [[human being]]. Today, the concepts of [[subjectivity]] and [[intersubjectivity]], [[person]]hood, [[mind]], and [[self]] have come to encompass a number of aspects of human being previously considered the domain of the "soul".<ref>[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], ''Sources of the Self: The Making of Modern Identity'', Harvard University Press, 1992.</ref><ref>[[Michel Foucault]], ''The Hermeneutics of the Subject'', New York: Picador, 2005.</ref> Thus, while the historical question has been: when does the [[ensoulment|soul enter the body]], in modern terms, the question could be put instead: at what point does the developing individual develop personhood or selfhood.<ref>The question could also be put historically. The concept of "personhood" is of fairly recent vintage, and cannot be found in the 1828 edition of  [http://1828.mshaffer.com/ 1828 edition of Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language], nor even as late as [http://machaut.uchicago.edu/websters 1913] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120710101105/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/websters |date=10 July 2012 }}. A search in dictionaries and encyclopedia for the term "personhood" generally redirects to "person". The American Heritage Dictionary at Yahoo has: "The state or condition of being a person, especially having those qualities that confer distinct individuality."</ref>

Since the zygote is genetically identical to the embryo, the fully formed fetus, and the baby, the notion of acquired personhood could lead to an instance of the [[Sorites paradox]], also known as ''the paradox of the heap''.<ref name="Sorites_JVI">{{cite journal|author1=Kerckhove, Lee F.|author2=Waller, Sara|title=Fetal Personhood and the Sorites Paradox|journal=The Journal of Value Inquiry|date=June 1998|volume=32|issue=2|pages=175–189|pmid=15295850|doi=10.1023/a:1004375726894|s2cid=37563125}}</ref>

===Fetal pain===
{{update|section|date=December 2011}}
The existence and implications of fetal pain are part of a larger debate about abortion.

Wendy Savage—press officer, Doctors for a Woman's Choice on Abortion—considers the question to be irrelevant.

===Fetal personhood===
{{Main|Beginning of human personhood}}
Although the two main sides of the abortion debate tend to agree that a human fetus is biologically and genetically human (that is, of the human species), they often differ in their view on whether or not a human fetus is, in any of various ways, a ''[[person]]''. Anti-abortion supporters argue that abortion is morally wrong on the basis that a fetus is an innocent [[human]] [[person]]<ref>Warren, 1973</ref> or because a fetus is a potential life that will, in most cases, develop into a fully functional human being.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.str.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=5187 |title=Creating a Potential Life? |first=Gregory |last=Koukl |year=1999 |work=Stand to Reason |access-date=22 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412093804/http://www.str.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=5187 |archive-date=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> They believe that a fetus is a person upon conception. Others reject this position by drawing a distinction between ''human being'' and ''human person'', arguing that while the fetus is ''innocent'' and ''biologically human'', it is not a ''person'' with a ''right to life''.<ref>Warren 1973: 457.  See also Tooley 1972: 40–43; Singer 2000: 126–28 and 155–156; and [[Consciousness#Consciousness as the basis of personal identity|John Locke]].  The term ''person'' may be used to denote a ''psychological'' property (being rational and self-conscious), a ''moral'' property (having a right to life), or both.</ref> In support of this distinction, some propose a list of criteria as markers of [[personhood]].  For example, [[Mary Ann Warren]] suggests [[consciousness]] (at least the capacity to feel pain), [[reasoning]], self-motivation, the ability to [[Communication|communicate]], and [[self-awareness]].<ref>Warren 1973: 458.</ref> According to Warren, a being need not exhibit all of these criteria to qualify as a person with a right to life, but if a being exhibits ''none'' of them (or perhaps only one), then it is certainly not a person.  Warren concludes that as the fetus satisfies only one criterion, consciousness (and this only after it becomes [[fetal pain|susceptible to pain]]),<ref>Warren 1973: 458–459</ref> the fetus is not a person and abortion is therefore morally permissible.  Other philosophers apply similar criteria, concluding that a fetus lacks a right to life because it lacks [[Neural oscillation|brain waves]] or higher brain function,<ref>{{Cite journal

Critics of this typically argue that some of the proposed criteria for personhood would disqualify two classes of ''born'' human beings – reversibly [[coma]]tose patients, and human infants – from having a right to life, since they, like fetuses, are not self-conscious, do not communicate, and so on.<ref>Marquis 1989: 197; Schwarz 1990: 89</ref> Defenders of the proposed criteria may respond that the reversibly comatose ''do'' satisfy the relevant criteria because they "retain all their ''unconscious'' mental states".<ref>Stretton 2004: 267, original emphasis; see also Singer 2000: 137; Boonin 2003: 64–70</ref> or at least some higher brain function (brain waves). Warren concedes that infants are not "persons" by her proposed criteria,<ref>Warren 1982</ref> and on that basis she and others, including the moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]], conclude that [[infanticide]] could be morally acceptable under some circumstances (for example if the infant is severely disabled<ref>Singer 2000: 186–193</ref> or in order to save the lives of several other infants.<ref>McMahan 2002: 359–360</ref>) Critics may see such concessions as an indication that the right to life cannot be adequately defined by reference to developed psychological features.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

An alternative approach is to base personhood or the right to life on a being's ''natural'' or ''inherent'' capacities.  On this approach, a being [[Essential property|essentially]] has a right to life if it has a ''natural capacity'' to develop the relevant psychological features; and, since human beings do have this natural capacity, they essentially have a right to life beginning at [[Conception (biology)|conception]] (or whenever they come into existence).<ref>Lee 1996 and 2004: Schwarz 1990: 91–93.</ref> Critics of this position argue that mere genetic potential is not a plausible basis for respect (or for the right to life), and that basing a right to life on natural capacities would lead to the counterintuitive position that [[anencephaly|anencephalic]] infants, irreversibly comatose patients, and brain-dead patients kept alive on a [[medical ventilator]], are all persons with a right to life.<ref>Stretton 2004: 274–281.</ref> Respondents to this criticism argue that the noted human cases in fact would not be classified as persons as they do not have a natural capacity to develop any psychological features.<ref>Schwarz 1990: 52.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prolifeadvocate.us/persnbw2.html |title=Christian Research Journal, Summer 1991, page 28 – When Does a Human Become a Person?|accessdate=18 February 2010 |last=Beckwith |first=Francis J. |year=1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Files/PDF/Center-for-Bioethics/conception.pdf |title=Ethics & Medicine, volume 19:1 – The conception view of personhood: a review |accessdate=1 April 2014 |last=Sullivan|first=Dennis M|year=2003}}</ref> Also, in a view that favors benefiting even unconceived but [[potential person|potential future persons]], it has been argued as justified to abort an [[unintended pregnancy]] in favor for conceiving a new child later in better conditions.<ref name="Savulescu2002">{{cite journal | last1 = Savulescu | first1 = J | year = 2002 | title = Abortion, embryo destruction and the future of value argument | journal = J Med Ethics | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 133–135 | doi = 10.1136/jme.28.3.133 | pmid = 12042393 | pmc = 1733572 }}</ref>
[[Image:Pro-Life Demonstration at Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|Members of [[Bound4LIFE]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] symbolically cover their mouths with red tape.]]

Philosophers such as [[Aquinas]] use the concept of [[individuation]]. They argue that abortion is not permissible from the point at which individual human identity is realized. [[Anthony Kenny]] argues that this can be derived from everyday beliefs and language and one can legitimately say "if my mother had had an abortion six months into her pregnancy, she would have killed me" then one can reasonably infer that at six months the "me" in question would have been an existing person with a valid claim to life. Since division of the zygote into twins through the process of [[twins|monozygotic twinning]] can occur until the fourteenth day of pregnancy, Kenny argues that individual identity is obtained at this point and thus abortion is not permissible after two weeks.<ref>A. Kenny, Reason and Religion: Essays in Philosophical Theology (Oxford: Basil Blackwell), 1987</ref>

===Arguments for abortion rights which do not depend on fetal non-personhood===

====Bodily rights====
An argument first presented by [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]] states that ''even if'' the fetus is a person and has a right to life, abortion is morally permissible because a woman has a right to control her own body and its life-support functions. Thomson's variant of this argument draws an analogy between forcing a woman to continue an unwanted pregnancy and forcing a person to allow his body to be used to maintain blood [[homeostasis]] (as a [[dialysis]] machine is used) for another person suffering from [[kidney failure]].  It is argued that just as it would be permissible to "unplug" and thereby cause the death of the person who is using one's kidneys, so it is permissible to abort the fetus (who similarly, it is said, has no right to use one's body's life-support functions against one's will).<ref name="Thomson_Defense">{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=Judith Jarvis|title=A Defense of Abortion|journal=Philosophy & Public Affairs|date=1971|volume=1|issue=1|quote=let me ask you to imagine this. You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, "Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you—we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you." Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation?|pages=47–66|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/Phil160,Fall02/thomson.htm|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref>

Critics of this argument generally argue that there are morally relevant disanalogies between abortion and the kidney failure scenario.  For example, it is argued that the fetus is the woman's child as opposed to a mere stranger;<ref>Schwarz 1990; McMahan 2002</ref> that abortion ''kills'' the fetus rather than merely letting it die;<ref>Schwarz 1990; McMahan 2002; Lee 1996</ref> and that in the case of pregnancy arising from voluntary intercourse, the woman has either tacitly consented to the fetus using her body,<ref>Warren 1973</ref> or has a duty to allow it to use her body since she herself is responsible for its need to use her body.<ref>McMahan 2002</ref> Some writers defend the analogy against these objections, arguing that the disanalogies are morally irrelevant or do not apply to abortion in the way critics have claimed.<ref>Boonin 2003: ch 4</ref>

Alternative scenarios have been put forth as more accurate and realistic representations of the moral issues present in abortion. [[John Noonan]] proposes the scenario of a family who was found to be liable for frostbite finger loss suffered by a dinner guest whom they refused to allow to stay overnight, although it was very cold outside and the guest showed signs of being sick. It is argued that just as it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation for the guest to protect him from physical harm, it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation of a fetus.<ref>''The Morality of abortion: legal and historical perspectives'' John T. Noonan, Harvard University Press, 1970 {{ISBN|0-674-58725-1}}</ref>

Other critics claim that there is a difference between artificial and extraordinary means of preservation, such as medical treatment, kidney dialysis, and blood transfusions, and normal and natural means of preservation, such as gestation, childbirth, and breastfeeding. They argue that if a baby was born into an environment in which there was no replacement available for her mother's breast milk, and the baby would either breastfeed or starve, the mother would have to allow the baby to breastfeed.  But the mother would never have to give the baby a blood transfusion, no matter what the circumstances were.  The difference between breastfeeding in that scenario and blood transfusions is the difference between using your body as a kidney dialysis machine, and gestation and childbirth.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.equipresources.org/atf/cf/%7B9C4EE03A-F988-4091-84BD-F8E70A3B0215%7D/JAA025.pdf |journal=Christian Research Journal |volume=30 |issue=4 |title=Suffer the violinist: Why the pro-abortion argument from bodily autonomy fails |accessdate=25 October 2009 |last=Poupard |first=Richard J |year=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Koukl G |author2=Klusendorf S |title=Making Abortion Unthinkable: The Art of Pro-Life Persuasion |publisher=STR Press |location=California |year=2001 |page=86}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Nathanson, Bernard |author2=Ostling, Richard |title=Aborting America |publisher=Double Day |location=Garden City |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-385-14461-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/abortingamerica00bern }}</ref><ref>{{cite video|people=Boonin, David|title="Is Abortion Morally Justifiable in a Free Society?"

====Freedom and equality====
Margaret Sanger wrote: "No woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother." From this perspective the right to abortion can be construed to be necessary in order for women to achieve equality with men whose freedom is not nearly so restricted by having children.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/mother/for_1.shtml#h4 | title=BBC - Ethics - Abortion: Arguments in favour of abortion}}</ref>

==== Impacts of criminalization ====
Some activists and academics, such as [[Andrea Smith (academic)|Andrea Smith]], argue that the criminalization of abortion furthers the marginalization of oppressed groups such as poor women and women of color. Sending these women into the prison system would do nothing to address the social/political/economic problems that marginalize these women or, sometimes, cause them to require abortions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Andrea|date=Spring 2005|title=Beyond Pro-Choice versus Pro-Life: Women of Color and Reproductive Justice|jstor=4317105|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=17|issue=1|pages=119–140|doi=10.2979/NWS.2005.17.1.119|citeseerx=10.1.1.552.2054|s2cid=3760837}}</ref>

'''Inefficacy of abortion bans on reducing abortion'''

Research has been conducted exploring whether banning abortion actually reduces abortion rates. Researchers from the Guttmacher Institute, the World Health Organization, and the University of Massachusetts concluded that, in countries where abortions were restricted, the number of unintended pregnancies increased and the proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion also increased.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bearak|first1=Jonathan|last2=Popinchalk|first2=Anna|last3=Ganatra|first3=Bela|last4=Moller|first4=Ann-Beth|last5=Tunçalp|first5=Özge|last6=Beavin|first6=Cynthia|last7=Kwok|first7=Lorraine|last8=Alkema|first8=Leontine|date=2020-09-01|title=Unintended pregnancy and abortion by income, region, and the legal status of abortion: estimates from a comprehensive model for 1990–2019|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30315-6/abstract|journal=The Lancet Global Health|language=English|volume=8|issue=9|pages=e1152–e1161|doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30315-6|issn=2214-109X|pmid=32710833}}</ref> The following table taken from their research shows these findings in greater detail:

====Abortion safety====

Even where abortions are illegal, some do take place. However, they are generally done unsafely, both because the need for secrecy tends to be more important than the woman's safety, and due to the lack of training and experience the doctor performing the abortion. When done correctly by properly trained doctors, abortion is generally safe.

===Arguments against abortion===

Abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion.

====Discrimination====
The book ''Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation'' presents the argument that abortion involves unjust [[discrimination]] against the unborn.  According to this argument, those who deny that fetuses have a right to life do not value ''all'' human life, but instead, select arbitrary characteristics (such as particular levels of physical or psychological development) as giving some human beings more value or rights than others.<ref>"Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation" (1983), by Ronald Reagan, William P. Clark, Brian P. Johnston, [[Wanda Franz]]. New Regency Pub, {{ISBN|0-9641125-3-1}}</ref>

In contrast, philosophers who define the right to life by reference to particular levels of physical or psychological development typically maintain that such characteristics are morally relevant,<ref>Singer 2000: 217–18; McMahan 2002: 242–3; Boonin 2003: 126</ref> and reject the assumption that all human life necessarily has value (or that membership in the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is in itself morally relevant).<ref>, Singer 2000: 221–2; McMahan 2002: 214; Boonin 2003: 25</ref>

====Deprivation====
{{further|Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate#The deprivation argument}}
The argument of deprivation states that abortion is morally wrong because it deprives the fetus of a valuable future.<ref>Marquis 1989.  See also Stone 1987.</ref> On this account, killing an ''adult'' human being is wrong because it deprives the victim of a ''future like ours''—a future containing highly valuable or desirable experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments.<ref>Marquis 1989: 189–190</ref> If a being has such a future, then (according to the argument) killing that being would seriously harm it and hence would be seriously wrong.<ref>Marquis 1989: 190.  The type of wrongness appealed to here is presumptive or [[prima facie]] wrongness: it may be overridden in exceptional circumstances.</ref> But since a fetus does have such a future, the "overwhelming majority" of deliberate abortions are placed in the "same moral category" as killing an innocent adult human being.<ref>Marquis 1989: 183.</ref> Not ''all'' abortions are unjustified according to this argument: abortion would be justified if the same justification could be applied to killing an adult human.

Criticism of this line of reasoning follows several threads.  Some reject the argument on grounds relating to [[personal identity]], holding that the fetus is ''not the same entity'' as the adult into which it will develop, and thus that the fetus does not have a "future like ours" in the required sense.<ref>McMahan 2002: ch 1.</ref> Others grant that the fetus has a future like ours, but argue that being deprived of this future is not a significant harm or a significant wrong to the fetus, because there are relatively few ''psychological connections'' (continuations of memory, belief, desire and the like) between the fetus as it is now and the adult into which it will develop.<ref>McMahan 2002: 271; Stretton 2004: 171–179</ref> Another criticism is that the argument creates inequalities in the wrongness of killing:<ref>Stretton 2004: 250–260; see also McMahan 2002: 234–235 and 271</ref> as the futures of some people appear to be far more valuable or desirable than the futures of other people, the argument appears to entail that some killings are far more ''wrong'' than others, or that some people have a far stronger ''right to life'' than others—a conclusion that is taken to be counterintuitive or unacceptable.

====Argument from uncertainty====
Some anti-abortion supporters argue that if there is uncertainty as to whether the fetus has a right to life, then having an abortion is equivalent to consciously taking the risk of killing another.  According to this argument, if it is not known for certain whether something (such as the fetus) has a right to life, then it is reckless and morally wrong to treat that thing as if it ''lacks'' a right to life (for example by killing it).<ref>Schwarz 1990: 58–9; Beckwith 2007: 60–1; ''Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation'' (1983), by Ronald Reagan, William P. Clark, Brian P. Johnston, Wanda Franz. New Regency Pub, {{ISBN|0-9641125-3-1}}</ref> This would place abortion in the same moral category as [[manslaughter]] (if it turns out that the fetus has a right to life) or certain forms of [[criminal negligence]] (if it turns out that the fetus does not have a right to life).<ref>
''Three approaches to abortion'' (2002), by Peter Kreeft, {{ISBN|0-89870-915-6}}
</ref>

David Boonin replies that if this kind of argument were correct, then the killing of nonhuman animals and plants would also be morally wrong, because (Boonin contends) it is not known for certain that such beings lack a right to life.<ref>Boonin 2003: 314–15</ref> Boonin also argues that arguments from uncertainty fail because the mere fact that one might be mistaken in finding certain arguments persuasive (for example, arguments for the claim that the fetus lacks a right to life) does not mean that one should act contrary to those arguments or assume them to be mistaken.<ref>Boonin 2003: 323</ref>

====Slippery slope ====

One argument used by anti-abortion activists is the [[slippery slope argument]], that normalising and legalising abortion might lead to further killing through [[euthanasia]].<ref>

A number of opinion polls around the world have explored public opinion regarding the issue of abortion. Results have varied from poll to poll, country to country, and region to region, while varying with regard to different aspects of the issue.

A May 2005 survey examined attitudes toward abortion in 10 European countries, asking respondents whether they agreed with the statement, "If a woman doesn't want children, she should be allowed to have an abortion". The highest level of approval was 81% (in the Czech Republic); the lowest was 47% (in Poland).<ref>TNS Sofres. (May 2005).

====Effect upon crime rate====
{{Main|Legalized abortion and crime effect}}

A theory attempts to draw a correlation between the United States' unprecedented nationwide decline of the overall crime rate during the 1990s and the decriminalization of abortion 20 years prior.

The suggestion was brought to widespread attention by a 1999 academic paper, ''[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]]'', authored by the economists [[Steven Levitt|Steven D. Levitt]] and John Donohue. They attributed the drop in crime to a reduction in individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes: unwanted children, especially those born to mothers who are African American, impoverished, [[teenage pregnancy|adolescent]], uneducated, and [[single parent|single]]. The change coincided with what would have been the adolescence, or peak years of potential criminality, of those who had not been born as a result of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and similar cases. Donohue and Levitt's study also noted that states which legalized abortion before the rest of the nation experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier, and those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions.<ref>{{Cite journal |first1=John J. |last1=Donohue |date=May 2001|title=The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=379–420 |doi=10.1162/00335530151144050 |last2=Levitt |first2=Steven D.|title-link=The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime }}</ref>

Fellow economists Christopher Foote and Christopher Goetz criticized the methodology in the Donohue-Levitt study, noting a lack of accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as cocaine use, and recalculating based on incidence of crime per capita; they found no [[statistically significant]] results.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Foote |first1=Christopher L. |date=February 2008|title=The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime: Comment |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=407–423 |doi=10.1162/qjec.2008.123.1.407 |last2=Goetz |first2=Christopher F.|citeseerx=10.1.1.575.497 }}</ref> Levitt and Donohue responded to this by presenting an adjusted [[data set]] which took into account these concerns and reported that the data maintained the statistical significance of their initial paper.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Donohue |first1=John J. |date=February 2008|title=Measurement Error, Legalized Abortion, and the Decline in Crime: A Response to Foote and Goetz |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=425–440 |doi=10.1162/qjec.2008.123.1.425 |last2=Levitt |first2=Steven D.|s2cid=11532713 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w11987.pdf }}</ref>

In early pregnancy, levels of [[estrogen]] increase, leading to breast growth in preparation for [[lactation]]. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion&nbsp;– before full maturity in the third trimester&nbsp;– then more relatively vulnerable immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. The hypothesis mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.<ref name="RUSSO">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Russo J, Russo IH |title=Susceptibility of the mammary gland to carcinogenesis.

==== Minors ====
{{Main|Minors and abortion}}
Many states require some form of parental consent before an abortion is set to happen. In the United States, 37 states require the parent to have knowledge while only 21 of those states need one parent to consent.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/parental-involvement-minors-abortions|title=Parental Involvement in Minors' Abortions|date=2016-03-14|work=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}</ref> Certain states have an alternative answer to the involvement of the parent by getting the judicial system involved with a judicial bypass. In those states, minors can get permission from the judge if parents are not willing to do so or if they are absent from their lives.<ref name=":0" />

These laws are known as [[Parental involvement (abortion)|parental involvement]] laws.

There are different guidelines for minors and abortions in every country. In most of Europe, all persons that are capable of judgment enjoy [[medical privacy]] and can decide medical matters on their own. The capability of judgment does not come at a defined age, however, and is dependent on how well the person is able to understand the decision and its consequences. For most medical procedures, the capability of judgment usually sets in at ages 12 to 14.
