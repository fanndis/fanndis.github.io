==History==
{{See also|Maryland Gazette}}
The newspaper was founded in 1884 as the ''Evening Capital'' and operated under this name until June 20, 1981, when it was shortened to just ''The Capital''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88065721/|title=About Evening capital.|website=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=7 September 2018}}</ref> Its founder was William M. Abbott, a former compositor for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', who employed his daughter Emma Abbott Gage as the newspaper's editor and his son Charles B. Abbott as business manager.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/77547383/emma-gage|title=Emma Abbott Gage|website=Find A Grave|access-date=7 September 2018}}</ref> In 1910, Abbott purchased the weekly ''[[Maryland Gazette]]'' from Col. Phillip E. Porter and merged the paper with his ''Capital'', creating the ''Evening Capital and Maryland Gazette''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88065726/|title=About Evening capital and Maryland gazette.|website=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=7 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-capital-history-20180628-story.html|title=Capital Gazette newspapers in Annapolis trace their origins to 1727|last=Kaltenbach|first=Chris|date=28 June 2018|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=7 September 2018}}</ref>

In the years following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Annapolis faded economically, and the pages of the ''Evening Capital'' mostly reflected the local happenings of a sleepy, provincial town.<ref>{{Cite book|title=And to Bed: Being a Brief History of the Maryland Gazette|last=Jackson, Jr.|first=Elmer Martin|publisher=Capital-Gazette Press|year=1936|location=Annapolis}}</ref> During the early twentieth century, the expansion of the nearby [[United States Naval Academy]] was recorded in the paper as a source of both optimism and concern for local citizens.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Annapolis|last=Jackson, Jr.|first=Elmer Martin|publisher=Capital-Gazette Press|year=1962|location=Annapolis}}</ref> Abbott and his family handed over ownership of the paper to Ridgely P. Melvin in 1919, and it reverted to its original name of ''Evening Capital'' in 1922.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83009667/|title=About Evening capital.|website=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=7 September 2018}}</ref> Melvin subsequently sold the ''Capital'' to the Capital-Gazette Press Company in 1926.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Two Hundred Years with the Maryland Gazette, 1727-1927|last1=Christian|first1=Charles M.|last2=Christian|first2=Thomas L.|publisher=Capital-Gazette Press|year=1927|location=Annapolis}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9NJzbC_mlpkC&q=Annapolis,+City+on+the+Severn:+A+History.|title=Annapolis, City on the Severn: A History|last=McWilliams|first=Jane Wilson|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0801896590|location=Baltimore}}</ref>

For much of the twentieth century, the ''Capital'' was edited by Elmer Jackson, Jr., who had been appointed in 1931.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21412801/elmer_jackson_named_editor/|title=Elmer Jackson named editor|date=6 May 1931|work=The Daily Mail|location=Hagerstown, Maryland}}</ref> In 1959, it added a Saturday morning edition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21397310/evening_paper_will_publish_sat_mornings/|title=Evening paper will publish Sat. mornings|work=The Daily Mail|location=Hagerstown, Maryland}}</ref>

In 1967, the newspaper and its sisters were sold to [[Philip Merrill]] and [[Landmark Media Enterprises|Landmark Communications]], who shared ownership.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/26/archives/elmer-m-jackson-3d-dies-t-editor-of-maryland-paper.html|title=Elmer M.

Its change to a seven-day-a-week morning paper was announced on February 8, 2015, and implemented on March 9.<ref name="sgunncapital" />

As of 2018, ''The Capital'' had a daily circulation of about 33,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mondotimes.com/1/world/us/20/1130/2681|title=Annapolis Capital Gazette|website=Mondo Times|publisher=Mondo Times}}</ref> The papers are printed on a computerized high-speed [[Goss International]] Headliner press.
