"'''Ronan'''" is a [[Charity record|charity single]] released on September 8, 2012, by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] to the [[iTunes Store]]. Swift's lyrics are based on a [[blog]] by Maya Thompson about her four-year-old boy Ronan, who died from [[neuroblastoma]] in 2011.<ref name="toc9-7-2012">{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-stand-up-to-cancer-ronan/|title=Taylor Swift to 'Stand Up to Cancer' With Song for 4-Year-Old Lost to Neuroblastoma|author=Megan Pacella|date=September 7, 2012|work=Taste of Country|accessdate=September 7, 2012}}</ref> Swift wrote and produced the song by putting together quotes from the blog, crediting Maya Thompson as co-writer. All proceeds from sales of the single go to help fight cancer.

==Background==
Swift wrote the song after reading Maya Thompson's blog. Thompson is the mother of four-year-old Ronan Thompson, who died in 2011 of neuroblastoma.<ref name="toc9-7-2012" /> He had been treated at [[Barrow Neurological Institute at Phoenix Children's]] Hospital. Maya began writing in August 2010 when Ronan was diagnosed and she continued penning her entries in the blog ''Rockstar Ronan'' during the nine months that Ronan suffered from the illness before dying in May 2011, just three days before his fourth birthday. Maya worked through her grief by continuing the blog, writing heartbreaking letters to her late son whilst raising money and awareness for childhood cancer causes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=27193 |title=Ronan by Taylor Swift Songfacts |website=Songfacts.com |date=September 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref>

The pair met in October 2011, when Swift invited Maya to her concert at the [[Jobing.com Arena]] in Glendale, Arizona. She wrote about her reaction when Taylor told her that she'd penned the song inspired by her blog entries, "My calmness soon turned to complete and utter frozen shock when these words came out of her mouth. 'I wrote a song for Ronan.'" Thompson added, addressing her late son, "'The tears started pouring down my cheeks as soon as I heard her say those words. But her words didn't stop there. Not only did she write a song for you, but she wanted to know if it would be alright to perform it on the nationally televised show."<ref name="Hey Maya, it's Taylor Swift">{{cite web|url=http://rockstarronan.com/2012/09/09/hey-maya-its-taylor-swift|title=Hey Maya, it's Taylor Swift...|website=Rockstaronan.com|accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref> Swift credits Thompson as the co-writer of the song. It was released to the US [[iTunes Store]] shortly after the Stand Up to Cancer [[telethon]] ended, and all proceeds of the single go towards cancer charities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.msn.com/music/article.aspx?news=755896&GT1=28102|title=Taylor Swift to debut song for cancer victim|date=September 7, 2012|work=[[MSN]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=September 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213223821/http://music.msn.com/music/article.aspx?news=755896&GT1=28102|archive-date=December 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>
