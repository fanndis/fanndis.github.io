It has formed [[coalition government]]s with both major political parties in New Zealand: first with the National Party from 1996 to 1998 and then with the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] from 2005 to 2008 and from 2017 to 2020. Peters has served on two occasions as [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|deputy prime minister]].

New Zealand First takes a [[centrism|centrist]] position on [[economic policy|economic issues]] and a [[social conservatism|social-conservative]] position on social issues such as [[criminal justice]]. The party distinguishes itself from the mainstream [[political establishment]] through its use of populist rhetoric, and supports popular [[referendums in New Zealand|referenda]]. It has also advocated [[Opposition to immigration|restrictive immigration-policies]].

The party entered the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] shortly after its formation in 1993. New Zealand First had 17 [[members of parliament]] (MPs) at its peak, following the first [[mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] election in [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996]]. It left parliament following the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 election]] in which it failed to gain enough [[party vote]]s to retain representation. However, in the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 election]], New Zealand First gained 6.59% of the total party vote, entitling it to eight MPs. The party increased its number of MPs to eleven at the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014 election]]. During the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 election]], the party's number of MPs dropped to nine members.<ref name="2017 election">{{cite web|title= 2017 General Election – Official Result|url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/|publisher= [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand) |New Zealand Electoral Commission]]|accessdate= 7 October 2017}}</ref> In the weeks following the 2017 election, New Zealand First formed a [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|coalition government with the Labour Party]].<ref name="NZ First Labour coalition">

Winston Peters has on several occasions characterised the rate of [[Asian New Zealanders|Asian]] immigration into New Zealand as too high; in 2004, he stated: "We are being dragged into the status of an Asian colony and it is time that New Zealanders were placed first in their own country".<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/winston-peters-memorable-quotes/2005/10/18/1129401225653.html "Winston Peters' memorable quotes"], ''The Age'', 18 October 2005</ref> On 26 April 2005, he said: "Māori will be disturbed to know that in 17 years' time they will be outnumbered by Asians in New Zealand", an estimate disputed by [[Statistics New Zealand]], the government's statistics bureau, which stated that with a 145 % increase from 270,000 to 670,000, the Asian community would still be smaller in 2021 than the Māori, who would increase by 5% to 760,000 over the same timeframe. Peters quickly rebutted that Statistics New Zealand has underestimated the growth rate of the Asian community in the past, as the Bureau had corrected its estimation by a 66,000 increase between 2003 and 2005.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10122478">{{cite web |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10122478 |title=Peter's Asian warning |author=Berry, Ruth |date=27 April 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=4 October 2011}}</ref> In April 2008, deputy leader [[Peter Brown (New Zealand politician)|Peter Brown]] drew widespread attention after voicing similar views and expressing concern at the growth of New Zealand's ethnic Asian population: "If we continue this open door policy there is real danger we will be inundated with people who have no intention of integrating into our society … They will form their own mini-societies to the detriment of integration and that will lead to division, friction and resentment".<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian population growth shows inundation danger&nbsp;– MP|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/343754/Asian-population-growth-shows-inundation-danger-MP|accessdate=23 August 2017|work=Stuff|date=31 January 2009}}</ref>

New Zealand First also espouses a mixture of economic policies.

===Relations with Māori===
Winston Peters is part-[[Māori people|Māori]]; the party once held all [[Māori electorates]] (see [[Tight Five]]), and it continues to receive significant support from voters registered in Māori electorates. However, New Zealand First no longer supports the retention of the Māori electorates and has declared that it will not stand candidates in the Māori electorates in the future. It did not stand candidates in the Māori electorates in the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002]], [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]], or [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tōrangapū&nbsp;– Māori and political parties&nbsp;– National, New Zealand First, Māori and Mana parties |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/torangapu-maori-and-political-parties/page-4 |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=7 August 2013 |date=13 July 2012}}</ref>

New Zealand First is further characterised by its strong stance on the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].<ref name="Hayward"/> The party refers to the Treaty as a "source of national pride" but does not support it becoming a part of [[constitution of New Zealand|constitutional law]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Policies {{!}} Maori Affairs|url=http://www.nzfirst.org.nz/maori_affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231012104/http://www.nzfirst.org.nz/maori_affairs|url-status=dead|archive-date=31 December 2016|publisher=New Zealand First|accessdate=20 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> Peters has criticised what he refers to as a Treaty "Grievance Industry"—which profits from making frivolous claims of violations of the Treaty—and the cost of Treaty negotiations and [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|settlement]] payments.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peters|first1=Winston|title=Treaty of Waitangi as it was and should be|url=http://www.nzfirst.org.nz/rt_hon_winston_peters_speech_the_treaty_of_waitangi_as_it_was_and_should_be|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406094713/http://www.nzfirst.org.nz/rt_hon_winston_peters_speech_the_treaty_of_waitangi_as_it_was_and_should_be|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 April 2017|publisher=New Zealand First|accessdate=20 June 2017|date=4 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Aimee|first1=Gulliver|title='Colossal, unjustified' payments to Treaty negotiators|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/71018444/colossal-unjustified-payments-to-treaty-negotiators|accessdate=20 June 2017|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=11 August 2015|language=en}}</ref> The party has called for an end to "special treatment" of Māori.<ref>{{cite news|title=Peters unveils NZ First treaty policy|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10332036|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=22 June 2005|language=en-NZ}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation===
[[File:WinstonPetersEuropa.jpg|thumb|[[Winston Peters]] founded the party in 1993]]
In June 1992, National Party Member of Parliament for [[Tauranga (New Zealand electorate)|Tauranga]], [[Winston Peters]], was told that he would not be allowed to run under National's banner in the [[1993 New Zealand general election|1993 election]].<ref name="Gulliver">{{cite news|last1=Gulliver|first1=Aimee|title=Timeline: Winston Peters and Northland|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/66748067/timeline-winston-peters-and-northland|accessdate=16 June 2017|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=NZ Party Moves To Expel Peters|first=David|last=Barber|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|page=13|date=12 June 1992}}</ref> A former [[Minister of Māori Affairs]], Peters had previously been dismissed from the Cabinet in 1991, after he publicly criticised National Party policy.<ref name="Gulliver"/>

===1993 general election===
[[File:New Zealand First logo.png|thumb|Original party logo (1993–2017)]]
In the April 1993 [[1993 Tauranga by-election|special by-election]], Tauranga voters re-elected Peters as an independent. At the general election six months later, New Zealand First received 8.4% of the total vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/events/past-events/general-elections-1890-1993 |title=GENERAL ELECTIONS 1890-1993 |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] |date=30 August 2016 |accessdate=10 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230122414/http://www.elections.org.nz/events/past-events/general-elections-1890-1993 |archive-date=30 December 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Peters easily retained Tauranga, and [[Tau Henare]], another New Zealand First candidate, won the Northern Māori seat, giving the party a total of two MPs. This did much to counter the perception of New Zealand First as merely a personality-driven vehicle for Peters.

===1996 general election===
With the switch to the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) electoral system for the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]], smaller parties could gain a share of seats proportional to their share of the vote. This enabled New Zealand First to win 13% of the vote and 17 seats, including all five [[Māori seats]]. New Zealand First's five Māori MPs—Henare (the party's deputy leader), [[Tuku Morgan]], [[Rana Waitai]], [[Tu Wyllie]] and [[Tuariki Delamere]]—became known as the "[[Tight Five]]".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sullivan |first1=Ann |title=Tōrangapū – Māori and political parties - National, New Zealand First, Māori and Mana parties |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/torangapu-maori-and-political-parties/page-4 |publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=29 August 2019 |date=18 July 2016}}</ref>

The election result put New Zealand First in a powerful position just three years after its formation. Neither of the two traditional major parties (National and [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]) had enough seats to govern alone, and only New Zealand First had enough seats to become a realistic coalition partner for either. This placed the relatively new party in a position where it could effectively choose the next [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]].

New Zealand First entered into negotiations with both major parties. Before the election, most people (including many New Zealand First voters) had expected Peters to enter into coalition with Labour. In fact, he harshly attacked his former National colleagues during the campaign, and appeared to promise that he would not even consider going into coalition with them.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sachdeva |first1=Sam |title=Reading the tea leaves from 1996 |url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2017/07/29/40392/reading-the-tea-leaves-from-1996 |website=[[Newsroom (website)|Newsroom]] |accessdate=30 August 2019 |language=en-AU |date=30 July 2017}}</ref>

===Coalition with National, 1996–1998===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
However, to the surprise of the electorate, which had apparently voted for New Zealand First to get rid of National, Peters decided to enter a coalition ''with'' National, enabling and becoming part of the third term of the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|fourth National government]]. The most common explanation for this decision involved National's willingness to accept New Zealand First's demands (and/or Labour's refusal to do so). However, [[Michael Laws]] (a former National Party MP who served as a New Zealand First campaign manager) claims that Peters had secretly decided to go with National significantly before this time, and that he merely used negotiations with Labour to encourage more concessions from National.

Whatever the case, New Zealand First exacted a high price from incumbent Prime Minister [[Jim Bolger]] in return for allowing him to stay in power. Under the terms of a detailed coalition agreement, Peters would serve as [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]], and would also hold the specially created office of Treasurer (senior to the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]]). The National Party also made considerable concessions on policy.

New Zealand First had a relatively smooth coalition relationship with National at first. Despite early concerns about the ability of Peters to work with Bolger, who had sacked Peters from a former National cabinet, the two did not have major problems.

New Zealand First had graver concerns about the behaviour of some of its MPs, whom opponents accused of incompetence and extravagant spending. Many people came to the conclusion that the party's minor MPs had come into parliament merely to provide votes for Peters, and would not make any real contributions themselves. A particularly damaging scandal involved [[Tuku Morgan]].

Gradually, however, the coalition tensions became more significant than problems of party discipline. This became increasingly the case after Transport Minister [[Jenny Shipley]] gained enough support within the National caucus to force Bolger's resignation and become Prime Minister (8 December 1997). The tensions between the two parties also rose as New Zealand First adopted a more aggressive approach to promoting its policies (including those that National would not implement). This new attitude probably fed off New Zealand First's poor performance in opinion polls, which (to Peters) indicated that the party's success rested on its confrontational style. Many commentators believe that Peters performs better in [[Parliamentary opposition|opposition]] than in Government.

===Return to opposition===
On 14 August 1998, Shipley sacked Peters from Cabinet. This occurred after an ongoing dispute about the sale of the government's stake in Wellington International Airport.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10529769 |title=Once, twice, three times a break-up |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2018 }}</ref>

Peters immediately broke off the coalition with National. However, several other MPs, unwilling to follow Peters out of government, tried to replace Peters with Henare. This caucus-room coup failed, and most of these MPs joined Henare in forming a new party, [[Mauri Pacific]], while others established themselves as independents. Many of these MPs had come under public scrutiny for their behaviour. Until 1999, however, they provided National with enough support to continue without New Zealand First.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

===1999 general election===
In the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] New Zealand First lost much of its support, receiving only 4% of the party vote.<ref>{{cite web |title=Summary of Overall Results |url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_1999/e9/html/e9_partI.html |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=22 April 2018 }}</ref> Some voters had apparently not forgiven Peters for forming a coalition with National after being led to believe that a vote for him would help get rid of National. Under New Zealand's MMP rules, a party must either win an electorate seat or 5% of the vote to have seats in parliament. Peters held his Tauranga seat by a mere 63 votes, and New Zealand First received five seats in total.<ref>{{cite web |title=Winning Electorate Candidate Votes |url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_1999/e9/html/e9_partVI.html |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>

===2002 general election===
By the [[2002 New Zealand general election|election of 2002]], however, the party had rebuilt much of its support. This occurred largely because of Peters' three-point campaign for sensible immigration, scrutinising Treaty costs, and reducing crime.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The party won 10.38% of the vote, which was a considerable improvement on its previous performance (although not as good as its performance in 1996), and New Zealand First won thirteen seats in parliament.<ref name="2002 election">{{cite web |title=Official Count Results – Overall Status |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2002/partystatus.html |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> Peters' campaign slogan "Can We Fix It?

It appears that New Zealand First had hoped to play in 2002 a similar role to the one it had in 1996, where it found itself able to give power to either Labour or National depending on which offered the best deal. However, National's vote had collapsed to the extent that it could not form a government even with New Zealand First's support, depriving the party of its negotiating advantage. In the end, however, this proved irrelevant, as Labour refused to consider an alliance with New Zealand First in any case. Instead, Labour relied on support from the newly significant [[United Future New Zealand|United Future]] Party.

After the 2002 election, in light of National's decreased strength, New Zealand First attempted to gain more prominence in Opposition, frequently attacking the Labour Coalition government on a wide range of issues. Speculation has occurred on efforts to create a more united front linking New Zealand First, National, and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]], but Peters has rejected this scenario, saying that the New Zealand voters will decide what alliances are necessary (even though New Zealand never votes directly on preferred coalitions). Unlike ACT, which portrays itself as a natural coalition partner for National, New Zealand First welcomes coalition with any major party, regardless of the political spectrum.

For a period in early 2004 New Zealand First experienced a brief decline in the polls after [[Don Brash]] became leader of the National Party, a change which hugely revived National's fortunes. The votes that had apparently switched to New Zealand First from National seemed to return to support Brash, and many commentators predicted that New Zealand First would lose a number of its seats in the next election. By 2005, however, the proportions had changed again, and as the campaign for the September 2005 election got under way, New Zealand First had again reached the 10% mark in political polling.

Pre-election polls put New Zealand First ahead of the other minor parties. Some thought it likely that in the event of a National minority, unless ACT's fortunes dramatically improved, Brash would have to form a second coalition or seek a support agreement with New Zealand First to be able to form a government. Peters promised to support the party that won the most seats, or at least abstain in [[Motion of no confidence|no-confidence motions]] against it. However, he also said he would not support any government that included the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]] within the Cabinet.

===Confidence and supply with Labour: 2005–2008===
In the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 election]], however, the smaller political parties (including New Zealand First) suffered a severe mauling. Though it remained the third-largest party in the House, New Zealand First took only 5.72% of the vote, a considerable loss from 2002, and just enough to cross the MMP proportionality quota of 5%. In addition, Peters narrowly lost his previously [[safe seat|safe constituency seat]] of [[Tauranga (New Zealand electorate)|Tauranga]] by 730 votes to National's [[Bob Clarkson]], and became a [[list MP]].

New Zealand First had seven MPs, all elected on the party list: Peters, [[Peter Brown (New Zealand politician)|Peter Brown]], [[Dail Jones]], [[Ron Mark]], [[Doug Woolerton]], [[Barbara Stewart]] and [[Pita Paraone]].

Following the 2005 election, New Zealand First agreed to a [[confidence and supply|supply-and-confidence]] agreement with the Labour Party (along with [[United Future]]) in return for policy concessions and the post of [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|Foreign Minister]] (outside [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]]) for Peters. Some reaction<ref>For example: section "Baublewatch" in Audrey Young: [https://archive.today/20120907200130/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10357120 "PM marks Peters' report with 'pretty good effort'"] in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', 26 November 2005.

to Peters' becoming Minister of Foreign Affairs detected a change in his attitude since Peters' "Rotorua speech" on 7 September 2005 at a public address at the Rotorua Convention Centre, which had spoken of sitting on the [[crossbenches|cross-benches]] (and thus staying out of government) and eschewing "the baubles of office".

Soon after the 2005 election Peters launched a legal challenge against Clarkson. The case alleged that Clarkson had spent more than the legal limit allowed for campaign budgets during elections in New Zealand. This legal bid failed, with a majority of the judges in the case declaring that Clarkson had not overspent.

In the [[2005 New Zealand election funding controversy|2005 election funding controversy]], the [[Office of the Controller and Auditor-General|Auditor-General]] found that all the parties in parliament except the [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressive Party]] had misspent parliamentary funding. New Zealand First was the only party that did not repay the misspent funding.<ref>{{cite web | title=Charity turns down NZ First's donation | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10516988 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120906114712/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10516988 | url-status=dead | archive-date=6 September 2012 | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=18 June 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2009}}</ref>

In the months before the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]], New Zealand First became embroiled in a dispute over donations to the party from [[Owen Glenn]], the Vela family and [[Bob Jones (businessman)|Bob Jones]]. This resulted in an investigation into party finances by the [[Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)|Serious Fraud Office]] on 28 August 2008 and an investigation into Peters by the Privileges Committee.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10529553&pnum=0 |title=Winston Peters&nbsp;– Going, going ... |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=29 August 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> On 29 August 2008 Peters stood down from his ministerial roles while the investigations were ongoing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Peters 'hurt but calm' in stepping down |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10529612 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120904225534/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10529612 |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 September 2012 |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=14 September 2008}}</ref> Although the Serious Fraud Office and the police found that Peters was not guilty of any wrongdoing, the episode harmed Peters and the party in the lead-up to the election.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10541195">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-election-2008/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501799&objectid=10541195 |title=Police inquiry clears NZ First |author=Claire Trevett and Patrick Gower |date=5 November 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>

On election night it was clear that Peters had not regained Tauranga and that the party had not met the 5% threshold needed for parties to be elected without an electorate seat. In what some journalists described as a 'gracious' concession speech, Peters said that 'it's not over yet. We'll reorganise ourselves in the next few months. And we'll see what 2011 might hold for all us.'<ref name="NZ_Herald_10541945">{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-election-2008/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501799&objectid=10541945 |title=Winston Peters: Gone but never forgotten |last=Gower |first= Patrick |date=9 November 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>

===2011 general election===
At the beginning of the election campaign New Zealand First was polling at around 2% in most major polls and was effectively written off by most political commentators. Prime Minister [[John Key]] had ruled out working with Peters and New Zealand First, however Opposition Leader [[Phil Goff]] had stated he was open to working with New Zealand First post-election provided they made it back into Parliament.

Peters received a significant amount of media attention towards the end of the campaign at the height of the [[Tea Tape scandal]] which arose during the campaign. Peters had criticised the arrangement in the seat of Epsom between National and ACT in which National encouraged its supporters to vote for the ACT candidate for their electorate MP and railed against National for alleged remarks made about the then ACT leader Don Brash and New Zealand First's elderly supporters.

Peters appeared on a TVNZ minor parties leaders debate and won the debate convincingly in the subsequent text poll, with 36% of the respondents saying Peters had won.

New Zealand First won 6.6% of the party vote on election night.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz|title=NEW ZEALAND ELECTION RESULTS|first=New Zealand Electoral|last=Commission|website=electionresults.govt.nz}}</ref> Many political experts credit the Tea Tape Scandal for the re-entry of New Zealand First into Parliament; however, Peters himself credits the return to Parliament to the hard work undertaken by the Party over the three years it was not represented in Parliament.

In 2012 the party sacked MP [[Brendan Horan]] after allegations he stole money from his dying mother to gamble.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Horan-admits-144-TAB-calls/tabid/1607/articleID/279879/Default.aspx | work= 3 News NZ | title= Horan admits 144 TAB calls | date= 10 December 2012 | access-date= 22 April 2013 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130209055631/http://www.3news.co.nz/Horan-admits-144-TAB-calls/tabid/1607/articleID/279879/Default.aspx | archive-date= 9 February 2013 | url-status= dead | df= dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2012, New Zealand First stated their intent to work in coalition with parties that would buy the privatised state assets back after the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014 general election]].<ref name="state assets">{{cite news|title=NZ First Committed To Buying Back State-Owned Assets {{!}} Scoop News|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1206/S00276/nz-first-committed-to-buying-back-state-owned-assets.htm|accessdate=16 June 2017|publisher=scoop.co.nz|date=20 June 2012}}</ref>

New Zealand First entered the 2014 general election campaign without providing a clear indication as to their coalition preferences.

New Zealand First increased its party vote to 8.66% at the election, which took the party's representation in Parliament to 11 seats. Peters was highly critical of the conduct of the [[Labour Party of New Zealand|Labour]] and [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green]] parties, who he blamed for the Opposition's loss.<ref>[https://archive.today/20140920232307/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11328808]</ref>

In 2015 Peters contested the [[2015 Northland by-election|Northland by-election]], which was held as a result of the resignation of the incumbent [[Mike Sabin]] on 30 January 2015 amid allegations of assault. Peters won the traditionally safe National seat with a majority of 4,441 over the National candidate Mark Osborne. It was the first time a New Zealand First MP held an electorate seat since Peters lost [[Tauranga (New Zealand electorate)|Tauranga]] in 2005. The win also resulted in New Zealand First acquiring a new List MP, [[Ria Bond]], which increased the party's parliamentary representation to 12 seats.

On 3 July 2015 [[Ron Mark]] was elected Deputy Leader of New Zealand First, replacing [[Tracey Martin]] who had held the post since 2013.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Nicholas |title=Ron Mark new NZ First deputy leader |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11475210 |accessdate=3 July 2015 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=3 July 2015}}</ref>

During the party's convention in South Auckland on 16 July, Peters vowed that a New Zealand First government would hold two binding referendums on whether Maori electorates should be abolished and whether the number of MPs should be reduced to 100. Other New Zealand First policies included reducing immigration to 10,000 a year (from 72,300 in the June 2017 year),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/Migration/IntTravelAndMigration_MRJun17.aspx|title=International Travel and Migration: June 2017|website=stats.govt.nz}}</ref> and nationalising the country's banks, making [[Kiwibank]] the New Zealand government's official trading bank.<ref name="Stuff Maori seats 2017" /><ref>{{cite news|title=NZ First leader Winston Peters confirms Maori seat referendum for all voters|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11892732|accessdate=9 October 2017|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=19 July 2017}}</ref>

National Party leader and caretaker Prime Minister [[Bill English]] signalled an interest in forming a coalition with New Zealand First, while Labour leader [[Jacinda Ardern]] considered a three-way coalition with New Zealand First and the Greens. Peters stated that he would not make his final decision until the special votes results were released on 7 October 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Zealand election stalemate leaves maverick populist Winston Peters as kingmakeR|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/2112561/new-zealand-election-stalemate-leaves-maverick-populist|accessdate=29 September 2017|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=23 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|last2=Walters|first2=Laura|title=Recommended by Winston Peters launches tirade on media, stays mum on coalition talks|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/97306475/winston-peters-fronts-on-coalition-negotiations|accessdate=28 September 2017|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=28 September 2017}}</ref> During negotiations with Ardern, Peters indicated that he would be willing to consider dropping his call for a referendum on abolishing the Māori seats in return for forming a coalition with Labour; a bone of contention in New Zealand race relations.<ref name="Maori seats u-turn" />

In 2019, New Zealand First's Internal Affairs minister, Tracey Martin participated in negotiations with the Labour Party to pass the [[Abortion Legislation Act 2020|Abortion Legislation Bill]] to reform the country's [[Abortion in New Zealand|abortion]] laws. While Martin had ruled out supporting a referendum, she was overruled by the party leader Peters who demanded a binding referendum on the proposed legislation.

The amount of donations deposited into the foundation and used by the party was at odds with its official annual returns.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cooke |first1=Henry |title=Serious Fraud Office will investigate New Zealand First Foundation |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/119604574/serious-fraud-office-will-investigate-new-zealand-first-foundation |accessdate=6 March 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=18 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730010930/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/119604574/serious-fraud-office-will-investigate-new-zealand-first-foundation|archive-date=30 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Radio NZ 18 Feb 2020">{{cite news |last1=Patterson |first1=Jane |title=New Zealand First Foundation: Serious Fraud Office confirms investigation |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/409780/new-zealand-first-foundation-serious-fraud-office-confirms-investigation |accessdate=6 March 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=18 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726152835/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/409780/new-zealand-first-foundation-serious-fraud-office-confirms-investigation|archive-date=26 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Peters has denied any wrongdoing, while fellow MP Shane Jones, the [[Minister for Infrastructure (New Zealand)|Minister for Infrastructure]], has denounced allegations that the party was offering policy for cash as "conspiracy theories."<ref name="Radio NZ 18 Feb 2020" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/02/attempts-to-destroy-new-zealand-first-and-drive-winston-peters-out-of-politics-will-fail-shane-jones-claims.html|title=Attempts to 'destroy New Zealand First and drive Winston Peters out of politics' will fail, Shane Jones claims|work=[[Newshub]]|access-date=1 March 2020|language=en|date=29 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200510083211/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/02/attempts-to-destroy-new-zealand-first-and-drive-winston-peters-out-of-politics-will-fail-shane-jones-claims.html|archive-date=10 May 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>
