The [[2018 wildfire season]] was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire season in [[List of California wildfires|California history]]. The 2018 California wildfire season was also the second-largest on record, behind only the [[2020 California wildfires|2020 California wildfire season]].

In mid-July to August 2018, a series of large wildfires erupted across California, mostly in the northern part of the state, including the destructive [[Carr Fire]] and the Mendocino Complex Fire.

In November 2018, strong winds aggravated conditions in another round of large, destructive fires that occurred across the state. This new batch of wildfires included the [[Woolsey Fire]] and the Camp Fire. The Camp Fire destroyed the town of [[Paradise, California|Paradise]] and killed at least 85 people, with 1 still unaccounted for as of August 2, 2019.<ref name="Associated Press">{{Cite web |title=List of Missing in Camp Fire Down to 1 |url=https://fox40.com/2019/08/02/one-still-missing-in-camp-fire/ |publisher=FOX40 |agency=Associated Press |date=August 2, 2019|access-date=September 4, 2019}}</ref> The Camp Fire destroyed more than 18,000 structures, becoming both California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire on record.

==Causes==
Many different factors led to the 2018 California wildfire season becoming so destructive. A combination of an increased amount of natural fuel and compounding atmospheric conditions linked to [[global warming]] led to a series of destructive fires. Recent research on wildfires in California, published in August 2018, predicted an increase in the number of wildfires as a consequence of [[climate change]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.climateassessment.ca.gov/techreports/docs/20180827-Energy_CCCA4-CEC-2018-012.pdf |title=Assessing Extreme Weather‐Related Vulnerability and Identifying Resilience Options for California's Interdependent Transportation Fuel Sector |publisher=University of California, Berkeley Center for Catastrophic Risk Management |date=August 2018 |access-date=November 11, 2018}}</ref> However, from a historical perspective, it has been estimated that prior to 1850, about 4.5 million acres (17,000 km²) burned yearly, in fires that lasted for months.<ref name="SJMN_1"> {{cite news | url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/23/california-fires-state-feds-agree-to-thin-millions-of-acres-of-forests/ | title=California fires: State, feds agree to thin millions of acres of forests - New plan would last 20 years, reshaping California’s landscape | last=Rogers | first=Paul | newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]] | date=2020-08-23 | access-date=2020-09-11 | quote=Before the Gold Rush in 1849, large parts of California burned every few decades. Lightning fires burned for months, and native tribes burned the land, clearing out dead vegetation. ... Stephens, the UC fire scientist, estimates that before the Gold Rush, roughly 4.5 million acres a year in California burned. By the 1950s and 1960s, that was down to about 250,000 acres a year. }}</ref>

===Increase in fuel===
A direct contributor to the 2018 California wildfires was an increase in dead tree fuel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ferguson Fire: Tree mortality epidemic adding to fire crews' headaches |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Ferguson-Fire-Tree-mortality-epidemic-adding-to-13109023.php|website=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 26, 2018|access-date=August 7, 2018}}</ref> By December 2017, there was a record 129 million dead trees in California.<ref>{{cite web|title=Record 129 Million Dead Trees in California|url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd566303.pdf|publisher=[[United States Forest Service]]|date=July 1, 2018|access-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref>

===Atmospheric conditions===
[[Stanford University|Stanford]] [[Earth System Science]] Professor [[Noah Diffenbaugh]] stated that atmospheric conditions for [[California wildfires]] are expected to worsen in the future because of the effects of [[climate change in California]] and that "what we're seeing over the last few years in terms of the wildfire season in California [is] very consistent with the historical trends in terms of increasing temperatures, increasing dryness, and increasing wildfire risk." Other experts agreed, saying that global warming is to blame for these extreme weather conditions. Global warming led to higher temperatures and less rain, creating a drier landscape that gave fires more fuel to burn longer and stronger.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/carr-fire-latest-california-wildfire-worse-update-global-warming-a8471956.html|title=California wildfires will get worse in the future because of climate change, experts say|work=The Independent|access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref>

===Residential construction in the wildland-urban interface===
A [[wildland–urban interface]] (or WUI) refers to the zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. Communities that are within 0.5 miles (0.80&nbsp;km) of the zone may also be included. These lands and communities adjacent to and surrounded by wildlands are at risk of wildfires.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/03/06/1718850115|title=Rapid growth of the US wildland-urban interface raises wildfire risk|journal=PNAS|date=March 27, 2018|access-date=August 7, 2018|doi=10.1073/pnas.1718850115|volume=115|pages=3314–3319 | last1 = Radeloff | first1 = Volker C. | last2 = Helmers | first2 = David P. | last3 = Kramer | first3 = H.

In some areas, the amount of new residences in those areas is 80%.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/openspace/fote/reports/GTR-299.pdf | title=Wildfire, Wildlands, and People: Understanding and Preparing for Wildfire in the Wildland-Urban Interface|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service|date=January 2013|access-date=August 7, 2018}}</ref> In the past, when these areas burned, no residences were lost, but now residences are present, which end up being destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earther.gizmodo.com/we-re-building-millions-of-homes-in-the-line-of-wildfir-1823736981|title=We're Building Millions of Homes in the Line of Wildfires|first=Ari|last=Phillips|website=Gizmodo|access-date=November 9, 2018}}</ref>

==Air quality==
[[File:AirqualityCA2018August.jpg|thumb|right|Air quality of California on August 7, 2018]]
Northern California and the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] saw drastic increases in [[Air Pollutants|air pollutants]] during the height of the July and August fires, while Southern California also experienced an increase in air pollution in August.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Air Quality |url=https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_state|website=Air Now|date=August 7, 2018|access-date=August 7, 2018}}</ref> Air quality in Northern and Central California remained poor until mid-September 2018, when fire activity was drastically diminished. However, during the November [[Camp Fire (2018)|Camp Fire]], air quality diminished again, with the majority of the Bay Area being subjected to [[air quality index]]es (AQIs) of 200 and above, in the "unhealthy" region.

==Verizon Wireless data throttling==
In August 2018, the Santa Clara County Fire Department raised claims against [[Verizon Wireless]] that their "unlimited" data service had been [[Bandwidth throttling|throttled]] while the fire department was attempting to contain the [[Mendocino Complex Fire]]. The Verizon contract stated that the department's plan would be throttled down to 200 kbit/s or 600 kbit/s once the department had used 25 GB in a single month. However, the contract stated that the usage related throttling would not apply in certain emergency situations, such as wildfire containment operations. The plan remained throttled, despite the department's notification to Verizon regarding the situation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/|title=Verizon throttled fire department's "unlimited" data during Calif. wildfire|last=Brodkin|first=Jon|date=August 21, 2018|work=Ars Technica|access-date=August 24, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/fire-dept-rejects-verizons-customer-support-mistake-excuse-for-throttling/|title=Fire dept. rejects Verizon's 'customer support mistake' excuse for throttling|last=Brodkin|first=Jon|date=August 22, 2018|work=Ars Technica|access-date=August 24, 2018}}</ref>
