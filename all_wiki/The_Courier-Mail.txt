'''''The Courier-Mail''''' is a daily newspaper published in [[Brisbane]], Australia. Owned by [[News Corp Australia]], it is published daily from Monday to Saturday in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format. Its editorial offices are located at [[Bowen Hills, Queensland|Bowen Hills]], in Brisbane's inner northern suburbs, and it is printed at [[Murarrie, Queensland|Murarrie]], in Brisbane's eastern suburbs. It is available for purchase throughout [[Queensland]], most regions of Northern [[New South Wales]] and parts of the [[Northern Territory]].

==History==
The history of ''The Courier-Mail'' is through four [[Nameplate (publishing)|mastheads]]. The ''[[Moreton Bay Courier]]'' later became ''[[The Courier (Brisbane)|The Courier]]'', then the ''[[Brisbane Courier]]'' and since 1933 ''The Courier-Mail''.

The ''Moreton Bay Courier'' was established as a weekly paper in June 1846. Issue frequency increased steadily to bi-weekly in January 1858, tri-weekly in December 1859, then daily under the editorship of [[Theophilus Parsons Pugh]] from 14 May 1861. The recognised founder and first editor was [[Arthur Sidney Lyon]] (1817–1861) who was assisted by its printer, [[James Swan (mayor of Brisbane)|James Swan]] (1811–1891), the later [[mayor of Brisbane]] and member of [[Queensland Legislative Council]]. Lyon, also referred to as the "father of the Press" in the colony of Queensland, had previously served as a writer and journalist in Melbourne, and later moved on to found and edit journals such as ''Moreton Bay Free Press'', ''[[North Australian]]'' and ''[[Darling Downs Gazette]]''.<ref>Brisbane Courier 26 October 1861, p2c (obituary for Lyon); Brisbane Courier 22 August 1887, p.6 & 22 June 1926 'The Story of the Courier'</ref> Lyon was encouraged to emigrate by Rev. Dr. [[John Dunmore Lang]] and arrived in [[Brisbane]] from Sydney in early 1846 to establish a newspaper. He persuaded James Swan, a printer of Lang's Sydney newspaper ''[[The Colonialist]]'' to join him. Lyon and Swan established themselves on the corner of [[Queen Street, Brisbane|Queen Street]] and [[Albert Street, Brisbane]], in a garret of a building later known as the North Star Hotel. The first issue of the ''Moreton Bay Courier'', consisting of 4 pages, appeared weekly on Saturday 20 June 1846, with Lyon as [[editor in chief|editor]] and Swan as publisher.

After some 18 months, Lyon and Swan disagreed on many aspects of editorial policy, including transportation of convicts and [[squatting]]. Lyon took over sole control in late 1847, but had money problems, and gave sole control to Swan. Swan sold out to [[Thomas Blacket Stephens]] in about November 1859.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3526787 |title=DEATH OF THE HON.

The Journal was, from November 1873 to December 1880, managed by one of the new part owners, the Tasmanian-born former public servant [[Gresley Lukin]] (1840–1916). Although called 'managing editor', actual writing and editing was by [[William Augustine O'Carroll]] (1831–1885). Most prominent of the various editors and sub-editors of the Queenslander 'literary staff' were [[William Henry Traill]] (1842–1902), later NSW politician and editor of the famed Sydney journal '[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]', and [[Carl Feilberg|Carl Adolph Feilberg]] (1844–1887), who was Danish born but from the age of six educated in England and later in France. Carl Feilberg followed William Henry Trail in the role of political commentator and the de facto editor of the ''Queenslander'' to January 1881. He succeeded William O'Carroll as Courier editor-in-chief from September 1883 to his death in October 1887. Lukin's roles as part owner-editor changed on 21 December 1880. [[Charles Hardie Buzacott]] (1835–1918), former 'Postmaster General' in the first McIlwraith government, had been a staff journalist. [[John James Knight]] (1863–1927) was editor-in-chief of the ''Brisbane Courier'' 1906–16, later managing director, then chairman of all the company's publications.<ref>H. J. Summers, 'Knight, John James (1863–1927)', ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 9, [[Melbourne University Press|MUP]], 1983, pp 622–623</ref>

The first edition of ''The Courier-Mail'' was published on 28 August 1933, after [[Keith Murdoch]]'s [[The Herald and Weekly Times|Herald and Weekly Times]] acquired and merged the ''Brisbane Courier'' and the ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|Daily Mail]]'' (first published on 3 October 1903). In 1987, [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corp Australia|News Limited]] acquired newspaper control, and outstanding shares of Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.couriermail.com.au/help/about|title=About Us {{!}} The Courier Mail|language=en|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref>

==Political position==
''The Courier-Mail'' is a right leaning newspaper with four editorial endorsements for the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] to one for [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] in the period 1996–2007.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Partisan is the Press?

==Circulation and readership==
''The Courier-Mail'' has the fourth-highest circulation of any daily newspaper in Australia. Its average Monday-Friday net paid print sales were 172,801 between January and March 2013, having fallen 8.0 per cent compared to the previous year. Its average Saturday net paid print sales were 228,650 between January and March 2013, down 10.5 per cent compared to the previous year.<ref name="News2013">{{cite web |url=http://resources.news.com.au/files/2013/05/09/1226638/899726-130510-circulation.pdf |title=CIRCULATION AND READERSHIP |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>

Although often claimed to be Brisbane's only daily newspaper since the demise of [[Queensland Newspapers]]' own afternoon newspaper ''[[Telegraph (Brisbane)|The Telegraph]]'' in 1988, it arguably has had two competitors since 2007. [[News Corp (company)|News Corp]] itself published ''[[mX (newspaper)|mX]]'', a free afternoon newspaper, since 2007, but ''mX'' had a relatively low news content, and was discontinued in mid 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|title = News Corp shuts down mX newspaper|url = http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/news-corp-shuts-down-mx-newspaper-20150528-ghblr3.html|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=23 October 2015}}</ref> [[Fairfax Media]] has published the online ''[[Brisbane Times]]'' since 2007.

According to third-party [[web analytics]] providers [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] and [[SimilarWeb]], Courier-Mail's website is the 141st and 273rd most visited in Australia respectively, as of August 2015.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/couriermail.com.au  | title=couriermail.com.au Site Overview | publisher=Alexa | accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref><ref name="similar">{{cite web | url=http://www.similarweb.com/website/couriermail.com.au | title=Couriermail.com.au Analytics | publisher=SimilarWeb | accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref> At the same time, SimilarWeb rated the site as the 25th most visited news website in Australia, attracting almost 2.6 million visitors per month.<ref name="similar" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.similarweb.com/country_category/australia/news_and_media | title=Top 50 sites in Australia for News And Media | publisher=SimilarWeb | accessdate=2 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825042518/http://www.similarweb.com/country_category/australia/news_and_media | archivedate=25 August 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Its National Political Correspondent is Steven Scott. For thirty years, the paper's senior [[rugby league]] football journalist was former Australian vice-captain [[Jack Reardon]].  Sports Editor at The Courier Mail, Tom Linneth became the youngest editor in Australia in 1960 at the age of 29.  He worked at the Courier Mail between about 1948 to 1974 and again worked there as the sports editor between about 1982 until he retired in 1996.

==Change to tabloid==
[[Image:Courier-Mail front page 12-12-2005.jpg|thumb|right|Front page of ''The Courier-Mail'', 12 December 2005, prior to its conversion to a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format. The headline refers to the [[2005 Cronulla riots]].]]
From its inception until March 2006 ''The Courier-Mail'' was a broadsheet newspaper. On 14 December 2005 it was announced that the paper would change to a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] sometime in early 2006, however the term "tabloid" was not used in favour of the term "compact".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andrewbartlett.com/blog/?p=176 |title=Blog of Andrew Bartlett |publisher=Andrewbartlett.com |date=23 March 2006 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> This linguistic choice was probably related to widespread public view that many tabloids, including those published by [[News Corp Australia|News Limited]], were low quality publications (see [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] for discussion of this size and quality issue). Much emphasis was made that it was merely the paper size that was changing and not the journalistic quality. The last broadsheet edition was published on Saturday 11 March 2006, and the first tabloid edition was published on Monday 13 March 2006. On the same day, the paper's website was revamped and expanded.

The change to a tabloid format brought ''The Courier-Mail'' in line with all other [[News Corp Australia|News Limited]] Australian metropolitan daily newspapers. This followed the change to a tabloid format by ''[[The Advertiser (Australia)|The Advertiser]]'' of [[Adelaide]]—another News Corporation newspaper—some years earlier. Despite the claims that there would be no loss of journalistic quality, ''The Courier-Mail'' in its "compact" format is not well regarded for its journalism, e.g. the 'Crikey' website described it as "one of the contestants in a close run field for worst paper in Australia".<ref>{{cite web|author=Margaret Simons |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2007/06/26/crikey-bias-o-meter-the-newspapers/ |title=Crikey Bias-o-meter: The Newspapers |publisher=Crikey.com.au |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> In August 2011, police and the parents of a murder victim criticized the paper for falsely accusing their son of a child sex crime.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marissa Calligeros |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/child-sex-slur-disgusting-murder-victims-mum-20110802-1i9n4.html |title=Child sex slur disgusting murder victims mum |publisher=Brisbanetimes.com.au |date=3 August 2011 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>

On 24 March 2014 [[Queensland Newspapers]], the News Corp Australia subsidiary responsible for publishing the ''Courier-Mail'', was found guilty by a District Court of breaching restrictions on publishing Family Court proceedings on four occasions and fined a total of $120,000. The breaches occurred in 2012 when the ''Courier-Mail'' published on its front page the names and photos of a mother and her children involved in a Family Court dispute. District Court Justice Terence Martin said: "It seems to me that the newspaper seized upon what it regarded as a sensational story, which would be attractive to readers, and put the story ahead of its legal obligations".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Courier-Mail fined for identifying family in custody battle|website=Brisbane Times|date=24 March 2014|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/couriermail-fined-for-identifying-family-in-custody-battle-20140324-35cwg.html|accessdate=24 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701225304/https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/couriermail-fined-for-identifying-family-in-custody-battle-20140324-35cwg.html|archivedate=1 July 2017}}</ref>

==Criticism==
''The Courier-Mail'' has been viewed as controversial on several occasions. One particular instance, on 7 October 2014, the paper published a transphobic headline related to the gruesome murder of Mayang Prasetyo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/10/08/comment-how-media-reports-affect-trans-people-and-what-should-be-done|title=Comment: How media reports affect trans people, and what should be done|author= Eloise Brook|date=8 October 2014|publisher=Special Broadcasting Service}}</ref> It also raised controversy for depicting Indonesian president [[Joko Widodo]] with a doctored photo of bloody hands to protest against the country's decision to execute two Australian convicted drug smugglers known as part of the [[Bali Nine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-2901157/media-australia-gambarkan-tangan-jokowi-bersimbah-darah|title=Media Australia Gambarkan Tangan Jokowi Bersimbah Darah|language= id|date=29 April 2015|website=Detik.com}}</ref>
