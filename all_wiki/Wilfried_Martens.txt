'''Wilfried Achiel Emma Martens''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈʋɪlfrit ˈmɑrtə(n)s|lang|Nl-be wilfried martens.ogg}}; 19 April 1936 – 9 October 2013) was a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[Belgian]] politician. He was born in [[Evergem|Sleidinge]] ([[East Flanders]]). During his political career, Martens served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Belgium|Prime Minister of Belgium]] from 3 April 1979 to 6 April 1981 and 17 December 1981 to 7 March 1992.

== Political career ==
Martens was a Chair of the Belgian Christian People's Party (now renamed [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic and Flemish]] party, CD&V) from 1972 to 1979, sitting as a Deputy in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives (federal parliament) from 1974 to 1991, and serving as a Senator from 1991 to 1994.

Wilfried Martens served as Prime Minister in nine coalition governments ([[Martens I Government|Martens I]]-IX) from 3 April 1979 to 6 April 1981 and 17 December 1981 to 7 March 1992. His period in office was dominated by the economic crisis of the 1980s and the state reforms of 1980 and 1988 which set Belgium on a path to [[federalism]].

He co-founded the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) in 1976 and was EPP President from 1992 until his death.

From 1993 he was President of the European Union of Christian Democrats (EUCD), until its merger with the EPP in 1996. Martens also negotiated with Finnish conservative politician [[Sauli Niinistö]] the merger of the [[European Democrat Union]] (EDU) into the EPP (formally concluded in 2002). The successful fusion of all centre-right European organisations into the EPP – currently the largest transnational [[European political party]] with 75 member-parties from 40 countries – is widely recognised as an important achievement of his European political legacy.

From 1994 to 1998, he was a Member of the European Parliament, chairing the EPP Group.

From October 2000 to November 2001 he was also the President of the [[Christian Democrat International]] (CDI).

He re-appeared on the Belgian political stage on 22 December 2008 to help in the [[2007–2011 Belgian political crisis]].

Martens held a doctorate in law, a degree in notarial studies, as well as a baccalaureate in [[Thomism|Thomistic philosophy]] from the [[Université catholique de Louvain|Catholic University of Louvain]]. He also studied international political science at [[Harvard University]]. He has practised law at the [[Ghent]] [[Court of appeal (Belgium)|court of appeal]].

Among numerous national and international distinctions, he was honoured in 1998 with the [[Charles V European Award]] for his contribution to European Union.

== Private life ==
Martens had five children: two from his first marriage with Lieve Verschroeven (Kris and Anne) and three with Ilse Schouteden (Sarah, Sophie and Simon). After the birth of their twins in 1997 they married on 13 November 1998. Ilse Schouteden has a son from her previous marriage. In 2007 he divorced his second wife. On 27 September 2008 he married [[Miet Smet]], a former Belgian minister. It was his third marriage and her first. After the death of his first wife, Martens was able to celebrate the marriage to Miet Smet in the Catholic Church, on 27 April 2013.
