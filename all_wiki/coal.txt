'''Coal''' is a [[combustible]] black or brownish-black [[sedimentary rock]], formed as [[stratum|rock strata]] called [[coal seams]].

==Etymology==
The word originally took the form ''col'' in [[Old English]], from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''kula''(''n''), which in turn is hypothesized to come from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *''g''(''e'')''u-lo-'' "live coal".<ref name=etym>{{OEtymD|coal}}</ref> [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] cognates include the [[Old Frisian]] ''kole'', [[Middle Dutch]] ''cole'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''kool'', [[Old High German]] ''chol'', [[German language|German]] ''Kohle'' and [[Old Norse]] ''kol'', and the [[Irish language|Irish]] word ''gual'' is also a cognate via the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] root.<ref name=etym/>

[[File:Struktura chemiczna węgla kamiennego.svg| thumb|Example chemical structure of coal]]

The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called [[wikt:coalification|coalification]]. At various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|title=How Coal Is Formed|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113211/http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in low-lying wetland areas. In these wetlands, the process of coalification began when dead plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water, and was converted into [[peat]]. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually deeply buried by sediments. Then, over millions of years, the heat and pressure of deep burial caused the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide and increased in the proportion of carbon.<ref name="BGS"/> The grade of coal produced depended on the maximum pressure and temperature reached, with [[lignite]] (also called "brown coal") produced under relatively mild conditions, and [[sub-bituminous coal]], [[bituminous coal]], or [[anthracite]] (also called "hard coal" or "black coal") produced in turn with increasing temperature and pressure.<ref name="EIA Coal Explained" /><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160516231216/https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| archivedate = 16 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Of the factors involved in coalification, temperature is much more important than either pressure or time of burial.<ref>{{cite web |title=Heat, time, pressure, and coalification |url=http://www.uky.edu/KGS/coal/coal-heat-time-pressure.php |website=Kentucky Geological Survey: Earth Resources -- Our Common Wealth |publisher=University of Kentucky |access-date=28 November 2020}}</ref> Subbituminous coal can form at temperatures as low as {{ convert|35 to 80|C||sp=us}} while anthracite requires a temperature of at least {{convert|180 to 245|C||sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Burial temperatures from coal |url=http://www.uky.edu/KGS/coal/coal-burial-temperature.php |website=Kentucky Geological Survey: Earth Resources -- Our Common Wealth |publisher=University of Kentucky |access-date=28 November 2020}}</ref>

Although coal is known from most geologic periods, 90% of all coal beds were deposited in the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] [[Period (geology)|periods]], which represent just 2% of the Earth's geologic history.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McGhee |first1=George R. |title=Carboniferous giants and mass extinction : the late Paleozoic Ice Age world |date=2018 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780231180979 |pages=98}}</ref> Paradoxically, this was during the [[Late Paleozoic icehouse]], a time of global [[Ice age|glaciation]]. However, the drop in global sea level accompanying the glaciation exposed [[continental shelf]]s that had previously been submerged, and to these were added wide [[river delta]]s produced by increased [[erosion]] due to the drop in [[base level]]. These widespread areas of wetlands provided ideal conditions for coal formation.{{sfn|McGhee|2018|pp=88-92}} The rapid formation of coal ended with the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event#Coal Gap|coal gap]] in the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], where coal is rare.<ref name="Retallack1996">{{cite journal| last1=Retallack |first1=G.

Favorable geography alone does not explain the extensive Carboniferous coal beds.{{sfn|McGhee|2018|p=99}} Other factors contributing to rapid coal deposition were high [[oxygen]] levels, above 30%, that promoted intense [[wildfire]]s and formation of [[charcoal]] that was all but indigestible by decomposing organisms; high [[carbon dioxide]] levels that promoted plant growth; and the nature of Carboniferous forests, which included [[lycophyte]] trees whose [[determinate growth]] meant that carbon was not tied up in [[heartwood]] of living trees for long periods.{{sfn|McGhee|2018|pp=98-102}} 

One theory suggested that about 360 million years ago, some plants evolved the ability to produce [[lignin]], a complex polymer that made their [[cellulose]] stems much harder and more woody. The ability to produce lignin led to the evolution of the first [[trees]]. But bacteria and fungi did not immediately evolve the ability to decompose lignin, so the wood did not fully decay but became buried under sediment, eventually turning into coal. About 300 million years ago, mushrooms and other fungi developed this ability, ending the main coal-formation period of earth's history.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mushroom-evolution-breaks-down-lignin-slows-coal-formation |title = White Rot Fungi Slowed Coal Formation}}</ref> However, a 2016 study largely refuted this idea, finding extensive evidence of lignin degradation during the Carboniferous, and that shifts in lignin abundance had no impact on coal formation. They suggested that climatic and tectonic factors were a more plausible explanation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nelsen|first=Matthew P.|last2=DiMichele|first2=William A.|last3=Peters|first3=Shanan E.|last4=Boyce|first4=C.

Sometimes coal seams (also known as coal beds) are interbedded with other sediments in a [[cyclothem]]. Cyclothems are thought have their origin in [[glacial cycle]]s that produced fluctuations in [[sea level]], which alternately exposed and then flooded large areas of continental shelf.<ref>Stanley, Steven M.

====Chemistry of coalification====
Modern peat is mostly lignin. The cellulose and hemicellulose component ranges from 5% to 40%.

Carbonization proceeds primarily by [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]], [[decarboxylation]], and demethanation. Dehydration removes water molecules from the maturing coal via reactions such as<ref name="hatcher-etal-1992">{{cite journal |last1=Hatcher |first1=Patrick G. |last2=Faulon |first2=Jean Loup |last3=Wenzel |first3=Kurt A. |last4=Cody |first4=George D. |title=A structural model for lignin-derived vitrinite from high-volatile bituminous coal (coalified wood) |journal=Energy & Fuels |date=November 1992 |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=813–820 |doi=10.1021/ef00036a018}}</ref>

:2 R–OH → R–O–R + H<sub>2</sub>O

Decarboxylation removes carbon dioxide from the maturing coal and proceeds by reaction such as<ref name="hatcher-etal-1992"/>

:RCOOH  →  RH  +  CO<sub>2</sub>

while demethanation proceeds by reaction such as

:2 R-CH<sub>3</sub> → R-CH<sub>2</sub>-R + CH<sub>4</sub>

In each of these formulas, R represents the remainder of a cellulose or lignin molecule to which the reacting groups are attached.

Dehydration and decarboxylation take place early in coalification, while demethanation begins only after the coal has already reached bituminous rank.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coal Types, Formation and Methods of Mining |url=http://epcamr.org/home/content/reference-materials/coal-types-formation-and-methods-of-mining/ |publisher=Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation |access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref> The effect of decarboxylation is to reduce the percentage of oxygen, while demethanation reduces the percentage of hydrogen. Dehydration does both.

As carbonization proceeds, [[aliphatic compound]]s (carbon compounds characterized by chains of carbon atoms) are replaced by [[aromatic compound]]s (carbon compounds characterized by rings of carbon atoms) and aromatic rings begin to fuse into [[polyaromatic]] compounds (linked rings of carbon atoms).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ibarra |first1=JoséV. |last2=Muñoz |first2=Edgar |last3=Moliner |first3=Rafael |title=FTIR study of the evolution of coal structure during the coalification process |journal=Organic Geochemistry |date=June 1996 |volume=24 |issue=6–7 |pages=725–735 |doi=10.1016/0146-6380(96)00063-0}}</ref> The structure increasingly resembles [[graphene]], the structural element of graphite.

As geological processes apply [[pressure]] to dead [[biotic material]] over time, under suitable conditions, its [[metamorphic grade]] or rank increases successively into:
* [[Peat]], a precursor of coal
* [[Lignite]], or brown coal, the lowest rank of coal, most harmful to health,<ref>{{cite web |title=Lignite coal - health effects and recommendations from the health sector |url=https://www.env-health.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/HEAL-Lignite-Briefing-en_web.pdf |publisher=Health and Environment Alliance (HEAL)}}</ref> used almost exclusively as fuel for electric power generation
** [[jet (lignite)|Jet]], a compact form of lignite, sometimes polished; used as an ornamental stone since the [[Upper Palaeolithic]]
* [[Sub-bituminous coal]], whose properties range between those of lignite and those of bituminous coal, is used primarily as fuel for steam-electric power generation.
* [[Bituminous coal]], a dense sedimentary rock, usually black, but sometimes dark brown, often with well-defined bands of bright and dull material. It is used primarily as fuel in steam-electric power generation and to make [[coke (fuel)|coke]]. Known as steam coal in the UK, and historically used to raise steam in steam locomotives and ships 
* [[Anthracite]], the highest rank of coal, is a harder, glossy black coal used primarily for residential and commercial [[space heating]].
* [[Graphite]] is difficult to ignite and not commonly used as fuel; it is most used in pencils, or powdered for [[lubrication]].

[[Cannel coal]] (sometimes called "candle coal") is a variety of fine-grained, high-rank coal with significant hydrogen content, which consists primarily of [[liptinite]].

There are several international standards for coal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Standards catalogue 73.040 – Coals |url=https://www.iso.org/ics/73.040/x/ |publisher=[[ISO]]}}</ref> The classification of coal is generally based on the content of [[coal volatiles|volatiles]]. However the most important distinction is between thermal coal (also known as steam coal), which is burnt to generate electricity via steam; and [[metallurgical coal]] (also known as coking coal), which is burnt at high temperature to make [[steel]].

[[Hilt's law]] is a geological observation that (within a small area) the deeper the coal is found, the higher its rank (or grade). It applies if the thermal gradient is entirely vertical; however, [[metamorphism]] may cause lateral changes of rank, irrespective of depth. For example, some of the coal seams of the [[Madrid, New Mexico]] coal field were partially converted to anthracite by [[contact metamorphism]] from an igneous [[Sill (geology)|sill]] while the remainder of the seams remained as bituminous coal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Darton |first1=Horatio Nelson |title=Guidebook of the Western United States: Part C - The Santa Fe Route, with a side trip to Grand Canyon of the Colorado |journal=U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin |date=1916 |volume=613 |page=81 |doi=10.3133/b613|hdl=2027/hvd.32044055492656 }}</ref>

==Emission intensity==
[[Emission intensity]] is the [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|greenhouse gas emitted over the life of a generator]] per unit of electricity generated. The emission intensity of [[coal power station]]s is high, as they emit around 1000g of CO2eq for each kWh generated, while natural gas is medium-emission intensity at around 500g CO2eq per kWh. The emission intensity of coal varies with type and generator technology and exceeds 1200g per kWh in some countries.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Real-Time Carbon Accounting Method for the European Electricity Markets |journal=Energy Strategy Reviews|volume=26|pages=100367|arxiv=1812.06679 |last1=Tranberg |first1=Bo |last2=Corradi|first2=Olivier|last3=Lajoie|first3=Bruno|last4=Gibon|first4=Thomas|last5=Staffell|first5=Iain|author6=Gorm Bruun Andresen|doi=10.1016/j.esr.2019.100367|year=2019|s2cid=125361063}}</ref>

===Composition===
The composition of coal is reported either as a [[proximate analysis]] (moisture, volatile matter, fixed carbon, and ash) or an [[ultimate analysis]] (ash, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur). The "volatile matter" does not exist by itself (except for some adsorbed methane) but designates the volatile compounds that are produced and driven off by heating the coal. A typical bituminous coal may have an ultimate analysis on a dry, ash-free basis of 84.4% carbon, 5.4% hydrogen, 6.7% oxygen, 1.7% nitrogen, and 1.8% sulfur, on a weight basis.<ref name=Perry>{{cite book |editor1-last=Robert Perry |editor2-last=Cecil Chilton |chapter=Chapter 9: Heat Generation, Transport, and Storage|first=William|last=Reid|title=Chemical Engineers' Handbook |date=1973 |edition=5}}</ref>

===Coking coal and use of coke to smelt iron===
{{Main|Coke (fuel)}}
[[File:Coke Ovens Abercwmboi.jpg|right|thumb|Coke oven at a [[smokeless fuel]] plant in [[Wales]], United Kingdom]]

Coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from [[coking coal]] (a low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal, also known as ''metallurgical coal''), which is used in manufacturing [[steel]] and other iron products.<ref name="World Coal Steel">{{cite web|title=How is Steel Produced?|url=https://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-coal/how-steel-produced|publisher=[[World Coal Association]]|access-date=April 8, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412114829/https://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-coal/how-steel-produced|archivedate=12 April 2017|df=dmy-all|date=2015-04-28}}</ref> Coke is made from coking coal by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000&nbsp;°C, driving off the volatile constituents and fusing together the fixed carbon and residual ash. Metallurgical coke is used as a [[fuel]] and as a [[reducing agent]] in [[smelting]] [[iron ore]] in a [[blast furnace]].<ref>[http://www.steelonthenet.com/cost-bof.html Blast furnace steelmaking cost model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114013811/http://www.steelonthenet.com/cost-bof.html |date=14 January 2016 }}. Steelonthenet.com. Retrieved on 24 August 2012.</ref>  The carbon monoxide produced by its combustion reduces [[hematite]] (an [[iron oxide]]) to [[iron]].

Waste carbon dioxide is also produced {{nowrap|(<chem id="2Fe2O3 + 3C ">2Fe2O3 + 3C -> 4Fe + 3CO2 </chem>)}} together with [[pig iron]], which is too rich in dissolved carbon so must be treated further to make steel.

Coking coal should be low in ash, [[sulfur]], and [[phosphorus]], so that these do not migrate to the metal.<ref name="World Coal Steel"/>
The coke must be [[Coke strength after reaction|strong enough]] to resist the weight of overburden in the blast furnace, which is why coking coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route. Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 29.6 MJ/kg. Some cokemaking processes produce byproducts, including [[coal tar]], [[ammonia]], light oils, and [[coal gas]].

[[Petroleum coke]] (petcoke) is the solid residue obtained in [[oil refining]], which resembles coke but contains too many impurities to be useful in metallurgical applications.

====Use in foundry components {{anchor|Industrial processes|Sea coal}}====
Finely ground bituminous coal, known in this application as sea coal, is a constituent of [[foundry sand]]. While the molten metal is in the [[Molding (process)|mould]], the coal burns slowly, releasing [[Reducing agent|reducing gases]] at pressure, and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand. It is also contained in 'mould wash', a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=P. N.|title=Manufacturing technology: foundry, forming and welding|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|location=New Delhi|year=2007|edition=2|page=107|chapter=Moulding materials|isbn=978-0-07-463180-5}}</ref> Sea coal can be mixed with the clay lining (the "bod") used for the bottom of a [[cupola furnace]]. When heated, the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable, easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kirk|first=Edward|title=Cupola Furnace – A Practical Treatise on the Construction and Management of Foundry Cupolas|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/cupolafurnacepra00kirkiala|publisher=Baird|location=Philadelphia|year=1899|page=[https://archive.org/details/cupolafurnacepra00kirkiala/page/95 95]|chapter=Cupola management|oclc=2884198}}</ref>

====Alternatives to coke====
Scrap steel can be recycled in an [[electric arc furnace]]; and an alternative to making iron by smelting is [[direct reduced iron]], where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron. To lessen carbon dioxide emissions [[hydrogen]] can be used as the reducing agent<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-29/how-hydrogen-could-solve-steel-s-climate-test-and-hobble-coal|title=How Hydrogen Could Solve Steel's Climate Test and Hobble Coal|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref> and [[biomass]] or waste as the source of carbon.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coking Coal for steel production and alternatives |url=https://leard.frontlineaction.org/coking-coal-steel-production-alternatives/ |publisher=Front Line Action on Coal |access-date=1 December 2018}}</ref> Historically, charcoal has been used as an alternative to coke in a blast furnace, with the resultant iron being known as [[charcoal iron]].

===Gasification===
{{Main|Coal gasification|Underground coal gasification}}
Coal gasification, as part of an [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) coal-fired power station, is used to produce [[syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas to fire gas turbines to produce electricity. Syngas can also be converted into transportation fuels, such as [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], through the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]]; alternatively, syngas can be converted into [[methanol]], which can be blended into fuel directly or converted to gasoline via the methanol to gasoline process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/methanol-to-gasoline |title=Conversion of Methanol to Gasoline |publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory |access-date=16 July 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717225057/http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/methanol-to-gasoline |archivedate=17 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Gasification combined with Fischer-Tropsch technology was used by the [[Sasol]] chemical company of [[South Africa]] to make chemicals and motor vehicle fuels from coal.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sasol Is Said to Plan Sale of Its South Africa Coal Mining Unit|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-18/sasol-is-said-to-plan-sale-of-its-south-africa-coal-mining-unit|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bloomberg.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-31}}</ref>

During gasification, the coal is mixed with [[oxygen]] and [[steam]] while also being heated and pressurized. During the reaction, oxygen and water molecules [[Redox|oxidize]] the coal into carbon monoxide (CO), while also releasing [[hydrogen]] gas (H<sub>2</sub>). This used to be done in underground coal mines, and also to make [[town gas]] which was piped to customers to burn for illumination, heating, and cooking.

: 3C (''as Coal'') + O<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → H<sub>2</sub> + 3CO

If the refiner wants to produce gasoline, the syngas is routed into a Fischer-Tropsch reaction. This is known as indirect coal liquefaction. If hydrogen is the desired end-product, however, the syngas is fed into the [[water gas shift reaction]], where more hydrogen is liberated:

: CO + H<sub>2</sub>O → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>

===Liquefaction===
{{Main|Coal liquefaction}}

Coal can be converted directly into [[synthetic fuel]]s equivalent to gasoline or diesel by [[hydrogenation]] or [[carbonization]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/direct-liquefaction|title=Direct Liquefaction Processes|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory|access-date=16 July 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725082303/http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/direct-liquefaction|archivedate=25 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Coal liquefaction emits more carbon dioxide than liquid fuel production from [[crude oil]].

===Production of chemicals===
[[File:Coal to chemicals routes diagram.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Production of chemicals from coal]]

Chemicals have been produced from coal since the 1950s. Coal can be used as a feedstock in the production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products. The main route to these products was [[coal gasification]] to produce [[syngas]]. Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including [[olefins]], [[acetic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[urea]] and others. The versatility of [[syngas]] as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using coal to produce a wide range of commodities. In the 21st century, however, the use of [[Coalbed methane|coal bed methane]] is becoming more important.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Coal India begins process of developing Rs 2,474 crore CBM projects {{!}} Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide|url=https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/coal-india-begins-process-of-developing-rs-2474-crore-cbm-projects/|website=www.hellenicshippingnews.com|access-date=2020-05-31}}</ref>

Because the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]], the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tended to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that might have strained oil and gas production.

Refined coal is the product of a coal-upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite (brown) coals. It is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal's characteristics before it is burned. Thermal efficiency improvements are achievable by improved pre-drying (especially relevant with high-moisture fuel such as lignite or biomass).<ref>{{cite web | title = The Niederraussem Coal Innovation Centre | publisher = RWE | url = http://www.rwe.com/web/cms/mediablob/en/234504/data/2378/5/rwe-power-ag/innovations/coal-innovation-centre/Brochure-The-Niederaussem-Coal-Innovation-Centre.pdf | access-date = 21 July 2014 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130722025133/http://www.rwe.com/web/cms/mediablob/en/234504/data/2378/5/rwe-power-ag/innovations/coal-innovation-centre/Brochure-The-Niederaussem-Coal-Innovation-Centre.pdf | archivedate = 22 July 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned. Precombustion technology can sometimes be used as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers.

Coal burnt as a [[solid fuel]] in [[list of coal power stations|coal power stations]] to [[electricity generation|generate electricity]] is called thermal coal. Coal is also used to produce very high temperatures through combustion. Early deaths due to air pollution have been estimated at 200 per GW-year, however they may be higher around power plants where scrubbers are not used or lower if they are far from cities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://berkeleyearth.org/deaths-per-gigawatt-year/|title=Coal in China: Estimating Deaths per GW-year|date=2016-11-18|website=Berkeley Earth|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref> Efforts around the world to reduce the use of coal have led some regions to switch to natural gas and electricity from lower carbon sources.

When coal is used for [[electricity generation]], it is usually pulverized and then burned in a [[furnace]] with a [[boiler]].<ref name="World Coal">[http://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-of-coal/coal-electricity/ Total World Electricity Generation by Fuel (2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022093430/http://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-of-coal/coal-electricity/ |date=22 October 2015 }}.

A few [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) power plants have been built, which burn coal more efficiently. Instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steam-generating boiler, the [[coal gasification|coal is gasified]] to create [[syngas]], which is burned in a [[gas turbine]] to produce electricity (just like natural gas is burned in a turbine). Hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a [[heat recovery steam generator]] which powers a supplemental [[steam turbine]]. The overall plant efficiency when used to provide [[combined heat and power]] can reach as much as 94%.<ref>[http://ipaper.ipapercms.dk/DONGENERGY/Internet/UK/ThermalPower/AVVbrochure2012UK/ Avedøreværket] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129110317/http://ipaper.ipapercms.dk/DONGENERGY/Internet/UK/ThermalPower/AVVbrochure2012UK/ |date=29 January 2016 }}.

===Coal mining===
{{main|Coal mining}}
About 8000 Mt of coal are produced annually, about 90% of which is hard coal and 10% lignite. {{As of|2018}} just over half is from underground mines.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coal mining |url=https://www.worldcoal.org/coal/coal-mining |publisher=[[World Coal Association]] |access-date=5 December 2018|date=2015-04-28 }}</ref> More accidents occur during underground mining than surface mining. Not all countries publish [[mining accident]] statistics so worldwide figures are uncertain, but it is thought that most deaths occur in [[List of coal mining accidents in China|coal mining accidents in China]]: in 2017 there were 375 coal mining related deaths in China.<ref>{{cite news |title=China: seven miners killed after skip plummets down mine shaft |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/16/miners-killed-in-south-west-china-mining-accident |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 December 2018|last1=France-Presse |first1=Agence }}</ref> Most coal mined is thermal coal (also called steam coal as it is used to make steam to generate electricity) but metallurgical coal (also called "metcoal" or "coking coal" as it is used to make coke to make iron) accounts for 10% to 15% of global coal use.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The One Market That's Sure To Help Coal |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2018/08/12/the-one-market-thats-sure-to-help-coal/#570c071f6f6e |magazine=[[Forbes]] |date=12 August 2018}}</ref>

===Coal as a traded commodity===
[[Coal mining in China|China mines]] almost half the world's coal, followed by [[Coal mining in India|India]] with about a tenth.<ref name="BPReview2016"/> [[Coal in Australia|Australia]] accounts for about a third of world coal exports, followed by [[Energy in Indonesia#Coal|Indonesia]] and [[Coal in Russia|Russia]]; while the largest importers are [[Energy in Japan|Japan]] and India.

The price of metallurgical coal is volatile<ref>{{cite web |title=Coal 2017 |url=https://eneken.ieej.or.jp/data/7732.pdf |publisher=[[International Energy Agency|IEA]] |access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref> and much higher than the price of thermal coal because metallurgical coal must be lower in sulfur and requires more cleaning.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coal Prices and Outlook |url=https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.php?page=coal_prices |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration}}</ref> Coal futures contracts provide coal producers and the [[electric power industry]] an important tool for [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] and [[risk management]].

In some countries new onshore [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar power|solar]] generation already costs less than coal power from existing plants (see [[Cost of electricity by source]]).<ref>{{Cite news| title = New wind and solar generation costs fall below existing coal plants |work=Financial Times| access-date = 2018-11-08| url = https://www.ft.com/content/af6915c8-e2eb-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Lazard's Levelized Cost of Energy ('LCOE') analysis – Version 12.0 |url=https://www.lazard.com/media/450773/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-120-vfinal.pdf |access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref>

===Market trends===
Of the [[List of countries by coal production|countries which produce coal]] China mines by far the most, almost half the world's coal, followed by less than 10% by India. China is also by far the largest consumer. Therefore, market trends depend on [[Energy policy of China|Chinese energy policy]].<ref name=IEA2018>{{cite web |title=Coal 2018:Executive Summary |url=https://webstore.iea.org/download/summary/2415 |publisher=[[International Energy Agency]] |date=2018}}</ref> Although the effort to reduce pollution means that the global long-term trend is to burn less coal, the short and medium term trends may differ, in part due to Chinese financing of new coal-fired power plants in other countries.<ref name="Cornot-Gandolfe 2018">{{cite book |last1=Cornot-Gandolfe |first1=Sylvie |title=A Review of Coal Market Trends and Policies in 2017|date=May 2018 |publisher=Ifri |url=https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/cornot_gandolphe_coal_exit_2018.pdf}}</ref>

===Stranded assets===
Some coal-fired power stations could become [[stranded assets]], for example [[China Energy Investment]], the world's largest power company, risks losing half its capital.<ref name="CarbTrk2018" /> However state owned electricity utilities such as [[Eskom]] in South Africa, [[Perusahaan Listrik Negara]] in Indonesia, [[Sarawak Energy]] in Malaysia, [[Taipower]] in Taiwan, [[EGAT]] in Thailand, [[Vietnam Electricity]] and [[EÜAŞ]] in Turkey are building or planning new plants.<ref name="Urgewald 2018" /> {{As of|2019}} this may be helping to cause a [[carbon bubble]] which could cause financial instability if it bursts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/climate/stranded-fossil-fuel-assets-may-prompt-4-trillion-crisis|title="Stranded" fossil fuel assets may prompt $4 trillion crisis|website=Cosmos Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref>

==Politics==
Countries building or financing new coal-fired power stations, such as China, India, and Japan, face mounting international criticism for obstructing the aims of the [[Paris Agreement]].<ref name="Cornot-Gandolfe 2018" /> In 2019, the Pacific Island nations (in particular [[Vanuatu]] and [[Fiji]]) criticized Australia for failing to cut their emissions at a faster rate than they were, citing concerns about coastal inundation and erosion.<ref name=Guardian2018/>

===Switch to cleaner fuels and lower carbon electricity generation===
{{See also|Natural gas#Power generation}}

Coal-fired generation puts out about twice the amount of carbon dioxide—around a tonne for every megawatt hour generated—than electricity generated by burning natural gas at 500&nbsp;kg of [[greenhouse gas]] per megawatt hour.<ref>{{cite web |title=Electricity emissions around the world |url=http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/electricity-emissions-around-the-world |access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref> In addition to generating electricity, natural gas is also popular in some countries for heating and as an [[Natural gas vehicle|automotive fuel]].

The use of [[Energy in the United Kingdom|coal in the United Kingdom]] declined as a result of the development of [[North Sea oil]] and the subsequent [[dash for gas]] during the 1990s. In Canada some [[Thermal power station|coal power plants]], such as the [[Hearn Generating Station]], switched from coal to natural gas.
