The '''National Portrait Gallery''' is a historic [[art museum]] between 7th, 9th, F, and G Streets NW in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States. Founded in 1962 and opened to the public in 1968, it is part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Its collections focus on images of famous Americans. The museum is housed in the historic [[Old Patent Office Building]], as is the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].

==History==

===Founding of the museum===
The first portrait gallery in the United States was [[Charles Willson Peale]]'s "American Pantheon" (also known as "Peale's Collection of Portraits of American Patriots"), established in 1796. It closed after two years.  In 1859, the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in London opened, but few Americans took notice.<ref name="ThompsonWhoGets">Thompson, Bob. "Who Gets Into the National Portrait Gallery, and Why?" ''Washington Post.'' June 13, 1999.</ref> The idea of a federally owned national portrait gallery can be traced back to 1886, when Robert C. Winthrope, president of the Massachusetts Historical Society, visited the National Portrait Gallery in London. Upon his return to the United States, Winthrope began pressing for the establishment of a similar museum in America.<ref>Smith, p. 268.</ref>

In January 1919, the Smithsonian Institution entered into a cooperative endeavor with the [[American Federation of Arts]] and the American Mission to Negotiate Peace to create a National Art Committee.  The committee's goal was to commission portraits of famous leaders from the various nations involved in World War I. Among the committee's members were oil company executive [[Herbert L. Pratt]], Ethel Sperry Crocker (an art aficionado and wife of [[William Henry Crocker]], founder of [[Crocker National Bank]]), architect [[Abram Garfield]], [[Mary Williamson Averell]] (wife of railway executive [[E. H. Harriman]]), financier [[J. P. Morgan]], attorney [[Charles Phelps Taft]] (brother of President [[William Howard Taft]]), steel magnate [[Henry Clay Frick]], and paleontologist [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]].<ref name="Siris">{{cite web|url=http://siris-sihistory.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&menu=search&aspect=power&npp=50&ipp=20&spp=20&profile=sicall&ri=&index=.GW&term=&oper=AND&x=10&y=8&aspect=power&index=.SW&term=national+portrait+gallery&oper=AND&index=.YDW&term=&oper=AND&index=.AU&term=&limitbox_1=LO01+%3D+sch&ultype=&uloper=%3D&ullimit=&ultype=&uloper=%3D&ullimit=&sort=3100012|title=Chronology of the National Portrait Gallery|section=Chronology of Smithsonian History|website=Smithsonian Institution Research Information System|date=2012|access-date=February 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129095520/http://siris-sihistory.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&menu=search&aspect=power&npp=50&ipp=20&spp=20&profile=sicall&ri=&index=.GW&term=&oper=AND&x=10&y=8&aspect=power&index=.SW&term=national+portrait+gallery&oper=AND&index=.YDW&term=&oper=AND&index=.AU&term=&limitbox_1=LO01+%3D+sch&ultype=&uloper=%3D&ullimit=&ultype=&uloper=%3D&ullimit=&sort=3100012|archive-date=November 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The portraits commissioned went on display in the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in May 1921.  This formed the nucleus of what would become the National Portrait Gallery Collection.<ref>Oehser, p. 146.</ref>

[[File:AWMellon.jpg|thumb|left|Andrew W. Mellon, whose art collection was one of the foundations of the National Portrait Gallery collection.]]
In 1937, [[Andrew W. Mellon]] donated his large collection of classic and modernist art to the United States, which led to the foundation of the [[National Gallery of Art]]. The collection included a large number of portraits. Mellon asked that, should a portrait gallery be created, the portraits be transferred to it.  [[David E. Finley, Jr.]], an attorney and one of Mellon's closest friends, was named the first director of the National Gallery of Art, and he pushed hard over the next several years for the establishment of a portrait gallery.<ref name="ThompsonWhoGets" />

In 1957, a proposal was made by the federal government to demolish the Old Patent Office Building. After a public outcry and an agreement to save the historic structure, Congress authorized the Smithsonian Institution to use the structure as a museum in March 1958.<ref>Oehser, p. 200.</ref> Shortly thereafter, the Smithsonian Art Commission asked the Chancellor of the Smithsonian to appoint a committee to organize a national portrait museum and to plan for the establishment of this museum in the Old Patent Office Building. This committee was created in 1960.<ref name="Siris"/>

The National Portrait Gallery (NPG) was authorized and founded by Congress in 1962.<ref name="Schultz">Schultz, p. 272.</ref> The enabling legislation defined its purpose as displaying portraits of "men and women who have made significant contributions to the history, development, and culture of the people of the United States."<ref name="Schultz" /> The legislation specified, however, that the museum's collection be limited to painting, prints, drawings, and engravings.<ref name="Siris" /><ref name="NewFace" /> Despite the Smithsonian's own extensive collection of art and Mellon's collection, there was very little for the National Portrait Gallery to display. "To found a portrait gallery in the 1960s," Smithsonian Secretary [[S. Dillon Ripley]] said, was difficult because "American portraiture has already reached the zenith in price and the nadir in supply."<ref name="ThompsonWhoGets" /> Ripley, whose leadership of the Smithsonian began in 1964, was a strong supporter of the new museum, however. He encouraged the museum's curators to build a collection from scratch based on individual pieces chosen through high-quality scholarship rather than buying complete collections from others. The NPG's collection was slowly built over the next five years through donations and purchases. The museum had little money at this time. Often, it located items it wanted and then asked the owner to simply donate it.<ref name="ThompsonWhoGets" />

The first NPG exhibit, "Nucleus for a National Collection," went on display in the [[Arts and Industries Building]] in 1965 (the bicentennial of [[James Smithson]]'s birth). The following year, the NPG completed the Catalog of American Portraits, the first inventory of portraiture held by the Smithsonian. The catalog also documented the physical characteristics of each artwork, and its provenance (author, date, ownership, etc.).<ref name="Siris" /> The museum moved into the Old Patent Office Building with the National Fine Arts Collection in 1966.<ref>Alexander, p. 302.</ref> It opened to the public on October 7, 1968.<ref>Richard, Paul. "A National Family Album." ''Washington Post.'' October 6, 1968; Martin, Judith. "'Semi, Demi-Heroes' Open New Gallery." ''Washington Post.'' October 7, 1968.</ref>

===Building the collection===
The Old Patent Office Building was renovated in 1969 by the architectural firm of Faulkner, Fryer and Vanderpool. The renovation won the American Institute of Architects National Honor Award in 1970.<ref>"Avery C. Faulkner." ''Wilmington Star-News.'' February 25, 2007.</ref> The following year, the NPG began the National Portrait Survey, an attempt to catalog and photograph all portraits in all formats held by every public and private collection and museum in the country. On July 4, 1973, the NPG opened "The Black Presence in the Era of the American Revolution, 1770–1800," the first exhibit at the museum dedicated solely to African Americans. [[Philanthropy|Philanthropist]] [[Paul Mellon]] donated 761 portraits by French-American engraver [[Charles Balthazar Julien Févret de Saint-Mémin|C.B.J.F. de Saint-Mémin]] to the museum in 1974.<ref name="Siris" />

Congress passed legislation in January 1976 allowing the National Portrait Gallery to collect portraits in media other than [[graphic arts]].<ref name="NewFace">Richard, Paul. "A New Face for the Stuffy Old Portrait." ''Washington Post.'' April 3, 1977.</ref> This permitted the NPG to begin collecting photographs. The [[Library of Congress]] had long opposed the move in order to protect its own role in collecting photographs, but NPG Director Marvin Sadik fought hard to have the ban eliminated.<ref name="ThompsonWhoGets" /> The NPG rapidly expanded its photography collection, and in October 1976 established a Department of Photographs. The gallery's first photography exhibit, "Facing the Light: Historic American Portrait Daguerreotypes," opened in September 1978.<ref name="Siris" /> It also continued to build its other collections. In February 1977, the museum acquired an 1880 self-portrait by [[Mary Cassatt]], one of only two painted by her.<ref name="Siris" /> Eleven months later, the museum acquired a self-portrait by [[John Singleton Copley]]. The roundel (a circular canvas), one of only four self-portraits by the celebrated early American artist, was donated to the NPG by the [[Morris Cafritz#Philanthropy|Cafritz Foundation]].<ref name="RichardCopley">Richard, Paul. "American Masterwork: Portrait Gallery's New 'Cornerstone' A Copley Self-Portrait for the Portrait Gallery." ''Washington Post.'' January 16, 1978.</ref>

In May 1978, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine donated 850 original portraits which had graced its cover between 1928 and 1978.<ref>''Permanent Collection Illustrated Checklist'', p. 7.</ref> A major exhibit of these pieces debuted in May 1979.<ref name="Siris" />

===The Stuarts controversy===
[[File:Gilbert Stuart 1796 portrait of Washington.jpg|thumb|The unfinished Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington, one of two portraits at the center of the "Stuarts controversy."]]
A major controversy occurred in 1979 over the National Portrait Gallery's attempt to buy two [[Gilbert Stuart]] paintings.  The famous, unfinished portraits of [[George Washington|George]] and [[Martha Washington]] were owned by the [[Boston Athenaeum]], which loaned them to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] in 1876. But the Athenaeum, a private collection, was suffering from financial difficulties by the late 1970s. It twice offered to sell the two portraits to the Museum of Fine Arts over the previous two years, but the museum declined to purchase them.  The Athenaeum began searching for another buyer, and in early 1979 the Athenaeum tentatively reached an agreement to sell the works to the NPG for $5&nbsp;million.  When the Athenaeum made these discussions public in April 1979, there was strong public opposition to the sale in Boston.<ref>Glueck, Grace. "Athenaeum's Dilemma." ''New York Times.'' April 6, 1979; "Free George and Martha." ''Washington Post.'' April 9, 1979.</ref> NPG director Marvin Sadik declined to cancel the sale, arguing that the portraits were of national historic value and belonged in the Smithsonian.<ref>Richard, Paul. "Marvin Sadik: 'I'm Resolute'." ''Washington Post.'' April 11, 1979.</ref> A campaign by prominent Bostonians tried to raise $5&nbsp;million to keep the portraits in Massachusetts.<ref>Cowen, Peter. "For $5m, Portraits Stay Here." ''Boston Globe.'' April 12, 1979.</ref> [[List of mayors of Boston|Boston Mayor]] [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin H. White]] sued to keep the portraits in Boston, naming [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] [[Francis X. Bellotti]] (whom the state constitution designated "custodian of public property") in the suit. "Everybody knows Washington has no culture—they have to buy it," White said.<ref>Knight, Michael. "Boston City Officials Go to Court to Keep 2 Washington Portraits." ''New York Times.'' April 11, 1979.</ref>

On April 12, the Athenaeum and NPG agreed to delay the sale until December 31, 1979, to give the Boston fund-raising effort a chance.<ref>Richard, Paul. "Bound in Boston." ''Washington Post.'' April 13, 1979.</ref><ref name="falling">"Bostonians Are Falling Short in Drive to Keep Art." ''Associated Press.'' November 25, 1979.</ref> Although not completely successful, the lawsuit had one effect: Attorney General Bellotti announced in mid-summer that the Stuart portraits could not be sold without his permission.<ref name="falling" /> By November 1979, the fund-raising campaign had netted only $885,631, with a pledge from the Museum of Fine Arts to match the amount if necessary.<ref name="falling" /> This left the campaign $4&nbsp;million short of the purchase price. The Athenaeum refused to lower the price, describing the $5&nbsp;million listing as a significant discount from the portraits' real value.<ref>"Portrait Fund Drive Falls $4 Million Short." ''Washington Post.'' January 18, 1980.</ref>

With public and political pressure on the Smithsonian to resolve the issue, the Museum of Fine Arts and NPG agreed on February 7, 1980, to jointly purchase the portraits.  Under the agreement, the paintings would spend three years at the National Portrait Gallery (beginning in July 1980), and then three years in Boston at the Museum of Fine Arts.<ref>"Museums in Capital and Boston to Share Washington Portraits." ''New York Times.'' February 8, 1980; "Museums Come to Terms on Stuarts." ''Washington Post.'' February 23, 1980.</ref> Attorney General Bellotti approved the plan in March.<ref name="StuartsPact">"Pact on Stuarts Approved By Massachusetts Official." ''Associated Press.'' March 22, 1980; "Stuart Portraits Plan Wins Tentative Approval." ''Washington Post.'' March 24, 1980.</ref> Per the agreement, the portraits went on display in Washington on July 1, 1980.<ref>Rosenfeld, Megan. "New Faces in Town." ''Washington Post.'' June 24, 1980; Radcliffe, Donnie. "Back In the Picture." ''Washington Post.'' July 4, 1980.</ref>

NPG director Marvin Sadik, who had expressed his dissatisfaction over the Stuart painting controversy, took a six-month-long sabbatical in January 1981. He announced his retirement from the museum in July.<ref name="SadikRetires" />

===Expanding the collection===
Even as the Stuarts controversy occupied the attention of the press, the National Portrait Gallery continued to expand its collection. In April 1979, it obtained five other portraits by Gilbert Stuart. These five paintings — of presidents George Washington, [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Monroe]], [[John Adams]], and [[James Madison]] — were known as the Gibbs-Coolidge set. The portraits were donated by the Coolidge family of Boston (without controversy).<ref name="GlueckGibbs">Glueck, Grace. "5 Stuarts Go to U.S. Gallery." ''Washington Post.'' April 10, 1979.</ref> In December, the museum obtained a bust of [[Alexander Hamilton]] by [[John Trumbull]] (which may have been sculpted from the portrait which was later used for the $10 bill) and a Gilbert Stuart portrait of [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Fisher Ames]] from the [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] family in Massachusetts.<ref name="RichardLodge">Richard, Paul. "Lodge Donates Two Portraits." ''Washington Post.'' December 15, 1979.</ref> The following April, Varina Webb Stewart and Joel A.H. Webb presented important portraits of [[Jefferson Davis]] and his wife, [[Varina Davis|Varina Howell Davis]], to the National Portrait Gallery. (Stewart and Webb were the Davis' great-grandchildren.)<ref name="Siris" /> In 1980, the museum obtained (through purchase and loan) a number of works by graphic artist [[Howard Chandler Christy]] for exhibit. Works displayed ranged from his "Christy girl" recruiting posters to history-based works such as ''[[Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States]]''.<ref name="Christy">Kernan, Michael. "GEE!! It's Christy." ''Washington Post.'' January 11, 1980; "The Loving Eye That Created the Christy Girl." ''Washington Post.'' January 11, 1980.</ref>

[[File:Lincoln O-118 by Garnder, 1865.jpg|thumb|The "cracked-plate" portrait of Abraham Lincoln, acquired by the NPG as part of the Alexander Gardner Collection.]]
By 1981, the museum had more than 2,000 items in its collection.<ref name="SadikRetires" /> Two major 19th-century photography collections were added by the museum that year. The first such acquisition was the Frederick Hill Meserve Collection of 5,419 glass negatives produced by the studio of famed Civil War photograph [[Mathew Brady]] and his assistants.<ref name="Brady">Ostrow, Joanne. "The Meserves' Photo Legacy." ''Washington Post.'' May 14, 1982.</ref> Using historically accurate chemicals, paper, and techniques, prints were made of the negatives and the prints placed on rotating display. The ''Washington Post'' later described the importance of the acquisition by saying it made the NPG the "epicenter" for Brady scholarship.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline. "The Photographer Who Went to War." ''Washington Post.'' November 7, 2010.</ref> Later that year, 5,400 Civil War-era glass negatives produced by photographer [[Alexander Gardner (photographer)|Alexander Gardner]] were also purchased from the Meserve family. This included the famous "cracked-plate" portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln]] taken in February 1865, which was the last photographic portrait of Lincoln taken before his death in April 1865.<ref name="Siris" />

Two major portrait purchases were also made in the early 1980s. One was a Gilbert Stuart portrait of Thomas Jefferson, for which the museum paid $1&nbsp;million to a private collector. A portion of the purchase price came from the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which owns and operates Jefferson's historic plantation home of [[Monticello]]. The two parties agreed have the portrait spend time at both locations.<ref name="RichardTJ">Richard, Paul. "Gilbert Stuart's Jefferson Acquired for $1 Million." ''Washington Post.'' September 10, 1982.</ref> The second major purchase was an [[Edgar Degas]] portrait of his friend, Mary Cassatt, for which the museum paid $1.3&nbsp;million.<ref name="RichardDegas">Richard, Paul. "Portrait Gallery Buys Degas." ''Washington Post.'' May 22, 1984.</ref>

The museum suffered a major theft in 1984 — although it was not a portrait. On December 31, 1984, a thief pried open a display case and stole four handwritten documents accompanying several portraits of Civil War generals. One of the documents was written and signed by President Abraham Lincoln.  The remaining three were written and signed by Civil War generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[George Meade]], and [[George Armstrong Custer]].  The [[FBI]] was contacted and worked with Smithsonian police to investigate the crime.  Within two weeks, a historic documents dealer contacted the FBI and said he had been offered the documents for sale.  On February 8, 1985, police arrested Norman James Chandler, a part-time mechanic's assistant from Maryland, for the theft. Chandler quickly pleaded guilty. He was sentenced in April 1985 to two years in jail (with all but six months suspended) and two years of probation, and required to pay a $2,000 fine.<ref>"Civil War Era Notes Are Stolen."

''Washington Post.'' February 9, 1985; "Man Sentenced For Stealing Notes From Civil War Era." ''Washington Post.'' April 24, 1985.</ref> All four documents were recovered.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bKFJAAAAIBAJ&pg=3397%2C8042524|title=Man Gets 6 Months for Stealing Documents|work=[[Associated Press]]|date= April 24, 1985|access-date=February 7, 2013}}</ref>

The late 1980s saw the collection continue to expand, although there were fewer major additions.  One significant acquisition was a nude image — a self-portrait painting by Alice Neel acquired in 1985. It was the National Portrait Gallery's first nude work. Neel was 80 years old when she painted it.<ref name="Siris" /> Two years later, noted photographer [[Irving Penn]] donated 120 platinum prints of fashion and celebrity portraits he produced over the past 50 years.<ref name="Grundberg">Grundberg, Andy. "The Beautiful Peoples." ''Washington Post.'' June 19, 2005.</ref>

Two very important [[daguerreotype]]s (an early photographic process) were purchased in the 1990s. The first was of African American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and former slave [[Frederick Douglass]], acquired in 1990. It is one of only four daguerreotypes of Douglass known to exist. That year, the number of images in the museum's photography collection reached 8,500 objects.<ref name="Dagger">"Daguerreotype of Frederick Douglass." ''Washington Post.'' December 23, 1990.</ref> Six years later, the NPG obtained for $115,000 the earliest known daguerreotype of abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], whose [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|1859 raid on Harpers Ferry]] helped to spark the Civil War. The portrait was created by African American photographer [[Augustus Washington]].<ref name="RingleBrown">Ringle, Ken. "John Brown, Captured For History." ''Washington Post.''

===Purchasing the Lansdowne portrait===
[[File:Gilbert Stuart, George Washington (Lansdowne portrait, 1796).jpg|thumb|left|The Lansdowne portrait of George Washington.]]
In the fall of 2000, [[Neil Primrose, 7th Earl of Rosebery]], offered to sell Gilbert Stuart's [[Lansdowne portrait]] of George Washington to the National Portrait Gallery.  The painting was commissioned in April 1796 by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[William Bingham]] of [[Pennsylvania]]—one of the wealthiest men in America at the time. The {{convert|8|by|5|ft|m}} portrait was given as a gift to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|William Petty FitzMaurice]]. FitzMaurice was the 2nd Earl of Shelburne, and later became the first [[Marquess of Lansdowne]] (hence the name of the portrait). Lansdowne died in 1805, and in 1890 the painting was purchased by the 5th Earl of Rosebery. The Lansdowne portrait was displayed only three times in the United States (although several copies remained in America). On its third trip in 1968, it was exhibited by the National Portrait Gallery, and it remained there on indefinite loan. Lord Rosebery offered to sell the painting for $20&nbsp;million, a price at the low end of estimates. But the offer came with a deadline of April 1, 2001. A search for a donor, personally led by Smithsonian Secretary [[Lawrence Small]] and the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, proved fruitless after three months. Worried Smithsonian officials then went public in February 2001 with a plea for a donor to come forth.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline. "Smithsonian Battles to Keep Prized Portrait of Washington." ''Washington Post.'' February 23, 2001.</ref>

On March 13, just two weeks before the sale deadline, the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation donated $30&nbsp;million to buy the Lansdowne portrait. Foundation chairman [[Frederick W. Smith|Fred W. Smith]] read about failing donor effort in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' on February 26. Although the Reynolds Foundation generally only made grants in the areas of elder care, cardiovascular research, and journalism, assisting with the Lansdowne purchase fell within the foundation's "special projects" area of responsibility.<ref>The Reynolds Foundation board had discretion to make grants in areas that presented patriotic or entrepreneurial opportunities or which supported a lifetime interest of foundation founder Donald W. Reynolds.</ref> NPG Director [[Marc Pachter]] flew to [[Nevada]] to meet with foundation officials on March 3, and the foundation approved the donation the following day. The $30&nbsp;million donation included $6&nbsp;million to put the portrait on a national tour for three years (the NPG was closed for renovations until 2006), and $4&nbsp;million to construct a new area in the Old Patent Office Building to display it. NPG said it would name this display area for [[Donald W. Reynolds]], the media baron who created the foundation.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline. "A Washington Bailout." ''Washington Post.'' March 14, 2001.</ref>

===Post-renovation activities===
The National Portrait Gallery closed in January 2000 for a renovation of the Old Patent Office Building.  Intended to take two years and cost $42&nbsp;million, the renovation took seven years and cost $283&nbsp;million. Inflation, delays in obtaining approval for the renovation design, the addition of a glass canopy over the open courtyard, and other issues led to increases in both time and costs. During this period, most of the NPG's collection went on tour around the United States.

In March 2007, a multi-year study of leadership at eight Smithsonian museums made recommendations about the National Portrait Gallery. The report concluded that the museum needed stronger, more visionary leadership intent on creating a truly national museum. The report also called for "administrative consolidation" of the National Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.<ref>Farhi, Paul. "Committee Sees a Lack of Money, Leadership at 8 Smithsonian Museums." ''Washington Post.'' March 21, 2007.</ref>

After the 2008 presidential election, the National Portrait Gallery obtained graphic artist [[Shepard Fairey]]'s ubiquitous "Hope" poster of Barack Obama. Obama supporter [[Tony Podesta]] and his wife, Heather, donated it to the museum.<ref name="FaireyHope">Argetsinger, Amy and Roberts, Roxanne. "Fit for a T: New at the Portrait Gallery." ''Washington Post.'' January 7, 2009.</ref>

===Hide/Seek controversy===
In November 2010, the National Portrait Gallery hosted a major new exhibit, "Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture". The exhibit focused on depictions of homosexual love through history, and was the first exhibit hosted by a museum of national stature to address the topic.<ref>Gopnik, Blake. "'Hide/Seek' Finds a Frame for Showing Sexual Identity." ''Washington Post.'' November 5, 2010.</ref> It was also the largest and most expensive exhibit in the NPG's history, and more private donors contributed to it than to any prior NPG exhibit.<ref name="TrescottRemoves" /> Included in the 105 pieces in the exhibit was a four-minute, edited version of artist [[David Wojnarowicz]]'s short silent film ''A Fire in My Belly''. Eleven seconds of the video depicted a [[crucifix]] covered in ants.<ref name="TrescottRemoves">Trescott, Jacqueline. "Portrait Gallery Removes Crucifix Video From Exhibit After Complaints." ''Washington Post.'' December 1, 2010.</ref>

The exhibit was scheduled to run from October 30, 2010, to February 13, 2011. Within days of its opening, [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] president [[William Anthony Donohue|William A. Donohue]] labeled ''Fire in My Belly'' "hate speech," anti-Catholic, and anti-Christian. A spokesperson for Representative [[John Boehner]], incoming [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], called it an "arrogant" abuse of the public trust and a misuse of taxpayer money, although it was funded by private donations.<ref name="TrescottRemoves" /><ref>Almost no taxpayer money was spent on the exhibit, since it was funded by private donations.</ref> [[Leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] Representative [[Eric Cantor]] threatened to reduce the Smithsonian's budget if the film remained on view.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline. "Clough Defends Removal of Video". ''Washington Post.'' January 19, 2011.</ref> After consulting with National Portrait Gallery director Martin Sullivan, co-curator David C. Ward (but not with co-curator [[Jonathan David Katz]]),<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline. "After Smithsonian Exhibit's Removal, Banned Ant Video Still Creeps Into Gallery." ''Washington Post.'' December 6, 2010.</ref> Smithsonian Undersecretary Richard Kurin, and the Smithsonian's government affairs and public relations offices, Smithsonian Secretary [[G. Wayne Clough]] ordered ''Fire in My Belly'' removed from the exhibit on November 30.<ref name="TrescottRemoves" />

Clough's decision led to extensive accusations of censorship and claims that the Smithsonian was caving in to pressure from a small group of vocal activists. Smithsonian officials strongly defended the video's removal. "The decision wasn't caving in," said Sullivan. "We don't want to shy away from anything that is controversial, but we want to focus on the museum's and this show's strengths."<ref name="TrescottRemoves" /> Kurin expressed the Smithsonian's desire to be responsive to public opinion, but also emphasized the remaining exhibit's importance. "We are sensitive to what the public thinks about our shows and programs," he said. "We stand behind the show. It has strong scholarship with great pieces by artists who are recognized by a whole panoply of experts. It represents a segment of America."<ref name="TrescottRemoves" /> On December 13, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, one of the principal sponsors of the exhibit, said it would ask for its $100,000 donation back if the film was not restored. Clough replied, "...the Smithsonian's decision to remove the video was a difficult one and we stand by it." The donation was returned, and the Warhol Foundation ceased to support National Portrait Gallery exhibits.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline. "'Hide/Seek' Sponsor Threatens to Cut Funding for Smithsonian." ''Washington Post.'' December 14, 2010; Taylor, Kate. "Foundation Says It's Ending Smithsonian Support." ''New York Times.'' December 13, 2010.</ref> The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, which donated $10,000 to support the exhibit, also ended all funding for future Smithsonian exhibitions. Both decisions drew criticism from some gay rights supporters, who felt the funding cuts were too draconian in view of the fact that the remainder of the pieces continued to be exhibited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/visual-arts/2010/12/17/mapplethorpe-foundation-withdraws-support-for-smithsonian-exhibitions/|author=Capps, Kriston|title=Mapplethorpe Foundation Withdraws Support for Smithsonian Exhibitions|website=[[Washington City Paper]]|date= December 17, 2010|access-date=February 6, 2013}}</ref>

The controversy lasted through the exhibit's scheduled run. In late January 2011, the Smithsonian Board of Regents unanimously gave Clough a vote of confidence, saying his accomplishments in improving the Smithsonian's administration, finances, governance, and maintenance in the past 19 months far outweighed the damage done by the "Hide/Seek" controversy. Clough admitted, however, that he may have acted too hastily in the matter (although he continued to say he made the right decision), and the regents asked for Smithsonian staff to study the controversy and report back on how to handle such events in the future. Not everyone in the Smithsonian agreed with the regents. The ''Washington Post'' reported that some (unnamed) Smithsonian museum directors and curators felt there would be a "[[Chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]]" from Clough's decision. The Board of Directors of the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] wrote an [[open letter]] to Clough in which they said they were "deeply troubled by the precedent" to remove the film.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline.

=== Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition ===
<!--- linked from redirect [[Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition]] --->
In 2006, the museum began hosting a triennial, juried contemporary portrait exhibition called the Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition.  Named after long time docent and volunteer Virginia Outwin Boochever, this competition is widely regarded as the most prestigious [[portrait]] competition in the [[United States]].  Artists working in the fields of [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]], and other media are allowed to enter.<ref>Gopnik, Blake. "Portrait Capital." ''Washington Post.''

===Post-2010 exhibits of note===
In 2012, the National Portrait Gallery sponsored a new temporary exhibit, "Poetic Likeness: Modern American Poets," which focused on images of great American poets. The NPG collection had grown so large that the exhibit drew its images almost entirely from the museum's own collection.<ref>Kennicott, Philip. "American Poets, On the Surface." ''Washington Post.'' November 4, 2012.</ref>

==Collection==
[[File:Gibbs-Coolidge Collection - 1817 to 1821 - by Gilbert Stuart - National Gallery of Art, Washington DC.jpg|thumb|The Gibbs-Coolidge Set, five oil paintings on wood of the first five Presidents, by Gilbert Stuart. The set was acquired by NPG in 1979.]]
As of 2011, the National Portrait Gallery was the only museum in the United States dedicated solely to portraiture.<ref name="Schultz" /> The museum had 65 employees and a $9&nbsp;million annual budget in 2013. By February 2013, it housed 21,200 works of art, which had been seen by 1,069,932 visitors in 2012.<ref name="SIFactSheet" />

===Portrait addition procedure===
By 1977, the National Portrait Gallery had three curatorial divisions:  Painting and sculpture, prints and drawings, and photography.<ref name="ThompsonWhoGets" />

Initially, the National Portrait Gallery had fairly strict rules regarding which images could enter its collection. The person depicted had to be historically significant. An individual also needed to be dead at least 10 years before their portrait could be displayed (although some images of obviously important living people were acquired while they still lived). After an initial affirmative determination by curators at a monthly curatorial meeting, the National Portrait Gallery Commission (the museum's board of directors) approved the person's inclusion. The commission was initially quite conservative in its assessment of "historically significant," although this position began to be more relaxed by 1969.<ref name="ThompsonWhoGets" /> As of 2006, the definition of "historically significant" had become quite loose, although "some kind of fame or notoriety remains a prerequisite". Portraits of living individuals or those dead less than 10 years are also now allowed to be displayed in the museum, as long as their inclusion is clearly important (such as presidents or generals).<ref name="ThompsonNow">Thompson, Bob. "The Changing Face of American Portraiture." ''Washington Post.'' June 25, 2006.</ref><ref name="TrescottNewView">Trescott, Jacqueline. "Museums Reopen to a Brand-New View." ''Washington Post.'' July 1, 2006.</ref>

The process for choosing which images the museum acquires is simple but can be contentious. Potential acquisitions are vigorously and informally discussed at length by researchers, historians, and the curatorial departments. Some of the criteria used in the decision-making process are: The number of existing portraits of the individual already in the collection, the quality of the potential portrait, the uniqueness of the potential portrait, the reputation of the portrait's author, and the cost of the portrait. Formal decisions to acquire a portrait are made at monthly curatorial meetings, then ratified by the National Portrait Gallery Commission.<ref name="ThompsonWhoGets" />

===Key exhibits and programs of the museum===
[[File:Joseph Siffrein Duplessis - Benjamin Franklin - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Benjamin Franklin'' (1785) by Joseph Duplessis, given to the NPG by the Cafritz Foundation in 1987.]]
[[File:Motto frederick douglass 2.jpg|thumb|Frederick Douglass (1856), daguerreotype by an unknown author, acquired by the NPG in 1990.]]
A hallmark of the National Portrait Gallery's permanent collection is the Hall of Presidents, which contains portraits of nearly all American presidents. It is the largest and most complete collection in the world, except for the [[White House]] collection itself.<ref name="Copeland">Copeland, Libby. "The Clintons: They've Been Framed!" ''Washington Post.'' April 25, 2006.</ref> The centerpiece of the Hall of Presidents is the famous [[Lansdowne portrait]] of George Washington. How the museum obtains presidential images has changed over the years. Presidential portraits from 1962 to 1987 were usually obtained through purchase or donation. Beginning in 1998, NPG began commissioning portraits of presidents, starting with [[George H. W. Bush]]. In 2000, NPG began commissioning portraits of First Ladies as well, beginning with [[Hillary Clinton]]. Funds for these commissions are privately raised, and each portrait costs about $150,000 to $200,000.<ref name="Copeland" />

==Building==
{{main|Old Patent Office Building}}
[[File:USA-National Portrait Gallery0.jpg|thumb|left|National Portrait Gallery]]
[[File:National Portrait Gallery courtyard DC1.jpg|thumb|The Robert and Arlene Kogod Courtyard at the National Portrait Gallery.]]
The National Portrait Gallery occupies a portion of the Old Patent Office Building, a [[National Historic Landmark]]. The building is located just south of [[Chinatown, Washington, D.C.|Chinatown]] in downtown Washington. Constructed between 1836 and 1867,<ref>Price and Price, p. 102; Silber, p. 61; [https://books.google.com/books?id=YEgNAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22Patent%20Office%20Building%22%20completed%201867&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q=%22Patent%20Office%20Building%22%20completed%201867&f=false Acker, p. 14], accessed 2013-02-08.</ref> the building has a [[sandstone]] and [[marble]] façade,<ref>Ross, p. 87.</ref> and [[portico]]es modeled after the [[Parthenon]].<ref>Sandler, p. 51.</ref>

The building was used as a hospital during the American Civil War, and both [[Clara Barton]] and [[Walt Whitman]] worked as nurses there.<ref>Dale, p. 47.</ref> The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], the [[General Land Office]], and the [[Bureau of Pensions]] jointly occupied the building with the Patent Office through the Civil War and into the post-war period.<ref>Fixico, p. 27; Bureau of Land Management, p. 25; National Park Service, p. 8.</ref> The massive increase in pension processing required by the Civil War led to the construction of a new [[National Building Museum|Pension Bureau Building]] into which the Bureau of Pensions moved in 1887.<ref>Moeller and Feldblyum, p. 100.</ref> The General Land Office and the Bureau of Indian Affairs vacated the building in 1898.<ref>Secretary of the Interior, 1899, p. 107.</ref> The [[United States Civil Service Commission]] and the [[Government Accountability Office|Government Accounting Office]] occupied the building after the Patent Office vacated it in 1932.<ref>Public Buildings Commission, p. 24-27.</ref> The Government Accounting Office vacated the structure in 1942, after its new headquarters nearby was complete.<ref>Committee on Appopriations, p. 466.</ref> The Civil Service Commission began constructing its own headquarters, and planned to vacate the building in 1962.<ref>Select Subcommittee on Education, p. 159.</ref>

Local D.C. businessmen asked the General Services Administration (GSA) to tear down the building and sell the land so a private parking garage could be built on the centrally located site. Legislation for this purpose was introduced in Congress in the waning days of the [[82nd United States Congress]] in 1952, but did not pass. The legislation encountered resistance from a few members of Congress, architects, and the influential [[Committee of 100 on the Federal City]] (a non-profit advocate for responsible planning and land use).<ref>"Sen. Maybanks Fights Plan to Raze CSC Building." ''Washington Post.'' November 17, 1953; "Architects Fight Plan to Raze CSC Building." ''Washington Post.'' February 24, 1954; "Committee Protests Razing Plan." ''Washington Post.'' December 17, 1955.</ref> GSA reversed course and said in June 1956 it no longer wanted to demolish the building. However, the agency said it would continue to use it for federal office space (which was in short supply) until the Civil Service Commission vacated the structure.<ref>"GSA Wants to Preserve Patent Bldg." ''Washington Post.'' June 3, 1956.</ref> On March 21, 1958, Congress unanimously passed legislation authorizing the transfer of the building to the Smithsonian for a national art museum.<ref>"CSC Building to Become Art Museum." ''Washington Post.'' March 22, 1958.</ref> President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] signed the legislation a few days later.<ref>Sampson, Paul. "Exhibit to Tell American Art Story." Washington Post.'' April 2, 1958.</ref>

Congress passed legislation establishing the National Portrait Gallery in 1962, and the Civil Service Commission moved out of the structure in November 1963.<ref>Doolittle, Jerry. "Civil Service Dedicates Home." ''Washington Post.'' November 13, 1963.</ref> Preparations for the renovation began in November 1964,<ref>Scott, David W. "Patent Building to Become Arty."

===2000 to 2007 renovation===
In 1995, the Smithsonian revealed that the Old Patent Office Building was in serious disrepair.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline. "The Dilapidated State of the Nation's Attic." ''Washington Post.'' June 10, 1995.</ref> The Smithsonian announced in January 1997 that the building would close in January 2000 for a two-year, $42&nbsp;million renovation. Hartman-Cox Architects was hired to oversee the conservation and repair.<ref>Lewis, Jo Ann. "Repairs to Close Two Art Museums." ''Washington Post.'' January 29, 1997.</ref> But just three years later, as the renovation was about to begin, the cost of repairs had risen to $110&nbsp;million to $120&nbsp;million.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline. "Extensive Leaks In the Nation's Attic." ''Washington Post.'' April 1, 2000.</ref>

Prior to the building's closure in January 2000, a decision was reached to allot about one-third of the building's total space to the National Portrait Gallery while simultaneously eliminating the informal north–south division between the NPG and American Art Museum.<ref>Forgey, Benjamin. "The Old Patent Office, Pending Renewal." ''Washington Post.'' January 1, 2000.</ref> This led to acrimony between the two museums, and a public debate about which collection deserved more space. The Smithsonian resolved the dispute practically: Art that best fit an exhibition space got it. (For example, since modern art often tends toward large canvases, this art is on the high-ceilinged third floor.)<ref name="TrescottNewView" />

The cost of the renovation rose to $180&nbsp;million by March 2001. That month, Nan Tucker McEvoy (a [[California]] newspaper heiress and arts patron) donated $10&nbsp;million for the renovation.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline. "Smithsonian Art Museum Gets Second $10 Million." ''Washington Post.'' March 7, 2001.</ref> The Henry Luce Foundation gave another $10&nbsp;million later that year.<ref name="TrescottBoost">Trescott, Jacqueline. "Old Patent Office Gets A $25 Million Boost." ''Washington Post.'' November 16, 2004.</ref> Costs continued to rise. Although Congress appropriated $33.5&nbsp;million for the renovation, reconstruction costs were estimated at $214&nbsp;million in June 2001 and the museum not scheduled to reopen until 2005.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline. "Smithsonian Projects Face Delays." ''Washington Post.'' June 23, 2001.</ref> Just a month later, the reopening was pushed back even further to July 2006.<ref>Forgey, Benjamin. "Naked Splendor." ''Washington Post.'' July 20, 2003.</ref>

In 2003, the government increased its contribution to $166&nbsp;million. Smithsonian officials subsequently began discussing a major change to the renovation design:  Adding a glass roof to the open courtyard in the center of the Old Patent Office Building. Congress approved the change in August 2003. In March 2004, the Smithsonian announced that architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], would design the glass canopy.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://info.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek07/1221/1221d_portrait.cfm| title=Museum Courtyard Glides Through the Ages| author=Zach Mortice| journal=AIArchitect| date=December 21, 2007| access-date=September 17, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101143017/http://info.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek07/1221/1221d_portrait.cfm| archive-date=January 1, 2013| url-status=dead}}; {{cite news | url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-07-02/travel/17302105_1_museums-marc-pachter-national-mall | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Edward | last=Epstein | title=Openings THU 13 Cesar Chavez Student | date=2006-07-02 }}; Trescott, Jacqueline.

Smith Construction fortune) donated $25&nbsp;million to complete the canopy. By then, costs had risen to $298&nbsp;million. $60&nbsp;million in private funds still needed to be raised.<ref name="TrescottBoost" /> Today, the Kogod Courtyard is a popular meeting place in DC. There is plenty of seating, free wifi, and a cafe<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://npg.si.edu/visit/courtyard-cafe|title=The Courtyard Café|last=sysadmin|date=2015-08-21|website=npg.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> with snacks for museum visitors open from 11:30 am until 6:30 pm.

Design approval for the canopy proved difficult. The design had to be approved by the [[National Capital Planning Commission]] (NCPC), which has statutory authority to approve all buildings and renovations in the D.C. metropolitan area. Although the NCPC approved the preliminary design,<ref name="TrescottBoost" /> the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), the [[United States Department of the Interior]], the D.C. State Preservation Office, and the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] all opposed the enclosure of the courtyard.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline. "Patent Office Roof: Pending." ''Washington Post.'' April 25, 2005.</ref> The NCPC reversed its preliminary approval on June 2, 2005.<ref name="ForgeyRejects">Forgey, Benjamin. "Panel Rejects Smithsonian Plan For Patent Office."

''Washington Post.''

Attendance at the renovated building rose significantly to 214,495 in just two months. In the past, both museums had drawn just 450,000 over 12 months. The achievement was even more impressive in the face of flat or declining attendance at all other Smithsonian museums.<ref>Trescott, Jacqueline. "Smithsonian Attendance Down." ''Washington Post.'' September 20, 2006.</ref> The higher attendance was not all positive. Some patrons spit on art they did not like, while others kissed or touched some paintings. Video security cameras were hastily installed in September 2007 to stop the vandalism.<ref>Grimaldi, James V.
