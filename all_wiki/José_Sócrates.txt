'''José Sócrates Carvalho Pinto de Sousa''', [[Order of Prince Henry|GCIH]] (born 6 September 1957), commonly known as '''José Sócrates''' ({{IPA-pt|ʒuˈzɛ ˈsɔkɾɐtɨʃ}}), is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] politician who was the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]] from 12 March 2005 to 21 June 2011. For the second half of 2007, he acted as the [[President of the European Council|President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union]].

Sócrates grew up in the industrial city of [[Covilhã]]. He joined the centre-left [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] in 1981 and was elected Member of [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Parliament]] in [[1987 Portuguese legislative election|1987]]. Sócrates entered the government in 1995, as Secretary of State for Environment in the first cabinet of [[António Guterres]]. Two years later, he became Minister of Youth and Sports (where he helped to organize Portugal's successful bid to host [[UEFA Euro 2004]]) and in 1999 became Minister for Environment. Sócrates prominence rose during the governments of António Guterres to the point that when the Prime Minister resigned in 2001, he considered to appoint Sócrates as his successor.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.publico.pt/2013/11/10/jornal/antonio-guterres-admite-que-via-socrates-como-seu-sucessor-no-governo-27380971 |title=António Guterres admite que via Sócrates como seu sucessor no Governo |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=10 November 2013 |newspaper=Público |language=pt |trans-title=António Guterres stated that he saw Sócrates as his successor in the government |access-date=24 August 2018 }}</ref>

In opposition, José Sócrates was elected leader of the Socialist Party in 2004 and led the party to its first absolute majority in the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|2005 election]]. By then, Portugal was living an economic crisis, marked by stagnation and a difficult state of public finances. Like the preceding centre-right government, Sócrates implemented a policy of fiscal austerity and structural reforms.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.publico.pt/2005/06/09/politica/noticia/socialistas-procuram-digerir-medidas-de-austeridade-anunciadas-pelo-governo-1225357 |title=Socialistas procuram digerir medidas de austeridade anunciadas pelo Governo |last=Augusto Moreira |first=José |date=9 June 2005 |newspaper=Público |language=pt |trans-title=Socialists try to digest the austerity measures announced by the government |access-date=24 August 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Cambon |first=Diane |date=27 June 2008 |title=Budget, impôts, retraite : la leçon d'austérité du Portugal |trans-title=Bugdet, taxes, reforms: Portugal's lesson of austerity |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/economie/2008/06/27/04001-20080627ARTFIG00357-budget-impots-retraite-la-lecon-d-austerite-du-portugal.php |language=fr |newspaper=Le Figaro |access-date=24 August 2018 }}</ref> Among the most important reforms were the 2007 Social Security reform and the 2009 labour law reform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/portugal/europa/reforma-da-seguranca-social-aprovada-na-generalidade |title=Reforma da Segurança Social aprovada na generalidade |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=23 November 2006 |publisher=TVI24 |language=pt |trans-title=Social Security reform approved at first reading |access-date=24 August 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cardoso |first1=Daniel |last2=Branco |first2=Rui |date=March 2017 |title=Labour Market Reforms and the Crisis in Portugal: No change, U-Turn or New Departure? |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313376708 |journal=IPRI Working Paper 56/2017 |pages=8–9 |doi=10.23906/wp56/2017 |access-date=24 August 2018 }}</ref> His government also restructured the provision of public services, closing thousands of elementary schools<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.dn.pt/portugal/interior/socrates-era-criminoso-nao-encerrar-escolas-1586489.html |title=Sócrates: "Era criminoso" não encerrar escolas |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=5 June 2010 |newspaper=Diário de Notícias |language=pt |trans-title=Sócrates: “It would be criminal” to not close schools |access-date=24 August 2018 }}</ref> and dozens of health care facilities and maternity wards in rural areas and small cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/centro-de-saude/46-centros-de-saude-com-horarios-alterados |title=46 centros de saúde com horários alterados |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2 January 2009 |publisher=TVI24 |language=pt |trans-title=46 primary care centres with changed timetables |access-date=24 August 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://cabodostrabalhos.ces.uc.pt/pdf/17_Ana_Raquel_Matos.pdf |title="De longe se faz "parto"!"

==Biography==

===Early years===
José Sócrates was born in [[Porto]] on 6 September 1957, and was registered as a newborn in [[Vilar de Maçada]], [[Alijó]] municipality, in northeastern Portugal, since the locality was his family ancestral homeland. However, the young José Sócrates lived throughout his childhood and teen years with his father, a divorced [[building designer]], in the city of [[Covilhã]], [[Cova da Beira Subregion|Cova da Beira subregion]], in central inland Portugal, in the [[Centro region]]. His parents are Fernando Pinto de Sousa ([[Vilar de Maçada]], [[Alijó]], 15 November 1926 – [[Oporto]], 18 July 2011)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dn.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=1915211 |title=Morreu o pai de José Sócrates |newspaper=[[Diário de Notícias]] |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=5 January 2015 |language=pt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105034720/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=1915211 |archive-date=5 January 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref> and wife and remote relative Maria Adelaide de Carvalho Monteiro (b. [[Vilar de Maçada]], Alijó, 8 October 1931). He has two younger siblings, António Carvalho Pinto de Sousa, born circa 1962, and Ana Maria Carvalho Pinto de Sousa, died in 1988. He is a descendant of the illegitimate daughter of António José Girão Teixeira Lobo Barbosa (Porto, [[Sé (Porto)|Sé]], 9 January 1715 – Alijó, Vilar de Maçada), [[Fidalgo]] of the [[Royal Household]] and [[Knight]] of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=312711 |title=José Sócrates Carvalho Pinto de Sousa in a Portuguese genealogical website |publisher=Geneall.net |date=15 November 1926 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}</ref>

===Education===
José Sócrates studied in [[Covilhã]]'s basic and secondary schools, until the age of 18. Then, in 1975, he went to [[Coimbra]] in order to attend a higher education institution. He earned in 1979 his 4-year ''bacharelato''<ref>The Portuguese ''bacharelato'' degree awarded by polytechnical institutions or its predecessors, was not a bachelor's degree – it was one step below. Only the ''licenciatura'' degree was equal to the bachelor's degree.

===Political career===
José Sócrates was one of the founders of JSD (the youth branch of PSD – [[Portuguese Social Democratic Party]]) before changing his political affiliation and applying for membership in the PS – [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]]. He has been a member of the Socialist Party since 1981. José Sócrates served as a technical engineer for the [[Covilhã]] City Council, and has been elected a member of the Portuguese Parliament since 1987, representing the [[Castelo Branco (district)|Castelo Branco]] electoral district. While serving as the chairperson of the Castelo Branco Federation of the Socialist Party (1983–1996), he was elected to the Party's National Secretariat in 1991. José Sócrates was ousted by the Board of the [[Guarda Municipality, Portugal|Guarda Municipality]] in 1990 and 1991, after being warned several times because of poor quality of construction projects and lack of monitoring of the construction works. Sócrates was threatened with disciplinary action for wrongdoings in the technical direction of particular works of whose projects he was the author, but despite being ousted from this capacity, he was never penalized. In addition, as a [[Member of the Parliament]], Sócrates was not allowed by law to work as a [[technical engineer]] between 1987 and 1991.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} José António Cerejo, [http://www.publico.pt/Política/socrates-assinou-21-projectos-de-casas-quando-era-exclusivo-na-ar_1430777 Sócrates assinou 21 projectos de casas quando era exclusivo na AR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316045501/http://www.publico.pt/Pol%C3%ADtica/socrates-assinou-21-projectos-de-casas-quando-era-exclusivo-na-ar_1430777 |date=16 March 2012 }}, [[Público (newspaper)|Público]] (5 April 2010)</ref> From 1989 to 1996, he served as a member of the Covilhã Municipal Assembly. He served as spokesperson on environmental affairs for the Socialist Party from 1991 to 1995. In 1995, he entered government as secretary of state for Environment in the first government of [[António Guterres]]. Two years later, Sócrates became Minister for Youth and Sports and was one of the organizers of the [[EURO 2004]] cup in Portugal. He became Minister for Environment in Guterres' second government in 1999. Following the elections of 2002 (won by [[José Manuel Durão Barroso]]), Sócrates became a member of the opposition in the [[Portuguese Parliament]]. Meanwhile, he also had a program of political analysis, hosted jointly with [[Pedro Santana Lopes]] on [[Radiotelevisão Portuguesa|RTP]]. After the resignation of [[Ferro Rodrigues]] as party leader in 2004, he won a bid for the post of secretary-general against [[Manuel Alegre]] and [[João Soares (politician)|João Soares]], winning the vote of nearly 80% of party members on 24 September 2004. After the victory of his party in the [[2005 Portuguese Parliament election|2005 Portuguese election]], Sócrates was called on 24 February by president [[Jorge Sampaio]] to form a new government – the 17th Constitutional Government ([[Constitution of Portugal|after 1976]]). After the [[Portuguese legislative election of 2009]], held on 27 September 2009, José Sócrates was elected for a second term as Prime Minister of Portugal. He was also a Member of the [[Portuguese Council of State]] as the Prime-Minister.

===Personal life===

====Family and residence====
Sócrates is divorced from Sofia Costa Pinto Fava,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=312712 |title=Sofia Costa Pinto Fava in a Portuguese genealogical website |publisher=Geneall.net |accessdate=26 March 2011}}</ref> an engineer, with whom he has two sons, José Miguel Fava Pinto de Sousa (b. 1993) and Eduardo Fava Pinto de Sousa (b. 1995). Sofia is a daughter of José Manuel Carvalho Fava, an architect, and Clotilde Mesquita (daughter of Armando Mesquita and Palmira da Costa Pinto), engineer and sister of Alexandre Mesquita Carvalho Fava and Mara Mesquita Carvalho Fava. Sócrates lives in Lisbon, although he used to be a registered elector of the municipality of [[Covilhã]], the place where he voted until the law was changed (since after the mid-2000s every person votes in one's residential area).

====Health and well-being====
José Sócrates had photos of himself taken during his morning [[jogging|jog]] at places like the [[Red Square]] in Moscow, Rio de Janeiro's [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]], [[Luanda]], and [[Lisbon]]. In January 2008, a smoking ban came into force in Portugal's public buildings and on public transport, but Sócrates was reported to have been smoking in May during a private state flight to [[Venezuela]] where he met [[Hugo Chávez]]. He has since admitted it was a mistake, apologized and promised to quit smoking. In addition, he claimed he was not aware he was breaking the law when he did so.<ref>João Marcelino [https://dn.sapo.pt/2008/05/15/editorial/o_e_o_exemplos_dados_jose_socrates.html O mau e o bom exemplos dados por José Sócrates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305224745/http://dn.sapo.pt/2008/05/15/editorial/o_e_o_exemplos_dados_jose_socrates.html |date=5 March 2009 }}, ''[[Diário de Notícias]]'', 15 May 2008</ref> However, by 2012, after he had left the spotlight, the Portuguese newspaper ''Diário de Notícias'' reported he was no longer a non-smoker.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130416134040/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/pessoas/interior.aspx?content_id=2595228 José Sócrates de férias almoça em hotel de Lisboa], ''[[Diário de Notícias]]'' (6 June 2012)</ref>

==Prime Minister of Portugal==
After the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 2005]], Sócrates was called on 24 February by president [[Jorge Sampaio]] to form a new government. Sócrates and his first government (''XVII Governo Constitucional'') took office on 12 March 2005.

After the [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 2009]], held on 27 September 2009, José Sócrates was elected for a second term as [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]. The new government was sworn into office on 26 October 2009.

On 5 June 2011, after the [[2011 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 2011]], the victory of [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] ({{lang-pt|Partido Social Democrata}}) led by [[Pedro Passos Coelho]], forced his resignation as Secretary-General of the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]].

===Sócrates government===
Sócrates headed the government beginning on 12 March 2005, comprising the XVII and XVIII ''Governos Constitucionais'' (17th and 18th Constitutional Governments).

====Major policies====

=====Administrative reforms=====
[[File:Dilma Rousseff and Jose Socrates 2011.JPG|thumb|José Sócrates and [[President of Brazil|President]] [[Dilma Rousseff]] in 2011]]

The XVII ''Governo Constitucional'' government, headed by Prime Minister José Sócrates, tried to create new rules and implement reforms aiming at better efficiency and rationalized resource allocation in the [[public sector]], fighting civil servant overcapacity (''excedentários'') and reducing bureaucracy for both citizens and companies (e.g.: ''empresa na hora'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empresanahora.pt/ |title=Empresa na Hora |publisher=Empresanahora.pt |date=29 September 2006 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}</ref> ''PRACE – Programa de Reestruturação da Administração Central do Estado'',<ref>[http://www.portugal.gov.pt/NR/rdonlyres/0A6DEBBD-BE35-4C4C-91CA-27BCF76E142A/0/Modelo_PRACE.pdf PRACE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926034403/http://www.portugal.gov.pt/NR/rdonlyres/0A6DEBBD-BE35-4C4C-91CA-27BCF76E142A/0/Modelo_PRACE.pdf |date=26 September 2007 }}</ref> and SIMPLEX – Programa de Simplificação Administrativa e Legislativa),<ref>[http://www.ucma.gov.pt/simplex/ Simplex] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713151050/http://www.ucma.gov.pt/simplex/ |date=13 July 2007 }}</ref> among others. Since the XVII ''Governo Constitucional'' government (with José Sócrates as Prime Minister and [[Teixeira dos Santos]] as Minister of Finance) Portugal's fiscal policy improved with a steady increase of the number of taxpayers and the growth of the receipt amount from State taxation. However these policies had little effect, and the country's public debt and deficit were both out of control by 2010, along with a record high unemployment rate. João Bilhim directed in 2005 the committee responsible for the Programme for Restructuring the State's Central Administration (PRACE) but was said to be disappointed with the results.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} Raquel Martins, [http://economia.publico.pt/Noticia/reforma-do-estado-nao-resolveu-problema-do-numero-de-funcionarios_1430782 Reforma do Estado não resolveu problema do número de funcionários], [[Público (newspaper)|Público]] (5 April 2010)</ref> Several reforms and measures implemented in 2006/2007 by the government (XVII ''Governo Constitucional'' – headed by Prime Minister José Sócrates), resulted in improved welfare system financial sustainability but reduced income expectations of future pensioners up to 40%.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} Eugénio Rosa, [http://resistir.info/e_rosa/reducao_pensoes.html Previsões erradas do governo justificam redução das pensões de reforma], "factor de sustentabilidade, determinará, só ele, uma redução muito grande nos valores das pensões dos trabalhadores que se reformarem no futuro que poderá atingir −20%", "medidas que determinarão, no futuro, uma redução dos valores das pensões de reforma que poderão atingir −40% segundo a OCDE"</ref> In addition, economically active people must work for more years before retirement than formerly.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} Manuel Esteves, [https://dn.sapo.pt/2008/01/21/economia/idade_reforma_cresce_a_dois_anos_203.html Idade de reforma cresce um a dois anos até 2030] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029193542/http://dn.sapo.pt/2008/01/21/economia/idade_reforma_cresce_a_dois_anos_203.html |date=29 October 2008 }}, ''[[Diário de Notícias]]''</ref> A sustainability factor was also introduced, giving employees the option of working longer or receiving slightly lower pensions, as life expectancy forecasts increase. After the [[1998 Portuguese regionalisation referendum|Portuguese regionalization referendum of 1998]] where the "No" to regionalization of the mainland into eight administrative regions was victorious, the XVII ''Governo Constitucional'' government announced in January 2009<ref>[http://ww1.rtp.pt/noticias/?article=383362&visual=26&tema=1 Regionalização: PS/Porto elogia José Sócrates por ter assumido a sua proposta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314101354/http://ww1.rtp.pt/noticias/?article=383362&visual=26&tema=1 |date=14 March 2012 }}, [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal]] (19 January 2009)</ref> its firm intention of starting again a [[regionalization]] process for Portugal. According to this governmental project, [[mainland Portugal]] was to be regionalized into five regions with a wide range of administrative autonomy, using the already established [[NUTS II]] system: [[Alentejo Region|Alentejo]], [[Algarve Region|Algarve]], [[Lisboa e Vale do Tejo|Lisbon and Tagus Valley]], [[Centro region|Central Portugal]] and [[Norte Region, Portugal|Northern Portugal]]. The transformation of the Portuguese public administration from a traditional one to an information technology-based multiplatform service, was praised by the [[European Commission]] through its European Union benchmark for the sector, that consecutively placed Portugal in the first position of the ranking in 2009 and 2010.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://www.dn.pt/inicio/economia/interior.aspx?content_id=1789294 Portugal em 1.° lugar nos serviços públicos electrónicos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928001439/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/economia/interior.aspx?content_id=1789294 |date=28 September 2011 }}, ''[[Diário de Notícias]]'' (21 February 2011)</ref>

=====Technological plan=====
[[File:HelderCiscoPortugal.jpg|thumb|right|Chris Dedicoat, [[Helder Antunes]], and Sócrates at the 2008 [[Cisco]] Portugal Official Inauguration.]]
One of the government's main policies was the ''Plano Tecnológico'' (Technological Plan), aimed at increasing Portugal's competitivity through the modernization of [[Economy of Portugal|its economy]]. The plan consisted of three key areas: knowledge, technology and innovation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planotecnologico.pt/default.aspx?idLang=2&site=planotecnologico |title=Technological Plan – Innovating Portugal |publisher=Planotecnologico.pt |date=16 June 2009 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318010833/http://www.planotecnologico.pt/default.aspx?idLang=2&site=planotecnologico |archive-date=18 March 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> A [[low-cost]] [[Intel]]-based [[netbook]] for use by children announced by Sócrates's government cabinet, named ''Magalhães'' (after [[Fernão de Magalhães]]) and packaged and assembled for the Portuguese school-age children and the low-to-middle income economy export market by the Portuguese company J.P. Sá Couto, headquartered in [[Matosinhos]], [[Norte Region, Portugal|Norte region]], was among the government's innovations under the Technological Plan. Governmental efforts in the technological domain also included state support of a Portuguese factory that was owned by the German-based semiconductor company [[Qimonda AG]], in [[Vila do Conde]], [[Norte Region, Portugal|Norte region]], when the parent company filed a bankruptcy petition with the local court in [[Munich]], Germany, in early 2009. Qimonda Portugal was at the time one of the top Portuguese net exporters of technology.<ref>[http://www.itworld.com/business/61315/dram-maker-qimonda-files-bankruptcy DRAM maker Qimonda files for bankruptcy], ITWorld (23 January 2009)</ref>

The [[European Innovation Scoreboard]] of 2010 placed Portugal-based innovation in 15th position, as a result of an impressive increase in innovation expenditure and output.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://economia.publico.pt/Noticia/portugal-ganha-terreno-no-ranking-da-inovacao_1478035 Portugal ganha terreno no ranking da inovação], [[Público (Portugal)|Público]] (1 February 2011)</ref>

=====Educational reforms=====
The government allocated more resources for education policy and reorganised the sector aiming more choice and better quality in vocational technical education. Enhanced and improved vocational technical education programs were implemented in 2007 in an effort to revitalize this sector which had been almost discontinued after the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974. Other education reforms included more financial support for students (in all educational levels), systematic teaching and school evaluation, the compulsory closing of some problematic and unreliable private higher education institutions (like the [[Independente University]] and [[Moderna University]]) by the Minister for Science, Technology and Higher Education, [[Mariano Gago]], and a will to rank and benchmark the higher education institutions through a newly created state-run agency (the ''Agência de Acreditação e Avaliação do Ensino Superior''). During the XVII ''Governo Constitucional'', the pan-European [[Bologna Process]] was fully implemented in Portugal.

On the other hand, the government created a policy of certification and equivalence of qualifications for adult people with low levels of formal education who want a 4th, 6th, 9th or 12th grade equivalence without returning to school (for example, through this process, called ''Novas Oportunidades'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novasoportunidades.gov.pt/ |title=Guia de Acesso ao Secundário |publisher=Novasoportunidades.gov.pt |accessdate=24 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203080944/http://www.novasoportunidades.gov.pt/ |archive-date= 3 February 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portugal.gov.pt/Portal/PT/Governos/Governos_Constitucionais/GC17/Ministerios/MTSS/Comunicacao/Programas_e_Dossiers/20050921_MTSS_Prog_Novas_Oportunidades.htm |title=Portal do Governo |publisher=Portugal.gov.pt |accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref> adults—18 years old and older—with the 9th grade might be granted an equivalence to the 12th grade after a process ranging from a part-time 3-month programme or a 1-day-per-week 8-month programme; those who have less than 9th grade have a similar programme to get the 9th grade certification and can then apply to the 12th grade programme). The curricula do not include any classical high school discipline or a traditional examination process. These diplomas are awarded based on vaguely construed life experience.

According to the [[OECD]]'s [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), the average Portuguese 15-year-old student was for many years underrated and underachieving in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge in the OECD, nearly tied with the Italian and just above those from countries like Greece, Turkey and Mexico. However, since 2010, PISA results for Portuguese students improved dramatically. The PISA 2009 report states that the average Portuguese 15-year-old student, when rated in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge, is placed at the same level as those students from the United States, Sweden, Germany, Ireland, France, Denmark, United Kingdom, Hungary and [[Taipei]], with 489 points (493 is the average).<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.destak.pt/artigo/82223-alunos-portugueses-pela-primeira-vez-perto-da-media-relatorio-pisa Alunos portugueses pela primeira vez "perto da média" – relatório PISA], [[Destak]]</ref> However, a couple of weeks later, the Portuguese Ministry of Education announced a 2010 report published by its office for educational evaluation GAVE (Gabinete de Avaliação do Ministério da Educação) which criticized the results of PISA 2009 report and claimed that the average Portuguese teenage student had profound handicaps in terms of expression, communication and logic, as well as a low performance when asked to solve problems.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://tv2.rtp.pt/noticias/?t=Ministerio-aponta-graves-problemas-aos-alunos-portugueses.rtp&article=403245&visual=3&layout=10&tm=9 Estudo do ministério aponta graves problemas aos alunos portugueses] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510023610/http://tv2.rtp.pt/noticias/?t=Ministerio-aponta-graves-problemas-aos-alunos-portugueses.rtp&article=403245&visual=3&layout=10&tm=9 |date=10 May 2011 }}, GAVE (Gabinete de Avaliação do Ministério da Educação) 2010 report in [[Radio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]]</ref>

=====Transportation developments=====
[[File:20100327-InauguracaoRamalPortoAveiro.JPG|thumb|Sócrates speaking in the ceremonial opening of a [[:pt:Ramal do Porto de Aveiro|new railway line]], on 27 March 2010.]]

Prime Minister José Sócrates and his government team supported the decision of building new transportation infrastructure such as a new airport for Lisbon and a [[High-speed rail in Portugal|high speed rail network]]. For months the government of Prime Minister José Sócrates insisted the country's only option for a new airport was in the [[Ota (Alenquer)|Ota]] region north of Lisbon. But a powerful lobby, headed by local business honchos and given the imprimatur of the Portuguese president [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]], forced Sócrates's Government into reversal, by bringing an alternative site for the new airport – the [[Portuguese Air Force]]'s [[Field Firing Range of Alcochete|shooting range in Alcochete]] east of Lisbon. A study commissioned by a group of businesspeople said the [[Alcochete]] site would save taxpayers as much as €3bn in construction costs, and would have less of an environmental impact. The government argued that Ota was a key piece of its overall transport strategy, which included highspeed rail lines to Spain, but even so recognized that the project wasn't finalized and that a debate on the pros and cons of both sites would be worthwhile. Then the government commissioned a technical study to the state-run civil engineering laboratory ({{lang-pt|[[Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil]]}}) comparing both locations one to each other. Following the conclusions of that study, on 10 January 2008 the Prime Minister José Sócrates announced the option Alcochete as the most rational choice for a new airport for Lisbon.

=====Other=====
In 2007, the XVII ''Governo Constitucional'', headed by Prime Minister José Sócrates, legalised abortion in Portugal after a referendum. Voters were being asked to decide whether to make abortion legal in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, if carried out at the woman's request in a registered clinic. Despite the turnout for a referendum being too low (40%; 50% needed) to be legally binding, José Sócrates said: "Our interest is to fight clandestine abortion and we have to produce a law that respects the result of the referendum."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6350651.stm Portugal will legalise abortion], [[BBC News]] (12 February 2007)</ref> This socialist government cabinet also announced its intention to legalize [[same-sex marriage]] at some point during its mandate. [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal]] was legalized on 17 May 2010.

Also, in 2009, through the [http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2009/04/07000/0219402206.pdf Decree-Law 91/2009], the rights of fathers and mothers were equalled under the law (see also [[Fathers' rights]]).

After a sharp increase of the [[violent crime]] [[Crime in Portugal|rate in Portugal]] during the XVII ''Governo Constitucional'' government (2005–2009), the Minister of Internal Administration [[Rui Pereira (politician)|Rui Pereira]] announced in February 2009 the expansion of the police force through the recruitment of 2,000 new police officers, 7,000 new state-of-the-art police weapons, 1,000 [[bulletproof vest]]s, among other measures.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} Filipe Caetano, [http://diario.iol.pt/sociedade/rui-pereira-seguranca-psp-gnr-administracao-interna/1041698-4071.html Ministro quer mais polícias, mas não explica crime], IOL.pt (10 February 2009)</ref>

Until 2010, for [[stock]] held for more than twelve months the [[Capital gain tax|capital gain]] was exempt. The capital gain of stock held for shorter periods of time was taxable on 10%. From 2010 onwards, for residents, all capital gain of stock and other assets above €500 is taxable on 20%.

José Sócrates, as Prime Minister of Portugal, presided over the rotative [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] for the period July–December 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu2007.pt/UE/vEN/ |title=EU Presidency |publisher=Eu2007.pt |accessdate=26 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411175943/http://www.eu2007.pt/UE/ven/ |archive-date=11 April 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In this post, Sócrates and his team focused on the EU-[[Brazil]] ([[1st EU-Brazil summit]]) and EU-[[African Union]] ([[2007 Africa-EU Summit]]) relations, as well as in the approval of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]. The [[Portuguese Parliament]] voted to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon on 23 April 2008. After the Irish referendum on 12 June 2008, Prime Minister José Sócrates said he saw the Irish "No" to the treaty as a "personal defeat" after it was signed by EU leaders in the Portuguese capital.<ref>[http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1213380168.95 Europe stunned by Irish rejection of treaty]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> A second referendum was held in Ireland in 2009, and the outcome was the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon by all EU member states, including Ireland.

====Economic crisis====
{{main|Economic history of Portugal}}
From 2005 to 2010, José Sócrates' cabinet faced increasing challenges due to [[Economic history of Portugal#Economic crisis: the 2010s|economic and financial downturn]]. Portuguese economy was in crisis since 2002 owing to stagnation and high unemployment; in the late 2000s, Europe's [[sovereign debt crisis]] led to huge [[Government budget deficit|deficits]] and even higher rampant unemployment in Portugal. International [[financial market]]s compelled the Portuguese Government, like other European governments, to make radical changes in economic policy. Thus in September 2010, the Portuguese Government announced a fresh austerity package following other [[Eurozone]] partners, aiming to halve its budget deficit by 2011 with a series of tax hikes and salary cuts for [[public servant]]s. In 2009, the deficit had been 9.4%, one of the highest in the Eurozone and way above the [[European Union]]'s [[Stability and Growth Pact]] 3% limit. The Portuguese Government earlier targeted a 2011 shortfall of 5.1% but a growing crisis sparked by chronic budget expenditure, massive debt and deficit problems, forced Portugal to take even more difficult measures. In September, pressure from the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Ecofin]], [[OECD]] and the main opposition party, forced Sócrates' cabinet to adopt successive packages of radical austerity measures, contrary to what had been promised during the previous [[electoral campaign]]s.
A report published in January 2011 by the ''[[Diário de Notícias]]'', a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated that in the period between the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974 and 2010, the democratic [[Government of Portugal|Portuguese Republic government]]s have encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This has funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable [[slippage (finance)|slippage]] in state-managed [[public works]], inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky [[credit (finance)|credit]], [[public debt]] creation and mismanaged European [[structural and cohesion funds]] for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister Sócrates's cabinet was not able to forecast or prevent any of this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable of doing anything to ameliorate the situation when the country was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2011.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110108021723/http://dn.sapo.pt/inicio/tv/interior.aspx?content_id=1750097&seccao=Media Grande investigação DN Conheça o verdadeiro peso do Estado], ''[[Diário de Notícias]]'' (7 January 2011)</ref>

On 6 April 2011, having already resigned as Prime Minister, Sócrates went on television to announce that Portugal, facing bankruptcy, would request financial assistance from the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] (at the time managed by [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]]) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]], as [[Greece]] and the Republic of Ireland had already done. The announcement was made 48 hours after Sócrates had categorically denied the move would be needed.

====Fall of government====
On 23 March 2011, Sócrates resigned following passage of a [[no confidence]] motion sponsored by all five opposition parties in parliament over spending cuts and tax increases.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110323-portuguese-parliament-votes-against-austerity-plan-jose-socrates-eurozone |title=Portuguese parliament votes against austerity plan |date=23 March 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |publisher=[[France 24]]}}</ref> Before the vote, Sócrates had stated that he would resign if the vote for further austerity measures didn't pass.<ref name="Guardian-resign">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/23/portugal-government-collapses-eu-bailout-looms |title=Portugal in crisis after prime minister resigns over austerity measures |website=The Guardian |location=UK |date=23 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref> As a result, a [[2011 Portuguese general election|general election]] was held on 5 June 2011.<ref name="Guardian-resign" />

The Portuguese government fell a day before an EU summit was due to take place to finalise the EU's response to countries requiring a bailout in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/24/summit-begins-portugal-crisis |title=EU summit begins in the shadow of Portugal's crisis |website=The Guardian |location=UK |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref>

After losing the [[2011 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 2011]], held on 5 June 2011, he resigned from Secretary-General of the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]].

==Controversies==

===Sócrates–Independente affair===
In March 2007, ''[[Universidade Independente]]'' (UnI), a private university in Lisbon, was placed under investigation for alleged irregularities on several matters.

In that same month, Sócrates' ''licenciatura'' degree in civil engineering by ''Universidade Independente'' was put under enormous public scrutiny.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Journalists found that qualifications awarded did not follow procedure and that four of the five [[academic discipline]]s were given in the private university by the same professor, António José Moraes, a socialist government appointee. A fifth academic discipline, "technical English" was given by the Independente's [[Rector (academia)|rector]]. A strong case was built up related to possible false declarations by José Sócrates regarding his university degree, and the way he was awarded this degree in civil engineering. Among other issues, the Independente degree in civil engineering was not an accredited degree, a civil engineering department was not yet established at that university, one examination was sent by [[fax]] and Sócrates' diploma was issued on a Sunday, a day on which the university was always closed.

Some Portuguese news media professionals stated that Sócrates or members of his staff, through phone calls, threatened court action against journalists and tried to stop the reportings on his ''licenciatura'' degree awarded by UnI.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://ultimahora.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1291018&idCanal=1453 Sofia Branco – José Manuel Fernandes e Sarsfield Cabral disseram ter havido ameaças de processos judiciais] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612074717/http://ultimahora.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1291018&idCanal=1453 |date=12 June 2007 }}, in [[Público (Portugal)|Público]]</ref> On 9 April 2007, ''Universidade Independente'' was closed by government officials after an investigation reported several serious irregularities in the running of this private university.

Under heavy pressure, Sócrates provided his version of the facts on Wednesday 11 April 2007 in a live broadcast interview for the [[RTP 1]] TV channel and [[Radiodifusão Portuguesa|RDP]] radio. The Prime Minister stated he was not favoured by the ''Universidade Independente'' to obtain the degree, declared he had been the target of "catty accusations", and defended the authenticity of the degree, though admitting he is not a fully chartered civil engineer.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://noticias.rtp.pt/index.php?article=277869&visual=16 José Sócrates espera que entrevista à RTP e RDP tenha sido esclarecedora], in [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal]]</ref> In his official biography at the [[Portuguese Government]]'s official website Sócrates claimed to have already obtained the qualification of engineer. He later admitted that this was a "lapse", and the government website altered his CV, downgrading "civil engineer" to "diploma in civil engineering". In the interest of accuracy, he should have used "''licenciado em engenharia civil''" instead of "''engenheiro''". Before he had been granted the degree, he presented himself as an "engineer" when he was solely a "[[technical engineer]]". [[Portuguese Parliament]] documents with official information on Sócrates personal data were found, proving such inconsistencies.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.rtp.pt/index.php?article=278954&visual=16&rss=0 PSD comunicou a Gama que registos de Sócrates eram assunto encerrado] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112095112/http://www.rtp.pt/index.php?article=278954&visual=16&rss=0 |date=12 November 2007 }}, in [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal]]</ref> Sócrates and his staff replied to this by stating that it was probably a misunderstanding in the parliamentary services. After having the ''licenciatura'' diploma he used the title "engineer" in several official documents, despite the fact that his unaccredited degree in civil engineering from ''Universidade Independente'' was not legally recognized to allow for the use of the title "engineer"; a profession which is regulated in Portugal by the ''[[Ordem dos Engenheiros]]''.

José Sócrates was fiercely criticised by members of Portugal's democratic opposition in the Parliament regarding both proved and unproven issues related with this controversy. Nicolau Santos, a television journalist and a director of [[Expresso (Portuguese newspaper)|Expresso]] newspaper, criticised the controversial series of fait-divers published in [[Público (Portugal)|Público]] and claimed that despite the extensive coverage of details, Público's investigation lead to "no definitive conclusion" and might be connected with other issues. In the same tone, several other media personalities, like [[SIC Notícias]]' journalist [[Ricardo Costa (journalist)|Ricardo Costa]], also suggested controversially that [[SONAE]] corporation, the parent company of Público newspaper, was behind the beginning of the controversy due to a failed [[takeover bid]] of SONAE's telecommunications operator over the largest Portuguese telecom – [[Portugal Telecom]].<ref>[http://www.clubedejornalistas.pt/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=933 Clube de Jornalistas > 1.ª Página > Quando o telefone toca]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> The complexity of the takeover bid involving the largest Portuguese telecom, prompted State intervention by the ''[[Autoridade da Concorrência]]'' (The Portuguese Competition Authority).

It was found that a close friend of Sócrates, [[Armando Vara]], was also awarded a diploma by the ''Universidade Independente'' days before he was appointed to a high ranking banking administration position in the state-run [[Caixa Geral de Depósitos]], which in turn was strictly opened to candidates holding at last one academic degree in any subject.

====Investigation====
State authorities investigated the affair and archived the file on the grounds that the suspicions of falsification and irregularities allegedly attributed to José Sócrates turned out to be formally impossible to prove.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} On the other hand, the ''Universidade Independente'' was investigated by education state authorities, which resulted in the compulsory closing of that private university in October 2007, due to lack of academic rigour and teaching quality, along with generalized managerial and financial chaos in the institution.<ref>{{Cite news|agency=[[Lusa News Agency|Lusa]] |date=27 October 2007 |title=Universidade Independente já transferiu todos os alunos e encerra na quarta-feira |language=pt |newspaper=Público |url=https://www.publico.pt/2007/10/26/portugal/noticia/universidade-independente-ja-transferiu-todos-os-alunos-e-encerra-na-quartafeira-1308882 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012193702/https://www.publico.pt/2007/10/26/portugal/noticia/universidade-independente-ja-transferiu-todos-os-alunos-e-encerra-na-quartafeira-1308882 |archive-date=12 October 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>

A [[low-cost]] [[Intel]] [[Classmate PC]]-based [[netbook]] for use by children, announced and sponsored by Sócrates' cabinet, named ''Magalhães'' (after [[Fernão de Magalhães]]), assembled by the Portuguese company J.P.

===Freeport outlet controversy===
Since 2005, and, especially again in 2009, it was suggested by some Portuguese and British media that José Sócrates allegedly waived environmental restrictions, following intervention by one of his uncles and a cousin, to grant the British company Freeport a licence to build the Alcochete mall, a gigantic emporium near the [[Tagus]] river, developed in part on protected land outside Lisbon in 2002, when he was Minister for Environment of the PM [[António Guterres]] cabinet.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/portugal-pm-vows-to-defend-honour-over-mall-1517567.html |newspaper=The Independent |title=Portugal PM vows to defend honour over mall |date=27 January 2009 |first=Elizabeth |last=Nash }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g2Dke6tMiLmvWYjhQun12f4EYENA |title=AFP: Portuguese PM denies taking bribes from British firm |date=24 January 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}</ref>
Portuguese authorities have meanwhile insisted José Sócrates was not under investigation, nor was he a suspect, while UK's [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] refused to confirm the veracity of reports emanating in Portugal. José Sócrates also stated the Freeport project was in due compliance with all legal requirements at the time.<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20110524220732/http://www.the-news.net/cgi-bin/article.pl?id=995-1 PM under UK investigation?] The Portugal News Online (31 January 2009)</ref> Júlio Eduardo Coelho Monteiro, a businessman who is an uncle of José Sócrates, told the Portuguese newspaper Sol how he established contact between his nephew and Freeport's representatives.

In a DVD held by the British police and released in March 2009 by the Portuguese media, Charles Smith, a consultant hired to handle the licensing of the Freeport of Alcochete, clearly stated that José Sócrates "was corrupt" and that he received, through a cousin, money to give the green light to the project for the "outlet". The recording revealed by [[Televisão Independente|TVI]] is only part of a conversation of 20 minutes that alongside Charles Smith also included John Cabral, an official of the consultant, and Alan Perkins, director of Freeport. It was the latter who, without knowledge of the other two, has recorded the event, where Smith and Cabral were questioned about the money that left the company to be used for the payment of "gloves" to the current Prime Minister. Charles Smith is one of two defendants in the case Freeport, commercial space on the process of Freeport Alcochete, related to alleged suspicions of corruption in the amendment to the Special Protection Area of the Tagus estuary (ZPET) decided three days before the elections of 2002, through a decree-law, when José Sócrates was Minister of Environment.

The conversation now revealed took place in 2006 with the aim of explaining the large outgoing amounts of money from the company's headquarters in London at the time of approval of the project. According to some sources contacted in London by TVI, José Sócrates remains the main suspect of British police. The British police are now set to send to the Portuguese authorities the 25 volumes of all research done in this process in England. The Serious Fraud Office, which investigates major financial fraud in Britain, has seen its activity limited due to the lack cooperation of the Portuguese authorities in investigating the case. The first official meeting took place only on 17 November 2008 in The Hague, the headquarters of Eurojust, a body which is designed to facilitate judicial cooperation in the EU. The judge Cândida Almeida, director of DCIAP (Central Department for investigation and prosecution), which coordinates the department's prosecutor who investigates the case, refused a joint research proposal by the English. Then have taken note of the DVD. The prosecutor dropped the evidence, arguing that it was not in Portuguese law.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://ultimahora.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1371282&idCanal=62 Freeport: Smith afirma em DVD na posse da polícia inglesa que Sócrates “é corrupto”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330043841/http://ultimahora.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1371282&idCanal=62 |date=30 March 2009 }}, [[Público (Portugal)|Público]] (27 March 2009)</ref>

The [[Eurojust]] tried to distance itself from the scandal involving its head, José da Mota, a Portuguese, who allegedly put pressure on prosecutors in order to stop a corruption probe involving Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates. Two magistrates dealing with the so-called Freeport affair accused José Mota of having tried to persuade them to side-line the investigation at the request of the Portuguese premier and the minister of justice. The premier and Mr Mota's relationship goes back to the late nineties, when they worked in the same government as state secretaries for environment and justice respectively. In 2002, when the new EU body was formed (Eurojust), Mr Mota was transferred to [[The Hague]] as Portugal's representative to Eurojust. He was elected head of the judicial co-operation body in 2007, at a time when the so-called Freeport case had already started in Portugal.<ref>[http://euobserver.com/9/28120 Eurojust chief embroiled in Portuguese corruption scandal], euobserver.com (13 May 2009)</ref>

On 22 May 2012, Alan Perkins, a Freeport manager between 2005 and 2006, said, under oath in court, that illegal payments had been made to the minister of the Environment. At the time, the minister of the Environment was José Sócrates.

===Face Oculta scandal===
{{main|Face Oculta}}
Another corruption case involving Sócrates was the [[Face Oculta]] scandal. On 28 October 2009 the police began investigating a business group headquartered in [[Ovar]]. [[Armando Vara]], one of the suspects, was reported to have had "talks" with Sócrates. Sócrates denied any involvement, claiming that he was only talking to a friend.<ref>{{Cite news|date=11 November 2009 |title=Face Oculta: BE quer ouvir ministro da Economia no Parlamento |language=pt |newspaper=Jornal I |url=http://www.ionline.pt/conteudo/32449-face-oculta-be-quer-ouvir-ministro-da-economia-no-parlamento |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722002354/http://www.ionline.pt/conteudo/32449-face-oculta-be-quer-ouvir-ministro-da-economia-no-parlamento |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy}}</ref>
