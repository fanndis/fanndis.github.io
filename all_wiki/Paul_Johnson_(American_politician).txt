== Biography ==
Johnson was elected to the Phoenix [[city council]] in 1985 at the age of 25.  During his second term in 1990, Johnson was selected by the council to fill the vacancy left by outgoing mayor [[Terry Goddard]], who had resigned in order to run for [[governor]].  Johnson was elected mayor in his own right in 1993.  Running unopposed, he garnered 99.7% of the vote.

After serving one year and three months of his own term as mayor, Johnson announced his resignation to run for governor just as his predecessor had done.  Johnson ran against Goddard who was making his second bid in 1994, but they both lost to another primary candidate, popular [[supermarket]] owner [[Eddie Basha]].  Johnson again sought the governorship in [[Arizona gubernatorial election, 1998|1998]], running unopposed in the primary but losing to Republican incumbent [[Jane Dee Hull]] by a 25% margin in the general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azsos.gov/results/1998general/GEN2000.htm|title=1998 General Election (unofficial results)|publisher=Arizona Secretary of State|date=1998-11-23|accessdate=2008-08-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101123251/http://www.azsos.gov/results/1998general/GEN2000.htm|archivedate=2011-11-01}}</ref>
