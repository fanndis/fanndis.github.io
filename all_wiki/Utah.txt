'''Utah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|t|ɑː}} {{respell|YOO|tah}}, {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Utah.ogg|ˈ|juː|t|ɔː}} {{respell|YOO|taw}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Western United States|Western]] [[United States]]. It is bordered by [[Colorado]] to the east, [[Wyoming]] to the northeast, [[Idaho]] to the north, [[Arizona]] to the south and [[Nevada]] to the west. It also touches [[Four Corners|a corner]] of [[New Mexico]] in the southeast. Of the [[List of states and territories of the United States|fifty U.S. states]], Utah is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|13th-largest by area]]; with a population over three million, it is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|30th-most-populous]] and [[List of U.S. states by population density|11th-least-densely populated]]. Urban development is mostly concentrated in two areas: the [[Wasatch Front]] in the north-central part of the state, which is home to roughly two-thirds of the population and includes the capital city, [[Salt Lake City]]; and [[Washington County, Utah|Washington County]] in the south, with more than 170,000 residents.<ref>{{citation |url= http://governor.utah.gov/dea/QGET/DataBook/4.htm |contribution= Introduction: Urban Growth in Utah |title= QGET Databook |year= 1997 |publisher= Quality Growth Efficiency Tools (QGET) Technical Committee, Governor's Office of Management & Budget, State of Utah |access-date= November 4, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104164218/http://governor.utah.gov/DEA/QGET/DataBook/4.htm |archive-date= November 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |df= mdy-all }}; see also: {{citation |url= http://governor.utah.gov/DEA/QGET/DataBook/Figures/db3.html |contribution= Figures: Population Growth, 1940–2020 (slide 3) |title= QGET Databook |year= 1997 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104164243/http://governor.utah.gov/DEA/QGET/DataBook/Figures/db3.html |archive-date= November 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date= November 4, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Most of the western half of Utah lies in the [[Great Basin]].

The territory of modern Utah has been inhabited by various [[Indigenous people of the United States|indigenous groups]] for thousands of years, including the [[Ancestral Puebloans|ancient Puebloans]], the Navajo and the Ute. The Spanish were the first Europeans to arrive in the mid-16th century, though the region's difficult geography and climate made it a peripheral part of [[New Spain]] and later Mexico. Even while it was part of Mexico, many of Utah's earliest settlers were American, particularly Mormons fleeing marginalization and persecution from the United States. Following the [[Mexican–American War]], it became part of the [[Utah Territory]], which included what is now Colorado and Nevada. Disputes between the dominant Mormon community and the federal government delayed Utah's admission as a state; only after the outlawing of polygamy was it admitted as the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|45th]], in 1896.

A little more than half of all Utahns are [[Mormons]], the vast majority of whom are members of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), which has its world headquarters in Salt Lake City.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/state/utah/ |title= Adults in Utah - Religion in America |website = Pew Research Center |access-date = June 28, 2020}}</ref> Utah is the only state where most of the population belongs to a single church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/surveys/aris-2001/|title=American Religious Identification Survey (2001)|publisher=[[Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture|ISSSC]]|access-date=October 31, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103201759/http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/surveys/aris-2001/|archive-date=November 3, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The LDS Church greatly influences Utahn culture, politics, and daily life,<ref name="Canham 2012-04-17">{{cite news |last= Canham |first= Matt |date= April 17, 2012 |title= Census: Share of Utah's Mormon residents holds steady |url= http://www.sltrib.com/53909710-200/population-lds-county-utah.html |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104170941/http://www.sltrib.com/53909710-200/population-lds-county-utah.html |archive-date= November 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref> though since the 1990s the state has become more religiously diverse as well as secular.

==History==

{{Main|History of Utah}}

===Pre-Columbian===

[[File:California1838.jpg|thumb|Map showing Utah in 1838 when it was part of Mexico, Britannica 7th edition]]

Thousands of years before the arrival of European explorers, the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] and the [[Fremont culture|Fremont]] people lived in what is now known as Utah, some of which spoke languages of the [[Uto-Aztecan]] group. Ancestral Pueblo peoples built their homes through excavations in mountains, and the Fremont people built houses of straw before disappearing from the region around the 15th century.

Another group of Native Americans, the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], settled in the region around the 18th century. In the mid-18th century, other Uto-Aztecan tribes, including the [[Goshute]], the [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]], the [[Shoshone]], and the [[Ute people]], also settled in the region. These five groups were present when the first European explorers arrived.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/american_indians/nativeamericansinutah.html|title=Native Americans in Utah|website=historytogo.utah.gov|access-date=July 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625180359/http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/american_indians/nativeamericansinutah.html|archive-date=June 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ilovehistory.utah.gov/people/first_peoples/tribes/|title=Utah's American Indians|website=ilovehistory.utah.gov|language=en|access-date=July 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625190631/http://ilovehistory.utah.gov/people/first_peoples/tribes/|archive-date=June 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Spanish exploration (1540)===

{{Main|New Spain|The Californias#History|First Mexican Empire|Provisional Government of Mexico|First Mexican Republic|Centralist Republic of Mexico}}

The southern Utah region was explored by the Spanish in 1540, led by [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]], while looking for the legendary [[Seven Cities of Gold|Cíbola]]. A group led by two Catholic priests—sometimes called the [[Domínguez–Escalante expedition]]—left [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] in 1776, hoping to find a route to the coast of California. The expedition traveled as far north as [[Utah Lake]] and encountered the native residents. The Spanish made further explorations in the region but were not interested in colonizing the area because of its desert nature. In 1821, the year Mexico achieved its independence from Spain, the region became known as part of its territory of [[Alta California]].

European trappers and [[fur traders]] explored some areas of Utah in the early 19th century from Canada and the United States. The city of [[Provo, Utah]] was named for one, [[Étienne Provost]], who visited the area in 1825. The city of [[Ogden, Utah]] was named after [[Peter Skene Ogden]], a Canadian explorer who traded furs in the Weber Valley.

In late 1824, [[Jim Bridger]] became the first known English-speaking person to sight the [[Great Salt Lake]]. Due to the high salinity of its waters, He thought he had found the Pacific Ocean; he subsequently learned this body of water was a giant [[salt lake]]. After the discovery of the lake, hundreds of American and Canadian traders and trappers established trading posts in the region. In the 1830s, thousands of migrants traveling from the Eastern United States to the American West began to make stops in the region of the Great Salt Lake, then known as Lake Youta.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

[[File:BrighamYoung1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brigham Young]] led the first [[Mormon pioneers]] to the Great Salt Lake.]]

Following the [[death of Joseph Smith]] in 1844, [[Brigham Young]], as president of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]], became the effective leader of the LDS Church in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]].<ref>[[Leonard J. Arrington]] and [[Davis Bitton]]: ''The Mormon Experience'', page 22. Vintage/Random House, 1979.</ref> To address the growing conflicts between his people and their neighbors, Young agreed with Illinois Governor [[Thomas Ford (politician)|Thomas Ford]] in October 1845 that the Mormons would leave by the following year.<ref>Richard N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling: ''Mormon America'', page 38–39. Harper Collins, 2000.</ref>

Young and the first band of Mormon pioneers reached the [[Salt Lake Valley]] on July 24, 1847. Over the next 22 years, more than 70,000 pioneers crossed the plains and settled in Utah.<ref>William W. Slaughter and Michael Landon: ''Trail of Hope—The Story of the Mormon Trail''. [[Shadow Mountain]], 1997.</ref> For the first few years, Brigham Young and the thousands of early settlers of Salt Lake City struggled to survive. The arid desert land was deemed by the Mormons as desirable as a place where they could practice their religion without harassment.

Settlers buried thirty-six Native Americans in one grave after an outbreak of measles occurred during the winter of 1847.<ref name=Arave>{{cite news |last1=Arave |first1=Lynn |title=Tidbits of history — Unusual highlights of Salt Lake County |url=https://www.deseret.com/2007/1/5/19993469/tidbits-of-history-151-unusual-highlights-of-salt-lake-county#part-of-downtown-salt-lake-city-will-soon-be-redeveloped-by-the-lds-church-for-decades-the-salt-lake-temple-stood-out-as-the-areas-most-prominent-structure |access-date=May 6, 2020 |work=Deseret News |date=January 5, 2007}}</ref>

Utah was Mexican territory when the first pioneers arrived in 1847. Early in the [[Mexican–American War]] in late 1846, the United States had taken control of [[Capture of Santa Fe|New Mexico]] and California. The entire Southwest [[Mexican Cession|became U.S. territory]] upon the signing of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], February 2, 1848. The treaty was ratified by the [[United States Senate]] on March 11. Learning that California and New Mexico were applying for statehood, the settlers of the Utah area (originally having planned to petition for territorial status) applied for statehood with an ambitious plan for a [[State of Deseret]].

The Mormon settlements provided pioneers for other settlements in the West. Salt Lake City became the hub of a "far-flung commonwealth"<ref>Arrington and Bitton, p. 118</ref> of Mormon settlements. With new church converts coming from the East and around the world, Church leaders often assigned groups of church members as missionaries to establish other settlements throughout the West. They developed irrigation to support fairly large pioneer populations along Utah's Wasatch front (Salt Lake City, Bountiful and Weber Valley, and Provo and Utah Valley).<ref>[[William Clayton (Mormon)|William Clayton]], edited by George D. Smith: ''An Intimate Chronicle: The Journals of William Clayton'', p. 300. [[Signature Books]], 1991.</ref> Throughout the remainder of the 19th century, Mormon pioneers established hundreds of other settlements in Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming, California, Canada, and Mexico—including in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]; [[Franklin, Idaho]] (the first European settlement in Idaho); [[San Bernardino, California]]; [[Mesa, Arizona]]; [[Star Valley|Star Valley, Wyoming]]; and [[Carson Valley, Nevada]].

Prominent settlements in Utah included [[Saint George, Utah|St. George]], [[Logan, Utah|Logan]], and [[Manti, Utah|Manti]] (where settlers completed the first three [[Temples (Mormonism)|temples]] in Utah, each started after but finished many years before the larger and better known temple built in Salt Lake City was completed in 1893), as well as Parowan, Cedar City, Bluff, Moab, Vernal, Fillmore (which served as the territorial capital between 1850 and 1856), Nephi, Levan, Spanish Fork, Springville, Provo Bench (now Orem), Pleasant Grove, American Fork, Lehi, Sandy, Murray, Jordan, Centerville, Farmington, Huntsville, Kaysville, Grantsville, Tooele, Roy, Brigham City, and many other smaller towns and settlements. Young had an expansionist's view of the territory that he and the Mormon pioneers were settling, calling it Deseret—which according to the [[Book of Mormon]] was an ancient word for "honeybee". This is symbolized by the beehive on the Utah flag, and the state's motto, "Industry".<ref>Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: "Church History in the Fullness of Times". 1989.</ref>

The [[Utah Territory]] was much smaller than the proposed state of Deseret, but it still contained all of the present states of Nevada and Utah as well as pieces of modern Wyoming and Colorado.<ref>Michael S. Durham: ''Desert between the Mountains'', pages 162,163. University of Oklahoma Press, 1997.</ref> It was created with the [[Compromise of 1850]], and [[Fillmore, Utah|Fillmore]], named after President [[Millard Fillmore]], was designated the capital. The territory was given the name Utah after the Ute tribe of Native Americans. Salt Lake City replaced Fillmore as the territorial capital in 1856.

By 1850, there were around 100 black people in the territory, the majority of whom were slaves.<ref name=smith>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idktzKdgb7YC|title=Dictionary of Afro-American Slavery|author=John David Smith|isbn=9780275957995|year=1997}}</ref> In Salt Lake County, 26 slaves were counted.<ref name="Arave"/> In 1852, the territorial legislature passed the [[Act in Relation to Service]] and the [[Act for the relief of Indian Slaves and Prisoners]] formally legalizing slavery in the territory. Slavery was abolished in the territory during the Civil War.

In 1850, Salt Lake City sent out a force known as the [[Nauvoo Legion]] and engaged the [[Timpanogos]] in the [[Battle at Fort Utah]].<ref name="Farmer"/>{{rp|71}}

Disputes between the [[Mormon]] inhabitants and the [[Government of the United States|U.S. government]] intensified due to the practice of [[plural marriage]], or [[polygamy]], among members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Mormons were still pushing for the establishment of a State of Deseret with the new borders of the Utah Territory. Most, if not all, of the members of the U.S. government opposed the polygamous practices of the Mormons.

Members of the LDS Church were viewed as un-American and rebellious when news of their polygamous practices spread. In 1857, particularly heinous accusations of abdication of government and general immorality were leveled by former associate justice William W. Drummond, among others. The detailed reports of life in Utah caused the administration of [[James Buchanan]] to send a secret military "expedition" to Utah. When the supposed rebellion should be quelled, [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]] would take the place of Brigham Young as territorial governor. The resulting conflict is known as the [[Utah War]], nicknamed "Buchanan's Blunder" by the Mormon leaders.

In September 1857, about 120 American settlers of the Baker–Fancher wagon train, en route to California from Arkansas, were murdered by [[Nauvoo Legion#In Utah|Utah Territorial Militia]] and some [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]] Native Americans in the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Ravitz |first= Jessica |url= http://www.sltrib.com/ci_6862682 |title= LDS Church Apologizes for Mountain Meadows Massacre |newspaper= The Salt Lake Tribune |date= September 11, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104171210/http://www.sltrib.com/ci_6862682 |archive-date= November 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Before troops led by [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] entered the territory, Brigham Young ordered all residents of Salt Lake City to evacuate southward to [[Utah Valley]] and sent out the Nauvoo Legion to delay the government's advance. Although wagons and supplies were burned, eventually the troops arrived in 1858, and Young surrendered official control to Cumming, although most subsequent commentators claim that Young retained true power in the territory. A steady stream of governors appointed by the president quit the position, often citing the traditions of their supposed territorial government. By agreement with Young, Johnston established [[Camp Floyd]], {{convert|40|mi|km|-1}} away from Salt Lake City, to the southwest.

Salt Lake City was the last link of the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph]], completed in October 1861. Brigham Young was among the first to send a message, along with [[Abraham Lincoln]] and other officials.

Because of the [[American Civil War]], federal troops were pulled out of Utah Territory in 1861. This was a boon to the local economy as the army sold everything in camp for pennies on the dollar before marching back east to join the war. The territory was then left in LDS hands until [[Patrick Edward Connor|Patrick E. Connor]] arrived with a regiment of California volunteers in 1862. Connor established [[Fort Douglas (Utah)|Fort Douglas]] just {{convert|3|mi|km}} east of Salt Lake City and encouraged his people to discover mineral deposits to bring more non-Mormons into the territory. Minerals were discovered in [[Tooele County, Utah|Tooele County]] and miners began to flock to the territory.

Beginning in 1865, [[Utah's Black Hawk War]] developed into the deadliest conflict in the territory's history. Chief [[Antonga Black Hawk]] died in 1870, but fights continued to break out until additional federal troops were sent in to suppress the [[Ghost Dance]] of 1872. The war is unique among [[Indian Wars]] because it was a three-way conflict, with mounted Timpanogos [[Ute Tribe|Utes]] led by Antonga Black Hawk fighting federal and LDS authorities.

On May 10, 1869, the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was completed at [[Promontory Summit]], north of the [[Great Salt Lake]].<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/ |title = Ceremony at "Wedding of the Rails", May 10, 1869 at Promontory Point, Utah |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = May 10, 1869 |access-date = July 20, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131018052635/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/ |archive-date = October 18, 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref> The railroad brought increasing numbers of people into the territory and several influential businesspeople made fortunes there.

During the 1870s and 1880s laws were passed to punish polygamists due, in part, to stories from Utah. Notably, Ann Eliza Young—tenth wife to divorce Brigham Young, women's advocate, national lecturer and author of ''Wife No.{{nbsp}}19 or My Life of Bondage'' and Mr. and Mrs. Fanny Stenhouse, authors of ''The Rocky Mountain Saints'' (T. B. H. Stenhouse, 1873) and ''Tell It All: My Life in Mormonism'' (Fanny Stenhouse, 1875). Both Ann Eliza and Fanny testify to the happiness of the very early Church members before polygamy. They independently published their books in 1875. These books and the lectures of Ann Eliza Young have been credited with the United States Congress passage of anti-polygamy laws by newspapers throughout the United States as recorded in "The Ann Eliza Young Vindicator", a pamphlet which detailed Ms Young's travels and warm reception throughout her lecture tour.

T. B. H. Stenhouse, former Utah Mormon polygamist, Mormon missionary for thirteen years and a Salt Lake City newspaper owner, finally left Utah and wrote ''The Rocky Mountain Saints''. His book gives a witnessed account of life in Utah, both the good and the bad. He finally left Utah and Mormonism after financial ruin occurred when Brigham Young sent Stenhouse to relocate to Ogden, Utah, according to Stenhouse, to take over his thriving pro-Mormon ''Salt Lake Telegraph'' newspaper. In addition to these testimonies, ''The Confessions of John D. Lee'', written by John D. Lee—alleged "Scape goat" for the [[Mountain Meadow Massacre]]—also came out in 1877. The corroborative testimonies coming out of Utah from Mormons and former Mormons influenced Congress and the people of the United States.

In the [[1890 Manifesto]], the LDS Church banned polygamy. When Utah applied for statehood again, it was accepted. One of the conditions for granting Utah statehood was that a ban on polygamy be written into the state constitution. This was a condition required of other western states that were admitted into the Union later. Statehood was officially granted on January 4, 1896.

===20th century to present===

[[File:Children reading 1940.jpg|thumb|Children reading in Santa Clara, Utah, in 1940]]

Beginning in the early 20th century, with the establishment of such national parks as [[Bryce Canyon National Park]] and [[Zion National Park]], Utah became known for its natural beauty. Southern Utah became a popular filming spot for arid, rugged scenes featured in the popular mid-century western film genre. From such films, most US residents recognize such natural landmarks as [[Delicate Arch]] and "the Mittens" of [[Monument Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainproject.com/v/monument-valley/105964237|title=Rock Climbing Monument Valley in Northern Arizona|website=Mountain Project|access-date=November 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029035231/http://www.mountainproject.com/v/monument-valley/105964237|archive-date=October 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, with the construction of the [[Interstate highway]] system, accessibility to the southern scenic areas was made easier.

Since the establishment of [[Alta Ski Area]] in 1939 and the subsequent [[Development of Skiing in Utah|development of several ski resorts]] in the state's mountains, Utah's skiing has become world-renowned. The dry, powdery snow of the [[Wasatch Range]] is considered some of the best skiing in the world (the state license plate once claimed "the Greatest Snow on Earth").<ref>[http://www.skinet.com/travel/2008-09/ski-magazines-top-30-resorts-2008-09 SKI Magazine's Top 30 Resorts for 2008–09] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210021223/http://www.skinet.com/travel/2008-09/ski-magazines-top-30-resorts-2008-09 |date=February 10, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/ski/2008-10-20-outside-best-ski-resorts_N.htm |title='Outside' magazine ranks the top ski resorts |website=USA Today |date=October 17, 2008 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526174205/http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/ski/2008-10-20-outside-best-ski-resorts_N.htm |archive-date=May 26, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Salt Lake City won the bid for the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games]], and this served as a great boost to the economy. The ski resorts have increased in popularity, and many of the Olympic venues built along the [[Wasatch Front]] continue to be used for sporting events. Preparation for the Olympics spurred the development of the light-rail system in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], known as [[UTA TRAX|TRAX]], and the re-construction of the freeway system around the city.

In 1957, Utah created the Utah State Parks Commission with four parks. Today, [[Utah State Parks]] manages 43 parks and several undeveloped areas totaling over {{convert|95000|acre|km2}} of land and more than {{convert|1000000|acre|km2}} of water. Utah's state parks are scattered throughout Utah, from [[Bear Lake State Park (Utah)|Bear Lake State Park]] at the Utah/Idaho border to [[Edge of the Cedars State Park]] Museum deep in the [[Four Corners]] region and everywhere in between. Utah State Parks is also home to the state's [[off highway vehicle]] office, state boating office and the trails program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stateparks.utah.gov/about/|title=Official Utah State Parks website|publisher=Stateparks.utah.gov|access-date=November 7, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407044150/http://www.stateparks.utah.gov/about|archive-date=April 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

During the late 20th century, the state grew quickly. In the 1970s growth was phenomenal in the suburbs of the Wasatch Front. [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]] was one of the fastest-growing cities in the country at that time. Today, many areas of Utah continue to see boom-time growth. Northern [[Davis County, Utah|Davis]], southern and western [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake]], [[Summit County, Utah|Summit]], eastern [[Tooele County, Utah|Tooele]], [[Utah County, Utah|Utah]], [[Wasatch County, Utah|Wasatch]], and [[Washington County, Utah|Washington]] counties are all growing very quickly. Management of transportation and urbanization are major issues in politics, as development consumes agricultural land and wilderness areas and transportation is a major reason for poor [[air quality in Utah]].

Utah is known for its natural diversity and is home to features ranging from arid deserts with [[sand dune]]s to thriving [[pine tree|pine]] forests in mountain valleys. It is a rugged and geographically diverse state at the convergence of three distinct geological regions: the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Great Basin]], and the [[Colorado Plateau]].

Utah covers an area of {{convert|84899|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is one of the [[Four Corners]] states and is bordered by [[Idaho]] in the north, [[Wyoming]] in the north and east; by [[Colorado]] in the east; at a single point by [[New Mexico]] to the southeast; by [[Arizona]] in the south; and by [[Nevada]] in the west. Only three U.S. states (Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming) have exclusively latitude and longitude lines as boundaries.

One of Utah's defining characteristics is the variety of its [[terrain]]. Running down the middle of the state's northern third is the [[Wasatch Range]], which rises to heights of almost {{convert|12000|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. Utah is home to world-renowned [[ski resort]]s made popular by light, fluffy snow and winter storms that regularly dump up to three feet of it overnight. In the state's northeastern section, running east to west, are the [[Uinta Mountains]], which rise to heights of over {{convert|13,000|ft|m}}. The highest point in the state, [[Kings Peak (Utah)|Kings Peak]], at {{convert|13,528|ft|m}},<ref name="usgs">{{cite web|date=April 29, 2005 |url=http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |title=Elevations and Distances in the United States |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |access-date=November 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102095332/http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html |archive-date=November 2, 2006 }}</ref> lies within the Uinta Mountains.

At the western base of the Wasatch Range is the [[Wasatch Front]], a series of valleys and basins that are home to the most populous parts of the state. It stretches approximately from [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]] at the north end to [[Nephi, Utah|Nephi]] at the south end. Approximately 75 percent of the state's population lives in this corridor, and population growth is rapid.

Western Utah is mostly arid desert with a [[Basin and Range Province|basin and range]] topography. Small mountain ranges and rugged terrain punctuate the landscape. The [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] are an exception, being comparatively flat as a result of once forming the bed of ancient [[Lake Bonneville]]. [[Great Salt Lake]], [[Utah Lake]], [[Sevier Lake]], and [[Rush Lake (Tooele County, Utah)|Rush Lake]] are all remnants of this ancient freshwater lake,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Salt Lake|last=Morgan|first=Dale L.|publisher=[[University of Utah Press]]|location=Salt Lake City|year=1947|page=22|isbn=978-0-87480-478-2}}</ref> which once covered most of the eastern [[Great Basin]]. West of the [[Great Salt Lake]], stretching to the Nevada border, lies the arid [[Great Salt Lake Desert]]. One exception to this aridity is [[Snake Valley (Great Basin)|Snake Valley]], which is (relatively) lush due to large springs and wetlands fed from [[groundwater]] derived from snow melt in the [[Snake Range]], [[Deep Creek Range]], and other tall mountains to the west of Snake Valley. [[Great Basin National Park]] is just over the Nevada state line in the southern Snake Range. One of western Utah's most impressive, but least visited attractions is [[Notch Peak]], the tallest limestone cliff in North America, located west of [[Delta, Utah|Delta]].

Much of the scenic southern and southeastern landscape (specifically the [[Colorado Plateau]] region) is [[sandstone]], specifically [[Kayenta Formation|Kayenta sandstone]] and [[Navajo sandstone]]. The [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] and its tributaries wind their way through the sandstone, creating some of the world's most striking and wild terrain (the area around the confluence of the Colorado and Green Rivers was the last to be mapped in the lower 48 United States). Wind and rain have also sculpted the soft sandstone over millions of years. Canyons, gullies, arches, pinnacles, buttes, bluffs, and mesas are the common sight throughout south-central and southeast Utah.

This terrain is the central feature of protected state and federal parks such as [[Arches National Park|Arches]], [[Bryce Canyon National Park|Bryce Canyon]], [[Canyonlands National Park|Canyonlands]], [[Capitol Reef National Park|Capitol Reef]], and [[Zion National Park|Zion]] national parks, [[Cedar Breaks National Monument|Cedar Breaks]], [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument|Grand Staircase-Escalante]], [[Hovenweep National Monument|Hovenweep]], and [[Natural Bridges National Monument|Natural Bridges]] national monuments, [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]] (site of the popular tourist destination, [[Lake Powell]]), [[Dead Horse Point State Park|Dead Horse Point]] and [[Goblin Valley State Park|Goblin Valley]] state parks, and [[Monument Valley]]. The [[Navajo Nation]] also extends into southeastern Utah. Southeastern Utah is also punctuated by the remote, but lofty [[La Sal Mountains|La Sal]], [[Abajo Mountains|Abajo]], and [[Henry Mountains|Henry]] mountain ranges.

Eastern (northern quarter) Utah is a high-elevation area covered mostly by plateaus and basins, particularly the Tavaputs Plateau and [[San Rafael Swell]], which remain mostly inaccessible, and the [[Uinta Basin]], where the majority of eastern Utah's population lives. Economies are dominated by mining, [[oil shale]], [[Petroleum|oil]], and natural gas-drilling, [[ranching]], and [[recreation]]. Much of eastern Utah is part of the [[Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation]]. The most popular destination within northeastern Utah is [[Dinosaur National Monument]] near [[Vernal, Utah|Vernal]].

Southwestern Utah is the lowest and hottest spot in Utah. It is known as Utah's [[Dixie (Utah)|Dixie]] because early settlers were able to grow some cotton there. [[Beaverdam Wash]] in far southwestern Utah is the lowest point in the state, at {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}.<ref name="usgs"/> The northernmost portion of the [[Mojave Desert]] is also located in this area. Dixie is quickly becoming a popular recreational and retirement destination, and the population is growing rapidly. Although the Wasatch Mountains end at [[Mount Nebo (Utah)|Mount Nebo]] near [[Nephi, Utah|Nephi]], a complex series of mountain ranges extends south from the southern end of the range down the spine of Utah. Just north of Dixie and east of [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]] is the state's highest ski resort, [[Brian Head Ski Resort|Brian Head]].

Like most of the [[The West (U.S.)|western]] and [[Southwest United States|southwestern]] states, the [[Government of the United States|federal government]] owns much of the land in Utah. Over 70 percent of the land is either [[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] [[public land|land]], Utah State Trustland, or [[U.S. National Forest]], [[U.S. National Park]], [[U.S. National Monument]], [[National Recreation Area]] or [[U.S. Wilderness Area]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0304/Utah-fights-for-states-rights-with-land-push|title=Utah fights for states' rights with land push|last=Farrell|first=Michael B.|newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=March 4, 2014|access-date=October 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020072312/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0304/Utah-fights-for-states-rights-with-land-push|archive-date=October 20, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Utah is the only state where every county contains some national forest.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.utah.gov/governor/docs/OutdoorRecreationVision.pdf |title=The state of Utah outdoor recreation vision. |date=January 2013 |access-date=October 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111174839/https://www.utah.gov/governor/docs/OutdoorRecreationVision.pdf |archive-date=November 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Climate===

[[File:Utah Köppen.svg|thumb|left|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Utah]]

Utah features a dry, [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] to [[desert climate]],{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} although its many mountains feature a large variety of climates, with the highest points in the [[Uinta Mountains]] being above the [[Tree line|timberline]]. The dry weather is a result of the state's location in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in California. The eastern half of the state lies in the rain shadow of the [[Wasatch Mountains]]. The primary source of precipitation for the state is the Pacific Ocean, with the state usually lying in the path of large Pacific storms from October to May. In summer, the state, especially southern and eastern Utah, lies in the path of [[monsoon]] moisture from the [[Gulf of California]].

Most of the lowland areas receive less than {{convert|12|in|mm|0}} of precipitation annually, although the [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]] corridor, including the densely populated [[Wasatch Front]], receives approximately {{convert|15|in|mm|0}}. The [[Great Salt Lake Desert]] is the driest area of the state, with less than {{convert|5|in|mm|0}}. Snowfall is common in all but the far southern valleys. Although [[St. George, Utah|St. George]] receives only about {{convert|3|in|mm|0}} per year, Salt Lake City sees about {{convert|60|in|mm|0}}, enhanced by the [[lake-effect snow]] from the [[Great Salt Lake]], which increases snowfall totals to the south, southeast, and east of the lake.

Some areas of the [[Wasatch Range]] in the path of the lake-effect receive up to {{convert|500|in|mm|0}} per year. This micro climate of enhanced snowfall from the Great Salt Lake spans the entire proximity of the lake. The cottonwood canyons adjacent to Salt Lake City are located in the right position to receive more precipitation from the lake.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steenburgh|first1=Jim|title=Secrets of the Greatest Snow on Earth|date=November 14, 2014|publisher=Utah State University Press|isbn=978-0874219500|edition=1}}</ref> The consistently deep powder snow led Utah's ski industry to adopt the slogan "the Greatest Snow on Earth" in the 1980s. In the winter, [[temperature inversion]]s are a common phenomenon across Utah's low basins and valleys, leading to thick haze and fog that can last for weeks at a time, especially in the [[Uintah Basin]]. Although at other times of year its air quality is good, winter inversions give Salt Lake City some of the worst wintertime pollution in the country.

Previous studies have indicated a widespread decline in snowpack over Utah accompanied by a decline in the snow–precipitation ratio while anecdotal evidence claims have been put forward that measured changes in Utah's snowpack are spurious and do not reflect actual change. A 2012 study<ref>[http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00084.1 2012 study] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512142725/http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00084.1 |date=May 12, 2017 }}, journals.ametsoc.org.</ref> found that the proportion of winter (January–March) precipitation falling as snow has decreased by nine percent during the last half century, a combined result from a significant increase in rainfall and a minor decrease in snowfall. Meanwhile, observed snow depth across Utah has decreased and is accompanied by consistent decreases in snow cover and surface albedo. Weather systems with the potential to produce precipitation in Utah have decreased in number with those producing snowfall decreasing at a considerably greater rate.<ref>Gillies et al. (2012) http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00084.1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512142725/http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00084.1 |date=May 12, 2017 }}</ref>

Utah's temperatures are extreme, with cold temperatures in winter due to its elevation, and very hot summers statewide (with the exception of mountain areas and high mountain valleys). Utah is usually protected from major blasts of cold air by mountains lying north and east of the state, although major Arctic blasts can occasionally reach the state. Average January high temperatures range from around {{convert|30|F|C|0}} in some northern valleys to almost {{convert|55|F|C|0}} in St. George.

Temperatures dropping below {{convert|0|F|C|0}} should be expected on occasion in most areas of the state most years, although some areas see it often (for example, the town of [[Randolph, Utah|Randolph]] averages about fifty days per year with temperatures that low).

Utah, like most of the western United States, has few days of thunderstorms. On average there are fewer than 40 days of thunderstorm activity during the year, although these storms can be briefly intense when they do occur. They are most likely to occur during [[North American Monsoon|monsoon]] season from about mid-July through mid-September, especially in southern and eastern Utah. Dry lightning strikes and the general dry weather often spark wildfires in summer, while intense thunderstorms can lead to [[flash flood]]ing, especially in the rugged terrain of southern Utah. Although spring is the wettest season in northern Utah, late summer is the wettest period for much of the south and east of the state. Tornadoes are uncommon in Utah, with an average of two striking the state yearly, rarely higher than EF1 intensity.<ref>[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953–2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |date=October 16, 2011 }}.

===Languages===

The [[official language]] in the state of Utah is [[English language|English]]. [[Utah English]] is primarily a merger of Northern and Midland American dialects carried west by LDS Church members, whose original [[New York (state)|New York]] dialect later incorporated features from southern [[Ohio]] and central [[Illinois]]. Conspicuous in the speech of some in the central valley, although less frequent now in [[Salt Lake City]], is a reversal of [[vowels]], so that ''farm'' and ''barn'' sound like ''form'' and ''born'' and, conversely, ''form'' and ''born'' sound like ''farm'' and ''barn''.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In 2000, 87.5% of all state residents five years of age or older spoke only English at home, a decrease from 92.2% in 1990.

The [[Moab, Utah|Moab]] area, in the southeastern part of the state, is known for its challenging mountain biking trails, including [[Slickrock Trail|Slickrock]]. Moab also hosts the famous [[Moab Jeep Safari]] semiannually.

Utah has seen an increase in tourism since the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. [[Park City, Utah|Park City]] is home to the [[United States Ski Team]]. Utah's ski resorts are primarily located in northern Utah near [[Salt Lake City]], Park City, [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]].

====Branding====

The state of Utah relies heavily on income from tourists and travelers visiting the state's parks and ski resorts, and thus the need to "brand" Utah and create an impression of the state throughout the world has led to several state slogans, the most famous of which being "The Greatest Snow on Earth", which has been in use in Utah officially since 1975 (although the slogan was in unofficial use as early as 1962) and now adorns nearly 50 percent of the state's license plates. In 2001, Utah Governor [[Mike Leavitt]] approved a new state slogan, "Utah! Where Ideas Connect", which lasted until March 10, 2006, when the Utah Travel Council and the office of [[Jon Huntsman Jr.|Governor Jon Huntsman]] announced that "Life Elevated" would be the new state slogan.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://www.visitutah.com/ | title = Visit Utah | type = official site | place = UT | publisher = Office of Tourism | access-date = November 7, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151107011407/http://www.visitutah.com/ | archive-date = November 7, 2015 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Beginning in the late 19th century with the state's mining boom (including the [[Bingham Canyon Mine]], among the world's largest open pit mines), companies attracted large numbers of [[immigrants]] with job opportunities. Since the days of the [[Utah Territory]] mining has played a major role in Utah's economy. Historical mining towns include [[Mercur, Utah|Mercur]] in Tooele County, [[Silver Reef, Utah|Silver Reef]] in Washington County, [[Eureka, Utah|Eureka]] in Juab County, [[Park City, Utah|Park City]] in Summit County and numerous coal mining camps throughout Carbon County such as Castle Gate, Spring Canyon, and Hiawatha.<ref name="Highlights">Utah Department of Community and Culture, Mining Heritage Alliance, [http://history.utah.gov/mining_heritage_alliance/highlights.html Highlights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117095118/http://history.utah.gov/mining_heritage_alliance/highlights.html |date=January 17, 2013 }} http://finance.utah.gov/highlights.html  as found at Utah.gov http://finance.utah.gov/highlights.html</ref>

These settlements were characteristic of the boom and bust cycle that dominated mining towns of the American West. Park City, Utah, and Alta, Utah were a boom towns in the early twentieth centuries. Rich silver mines in the mountains adjacent to the towns led to many people flocking to the towns in search of wealth. During the early part of the [[Cold War]] era, uranium was mined in eastern Utah. Today mining activity still plays a major role in the state's economy. Minerals mined in Utah include copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, zinc, lead, and beryllium. Fossil fuels including coal, petroleum, and natural gas continue to play a large role in Utah's economy, especially in the eastern part of the state in counties such as Carbon, Emery, Grand, and Uintah.<ref name="Highlights"/>

====Incidents====

In 2007, nine people were killed at the [[Crandall Canyon Mine]] collapse.

On March 22, 2013, one miner died and another was injured after they became trapped in a cave-in at a part of the [[Castle Valley, Utah|Castle Valley Mining Complex]], about {{convert|16|km}} west of the small mining town of [[Huntington, Utah|Huntington]] in [[Emery County, Utah|Emery County]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Officials: Miner dead, 1 rescued in Utah cave-in|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57575938/officials-miner-dead-1-rescued-in-utah-cave-in/|publisher=CBS News|access-date=March 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323093833/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57575938/officials-miner-dead-1-rescued-in-utah-cave-in/|archive-date=March 23, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]] and [[Interstate 80 in Utah|I-80]] are the main [[Interstate Highway System|interstate]] highways in the state, where they intersect and briefly merge near [[downtown Salt Lake City]]. I-15 traverses the state north-to-south, entering from [[Arizona]] near [[St. George, Utah|St. George]], paralleling the [[Wasatch Front]], and crossing into [[Idaho]] near [[Portage, Utah|Portage]]. I-80 spans northern Utah east-to-west, entering from [[Nevada]] at [[Wendover, Utah|Wendover]], crossing the [[Wasatch Mountains]] east of Salt Lake City, and entering [[Wyoming]] near [[Evanston, Wyoming|Evanston]]. [[Interstate 84 in Utah|I-84]] West enters from Idaho near [[Snowville, Utah|Snowville]] (from [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]]) and merges with I-15 from [[Tremonton, Utah|Tremonton]] to [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], then heads southeast through the Wasatch Mountains before terminating at I-80 near [[Echo, Utah|Echo Junction]].

[[Interstate 70 in Utah|I-70]] splits from I-15 at [[Cove Fort, Utah|Cove Fort]] in central Utah and heads east through mountains and rugged desert terrain, providing quick access to the many national parks and national monuments of southern Utah, and has been noted for its beauty. The {{convert|103|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} stretch from [[Salina, Utah|Salina]] to [[Green River, Utah|Green River]] is the country's longest stretch of interstate without services and, when completed in 1970, was the longest stretch of entirely new highway constructed in the U.S. since the [[Alaska Highway]] was completed in 1943.

[[TRAX (light rail)|TRAX]], a [[light rail]] system in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], consists of three lines. The [[Blue Line (TRAX)|Blue Line]] (formerly Salt Lake/Sandy Line) begins in the suburb of [[Draper, Utah|Draper]] and ends in [[Downtown Salt Lake City]]. The [[Red Line (TRAX)|Red Line]] (Mid-Jordan/University Line) begins in the [[Daybreak Community]] of [[South Jordan, Utah|South Jordan]], a southwestern valley suburb, and ends at the [[University of Utah]]. The [[Green Line (TRAX)|Green Line]] begins in [[West Valley, Utah|West Valley City]], passes through downtown Salt Lake City, and ends at [[Salt Lake City International Airport]].

The [[Utah Transit Authority|Utah Transit Authority (UTA)]], which operates TRAX, also operates a bus system that stretches across the Wasatch Front, west into [[Grantsville, Utah|Grantsville]], and east into [[Park City, Utah|Park City]]. In addition, UTA provides winter service to the ski resorts east of Salt Lake City, Ogden, and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]]. Several bus companies also provide access to the ski resorts in winter, and local bus companies also serve the cities of [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]], [[Logan, Utah|Logan]], Park City, and [[St. George, Utah|St. George]]. A [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] line known as ''[[FrontRunner]]'', also operated by UTA, runs between [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] via Salt Lake City. [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[California Zephyr]]'', with one train in each direction daily, runs east–west through Utah with stops in [[Green River, Utah|Green River]], [[Helper, Utah|Helper]], Provo, and Salt Lake City.

[[Salt Lake City International Airport]] is the only international airport in the state and serves as one of the hubs for [[Delta Air Lines]]. The airport has consistently ranked first in on-time departures and had the fewest cancellations among U.S. airports.<ref>[http://www.transtats.bts.gov/airports.asp?pn=1 U.S. Department of Transportation Bureau of Statistics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012160433/http://www.transtats.bts.gov/airports.asp?pn=1 |date=October 12, 2008 }} Retrieved on March 5, 2008.</ref> The airport has non-stop service to more than a hundred destinations throughout the United States, Canada, and [[Mexico]], as well as to [[Amsterdam]], [[London]] and [[Paris]]. [[Canyonlands Field]] (near [[Moab, Utah|Moab]]), [[Cedar City Regional Airport]], [[Ogden-Hinckley Airport]], [[Provo Municipal Airport]], [[St. George Regional Airport]], and [[Vernal Regional Airport]] all provide limited commercial air service. A new regional airport at St. George opened on January 12, 2011. [[SkyWest Airlines]] is also headquartered in St. George and maintains a hub at Salt Lake City.

Utah government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The current governor of Utah is [[Gary Herbert]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utah.gov/governor/ |title=State of Utah: Office of the Governor |publisher=Utah.gov |date=July 20, 2010 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903005335/http://www.utah.gov/governor/ |archive-date=September 3, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> who was sworn in on August 11, 2009. The governor is elected for a four-year term. The [[Utah State Legislature]] consists of a [[Utah State Senate|Senate]] and a [[Utah State House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. State senators serve four-year terms and representatives two-year terms. The Utah Legislature meets each year in January for an annual 45-day session.

The [[Utah Supreme Court]] is the court of last resort in Utah. It consists of five justices, who are appointed by the governor, and then subject to retention election. The [[Utah Court of Appeals]] handles cases from the trial courts.<ref>Utah State Courts, [http://www.utcourts.gov/courts/appell/ Utah Court of Appeals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122050432/http://www.utcourts.gov/courts/appell/ |date=January 22, 2009 }}</ref> Trial level courts are the district courts and justice courts. All justices and judges, like those on the Utah Supreme Court, are subject to [[retention election]] after appointment.

===Women's rights===

{{Further|Women's suffrage in Utah}}

Utah granted full [[suffrage|voting rights]] to women in 1870, 26 years before becoming a state. Among all U.S. states, only [[Wyoming]] granted [[Women's suffrage|suffrage to women]] earlier.<ref>National Constitution Center, [http://www.constitutioncenter.org/timeline/html/cw08_12159.html Map: States grant women the right to vote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814035603/http://www.constitutioncenter.org/timeline/html/cw08_12159.html |date=August 14, 2007 }}</ref> However, in 1887 the initial [[Edmunds-Tucker Act]] was passed by Congress in an effort to curtail Mormon influence in the territorial government. One of the provisions of the Act was the repeal of women's suffrage; full suffrage was not returned until Utah was admitted to the Union in 1896.

Utah is one of the 15 states that have not ratified the U.S. [[Equal Rights Amendment]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/ratified.htm |title=Thirty-Five States Have Ratified the Equal Rights Amendment |website=equalrightsamendment.org |access-date=August 3, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325173052/http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/ratified.htm |archive-date=March 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Free-range parenting===

In March 2018, Utah passed America's first "free-range parenting" bill.

===Constitution===

{{Main|Constitution of Utah}}

The constitution of Utah was enacted in 1895. Notably, the constitution outlawed [[polygamy]], as requested by Congress when Utah had applied for statehood, and reestablished the territorial practice of women's [[suffrage]]. Utah's Constitution has been [[Constitutional amendment|amended]] many times since its inception.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040821110158/http://elections.utah.gov/ConstitutionalAmendments.htm Constitutional Amendments, Initiatives & Referendums].

===Alcohol, tobacco and gambling laws===

{{see also|List of alcohol laws of the United States}}

Utah's laws in regard to [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], tobacco and gambling are strict. Utah is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]]. The [[Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control]] regulates the sale of alcohol; wine and spirituous liquors may be purchased only at state liquor stores, and local laws may prohibit the sale of beer and other alcoholic beverages on Sundays. The state bans the sale of fruity alcoholic drinks at grocery stores and convenience stores. The law states that such drinks must now have new state-approved labels on the front of the products that contain capitalized letters in bold type telling consumers the drinks contain alcohol and at what percentage. The Utah Indoor Clean Air Act is a statewide [[smoking ban]] that prohibits it in many public places.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.le.utah.gov/UtahCode/section.jsp?code=26-38 |title=Utah State Legislature |publisher=Le.utah.gov |access-date=December 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209182105/http://www.le.utah.gov/UtahCode/section.jsp?code=26-38 |archive-date=February 9, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Utah and Hawaii are the only two states in the United States to outlaw all forms of gambling.

In the late 19th century, the federal government took issue with polygamy in the LDS Church. The LDS Church discontinued plural marriage in 1890, and in 1896 Utah gained admission to the Union. Many new people settled the area soon after the Mormon pioneers. Relations have often been strained between the LDS population and the non-LDS population.<ref>{{Cite book |first= James B. |last= Allen |author-link= James B.

In [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] Utah was only the third-most Republican state (after [[Wyoming]] and [[Oklahoma]]), but in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], with Mormon [[Mitt Romney]] atop the Republican ticket, Utah returned to its position as the most Republican state. However, the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] result saw Republican [[Donald Trump]] carry the state (marking the thirteenth consecutive win by the Republican presidential candidate) with only a plurality, the first time this happened since [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].

Both Utah's [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]], [[Mitt Romney]] and [[Mike Lee (Utah politician)|Mike Lee]], are Republican. Three more Republicans—[[Rob Bishop]], [[Chris Stewart (politician)|Chris Stewart]], and [[John Curtis (Utah politician)|John Curtis]]—represent Utah in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. [[Ben McAdams]], the sole Democratic member of the Utah delegation, represents the [[Utah's 4th congressional district|4th congressional district]], though he lost re-election to Burgress Owens, a Republican, in 2020. After Jon Huntsman Jr. resigned to serve as U.S. Ambassador to China, [[Gary Herbert]] was sworn in as governor on August 11, 2009. Herbert was elected to serve out the remainder of the term in a special election in 2010, defeating Democratic nominee Salt Lake County Mayor Peter Corroon with 64% of the vote. He won election to a full four-year term in 2012, defeating the Democrat Peter Cooke with 68% of the vote.

[[David Magleby]], dean of Social and Behavioral Sciences at [[Brigham Young University]], a lifelong Democrat and a political analyst, asserts that the Republican Party actually has more conservative positions than the LDS Church. Magleby argues that the locally conservative Democrats are in better accord with LDS doctrine.<ref>{{cite news|title=Far Right Wing of Utah GOP at Odds With LDS Positions |last=Rolly |first=Paul |date=April 28, 2002 |newspaper=[[Salt Lake Tribune]]}}</ref> For example, the Republican Party of Utah opposes almost all abortions while Utah Democrats take a more liberal approach, although more conservative than their national counterparts. On [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] issues, the state GOP has been at odds with the LDS Church position opposing concealed firearms in places of worship and in public spaces.

In 1998 the church expressed concern that Utahns perceived the Republican Party as an LDS institution and authorized lifelong Democrat and [[Quorums of the Seventy|Seventy]] [[Marlin K. Jensen|Marlin Jensen]] to promote LDS bipartisanship.<ref name="Marlin Jensen"/>

Utah is much more conservative than the United States as a whole, particularly on social issues.
