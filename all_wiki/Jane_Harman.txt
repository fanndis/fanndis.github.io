==Career==
===Early career===
After graduating from [[Harvard law school|law school]], Harman - then known as Jane Lakes - married future NOAA administrator [[Richard A. Frank]] in 1969, and they had two children. They spent a short time in Switzerland and then she worked for two years as an associate with the law firm Surrey, Karasik and Morse in Washington, DC. She began her political career by serving on the staff of Senator [[John V. Tunney]], and as his staff director from 1972-73. In 1973, Tunney named her his chief counsel and staff director for the [[United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights|Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights]]. During this time she also taught at Georgetown. When Tunney lost re-election in 1976, Harman - then known as Jane Lakes Frank - joined the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter White House]] where she served as special counsel to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and as Deputy Secretary of the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]]. She made headlines in 1978, when she quit to spend more time with her children. She and her husband, Richard Frank divorced the same year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Personality Glimpses|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/980495/?terms=%22Jane%2BLakes%22%2BWhite%2BHouse |accessdate=May 8, 2018|work=The Salinas Journal|date=June 2, 1978}}</ref><ref name="CongBio">{{cite web|title=HARMAN, Jane L|url=http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/14550|accessdate=May 7, 2018}}</ref> Two years later, she married [[Sidney Harman]], who she had met in the White House when he was her first husband's boss.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wz9OB2xLGecC&pg=PA832|title=Women in Congress, 1917-2006|date=September 26, 2018|publisher=Government Printing Office|accessdate=September 26, 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780160767531}}</ref><ref name="StoneBook">{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=Kurt F.|title=The Jews of Capitol Hill: A Compendium of Jewish Congressional Members|date=2010|page=518|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACTF56SnaykC&pg=PA518|accessdate=May 8, 2018|isbn=9780810877382}}</ref> Through the 1980s, Jane Harman worked as a corporate lawyer and as a director of her husband's company, Harman International Industries.<ref name="CongBio"/>

===U.S. Representative, 1993 to 1999===
Harman was first elected to [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] in 1992 and became the first Smith College graduate to be elected to Congress. From 1993 to 1999, Harman represented the [[California's 36th congressional district|36th]], serving in the [[103rd United States Congress|103rd]], [[104th United States Congress|104th]], and [[105th Congress]]es. In 1994, she barely survived reelection in a heavily [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] year, winning by 812 votes over [[Rancho Palos Verdes, California|Rancho Palos Verdes]] Mayor Susan Brooks.

===1998 California gubernatorial campaign===
Harman did not run for the [[106th United States Congress]] in 1998, instead entering the [[California gubernatorial election, 1998|1998 California gubernatorial race]]. It was during that race that she was called "the best [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]".<ref name="harman29">{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/23/news/mn-31902|title=California and the West: In the Ring, With Contenders for Governor |accessdate=June 23, 2013|date=March 23, 1998|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=3|last=Skelton|first=George}}</ref>

After losing the Democratic nomination to [[Lieutenant Governor of California|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Gray Davis]], she briefly taught [[public policy]] and [[international relations]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] as a Regents' Professor before running for and [[United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2000#District 36|winning her old congressional seat in the 2000 election]].

===U.S. Representative, 2000 to 2011===
[[File:Jane Harman, official portrait, 111th Congress.jpg|thumb|upright|Harman's portrait during her second term as US Rep]]
Harman narrowly won her old seat in 2000, defeating Republican incumbent [[Steven T. Kuykendall]], and was easily re-elected in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010.

Representing the [[aerospace]] center of California during her nine terms in Congress, she served on all the major security committees: six years on [[House Armed Services Committee|Armed Services]], eight years on [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], and eight on [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|Homeland Security]]. She made numerous congressional fact-finding missions to hotspots around the world, including [[North Korea]], [[Syria]], [[Libya]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Yemen]], and [[Guantanamo Bay]]. During her long public career, Harman has been recognized as a national expert at the nexus of security and public policy issues. She received the Defense Department Medal for Distinguished Service in 1998, the CIA [[Agency Seal Medal]] in 2007, and the CIA Director's Award and the Director of National Intelligence [[National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Public Service Medal]] in 2011.

===2009 wiretap/AIPAC allegations===
In 2009, it was revealed [[NSA]] wiretaps reportedly intercepted a 2005 phone call between Harman and an agent of the Israeli government, in which Harman allegedly agreed to lobby the Justice Department to reduce or drop criminal charges against two employees of [[AIPAC]] in exchange for increased support for Harman's campaign to chair the [[House Intelligence Committee]].<ref name=NSA>{{cite news|title=Jane Harman's Wiretapped Conversations|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 21, 2009 |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/washingtonpostinvestigations/2009/04/jane_harmans_mysterious_conver.html|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}</ref> The NSA transcripts reportedly recorded Harman ending the phone call after saying, "this conversation doesn't exist."<ref name=NSASalon>{{cite news|title=Major scandal erupts involving Rep. Jane Harman, Alberto Gonzales and AIPAC|work=Salon|date=April 20, 2009|url=http://www.salon.com/2009/04/20/harman/|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}</ref> It was reported that [[Alberto Gonzales]], [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] at the time of the phone call, blocked Justice Department lawyers from continuing the investigation into Harman (in spite of the alleged crime) because the Bush administration "needed Jane" to support their warrantless wiretapping program, which was soon to be revealed to the public by ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name=Atlantic>{{cite magazine|title=The Danger of NSA Spying on Members of Congress|magazine=The Atlantic|date=January 6, 2014|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/the-danger-of-nsa-spying-on-members-of-congress/282827/|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}</ref>

Harman denied the allegations, and called for the government to release the full transcript of the wire-tapped conversation, something they never did.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|title=Pelosi Now Remembers Harman Wiretap|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2009|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/pelosi-now-remembers-harman-wiretap/|accessdate=February 27, 2014|first=David M.|last=Herszenhorn}}</ref> In June 2009, Harman received a letter from the Justice Department declaring her "neither a subject nor a target of an ongoing investigation by the Criminal Division." Though the espionage charges were later dropped on the two employees from AIPAC, against the wishes of the FBI, Harman did not become chair of the House intelligence committee.<ref name=JusticeRollCall>{{cite news|title=Justice Department Not Targeting Harman|publisher=Roll Call|date=June 25, 2009 |url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/-36295-1.html|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}</ref>

===Political positions===
Harman is on most issues a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], earning a 95% rating from the liberal group [[Americans for Democratic Action]]. On intelligence and defense issues, Ben Pershing described her as a centrist. For example, she was one of many Democrats who supported the [[Iraq War]].<ref name=P&H>{{cite news|title=Pelosi, Harman Have Long History|newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 23, 2009|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2009/04/pelosi_harman_have_long_histor.html?hpid=news-col-blog|accessdate=April 25, 2009}}</ref> Harman has combined a moderate stance on economic, trade, and foreign policy issues with a more liberal stance on social issues. For instance, while voting with Republicans to restrict rules on [[personal bankruptcy]], for [[tort reform|lawsuit reform]], and to abolish the [[estate tax]]—as well as on protecting those [[defense contractor]]s with business interests in her congressional district—Harman voted against the ban on [[partial-birth abortions]], lawsuits against gun manufacturers, the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], and banning indecent broadcasting. Harmon's California Senate Bill 1264, signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, effective January 1, 2010, rendered most no-contest clauses unenforceable. The many loopholes in prior no-contest clauses caused more court confusion and expense.

====Armenian Genocide====
Harman was a co-sponsor of the [[Armenian Genocide]] [[United States resolution on Armenian genocide|recognition resolution bill]] in 2007. However, while still cosponsoring the bill, she wrote a letter to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair [[Tom Lantos]] urging him to delay a floor vote on the legislation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cbs2.com/local/Rep.Jane.Harman.2.536739.html |title=House Rep. Flip-Flops On Armenian Genocide Stance |agency=Associated Press |publisher=CBS |date=October 10, 2007 }}</ref> Her argument was that while the genocide deserved recognition, it was not a good time to embarrass [[Turkey]], given that country's role in moderating extremism in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2007/10/harman-flip-flo.html |title=Harman flip-flops on Armenian genocide resolution |first=John |last= Healey |newspaper=LA Times |date=October 5, 2007 }}</ref>

===Other activities===
Harman is currently a member of the [[Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee|Defense Policy Board]], the State Department [[Foreign Affairs Policy Board]], the [[Director of National Intelligence]]’s [[National Intelligence Board|Senior Advisory Group]], and the [[Homeland Security Advisory Council]]. She was a member of the CIA External Advisory Board from 2011 to 2013. Harman is a Trustee of the [[Aspen Institute]] and the [[University of Southern California]]. She also serves on the Board of Directors of the [[Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget]]. She is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of [[Issue One]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.issueone.org/reformers/#reformer-full-list | title=Issue One – ReFormers Caucus}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Harman's first marriage was to Richard Frank, in 1969, with whom she had two children.<ref name="papers">{{cite web |url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss360_bioghist.html|title=Jane Harman Papers, 1960-1998 (ongoing) (bulk 1993-1998) Finding Aid|first=Harman|last=Jane|website=asteria.fivecolleges.edu|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}</ref> Her second marriage was to audio pioneer and multi-millionaire [[Sidney Harman]], who served from 1977 to 1979 as the Undersecretary of the Department of Commerce in the [[Carter administration]] before repurchasing the company he founded, [[Harman International Industries]], and later taking it public.<ref name="obit">Shapiro, Taylor (2011).

Asked in 2010 about a possible [[conflict of interest]], Sidney Harman said: "We’ve been married for over 30 years.
