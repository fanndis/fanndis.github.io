'''''Bild''''' (or '''''Bild-Zeitung''''', literally ''Picture''; {{IPA-de|ˈbɪlt|}}) is a German [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] newspaper published by [[Axel Springer SE]]. The paper is published from Monday to Saturday; on Sundays, its sister paper ''[[Bild am Sonntag]]'' ("''Bild on Sunday''") is published instead, which has a different style and its own editors. ''Bild'' is tabloid in style but [[broadsheet]] in size. It is the [[List of newspapers in the world by circulation|best-selling European newspaper]] and has the sixteenth-largest circulation worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anp.cl/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WAN-IFRA_WPT_2016_3.pdf|title=World Press Trends 2016|last=Milosevic|first=Mira|date=2016|publisher=WAN-IFRA|page=58|access-date=January 15, 2018}}</ref> Bild has been described as "notorious for its mix of gossip, inflammatory language, and sensationalism" and as having a huge influence on German politicians.<ref name=CSM>{{cite news|last=Steininger|first=Michael|title=German tabloid Bild takes down politicians with its unmatched megaphone|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2012/0118/German-tabloid-Bild-takes-down-politicians-with-its-unmatched-megaphone|access-date=22 March 2012|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=18 January 2012}}</ref> Its nearest English-language stylistic and journalistic equivalent is often considered to be the [[United Kingdom|British]] national newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', the second-highest-selling European tabloid newspaper, with which it shares a degree of rivalry.<ref name=spiegel06>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,412021,00.html Sex, Smut and Shock: Bild Zeitung Rules Germany] [[Spiegel Online]] 25 April 2006</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/travel/news/article4054327.ece| work=The Times|first=Sadie|last=Gray|title=Germans equalise with penalty gibe in a shootout over sun loungers and clichés}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/12/11/sfnwee11.xml|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| title=Sport}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Bild Automat.jpg|thumb|left|125px|''Bild'' tabloid vending machine in Germany]]
''Bild'' was founded by [[Axel Springer]] in 1952. It mostly consisted of pictures (hence the name ''Bild'', [[German language|German]] for picture). ''Bild'' soon became the best-selling tabloid, by a wide margin, not only in Germany, but in all of Europe, though essentially to German readers. Through most of its history, ''Bild'' was based in Hamburg. The paper moved its headquarters to Berlin in March 2008, stating that it was an essential base of operations for a national newspaper.<ref>"[https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article1808818/Die-Bild-Zeitung-ist-jetzt-ein-Berliner.html Die "Bild"-Zeitung ist jetzt ein Berliner]" {{in lang|de}}. ''Die Welt''. 17 March 2008. Retrieved 28 November 2016.</ref> It is printed nationwide with 32 localized editions. Special editions are printed in some favoured German holiday destinations abroad such as Spain, Italy, Turkey and Greece.

''Bild'' sold more than five million copies every day in the 1980s. In 1993 the paper had a circulation of slightly more than four million copies, making it the most read newspaper in the country.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Humphreys|title=Mass Media and Media Policy in Western Europe|date=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|page=82|url=http://www.google.com.tr/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2vlTzbOGhdIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR6&dq=media+and+magazines+in+central+europe&ots=rDZApnAeFb&sig=3smUcJ-cI-LHdK1BuERlh1TnG4I&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|access-date=29 October 2014}}</ref> In the period of 1995–96 its circulation was 4,300,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Media Policy: Convergence, Concentration & Commerce|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6HU9WdjwgkC&pg=PA7|access-date=3 February 2014|date=24 September 1998|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-6524-6|page=10}}</ref> In 2001 ''Bild'' was the most read newspaper in [[Europe]] and also, in Germany with a circulation of 4,396,000 copies.<ref name=adsm>{{cite news|author=Adam Smith|title=Europe's Top Papers|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/164161/|access-date=5 February 2015|work=campaign|date=15 November 2002}}</ref>

Although it is still Germany's biggest paper, the circulation of ''Bild'', along with many other papers, has been on the decline in recent years. By the end of 2005, the figure dropped to 3.8 million copies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ivw.de/|title=Startseite &#124; Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V.|website=www.ivw.de}}</ref> Its 2010 circulation was 3,548,000, making the paper the fifth in the list of the world's biggest selling newspapers.<ref>{{cite web|title=The world's biggest selling newspapers|url=http://www.pressrun.net/weblog/2010/09/the-worlds-biggest-selling-newspapers.html|work=pressrun|access-date=5 October 2013|date=19 October 2010|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131005155757/http://www.pressrun.net/weblog/2010/09/the-worlds-biggest-selling-newspapers.html|archive-date=5 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

''Bild'' is published in [[tabloid format]].<ref name=adsm/> In the paper's beginnings, Springer was influenced by the model of the British tabloid ''[[Daily Mirror]]'',<ref name=spiegel06/> although Bild's paper size is larger, this is reflected in its mix of celebrity gossip, crime stories and political analysis. However, its articles are often considerably shorter compared to those in British tabloids, and the whole paper is thinner as well.

In June 2012, Bild celebrated its 60th anniversary by giving away free newspapers to almost all of Germany's 41 million households. Bild said ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' in Germany has certified the print run as "the largest circulation for the free special edition of a newspaper".<ref>{{cite news|title=Germany's Bild newspaper becomes 60 and celebrates with 41m circulation|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2012/06/24/germany-s-bild-newspaper-becomes-60-and-celebrates-with-41m-circulation|access-date=23 January 2014|date=24 June 2012}}</ref> In 2018 on average 2.2 million copies of the paper were printed across Germany <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivw.de/aw/print/qa/titel/7110|title=Titelanzeige {{!}} Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V.|website=www.ivw.de|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> and 416,567 readers took advantage of the paid digital offer Bild plus.

In 2019 Bild started a weekly politic newspaper, named ''[[Bild Politik]]'', which ceased publications after a few months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meedia.de/2019/07/02/testphase-abgeschlossen-springers-magazin-bild-politik-erscheint-am-5-juli-vorerst-zum-letzten-mal/|title=Testphase abgeschlossen: Springers Magazin "Bild Politik" erscheint am 5.

===Editorial leanings===
[[File:Editorial office of Bild newspaper, West Berlin, 1977.jpg|thumb|right|Editors work on producing an issue of ''Bild,'' 1977 in West Berlin. Previous front pages are affixed to the wall behind them.]]
From the outset, the editorial drift was conservative and nationalist.<ref name=guardian-20200717/> The [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]] was referred to as the [[Soviet Occupation Zone]] (German: ''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'' or ''SBZ''). The usage continued well into the 1980s, when ''Bild'' began to use the GDR's official name cautiously, putting it in quotation marks. ''Bild'' (along with fellow Springer tabloid ''[[B.Z. (newspaper)|B.Z.]]'') heavily influenced public opinion against the [[German student movement]] and [[left-wing terrorism]] in the years following 1966, and was blamed by some for the climate that contributed to the assassination attempt on activist [[Rudi Dutschke]] in 1968—a popular catchphrase in left-wing circles sympathetic to student radicalism was "Bild hat mitgeschossen!" ("Bild shot at him too!").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/medienhetzer-und-politgammler.724.de.html?dram:article_id=99713|title=Medienhetzer und Politgammler: Springer und die 68er|publisher=[[Deutschlandfunk]]|language=de|date=18 January 2010|last=Meyer|first=Michael|access-date=24 March 2020}}</ref>

After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the end of the [[Cold War]] in Europe, ''Bild'' focused on celebrity stories and became less political.<ref name=guardian-20200717>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/16/bild-zeitung-tabloid-julian-reichelt-angela-merkel-germany |title=Bild, Merkel and the culture wars: the inside story of Germany's biggest tabloid |last=Meaney |first=Thomas |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 July 2020 |access-date=17 July 2020}}</ref> Despite its general support for Germany's conservative parties and especially former chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], its rhetoric, still populist in tone, is less fierce than it was thirty years ago.<ref name="guardian-20200717" /> Its traditionally less conservative Sunday paper ''[[Bild am Sonntag]]'' even supported [[Gerhard Schröder]], a [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]], in his bid for chancellor in 1998.

In 2004, ''Bild'' started to cooperate with fast-food giant McDonald's to sell the tabloid at its 1,000 fast-food restaurants in Germany. The cooperation still goes on, often enough by advertising the restaurant chain in "news" articles. Young women in skimpy clothes appeared on ''Bild's'' page one [[below the fold]] as ''Seite-eins-Mädchen'' or "Page One Girls". On 9 March 2012 ''Bild'' announced the elimination of the "Page One Girls", instead moving its fleshy photos to its inside pages.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,820361,00.html Ta Ta!: German Tabloid Strips Front Page of Daily Nude], ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', 3 September 2012</ref>

After Julian Reichelt became editor in 2018, ''Bild'' took a generally anti-[[Angela Merkel]] line, and strengthened its anti-Putin, pro-Nato, pro-Israel position.<ref name=guardian-20200717/>

==Motto==
Its [[motto]], prominently displayed below the logo, is ''unabhängig, überparteilich'' ("independent, nonpartisan"). Another slogan used prominently in advertising is ''Bild dir deine Meinung!'', which translates as "Form your own opinion!" (by reading ''Bild''), a pun based on the fact that, in [[German language|German]], ''Bild'' is a [[homophone]] of the imperative form of the [[verb]] ''bilden'' ({{lang-en|to form, to build, to educate}}) and the noun ''Bild'' ({{lang-en|picture, image}}).<ref>{{cite web|title= BILD |url=http://brandz.com/article/bild |access-date=28 November 2018|publisher=BrandZ}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= "Bild - unabhängig · überparteilich"?

==Print locations==
''Bild'' is printed in [[Ahrensburg]], Hanover, Berlin, Leipzig, [[Essen]], [[Neu-Isenburg]], [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]], Munich, and [[Syke]]. Outside of Germany it is also printed in Madrid, [[Palma de Mallorca]], [[Las Palmas]], Milan, Athens, and in [[Antalya]]. The foreign locations cater mostly for German tourists and expatriates.

==Controversy==
{{Criticism section|date=September 2020}}
''[[Der Spiegel]]'' wrote in 2006 that'' Bild'' "flies just under the nonsense threshold of American and British tabloids ... For the German desperate, it is a daily dose of high-resolution soft porn".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/sex-smut-and-shock-bild-zeitung-rules-germany-a-412021.html|title=Sex, Smut and Shock Bild Zeitung Rules Germany|work=Der Spiegel|date=25 April 2006|access-date=26 August 2012}}</ref> For 28 years from 1984 to 2012, ''Bild'' had [[toplessness|topless]] women featuring on its first page; in total, the paper published more than 5,000 topless pictures.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/mar/09/international-womens-day-germany|work=The Guardian|first=Roy| last=Greenslade|title=Bild banishes its topless model pictures after 28 years|date=9 March 2012}}</ref>

It is argued ''Bild'''s thirst for sensationalism results in the terrorizing of prominent celebrities and stories are frequently based on the most dubious evidence. The journalistic standards of ''Bild'' are the subject of frequent criticism.

* {{Interlanguage link multi|BILDblog|de}} is a popular German [[blog]] that when founded was dedicated solely to documenting errors and fabrications in ''Bild'' articles.<ref name=guardian-20200717/> In 2005 BILDblog received the ''[[Grimme Online Award]]'' for its work. Since 2009 BILDblog has also reported on errors and fabrications in other newspapers from Germany and elsewhere.
* [[Heinrich Böll]]'s 1974 novel ''[[The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum]]'', and the 1975 [[The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum (film)|movie]] based on it, used a fictional stand-in for ''Bild'' to make a point about its allegedly unethical journalistic practices. Böll's essay in the edition of 10 January 1972 of ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' (titled "{{Interlanguage link multi|Will Ulrike Gnade oder freies Geleit?|de}})<ref name=spiegelboell>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-43019376.html |title=Will Ulrike Gnade oder freies Geleit?

In the essay, Böll stated that what ''Bild'' does "isn’t [[Crypto-fascism|cryptofascist]] anymore, not fascistoid, but naked fascism. Agitation, lies, dirt."<ref name=spiegelboell/>
* In 1977 investigative journalist [[Günter Wallraff]] worked for four months as an editor for the ''Bild'' tabloid in [[Hanover]],<ref name=guardian-20200717/> giving himself the [[pseudonym]] of "Hans Esser". In his books ''Der Aufmacher'' ("Lead Story") and ''Zeugen der Anklage'' ("Witnesses for the Prosecution") he portrays his experiences on the editorial staff of the paper and the journalism which he encountered there. The staff commonly displayed contempt for humanity, a lack of respect for the privacy of ordinary people and widespread conduct of unethical research and editing techniques. Wallraff's investigations were also the basis for the 1990 film ''[[The Man Inside (1990 film)|The Man Inside]]''.
* In 2004 ''Bild'' was publicly reprimanded twelve times by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Deutscher Presserat|de}} (German Press Council).<ref name=spiegel06/> This amounts for a third of the reprimands this self-regulation council of the German press declared that year. As of 2012, it receives more reprimands from this watchdog body than any other newspaper.<ref name=CSM/>
* In their 2007 song ''[[Lasse redn]]'' (topped at no. 6 of the German charts), punk rock band ''[[Die Ärzte]]'' summarized ''Bild'''s content as "fear, hate, tits and the weather report" ''(Aus Angst, Hass, Titten und dem Wetterbericht)''.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/europe-s-largest-newspaper-publisher-a-bankrupt-media-company-is-better-than-a-government-funded-one-a-611534.html |title=Europe's Largest Newspaper Publisher: 'A Bankrupt Media Company Is Better Than a Government Funded One' |newspaper=Spiegel Online |date=5 March 2009}}</ref>

* [[Judith Holofernes]], lead singer of German band ''[[Wir sind Helden]]'', wrote a scathing open letter to Bild's advertising agency after they asked her to star in their latest campaign. "Bild is not a harmless guilty pleasure", she wrote, but a "dangerous political instrument—not only a high-magnification telescope into the abyss but an evil creature".<ref name="Pidd"/>
* In 2014 Sophia Becker and Kristina Lunz launched a campaign, [[Stop Bild Sexism]], to end the use of sexualized images of women in Bild. The campaign was inspired by the [[No More Page 3]] campaign to get ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' in the UK to stop publishing images of half-naked women on [[page 3]].<ref name=Local>{{cite news|last1=Barfield|first1=Tom|title=Meet the women fighting German tabloid sexism|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20150122/meet-the-women-fighting-tabloid-sexism-in-germany|access-date=29 January 2015|work=[[The Local|The Local (German edition)]]|date=22 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=Greenslade>{{cite news|last1=Greenslade|first1=Roy | author-link = Roy Greenslade |title=No More Page 3 inspires campaign against topless pictures in Germany|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/jan/23/no-more-page-3-inspires-campaign-against-topless-pictures-in-germany|access-date=29 January 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Kritik an Bild-Zeitung: Girls und Sexismus|url = http://www.sueddeutsche.de/medien/kritik-an-der-bild-zeitung-reduziert-auf-brueste-1.2326843|newspaper = [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|access-date = 20 August 2015|issn = 0174-4917|language = de|first = Kathleen|last = Hildebrand|date = 30 January 2015}}</ref> Lunz argues that ''Bild'''s frequent use of images of unclothed women makes its reporting of [[sexual assault]] and [[Sexual harassment|harassment]] "[[Sexism|sexist]] and [[Voyeurism|voyeuristic]]."<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.theeuropean.de/kristina-lunz/9751-sexismus-in-der-bild-zeitung|title = Der tägliche Herrenwitz.

*During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], ''Bild'' editor Julian Reichelt accused Chinese leader [[Xi Jinping]] of surveillance and other human rights crimes in an editorial titled "What China owes us" on 20 April 2020. After the Chinese embassy to Germany said that the ''Bild'' editorial reproached "nationalism, prejudice, and hostility against China", Reichelt responded “Your embassy tells me that I am not living up to the ‘traditional friendship of our peoples.’ I suppose you consider it a great ‘friendship’ when you now generously send masks around the world. This isn't friendship, I would call it [[imperialism]] hidden behind a smile — a [[Trojan Horse]]. You plan to strengthen China through a plague that you exported.

* During the [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] Paul Ronzheimer, the deputy editor-in-chief and correspondent of ''Bild'', tweeted that [[Ilham Aliyev]], the [[President of Azerbaijan]], agreed to be interviewed by the newspaper, and that he suddenly changed his mind, specifying that the Azerbaijani side itself offered to conduct an interview with Aliyev. Then, aide to the Azerbaijani President, [[Hikmet Hajiyev]], responded with a tweet, calling his statement unprofessional and stating that Aliyev preferred to give interviews to professional rather than the [[Yellow journalism|yellow press]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ria.ru/20201021/bild-1580914035.html |title=Помощник Алиева назвал немецкую газету Bild желтой прессой |date=22 October 2020 |access-date=22 October 2020 |language=ru |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] }}</ref>
