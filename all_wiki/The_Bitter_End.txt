'''The Bitter End''' is a 230-person capacity [[nightclub]], [[coffeehouse]] and [[folk music]] venue in [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]]. It opened in 1961 at [[Bleecker Street|147 Bleecker Street]] under the auspices of owner [[Fred Weintraub]]. The club changed its name to ''The Other End'' in June 1975. However, after a few years the owners changed the club's name back to the more recognizable The Bitter End. It remains open under new ownership.

==History==
An earlier club, The Cock and Bull, operated on the same premises with the same format, in the late 1950s. The poet and comedian [[Hugh Romney]] (who later became known as [[Wavy Gravy]]) read there.

The Bitter End was originally a coffeeshop.<ref name="Richling">{{cite news |last=Richling|first=Billy|date=February 18, 2014|title= Goodbye Paul Colby: Famed Owner of The Bitter End Passes Away |work=[[observer.com|Observer]] |url=http://observer.com/2014/02/goodbye-paul-colby-famed-owner-of-the-bitter-end-passes-away/ |access-date= September 28, 2017}}</ref> According to ''The New York Times'', "The Bitter End, which opened in 1961, considers itself to be New York’s oldest rock club and built a legendary reputation after showcasing young performers like [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[James Taylor]] and comedians like [[Woody Allen]] and [[Billy Crystal]]."

During the early 1960s, the club hosted [[folk music]] "[[Hootenanny|hootenannies]]" every Tuesday night, featuring many performers who have since become legendary.
