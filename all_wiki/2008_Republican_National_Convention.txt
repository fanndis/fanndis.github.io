The [[United States]] '''2008 Republican National Convention''' took place at the [[Xcel Energy Center]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], from September 1, through September 4, 2008.<ref name=RNCdecide>{{cite web | title =RNC Site Selection Committee To Recommend Minneapolis – St. Paul For 2008 Republican National Convention | publisher =Republican National Committee | date =2006-09-27 | url =http://www.gop.com/News/Read.aspx?ID=6600 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003729/http://www.gop.com/News/Read.aspx?ID=6600 | archive-date =2007-09-28 | accessdate =2007-06-14 }}</ref> The first day of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party's]] convention fell on [[Labor Day]], the last day of the popular [[Minnesota State Fair]], though because of [[Hurricane Gustav]], this day was mostly a call for action to help victims and formal, required activities; most of the politicking and partying did not start until Tuesday, the second scheduled day.

This was the latest any major party [[Political convention|convention]] has ever been convened,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gopconvention.com/about/default.aspx | title=About the 2008 Republican National Convention | publisher=2008 Republican National Convention official website | accessdate=2008-12-28 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080730183111/http://www.gopconvention.com/about/default.aspx |archive-date = 2008-07-30}}</ref> and the first one to take place entirely in September. Traditionally, the party who holds the [[White House]] has the opportunity to select the date of its convention second, and normally the challenging party holds their convention in July while the incumbent party holds its convention in August. This year, later dates were chosen for both conventions because the parties wanted to schedule their conventions after the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] ended.

President [[George W. Bush]] did not attend the convention (although he did appear by satellite), in order to oversee relief efforts to help citizens recover from Hurricane Gustav.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/conventions/videos/transcripts/20080902_BUSH_SPEECH.html|title=Transcript - Bush's Address to the Republican National Convention - Election Guide 2008 - The New York Times}}</ref> The attending [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s at the convention nominated Senator [[John McCain]] from Arizona for [[President of the United States|president]] and Governor [[Sarah Palin]] of Alaska for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. 1,191 pledged delegates were necessary for candidates to win the respective nominations.

Four cities made bids to the [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC) for proposals to host the 2008 Convention. Those cities were [[Cleveland]], Ohio, <!-- LEAVE AS MINNEAPOLIS-SAINT PAUL BECAUSE BOTH CITIES WERE INVOLVED IN PROPOSAL --> [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], Minnesota, New York City, New York, and [[Tampa]]-[[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], Florida. The RNC Selection Committee made its recommendation for Minneapolis-Saint Paul and on September 27, 2006, the RNC made its decision public that the 2008 Republican National Convention would be held in Minneapolis-Saint Paul.<ref name=RNCdecide /> The RNC made their decision earlier than originally scheduled because the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) also had Minneapolis-Saint Paul as a finalist among bidding cities. (After the RNC's selection, the DNC removed Minneapolis-Saint Paul from consideration which left the DNC with only two cities to choose from: New York City and Denver, Colorado.) This is the second time the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area held the Republican National Convention—[[1892 Republican National Convention|the first]] was held in 1892.

==Political significance==
The 27 [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] votes from Minnesota, [[Wisconsin]] and [[Iowa]] as a block—equal in value to Florida's—was judged by the University of Minnesota Elections project to be subject to swing toward either major party.<ref>{{cite web| last = Moore| first = Rick| title = 2004 Elections Project - The latest trends in Wisconsin and Iowa| work = UMN News| publisher = Regents of the University of Minnesota| date = 2004-10-26| url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/2004_Elections_Project_The_latest_trends_in_Wisconsin_and_Iowa.html| accessdate = 2006-11-19| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060526182203/http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/2004_Elections_Project_The_latest_trends_in_Wisconsin_and_Iowa.html| archive-date = 2006-05-26| url-status = dead}}</ref> Even so, Minnesota has not gone to the Republicans since [[1972 United States Presidential Election|the 1972 election]] when during his reelection President [[Richard Nixon]] won every state except Massachusetts and the [[District of Columbia]]. In 1984, during his reelection, President [[Ronald Reagan]] was victorious over Minnesota's "[[favorite son]]," [[Walter Mondale]], in all states except Minnesota, and the District of Columbia.

Since the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] limits the president to two terms and vice president Dick Cheney did not seek the presidency, the 2008 election was the first election in which neither the sitting president nor the sitting vice president sought his party's nomination since 1928 (when neither the sitting president, [[Calvin Coolidge]], nor the sitting vice president, [[Charles G. Dawes]], chose to seek the presidency) and the first since 1952 where neither the sitting president nor sitting vice president received his party's nomination (when the sitting president, [[Harry S. Truman]], chose not to seek reelection and the sitting vice president, [[Alben Barkley]], lost the Democratic Nomination to [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]). With the exception of the 1964 convention, which nominated [[Barry Goldwater]] for president and [[William E. Miller]] for vice-president, this was the first convention since 1948 not to feature a man named either Nixon, Dole or Bush on the ticket.

[[Sarah Palin]], nominated for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], became the first female on the Republican presidential ticket.

Considering the signs that were waved by the delegates, the dominant message of the convention was "Country First." The [[U-S-A! cheer|"U.S.A.!"]] chant was also a part of the message of the convention with the delegates chanting it during Lieberman's and Thompson's speeches on the first evening.

==Hurricane Gustav==
Several early predictions made by the [[National Hurricane Center]] showed Minneapolis-St. Paul on the predicted ground track of Hurricane Gustav. Gustav would have long been extra-tropical by the time it reached the area, it could have caused a significant impact to the convention due to rain. Most of the convention's activities were curtailed as Gustav neared, and President Bush canceled his plans to attend the convention. As the hurricane moved inland, its track shifted well to the east missing the area by several hundred miles.

brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights, attorney Steven Reiss from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP in New York, and Albert Goins of Minneapolis.  The federal lawsuit asserted that the government cannot, in the name of security, limit the flow of information by intimidating and arresting journalists who engage in constitutionally protected reporting on speech protected by the First Amendment, such as dissent or law enforcement activities. The settlement included compensation of $100,000 for the three journalists and an agreement by the St. Paul Police Department to implement a training program aimed at educating officers regarding the First Amendment rights of the press and public with respect to police operations — including police handling of media coverage of mass demonstrations — and to pursue implementation of the training program in Minneapolis and statewide.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/03/amy-goodman-settles-lawsuit-2008-republican-national-convention-arrest_n_992431.html|title=Amy Goodman, 'Democracy Now!'

The final protest march was permitted for 2:00 to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. on the final day of the convention. This meant that the last of the marchers needed to be back on capitol grounds by 5&nbsp;p.m. By 4&nbsp;p.m., the march had still not left the capitol grounds. Understanding that the protesters were interested in being near the Xcel Energy Center when delegates were, police offered a compromise: march leaders were told that if they started their march before 5&nbsp;p.m., police would allow it to continue past the permit time. March organizers refused. When the final protest march permit expired at 5&nbsp;p.m., overpasses over Interstate 94 leading into downtown from the state capitol were closed. Two hours later, when the final assembly permit on capitol grounds expired and protesters refused several commands to disperse, police used [[tear gas]], [[smoke bomb]]s, [[pepper spray]], [[Flashbangs|flash bangs]], mounted police, paint marker rounds, and rubber bullets to prevent an antiwar march organized by the [[Anti-War Committee]] to march on the Xcel Energy center. This march would have been in violation of the court-approved march permits.<ref name=Hohmann-20080905>{{cite news|last1=Hohmann |first1=James |title=Police arrest demonstrators, prevent access to Republican convention |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-protests5-2008sep05,0,3520828.story |accessdate=18 December 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=5 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001212956/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-protests5-2008sep05%2C0%2C3520828.story |archive-date=1 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Police arrest 200 in march on GOP convention|url=http://classifieds.dailyherald.com/story/?id=232754&src=152|date=September 5, 2008|publisher=Associated Press via Daily Herald|accessdate=June 26, 2012}}</ref><ref name=AP-20080905 /> Between 300 and 400 people were arrested or held including 19 journalists, among them AP reporters Amy Forliti and Jon Krawczynski,<ref name=AP-20080905 /> reporters from ''Twin Cities Daily Planet'' and ''The Uptake'', and Paul Demko of ''[[Minnesota Independent|The Minnesota Independent]]''.<ref name=AP-20080905>{{cite news|author1=Foley, Ryan J.  |author2=Lohn, Martiga|title=Arrests mark last anti-war march of convention|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-09-05-4174436281_x.htm|date=September 5, 2008|publisher=Associated Press via USA Today|accessdate=June 26, 2012}}</ref><ref name=Turck-20080904>{{cite news|author=Turck, Mary|title=Over 300 arrested at RNC protests, including reporters from the Daily Planet and the Uptake|url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/article/2008/09/04/day-four-protests-arrests.html|date=September 4, 2008|publisher=Twin Cities Daily Planet|accessdate=2008-09-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Demko, Paul|title=If you are on this bridge you are under arrest|url=http://www.minnesotaindependent.com/7691/if-you-are-on-this-bridge-you-are-under-arrest|date=September 5, 2008|publisher=The Minnesota Independent|accessdate=2008-09-05| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080906062219/http://www.minnesotaindependent.com/7691/if-you-are-on-this-bridge-you-are-under-arrest| archive-date= 6 September 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Total arrests of convention protesters numbered approximately 800, although only 15 cases resulted in criminal charges.<ref name=Demko /> Several suits were started in U.S. District Court, claiming civil rights abuses by the [[St. Paul Police Department]] and other agencies involved in the RNC, particularly the [[Minneapolis Police Department]] and [[Ramsey County Sheriff's Office]].<ref name=Demko>{{cite news|author=Demko, Paul|title=Lawsuits filed alleging police misconduct around the RNC|url=http://minnesotaindependent.com/27788/lawsuits-filed-alleging-police-misconduct-around-rnc|date=February 27, 2009|publisher=The Minnesota Independent|accessdate=2009-02-28| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090301013054/http://minnesotaindependent.com/27788/lawsuits-filed-alleging-police-misconduct-around-rnc| archive-date= 1 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Search warrants were still being granted into 2009 in relation to the events that transpired during the 2008 RNC.<ref name="March 5th 2009 Raid">{{cite news |author=Anonymous, Anonymous |title=Macalester Dorm Raided in February in Hunt for RNC Evidence |url=http://tc.indymedia.org/2009/mar/macalester-dorm-raided-february-hunt-rnc-evidence |date=March 5, 2009 |publisher=Twin Cities IndyMedia |accessdate=2009-03-05 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5h7IkP4co?url=http://tc.indymedia.org/2009/mar/macalester-dorm-raided-february-hunt-rnc-evidence |archive-date=2009-05-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Post-RNC convictions of protesters===
* [[Bradley Neal Crowder]] of [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], [[Texas]], pleaded guilty in federal court on January 8, 2009, to one charge of possessing an unregistered firearm (as [[Molotov cocktail]]s are defined under federal law) in return for prosecutors dropping two other firearm charges. Each of the three charges carried a maximum of 10 years in prison. He is still awaiting sentencing to between 30 and 46 months in prison depending on whether U.S. Chief Judge Michael J. Davis decides that he played a minor or major role in the crime. Crowder has been in jail since his September 1, 2008, arrest for disorderly conduct.
* [[David McKay (activist)|David Guy McKay]], also of Midland, Texas, was initially released on bail on February 2, 2009, after his first trial ended in a [[hung jury]]. The case never went to retrial as on March 17, McKay accepted a plea deal and plead guilty to three federal felonies: possession of an unregistered firearm (Molotov cocktails), illegal manufacture of a firearm, and possession of a firearm with no serial number, in return for the government not seeking four additional sentencing points for "intent to use" the [[Molotov cocktails]].
