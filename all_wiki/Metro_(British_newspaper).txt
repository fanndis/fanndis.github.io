The '''''Metro''''' is the United Kingdom's highest-circulation print newspaper. It is published in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid format]] by [[DMG Media]].<ref name="The Economist">{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21739201-metro-studiously-apolitical-commuter-freesheet-now-has-highest-circulation-sun |title=The Sun is toppled as Britain's biggest newspaper |date=22 March 2018 |work=[[The Economist]] |location=London}}</ref> The [[free newspaper]] is distributed from Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays and the period between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day inclusive) mornings on trains and buses, and at railway/Underground stations, airports and hospitals across selected urban areas of England, Wales and Scotland. Copies are also handed out to pedestrians.

''Metro'' is owned by [[Daily Mail and General Trust]] plc (DMGT), part of the same media group as the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'', but in some areas ''Metro'' operates as a [[Franchising|franchise]] with a local newspaper publisher, rather than as a wholly owned concern. While being a sister paper to the [[Conservatism|conservative]] ''Daily Mail'', the newspaper has never endorsed any political party or candidate, and claims to take a neutral political stance in its reporting.<ref name="pressgazette.co.uk">[http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/who-says-millennials-dont-read-newspapers-editor-ted-young-on-the-rise-and-rise-of-metro/ Who says millennials don't read newspapers?] ''[[Press Gazette]]'' 24 March 2017</ref><ref name="The Economist" />

==History==
[[File:Metro, The Free Newspaper delivery van - geograph.org.uk - 1248193.jpg|thumb|A ''Metro'' delivery van]]

===Origins and London launch ===
The ''Metro'' free newspaper concept originated in Sweden, where a publication of the same name was launched in 1995 by [[Metro International]]. British newspaper executives Jonathan Harmsworth and Murdoch MacLennan, from [[DMGT]], were reportedly inspired by the idea and flew to Stockholm on a 'fact-finding mission' with a view to developing their own version.<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/08/metro-freesheets-dmgt-news-intrernational |title=Ten years on, and Metro has turned London into free-for-all |date=8 March 2009 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref> There were also reports in the late 1990s that both Metro International and [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News International]] were considering launching free newspapers in the UK that might prove a commercial threat to DMGT's businesses.<ref name="Metro at ten">{{cite news |url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/metro-ten/888333 |title=Metro at ten |date=6 March 2009 |work=Campaign Magazine |location=London}}</ref>

DMGT subsequently launched ''Metro'', using the same name as Metro International's publications but with a different logo on Tuesday 16 March 1999. This UK version of ''Metro'' had no relation to Metro International or its sister newspapers in other countries. ''Metro'' was launched initially as a London-only newspaper with an original print run of 85,000 copies, which were distributed via dedicated bins in London Underground stations.<ref name="The Guardian"/> The newspaper was produced at DMGT's printworks and office complex at [[Surrey Quays]] in southeast London, away from the company's main newspaper office in [[Kensington]], west London.<ref name="Metro at ten"/>

===National expansion=== 
In the years following its launch, the paper's distribution was gradually expanded to other major UK cities, including Manchester and Birmingham. By February 2003, ''Metro'' had become operationally profitable for the first time.<ref name="Metro at ten"/> Its reach was extended further in 2004, becoming available in more urban areas, including Nottingham, Bristol and Bath.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/3741591.stm |title=Metro newspaper moves into city |date=24 May 2004 |publisher=BBC News |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/3763195.stm |title=Metro newspaper comes to the West |date=31 May 2004 |publisher=BBC News |location=London}}</ref>

''Metro''{{'}}s circulation continued to rise in the following years, although readership temporarily dipped after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]]. There was a 1.8% decline - the equivalent of around 9,000 readers - in copies picked up in the weeks following the attacks due to a reduction in the number of people using London's public transport network, coupled with the temporary closure of some [[London Underground]] lines where ''Metro'' was distributed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/aug/12/pressandpublishing.circulationfigures2|title=Metro hit as commuters avoid London Underground|date=12 August 2005|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref>

Following several years of national expansion, in 2006 the newspaper's production was moved to DMGT's main newspaper offices at [[Northcliffe House]] in Kensington, west London.<ref name="Metro at ten"/> That same year the newspaper expanded further, launching in [[Cardiff]] and [[Liverpool]] in joint venture deals with [[Trinity Mirror]].<ref name="Metro at ten"/>

At the time of its tenth anniversary in 2009, the newspaper was distributed in sixteen "major" UK cities and its circulation had grown to 1.3 million.<ref>{{cite news |last=Luft |first=Oliver |date=16 March 2009 |title=Metro newspaper celebrates 10 years of publication |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/16/metro-newspaper-10-years-anniversary |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=15 May 2015}}</ref> Despite the increase in readership, that same year management also closed five regional ''Metro'' offices in Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle, Birmingham and Bristol, which were responsible for producing regionalised arts, entertainment and food pages, citing "challenging economic conditions".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/28/metro-rehional-offices |title=Metro to shut regional editorial offices |date=28 August 2009 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref>

By 2011, ''Metro''{{'}}s distribution network had expanded to more than 50 cities in the UK. That year media commentator [[Roy Greenslade]] said the publication was now making "bumper profits" and dubbed it "Britain's most successful national newspaper".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/jan/26/metro-national-newspapers|title=Profitable Metro can't stop making money, but we still need 'proper' newspapers|date=26 January 2011|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref>

===Launch of Irish edition===
''Metro Ireland'' was launched in Dublin on 10 October 2005. It followed a legal battle over the title's name with the publishers of the ''Irish Independent'' and Dublin's ''Evening Herald'', which launched its own free newspaper called ''Herald AM''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cozens |first=Claire |date=10 October 2005 |title=Battle commences over Dublin freesheets |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/oct/10/independentnewsmedia.associatednewspapers |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=10 October 2005}}</ref> Both titles were loss-making, despite having a combined circulation of 145,000 in the [[Greater Dublin Area]]. On 2 July 2009, it was announced that the two freesheets would merge under the ''Metro'' banner,<ref>{{cite news |last=Luft |first=Oliver |date=2 July 2009 |title=Rival Dublin freesheets Herald AM and Metro Ireland to merge |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/02/herald-am-and-metro-ireland-merge |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=22 January 2011}}</ref> an operation completed by 2010.<ref>[http://www.metroherald.ie/howitallstarted.html Metro Herald<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919051917/http://www.metroherald.ie/howitallstarted.html |date=19 September 2011}}</ref> However, the Irish edition was closed down in December 2014.

===London 2012 Olympic Games===
For the first time in its history, ''Metro'' temporarily published seven days a week during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]], providing free copies to spectators at the Games as well as the general public.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19253278|title=London Olympics give boost to media|date=14 August 2012|work=BBC News|location=London}}</ref> The newspaper struck a reported £2.25 million deal with sportswear manufacturer [[Adidas]] to run cover wrap adverts on each of the 17 days of the Olympics.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/26/adidas-deal-metro-london-olympics|title=Adidas in £2.25m deal to run Metro cover wraps during London Olympics|date=26 July 2012|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref>

===Rising circulation===
After more than a decade in charge, editor Kenny Campbell was replaced as editor by [[Ted Young (journalist)|Ted Young]] in 2014. Young's appointment coincided with a number of changes at the newspaper, including the separation of the print and online editions, along with an expansion of ''Metro'''s distribution in the UK.<ref name=Guardian_2015>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/18/ted-young-editor-metro-print-richard-desmond|title=Metro's Ted Young: 'Our job is as an anchor, telling the basic story'|date=18 October 2015|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref>

In November 2016, comedian [[Richard Herring]] stepped down from writing his weekly column for ''Metro''. Fellow TV comedian [[Dom Joly]] later replaced him in the slot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.richardherring.com/journalism/10875/metro_242_final_column.html|title=Metro 242 - FINAL COLUMN|website=richardherring.com}}</ref>

In 2017, ''Metro'' became the most-read newspaper in the UK, according to monthly [[National Readership Survey]] figures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/5f5b781e-0340-11e7-ace0-1ce02ef0def9|title=Metro becomes UK's most-read daily newspaper|date=7 March 2017|website=Financial Times}}</ref> In March 2018 ''Metro'' officially overtook ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' in total print circulation, according to ABC ([[Audit Bureau of Circulations (UK)]]) figures.<ref name="The Economist"/>

==Content==
===Print edition===
The majority of the newspaper's content is produced at [[Northcliffe House]] in [[Kensington]], west London. There are no regional editions within England and Wales, except for occasional differences in sports and arts content catered to specific local audiences. A separate, small team produces a Scottish edition of ''Metro''; however, often the only substantial difference between the two versions is the front page.

The newspaper is divided into three main sections—news, features and sport. The news section includes ''Guilty Pleasures'', which typically contains two or four pages of showbiz and entertainment news, a letters page, and a page dedicated for business news. A popular feature of the letters page is Rush Hour Crush, in which readers send in anonymous messages to fellow users of public transport who they consider attractive. The daily column has led to at least one marriage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://metro.co.uk/2013/04/19/metros-rush-hour-crush-sparks-marriage-proposal-3653882/ |title=Metro's Rush-Hour Crush sparks marriage proposal |website=www.metro.co.uk |access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref> The news section also features occasional feature columns from political pundits such as [[Sophy Ridge]] of [[Sky News]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/SophyRidgeSky/status/1004840056325099522 |title=Sophy Ridge – Twitter |website=www.twitter.com |access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref> However, while offering analysis, these columns do not typically express endorsements of political positions or candidates, thus not being considered as op-ed columns as in other newspapers.

The features section contains a mix of articles on travel, homes, style, and health, science, as well as arts coverage and entertainment listings. The puzzles page currently features a crossword and [[Sudoku]].

===Online===
Metro launched a website version of the newspaper in July 2001.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2001/07/17/metro-co-uk-britains-first-urban-national-newspaper-goes-online-239870/|title=Britain's first urban national newspaper goes online|last=Reporter|first=Metro|date=17 July 2001|work=Metro.co.uk|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Between 2001 and 2014 most print edition articles were published on this website, along with additional online-only content such as blogs and opinion columns.

In 2014 production of the newspaper and the website were separated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/05/metro-website-mail-online|title=Metro website to be folded into Mail Online|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=5 March 2014|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> As a result, ''Metro'' newspaper and ''Metro Online'' are now produced by separate organisations and written independently by different editorial teams, while remaining part of the same parent company.

The newspaper's content is now published online on a separate website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metro.news/|title=Metro Newspaper UK|website=Metro Newspaper UK|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
In the run-up to the [[2015 United Kingdom general election]], the-then [[UK Independence Party]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] refused to be interviewed by ''Metro'' after accusing the newspaper of being biased against his party. This was denied by the newspaper's editor. All other national party leaders agreed to be interviewed, including Conservative prime minister [[David Cameron]] and Labour leader [[Ed Miliband]].<ref name="Guardian_2015"/>

Prior to the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], ''Metro'' published a front-page cover-wrap advert on behalf of the Leave campaign, paid for by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]]. The following day the newspaper published another cover-wrap advert, this time from the Remain campaign. Editor [[Ted Young (journalist)|Ted Young]] said both adverts, which each cost more than £250,000 to place, generated around 300 complaints each, accusing the newspaper of both pro and anti Brexit bias.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/who-says-millennials-dont-read-newspapers-editor-ted-young-on-the-rise-and-rise-of-metro/|title=Who says millennials don't read newspapers?|date=24 March 2017|work=Press Gazette|location=London}}</ref> Questions were subsequently raised as to why the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] placed an advert in ''Metro'', because the newspaper does not publish in Northern Ireland.<ref name=Guardian_2017>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/24/eu-referendum-spending-official-campaigns-investigation-opens-electoral-commission|title=DUP spent £282,000 on Brexit ad that did not run in Northern Ireland |date=24 February 2017|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref>

In May 2019, the paper was condemned by the [[National Union of Journalists]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/misleading-dwp-newspaper-ads/|title=NUJ concerned by misleading DWP newspaper ads|date=22 May 2019|work=nuj.org.uk}}</ref> and the [[Public and Commercial Services Union]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/universal-credit-union-blasts-dwp-16048059|title=Universal Credit union blasts DWP 'propaganda' as staff announce two-day strike|date=16 May 2019|work=The Mirror|location=London}}</ref> after an internal document leaked to ''[[The Guardian]]'' showed evidence that [[Amber Rudd]], [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]], had authorised the use of at least a quarter of a million pounds of public money for a ten-week run of advertorials to be placed in ''Metro'' newspapers to "challenge the myths" around the government's controversial [[Universal Credit]] programme.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/14/universal-credit-department-work-pensions-pr?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other|title=Coming soon: the great universal credit deception|date=14 May 2019|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref> [[The Trussell Trust]] also ran a countercampaign called "Universal Credit Uncovered".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.trusselltrust.org/2019/05/23/universal-credits-failings-cant-be-glossed-over-with-ad-campaign|title=Universal Credit failings can't be glossed over with ad campaign|date=23 May 2019}}</ref> In June 2019, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/dwp-80-charities-file-watchdog-16537228|title=DWP:80 charities file watchdog complaint over 'misleading' Universal Credit adverts|date=19 June 2019|work=The Mirror|location=London}}</ref> reported that 80 UK charities had filed a complaint to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] over "misleading Universal Credit adverts in ''Metro''". In July 2019, the Advertising Standards Authority announced it was launching an investigation into the DWP ads.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-advertising-watchdog-launches-investigation-17478414|title=DWP: Advertising watchdog launches investigation into Universal Credit adverts|date=5 July 2019|work=The Mirror|location=London}}</ref> The move came after the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]'' revealed that the ''Metro'' had not run the controversial ads in its 3 July 2019 print edition.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/b/disabled-campaigners-vigilant-against-metro|title=Activists call for Metro apology over universal credit adverts|date=4 July 2019|work=Morning Star}}</ref> On 5 November 2019, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the campaign was misleading, branding the ads "exaggerated" and in some cases "unsubstantiated".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/dwps-225000-universal-credit-spin-20816528|title=DWP's £225,000 Universal Credit spin campaign ruled misleading by watchdog|date=5 November 2019|work=The Mirror|location=London}}</ref> The Advertising Standards Authority upheld three complaint points whilst partially upholding a fourth.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/ruling-on-dwps-misleading-universal-credit-ads-is-vindication-for-direct-action|title=Ruling on DWP's misleading universal credit ads 'is vindication for direct action|date=7 November 2019|work=Disability News Service}}</ref>

== Competition ==
''Metro'' has faced competition in parts of the UK from other free newspapers, along with rivalry from paid-for national titles. Current editor [[Ted Young (journalist)|Ted Young]] has said his 'mantra' is to produce a newspaper that its readers would be willing to pay for.<ref name="pressgazette.co.uk"/>

[[Metro International]] attempted to launch its own UK edition in 1999, being distributed in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]'s [[Tyne & Wear Metro]] system competing with [[DMGT]]'s ''Metro''. After battling alongside each other with the same name, Metro International's ''Metro'' changed its name to ''Morning News''. This attempt was short-lived however, and ''Morning News'' was discontinued shortly afterwards.<ref>[http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,7495,929049,00.html Desmond in Swedish talks over London freesheet] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 3 April 2003</ref>

In 2005 [[Rupert Murdoch]] said he was worried by competition from ''Metro'' and that it had damaged the circulation of his own newspaper ''The Sun''. He told a press conference he was watching the free newspaper market "keenly and apprehensively".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/feb/02/rupertmurdoch.pressandpublishing|title=Murdoch: Metro has hit the Sun|date=2 February 2005|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref> Murdoch's [[News International]] subsequently launched a London-based evening freesheet in 2006 called ''[[The London Paper]]''. This was closed on 18 September 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/20/the-london-paper-close-plan|title=The London Paper set to close|date=20 August 2009|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref>

''[[London Lite]]'' was another free, evening newspaper published in central London only from 2006 to 2009, at the time owned by the same parent company as ''Metro'', and was seen as a 'spoiler' to protect against the commercial threat from ''The London Paper''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2009/oct/27/london-lite-closure-newspaper-market|title=After London Lite's inevitable closure, what next for capital's newspapers?|date=27 October 2009|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref>

Another rival is the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', which became a freesheet in 2009, although unlike ''Metro'' it is only published in the London region.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/02/london-evening-standard-free|title=London Evening Standard to go free|date=2 October 2009|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref>

== App products ''11versus11'' and ''Guilty Pleasures'' ==
Metro launched two new mobile app products in 2016: 11versus11, which is a football news app, and Guilty Pleasures, a celebrity news app. Both apps offer personalised content based on a user's interest profile.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/metro-launches-personalised-football-mobile-news-app-11versus11/|title=Metro launches personalised football mobile news app 11versus11 – Press Gazette|website=www.pressgazette.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> 11versus11 won the Best Lifestyle, Sports & Entertainment App award at the 2017 European Digital Media Awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dmgt.com/news-and-media/news-articles/2017/11versus11-scoops-european-digital-media-award|title=11versus11 scoops European Digital Media Award|website=www.dmgt.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref>
