'''''Will & Grace''''' is an American [[situation comedy|sitcom]] television series created by [[Max Mutchnick]] and [[David Kohan]]. Set in [[LGBT culture in New York City|New York City]], the show focuses on the friendship between best friends [[Will Truman]] ([[Eric McCormack]]), a [[gay]] lawyer, and [[Grace Adler]] ([[Debra Messing]]), a straight interior designer. The show was broadcast on [[NBC]] from September 21, 1998, to May 18, 2006, for a total of eight seasons, and returned to NBC on September 28, 2017 and ended on April 23, 2020. ''Will & Grace'' has been one of the most successful television series with gay principal characters.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Evan|title=DECODING WILL AND GRACE: MASS AUDIENCE RECEPTION OF A POPULAR NETWORK SITUATION COMEDY|url=http://www.csub.edu/~rdugan2/SOC%20577%20Pop%20Culture/decoding%20will%20and%20grace.pdf|website=www.csub.edu|publisher=California State University, November 4, 2003. Abstract: The television situation comedy Will and Grace is notable as the first successful network prime-time series to feature gay characters in a gay milieu. The show's considerable popularity begs the question of how the show's gay sensibility and humor, particularly the gay trickster character, Jack, is received by a heterosexual audience. This article discusses the notion of gay humor, considers the show's history, analyzes several episodes, and scrutinizes the responses of 136 college students who watched the show. Viewers do not identify with Jack and regard him as the most frequent butt of humor on the show, but they also consider him the funniest character and, by a very slight margin, their favorite. Contrary to my original hypotheses, respondent characterizations of Jack tend to reflect appreciation for all aspects of his trickster personality, though his ostentatious sexuality tends to be ignored.|accessdate=December 13, 2015}}</ref>

Despite initial criticism for its stereotypical portrayal of [[gay]] characters, it went on to become a staple of NBC's [[Must See TV]] Thursday night lineup and was met with continued critical acclaim. It was ensconced in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] top 20 for half of its 1998–2006 network run. The show was the highest-rated sitcom among adults 18–49 from 2001 to 2005. ''Will & Grace'' earned 18 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and 83 nominations. Each main actor received an Emmy Award throughout the series. In 2014 the [[Writers Guild of America]] placed the sitcom at number 94 in their list of the 101 best-written TV series of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/06/wgas-101-best-written-tv-series-of-all-time-complete-list/|title='101 Best Written TV Series Of All Time' From WGA/TV Guide: Complete List|first=The Deadline|last=Team|date=June 3, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> Since the final episode of the 1998–2006 run aired, the sitcom has been credited with helping and improving public opinion of the [[LGBT community]], with former U.S. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] commenting that the show "probably did more to educate the American public" on LGBT issues "than almost anything anybody has ever done so far".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/may/6/biden-will-grace-educated-public-about-gays/|title=Biden 'comfortable' with gay marriage, cites 'Will & Grace' |work=The Washington Times |accessdate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> In 2014, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] added an [[LGBT history in the United States|LGBT history]] collection to their museum which included items from ''Will & Grace''.

==Cast and characters==
{{Main|List of Will & Grace characters}}

===Main===
[[File:Eric McCormack, Debra Messing.jpg|upright|thumb|Eric McCormack and Debra Messing in 1999]]
[[File:Sean Hayes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|Hayes in 2010]]
* [[Eric McCormack]] as [[Will Truman]]: The first titular protagonist in the show, Will is a [[Homosexuality|gay]] man who is a successful [[corporate lawyer]] who studied at [[Columbia University]], where he met Grace as a freshman; they have been best friends ever since. He is very precise and [[Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder|obsessive]] when it comes to certain tasks, especially cleaning, dressing, and decorating. However, Will does have a very patient and compassionate nature towards those close to him, often to a fault. Even though Will is gay, he sometimes tries to pass as straight; he has at times avoided admitting his sexual orientation to people. Several characters commented that his relationship with Grace is more like that of a married couple than two friends; at one point Will even considered having a baby with Grace.
* [[Debra Messing]] as [[Grace Adler]]: The other titular protagonist in the show, Grace is a [[Heterosexuality|straight]] [[Interior design|interior decorator]] with a fondness for food and a sometimes selfish attitude. She has been Will's best friend since college and roommate throughout most of the show. Grace is [[Judaism|Jewish]] but does not practice her religion staunchly. She plays as a [[Neuroticism|neurotic]] counterbalance for Will's more [[everyman]] character. Grace tends to rely heavily on Will for moral and emotional support, especially after a break-up.
* [[Megan Mullally]] as [[Karen Walker (Will & Grace)|Karen Walker]]: Karen "works" as Grace's assistant, making "Grace Adler Designs" popular among her socialite acquaintances. She is married to the [[wealth]]y (but mostly unseen) Stanley Walker. Karen is also known for [[Alcohol abuse|casually downing alcohol]] and prescription medication and has a venomous personality. However, she is very close to Jack, adores Grace, and throughout the show's run, warms up to Will. Even though she seems to be devoid of manners and social graces, Karen has shown bouts of intelligence: having a working knowledge of business/real estate market economics, a moderate understanding of computers, and a flair for interior design. She is also a certified [[Notary public|public notary]] and an aficionado of various liquors and prescription drugs. Despite this, she is often unaware of her rudeness and thoughtless conduct toward the [[Working class|working]] and [[middle class]]es, often criticizing and mocking what she fails to understand.
* [[Sean Hayes]] as [[Jack McFarland]]: Will's close friend since college. Jack is flamboyantly gay, confident, and free-spirited, having been so from a young age. He drifts from man to man and changes occupations often, being very fickle when it comes to both. He has worked as a struggling actor, an acting instructor, a back-up dancer for [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Janet Jackson]], a sales associate at [[Banana Republic]] and [[Barneys New York]], a cater-waiter, a student nurse, Junior VP for Out TV, and host of his own Out TV [[talk show]], called ''Jack Talk''. Jack made four one-man shows (called ''Just Jack'', ''Jack 2000'', ''Jack 2001'', and ''Jack 2002'') to showcase his singing/dancing/acting abilities; all attempts having only marginal success. Early on in the show he establishes a close friendship with Karen; the pair often spend time together and orchestrate various pranks. Throughout the series, Jack relies on Will and Karen for financial support, but on the finale of the original series, he inherits Beverley Leslie's money and becomes very rich. His idol is [[Cher]].
* [[Shelley Morrison]] as [[Rosario Salazar]] (recurring seasons 1–2; regular seasons 3–8): Karen's maid, and later Jack's wife, then ex-wife. Morrison was invited to reprise her role when the series was revived, but declined, having retired from acting.

Creators of ''Will & Grace'' and real-life friends [[Max Mutchnick]] and [[David Kohan]] modeled the show after Mutchnick's relationship with childhood friend Janet Eisenberg, a [[New York City]] voice-over casting agent. Mutchnick, who is gay, met Eisenberg while rehearsing a play at [[Temple Emanuel (Beverly Hills, California)|Temple Emanuel]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]], at age of 13.<ref name="jewjournal">{{cite web|first=Naomi|last=Pfefferman|title=Jewish and Normal? Oy!|work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]]|publisher=Rap-Up.com|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/television/article/jewish_and_normal_oy_20010907|accessdate=November 14, 2012|date=December 1, 2001}}</ref> He was the main star of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[school musical]], while she was a student in the drama department. About three years later, she introduced him to Kohan, the son of comedy writer [[Alan Kohan]], in the drama department at [[Beverly Hills High School]]. "Max and Janet seemed to have a lovely rapport, but the romantic element confused me, and it confused them as well," Kohan later recalled. "They went out for a couple of years, then they went off to different colleges. And Max [[Coming out|comes out of the closet]], springs it on her—and she was stunned. It was a shocking revelation for her, so I kind of functioned as a liaison between the two of them, because they both still really loved each other."<ref name="jewjournal"/>

While Kohan practiced his [[shuttle diplomacy]], he and Mutchnick began developing sitcom ideas, which prompted the pair to start writing as a duo.<ref name="jewjournal"/> They eventually landed staff jobs on [[HBO]]'s adult-themed sitcom ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]'' and executive produced the short-lived NBC sitcom ''[[Boston Common (TV series)|Boston Common]]''.<ref name="jewjournal"/> In 1997, they developed an ensemble comedy about six friends, two of them based on Mutchnick and Eisenberg.<ref name="jewjournal"/> At the same time, [[Warren Littlefield]], the then-president of [[NBC]] Entertainment, was seeking another relationship comedy for the network as ''[[Mad About You]]'' was going off the air.<ref name="DVD">{{cite video | people=|date=2006|title=Will & Grace: Series Finale – The Last Words: Interviews with the Cast|medium=DVD|publisher=Lions Gate Entertainment}}</ref><ref name="insidetheactors">{{cite web|title=The Cast of Will & Grace|work=[[Inside the Actors Studio]]|publisher=[[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX5QTGq3z5U |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref> When Kohan and Mutchnick pitched their idea, which centered on three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman, Littlefield was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted to learn more about the gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan were sent to create a pilot script centering on those two characters.<ref name="insidetheactors"/> While Kohan and Mutchnick elaborated on the pilot script, they spent four tense months faxing Littlefield the box office grosses from hit films with gay characters such as ''[[The Birdcage]]'' and ''[[My Best Friend's Wedding]]''.<ref name="jewjournal"/>

NBC was positive about the project, but there was still some concern that the homosexual subject matter would cause alarm. [[Ellen DeGeneres]]'s sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], was canceled the year before ''Will & Grace'' premiered because ratings had plummeted after the show became "too gay."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/7230/will-grace-season-one/|title=Will & Grace – Season One|last=Blair|first=David|date=August 13, 2003 |publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=April 22, 2009}}</ref><ref name="pink">{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,270675,00.html |title=In The Pink|date=September 10, 1999|work=Entertainment Weekly|page=1|accessdate=April 22, 2009}}</ref> Despite the criticism ABC received for DeGeneres's [[coming out]] episode, "[[The Puppy Episode]]," Kohan said, "there's no question that show made it easier for ''Will & Grace'' to make it on the air." He added: "''Will & Grace'' had a better shot at succeeding where ''Ellen'' failed, however, because Will has known about his homosexuality for 20 years. He's not exploring that awkward territory for the first time, as Ellen did.

NBC went to sitcom director [[James Burrows]] to see what he thought of the homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show.<ref name="DVD 2"/> Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, "I knew that the boys had captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before."<ref name="DVD" /> The filming of the pilot began on March 15, 1998. The actors behind Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last long on television. McCormack said: "When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I were sitting on the couch and looking at each other and I said, 'We're gonna be on this set for a while.' And we sort of clasped hands, but we didn't want to say anything beyond that and jinx it."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/mccormack-looks-end-will-grace-wbna9053810 |title=McCormack looks to end of 'Will & Grace' |date=August 23, 2005|publisher=Today.com |accessdate=May 24, 2009}}</ref>

==Lawsuit==
In December 2003, in the midst of the series' sixth season, executive producers and creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick sued NBC and NBC Studios. Alleging that the network sold the rights to the series in an attempt to keep profits within the NBC family, Kohan and Mutchnick felt that they were cheated out of considerable profits because the network did not shop the show to the highest bidder. Another allegation against the network was that during the first four seasons of the series, the studio licensed the rights for amounts that were insufficient for covering production costs, thus leading to extraordinarily large production deficits.<ref name="Producers of 'Will & Grace' sue NBC">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-12-12-will-grace_x.htm|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|title=Producers of 'Will & Grace' sue NBC| date=December 16, 2003 | accessdate=March 22, 2008 | quote=The men, who created the show and wrote many of its episodes, accuse the two companies of failing to shop the show to the highest bidder, colluding instead to keep profits within the NBC family. General Electric owns both companies.}}</ref> Three months later, NBC filed a countersuit against Kohan and Mutchnick stating that the co-creators were expected to act as an independent third party in the negotiations between NBC and its subsidiary, NBC Studios (since subsumed into [[Universal Television]]).<ref name="NBC sues 'Will & Grace' creators">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-05-will-grace-suit_x.htm|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|title=NBC sues 'Will & Grace' creators| date=March 5, 2004 | accessdate=March 22, 2008}}</ref>

With a pending lawsuit and production beginning on other projects, Kohan and Mutchnick were absent on the ''Will & Grace'' set for most of its final seasons. They wrote the season 4 episode, "A Buncha White Chicks Sittin' Around Talkin'" and did not return to the writers' seat until the series finale four years later. Three years after NBC's countersuit and one year after the series ended, the legal battle between NBC and Kohan and Mutchnick ended in 2007 when all parties agreed on a settlement, with the series creators being awarded $49 million, of their original $65 million lawsuit.<ref name="Surprise settlement in 'Grace' case">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ia76075fe469ef9a445bf8a470ba6059d |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |title=Surprise settlement in 'Grace' case |date=April 27, 2007 |accessdate=March 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915212437/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ia76075fe469ef9a445bf8a470ba6059d |archivedate=September 15, 2007 }}</ref>

==Syndication==
''Will & Grace'' entered off-network syndication in 2002. In 2002 [[WGN America]] acquired the cable rights to air the series, where it aired until 2005 when [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]] acquired the cable rights to air the series. After eight years and the expiration of Lifetime's contract, the rights to the series were picked up by [[We TV|WeTV]] and [[Logo TV]] in 2013, with both eventually letting the rights lapse.

The streaming service [[Hulu]] later picked up the show, in anticipation of the show's revival in 2017, with the entire series also carried on NBC.com. Around the same time, NBC's classic subchannel network [[Cozi TV]] picked up the series and airs it four times nightly, and promotes it as "The Original Series" to avert confusion with the current-day run.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cozitv.com/shows/Cozi-Will--Grace-447739643.html|title=Will & Grace|first=COZI|last=TV|publisher=}}</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom]], the series was aired on [[Channel 4]] up until its season finale in 2006. It was confirmed on December 4, 2017 that the series would premiere in January 2018 on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]. The tenth season was not broadcast and instead went straight to a DVD release on August 5, 2019.

In Ireland, the series first aired on [[TV3 Ireland]] until its conclusion in 2006. It was confirmed in January 2018 rival channel [[RTÉ2]] picked up the broadcasting rights for the 2017–18 season run, beginning in February 2018.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The show has been criticized for not fully challenging stereotypes. "Battles and Hilton-Morrow (2002) analyse ''Will & Grace'' with regard to its dependence on traditional sitcom formulas and argue that the narratives diminish any of the show’s potentially subversive themes...Kanner (2003) notes that the gayness of ''Will & Grace'' is normalized because the driving force of the show is their heterosexual friendship. Will’s sexuality is assumed and incorporated into the show mostly as comic source and rarely as driving narrative."<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Guillermo|last=Avila-Saavedra|title=Nothing queer about queer television: televized construction of gay masculinities|journal=Media, Culture & Society|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|location=Thousand Oaks, California|date=January 1, 2009|volume=31|issue=5|pages=5–21}}</ref>

The show garnered a fair amount of criticism and negative reviews upon its debut in 1998, most of which compared the show to the recently canceled [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''. One such review said, "If ''Will & Grace'' can somehow survive a brutal time period opposite [[American football|football]] and ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', it could grow into a reasonably entertaining little anomaly—that is, a series about a man and a woman who have no sexual interest in one another. But don't bet on it.

The series finale was heavily promoted by NBC, and McCormack, Messing, Mullally and Hayes appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' to bid farewell, on May 10 and 18, respectively. NBC devoted a two-hour block in its primetime schedule on May 18, 2006, for the ''Will & Grace'' send-off. An hour-long series retrospective, "Say Goodnight, Gracie", featuring interviews with the cast, crew, and guest stars, preceded the hour-long series finale. Series creators and executive producers Kohan and Mutchnick, who had not served as writers since the season 4 finale, penned the script for "The Finale". Regarding the finale, Mutchnick stated, "We wrote about what you want to have happen with people you love... All the things that matter in life, they end up having."<ref>{{cite news | last = Keveney| first = Bill| title = NBC's 'Will' bows out gracefully | work = [[USA Today]] | url =https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-05-17-will-grace-retrospective_x.htm |date=May 17, 2006 |accessdate=March 22, 2008}}</ref>

The ninth season was met with generally positive reviews. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the season has a rating of 86% based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Will & Grace'' reunites its ever-hilarious cast for a revival season that picks up right where the show left off 11 years ago—adding a fresh relevance and a series of stories that make sharply funny use of the passage of time."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/will_grace/s09/|title=Will & Grace: Season 9 (2017) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|location=San Francisco, California|accessdate=September 29, 2017}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the season has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/will-grace-2017 |title=Will & Grace reviews |website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|location=San Francisco, California|accessdate=September 29, 2017}}</ref>

===Awards and nominations===
{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Will & Grace}}
[[File:Megan Mullally by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Megan Mullally]] received two Primetime Emmy Awards for her portrayal of Karen]]
''Will & Grace'' has been nominated for 83 [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], winning 18 of them, including once for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2000. McCormack, Messing, Hayes, and Mullally each won at least one Emmy Award for their respective performances, becoming one of four live-action sitcoms, along with ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and ''[[Schitt's Creek]]'', where all the principal actors have won at least one Emmy Award. Mullally also won a second time for her performance in 2006, a year when ''Will & Grace'' was nominated for 10 Emmys for its final season. The year before, the show had garnered 15 nominations, tied with ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as the series receiving the most nominations. This was almost an all-time record; the two shows were second behind ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', with 16 nominations in 1996.

With three each, both Hayes and Mullally held the record of winning the most [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s for the categories Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy Series and Best Performance by an Actress in a Comedy Series, respectively, for their roles in ''Will & Grace''; however, [[Tina Fey]] went on to tie with Mullally and [[Alec Baldwin]] went on to surpass Hayes, both for their roles on the series ''[[30 Rock]]''. ''Will & Grace'' has won several [[GLAAD Media Awards]] for its advocacy of the [[gay community]]. Despite more than two dozen nominations, ''Will & Grace'' never won a [[Golden Globe Award]] during its original run.

===Ratings===
The show debuted on Mondays beginning on September 21, 1998, and steadily gained in popularity, culminating when it moved to Thursday night as part of NBC's [[Must See TV]] line-up. The show ultimately became a [[Nielsen ratings|highly rated]] television show in the United States, earning a top-twenty rating during four of its eight seasons, including one season at # 9. From 2001 to 2005, ''Will & Grace'' was the highest-rated sitcom among adults 18–49. However, when the show lost ''[[Friends]]'' as its lead-in after the [[2003–04 United States network television schedule|2003–04 season]], ''Will & Grace'' began shedding viewers and slipped out of the top 20 during its last two seasons.

"[[The Finale (Will & Grace)|The Finale]]" drew over 18 million viewers,<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = 'Will & Grace' Helps NBC Stay Tough on Thursday | publisher = Zap2It | url =http://www.zap2it.com/tv/ratings/zap-ratings051806,0,2450059.story

While the season eight finale is considered a ratings success, it is far from being the most watched episode of ''Will & Grace''—that accolade remains with the season four episode "[[A Chorus Lie]]", which aired on February 7, 2002, and ranked #8 for the week. When the show was at the height of its popularity (seasons 3–5), ranking in the Top 10 was a common occurrence, but the finale's Top 10 rank was the only such rank for season 8 and the first such rank since the season 7 premiere "FYI: I Hurt, Too".

Although having slipped down the overall rankings, ''Will & Grace'' ended its final, eleventh season as NBC's most watched comedy series.<ref name="hollywoodreporter.com">https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-7-day-season-averages-2019-20-broadcast-series-1297228</ref>

===Cultural impact===
The series was the first prime-time television series on U.S. terrestrial television to star openly gay lead characters, making it the highest-profile presence of LGBT characters on U.S. broadcast television since [[Ellen (TV series)|''Ellen'']]'s eponymous lead character's [[coming out|coming-out]] in the 1997 "[[The Puppy Episode|Puppy Episode]]". It has also been heralded as responsible for opening the door to a string of gay-themed television programs, such as ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', ''[[Queer Eye (2003 TV series)|Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'', and ''[[Boy Meets Boy (TV series)|Boy Meets Boy]]''.

In May 2012, during a ''[[Meet the Press]]'' interview with host [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]], U.S. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] cited the series as an influence in American thinking regarding LGBT rights, saying, "I think ''Will & Grace'' did more to educate the American public than almost anything anybody has ever done. People fear that which is different. Now they're beginning to understand."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/06/biden-says-he-is-absolutely-comfortable-with-same-sex-marriage/|title = Biden says he is 'absolutely comfortable' with same-sex marriage|date = May 6, 2012<!--, 12:03 PM ET-->|author = Jessica Yellin|publisher = CNN}}</ref> In the same interview, Biden stated that he was "absolutely comfortable" with [[same-sex marriage]], a statement which was followed on May 9 by President [[Barack Obama]]'s speaking in favor of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/09/obama-gay-marriage_n_1503245.html|title=Obama Backs Gay Marriage|author=Sam Stein|date=May 9, 2012|access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref> The day after Obama's statement, series co-creator Mutchnick later told ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' that Biden had spoken similar words at a private function which Mutchnick and his husband had attended two weeks prior to Biden's statement, although a White House official was cited by ''CBS This Morning's'' [[Bill Plante]] as asserting that the ''Meet the Press'' interview was not a "trial balloon" for the statement.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/barack-obama-gay-marriage-joe-biden-will-grace-max-mutchnick|title = 'Will & Grace' Co-Creator Says Joe Biden Mentioned Show Prior to Gay Marriage Endorsement|date = May 10, 2012|author = Aaron Couch|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref> Both Mutchnick and Kohan praised Biden's statement, but were critical of Obama's stance on marriage during the time between Biden's and Obama's statements.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118053645|title = 'Will & Grace' duo flattered by Biden shout-out|date = May 7, 2012|magazine = Variety|author = Ted Johnson}}</ref>

In 2004, the cast of the show were listed in [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]]'s ''100 Greatest TV Characters''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Greatest_TV_Characters//index.shtml |title=Bravo > 100 Greatest TV Characters |publisher=Bravo |accessdate=November 11, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QOBa5i9z?url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Greatest_TV_Characters//index.shtml |archivedate=July 17, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In 2012, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ranked ''Will & Grace'' the ninth-best NBC comedy of all time.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jen |last=Chaney|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/ranked-the-top-10-nbc-comedies-of-all-time/2012/09/10/9bb471e0-f90d-11e1-a073-78d05495927c_blog.html|title = Ranked: The top 10 NBC comedies of all time|date =October 9, 2012|work =[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

In 2014, scripts, props, and set decor from ''Will & Grace'' were donated to the [[National Museum of American History]], which is part of the Smithsonian.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/popnography/2014/08/20/original-transgender-pride-flag-will-grace-artifacts-smithsonian | title=Original Transgender Pride Flag, Will & Grace Artifacts Donated to Smithsonian &#124; Out Magazine | author=Out.com Editors | date=August 20, 2014 | access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref>

==Home media==
[[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]] has released all eight seasons of ''Will & Grace'' on DVD in Region 1, 2, and 4. The show was re-released and re-packaged on October 3, 2011, on region 2.

[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] currently holds the rights to the series in Region 1. On August 29, 2017, Universal re-released season 1 of the series on DVD in a 3-disc set. The re-release carries over all bonus features from the original Lionsgate release. It is unknown whether or not Universal will re-release the rest of the series.

On June 12, 2018, Universal released season 9 on DVD and made-on-demand Blu-Ray, as ''Will & Grace: The Revival - Season One'' in region 1. Season 10 was released as ''Will & Grace: The Revival - Season Two'' on DVD and made-on-demand Blu-Ray on June 18, 2019.

In Australia, after the original sets were released, the first reissues were released, with Season 1 & 2 on September 5, 2007, Season 3–5 on October 3, 2007 and Seasons 6–8 on November 21, 2007. These releases were then later packaged as 'The Complete Will & Grace Collection' box set which was released on November 19, 2008. The second reissue were the entire 8 seasons released in 2011 with updated artwork and then later packed as 'Will & Grace: All 8 Seasons' which was released on November 2, 2012. Then in 2014, the entire series were once again reissued, now back to the original artwork the same as the 2007 releases with some minor differences. Initially the 'All 8 Seasons' boxset was released with the 2011 reissues, but later editions contained the 2014 reissues. On June 13, 2018 another box set was released, 'Will & Grace: All 9 Seasons' which contained the 2014 reissues and the first season of the revival series.

According to Mullally, the project was cancelled due to the rights to the Karen character being withdrawn. Mullally stated to have already gained approval from the network, as well as having the Broadway production company Fox Theatricals, director and choreographer [[Casey Nicholaw]] and composer [[Jeff Blumenkrantz]] all lined up to participate in the production, before certain stakeholders in the Karen Walker character withdrew the rights for its use in the production.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgsC7Gfy_Uk&t=11m36s|title = Megan Mullally interview 2013 (in Aus)|date = July 26, 2013|website = YouTube|accessdate = April 21, 2014}}</ref>

===''Jack & Karen''===
There had been talk in 2008 that a spin-off was being developed by NBC entitled ''Jack & Karen'', featuring Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally reprising their roles. Hayes initially showed interest in the spin-off but was ultimately put off by the short-lived ''[[Friends]]'' spin-off, ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]''. Furthermore, Mullally's new work schedule in the form of her [[The Megan Mullally Show|talk show]], which was canceled several months later, did not allow her to pursue the spin-off at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystab.com/will-and-grace-spin-off-with-jack-and-karen|title=Will And Grace Spin-Off With Jack And Karen? » Entertainmentwise|date=October 4, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>

===''#VoteHoney''===
On September 26, 2016, the main cast—McCormack, Messing, Hayes, and Mullally, plus Morrison in a cameo role—reunited for a 10-minute web special, urging Americans to vote in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].<ref name="ABCnews2016electionreunion" /> In the special - titled ''#VoteHoney'' - Karen, an avid [[Donald Trump]] supporter, tries to persuade Jack to vote for Trump, while Will and Grace, both avid [[Hillary Clinton]] supporters, try to persuade him to vote for Clinton. At the end, Will reveals that singer [[Katy Perry]] is a supporter of Clinton, which persuades Jack to vote for Clinton. The success of the special resulted in the series' revival in 2017.
