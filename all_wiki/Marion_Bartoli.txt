'''Marion Bartoli''' ({{IPA-fr|maʁjɔ̃ baʁtɔli|lang}}; born 2 October 1984) is a French former professional tennis player. She won the [[2013 Wimbledon Championships]] singles title after previously being runner-up in [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|2007]], and was a semifinalist at the [[2011 French Open]]. She also won eight [[Women's Tennis Association]] singles and three doubles titles.<ref name="WTA_Stats">{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatour.com/page/Player/Stats/0,,12781~1007,00.html |title=wtatour.com -> Player profiles -> Marion Bartoli -> Stats |publisher=WTA |accessdate=7 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018042301/http://www.wtatour.com/page/Player/Stats/0%2C%2C12781~1007%2C00.html |archivedate=18 October 2010 }}</ref> She announced her immediate retirement from professional tennis on 14 August 2013.

Bartoli defeated three reigning world No. 1 players in her career: [[Justine Henin]] in the semifinal of the [[2007 Wimbledon Championships]], [[Jelena Janković]] in the fourth round of the [[2009 Australian Open]], and [[Victoria Azarenka]] in the quarterfinals of the [[2012 Sony Ericsson Open]]. She also recorded wins over other top players such as [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]], [[Ana Ivanovic]], [[Lindsay Davenport]], [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]], [[Dinara Safina]], [[Caroline Wozniacki]], [[Petra Kvitová]], [[Samantha Stosur]], and [[Kim Clijsters]].

She is known for her unorthodox style of play using two hands on both her forehand and backhand. On 30 January 2012 she reached a career-high ranking of No. 7 in the world; she returned to this ranking on 8 July 2013 after triumphing at Wimbledon. Bartoli reached at least the quarterfinal stage at each of the four Grand Slams. Her win at Wimbledon made her only the sixth player in the open era to win the Championships without dropping a single set.<ref name="BBC Sport">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/23212453|title=BBC Sport – Wimbledon 2013: Marion Bartoli beats Sabine Lisicki to win title|author=Aimee Lewis|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> She is also one of only three players ever to have played at both the [[WTA Tour Championships]] and the [[WTA Tournament of Champions]] (later renamed the [[WTA Elite Trophy]]) in the same year (2011); the other two being [[Kiki Bertens]] and [[Sofia Kenin]].<ref>[http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/08/16/how-will-marion-bartoli-be-remembered/ How will Marion Bartoli be remembered?], ''The Roar'', 16 August 2013</ref>

Bartoli was introduced to tennis by her medical doctor father, Walter, when she was six years old. She would practice tennis with him late at night after school on small, icy, unevenly surfaced courts which restricted free movement and influenced her playing style. When weather was sufficiently bad, they would train in an old indoor facility where there was very limited room between baseline and the wall, meaning Bartoli became adept at playing inside the baseline. He devised original training methods, such as improving hand-eye coordination by using balls of different size and color, or encouraging Marion to stay on her toes by taping tennis balls to the heels of her shoes. He drove hundreds of kilometres to tournaments while she would do her homework in the back of the car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2013-07-07/201307071373195652617.html |title=I just don't want to change' – Marion Bartoli |publisher=Wimbledon website |date=7 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925184042/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2013-07-07/201307071373195652617.html |archivedate=25 September 2013 }}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1"/>

In December 2019, Bartoli married Belgian football player [[Yahya Boumediene]]. The following May, they announced they were expecting a child.<ref>{{cite news |title=Marion Bartoli : qui est son mari, Yahya Boumediene ?|trans-title=Marion Bartoli: who is her husband, Yahya Boumediene |url=https://www.closermag.fr/people/photos-marion-bartoli-a-35-ans-qui-est-son-compagnon-yahya-boumediene-1031496 |accessdate=22 August 2020 |work=[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]] |date=29 May 2020 |language=French}}</ref>

==Playing style==
Bartoli was known for her unorthodox and intense style of play on the court. She used two hands on both the forehand and the backhand, and was generally classed as an aggressive and hard-hitting player who played primarily from the baseline. She developed her two-handed style on the advice of her father and longtime coach, Walter Bartoli. He had seen the classic 1992 French Open final in which [[Monica Seles]] defeated [[Steffi Graf]], and immediately was inspired to teach Seles' technique to his daughter. Bartoli had previously had trouble with her forehand, but it improved significantly when she made the switch to two hands. Her game was based on power and she used her double-fisted strokes to create sharp angles to open up the court and preferred to take the ball very early on groundstrokes.

Her serve was considered a weakness but her return of serve was considered to be her biggest weapon. She often stood well inside the baseline to receive serve, even on first serves, and managed to take advantage of break point opportunities.

Her style of play could be most closely compared to that of Seles, who had a strong influence on Bartoli as a young player. In a TV interview during the 2012 US Open tournament, Bartoli explained that both Seles and she are left-handed, and that she had a very weak forehand before changing to two hands.

Bartoli was not a very good mover on court, a state exacerbated by her two-fisted strokes, which made her vulnerable to fast all-court players such as [[Agnieszka Radwańska]] (whom she never beat). Instead, she relied on her excellent hand-eye coordination and anticipation skills. Bartoli did however work on her fitness and mobility throughout her career to varying success.

Bartoli was also known for her unusual serve, in which she used her wrist to generate speed. She also changed her service motion many times over the years. During the [[2013 Wimbledon Championships]], she had an unusual setup for serves – no ball-bouncing, arms crossed, right wrist resting on her left thumb before the toss.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/tennis/wimbledon13/story/_/id/9454395/2013-wimbledon-marion-bartoli-claims-final-straight-sets|title=Marion Bartoli seizes first major title|publisher=ESPN and Associated Press|date=6 July 2013}}</ref>

Bartoli manifested unusual on-court mannerisms, such as energetically bouncing on the spot and practising racquet swings between points, and being noticeably restless during changeovers. She claimed that this was to maintain the focus needed for her intense style of play.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1695354-off-beat-marion-bartoli-the-perfect-champion-for-wacky-2013-wimbledon|title=Off-Beat Marion Bartoli the Perfect Champion for Wacky 2013 Wimbledon|publisher=Bleacher Report|date=6 July 2013}}</ref>

==Relationship with her father and subsequent coaches==
Bartoli's father, who had no background in tennis, had years earlier retired from his career as a medical doctor to learn how to become a tennis coach and coach her to become a professional tennis player.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon-2013-womens-final-marion-bartoli-finds-selfbelief-to-beat-sabine-lisicki-on-the-greatest-stage-8693872.html|title=Wimbledon 2013 Women's Final: Marion Bartoli finds self-belief to beat Sabine Lisicki on the greatest stage|work=The Independent|date=7 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://zeenews.india.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon-2013/marion-bartoli-s-perfect-day-could-spark-more-glory_764709.html|title=Marion Bartoli's perfect day could spark more glory|publisher=Zeenews.com and AFP|date=7 July 2013}}</ref>
Bartoli has denied allegations that her close relationship with her father is a public show to hide a dominating parent. She has resisted pressure to play without him, including giving up the chance to play at the Olympics in London in 2012 because she would not play in the Fed Cup without his private coaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/26/sports/tennis/26iht-srfobartoli26.html|title=Bartoli, Guided by Her Father, Draws Inspiration From Seles's Example|date=26 May 2012|work=The New York Times}}</ref> In February 2013 Bartoli announced that the coaching setup with her father, who had been her coach throughout her tennis career, had come to an end by mutual agreement, and stated that she would be working with physical trainer Nicolas Perrotte and former player [[Gabriel Urpí]] until she found a new coach who could take her to the next level and help her win her first Grand Slam singles title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=485634881499824&set=a.180865308643451.47396.180841025312546&type=1&theater |title=Tijdlijnfoto's |publisher=Facebook }}</ref> The following month it was announced on the WTA website that Bartoli was being coached by [[Jana Novotná]], but they cancelled the coaching arrangement after a week with the conclusion of the [[Indian Wells Masters]] tournament. Bartoli was subsequently coached by the former World No. 1 [[Amélie Mauresmo]], under whom she won the [[2013 Wimbledon Championships]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/3102721/title/bartoli-too-solid-top-seeds-too |title=News|publisher=WTA Tennis English |accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref>

==Equipment==
Bartoli retired whilst using the [[Prince Sports|Prince]] EXO 3 Warrior racquet. She had previously used the Prince EXO3 Black and the Prince O3 Red. All her Prince racquets were specially modified in [[New York (state)|New York]] to make them longer by 2.0&nbsp;inches (to 29&nbsp;inches) than standard racquets to give her better reach with her two-handed strokes. She started using the 29-inch frames in 2006 and soon won her first tournament in [[2006 ASB Classic – Singles|Auckland]]. For many years she had no clothing sponsor, but wore [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. In October 2011, she signed a three-year clothing deal with [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]]. Before her breakthrough into the top 100, Bartoli was playing with a standard length [[Babolat]] racquet and she was wearing [[Le Coq Sportif]] apparel. Due to her small hands, her racquets had a very small grip size of 0.

==Tennis career==
===Early years===
Bartoli started entering tournaments regularly at the age of 16. After a few aborted starts in 1999 and 2000, she played in the $10,000 clay events in the spring of 2001. Winning two tournaments back to back in May (in Hatfield and Torino) ensured that she would be given a wildcard into her first Grand Slam, the [[French Open]], where she lost to [[Catalina Castaño]] in the first round. Bartoli also won another tournament in [[Koksijde]], Belgium.

In 2002, she received a wildcard into the [[Australian Open]]. She lost to [[Tina Pisnik]] in three sets. She then won her fourth ITF title in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. She followed that with a first-round exit at the French Open, losing in three sets to [[Ai Sugiyama]]. In the [[2002 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] where she qualified, she defeated Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, which was Bartoli's first win over a player in the top 100. She followed that with a win over [[Rossana de los Ríos]], before losing to fourth seed Lindsay Davenport.

===2003: US Open doubles semifinal===
Bartoli began 2003 by coming through the qualifying draw in the [[Canberra Women's Classic]] to reach her first WTA semifinal, where she lost to [[Francesca Schiavone]]. At the Australian Open, where she earned her place in a Grand Slam through her ranking for the first time, she lost to 11th seed [[Magdalena Maleeva]] in the first round. She qualified for [[NASDAQ-100 Open|Key Biscayne]] and made it to the quarterfinals, after Lindsay Davenport retired in their fourth-round match due to injury. In the quarterfinal she lost to Serena Williams.<ref>rte.ie [http://www.rte.ie/sport/2003/0325/tennis.html Contrasting fortunes for Williams sisters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201041649/http://www.rte.ie/sport/2003/0325/tennis.html |date=1 February 2009 }}</ref>

In the [[Internationaux de Strasbourg]] Bartoli reached the quarterfinals, where she lost to [[Vera Zvonareva]]. At the [[2003 French Open|French Open]], she earned another victory over Rossana de los Ríos, but lost to [[Jennifer Capriati]] in the second round. At her first [[2003 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], she drew the ninth seed [[Daniela Hantuchová]] in the first round, and lost.

At the [[Acura Classic]], Bartoli defeated her first top-20 player, [[Meghann Shaughnessy]], before losing to Kim Clijsters in the third round. At the US Open she lost to Hantuchová in the first round. But in doubles, she reached her first and only semifinal of doubles at Grand Slams. At the end of the year, she reached the quarterfinals of [[Bell Challenge]], losing to [[Milagros Sequera]].

===2004===
Bartoli began the season by getting to her first WTA semifinal in the season-opener in [[WTA Auckland Open|Auckland]]. She then got to the second round of the Australian Open for the first time, losing to 22nd-seeded [[Patty Schnyder]].

In February Bartoli played at the [[2004 Hyderabad Open|Hyderabad Open]], where she defeated [[Ankita Bhambri]], [[Galina Fokina]], and [[Mervana Jugić-Salkić]] to reach the semifinals, before losing to eventual champion [[Nicole Pratt]]. This performance briefly made her a top-50 player.

Bartoli refound her doubles form of late 2003. Partnering compatriot [[Émilie Loit]], she reached the semifinals of [[Abierto Mexicano TELCEL|Acapulco]], the quarterfinals of Indian Wells, and then Bartoli won her first WTA doubles title in Casablanca.

After a forgettable singles clay-court season (culminating in her second loss to Sugiyama at her native Grand Slam event), she climbed back up the rankings by reaching the third round of Wimbledon (losing to Sugiyama for the second successive Grand Slam). She also got to the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in doubles, partnering Loit for the second successive Grand Slam (they had failed to get beyond the second round of the French Open). Bartoli got to her third singles semifinal of the year in [[Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati]], before pulling out of her match with Lindsay Davenport with a blister on her right hand. She reached the second round of the US Open, despite being drawn against 32nd-seeded Meghann Shaughnessy in the first round. She lost to Russian [[Vera Dushevina]] in the second round.

In the absence of Amélie Mauresmo and [[Mary Pierce]] due to injuries, Bartoli received her debut [[Fed Cup]] call-up for [[France Fed Cup team|France]]'s semifinals against [[Spain Fed Cup team|Spain]]. She was teamed with Loit again and helped complete a 5–0 whitewash of the Spanish team. In the final against [[Russia Fed Cup team|Russia]], Bartoli's and Loit's doubles match against Myskina and Vera Zvonareva was the decisive rubber. The Russian pair won, earning the Fed Cup for Russia for the first time. As a result, Bartoli's team leader [[Guy Forget]] resigned, and she was not chosen by the new team leader [[Georges Goven]] to play in 2005.<ref>[http://www.tennis.com.cn/news/international/20041130/7649.html 网球网 – 丢了冠军 福尔热想要放弃] (Simplified Chinese only) {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

She ended 2004 ranked world No. 41, having gone 30–24 over the year. Her hard-court record was 23–13, with clay going 4–7, grass 3–3, and carpet 0–1.

===2005===
[[File:Marionbartoli.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Bartoli at the JP Morgan Chase Open, 2005]]
After a promising start (semifinals in Auckland and quarterfinals in Canberra), which took her to world No. 32 and winning the second doubles tournament of her career in [[Pattaya Women's Open|Pattaya City]], injury disrupted the second quarter of 2005. The only match Bartoli played in the clay-court season was her straight-sets first-round loss to [[Shahar Pe'er]] at the French Open (where she was seeded for the first time, 28th). Her quarterfinal run at Eastbourne (where she had to retire hurt) led her to a career-high ranking of No. 27 at the start of Wimbledon, where she lost to [[Jill Craybas]] in the second round.

Highlights of the year were reaching the third round of the US Open for the second time (losing to [[Sania Mirza]]) and making her second WTA semifinal of the year (and fifth of her career) in [[Bell Challenge|Québec]].

Her end-of-season statistics were 35–26, albeit padded by a victory in a satellite tournament in Doha at the end of the year. She went 30–21 on hard courts, 0–1 on clay, 3–3 on grass, and 2–1 on carpet. She was now ranked world No. 40.

===2006: First WTA title and top 20===
In January 2006, Bartoli at 21 years of age won her first senior title at the [[WTA Auckland Open|ASB Classic in Auckland]], New Zealand, beating Vera Zvonareva in the final. She then lost in the second round of the first three [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] events of the year (losing to [[Roberta Vinci]] in [[Australian Open|Australia]], Jelena Janković at the French Open, and [[Karolina Šprem]] at [[2006 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], all in three sets), but she won her third career doubles title by capturing the [[ECM Prague Open]] with Shahar Pe'er in May.

The North American summer hard-court season was very productive for Bartoli, as she reached the third round (and in some cases that meant the quarterfinals) of five of the seven tournaments she entered, including the US Open, where she again lost in the third round, this time to seventh-seeded Patty Schnyder. The following week she beat Schnyder en route to her second final of the year in Bali, where she lost to world No. 5 Svetlana Kuznetsova.

In October Bartoli won her second WTA singles title at the [[AIG Japan Open Tennis Championships]], beating [[Aiko Nakamura]] in the final. This was the first ever WTA final contested by two players using two-handed strokes on both the forehand and backhand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis-x.com/story/2006-10-09/k.php|title=Bartoli Wins All-Double-Fisted Tokyo Final|date=9 October 2006|work=Tennis-X|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref> As a result of winning the title, Bartoli broke into the top 20 for the first time. In her last event of the year, she captured the Bell Challenge in Québec, defeating [[Olga Puchkova]] without losing a game in the final.

Bartoli finished the year ranked world no. 17. Her record was 45–28, her best on tour so far. That consisted of 37–17 on hard courts, 4–6 on clay, 3–3 on grass, and 1–2 on carpet. She was 3–6 against top-10 players.

===2007: First Grand Slam final===
[[File:Marion Bartoli.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Marion Bartoli at the 2007 Acura Classic]]
Bartoli began 2007 with another second-round exit at the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]], this time falling to [[Victoria Azarenka]]. In the clay-court season, she reached the final of the [[ECM Prague Open]] in May, losing to [[Akiko Morigami]]. After reaching the semifinals in [[Internationaux de Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], she lost to Amélie Mauresmo. Bartoli reached her first career Grand Slam fourth round at the French Open by defeating [[Aravane Rezaï]], [[Andrea Petkovic]], and 13th seed [[Elena Dementieva]]. In the fourth round, she was knocked out by fourth seed Jelena Janković, though Bartoli injured her back during this match. In the grass-court season, she reached the semifinals at [[DFS Classic|Birmingham]], where she lost to Maria Sharapova. She also reached the semifinals at [[International Women's Open|Eastbourne]], but lost to world No. 1 Justine Henin.

At [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Bartoli advanced to her first Grand Slam final, after defeating top-seeded Justine Henin in the semi-final,.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cheese|first=Caroline|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/6278644.stm|title=Bartoli stuns Henin to reach final|publisher=BBC News|date=6 July 2007|accessdate=3 March 2009}}</ref> Bartoli lost the first set, and claimed afterwards that the reason for her turnaround in the match was seeing [[Pierce Brosnan]] in the royal box and being determined to play well in front of one of her favourite actors.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In the final, Bartoli lost to the three-time former champion [[Venus Williams]], but rose to a career high of No. 11 in the WTA rankings. At the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Bartoli reached the fourth round for the first time by defeating the world No. 25 [[Lucie Šafářová]], but lost to Serena Williams. At the [[Fortis Championships Luxembourg|Fortis Championships]] in Luxembourg, she reached her first semi-final since her Wimbledon run, but then lost to Daniela Hantuchová.

At the Tier I event in [[Zurich Open|Zurich]] Bartoli reached the quarter-finals, where she retired due to injury against [[Tatiana Golovin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,22617840-23216,00.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730173208/http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,22617840-23216,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 July 2012|title=Kuznetsova, Bartoli retire hurt|publisher=Foxsports.com.au|date=20 October 2007|accessdate=3 March 2009}}</ref> Despite her injury, Bartoli played at the [[Generali Ladies Linz]] in Austria, and reached the semi-finals, where she was defeated by [[Patty Schnyder]].

Her final record for the year was 47–31, with 19–16 on hard courts, 14–7 on clay, 12–3 on grass, and 2–5 on carpet. Her record against top-10 players was 4–8. Despite not having earned a single title all year, she ended the year at world No. 10.
