'''''Afrodisiac''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by American singer [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], released on June 28, 2004 by [[Atlantic Records]]. The album was recorded primarily in [[Los Angeles]] between spring 2003 and early 2004, following several major changes in Brandy's personal and professional life. After giving birth to her daughter and the demise of her relationship with the father, Brandy's team was given an overhaul, including changes in production, management, and A&R. The album marked a departure from her previous work, with Brandy collaborating with producer [[Timbaland]] and songwriter Candice Nelson, on the majority of the album's composition.

With many of their new relationships being the result of broken ones, Brandy and Timbaland were inspired to experiment with a number of sounds and influences to create a unique, individualized sound that was distinct from other R&B music. The result was an organic, mellow contemporary R&B album that experimented with the [[New York City|New York]]-based [[illbient]] style, which infuses eccentric [[breakbeat|hip-hop breakbeats]], [[Ambient music|ambient]] soundscapes, and the unorthodox [[sampling (music)|sampling]] of [[indie rock]] and various [[film scores]]. Brandy also continued to experiment with her singing, opting to use more technical applications of [[counterpoint]] and [[multi-track recording]] toward her vocal arrangements. An autobiographical album, the songs feature intimate lyrics which discuss the singer's personal struggles with [[codependency]], [[monogamy]], [[misplaced loyalty]], and professional anxiety.

Upon release, ''Afrodisiac'' was critically acclaimed for its mature lyrics, Brandy's vocalizing, and its overall experimental sound.<ref name="allmusic"/> The album has been called a predecessor to [[alternative R&B]], having been cited as an influence by artists such as [[Rihanna]] and [[Solange Knowles|Solange]]. ''Afrodisiac'' was nominated for several awards including nominations at the [[2004 MTV Video Music Awards]] and the [[47th Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref name="ew.com">{{cite web|title=Who'll Win Best Contemporary R&B Album?|date=2005-02-02|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1024185,00.html|accessdate=2009-06-13}}</ref> 
The album debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], eventually earning a gold certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="bind">{{cite web|first=Mariel|last=Concepcion|title=Brandy Inks Deal with Epic|date=2008-04-18|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045857/brandy-inks-new-deal-with-epic|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> Internationally, ''Afrodisiac'' scored minor success, appearing on the top 40 album charts in the [[UK albums chart|UK]], [[Canadian albums chart|Canada]], and [[Oricon|Japan]]. The album spawned three singles — "[[Talk About Our Love]]", "[[Who Is She 2 U]]" and "[[Afrodisiac (song)|Afrodisiac]]".

==Background==
In February 2002 Brandy released her third studio album ''[[Full Moon (Brandy album)|Full Moon]]'', it was preceded by the release of the lead single "[[What About Us? (Brandy song)|What About Us?]]" which became a worldwide top-ten hit, however the album's title track failed to chart or sell noticeably outside the United States and the United Kingdom, where it managed to enter the Top 20 chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Brandy&titel=What+About+Us%3F&cat=s|title='What About Us?'

During the production of the ''[[Full Moon (Brandy album)|Full Moon]]'' album, Norwood became involved romantically with producer [[Robert "Big Bert" Smith]]. The couple began a relationship during the summer of 2001, but their relationship did not become known until February 2002, the same month Norwood revealed that she was expecting her first child. However, a year after the birth of their daughter Sy'rai Iman Smith on June 16, 2002, Norwood and Smith officially announced their separation.<ref>{{cite web|author=LAUNCH Radio Networks |date=2003-06-27 |title=Brandy And Her Husband On The Outs? |work=Yahoo!

By the following year, Norwood had begun a relationship with [[NBA]] guard [[Quentin Richardson]]. The couple soon became engaged in July 2004 but Norwood eventually ended their 15-month engagement in October 2005.<ref name="Split">{{cite web|title=Brandy breaks off engagement|work=UPI News Service|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/brandy-breaks-off-engagement-quentin-richardson-morphs-tattoo-1005596.php |accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref>

==Recording==
Following the birth of her daughter Sy'rai in June 2002, Norwood soon entered recording studios to begin work on her then-untitled fourth album with producer [[Mike City]] and companion [[Robert "Big Bert" Smith]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Billy |last=Johnson |date=2002-09-27 |title=Brandy Preparing To Begin Work On New Album |work=Yahoo Music |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12064468 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20100117164136/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12064468 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-01-17 |accessdate=2007-01-18 }}</ref> As the singer envisioned the longplayer to sound "much rawer" and more "[[urban music|street]]" than its 2002 predecessor ''[[Full Moon (Brandy album)|Full Moon]]'', Smith quickly emerged as the album's executive producer and [[A&R]], replacing longtime contributor and mentor [[Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]], who Norwood felt was not going in the same direction creatively after all.<ref name="mtv1"/> About parting ways with Jerkins whose Darkchild team took production credits on her last two albums, Norwood commented that "Darkchild created a sound with me and gave it to everybody. I didn't like that [...] I needed to change my sound and I wanted to explore my versatility, my creativity and my art."<ref name="four">{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Jones|date=2004-07-15|title=An ''Afrodisiac'' toast to Brandy|work=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2004-07-15-brandy_x.htm|accessdate=2007-01-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2004-06-28|title=Talk About Our Love|work=Tourdates.co.uk|url=http://www.tourdates.co.uk/news/4199-Talk-About-Our-Love|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807060817/http://www.tourdates.co.uk/news/4199-talk-about-our-love|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-08-07|accessdate=2008-10-18}}</ref> The couple eventually finished a number of [[demo tape|demo recording]]s and at least four full songs until late November 2002, including "Ryde or Die" and Sy'rai-inspired "Sunshine;"<ref>{{cite web|date=2004-06-28 |title=R&B singer Brandy working on a new album |work=Xpress |url=http://www4.xpresssites.com/freedom/cityjunction/de/story.jsp?_RND=1855411219 |accessdate=2008-10-16 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and although Smith expected the album to drop by spring 2003 at one time or another,<ref name="mtv1">{{cite web|author=Reid, Shaheem|title=Brandy Makes Recording Next Album A Family Affair|date=2002-11-18|work=[[MTV News]]|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458737/11152002/brandy.jhtml|accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref> Norwood and Big Bert ended their relationship in mid-2003, resulting in the album's delay and several personnel changes.<ref name="two">{{cite web|author=Sedgewick, Augustin|title=Brandy Splits With Husband|date=2003-06-03|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5936231/brandy_splits_with_husband/print|accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref><ref name="ew8">{{cite web|title=Grammy-winning singer set to release her fourth album|date=2004-06-25|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,654443,00.html|accessdate=2009-06-27}}</ref>

Norwood eventually decided to scrap most of the project, and instead enlisted [[Timbaland]], with whom the couple had previously worked on [[Kiley Dean]]'s unreleased ''Simple Girl'' album, as the album's main contributor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kiley Dean's New Album|date=2003-06-01|work=Entertainment Showcase|url=http://www.kileyfan.com/con_info/articles/entshowcase.html|accessdate=2008-10-16|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525204808/http://www.kileyfan.com/con_info/articles/entshowcase.html|archive-date=2012-05-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> Impressed by Timaland's input, Norwood rediscovered the musical affection, she had missed on ''Full Moon'' and its technical priority. "I made the change because I needed to evolve. I needed to explore my talent and versatility and see if I had another side to me, another sound," she said about collaborating. "I wanted to do my own thing, and I've always wanted to work with Timbaland [...] and see how my voice would sound over his tracks.

Having concluded additional recording sessions with [[Warryn Campbell]], [[Theron Feemster]] and [[Organized Noise]], in November 2003, Atlantic Records announced that Norwood was putting the finishing touches on her still-untitled album, at that time scheduled for a release on March 2, 2004,<ref>{{cite web|title=Brandy To Release New Album In March |date=2003-11-20 |work=Yahoo Music |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12045983 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20100117164139/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12045983 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-01-17 |accessdate=2007-01-18 }}</ref> and she would shoot a [[music video]] for the "hyper, bass-heavy" banger "Black Pepper" during the second week of December.<ref name="vibe">{{cite web| title=Brandy&nbsp;— Not That Innocent| work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]| url=http://www.vibe.com/news/magazine_features/2004/06/cover_story_brandy_that_innocent/| accessdate=2007-01-17| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109174901/http://www.vibe.com/news/magazine_features/2004/06/cover_story_brandy_that_innocent/| archivedate=2007-11-09}}</ref> However, plans for the single fell through as the Timbaland-produced track was scrapped in favor of a new record: "[[Talk About Our Love]]", produced by rapper [[Kanye West]].

==Music and lyrics==
"It's about passion. It's romantic, and that's where I am in my life right now," Norwood noted during promotional touring in 2004, a time when she was engaged to [[New York Knicks]] guard [[Quentin Richardson]].<ref name="five"/> "I'm not ''trying'' to be edgy, sassy, romantic, vulnerable or whatever emotions come across," she said. "I really am all that."<ref>{{cite web|first=Gail|last=Mitchell|date=2004-06-27|title=Brandy's return burns with desire|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Press Enterprise|url=http://www.pe.com/entertainment/stories/PE_Fea_Ent_brandy28.e952.html|accessdate=2009-06-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040712005858/http://www.pe.com/entertainment/stories/PE_Fea_Ent_brandy28.e952.html|archivedate=2004-07-12}}</ref> While not a concept record, ''Afrodisiac'' features several consistent motifs throughout. It contains several lyrical references to [[1990s in music|1990s]] [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] culture figures, including Brandy herself, Timbaland and longtime partner [[Missy Elliott]], her peers [[Aaliyah]] and [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], American music video program ''[[Video Soul]]'' and its host [[Donnie Simpson]], hip-hop group [[Kid n' Play]] and their 1990 film ''[[House Party (film)|House Party]]'', sketch comedy television series ''[[In Living Color]]'', and [[Tony! Toni! Toné!]]'s 1996 studio album ''[[House of Music]]'' .<ref name="four"/> Throughout the album, [[English rock]] band [[Coldplay]] is used in both lyrical and musical concepts. In a 2013 interview, songwriter Candice Nelson discussed that coincidentally, she, Timbaland, and Brandy had all been privately listening to Coldplay's 2000 album ''[[Parachutes (album)|Parachutes]]''.<ref name="four"/><ref>{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Leo|date=2013-03-25|title=Exclusive With Candice Nelson|publisher=YouKnowIGotSoul.com|url=http://youknowigotsoul.com/exclusive-songwriter-candice-nelson-reveals-inspiration-behind-brandys-afrodisiac-album|accessdate=2018-01-01}}</ref> 

{{Quote box|width=20%|align=right|quote="On ''Afrodisiac'', you really get to know me as a person and I'm not sugarcoating any of the lyrics. My fans will be able to connect to it because they'll know exactly what I've been through."<ref name="ew8"/>|source=Brandy Norwood on ''Afrodisiac''.}} The general theme of anxiety runs through majority of the songs, with a lyrical focus on being critical of close personal and long-term professional relationships. She references her relationship with ex Robert Smith ("Who I Am", "I Tried", "Focus"), then-fiancé Quentin Richardson ("Where You Wanna Be", "Say You Will"), friends ("Sadiddy"), family ("Necessary"), career ("Should I Go"), and herself ("Come As You Are", "Finally"). The line "'Cause I don't wanna sound familiar, want a guaranteed single, not an album filler", from "Turn It Up" levels indirect criticism at creative differences with former main producer Rodney Jerkins and Atlantic Records staff.<ref name="two"/> On ending track "[[Should I Go]]", which interpolates Coldplay's "[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]]", Norwood openly talks about contemplating stepping away from the music business, admitting that she's trying to figure out where she fits in today.<ref name="four"/>

Although Norwood received a sole writing credit on album cut "Finally" only, she noted ''Afrodisiac'' the most honest effort of her career yet based on its deeply [[autobiographical]] content, commenting: "Everything I do has something to do with what I've gone through in my life [and] I definitely wanted to incorporate that in my art. It makes it more real when you add what's been going on in your life in your music. I've grown and I've gone through some things in my life, and I celebrate that, I honor that." Songwriter Nelson spoke further, saying, "[throughout this album] my thought was 'what's going on in her mind?' I wanted to observe her more than talk to her. First of all, I was starstruck, so I wanted to just watch her, and write from that. She was kind of shocked by what I would write. [Then] I was amazed, because she would take what I wrote and make this rainbow of sounds. She's so brilliant."<ref name="five1">{{cite web|first=Shaheem|last=Reid|date=2004-04-29|title=Brandy Gets Love From Kanye, Timbaland On New Album|work=MTV News|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486701/20040429/brandy.jhtml|accessdate=2008-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=O2 Chat: Brandy (Transcript) |work=O2 |url=http://www.o2.co.uk/fungames/chat/textchat/o2chatbrandy |accessdate=2008-10-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505011930/http://www.o2.co.uk/fungames/chat/textchat/o2chatbrandy |archivedate=2008-05-05 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Soundwise, her collaborator Timbaland spoke of their work on the album in his 2015 memoir ''[[Timbaland|The Emperor of Sound]]''.

==Impact and aftermath==
Despite its critical success, the album was largely seen as a commercial disappointment compared to Norwood's previous studio albums, due to the less-than-expected performance of its singles and the album.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Brandy and Kanye West – Talk About Our Love|url=http://acharts.us/song/478|work=aCharts|accessdate=2008-04-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080426015824/http://acharts.us/song/478| archivedate= 26 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Both Brandy and Timbaland later expressed frustration with the album, citing label interference with the creative process, politics, and mismanagement for the album's performance. After failing to properly secure a joint-headlining tour with [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], Brandy asked for and received an unconditional release from Atlantic Records at the end of 2004, citing her wish "to move on" as the main reason for her decision.<ref name="bind"/><ref name="mtv19">{{cite web|first=Alyssa|last= Rashbaum|title=Another Breakup For Brandy: This Time It's Her Label|work=[[MTV News]]|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1493335/20041101/brandy.jhtml|accessdate=2010-06-20|date=2004-11-01}}</ref> Completing her contract with the label, a compilation album titled ''[[The Best of Brandy]]'' was released in March 2005.
