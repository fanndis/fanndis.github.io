On May 4, 1998, a warrant was issued for his arrest by [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]].<ref name="febninth"/>  At the time the warrant was issued, Ressam was in Afghanistan, attending a [[terrorist training camp]].  He evaded deportation thereafter by using a [[Canadian passport]] he had obtained in March 1998 by submitting a [[baptismal]] certificate; he used a stolen blank certificate, filling it in with the fake name, "Benni Antoine Noris."<ref name="sent"/>

[[File:Derunta training camp after.jpg|thumb|left|[[Derunta training camp]],<br /> after U.S. bombardment]]

A six-person [[terrorist cell]] that included Ressam was created, and tasked with meeting in Canada. They were to attack a U.S. airport or consulate before the end of 1999.<ref name="febninth"/>  The cell was directed by Abu Jaffar in Pakistan and [[Abu Doha]] in Europe.<ref name="febninth"/>

Ressam returned to Montreal in February 1999 under the name "Benni Noris", bringing $12,000 in cash he had obtained in Afghanistan to fund the attack. He also brought in [[hexamine]] (used as an [[explosive booster]] in the manufacture of explosives) and [[glycol]], and a notebook with instructions for making explosives.<ref name="febninth" /><ref name="test" /> While in Montreal, he shared an apartment with [[Karim Said Atmani]], an alleged forger for the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria]].<ref name="csisAlmrei"/>

In April 1999, French investigators asked Canadian authorities to locate Ressam for questioning, but the Canadians were unable to locate him, as he was living under the name Benni Noris.<ref name="febninth"/><ref name="pbs"/>  In the summer of 1999, informed by [[Abu Doha]] that the other members of his cell had been unable to reach Canada due to immigration issues, he chose to continue without them.<ref name="febninth"/>

In August 1999, he decided to bomb [[Los Angeles International Airport]], the third-busiest airport in the world at the time. He was familiar with it and also thought it would be a politically and economically sensitive target.<ref name="sent"/><ref name="test"/>  He planned to conduct a rehearsal using a luggage cart, putting it in a place that was not suspicious, and observing how long it would take for airport security to notice it.<ref name="test"/>  He planned to execute his plan in a passenger waiting area, using one or two suitcases filled with explosives.<ref name="pbs"/><ref name="test"/>

In September 1999, Ressam purchased electronic equipment and components in order to build [[detonator]]s, and made four timing devices.<ref name="test"/>  He recruited [[Abdelmajid Dahoumane]], an old friend of his, to help him.<ref name="test"/>  In November, with Dahoumane's assistance, he bought [[urea]] and [[aluminum sulfate]] from [[Plant nursery|nurseries]], and mixed it together with [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[sulphuric acid]] he stole from fertilizer manufacturers to create a [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]-like explosive substance.<ref name="test"/>

Ressam was [[indict]]ed by a superseding indictment on January 20, 2000, for nine counts of criminal activity in connection with his attempt to bomb the Los Angeles International Airport on December 31, 1999:  1) an act of terrorism transcending a national boundary; 2) placing an explosive in proximity to a terminal; 3) false identification documents; 4) use of a fictitious name for admission to the U.S.; 5) the [[felony]] of making a false statement to a U.S. Customs official; 6) smuggling; 7) transportation of explosives; 8) possession of an unregistered firearm; and 9) carrying an explosive during the commission of a felony.<ref name="indi"/><ref name="sc"/><ref name="febninth">{{cite web|url=http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/US_v_Ressam_9thcircuitappeals0210.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004023628/http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/US_v_Ressam_9thcircuitappeals0210.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2012 |title=U.S. v.

Following a 19-day trial in [[U.S. District Court]] in  [[Los Angeles]], with approximately 120 witnesses, a jury found Ressam guilty on all counts of his indictment on April 6, 2001.<ref name="febninth"/><ref>[http://nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/U.S._v_Ressam_DOJPRConviction.pdf "Statement of Attorney General John Ashcroft; Conviction of Ahmed Ressam," U.S. Department of Justice, April 6, 2001, accessed February 15, 2010]</ref>  That same day, he was convicted ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' in France, and sentenced to five years for conspiring to commit terrorist acts there.<ref name="pbs"/>

'''Cooperation and sentencing'''

Ressam's sentencing was delayed for four years, to give counter-terrorism analysts a chance to fully exploit him as an intelligence source. Facing up to 130 years in prison, Ressam began cooperating with investigators after his conviction. He entered into a June 23, 2001, cooperation agreement with the U.S. government.<ref name="febninth"/>  Under the agreement, after he cooperated fully with the U.S. and other governments, the U.S. government would recommend a prison sentence taking his cooperation into consideration, though the recommendation would not under any circumstances be less than 27 years.<ref name="sent">{{cite web|url=http://intelfiles.egoplex.com/ressam-sentencing-memo.pdf |title=Government's Sentencing Memorandum; ''U.S. v. Ressam''|date=April 20, 2005|accessdate=August 26, 2015}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

Ressam provided information to law enforcement officials of the U.S. and six other countries with regard to al-Qaeda's organization, recruitment, and training activities.<ref name="febninth"/> He revealed that al-Qaeda [[sleeper cell]]s existed within the U.S.<ref name="febninth"/> This information was included in the [[President's Daily Brief]] delivered to President [[George W. Bush]] on August 6, 2001, entitled ''[[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US]]''. He testified in July 2001 against his accomplice and co-conspirator, Haouari. In addition, Ressam said that [[Ahcene Zemiri]], a fellow Algerian who was being held at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], was involved in the plot. Zemiri's [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] used this information to continue to hold Zemiri as [[unlawful combatant]], without charges.<ref name="febninth"/>

Ressam's accusations were used as the basis of 7 of the 12 unclassified allegations in the [[Summary of Evidence (CSRT)|Summary of Evidence memo]] prepared for [[Abu Zubeida]]'s [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]].<ref name="join"/><ref name="CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript"/> ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' opined that the intelligence analysts' reliance on Ressam's confessions was due to wanting unclassified allegations against Abu Zubeida to be based on evidence that was not gained through torture.<ref name=GlobeAndMail20070417>

None of the evidence gained through coercive interrogation could be admitted to court.

Ressam had trained with Zacarias Moussaoui at Khalden Camp and was able to identify him when asked. Moussaoui was an al-Qaeda member later implicated in the 9/11 plot.<ref name="a911"/>  Moussaoui had been arrested by the FBI on August 16, 2001.<ref name="a911"/>  However, FBI agents were not successful in convincing their superiors of enough evidence against him to obtain a warrant to allow them to search Moussaoui's laptop and belongings.<ref name="a911"/> The [[9/11 Commission Report]] opined that had Ressam been asked about Moussaoui, he would have broken that logjam.<ref name="a911"/>

By November 28, 2001, Ressam began to express reluctance about discussing some matters.<ref name="febninth"/> By early 2003, after having provided 65 hours of trial and deposition testimony and the names of 150 people involved in terrorism, he stopped cooperating. He began to recant his prior testimony.<ref name="febninth"/>

The ''[[Seattle Times]]'' described Ressam's sentencing hearing as the "gripping climax" to his journey through the U.S. court system.<ref name=SeattleTimes20050728/>  U.S. Attorney [[John McKay (attorney)|John McKay]] argued Ressam should get a 35-year sentence, because he had declined to cooperate in two cases, which would go unprosecuted.<ref name=SeattleTimes20050728/>  Ressam's lawyer argued that Ressam should be given a sentence of less than 20 years, to reflect the value of his original cooperation, saying: "It is a flat fact that law enforcement, the public, and public safety benefited in immeasurable ways from Ressam's decision to go to trial and [later] cooperate."<ref name=SeattleTimes20050728/>  Ressam did not say anything during his sentencing hearing, but sent the judge a personal note, in which he apologized for planning to bomb the airport.<ref name=SeattleTimes20050728/>

On July 27, 2005, [[United States District Court]] Judge [[John Coughenour]] sentenced Ressam to 22 years in prison, plus 5 years of supervision after his release; credited for good conduct, he could have been released after 14 years.<ref name=SeattleTimes20050728>{{cite news

}}</ref> According to the ''Seattle Times'', the judge used the occasion of Ressam's sentencing 
<blockquote>to unleash a broadside against secret tribunals and other war on terrorism tactics that abandon 'the ideals that set our nation apart.'"<ref name=SeattleTimes20050728/>  The judge added: "The tragedy of September 11 shook our sense of security and made us realize that we, too, are vulnerable to acts of terrorism. Unfortunately, some believe that this threat renders our Constitution obsolete ... If that view is allowed to prevail, the terrorists will have won.<ref name=SeattleTimes20050728/></blockquote>

In November 2006, Ressam wrote to Judge Coughenour, recanting his accusations against Zemiri and saying he had not participated at all in the bombing plot. Zemiri's attorneys advised the military lawyers at Guantanamo and incorporated this information in his ''habeas corpus'' case. Zemiri was released without charge finally in January 2010 and repatriated to Algeria, his country of citizenship.

'''Appeals and sentencing guidelines'''

On January 16, 2007, a divided panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] in [[Seattle]] reversed Ressam's conviction on one of the charges, due to the majority's reading of the applicable law. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] overturned the Ninth Circuit in an 8–1 decision on May 19, 2008, restoring the original convictions and sentence.<ref name="sc"/><ref>{{cite news | title = Supreme Court restores full prison term in LAX plot by 'millennium bomber' | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = May 20, 2008 }}</ref>

On February 2, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Ressam's 22-year sentence was too lenient, and did not fit in the then-mandatory [[sentencing guidelines]], which indicated he should have received at least 65 years, and up to 130 years, in prison.<ref name="febninth"/>  Finding that the trial court judge's "views appear too entrenched to allow for the appearance of fairness on [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]," the appellate court ordered that Ressam be re-sentenced by a different district court judge from the one who had handed down the original sentence.<ref name="febninth"/><ref name="CNN1"/>  In March 2010, Ressam's lawyer said he would file a petition for a rehearing before the Ninth Circuit Court.<ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iRGiADttXMtTba1dlJcXQiVkaFYgD9EGG3EG3 "Millennium plotter appealing sentence decision", ''Associated Press'', March 17, 2010, accessed March 18, 2010]</ref> In October 2012, he was re-sentenced to 37 years' imprisonment. Ressam is serving his sentence at [[ADX Florence]], a maximum security prison in Colorado.<ref>[[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], [http://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/ Inmate Locator]: Ahmed Ressam, white male, #29638-086, scheduled release 12/27/2032.</ref>
