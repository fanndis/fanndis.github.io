'''Benjamin John Pimlott''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (4 July 1945 – 10 April 2004), known as '''Ben Pimlott''', was a British historian of the post-war period in Britain. He made a substantial contribution to the literary genre of political biography.

==Early life==
Pimlott was born on 4 July 1945. His father was John Pimlott, a civil servant at the [[Home Office]] and former private secretary to [[Herbert Morrison]].<ref name=Telegraph>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1459105/Ben-Pimlott.html|title=Ben Pimlott|work=The Telegraph|date=13 April 2004|access-date=28 September 2020}}</ref> He was educated at [[Rokeby Preparatory School|Rokeby School]] (at the time in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]]), [[Marlborough College]] and [[Worcester College, Oxford]], where he took a degree in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] and a [[Bachelor of Philosophy|BPhil]] in politics, having originally won a scholarship to study there.<ref name=Telegraph></ref> In 1970, he was appointed as a lecturer in the politics department of the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle]], where he also took his PhD. In the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Pimlott contested [[Arundel (UK Parliament constituency)|Arundel]] on behalf of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and [[Cleveland and Whitby]] the following [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October]]. Having lost on both occasions, he also contested the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 election]], after which he left the [[North East England|North East]] to take up a research post at the [[London School of Economics]], moving to a lectureship at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], [[London]] in 1981.<ref name="Morgan">Kenneth O.

==Writing==
During 1987–88, he was Political Editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine and took on the post of Professor of Contemporary History at Birkbeck in 1988. For the following two years, Pimlott was responsible, with friends, for the short-lived journal ''Samizdat''.<ref name="Morgan"/>

Aside from his attempts at a Parliamentary career in the 1970s, not to mention his tenure as Chairman of the [[Fabian Society]] in 1993/1994, Pimlott is best remembered for his works of political biography including  lives of [[Hugh Dalton]] (1985), [[Harold Wilson]] (1992), and a study of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] (1996). His study of Dalton won him the [[Whitbread Prize]]. His other books include ''Labour And The Left In The 1930s'' (1977), ''The Trade Unions In British Politics'' (with Chris Cook, 1982), ''Fabian Essays In Socialist Thought'' (1984), ''The Alternative'' (with Tony Wright and Tony Flower, 1990), ''Frustrate Their Knavish Tricks'' (1994) and ''Governing London'' (with Nirmala Rao, 2002).

==Views and legacy==
Many of Pimlott's theses have stood the test of time, even if they were marginally controversial when originally published. His studies of the 1930s Labour left, the life of Harold Wilson and the constitutional effect of the [[monarchy]] in post-war Britain are said to have made his reputation as a biographer and even bestowed some additional credibility upon the subjects, all of which have received critical accounts under the pen of others. Pimlott sincerely believed and argued consistently that the [[post-war consensus]] in [[British politics]] was a red-herring.

In 1996 his works were recognised with a Fellowship of the [[British Academy]]. At the time of his death from [[leukemia]] in 2004, he was Warden of [[Goldsmiths, University of London]] (since 1998). He was married to [[Jean Seaton]], who lectures on communications and the media at the [[University of Westminster]]. In 2005 the college named a major new [[Will Alsop]]-designed building on its [[New Cross]] site in his honour and also the same year the Fabian Society and ''[[The Guardian]]'' inaugurated the first annual Ben Pimlott Prize for Political Writing.
