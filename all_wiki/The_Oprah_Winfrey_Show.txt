'''''The Oprah Winfrey Show''''', often referred to as '''''The Oprah Show''''' or simply '''''Oprah''''', is<!--NOT "was" due to literary present tense: i.e. the show did not stop being a show just because it no longer airs--> an American daytime [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[talk show]] that aired nationally for 25 seasons from September 8, 1986, to May 25, 2011, in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Produced and hosted by its namesake, [[Oprah Winfrey]], it remains one of the highest-rated daytime talk shows in [[American television history]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Lacey |date=January 29, 2009 |title=America's Top-Earning Black Stars |journal=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/29/oprah-will-smith-business-media-0129_black_stars.html |access-date=May 23, 2012}}</ref>

The show was highly influential to many young stars, and many of its themes have penetrated into the American pop-cultural consciousness. Winfrey used the show as an educational platform, featuring book clubs, interviews, self-improvement segments, and philanthropic forays into world events. The show did not attempt to profit off the products it endorses; it had no licensing agreement with retailers when products were promoted, nor did the show make any money from endorsing books for its book club.<ref>{{cite news |last=Carr |first=David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/business/media/23carr.html |title=The Media Equation – Oprah Winfrey's Success Owes to Decisions That Avoided Common Traps |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 22, 2009 |access-date=May 26, 2011}}</ref>

''Oprah'' had its roots in ''A.M. Chicago'', a half-hour morning talk show airing on [[WLS-TV]], an ABC owned-and-operated station in [[Chicago]]. Winfrey took over as host on January 2, 1984, and, within a month, took it from last place to first place in local Chicago ratings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/pressroom/Oprah-Winfreys-Official-Biography/2 |title=Oprah Winfrey's Official Biography |date=May 17, 2011 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 26, 2012}}</ref> Following Winfrey's success in—and [[Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe]] nominations for-her performance as Sofia in the film  ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', on September 8, 1986, the talk show was relaunched under its current title and picked up nationally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/pressroom/Oprah-Announces-Plans-to-End-The-Oprah-Winfrey-Show-in-September-2011/2 |title='The Oprah Winfrey Show' to End September 2011 |publisher=Oprah.com |date=November 20, 2009 |access-date=May 26, 2011}}</ref> For the premiere, the show's producers tried rigorously to book ''[[Miami Vice]]'''s [[Don Johnson]] as the first guest, even trying to bribe him with [[Dom Pérignon]] and a pair of rhinestone sunglasses. All attempts to book Johnson failed and Winfrey decided to "do what we do best, and that is a show about and with everyday people". The theme for the premiere show was "How to Marry the Man or Woman of Your Choice".<ref>{{cite journal |year=2011 |title=The Big Premiere |journal=O, the Oprah Magazine |issue=Official Commemorative Edition |pages=14 |publisher=Harpo Print, LLC }}</ref>

''Oprah'' was one of the longest-running [[daytime television]] talk shows in history. The show received 47 [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s before Winfrey chose to stop submitting it for consideration in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/The-Oprah-Winfrey-Show-Trivia |title='The Oprah Winfrey Show': Trivia |date=January 1, 2006 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 26, 2012}}</ref> In 2002, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it at #49 on [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|''TV Guide''{{'}}s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbsnews.com/news/tv-guide-names-top-50-shows|title=TV Guide Names Top 50 Shows|publisher=CBS News}}</ref> In 2013, they ranked it as the 19th greatest TV show of all time.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fretts |first1=Bruce |last2=Roush |first2=Matt |title=The Greatest Shows on Earth |journal=TV Guide Magazine |volume=61 |issue=3194–3195 |pages=16–19 |doi= <!--|access-date=22 December 2013 -->}}</ref>

In November 2009, Winfrey announced that the show would conclude in 2011 following its 25th and final season. The series finale aired on May 25, 2011.

== Interviews ==
Winfrey interviewed a plethora of public figures and everyday people during the show's 25-year history. When celebrities and newsmakers were ready to share their most intimate secrets their first stop was Winfrey's couch and when a serious story hit, the ''Oprah'' show focused on putting a human face on the headlines.

=== Celebrities ===
Winfrey claims her worst interviewing experience was with [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in the show's second season. Just before the interview, Taylor asked Winfrey not to ask any questions about her relationships. Winfrey found this to be a challenge considering Taylor had been married seven times. Taylor returned to the show in 1992, apologized to Winfrey and told her that she was in excruciating back and hip pain at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/25-Most-Watched-Oprah-Show-Episodes/12 |title=Elizabeth Taylor – Most Watch Oprah Shows |date=April 29, 2011 |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 26, 2012}}</ref>

On February 10, 1993, Winfrey sat down in a prime-time special broadcast with [[Michael Jackson]], who had performed nine days earlier in the [[Super Bowl XXVII halftime show]], for what would become the most-watched interview in television history. Jackson, an intensely private entertainer, had not given an interview in 14 years. The event was broadcast live from Jackson's [[Neverland Ranch]] and was watched by 90 million people worldwide and, as a result, his then 14 month old studio album [[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]] hit the top-ten on the album charts. Jackson discussed missing out on a normal childhood and his strained relationship with his father, [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joe Jackson]]. During the interview, Jackson attempted to dispel many of the rumors surrounding him and told Winfrey he suffered from the skin-pigment disorder known as [[vitiligo]] when asked about the change in the color of his skin. While admitting to getting a nose job, he denied all other plastic surgery rumors. Later in the interview, Jackson was joined by his close friend Elizabeth Taylor, her third appearance on the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/entertainment/Oprah-Reflects-on-Her-Interview-with-Michael-Jackson/1 |title=Oprah Reflects on Her Interview with Michael Jackson |date=September 16, 2009 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

Winfrey's interview with [[Tom Cruise]], which was broadcast on May 23, 2005, also gained notoriety. Cruise "jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell rapturously to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his then-girlfriend, [[Katie Holmes]]."<ref>{{cite news | work =The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/02/movies/02crui.html | title = How Personal Is Too Personal for a Star Like Tom Cruise? | first= Sharon | last= Waxman | author-link= Sharon Waxman | date =June 2, 2005 | access-date=August 22, 2013}}</ref> This scene quickly became part of American pop-cultural discourse and was heavily parodied in media.

[[Celine Dion]] appeared on the show 28 times, the most of any celebrity, besides [[Gayle King]], Winfrey's best friend, who appeared 141 times.<ref>{{cite journal |year=2011 |title=Repeat Attenders |journal=Oprah Official Commemorative Edition |pages=69 |publisher=Harpo Print, LLC. }}</ref>

Winfrey also interviewed Chicago's "Guardian Angels" and Raymond Lear in 1988.

=== Notable guests ===
Winfrey interviewed Kathy Bray three weeks after her 10-year-old son, Scott, was accidentally killed by a friend who had found his father's gun. Viewers later commented that the interview changed their feelings about having guns in their homes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Viewers-Choices/9 |title=Viewers' Choice |date=January 1, 2006 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

In the 1989–90 season, [[Truddi Chase]]—a woman who was diagnosed with [[dissociative identity disorder]], having 92 distinct personalities—appeared on the show. Chase had been violently and sexually abused beginning at the age of two and said her old self ceased to exist after that. After introducing Chase, who was there to promote her book ''When Rabbit Howls'', Winfrey unexpectedly broke down in tears while reading the teleprompter, relating her own childhood molestation to that of the guest. Unable to control herself, Winfrey repeatedly asked producers to stop filming.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Truddi-Chases-Multiple-Personalities/1 |title=Truddi Chase on Sexual Abuse and Multiple Personalities |date=May 21, 1990 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 26, 2012}}</ref>

Erin Kramp, a mother dying of breast cancer, appeared on the show in 1998. After realizing that her six-year-old daughter, Peyton, would have to grow up without her, Kramp began recording videotapes filled with motherly advice on everything from makeup tips to finding a husband. She also wrote letters and bought gifts for Peyton to open every Christmas and birthday she was gone. Kramp lost her battle with cancer on October 31, 1998. She had recorded over a hundred videos and audiotapes for her daughter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/In-Memoriam-Remembering-Oprah-Show-Guests/6 |title=In Memoriam – Erin Kramp |date=May 16, 2011 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 26, 2012}}</ref>

Jo Ann Compton's daughter Laurie Ann was stabbed to death in 1988—and a decade later, the mom was tangled in her grief. "I hope they're in the same hell I'm in." she said of her daughter's murderers on a 1998 show. Oprah brought in Dr. Phil to help Jo Ann. He asked her if she thought her daughter would want her to be in so much pain—and Compton said no. "Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life.” Phil continued. "She lived for 18 vibrant years, and you focus on the day she died." After a moment, Compton uttered her breakthrough sentence: "I never thought of it that way." Later, she sobbed while revealing that she had been planning to end her life after the show. When Compton returned to the show in 2011, she had a new viewpoint on the daughter she lost: "She continues to stay alive every time I do something positive." Compton's surviving daughter, Cindy, said "She went from existing to living. It was an amazing transformation."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/The-Greatest-Lessons-on-The-Oprah-Show_1/2 |title=Jo Ann Compton's Profound Moment |date=May 13, 2011 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

In 2001, Winfrey met 11-year-old [[Mattie Stepanek]], who was born with [[dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy]] and wrote inspirational poetry he titled "Heartsongs."  On the show, Stepanek stated, "A heartsong doesn't have to be a song in your heart. It doesn't have to be talking about love and peace. … It's your message, what you feel like you need to do."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Meeting-Mattie-Stepanek/4 |title=Mattie Stepanek's Heartsongs |date=October 19, 2001 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 26, 2012}}</ref> In October 2008, Winfrey spoke at the posthumous dedication of Mattie J.T Stepanek Park in Maryland.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mattieonline.com/?page_id=1782 | title=Mattie's Death & Legacy – Mattie J.T.

== Regular segments and campaigns ==
===Oprah's Book Club===
{{Main|Oprah's Book Club}}
Originally featured a monthly book highlight, including author interviews. Its popularity caused featured books to shoot to the top of bestseller lists, often increasing sales by as many as a million copies at its peak. It was suspended in 2002 and returned in 2003, featuring more classic works of literature, with reduced selections per season. The original format was reintroduced in September 2005, but Winfrey's selection of [[James Frey|James Frey's]] ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' became controversial due to accusations of falsification. January 2006 saw [[Elie Wiesel|Elie Wiesel's]] ''[[Night (book)|Night]]'' selected; Winfrey even traveled to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] with Wiesel. In 2008, [[Eckhart Tolle|Eckhart Tolle's]] ''[[A New Earth]]'' was selected. Modernizing the book club's platform, Winfrey and Tolle began a series of live webcast classes that were streamed on Oprah.com to discuss elements of the book with a worldwide audience.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahsbookclub/A-New-Earth-Are-You-Ready-to-be-Awakened |title=A New Earth: Are You Ready to be Awakened? |date=January 30, 2008 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

===Oprah's Favorite Things===
{{Main|Oprah's Favorite Things}}
Items personally favored by Winfrey were featured on the show and given away to audience members. Since its launch in 1996, the "Favorite Things" episode quickly became the hottest ticket in television. When a product was featured, its sales skyrocketed. Select groups were sometimes chosen to receive the items. In 2004, the audience was made up of educators from across the country. [[Hurricane Katrina]] volunteer workers were invited to the 2005 show. Winfrey has said that the [[iPad]], given away to her 2010 audience, was her all-time favorite "Favorite Thing". During a ''Season 25: Oprah Behind the Scenes'' episode documenting the production of the giveaway, Winfrey talked about why the event resonates with viewers:
{{Quote|The ''things'' of "Favorite Things" is the least of the experience. It's sharing that moment with 300 other people, acknowledging that surprise and fantastical, sensational, wonderful, happy things can still occur in your life.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Oprah's Ultimate Favorite Things |series=Season 25: Oprah Behind the Scenes |network=OWN |date=February 4, 2011 |season=1 |number=7 }}</ref>}}

===Oprah & Gayle's Big Adventures===
Winfrey and Gayle King are friends. In 1976, Winfrey was working as a news anchor in Baltimore when she met King, a production assistant. The two bonded during a snowstorm when Winfrey told King she could stay at her home to wait it out. Their friendship was often showcased on the show when the best friends decided to take a trip together.

In 2004, they traveled back in time, participating in the [[PBS]] series ''[[Colonial House (TV series)|Colonial House]]''. The series intended to recreate daily life in [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1628. Their 24-hour Puritan adventure included wood-chopping, cooking over an open fire, battling with mice, and using leaves as toilet paper.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprah-Goes-Colonial_2 |title=Oprah and Gayle: Back in Time |date=October 29, 2010 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

Winfrey and King joined 60 other women for a spa getaway in 2006. They spent five days at Miraval Life in Balance Resort and Spa taking part in self-improvement exercises. For an exercise called A Swing and a Prayer, the women were hoisted 40 feet in the air and told to let go. Once in the air, King—who is afraid of heights—wouldn't let herself fall. Winfrey couldn't help but laugh as King remained in the air, but eventually persuaded her to let go.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprah-and-Gayles-Big-Spa-Adventure_1 |title=Oprah and Gayle's Big Spa Adventure |date=October 29, 2010 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

In the summer of 2006, Winfrey and King decided to go on an 11-day, 3,600-mile road trip across America – from California to New York. They were excited to meet people from small towns and see how America really lives. However, the initial excitement quickly wore off. The friends had minor meltdowns and fought for control over the radio; King likes to have music constantly playing while driving, Winfrey prefers silence. Despite the challenges of the road trip, they got to see the beauty of [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], meet the people of [[Navajo Nation]], crash a couple of weddings, take a dip in the healing waters of [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado|Pagosa Springs]], and learn about [[Amish]] culture. Winfrey's many driving anxieties and King's tone-deaf singing made the trip a huge hit with viewers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprah-and-Gayles-Road-Trip |title=Oprah and Gayle's Road Trip |date=October 29, 2010 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

The friends visited the [[State Fair of Texas]] in 2009. They played traditional state fair games like Flip-the-Chick and the water gun race. They tried many of the fried foods offered at the fair and judged a best "Best of Show" food contest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprah-and-Gayles-New-Adventure-The-Biggest-State-Fair-in-Texas_1 |title=Oprah and Gayle's New Adventure: The Biggest State Fair in Texas |date=October 29, 2010 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

For the farewell season, the best friends hit the road again for an overnight camping trip at [[Yosemite National Park]]. Park ranger Shelton Johnson wrote to Winfrey because he was concerned by the low number of African-Americans who visited the national parks each year. So Winfrey and King packed up their camper and headed to Yosemite to help Johnson attract visitors. When they arrived, Johnson took Winfrey and King around the park to see some of its famous sites including [[Mariposa Grove]] and the [[Wawona Tunnel|Tunnel View]], from which [[El Capitan]] is visible in the distance. On the way to the campsite, Winfrey made a sharp turn causing their trailer to hit a rock. After setting up their pop-up camper, the two mixed up some [[Moscow mule|Moscow Mules]] to pass out to their camping neighbors. The drink has become a signature ''Oprah'' cocktail. The next day they took a lesson in fly fishing and wrapped up their stay with a mule ride.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprah-and-Gayles-Big-Yosemite-Camping-Adventure_1 |title=Oprah and Gayle's Big Yosemite Camping Adventure |date=October 29, 2010 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

===Remembering Your Spirit===
A segment at the end of the show that featured spiritual counselors, ordinary people who had been involved in extraordinary situations. They would come on the show and share their stories of overcoming adversity with the audience, inspiring viewers to do the same in their own lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cultureschlockonline.com/Articles/talkshow.html |title=Television Talk Shows |author=Marjorie Dorfman |work=Web |publisher=Culture Shock Online |access-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

===Change Your Life TV===
====Iyanla Vanzant====
[[Iyanla Vanzant]] is a former attorney, spiritual teacher and self-help expert who was a regular on the show in the late 1990s. She started the show in its 12th season and became known for her no-nonsense, hard-hitting, and often humorous advice. Vanzant's take on everything from cheating spouses to financial struggles connected with viewers and, at times, Winfrey sat in the audience while Vanzant led the show. Her books ''In the Meantime'' and ''One Day My Soul Just Opened Up'' became ''New York Times'' bestsellers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Iyanla-Vanzant-Returns-to-The-Oprah-Show |title=Iyanla Vanzant Returns to The Oprah Show |date=February 16, 2011 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 27, 2012}}</ref>

====Dr. Phil====
Winfrey met [[Phil McGraw]] when he worked as a consultant for her legal team during her 1998 beef trial in [[Amarillo, Texas]]. Starting in April of that year, he became a fixture on the show and a viewer favorite. McGraw gave guests tough, tell-it-like-it-is advice and didn't allow excuses or rationalizations for their bad habits, bad marriages, or bad attitudes. His popular Tuesday appearances on the show led to his own talk show, ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'', in 2002.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oprah Show Official Commemorative Edition|publisher=O, The Oprah Magazine|year=2011|page=76}}</ref>

====Suze Orman====
Financial expert [[Suze Orman]] became a viewer favorite, offering money tips, spending interventions, and her famous "Suze smackdowns." She encouraged people to be honest with themselves about what they could afford and gave advice on getting rid of credit card debt. Her motivational approach to fixing finances has led to her own financial advice empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/own-ask-oprahs-all-stars/Ask-Oprahs-All-Stars-Suze-Orman-Bio-151-OWN-TV |title=Ask Oprah's All Stars Suze Orman |year=2011 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

===What's The Buzz?===
Winfrey introduced up-and-coming public figures who generated industry buzz but not otherwise widely known. In what several media commentators have labelled ''The Oprah Effect'', people appearing on this segment such as Oscar-winner [[Jamie Foxx]] and singer [[James Blunt]] benefited from the extra publicity the show garnered. Blunt, in particular, saw album sales increase dramatically and landed a Top Two spot on the ''Billboard'' 200.

===Wildest Dreams===
A show feature called "Wildest Dreams" fulfilled the dreams of people reported to Winfrey by the producers – mostly viewers who wrote into the show – be the dreams of a new house, an encounter with a favorite performer, or a guest role on a popular TV show. It was named after the [[Tina Turner]] song "[[In Your Wildest Dreams (song)|In Your Wildest Dreams]]," and Turner was one of the celebrities featured on the segment.

===Tuesdays with Dr. Oz===
[[Mehmet Oz]], the head of cardiac surgery at [[Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center]] in NYC and better known to millions of Winfrey's viewers as "Dr. Oz", regularly appeared on Tuesdays during the 2008–2009 season. In 2009, Dr. Oz debuted ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]'' in first-run syndication. The series is co-produced by [[Harpo Productions]] and [[Sony Pictures Television]].

===Fridays Live===
A weekly live episode premiered in the show's 23rd season with a panel consisting of Winfrey, Gayle King, [[Mark Consuelos]], and [[Ali Wentworth]]. The panel discussed the week's news and highlighted events in the media and on the show.

In the 2009–10 season, Winfrey hosted this segment on her own. Fridays Live did not return for the show's 25th season.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/11242008/tv/oprahs_man_140446.htm |work=New York Post | title=Oprah's Man | first=Don | last=Kaplan | date=November 24, 2008}}</ref>

===No Phone Zone===
{{Main|No Phone Zone}}
In March 2010, Winfrey began a campaign to stop drivers from talking or texting on their cell phone in their vehicles while driving. This campaign was regularly noted near the beginning or at the end of episodes.<ref>[http://www.oprah.com/packages/no-phone-zone.html No Phone Zone] Retrieved May 14, 2010.</ref>

== Memorable moments ==
On November 10, 1986, during a show about sexual abuse, Winfrey revealed that she was raped by a relative when she was nine years old. Since this episode, Winfrey has used the show as a platform to help catch child predators, raise awareness, and give victims a voice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/The-Oprah-Shows-Most-Shocking-Moments_1 |title=Most Shocking Moments – Oprah's Sexual Abuse |date=April 15, 2011 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

[[Liberace]] appeared in the first season of the show on December 25, 1986. He performed a Christmas medley; Winfrey said it was "the most beautiful I've ever heard". Six weeks later he died of cardiac arrest due to [[congestive heart failure]] brought on by subacute [[encephalopathy]]. The episode was Liberace's final televised appearance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/In-Memoriam-Remembering-Oprah-Show-Guests/7 |title=In Memoriam – Liberace |date=May 16, 2011 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

The show had only been on the air for just six months when, in 1987, Winfrey traveled to [[Forsyth County, Georgia]], a community in which, for 75 years, no black person had lived. Winfrey brought attention to racial tensions in the area. The show was set up as a town hall meeting where residents expressed their divisive opinions on the matter. The meeting was becoming heated when one woman stood up and said:
{{Quote|I just hate to think that someone is going to get hurt before the people get some sense about them and talk about this and get it like it's supposed to be...black and white together in Forsyth County. There's no other way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/17-Headline-Making-Moments-on-The-Oprah-Show/ |title=Confronting Racism in Forstyh County Georgia |date=April 14, 2011 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>}}

The "Diet Dreams Come True" episode from November 15, 1988 has become one of the most talked-about moments in the history of show. After years of struggling to lose weight, Winfrey had finally succeeded in doing so. In July of that year, she had started the Optifast diet while weighing 212 pounds. By Fall, she weighed 145 pounds. To commemorate achieving her weight loss goals, Winfrey wheeled out a wagon full of fat to represent the 67 pounds she had lost on the diet. She showed off her slim figure in a pair of size 10 Calvin Klein jeans. However, after returning to real food she quickly gained back much of the weight she had lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprahs-Top-20-Moments |title=Oprah's Top 20 Moments |date=October 2005 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref> Winfrey now refers to that moment as her "ego in a pom pom salute."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahs-lifeclass/The-Complete-Webcast-of-Oprahs-Lifeclass-with-Eckhart-Tolle-Video |title=The Complete Webcast of Oprah's Lifeclass with Eckhart Tolle |date=October 10, 2011 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

While doing a show centered on women drug users in 1995, Winfrey opened up about her personal history with drug abuse:
{{Quote|I relate to your story so much. In my twenties, I have done this drug cocaine. I know exactly what you're talking about. It is my life's great big secret. It is such a secret because I realize that the public person that I have become, if the story were ever revealed, the tabloids would exploit it and what a big issue it would be. But I was involved with a man in my twenties who introduced me to cocaine. I always felt that the drug itself was not the problem, but that I was addicted to the man. I've often said over the years in my attempt to come out and say it, I have said many times, I did things in my twenties I was ashamed of, I've done things I've felt guilty about. And that is my life's great secret that's been held over my head. I understand the shame and I understand the guilt, I understand the secrecy, I understand all that.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ndsn.org/feb95/oprah.html |title=Oprah Winfrey Confesses Drug Use |date=February 1995 |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>}}

In 1996, Winfrey spoke with seven of the [[Little Rock Nine]] and three white former classmates who tormented the group on their first day of high school in 1957 as well as a student who had befriended them. Winfrey was grateful to have the remaining members of the Little Rock Nine on her show because she credits her success to those who have contributed to the [[Civil Rights Movement]] which paved the way for people like herself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Race-on-The-Oprah-Show-A-25-Year-Look-Back/2 |title=The Little Rock Nine |date=January 17, 2011 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

Comedian [[Ellen DeGeneres]] [[coming out|came out]] publicly as a lesbian during her appearance on the show in 1997 after appearing on a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover next to the headline "Yep, I'm gay." At the time, DeGeneres was the star of her own sitcom, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''. The episode brought Winfrey the most hate mail she had ever received.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahs-lifeclass/Ellen-DeGeneres-Stands-in-Her-Truth-Video_1 |title=Ellen DeGeneres Stands in her Truth |date=October 13, 2011 |work=Video |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

[[Clemantine Wamariya]] and her sister Claire appeared on the show in 2006 when Wamariya was selected as one of the winners of an essay contest held by Winfrey. It was revealed that the siblings had not seen their parents in 12 years after fleeing [[Rwanda]] during the 1994 genocide. Winfrey surprised the sisters by flying their family to Chicago for one of the most emotional reunions on the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Meet-the-Essay-Contest-Winners/5 |title=Meet the Essay Contest Winnders |date=May 25, 2006 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

In 2007, the Marines of the [[2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion|Second Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion Alpha Company]] and their naval corpsman, made the show their first stop after a seven-month tour on the front lines in Iraq. Winfrey welcomed the Marines with a big homecoming celebration where they were reunited with their loved ones on the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahs-lifeclass/Soldiers-Families-Reunited-Video |title=Soldiers' Families Reunited |date=November 2, 2011 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:200 Men, The Oprah Winfrey Show, 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Two hundred men who were molested stand together during a 2010 episode]]
On November 11, 2009, Charla Nash, who was mauled by her friend and employer Sandra Herold's pet chimpanzee [[Travis (chimpanzee)|Travis]], came to the show to speak out for the first time about the terrifying attack that took place just nine months prior. Nash wears a veil daily because the attack left devastating injuries to her face and she "doesn't want to scare people." During the show, she agreed to lift her veil for the first time in public.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Chimp-Attack-Victim-Charla-Nash-Shows-Her-Face/1 |title=Chimp Attack Victim Charla Nash Shows Her Face |date=November 11, 2009 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

While taping the show's 24th-season premiere on September 8, 2009, the entire audience of 21,000 people, gathered on Chicago's [[Magnificent Mile]], surprised Winfrey by breaking out into a synchronized dance set to [[The Black Eyed Peas]]' performance of "[[I Gotta Feeling]]" (with new lyrics congratulating Winfrey on her show's longevity). The dance had been choreographed and rehearsed for weeks by a core group of dancers, who taught it to the entire crowd earlier in the day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/entertainment/Oprahs-Kickoff-Party-Flash-Mob-Dance |title=Oprah's Kickoff Party Flash Mob Dance |date=September 10, 2009 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

During the farewell season, two hundred men who were molested came forward as part of a two-day event in 2010 to take a stand against sexual abuse. The men were joined by director and producer [[Tyler Perry]], who had also experienced sexual abuse. Winfrey hoped that the episode would help survivors suffering in silence release the shame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/showinfo/A-Two-Day-Oprah-Show-Event-200-Men-Who-Were-Molested-Come-Forward_1 |title=A Two-Day Oprah Show Event: 200 Adult Men Who Were Molested Come Forward |date=November 5, 2010 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

On January 24, 2011, Winfrey revealed that just before Thanksgiving 2010 she had discovered she has a half-sister. Winfrey decided to share the news on her show because she knew the story would eventually get out and wanted to be the first to address the matter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprahs-Family-Secret |title=Oprah's Family Secret |date=January 24, 2011 |work=Web |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

===Giveaways===
On the season premiere of 2004, every person in Winfrey's show audience was given a new [[Pontiac G6]] that was donated by [[General Motors]]{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}, worth about $8 million in total.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/06/john-oliver-debt/485834/ |first=J.

You get a car! Everybody gets a car!" For the premiere of the show's farewell season, the studio audience of 300 "ultimate fans" were rewarded by being given a trip to Australia with Winfrey (donated by Australian tourism bodies).<ref>{{cite news | last = Quinn | first = Karl | title = When Oprah gives, someone else pays |work=The Age | date = January 22, 2011 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/when-oprah-gives-someone-else-pays-20110121-1a012.html | access-date = January 22, 2011 | location=Melbourne, Australia}}</ref> Other giveaway shows included the annual [[Oprah's Favorite Things]] show, in which the studio audience received products Winfrey considered good Christmas gifts.

=== Controversies ===
In 1996, on a discussion of [[mad cow disease|Mad Cow Disease]], Winfrey stated that the disease fears had "stopped [her] cold from eating another burger!"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/21/us/talk-of-the-town-burgers-v-oprah.html|title=Talk of the Town: Burgers v.

The show was still producing new episodes at the time of the trial and could not go into reruns, so the production was forced to move to [[Amarillo, Texas]] for a period of approximately one month during the proceedings. A [[gag order]] meant Winfrey was not allowed to even mention the trial on her show. Winfrey was found not liable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mad-cow.org/~tom/oprah.html |title=Cattlemen Condemn False and Misleading Oprah Show |publisher=Mad-cow.org |access-date=May 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/television/oprah_transcript.html |title=Oprah's report on Mad Cow Disease |publisher=Mcspotlight.org |date=April 15, 1996 |access-date=May 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9802/26/oprah.verdict/|title=Oprah: 'Free speech rocks'.

A controversial episode, which aired in 2005 (though originally aired to little apparent notice in October 2003), saw guests discussing the sexual act of "[[Anilingus|rimming]]", igniting criticism. The [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] received a proliferation of complaints from angry parents whose children watched the show in an early-evening slot in many television markets. However, most FCC correspondents were prodded to write by [[Howard Stern]], a noteworthy target of the agency, as well as [[Jimmy Kimmel]], in an attempt to expose an FCC [[double standard]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Time Waster |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0504044oprah1.html |title=FCC Swamped With Oprah Indecency Complaints – May 4, 2004 |publisher=Thesmokinggun.com |access-date=May 26, 2011}}</ref>

During the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]] campaign, Winfrey was criticized for apparently declining to invite [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] vice presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] to her show until after the election.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09062008/news/nationalnews/palin_clubbed_by_oprah_snub_127736.htm | work=New York Post | title=Palin Clubbed By Oprah Snub | first=Clemente | last=Lisi | date=September 6, 2008}}</ref>

Winfrey's program was criticized for featuring [[alternative medicine]] advocates such as [[Suzanne Somers]] and [[MMR vaccine controversy|vaccine denialist]] [[Jenny McCarthy]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/21/arts/television/21watch.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Fine Art of Quitting While She's Ahead | first=Alessandra | last=Stanley | date=November 21, 2009 | access-date=May 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Allen |first=Arthur |date=May 6, 2009 |title=Say It Ain't So, O |work=Slate |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2009/05/say_it_aint_so_o.html}}</ref>

In the lead-up to Winfrey's tour of Australia, the show was heavily criticized for airing a segment sponsored by the [[McDonald's Corporation]]<ref name="theaustralian.com.au">{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/when-oprah-educates-yanks-on-our-hip-mccafes-its-the-dollar-talking/story-e6frg8mf-1225966038233 |title=When Oprah educates Yanks on our 'hip' McCafes, it's the dollar talking |work=The Australian |date=December 6, 2010 |access-date=May 26, 2011 |first1=Amanda |last1=Meade |first2=Lara |last2=Sinclair}}</ref><ref name="news.com.au">{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/with-oprah-fever-rising-what-impression-will-oprahs-guesst-get-of-australia/story-e6frfmyi-1225966220960 | work=news.com.au | first=Daniela | last=Elser | title=Coffee houses in a froth over Oprah's McCafe sell-out | date=December 6, 2010}}</ref> in which it was claimed by Australian TV personality [[Carrie Bickmore]] that Australians liked to hang out at "hip [[McCafé]]s".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/The-Australian-Way-Video |title=The Australian Way – Video |publisher=Oprah.com |access-date=May 26, 2011}}</ref> This depiction of [[Culture of Australia|Australian culture]] was greeted with surprise by many Australians,<ref name="theaustralian.com.au"/> and anger throughout the Australian coffee industry, which claimed the statements did not accurately reflect the industry, painted the Australian coffee drinker in a bad light, and expected that the industry would be negatively affected by the statements.<ref name="news.com.au"/> In the same episode, [[McDonald's products]] were handed out to the studio audience.

==Final season==
Early in its twelfth season, Winfrey confessed she was "exhausted" and considered quitting.<ref name="jet">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMQDAAAAMBAJ&q=jet+1997+oprah+staying+on+tv&pg=PA58 |title=Cover Story: Oprah Winfrey Reveals the Real Reason Why She Stayed on TV |journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |date=November 24, 1997 |access-date=May 26, 2011|page=58}}</ref> However, while making the 1998 movie ''[[Beloved (1998 film)|Beloved]]'', Winfrey then admitted that it brought her back to her responsibility as an admired black woman with a great deal of power and influence. She realized that being in such a position within the media industry, she could make a positive difference in people's lives.  Winfrey was once again inspired to continue to help people take better control of their destinies, hence her slogan, "Live Your Best Life".

{{quote|I made the decision ... in the midst of doing ''Beloved''. I was doing some scenes—''Beloved'' is about an ex-slave, and during that process of doing that I connected to really what slavery had meant, and my own personal ancestry and history connected it to a way I have never before from reading all about Black history and, you know, talking to relatives. And I realized that I had no right to quit coming from a history of people who had no voice, who had no power, and that I have been given this—this blessed opportunity to speak to people, to influence them in ways that can make a difference in their lives, and to just use that.<ref name="jet"/>}}

On January 15, 2008, [[Discovery Communications]], Harpo Productions, and Winfrey announced a joint venture to establish a new cable channel in 2009, known as the [[Oprah Winfrey Network]] (OWN).<ref name="wp-ownannounce">{{cite web|title=Discovery, Winfrey to Team Up On Network|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/15/AR2008011501562.html|website=Washington Post|access-date=April 29, 2017}}</ref> In November 2008, it was reported that, during a conference call, Discovery Communications CEO [[David Zaslav]] stated that Winfrey did not intend to renew her contracts for ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' beyond the 2010-11 season.

On November 20, 2009, Winfrey officially announced that ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' would conclude in 2011, after its 25th and final season.

{{quote|I've been asked many times during this farewell season, 'Is ending the show bittersweet?' Well, I say all sweet. No bitter. And here is why: Many of us have been together for 25 years. We have hooted and hollered together, had our aha! moments, we ugly-cried together and we did our gratitude journals. So I thank you all for your support and your trust in me. I thank you for sharing this yellow brick road of blessings. I thank you for tuning in every day along with your mothers and your sisters and your daughters, your partners, gay and otherwise, your friends and all the husbands who got coaxed into watching ''Oprah''. And I thank you for being as much of a sweet inspiration for me as I've tried to be for you. I won't say goodbye. I'll just say...until we meet again. To God be the glory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/The-Oprah-Winfrey-Show-Finale_1/11|title=Oprah Signs Off After 25 Years of The Oprah Winfrey Show|publisher=Oprah}}</ref>}}

After the show's final episode, reruns of the show continue to air until September 2011, when the show's timeslot began to be occupied by other syndicated or local programs selected by individual stations. Several stations that carried the show in the 4:00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot began carrying local news programs at that time, with a handful of stations debuting these newscasts the day after the final episode aired; as a result, the show's reruns did not air in the normal timeslot in some areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/tvspy/kgo-to-add-4pm-news-after-oprah-says-goodbye/11458|title=KGO to add 4pm News after Oprah says goodbye|website=www.adweek.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>
