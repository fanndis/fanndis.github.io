The '''57th Primetime Emmy Awards''' were held on Sunday, September 18, 2005 and was hosted by [[Ellen DeGeneres]]. The ceremony was broadcast on [[CBS]]. [[BBC America]] received its first major nomination this year.

The ceremony, which aired three weeks after [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit, featured a mini-telethon for [[Habitat for Humanity]] and gave DeGeneres more opportunity to use the ceremony to somberly remember the victims of the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]. Opening the ceremony was the famous 1970's band [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] with a comedic version of "[[September (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|September]]", in collaboration with [[The Black Eyed Peas]]. The ceremony featured tributes to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-TV anchor [[Peter Jennings]] (who died seven weeks earlier) presented by rival anchors [[Dan Rather]] and [[Tom Brokaw]], and to talk show host [[Johnny Carson]] (who died on January 23, 2005) by close friend and ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'' host [[David Letterman]]. Also, the show featured ''Emmy Idol'', five segments in which famous TV stars performed popular TV theme songs in a format like ''[[American Idol]]''.

''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' became the first comedy to have its [[Everybody Loves Raymond (season 9)|final season]] win the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]] since ''[[Barney Miller]]'' in [[34th Primetime Emmy Awards|1982]]. The CBS comedy series also tied for the lead in major nominations and wins with ten and three, respectively. Freshman series ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' became just the second series to earn three nominations in a lead acting category, joining ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' which had three nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] for four separate years. In the drama field, new series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' won [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]].

Actress [[Angela Lansbury]] received her eighteenth and most recent nomination. However, she failed to win causing her record losing streak to be extended.
