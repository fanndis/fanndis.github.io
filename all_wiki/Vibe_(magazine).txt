'''''Vibe''''' is an American music and entertainment [[magazine]] founded by producer [[Quincy Jones]]. The publication predominantly features [[R&B]] and [[hip hop music]] artists, actors and other entertainers. After shutting down production in the summer of 2009, it was purchased by the private equity investment fund [[InterMedia Partners]], then issued bi-monthly with double covers and a larger online presence. The magazine's target demographic is predominantly young, urban followers of hip hop culture. In 2014, it discontinued its print version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/media/story/2014/09/spin-media-lays-off-19-kills-vibe-print-edition-002834 |title=Spin Media lays off 19, kills Vibe print edition |last=Sterne |first=Peter |date=September 11, 2014 |website=[[Politico]] |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}</ref>

Trio [[TLC (band)|TLC]] were photographed for the cover in firefighters' gear, referencing the fact that member [[Lisa Lopes]] burned down the house of then-boyfriend and [[National Football League|NFL]] star [[Andre Rison]]. The first non-photograph cover of ''Vibe'' was an illustration of late singer [[Aaliyah]] by well-known artist/illustrator Alvaro; this was [[Aaliyah]]'s first appearance on the cover as well. Other famous cover subjects are [[Trey Songz]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Amerie]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Keyshia Cole]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[The Fugees]], [[Eminem]], [[T.I.]], [[R.

''Vibe'' made a consistent effort to feature models of all ethnicities in these pages. Former editor Emil Wilbikin was frequently credited with styling those pages and keeping fashion in the forefront of the magazine's identity during the early 2000s. Many clothing brands created or linked to hip hop celebrities, such as [[Sean Combs]]' [[Sean John]], Nelly's [[Apple Bottoms]], and [[G-Unit]] by [[50 Cent]] found plenty of exposure in ''Vibe''{{'}}s pages.

In the September 2003 issue commemorating ten years of publication, the magazine created different covers using black and white portraits of its most popular cover subjects. It also contained "The Vibe 100: The Juiciest People, Places and Things of the Year".

Many successful writers and editors contributed to the publication, including [[Alan Light]], [[Jeff Chang (journalist)|Jeff Chang]], [[Dream Hampton]], Cheo Hodari Coker, Kevin Powell, [[Erica Kennedy]], Sacha Jenkins, Noah Callahan-Bever and [[Miles Marshall Lewis]].

An incident occurred at the 2004 ''Vibe Awards'' taping at the [[Santa Monica Airport]] hangar, in which [[G-Unit]] rapper [[Young Buck]] stabbed 26-year-old Los Angeles native, Jimmy James Johnson after Johnson approached [[Dr. Dre]] under the pretense of asking for an autograph, and then assaulted him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1493786/warrant-issued-for-young-buck-in-vibe-awards-stabbing/ |title=Warrant Issued For Young Buck In Vibe Awards Stabbing |last=Moss |first=Corey |date=November 16, 2004 |website=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}</ref> Young Buck later pleaded no contest to a charge of "assault likely to produce great bodily harm," and was sentenced to three years' probation and 80 hours of community service.

The actual final four included [[Ludacris]], [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]], Eminem, and Jay Z. The last two rappers standing were Eminem and Jay Z, with Eminem eventually garnering 69% of the votes for the victory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1596451/eminem-is-the-best-rapper-alive-according-to-vibe-poll/ |title=Eminem Is The Best Rapper Alive, According To Vibe Poll |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |date=October 7, 2008 |website=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}</ref> When Em heard the news, he stated: "It's obviously an honor to have won the fans' support by being voted the Best Rapper Alive. I don't think that there is any one rapper that is simply the best though. Everyone who was in consideration and many others are the best at certain things, and at what they do. But since ''Vibe''{{'}}s offering the distinction, hell yeah I'll accept!"

==Other editions==

''[[VIBE Vixen|Vibe Vixen]]'' was a magazine geared towards female readers of ''Vibe'' magazine that covered beauty, dating, entertainment, fashion, and societal issues for "urban minded females". The magazine was initially released in fall of 2004, and sales were considered successful enough for the magazine to be issued on a quarterly basis.
