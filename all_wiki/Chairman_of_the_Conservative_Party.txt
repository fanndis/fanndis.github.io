The '''Chairman of the Conservative Party''' in the [[United Kingdom]] is responsible for party administration and overseeing the [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters]], formerly [[Conservative Central Office]].

When the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] are in government, the officeholder is usually a member of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] holding a [[sinecure]] position such as [[Minister without portfolio|Minister without Portfolio]]. Deputy or Vice Chairmen of the Conservative Party may also be appointed, with responsibility for specific aspects of the party (most notably local government, women or youth). The Conservative Party is currently co-chaired by [[Amanda Milling]],<ref>https://twitter.com/Conservatives/status/1228003822649401344</ref> who was appointed on 13 February 2020, and [[Ben Elliot]], who has been Co-Chairman since July 2019. [[Lee Rowley]] MP is Deputy Chairman.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lee Rowley (@Lee4NED) {{!}} Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/Lee4NED|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref>

The role was created in 1911 in response to the Conservative party's defeat in the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|second 1910 general election]]. The position is not subject to election, as it is given by the party leader.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Conservatives - A History | publisher=Bantam Press | author=Harris, Robin | year=2011 | location=London | isbn=9780593065112 | quote=(p. 249) After the second election defeat of 1910 there was an unstoppable pressure for an enquiry into the party's failures. A committee recommended that two new posts be created  - that of party treasurer and that of chairman of the party (enjoying 'Cabinet rank'). ... Balfour accepted the changes but tried to reduce the status of the chairman, a position which he significantly (and permanently) re-titled 'chairman of the party organization'. He also concealed, as long as he could, the 'Cabinet rank' pledge. Finally he appointed a rather junior but, as it turned out, vigorous and assertive Birmingham member of parliament, [[Arthur Steel-Maitland]], to the chairmanship.}}</ref>
