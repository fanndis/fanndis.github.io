The '''Nobel Peace Prize''' is one of the five [[Nobel Prize]]s established by the will of Swedish industrialist, inventor, and armaments (military weapons and equipment) manufacturer [[Alfred Nobel]], along with the prizes in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]], [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]], and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]]. Since March 1901,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1901/address.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102153041/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1901/address.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 January 2007|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1901|work=[[Nobel Prize|NobelPrize]]|date=1972|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> it has been awarded annually (with some exceptions) to those who have "done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of [[peace congress]]es".<ref>"Nobel Peace Prize", ''The Oxford Dictionary of Twentieth Century World History''</ref>

In accordance with Alfred Nobel's will, the recipient is selected by the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]], a five-member committee appointed by the [[Parliament of Norway]]. The 2020 prize will be awarded in the [[University of Oslo Faculty of Law|Atrium]] of the [[University of Oslo]], where it was also awarded 1947–1989; the [[Abel Prize]] is also awarded in the building.<ref>[https://www.uniforum.uio.no/nyheter/2020/09/nobels-fredspris-i-aulaen.html I år skal Nobels fredspris utdeles på UiO]</ref> The prize was previously awarded in [[Oslo City Hall]] (1990–2019), the [[Norwegian Nobel Institute]] (1905–1946), and the [[Storting building|Parliament]] (1901–1904).

Due to its political nature, the Nobel Peace Prize has, for most of its history, been the [[Nobel Prize controversies#Peace|subject of numerous controversies]].

==Background==

Nobel died in 1896 and he did not leave an explanation for choosing [[peace]] as a prize category. As he was a trained chemical engineer, the categories for [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] were obvious choices. The reasoning behind the peace prize is less clear. According to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, his friendship with [[Bertha von Suttner]], a peace activist and later recipient of the prize, profoundly influenced his decision to include peace as a category.<ref name="Why Norway?">{{cite web

It is unclear why Nobel wished the Peace Prize to be administered in Norway, which was [[personal union|ruled]] in [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]] at the time of Nobel's death. The Norwegian Nobel Committee speculates that Nobel may have considered Norway better suited to awarding the prize, as it did not have the same militaristic traditions as [[Sweden]].  It also notes that at the end of the 19th century, the [[Norwegian parliament]] had become closely involved in the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]'s efforts to resolve conflicts through mediation and arbitration.<ref name="Why Norway?"/>

===Selection===
Nominations are considered by the Nobel Committee at a meeting where a shortlist of candidates for further review is created.  This shortlist is then considered by permanent advisers to the Nobel institute, which consists of the institute's Director and the Research Director and a small number of Norwegian academics with expertise in subject areas relating to the prize.  Advisers usually have some months to complete reports, which are then considered by the committee to select the laureate.  The Committee seeks to achieve a unanimous decision, but this is not always possible. The Nobel Committee typically comes to a conclusion in mid-September, but occasionally the final decision has not been made until the last meeting before the official announcement at the beginning of October.<ref name="selection">{{cite web| title =How are Laureates selected?| publisher =The Norwegian Nobel Committee| url =http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/nomination_committee/selection-process/| accessdate =10 September 2009| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090831032749/http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/nomination_committee/selection-process| archive-date =31 August 2009| df =dmy-all}}</ref>

Since 1990, the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony is held at [[Oslo City Hall]].

From 1947 to 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held in the Atrium of the [[Faculty of Law, University of Oslo|University of Oslo Faculty of Law]], a few hundred meters from Oslo City Hall. Between 1905 and 1946, the ceremony took place at the [[Norwegian Nobel Institute]].

==Criticism==

In 2011, a feature story in the Norwegian newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'' contended that major criticisms of the award were that the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] ought to recruit members from professional and international backgrounds, rather than retired members of parliament; that there is too little openness about the criteria that the committee uses when they choose a recipient of the prize; and that the adherence to Nobel's will should be more strict. In the article, Norwegian historian Øivind Stenersen argues that Norway has been able to use the prize as an instrument for nation-building and furthering Norway's foreign policy and economic interests.<ref name=Aftenposten20111004>{{cite news|last=[[Arild Aspøy|Aspøy, Arild]]|title=Fredsprisens gråsoner|newspaper=Aftenposten|date=4 October 2011|page=4|language=no|quote=Nobelkomiteen bør ta inn medlemmer med faglig og internasjonal bakgrunn... som gjøre en like god jobb som pensjonerte stortingsrepresentanter.}}</ref>

In another 2011 ''Aftenposten'' opinion article, the grandson of one of Nobel's two brothers, Michael Nobel, also criticised what he believed to be the politicisation of the award, claiming that the Nobel Committee has not always acted in accordance with Nobel's will.<ref>{{cite news | last = Nobel | first = Michael | title = I strid med Nobels vilje | newspaper = Aftenposten | location = Oslo, Norway | language = no | date = 9 December 2011| url = http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/I-strid-med-Nobels-vilje-6717623.html | accessdate = 12 December 2011}}</ref>
