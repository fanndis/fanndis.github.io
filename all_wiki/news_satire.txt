'''News satire''' is a type of [[parody]] presented in a format typical of mainstream [[journalism]], and called a [[satire]] because of its content. News satire has been around almost as long as journalism itself, but it is particularly popular on the [[World Wide Web|web]], with websites like [[The Onion]], where it is relatively easy to mimic a legitimate news source. News satire relies heavily on [[irony]] and [[Deadpan|deadpan humor]].

Two slightly different types of news satire exist. One form uses satirical commentary and sketch comedy to comment on real-world news events, while the other presents wholly fictionalized news stories.

==In history== 

Author [[Mark Twain|Samuel Clemens]] (Mark Twain) was employed as a newspaper reporter before becoming famous as a novelist, and in this position he published many satirical articles. He left two separate journalism positions, Nevada (1864) fleeing a challenge to duel<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinenevada.org/samuel_clemens |title=Samuel Clemens |publisher=Onlinenevada.org |date=2009-07-30 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> and San Francisco fleeing outraged police officials because his satire and fiction were often taken for the truthful accounts they were presented as. Ironically, the accuracy of many newspaper and autobiographical accounts used to follow the early life of Samuel Clemens are in doubt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nsla.nv.gov/Myth_002 |format=PDF |title=Myth # 2 - Mark Twain Flees Nevada |first1=Guy |last1=Rocha |first2=Dennis |last2=Myers |accessdate=2013-08-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820064409/http://nsla.nv.gov/Myth_002/ |archive-date=2014-08-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Newspapers still print occasional news satire features, in particular on [[April Fools' Day]]. This news is specifically identified somewhere in the paper or in the next day as a joke.

In 1933 and 1934, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] released a series of ten one-reel theatrical shorts called ''[[Goofy Movies]]'', which included "Wotaphony Newsreel," a [[newsreel]] parody that paired actual footage with a mocking, [[deadpan]] narration.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142329/ Goofy Movies Number Ten (1934)]</ref><!--<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142326/ Goofy Movies Number Nine (1934)]</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142323/ Goofy Movies Number Eight (1934)]</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142327/ Goofy Movies Number Seven (1934)]</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142328/ Goofy Movies Number Six (1934)]</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142324/ Goofy Movies Number Five (1934)]</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142325/ Goofy Movies Number Four (1934)]</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142330/ Goofy Movies Number Three (1934)]</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142331/ Goofy Movies Number Two (1934)]</ref>--><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134693/ Goofy Movies Number One (1933)]</ref>

Also in 1934, halfway through a [[Kraft Music Hall]] radio show, Dean Taylor ("Others collect the news, Dean makes it!") narrated a fake newsreel which began with a report on the New York Giants and Philadelphia Phillies being cancelled due to bad weather, and baseball season being rescheduled to when farmers need rain.<!-- File missing (34 minutes into clip)

==On television==
{{globalize|date=November 2010}}
News satire has been prevalent on television since the 1960s, when it enjoyed a renaissance in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] with the "Satire Boom", led by such luminaries as [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], [[David Frost]], [[Eleanor Bron]], and [[Dudley Moore]], and the television program ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''. In the [[United States]], the [[NBC]] network adapted this program and also produced its own content, from the "news" segment of ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]'', to the still-running ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' mock newscast segment "[[Weekend Update]]". [[Cable television]] got into the [[United States cable news|cable news]] act with [[Home Box Office]]'s ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]'' in the mid-1980s.

In the 2000s, Comedy Central's ''[[The Daily Show]]'' became an icon of the American political satire genre, as [[Jon Stewart]] delved into opinionated political criticism. Its spinoff, [[Stephen Colbert]]'s ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', also enjoyed a high level of popularity during its 9-year run.

The 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey found that ''Daily Show'' viewers were better informed than those who relied solely on conventional network news,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/Downloads/Political_Communication/naes/2004_03_late-night-knowledge-2_9-21_pr.pdf |title=National Annenberg Election Survey |publisher=Annenberg Public Policy Center |date=2004-09-21 |accessdate=2014-08-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210055617/http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/Downloads/Political_Communication/naes/2004_03_late-night-knowledge-2_9-21_pr.pdf |archive-date=2012-02-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Steven Young of ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' compares the trust and influence that long-time host [[Jon Stewart]] enjoyed to that of CBS anchor [[Walter Cronkite]] in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Steve|title=The 1974 Cronkite|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+1974+CRONKITE+JON+STEWART+IS+DRAWING+BIG+LAUGHS+BY+TELLING+THE...-a0122340122|accessdate=16 August 2014|work=Los Angeles Daily News|date=2004-09-20}}</ref> However, a study published in the ''Journal of Communication'' suggests that news entertainment shows such as ''The Daily Show'' or ''The Colbert Report'' may not be as influential in teaching voters about political issues and candidates as was previously thought. Researchers from Ohio State University have found reasons to discount how effective these shows are in informing the general public. People watching television news learned more about a candidate's position on issues and about political procedures compared to those watching the news entertainment shows, while news entertainment shows primarily taught viewers about a candidate’s personal background.<ref>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00388.x Just Laugh! You Don’t Need to Remember: The Effects of Entertainment Media on Political Information Acquisition and Information Processing in Political Judgment] Wiley Online Library, Retrieved on September 15, 2018.</ref>

After the success of ''The Daily Show'', [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] launched its own news satire program in February 2007 with the title of ''[[The 1/2 Hour News Hour]]''. Its creator describes it as "The Daily Show for conservatives", but it was canceled within a few months. Fox News then launched the more successful series ''[[Red Eye (TV series)|Red Eye]]'' which ran from February 6, 2007 to April 7, 2017. As of 2017, news satire in the United States remains popular, especially in [[late night television]]; [[late-night talk show]]s often incorporate elements of news satire. Current American programs known primarily for their news satire include those hosted by former correspondents for ''The Daily Show'' ([[John Oliver]]'s ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver|Last Week Tonight]]'', [[Samantha Bee]]'s ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee|Full Frontal]]'', and ''The Daily Show'' itself under [[Trevor Noah]]'s tenure), as well as [[Bill Maher]]'s ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher|Real Time]]''.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], several news satires have been created, most famously the works of [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]]. Shows such as the radio series ''[[On the Hour]]'' and its television version ''[[The Day Today]]'' parodied news programs very accurately, so they were almost believable and could have been confused with actual news programs, if it was not for the fake stories reported. Morris went on to continue this and several other themes in ''[[Brass Eye]]'', one of the most controversial series on British television, especially after one episode broadcast mocked the way the news covered stories about [[pedophilia]]. Previous news satire shows in Britain include: ''[[The Late Edition]]'' with [[Marcus Brigstocke]], on digital station [[BBC Four]], which was heavily influenced by ''The Daily Show''; ''[[News Knight with Sir Trevor McDonald]]'', which parodied news differently by using an actual newsreader as the host; and ''[[Broken News]]'', which featured several sketches of different news channels blending into each other.

As of 2018, current British news-related programs that have been described as satire include: ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' and ''[[Mock the Week]]'' on the [[BBC]]; [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Last Leg]]''; [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s ''[[Newzoids]]''; and [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]]'s ''[[Unspun with Matt Forde]]''.

Recent news satire television series in Australia include [[Working Dog Productions]]' ''[[Frontline (Australian TV series)|Frontline]]'', [[Shaun Micallef]]'s ''[[Newstopia]]'', and the many programs created by [[The Chaser]] since 2001. As of 2017, current programs of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] include ''[[Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell]]'' and ''[[The Weekly with Charlie Pickering]]''.

In Canada, ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' is an ensemble news satire show with four anchors on [[CBC Television|CBC]]. The ''[[Rick Mercer Report]]'' is a spinoff of ''22 Minutes'' with former anchor [[Rick Mercer]], and is also shown on CBC. [[CBC Radio One]] features ''[[This Is That]]'', an improvised news satire program which mimics the style of actual CBC Radio public affairs programs. The 1960s series ''[[This Hour Has Seven Days]]'', although primarily a real newsmagazine, included some satirical features in its format, such as political humor songs by actress and singer [[Dinah Christie]]. On French-language television networks in Quebec, noted news satire shows have included ''[[La Fin du monde est à 7 heures]]'', ''[[Et Dieu créa... Laflaque]]'' and ''[[Infoman]]''. On the Internet, noted satire sites include ''The Lapine'' and ''[[The Beaverton]]''.

In Germany, [[heute-show]] ([[ZDF]]), and formerly [[Wochenshow]] (on [[SAT.1]]) and [[Freitag Nacht News]] (on [[RTL Television|RTL]]) are popular news satires on TV.

The [[Egypt]]ian show ''[[El Bernameg]]'', hosted by [[Bassem Youssef (television host)|Bassem Youssef]] (on [[Capital Broadcast Center]] 2011-13 and [[MBC MASR]] from 2014 on), is modeled on ''The Daily Show''. Launched in the wake of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], it has been quite popular, but also a source of tremendous controversy, as Youssef has repeatedly been under investigation by the authorities for his willingness to poke fun at powerful people.

In France, [[Rendez-Vous avec Kevin Razy]] on [[Canal+]] hosted by the comedian [[Kévin Razy]] between 2017 and 2019 was modeled on ''Last Week Tonight'' and 'The Tonight Show' with a band.

==Online==
News satire has been posted on the web almost since its inception, with ''[[The Onion]]'' foremost among recognized news satire sites due to its enduring and profitable business model.<ref>{{cite news|author=Geoff Keighley Business 2.0 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/08/28/bus2.feat.onion.site/index.html |title=CNN.com - The Onion: Funny site is no joke - Aug. 29, 2003 |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= 2003-08-28|accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> The content of the website, which started in 1996, is syndicated through mainstream media sites such as [[CNN]] and [[CNET]]. Today there are hundreds of news satire sites online.

Because interesting stories are often emailed and can quickly become separated from their point of origin, it is not uncommon for news satire stories to be picked up as real by the [[News media|media]], as happened with a ''[[Faking News]]'' story about a lawsuit against Axe by an Indian man after having failed to attract a girl.<ref>{{cite web|author=r3vz says |url=http://www.fakingnews.com/2009/10/unable-to-attract-even-a-single-girl-frustrated-man-sues-axe/ |title=Unable to attract even a single girl, frustrated man sues Axe |publisher=Faking News |date= 2009-10-19|accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> Additionally, a parody post on Al Sharpton's parody News Groper blog was quoted as if real by MSNBC.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/08292007/business/msnbc_coms_fumble.htm |title=Msnbc.Com'S Fumble |publisher=NYPOST.com |date=2007-08-29 |accessdate=2012-02-24 |first=Keith J. |last=Kelly}}</ref> Another satire publication, ''The Giant Napkin'', published an article about a man literally fighting his house fire with more fire, a story taken seriously by several social networking sites. That [[Google News]] accepts news satire sources helps contribute to this phenomenon; while Google News does mark such stories with a "satire" tag, not all readers notice the tag; moreover, sometimes satirical sources may not carry the tag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/news/bin/answer.py?answer=40264&topic=8867 |title=Blogs, satire, and press release sites |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> At least one site, ''thespoof.com'', relies on user-generated content in a [[Web 2.0]] manner.

Some websites like ''Literally Unbelievable post'' the genuine and shocked reactions of individuals who believe the satirical articles are real. The reactions are taken from [[social media]] websites, such as [[Facebook]], in which users can directly comment on [[Hyperlink|links]] to the article's source.

A plethora of news satire sites participate in a hosted community site, which additionally runs its own satire news feed on HumorFeed. HumorFeed is notable for its relatively high standards of admission and active community involvement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} At present,{{When|date=May 2015}} over 60 sites are contributing members, at least eight of which have published books and two of which publish regular hard-copy periodicals.
