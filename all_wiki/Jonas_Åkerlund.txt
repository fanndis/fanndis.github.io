'''Hans Uno Jonas Åkerlund''' ({{IPA-sv|hɑːns ˈʉ̌ːnʊ ˈjûːnas ˈôːkɛˌɭɵnd|lang}}; born 10 November 1965) is a Swedish film director, screenwriter, music video director, and drummer. His video for [[Madonna]]'s song "[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]" won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Music Video, Short Form]], and a record seven awards at [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], including the [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].

In 2008 he won another Grammy Award, this time around for "Best Long Form Music Video" for another work with Madonna – directing "The Confessions Tour" DVD. In 2014 he won this Grammy Award again (that meanwhile changed the name to "Best Music Film"), this time for "Live Kisses", a [[Paul McCartney]] concert film. Jonas Åkerlund, [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] and Bob Smeaton are the only directors to have won this award twice sharing the record for most wins in this category (check here all winners and nominees of [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film]]).

==Career==
Åkerlund was briefly a member of the Swedish [[black metal]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] from 1983 to 1984 - before their career took off. He also directed Candlemass' first video "Bewitched". He first found fame as the main video director for [[Roxette]]. In 1997, he directed the acclaimed video for [[The Prodigy]]'s "[[Smack My Bitch Up]]", which sparked controversy due to its depiction of drug use, violence, and nudity. In 1998, he worked with [[Madonna]] for the song "[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]", and has since worked with acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[U2]], [[Blink-182]], [[P!nk]], [[Rammstein]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. He directed the music video for the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' "Try, Try, Try", from which a short film entitled ''Try'' was spawned. He was also the designer and photographer for the [[Roxette]] album ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' in 2001. In 2002, his first full-length film, ''[[Spun]]'', debuted.

Åkerlund directed commercials for Swedish clothing retailer MQ and the re-imagining of the Devo song "Watch Us Work It" used in [[Dell Computers]] commercials. He is a long-time collaborator of Madonna, having worked on such music videos as "Music", "American Life" (which was pulled due to its graphic content and the [[Iraq War]]), and "Jump". He also directed her documentary film ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'' and her concert special ''[[The Confessions Tour (album)|The Confessions Tour: Live from London]]''. Among his more recent works were the controversial pornographic music video for [[Rammstein]]'s "[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]", the video for the song "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]" by [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Beyoncé]], "[[Moves like Jagger]]" by [[Maroon 5]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Duran Duran]]'s single "Girl Panic!".<ref name="MTV gaga">{{cite web|last=Wigler|first=Josh|title=The Man Behind Lady Gaga's 'Telephone' Video: Jonas Akerlund|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633818/man-behind-lady-gagas-telephone-video-jonas-akerlund.jhtml|publisher=MTV|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>
