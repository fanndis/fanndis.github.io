Journalist [[Kurt Loder]] described the track as "the [[black music|blackest record]] to ever creep into the white pop charts since [[Ray Charles]]'s gospel-styled '[[What'd I Say]]' that previous summer."{{sfn|Gulla|2007|p=176}}{{sfn|Turner|1986|p=79}} Another single from the duo, "[[It's Gonna Work Out Fine]]", reached No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 2 on the R&B chart in 1961, earning them a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Song|Best Rock and Roll Performance]].<ref name=":4" /> Notable singles released between 1960 and 1962 included the R&B hits "[[I Idolize You]]", "[[Poor Fool (Ike & Tina Turner song)|Poor Fool]]", and "[[Tra La La La La]]".

After the release of "A Fool in Love", Ike created the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, which included the Kings of Rhythm and a girl group called [[the Ikettes]] backing Tina.

{{quote|''Nam Myoho Renge Kyo'' is like a song. In the [[Soka Gakkai International|Soka Gakkai]] tradition we are taught how to sing it. It is a sound and a rhythm and it touches a place inside you.

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'':<blockquote>Turner merged sound and movement at a critical turning point in rock history, navigating and reflecting back the technological innovations of a new pop-music era in the 60s and 70s. She catapulted herself to the forefront of a musical revolution that had long marginalized and overlooked the pioneering contributions of African American women and then remade herself again at an age when most pop musicians were hitting the oldies circuit. Turner's musical character has always been a charged combination of mystery as well as light, melancholy mixed with a ferocious vitality that often flirted with danger.<ref name="theguardian1" /></blockquote>
