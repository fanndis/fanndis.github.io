===Pre-colonization===
Before Europeans, humans inhabited the area in and around Madison for about 12,000 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://morgridge.wiscweb.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/02/History_of_Madison.pdf|title=A History of Madison|last=|first=|date=|website=morgridge.wiscweb.wisc.edu|access-date=2018-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221134602/https://morgridge.wiscweb.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/02/History_of_Madison.pdf|archive-date=December 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1800, the Madison area was Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) Country. The Native Americans called this place Taychopera (Ta-ko-per-ah), meaning "land of the four lakes" (Mendota, Monona, Waubesa, and Kegonsa). [[Effigy mounds]], which had been constructed for ceremonial and burial purposes over 1,000 years earlier, dotted the rich prairies around the lakes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS2904|title=Life in Early Madison|date=2012-06-27|website=Wisconsin Historical Society|access-date=2018-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221041537/https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS2904|archive-date=December 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Creation===
Madison's European origins begin in 1829, when former federal judge [[James Duane Doty]] purchased over a thousand acres (4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of swamp and forest land on the isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona, with the intention of building a city in the Four Lakes region. He purchased 1,261 acres for $1,500. When the [[Wisconsin Territory]] was created in 1836 the territorial legislature convened in [[Belmont, Wisconsin]]. One of the legislature's tasks was to select a permanent location for the territory's capital. Doty lobbied aggressively for Madison as the new capital, offering [[American bison|buffalo]] robes to the freezing legislators and promising choice Madison lots at discount prices to undecided voters.<ref>Mollenhoff, David V. (2003) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NwrIKM0rBd4C&q=buffalo+robes&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q=buffalo+robes&f=false Madison, a History of the Formative Years] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116173314/https://books.google.com/books?id=NwrIKM0rBd4C&q=buffalo+robes&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q=buffalo+robes&f=false |date=January 16, 2017 }}'' Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0-299-19980-0}}.

Doty named his city Madison for [[James Madison]], the fourth President of the U.S. who had died on June 28, 1836, and he named the streets for the other [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|39 signers]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].<ref>Historic Madison, Inc., [http://www.historicmadison.org/Madison%27s%20Past/madisonspast.html Madison's Past – Early History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623093154/http://www.historicmadison.org/Madison's%20Past/madisonspast.html |date=June 23, 2012 }}</ref> Although the city existed only on paper, the territorial legislature voted on November 28, 1836 in favor of Madison as its capital, largely because of its location halfway between the new and growing cities around [[Milwaukee]] in the east and the long established strategic post of [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien]] in the west, and between the highly populated [[lead]] mining regions in the southwest and Wisconsin's oldest city, [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], in the northeast.<ref>[https://www.wicourts.gov/courts/supreme/hearingroom.htm Supreme Court, History: The Supreme Court Hearing Room] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112101826/https://www.wicourts.gov/courts/supreme/hearingroom.htm |date=January 12, 2018 }} Wisconsin Court System.</ref><ref name="briefhistory">{{cite web |title=Madison, Wisconsin - A Brief History |url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS2401 |website=Wisconsinhistory.org |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |accessdate=January 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110014319/https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS2401 |archive-date=January 10, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The cornerstone for the Wisconsin capitol was laid in 1837, and the legislature first met there in 1838. On October 9, 1839, [[Kintzing Prichette|Kintzing Prichett]] registered the [[plat]] of Madison at the registrar's office of the then-territorial [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]].<ref name="platted1839">{{cite book |title=Reports of cases argued and determined in the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin|volume=6 |publisher=E.E.

When Wisconsin became a state in 1848, Madison remained the capital, and the following year it became the site of the University of Wisconsin (now [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]). The [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee & Mississippi Railroad]] (a predecessor of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]]) connected to Madison in 1854. Madison incorporated as a city in 1856, with a population of 6,863, leaving the unincorporated remainder as a separate [[Madison (town), Wisconsin|Town of Madison]].<ref>[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=header;pview=hide;id=WI.MadDane ''Madison, Dane County and Surrounding Towns''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724115343/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=header;pview=hide;id=WI.MadDane |date=July 24, 2014 }}, Madison: Wm.

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Madison served as a center of the [[Union Army]] in Wisconsin. The intersection of Milwaukee, East Washington, Winnebago, and North Streets is known as Union Corners, because a tavern there was the last stop for Union soldiers before heading to fight the Confederates. [[Camp Randall]], on the west side of Madison, was built and used as a training camp, a military hospital, and a prison camp for captured [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers. After the war ended, the Camp Randall site was absorbed into the University of Wisconsin and [[Camp Randall Stadium]] was built there in 1917. In 2004 the last vestige of active military training on the site was removed when the stadium renovation replaced a firing range used for [[ROTC]] training.

===1960s and 1970s===
[[File:Frontal.jpg|thumb|[[Nottingham Cooperative]], founded in 1971, is one of the [[housing cooperatives]] formed in Madison in the early 1970s in already existing buildings.]]
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Madison [[counterculture]] was centered in the neighborhood of Mifflin and Bassett streets, referred to as "Miffland". The area contained many three-story apartments where students and counterculture youth lived, painted murals, and operated the co-operative grocery store, the Mifflin Street Co-op. Residents of the neighborhood often came into conflict with authorities, particularly during the administration of Republican mayor [[William Dyke|Bill Dyke]]. Dyke was viewed by students as a direct antagonist in efforts to protest the [[Vietnam War]] because of his efforts to suppress local protests. The annual [[Mifflin Street Block Party]] became a focal point for protest, although by the late 1970s it had become a mainstream community party.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, thousands of students and other citizens took part in [[Opposition to the Vietnam War#Growing protests|anti-Vietnam War marches and demonstrations]], with more violent incidents drawing national attention to the city and UW campus. These include:
* the 1967 student protest of [[Dow Chemical Company]], with 74 injured;
* the 1969 strike to secure greater representation and rights for African-American students and faculty, which resulted in the involvement of the Wisconsin [[United States National Guard|Army National Guard]];

Tom Bates wrote the book ''Rads'' on the subject ({{ISBN|0-06-092428-4}}). Bates wrote that Dyke's attempt to suppress the annual [[Mifflin Street Block Party]] "would take three days, require hundreds of officers on overtime pay, and engulf the student community from the nearby Southeast Dorms to [[Langdon Street Historic District|Langdon Street's]] fraternity row. [[Tear gas]] hung like heavy fog across the Isthmus." In the fracas, student activist [[Paul Soglin]], then a city [[alderman]], was arrested twice and taken to [[County jail|jail]]. Soglin was later elected mayor of Madison, serving several times.

==Geography==
[[File:Madison Wisconsin.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern Madison taken from the International Space Station (ISS)]]
[[File:Lake Monona Madison, WI.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Lake Monona]] from [[Monona Terrace]]]]
Madison is located in the center of Dane County in south-central Wisconsin, {{convert|77|mi|km|0}} west of [[Milwaukee]] and {{convert|122|mi|km|0}} northwest of [[Chicago]]. The city completely surrounds the smaller [[Madison (town), Wisconsin|town of Madison]], the city of [[Monona, Wisconsin|Monona]], and the [[Village (Wisconsin)|villages]] of [[Maple Bluff, Wisconsin|Maple Bluff]] and [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin|Shorewood Hills]]. Madison shares borders with its largest suburb, [[Sun Prairie, Wisconsin|Sun Prairie]], and three other suburbs, [[Middleton, Wisconsin|Middleton]], [[McFarland, Wisconsin|McFarland]], and [[Fitchburg, Wisconsin|Fitchburg]]. Other suburbs include the city of [[Verona, Wisconsin|Verona]] and the villages of [[Cottage Grove, Wisconsin|Cottage Grove]], [[DeForest, Wisconsin|DeForest]], and [[Waunakee, Wisconsin|Waunakee]] as well as [[Mount Horeb, Wisconsin|Mount Horeb]], [[Oregon, Wisconsin|Oregon]], [[Stoughton, Wisconsin|Stoughton]], and [[Cross Plains, Wisconsin|Cross Plains]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|94.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|76.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|17.24|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}</ref>

The city is sometimes described as ''The City of Four Lakes'', comprising the four successive lakes of the [[Yahara River]]: [[Lake Mendota]] ("Fourth Lake"), [[Lake Monona]] ("Third Lake"), [[Lake Waubesa]] ("Second Lake") and [[Lake Kegonsa State Park|Lake Kegonsa]] ("First Lake"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=9293&term_type_id=2&term_type_text=Places&letter=F|title=Dictionary of Wisconsin History: Four Lakes|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|access-date=October 24, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523184708/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=9293&term_type_id=2&term_type_text=Places&letter=F|archive-date=May 23, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> although Waubesa and Kegonsa are not actually in Madison, but just south of it. A fifth smaller lake, [[Lake Wingra]], is within the city as well; it is connected to the Yahara River chain by Wingra Creek. The Yahara flows into the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]], which flows into the [[Mississippi River]]. Downtown Madison is located on an [[Madison Isthmus|isthmus]] between Lakes Mendota and Monona. The city's trademark of "Lake, City, Lake" reflects this geography. The city's lowest elevation is Lake Monona, at 845 ft (257.5 m). The highest elevation is located along S. Pleasant View Rd on the far westside of the city, atop a portion of a terminal moraine of the Green Bay Lobe of the Wisconsin Glaciation, at 1192 ft (363.3 m). 

===Neighborhoods===
Local identity varies throughout Madison, with over 120 officially recognized neighborhood associations, such as the east side Williamson-Marquette Neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmadison.com/residents/Community/index.cfm|title=City of Madison Website, Communities and Neighborhoods|access-date=March 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307231044/http://www.cityofmadison.com/residents/Community/index.cfm|archive-date=March 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://madison.com/ct/news/local/writers/steven_elbow/madison-s-williamson-marquette-neighborhood-named-one-of-nation-s/article_0175770c-9f42-532c-b9d2-9fac08f86d1b.html|title=Madison's Williamson-Marquette neighborhood named one of nation's top 10|last=Times|first=Steven Elbow {{!}} The Capital|work=madison.com|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718030525/https://madison.com/ct/news/local/writers/steven_elbow/madison-s-williamson-marquette-neighborhood-named-one-of-nation-s/article_0175770c-9f42-532c-b9d2-9fac08f86d1b.html|archive-date=July 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Historically, the north, east, and south sides were [[blue-collar worker|blue collar]] while the west side was [[white-collar worker|white collar]], and to a certain extent this remains true. Students dominate on the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] campus and to the east into downtown, while to its south and in [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin|Shorewood Hills]] on its west, faculty have been a major presence since those neighborhoods were originally developed. The turning point in Madison's development was the university's 1954 decision to develop its experimental farm on the western edge of town; since then, the city has grown substantially along suburban lines.

===Major commercial areas===
====Hilldale====
The Hilldale area comprises the Hill Farms neighborhood, Sunset Village Neighborhood, and part of the suburb of [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin|Shorewood Hills]].

===Politics===
[[File:Wis-capitol.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wisconsin State Capitol]] atop Madison's [[Madison Isthmus|isthmus]]]]
City voters have supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in national elections in the last half-century, and a liberal and progressive majority is generally elected to the city council. Detractors often refer to Madison as "77 square miles surrounded by reality" a phrase coined by former Wisconsin Republican governor [[Lee S. Dreyfus]], while campaigning in 1978.<ref name="moe">{{cite book |title=Surrounded by Reality |last=Moe |first=Doug |year=2005 |publisher=Jones Books |location=Madison, Wisconsin  |isbn=978-0-9763539-3-5 |page=xiii }}</ref> In 2013, there was a motion in the city council to turn Dreyfus' humor into the official city "punchline," but it was voted down by the city council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibmadison.com/In-Business-Madison/July-2013/Madison-to-stay-real-City-Council-rejects-Soglins-proposed-slogan/|title=Madison to stay real: City Council rejects Soglin's proposed slogan|work=ibmadison.com|access-date=July 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314191611/http://www.ibmadison.com/In-Business-Madison/July-2013/Madison-to-stay-real-City-Council-rejects-Soglins-proposed-slogan/|archive-date=March 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city's voters are generally much more liberal than voters in the rest of Wisconsin. For example, 76% of Madison voters voted against a 2006 state [[Wisconsin Referendum 1|constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Fair Wisconsin News Release | url=http://www.fairwisconsin.com | accessdate=2007-04-14 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191102212558/https://fairwisconsin.com/ | archive-date=November 2, 2019 | url-status=dead }}</ref> even though the ban passed statewide with 59% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news | title=Key Ballot Measures | website=Cnn.com | url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/ballot.measures/ | accessdate=2007-04-16 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6JOEavBsk?url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/ballot.measures/ | archive-date=September 4, 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1992, a local third party, [[Progressive Dane]], was founded. City policies supported in the Progressive Dane platform have included an [[inclusionary zoning]] ordinance, later abandoned by the mayor and a majority of the city council, and a city minimum wage. The party holds several seats on the Madison City Council and Dane County Board of Supervisors, and is aligned variously with the Democratic and Green parties.

The ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'' (weekday circulation: ~95,000; Sundays: ~155,000) is published in the mornings, while its sister publication, ''[[The Capital Times]]'' (Thursday supplement to the Journal) is published online daily, with two printed editions a week. Though jointly operated under the name [[Capital Newspapers]], the ''Journal'' is owned by the national chain [[Lee Enterprises]], and the ''Times'' is independently owned. ''Wisconsin State Journal'' is the descendant of the ''Wisconsin Express'', a paper founded in the Wisconsin Territory in 1839. ''The Capital Times'' was founded in 1917 by William T. Evjue, a business manager for the ''State Journal'' who disagreed with that paper's editorial criticisms of Wisconsin Republican Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] for his opposition to U.S. entry into [[World War I]].

The free weekly alternative newspaper ''[[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]]'' (weekly circulation: ~65,000) was founded in Madison in 1976.

Two student newspapers are published during the academic year, ''[[The Daily Cardinal]]'' (Mon-Fri circulation: ~10,000) and ''[[The Badger Herald]]'' (Mon-Fri circulation: ~16,000).

Madison is associated with [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|"Fighting Bob" La Follette]] and the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive movement]]. La Follette's magazine, ''[[The Progressive]]'', founded in 1909, is still published in Madison. It is a left-wing periodical that may be best known for the attempt of the U.S. government in 1979 to suppress one of its articles before publication. The magazine eventually prevailed in the landmark First Amendment case, ''[[United States v. The Progressive, Inc.]]'' During the 1970s, there were two radical weeklies published in Madison, known as ''TakeOver'' and ''Free for All'', as well as a Madison edition of the ''[[Bugle (newspaper)|Bugle-American]]'' [[underground newspaper]].
