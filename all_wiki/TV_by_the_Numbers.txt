'''TV by the Numbers''' was a website devoted to collecting and analyzing television ratings data in the United States. It was a part of [[Nexstar Media Group]]'s [[Zap2it]] television news/listings site.

==History==
An Internet and statistical analyst, Robert Seidman had previously worked for [[IBM]] and [[Charles Schwab Corporation|Charles Schwab]], and published an online newsletter about the Internet and [[AOL]] before founding TV by the Numbers; Bill Gorman had been an AOL executive until 1998, and had read Seidman's column.<ref name=austin>{{cite news |url=http://www.austin360.com/television/website-has-the-odds-on-shows-survival-1265668.html?printArticle=y |title=Website has the odds on shows' survival |date=2011-02-18 |last=Roe |first=Dale |work=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |accessdate=2011-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329012213/http://www.austin360.com/television/website-has-the-odds-on-shows-survival-1265668.html?printArticle=y |archive-date=2012-03-29 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=ssrc>{{cite web|url=http://mediaresearchhub.ssrc.org/tv-by-the-numbers |title=TV by the Numbers |publisher=[[Social Science Research Council]] |accessdate=2011-03-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502045204/http://mediaresearchhub.ssrc.org/tv-by-the-numbers |archivedate=May 2, 2011 }}</ref> Friends since the early 1990s when they met near [[Washington, D.C.]],<ref name=about/> both were fond of television, as Gorman loved numbers and Seidman enjoyed statistics relating to it; the subject of television ratings data entered into one of their conversations. Gorman was dismayed at being unable to find other blogs devoted solely to television data, and after a [[Google]] search confirmed this, he and Seidman thought of the idea for a website devoted solely to the subject.<ref name=austin/><ref name=ssrc/><ref name=indy>{{cite web |url=http://www.indybizshow.com/2010/10/tv-by-the-numbers-bill-gorman/ |title=Bill Gorman: TVbyTheNumbers.com |date=2010-10-01 |last=Saulsbury |first=Sean |publisher=Indybizshow.com |accessdate=2011-03-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006012634/http://www.indybizshow.com/2010/10/tv-by-the-numbers-bill-gorman/ |archivedate=2010-10-06 }}</ref> In Gorman's words, while there were sites devoted to disseminating certain subjects, "there was no site that did the same thing for the television industry. That is, compile the numbers in a way, and analyze them in a way, that consumers would understand".<ref name=indy/> Gorman elaborated in a 2010 interview:

<blockquote>We try to focus on publicly available facts. We're not breaking any news. We're not interviewing people to try to get the last bit of juicy gossip. We focus on publicly available, either ratings or financial information, and what that likely means for your favorite show. Whether they're coming back or going away.<ref name=indy/></blockquote>

On June 30, 2009, in response to pressure from [[Nielsen Media Research]], TV by the Numbers made large changes to their archives. The main ratings archives no longer go past 2 weeks prior to the date a reader accesses them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2009/06/30/site-changes-inspired-by-nielsen/21734/|title=Site changes (inspired by Nielsen)|last=Seidman|first=Robert|publisher=TV by the Numbers|date=June 30, 2009|accessdate=February 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616060022/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2009/06/30/site-changes-inspired-by-nielsen/21734/|archive-date=June 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On November 10, 2010, TV by the Numbers announced that they were partnering with TV news website [[Zap2it]]. As a result, the website's URL changed to a [[subdomain]] of the zap2it.com domain. In addition, Zap2it features such as TV listings began to appear on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/11/10/tvbythenumbers-partners-with-zap2it/71630/|title=TVbytheNumbers Partners with Zap2it|last=Seidman|first=Robert|publisher=TV by the Numbers|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=February 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116044813/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/11/10/tvbythenumbers-partners-with-zap2it/71630/|archive-date=January 16, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In response to ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} decision in 2011 to start charging for access to online content, Gorman wrote an article stressing his website will remain free.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/03/17/unlike-the-new-york-times-tv-by-the-numbers-will-not-be-putting-up-a-pay-wall/86128 |title=Unlike The New York Times, TV by the Numbers Will Not Be Putting Up A Pay Wall |date=2011-03-17 |last=Gorman |first=Bill |publisher=TV by the Numbers |accessdate=2011-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322170144/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/03/17/unlike-the-new-york-times-tv-by-the-numbers-will-not-be-putting-up-a-pay-wall/86128 |archive-date=2011-03-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In January 2012, Gorman and Seidman expressed interest in hiring writers to do the day-to-day writing on their site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/09/help-wanted/115830/|title=Help Wanted!|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|date=January 9, 2012|accessdate=July 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123170042/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/09/help-wanted/115830/|archive-date=January 23, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> On February 12, 2012, they announced that Sara Bibel and Amanda Kondolojy would be joining the website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/12/please-welcome-amanda-sara/119522/|title=Please Welcome Amanda & Sara!|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|date=February 12, 2013|accessdate=July 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516041714/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/12/please-welcome-amanda-sara/119522/|archive-date=May 16, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On January 31, 2020, the website's staff released a statement declaring TV By The Numbers to be inactive starting the very next day, February 1, 2020.<ref name=inactive /> The staff bid goodbye and thanked readers.<ref name=inactive /> As of August 2020, its URL redirects to Zap2It's TV listings service.

==Impact==
According to one source, much of the information Gorman and Seidman had access to was not readily available to the media, and thus their efforts to analyze the data led to many "savvy readers" becoming interested in the workings of the ratings process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airlockalpha.com/node/7863/scifriday-dont-panic-over-ratings.html |title=SciFriday: Don't Panic Over Ratings |date=October 2, 2010 |last=Hinman |first=Michael |work=[[Airlock Alpha]] |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119102346/http://airlockalpha.com/node/7863/scifriday-dont-panic-over-ratings.html |archive-date=November 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===''Harry's Law''===
TV by the Numbers received criticism from several facets of the television industry for their ratings analyses. ''[[Harry's Law]]'' star [[Kathy Bates]] publicly bashed the website's ideas about ratings and their symbol "The Cancellation Bear", in an interview for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. She stated, "Some of these people are just so stupid. I don’t even get it....

===Renew/Cancel Index===
The Renew/Cancel Index is a mathematical formula developed and used by Gorman to predict whether scripted series on the Big 5 broadcast networks would be renewed or cancelled that season.

During the [[2007 in American television|2007]]–[[2008 in American television|2008]] broadcast season, Gorman experimented with different ways to predict the fates of television series. They were all unsuccessful, until close to the end of the season when he developed the Renew/Cancel Index.<ref name="rcindex">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2008/08/27/the-renewcancel-index-our-predictor-of-show-futures/4800/|title=The Renew/Cancel Index, Our Predictor Of Show Futures|last=Gorman|first=Bill|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=August 27, 2008|accessdate=July 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227102442/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2008/08/27/the-renewcancel-index-our-predictor-of-show-futures/4800/|archive-date=December 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Renew/Cancel Index differs from Gorman's previous attempts in that it compares a series's average ratings to the average ratings for their own network, as opposed to a basic numerical hierarchy or comparing ratings to an overall average from all the networks. Gorman formulates the numbers by dividing a series's season-to-date ratings average by the season-to-date average of all the scripted series on that network (in the latter half of the season, Gorman uses only numbers since that January for season-to-date numbers, as that seems to help renewal predictions). The resulting number (rounded to the nearest hundredth) shows how a series's average relates to the network's average (which always comes out to 1.00).<ref name="rcindex"/>

Using these numbers, Gorman then creates a grading scale. There are five levels on the scale: Certain to be Renewed, Likely to be Renewed, Toss-Up, Likely to be Cancelled, and Certain to be Cancelled. Series above 1.00 are almost always certain to be renewed, while series directly below that are likely to be renewed. The distinction between likely to be renewed and toss-up is at 0.90. Although this number was 0.92 in the original incarnation,<ref name="rcindex"/> it has since changed.<ref name="improved">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/09/11/new-improved-the-renew-cancel-index-returns-next-week/103276/|title=New & Improved! The Renew / Cancel Index Returns!|last=Gorman|first=Bill|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=September 11, 2011|accessdate=July 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722111201/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/09/11/new-improved-the-renew-cancel-index-returns-next-week/103276/|archive-date=July 22, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The toss-up range continues down to 0.75, when the likely to be cancelled level starts.<ref name="improved"/> There is no clear-cut line between the likely to be cancelled and certain to be cancelled levels, but Gorman has said that discerning between likely/certain cancellations is usually just trivial, and thus unimportant. Friday series, being on a [[Friday night death slot|lesser-viewed night]], are graded differently. The toss-up range is between 0.55 and 0.70, with the numbers above it being likely/certain renewals and the numbers below it being likely/certain cancellations.<ref name="improved"/>

Gorman does not always follow the index numbers religiously. For example, series that are within a season of reaching the 88-episode mark (the usual requirement for [[Broadcast syndication#Strip/daily syndication|stripped syndication]]) usually get a large boost. In Fall 2011, Gorman stated that no series that fell into this category would be ranked less than a toss-up.<ref name="improved"/> In Fall 2013, he even made the point of putting most series in this category as Certain to be Renewed despite the fact that many of them had not aired yet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/24/abc-once-upon-a-time-revenge-are-certain-to-be-renewed/203691/ |title=ABC: 'Once Upon A Time' & 'Revenge' Are Certain To Be Renewed |last=Gorman |first=Bill |work=TV by the Numbers |publisher=Zap2it |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925143416/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/24/abc-once-upon-a-time-revenge-are-certain-to-be-renewed/203691/ |archive-date=September 25, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/24/cbs-person-of-interest-two-broke-girls-are-certain-to-be-renewed/203696/ |title=CBS: 'Person Of Interest' & '2 Broke Girls' Are Certain To Be Renewed |last=Gorman |first=Bill |work=TV by the Numbers |publisher=Zap2it |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925144305/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/24/cbs-person-of-interest-two-broke-girls-are-certain-to-be-renewed/203696/ |archive-date=September 25, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/24/cw-hart-of-dixie-is-certain-to-be-renewed/203699/ |title=CW: 'Hart Of Dixie' Is Certain To Be Renewed |last=Gorman |first=Bill |date=September 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925144310/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/24/cw-hart-of-dixie-is-certain-to-be-renewed/203699/ |archive-date=September 25, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/24/fox-new-girl-is-certain-to-be-renewed/203684/ |title=Fox: 'New Girl' Is Certain To Be Renewed |last=Gorman |first=Bill |work=TV by the Numbers |publisher=Zap2it |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925143427/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/24/fox-new-girl-is-certain-to-be-renewed/203684/ |archive-date=September 25, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/24/nbc-grimm-is-certain-to-be-renewed/203687/ |title=NBC: 'Grimm' Is Certain To Be Renewed |last=Gorman |first=Bill |work=TV by the Numbers |publisher=Zap2it |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925163744/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/24/nbc-grimm-is-certain-to-be-renewed/203687/ |archive-date=September 25, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On the other hand, he does not take internal issues (contract disputes, scheduling arguments, etc.) into account.

The Renew/Cancel index is updated with a new article every Tuesday, from the beginning of the broadcast season in late September to the dates of the network [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentations in mid-May.

===Bubble Watch===
Seidman created the Bubble Watch which, similarly to the Renew/Cancel Index, aims to predict based upon ratings data which television series will be canceled and which will be renewed.<ref name=austin/> It uses a scale for sorting series that is similar to the Renew/Cancel Index, with On the Bubble being identical to Gorman's Toss-Up. Series above the bubble are in the Renewal Predicted category, while series below the bubble are in the Cancellation Predicted category.

Unlike the Renew/Cancel Index, the Bubble Watch does not use a mathematical formula. Additionally, it takes the possibilities of future ratings into account, something that Gorman strictly does not do with his index. In the end, though, the predictions of the Bubble Watch and the Renew/Cancel Index are usually very similar.

In October 2012, Seidman decided to stop publishing the Bubble Watch and replaced it with a simple list of the renewed and the cancelled series. He did not disclose his reasons, but said that it might or might not be temporary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/07/renewcancel-the-road-so-far-through-october-7-2012/151864/|title=Renew/Cancel: The Road So Far (Through October 7, 2012)|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=October 7, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519112554/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/07/renewcancel-the-road-so-far-through-october-7-2012/151864/|archive-date=May 19, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many readers were disappointed and expressed their disappointment to Seidman. Seidman recognized that and reinstated the Bubble Watch on November 4, 2012. He stated that readership levels were basically the same for the Bubble Watch and its temporary replacement, but he wanted to "give the vocal minority who really cares about the table format the table format they asked for."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/11/04/renewcancel-recap-bubble-watch-is-back-and-cant-possibly-be-wrong-about-fringe-this-season-or-can-it/156130/|title=Renew/Cancel Recap: Bubble Watch is Back and Can't Possibly Be Wrong About 'Fringe' This Season!

The Bubble Watch is updated with a new article every Sunday, during the same period as the Renew/Cancel Index. Seidman wrote every update from the Bubble Watch's inception until May 2013. He has taken a break for an unspecified period of time, and longtime reader and occasional contributor Tom Shaw took his place in September 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/22/bubble-watch-is-the-mindy-project-safe-from-cancellation-in-the-short-term-bad-neighbors/204144/ |title=Bubble Watch: Is 'The Mindy Project' Safe From Cancellation In The Short Term? + Bad 'Neighbors' |last=Shaw |first=Tom |work=TV by the Numbers |publisher=Zap2it |date=September 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925022915/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/22/bubble-watch-is-the-mindy-project-safe-from-cancellation-in-the-short-term-bad-neighbors/204144/ |archive-date=September 25, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Bubble Watch did not return for the 2014–15 season, however Tom Shaw has contributed to Renew/Cancel Index posts and there was a one-week edition of the Bubble Watch in December.

====Scripted Cable Series Renew/Cancel Status====
Readers of the Renew/Cancel Index and the Bubble Watch inquired many times to Seidman and Gorman about why they did not predict the renewal chances of cable series. In response, Gorman and Seidman explained that the cable networks were not limited to the strict structure of the broadcast networks. This results in them being much more erratic in renewals and cancellations, and thus too hard to predict accurately.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/08/11/question-why-isnt-there-a-renewcancel-index-for-summer-cable-shows/|title=Question: Why Isn't There a Renew/Cancel Index for Summer Cable Shows?|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=August 11, 2011|accessdate=August 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630225929/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/08/11/question-why-isnt-there-a-renewcancel-index-for-summer-cable-shows/|archive-date=June 30, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/11/05/why-doesnt-the-cancellation-bear-chase-cable-shows/156231/|title=Why Doesn't The Cancellation Bear Predict Cable Renewals & Cancellations?|last=Gorman|first=Bill|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=November 5, 2012|accessdate=August 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917143024/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/11/05/why-doesnt-the-cancellation-bear-chase-cable-shows/156231/|archive-date=September 17, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Seidman decided to make a compromise of sorts and made a simple list of the renewed and the cancelled cable series. Called the Scripted Cable Renew/Cancel Status, its first post was published on November 7, 2012.<ref name="cable">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/11/07/scripted-cable-show-renewcancel-status-alpha-test/156549/|title=Scripted Cable Show Renew/Cancel Status List|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=November 7, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004055835/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/11/07/scripted-cable-show-renewcancel-status-alpha-test/156549/|archive-date=October 4, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Scripted Cable Renew/Cancel Status explicitly did not predict the fates of television series. It only stated their status. If a series had been cancelled or had been renewed for an upcoming season, it would have been stated in the list. If a series's future beyond the season that was currently airing (or, if the series was on hiatus, the season that had just been previously airing) had not been officially declared by the network, there would have been a blank spot in that series's row on the list.<ref name="cable"/> The Scripted Cable Renew/Cancel Status did not include unscripted series, children's and teens' series, late night series on the [[Adult Swim]] network, and series airing on minor broadcast networks (such as PBS). These exclusions were necessary to keep the list short.<ref name="cable"/>

The Scripted Cable Renew/Cancel Status was published every Saturday, a total of 12 times. On March 30, 2013, Seidman announced he would stop publishing the posts, citing low readership as the reason for the discontinuation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/03/30/the-scripted-cable-show-renewcancel-status-list-has-been-canceled/175600/|title=The Scripted Cable Show Renew/Cancel Status List...Has Been Canceled|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=March 30, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802234600/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/03/30/the-scripted-cable-show-renewcancel-status-list-has-been-canceled/175600/|archive-date=August 2, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>
