==Playing style, coaches and sponsors==
[[File:Caroline Wozniacki 01.jpg|thumb|right|Wozniacki won her first WTA title at Nordic Light Open Stockholm 2008]]
Wozniacki's playing style centres on "the defensive aspects of tennis with her anticipation, movement, agility, footwork and speed all first-rate and key parts of her game." She also anticipates serves with aggressive footwork.<ref>[http://www.footfault.net/2010/08/06/caroline-wozniacki-an-analysis/ Caroline Wozniacki: An Analysis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024071053/http://www.footfault.net/2010/08/06/caroline-wozniacki-an-analysis/ |date=24 October 2013 }}. 6 August 2010.</ref> Her two-handed backhand is one of her best weapons as she is capable of turning defence into offence, most notably the backhand down-the-line. Her defensive playing style had her contemporaries label her a counter-puncher;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontennis.com/news/viewpoint-wozniacki-cant-just-be-counter-puncher |title=Viewpoint: Wozniacki can't just be counter-puncher |last=Martin|first=James |date=22 March 2010 |work=[[Tennis (magazine)|Tennis]] |accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref> sometimes, she was referred to as a [[Pusher (tennis)|pusher]] by critics. Wozniacki responded to criticism along these lines by saying "If I don’t have a weapon, then what do the others have? Since I’m No. 1, I must do something right." Following her retirement, ''[[The Guardian]]'' described Wozniacki as "one of the most defensive players ever to reach No. 1", noting her use of the moonball, and stated that her main strengths were her mental fortitude and competitive drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/07/defiant-caroline-wozniacki-will-end-turbulent-career-with-head-held-high|title=Wozniacki wants last hurrah after bravery loses out to brittleness|last=Carayol|first=Tumaini|date=7 December 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=14 February 2020}}</ref> Despite Wozniacki's excellent footwork and anticipation, and a strong backhand, especially down the line, Wozniacki's forehand remained a weakness throughout her career, due to its lack of depth, power and speed. As noted in the Guardian, "people questioned why her serve could scale 118mph and yet her forehand could not crack open an egg".

Wozniacki's father, Piotr, was her primary coach since she was 14.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wozniacki-is-happy-to-keep-it-in-the-family-7768762.html |title=Wozniacki is happy to keep it in the family |date=20 May 2012 |work=The Independent |first=Paul |last=Newman |accessdate=8 September 2014 }}</ref> Throughout the years, she was coached by [[Sven Groeneveld]] through the Adidas Player Development Program.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/sports/tennis/caroline-wozniacki-a-former-no-1-is-seeking-stability.html?pagewanted=all |title=Former No. 1 Turns to Father for Help |newspaper=The New York Times |date=13 January 2013 |first=Christopher |last=Clarey |accessdate=8 September 2014 }}</ref> She was briefly coached by Ricardo Sanchez and [[Thomas Johansson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/tennis/french-open-caroline-wozniacki-confident-as-new-coach-joins-team-1-2331345 |title=French Open: Caroline Wozniacki confident as new coach joins team |work=The Scotsman |date=1 June 2012 |accessdate=8 September 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2012/10/report-wozniacki-thomas-johansson-split/39968/#.VA1MdfldUrU |title=Report: Wozniacki, Thomas Johansson split |publisher=Tennis.com |date=31 October 2012 |first=Matt |last=Cronin |accessdate=8 September 2014 }}</ref> In October 2013, she hired [[Thomas Högstedt]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/tennis/beyond-baseline/2013/10/31/caroline-wozniacki-hires-thomas-hogstedt-as-coach |title=Caroline Wozniacki hires Thomas Hogstedt as her coach |date=31 October 2013 |work=Sports Illustrated |first=Courtney |last=Nguyen |accessdate=8 September 2014 }}</ref> but parted ways in January 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/11/us-tennis-wozniacki-idUSBREA2A20J20140311 |title=Wozniacki postpones search for coach as dad rejoins team |date=11 March 2014 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=8 September 2014 }}</ref> In the same month, she hired [[Michael Mortensen]], but cut ties with him in March 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/tennis/beyond-baseline/2014/03/13/caroline-wozniacki-splits-with-michael-mortensen |title=Report: Caroline Wozniacki splits with coach Michael Mortensen |work=Sports Illustrated |date=13 March 2014 |first=Courtney |last=Nguyen |accessdate=8 September 2014 }}</ref> Since then, Wozniacki decided to be coached again by her father Piotr for the rest of her career.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Junior career==
Wozniacki had a career-high junior ranking of No. 2 in the world. She made her debut on the [[ITF Junior Circuit]],  the premier 18-and-under junior tour that is run by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF), in October 2003 at 13 years and 3 months old. During her first month, she entered two Grade 5 events in Denmark, the lowest-level tournament on the tour. Wozniacki reached the final at both singles events, winning the second over compatriot [[Hanne Skak Jensen]]. With this success, she moved up to Grade 3 and Grade 4 tournaments, winning her first four singles events of 2004. Her win streak of five tournaments and 27 matches came to an end in April with a semifinal loss to [[Latisha Chan]] at the International Juniors Championships in Manila, her first event outside of Scandinavia as well as her first Grade 1 event. From this point on, Wozniacki only competed in Grade A and Grade 1 events, the two highest-level tournaments. She made her Grade A debut at [[2004 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] before turning 14, losing her first main draw match to [[Bojana Bobusic]]. Towards the end of the year, Wozniacki won her first Grade A title at the [[Osaka Mayor's Cup]].<ref name="itf-junior-singles-activity">{{cite web |title=Caroline Wozniacki Juniors Singles Activity |url=https://www.itftennis.com/en/players/caroline-wozniacki/800254714/den/jt/s/activity |publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]] |accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref><ref name="itf-junior-doubles-activity">{{cite web |title=Caroline Wozniacki Juniors Singles Activity |url=https://www.itftennis.com/en/players/caroline-wozniacki/800254714/den/jt/d/activity |publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]] |accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref>

In 2006, she was the top seed at the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]] ([[2006 Australian Open – Girls' Singles|junior girls' singles]]), but lost the final to eighth-seeded [[Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova]]. She was seeded second with partner [[Anna Tatishvili]] in the doubles tournament, but the pair was knocked out in the semifinals by the French-Italian pair of [[Alizé Cornet]] and [[Corinna Dentoni]], who were seeded 8th. In February at the [[2006 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships and the Cellular South Cup|Memphis]], she reached her first WTA Tour quarterfinal, beating [[Kristina Brandi]] and [[Ashley Harkleroad]] before losing to third-seeded [[Sofia Arvidsson]] of Sweden.
