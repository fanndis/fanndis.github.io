'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[Norway]] on 11 and 12 September 2005.<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen]] & Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1438 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref> The result was a victory for the opposition centre-left [[Red-Green Coalition (Norway)|Red-Green Coalition]], which received 48.0% of the votes and won 87 out of 169 seats, dominated by the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]]'s 61 seats. The three-party centre-right government coalition won 44 seats and the right wing [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] won 38, becoming the largest opposition party. Voter turnout was 77.1%, an increase of 2 percentage points compared to the 2001 elections.

==Campaign==
Before the election, [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]] [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]] led a [[coalition government]] consisting of the [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]] (38 seats in parliament), [[Christian Democratic Party of Norway|Christian People's Party]] (22 seats and supplied the prime minister) and the [[Venstre (Norway)|Liberals]] (2 seats), with the conditional support of the right-wing [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]]. Between them, the three main parties of the coalition held 62 seats in the outgoing 165-seat Storting. The Progress Party held an additional 26, giving the four parties a [[majority]] when acting together.

Divisions within the coalition led to the temporary withdrawal of support by the Progress Party in November 2004, in response to what they saw as the government's underfunding of [[hospital]]s; an agreement was later reached. The government also attracted criticism for its handling of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], in which several Norwegians died, with the prime minister admitting to mistakes in his government's delayed reaction to the disaster.

The question of [[private school]]s was controversial in 2005, with the opposition [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]], [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] and [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] rejecting the government's plan to allow schools other than those offering an "alternative education", or those founded on [[religion|religious beliefs]], to become private.

Amidst a decline in the personal popularity of the prime minister, [[opinion poll]]s in early 2005 indicated a clear lead for the Labour Party. Its leader, [[Jens Stoltenberg]], was prime minister from March 2000 to October 2001, and enjoyed widespread public support in the run-up to the election. Polling suggests that the Labour, Socialist Left and Centre parties could form a [[Red-Green Coalition (Norway)|red–green coalition]], which would command a majority in the Storting. Labour and Socialist Left have pledged to maintain their allegiance with the Centre party even if the latter were not necessary to obtain a majority.

In June the leader of the Progress Party, [[Carl I. Hagen]], said his party would not support a new coalition if Bondevik re-emerges as the prime minister after the election, implicitly pointing at [[Erna Solberg]], leader of the conservative party as a better candidate.

A week before the elections, the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] experienced a fall in popularity on recent polls. The [[Venstre (Norway)|Liberals]] and [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]] gained popularity on the polls. As of 11 September 2005, the day before the election, the opinion polls indicated a dead run between the red-green coalition and the right wing.

[[Advance poll|Advance voting]] was possible from 10 August to 9 September 2005. 452,488 votes were cast in advance, a decrease of approx 52,000 since the 2001 election.

===Winners===
[[File:2005 Norwegian parliamentary election results by county.svg|thumb|250px|Election results by county]]
*The red-green coalition was the winner of the election and formed a majority government, with [[Jens Stoltenberg]] as prime minister, on 17 October 2005, as soon as a national budget for 2006 had been proposed by the old government.
*The [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] obtained a result that brought it back into the position of "the largest Norwegian party, not just the largest of many middle-sized ones".
*The [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] obtained its best result ever, surpassing the Conservatives by a large margin and becoming almost as large as the parties in the [[Kjell Magne Bondevik|Bondevik]] government combined.
*The [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] gained a substantial number of seats in its most successful election since 1965. The large number of additional seats won with only a modest gain in votes came partly as a result of passing the threshold of 4% of the votes required for a party to be allocated [[leveling seat]]s to bring their representation into proportion to the overall national vote (as opposed to direct regional mandates allocated on the basis of number of votes in the specific region). Venstre got six direct regional mandates and four allocated additional mandates.

===Losers===
*Non-socialist parties suffered a defeat well beyond its numbers, with almost half of its votes for the Progress party, which had been able to offer only external support to the Bondevik government; the other parties shunned any possible formal inclusion in the government coalition over differing views in several issues.
*The [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] obtained only a disappointing result, after polls that showed the party well beyond 15% at times during the electoral campaign.
*The [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]] lost a large share of votes and are no longer the largest non-Socialist party, surpassed by the Progress Party.
*The [[Christian Democratic Party of Norway|Christian Democratic Party]] almost halved its votes, and suffered one of the worst defeats ever.
*The [[Coastal Party]] lost its only representative in the parliament.
*The [[Red Electoral Alliance]] did not manage to obtain a seat in the parliament.
