It is mainly in the [[Himalayas]], but also includes parts of the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]. It is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|49th largest country]] by population and [[List of countries by area|93rd largest country]] by area. It is landlocked, and borders [[China]] in [[China–Nepal border|the north]] and [[India]] in [[India–Nepal border|the south]], east and west, while [[Bangladesh]] is located within only 27&nbsp;km (17&nbsp;mi) of its southeastern tip and [[Bhutan]] is separated from it by the Indian state of [[Sikkim]]. Nepal has a [[Geography of Nepal|diverse geography]], including [[Terai|fertile plains]], subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten [[List of highest mountains#List|tallest mountains]], including [[Mount Everest]], the highest point on Earth. [[Kathmandu]] is the capital and the largest city. Nepal is a multiethnic country, with [[Nepali language|Nepali]] as the official language.

The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the [[Vedic period]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]], the era in [[ancient India]] when [[Hinduism]] was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first millennium BCE, [[Gautama Buddha]], the founder of [[Buddhism]], was born in [[Lumbini]] in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of [[Tibet]]. The centrally located [[Kathmandu Valley]] is intertwined with the culture of [[Indo-Aryan people|Indo-Aryan]]s, and was the seat of the prosperous [[Newar people|Newar]] confederacy known as [[Nepal Mandala]]. The Himalayan branch of the ancient [[Silk Road]] was dominated by the [[Lhasa Newar|valley's traders]]. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional [[Newa art|art]] and [[Architecture of Nepal|architecture]]. 

By the 18th century, the [[Gorkha Kingdom]] achieved the [[unification of Nepal]]. The [[Shah dynasty]] established the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] and later formed an alliance with the [[British Empire]], under its [[Rana dynasty]] of [[Prime Minister of Nepal|premiers]]. The country was never colonized but served as a buffer state between [[Imperial China]] and [[British India]]. [[Parliamentary democracy]] was introduced in 1951, but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The [[Nepalese Civil War]] in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a [[secular]] [[republic]] in 2008, ending the world's last [[Hindu]] monarchy.

The [[Constitution of Nepal]], adopted in 2015, affirms Nepal as a [[Secular state|secular]] [[federal republic|federal]] [[parliamentary republic]] divided into [[Provinces of Nepal|seven provinces]]. It remains the only multi-party, fully democratic nation in the world ruled by a communist party. Nepal was admitted to the [[United Nations]] in 1955, and friendship treaties were signed with [[India]] in 1950 and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. Nepal is also a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[Bay of Bengal Initiative]]. The [[military of Nepal]] is the fifth largest in South Asia; it is notable for its [[Gurkha]] history, particularly during the [[world war]]s, and has been a significant contributor to [[United Nations peacekeeping]] operations.

== Etymology ==
Before the [[unification of Nepal]], the [[Kathmandu Valley|Kathmandu valley]] was known as ''Nepal''.{{efn|The entire territory controlled by the monarch seated in Kathmandu at any given time would also be referred to as ''Nepal''. Thus, at times, only the Kathmandu valley was considered ''Nepal'' while at other times, ''Nepal'' would encompass an area comparable to and largely overlapping with the modern state of Nepal<ref>{{Cite book |title=A history of ancient and early medieval India : from the Stone Age to the 12th century|last=Singh|first=Upinder|year=2008|location=New Delhi|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=9788131716779|page=477}}</ref>}} The precise origin of the term ''Nepāl'' is uncertain. ''Nepal'' appears in [[ancient Indian]] literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century BC. However, an absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the [[early modern period]]. Academic attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history, and insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages.<ref name=Malla>{{Cite web |title=Nepāla: Archaeology of the Word|last=Malla|first=Kamal P.|author-link=Kamal P.

According to [[Hindu mythology]], Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called ''Ne'', referred to variously as ''Ne Muni'' or ''Nemi''. According to ''Pashupati Purāna'', as a place protected by ''Ne'', the country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as ''Nepāl''.{{efn|The word ''pala'' in [[Pali]] language means ''to protect''. Consequently, ''Nepala'' translates to ''protected by Ne''.}} According to ''Nepāl Mahātmya'',{{efn|''Nepalamahatmya'', of 30 chapters about the Nepal ''Tirtha'' (pilgrimage) region, is a regional text that claims to be a part of the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', the largest ''[[Puranas#Mahapuranas|Mahāpurāṇa]]''.}} ''Nemi'' was charged with protection of the country by [[Pashupati]].<ref name=Prasad>{{Cite book |title=The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal|last=Prasad|first=Ishwari|year=1996|publisher=Ashish Publishing House|location=New Delhi|isbn=817024756X|via=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEvbH8Fv-boC}}</ref> According to [[Buddhist mythology]], [[Manjushri]] [[Bodhisattva]] drained a primordial lake of [[Nāga|serpents]] to create the Nepal valley and proclaimed that ''[[Adi-Buddha]]'' ''Ne'' would take care of the community that would settle it.

Norwegian [[Indology|indologist]] [[Christian Lassen]] had proposed that ''Nepāla'' was a compound of ''Nipa'' (foot of a mountain) and ''-ala'' (short suffix for ''alaya'' meaning abode), and so ''Nepāla'' meant "abode at the foot of the mountain".

Around 600 BCE, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal. From one of these, the [[Shakya]] polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life, founded [[Buddhism]], and came to be known as [[Gautama Buddha]] (traditionally dated 563–483 BCE).<ref name="Klostermaier">{{cite book |author=Klaus K.

=== Medieval Nepal ===
[[File:Sinja_Valley, Karnali.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sinja Valley]], thought to be the place of origin of the [[Khas]]as and the [[Nepali language]], was at the heart of the Khas Malla empire.|alt=A wooden bridge in Sinja Valley with wooden pillars on either side, their top sculpted to depict human figures standing on the platform.]]
In the 11th century, a [[Khasa Kingdom|powerful empire]] of [[Khas people]] emerged in western Nepal whose territory at its highest peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and [[Uttarakhand]] of India. By the 14th century, the empire had splintered into loosely associated ''[[Baise rajya]]s'', literally 22 states as they were counted. The rich culture and language of the Khas people spread throughout Nepal and as far as Indo-China in the intervening centuries; [[Khas language|their language]], later renamed Nepali language, became the lingua franca of Nepal as well as much of North-east India.<ref name=leo/>

In south-eastern Nepal, Simraungarh annexed [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] around 1100 CE, and the unified Tirhut stood as a powerful kingdom for more than 200 years,<ref name=Darnal/> even ruling over Kathmandu for a time.{{sfn|Landon|1928|pp=32-33}} After another 300 years of Muslim rule, Tirhut came under the control of the Sens of [[Makwanpur District|Makawanpur]].<ref name=Darnal>{{cite journal |last=Darnal|first=Prakash|date=31 December 2018|title=A Review of Simarongarh's History on Its Nexus Areas with References of Archaeological Evidences|journal=Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology|language=en|volume=12|pages=18–26|doi=10.3126/dsaj.v12i0.22176|issn=1994-2672|doi-access=free}}</ref> In the eastern hills, a confederation of Kirat principalities ruled the area between Kathmandu and Bengal.

[[File:Patan Durbar Square Lalitpur.jpg|thumb|right|[[Patan Durbar Square]], one of the three palace squares in the Kathmandu Valley, was built by the Mallas in the 17th century. The Durbar Squares are a culmination of over a millennium of development in Nepali art and architecture.|alt=Patan Durbar Square has many buildings, mostly temples, built in the Pagoda style, and a couple of temples of [[Shikhara]] architecture showcasing the pinnacle of Nepali wood-, stone- and metal-craft.]]
In the Kathmandu valley, the [[Malla (Nepal)|Mallas]], who make several appearances in Nepalese history since ancient times, had established themselves in Kathmandu and Patan by middle of the 14th century. The Mallas ruled the valley first under the suzerainty of Tirhut, but established independent reign by late 14th century as Tirhut went into decline. In the late 14th century, [[Jayasthiti Malla]] introduced widespread socio-economic reforms, principal of which was the caste system. By dividing the indigenous non-Aryan Buddhist population into castes modelled after the four [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna system]] of Hinduism, he provided an influential model for the Sanskritization and Hinduization of the indigenous non-Hindu tribal populations in all principalities throughout Nepal. By the middle of the 15th century, Kathmandu had become a powerful empire which, according to [[William James Kirkpatrick|Kirkpatrick]], extended from Digarchi or Sigatse in Tibet to Tirhut and Gaya in India.{{sfn|Landon|1928|p=39}} In the late 15th century, Malla princes divided their kingdom in four — Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur in the valley and Banepa to the east. The competition for prestige among these brotherly kingdoms saw the flourishing of art and architecture in central Nepal, and the building of famous [[Kathmandu Durbar Square|Kathmandu]], [[Patan Durbar Square|Patan]] and [[Bhaktapur Durbar Square]]s; their division and mistrust led to their fall in the late 18th century, and ultimately, unification of Nepal into a modern state.<ref name=leo/>{{sfn|Landon|1928|pp=52-61}}

Apart from one destructive sacking of Kathmandu in the early 13th century, Nepal remain largely untouched by the [[Muslim invasion of India]] that began in the 11th century. However, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal period]] saw an influx of high-caste Hindus from India into Nepal. They soon intermingled with the Khas people and by the 16th century, there were about 50 Rajput-ruled principalities in Nepal, including the 22 baisi states and, to their east in west-central Nepal, 24 [[Chaubisi rajya|''Chaubisi'' states]]. There emerged a view that Nepal remained the true bastion of unadulterated Hinduism at a time when Indian culture had been influenced by centuries of Mughal, followed by [[British Raj|British rule]]. [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]], one of the Baisi states, emerged as an influential and ambitious kingdom with a reputation for justice, after it codified the first Hinduism-based laws in the Nepalese hills.<ref name=leo/>

In the mid-18th century, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], a [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] king, set out to put together what would become present-day Nepal. He embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms. After several bloody battles and sieges, notably the [[Battle of Kirtipur]], he managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in 1769.<ref>{{cite book |last=Giuseppe |first=Father |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSsoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA307 |title=Account of the Kingdom of Nepal |work=Asiatick Researches |publisher=London: Vernor and Hood |year=1799 |page=308 |access-date=2 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016233414/https://books.google.com/books?id=vSsoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA307 |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Gorkha control reached its height when the North Indian territories of the [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom]]s in the west to [[Sikkim]] in the east came under Nepalese control. A dispute with [[Tibet]] over the control of mountain passes and inner Tingri valleys of Tibet forced the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Emperor]] of China to start the [[Sino-Nepalese War|Sino-Nepali War]] compelling the Nepali to retreat to their own borders in the north.{{sfn|Landon|1928|pp=68-69}}
Rivalry between the Kingdom of Nepal and the [[East India Company]] over the control of states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War|Anglo-Nepali War]] (1815–16). At first, the British underestimated the Nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing. Thus began the reputation of [[Gurkha]]s as fierce and ruthless soldiers. The war ended in the [[Sugauli Treaty]], under which Nepal ceded recently captured lands.{{sfn|Landon|1928|pp=75-80}}<ref name=leo/>

Factionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability. In 1846, a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow Jung Bahadur Kunwar, a fast-rising military leader. This led to the [[Kot massacre]]; armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country. Bir Narsingh Kunwar emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana dynasty]], and came to be known as [[Jung Bahadur Rana]]. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Ranas were staunchly pro-British and assisted them during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] (and later in both World Wars). In 1860 some parts of the western Terai region were gifted to Nepal by the British as a friendly gesture because of her military help to sustain British control in India during the rebellion (known as ''[[Naya Muluk]]'', new country). In 1923, the [[United Kingdom]] and Nepal formally signed [[Nepal–Britain Treaty of 1923|an agreement of friendship]] that superseded the Sugauli Treaty of 1816.<ref name="auto">{{cite book |first1=andrea matles |last1=savada |first2=george lawrence |last2=harris |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/93012226/ |title=Nepal and Bhutan : country studies |access-date=26 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630034937/https://www.loc.gov/item/93012226/ |archive-date=30 June 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy. Following the success of Indian Independence Movement which Nepalese activists had taken part in, with India's support and cooperation of King Tribhuvan, [[Nepali Congress]] was successful in toppling the Rana regime, establishing a parliamentary democracy. After a decade of power wrangling between the king and the government, [[Mahendra of Nepal|King Mahendra]] (ruled 1955–1972) scrapped the democratic experiment in 1960, and a "partyless" [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system was created to govern Nepal.

Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about {{convert|800|km|mi|-1}} long and {{convert|200|km|mi|-1}} wide, with an area of {{convert|147516|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. It lies between latitudes [[26th parallel north|26°]] and [[31st parallel north|31°N]], and longitudes [[80th meridian east|80°]] and [[89th meridian east|89°E]]. Nepal's defining geological processes began 75&nbsp;million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]], began a north-eastward [[Plate tectonics|drift]] caused by [[seafloor spreading]] to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.<ref name=ali>{{cite journal |last1=Ali|first1=J.

[[File:Everest kalapatthar crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Everest]], the highest peak on earth, lies on the Nepal-China border.]]
Nepal is divided into three principal physiographic belts known as ''[[himalayas|Himal]]''-''[[Lower Himalayan Range|Pahad]]''-''[[Terai]]''.{{efn|This trichotomy is a prominent feature of Nepali discourse and is represented in the [[Emblem of Nepal]], with blue and white peaks signifying ''Himal'', green hills below them signifying ''Pahad'' and the yellow strip at the bottom signifying the ''Terai'' belt.}} Himal is the mountain region containing snow and situated in the Great Himalayan Range; it makes up the northern part of Nepal. It contains the highest elevations in the world including {{convert|8848|m|ft|0}} height [[Mount Everest]] (''Sagarmāthā'' in Nepali) on the border with China. Seven other of the world's "[[eight-thousander]]s" are in Nepal or on its border with China: [[Lhotse]], [[Makalu]], [[Cho Oyu]], [[Kangchenjunga]], [[Dhaulagiri]], [[Annapurna]] and [[Manaslu]]. Pahad is the mountain region that does not generally contain snow. The mountains vary from {{convert|800|to|4000|m|ft|-2}} in altitude, with progression from subtropical climates below {{convert|1200|m|ft|-2}} to alpine climates above {{convert|3600|m|ft|-2}}. The [[Lower Himalayan Range]], reaching {{convert|1500|to|3000|m|ft|-2}}, is the southern limit of this region, with subtropical river valleys and "hills" alternating to the north of this range. Population density is high in valleys but notably less above {{convert|2000|m|ft|-2}} and very low above {{convert|2500|m|ft|-2}}, where snow occasionally falls in winter. The southern lowland plains or ''Terai'' bordering India are part of the northern rim of the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]. Terai is the lowland region containing some hill ranges. The plains were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan rivers: the [[Koshi River|Koshi]], the [[Gandaki River|Narayani]], and the [[Ghaghara|Karnali]] as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline. This region has subtropical to tropical climate. The outermost range of the foothills called [[Sivalik Hills]] or Churia Range, cresting at {{convert|700|to|1000|m|ft|-1}}, marks the limits of the Gangetic Plain; however broad, low valleys called [[Inner Terai Valleys of Nepal|Inner Terai Valleys]] ({{Lang|ne|Bhitri Tarai Upatyaka}}) lie north of these foothills in several places.

The Indian plate continues to move north relative to Asia at about {{Convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} per year.<ref>Bilham ''et al.'', 1998;{{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2020}} Pandey ''et al.'', 1995.{{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2020}}</ref> This makes Nepal an earthquake prone zone, and periodic earthquakes that have devastating consequences present a significant hurdle to development. Erosion of the Himalayas is a very important source of sediment, which flows to the Indian Ocean.<ref>Summerfield & Hulton, 1994;{{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2020}} Hay, 1998.{{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2020}}</ref> Saptakoshi, in particular, carries huge amount of silt out of Nepal but sees extreme drop in Gradient in [[Bihar]], causing severe floods and course changes, and is therefore, known as the sorrow of Bihar. Severe flooding and landslides cause deaths and disease, destroy farmlands and cripple the transport infrastructure of the country, during the monsoon season each year.

Nepal has five climatic zones, broadly corresponding to the altitudes. The tropical and subtropical zones lie below {{convert|1200|m|ft|-2}}, the [[temperate]] zone {{convert|1200|to|2400|m|ft|-2}}, the cold zone {{convert|2400|to|3600|m|ft|-2}}, the subarctic zone {{convert|3600|to|4400|m|ft|-2}}, and the Arctic zone above {{convert|4400|m|ft|-2}}. Nepal experiences five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]], autumn, winter and spring. The Himalayas block cold winds from Central Asia in the winter and form the northern limits of the monsoon wind patterns.

Nepal, officially opened to westerners in 1951, became a popular destination at the end of the [[hippie trail]], during the 1960s and 1970s. The industry, disrupted by the civil war in the 1990s, has since recovered but faces challenges to growth, owing to a lack of proper facilities for high-end tourism termed the "infrastructure bottleneck", the flag carrier in shambles, and a handful of destinations properly developed and marketed. The home-stay tourism, in which cultural and eco-tourists stay as paying guests in the homes of indigenous people, has seen some success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/68553/|title=Homestay registration on the rise|last=Sunuwar|first=Muna|website=My Republica|language=en|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref>

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Nepal}}
The citizens of Nepal are known as [[Nepali people|Nepali]] or Nepalese. The Nepali are descendants of three major migrations from India, [[Tibet]] and North Burma, and the Chinese province of [[Yunnan]] via [[Assam]]. Among the earliest inhabitants were the [[Kirat]] of the eastern region, [[Newar]]s of the [[Kathmandu Valley]], aboriginal [[Tharu people|Tharus]] of the Terai plains and the Khas Pahari people of the far-western hills. Despite the migration of a significant section of the population to the Terai in recent years, the majority of Nepalese still live in the central highlands, and the northern mountains are sparsely populated.

Nepal is a multicultural and multiethnic country, home to 125 distinct ethnic groups, speaking 123 different mother tongues and following a number of indigenous and folk religions in addition to Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity.{{sfn|2011 National Census|p=4}} According to the 2011 census, Nepal's population was 26.5&nbsp;million, almost a threefold increase from nine million in 1950. From 2001 to 2011, the average family size declined from 5.44 to 4.9. The census also noted some 1.9&nbsp;million absentee people, over a million more than in 2001; most are male labourers employed overseas. This correlated with the drop in sex ratio to 94.2 from 99.8 for 2001.{{sfn|2011 National Census|p=3}} The annual population growth rate was 1.35% between 2001 and 2011, compared to an average of 2.25% between 1961 and 2001; also attributed to the absentee population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nepal.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Nepal%20Population%20Situation%20Analysis.pdf|title=Population situation analysis of Nepal|publisher=[[UNFPA]]|year=2017|access-date=4 December 2019}}</ref>

Nepal is one of the ten least urbanized, and the ten fastest urbanizing countries in the world. {{As of| 2014}}, an estimated 18.3% of the population lived in urban areas. Urbanization rate is high in the Terai, doon valleys of the inner Terai and valleys of the middle hills, but low in the high Himalayas. Similarly, the rate is higher in central and eastern Nepal compared to further west.<ref>{{cite report|title=Urbanisation and urban growth in Nepal (GSDRC Helpdesk Research Report 1294)|year=2015|publisher=UK:GSDRC|location=University of Birmingham, Birmingham|last=Bakrania|first=S.}}</ref> The capital, [[Kathmandu]], nicknamed the "City of temples", is the largest city in the country and the cultural and economic heart. Other large cities in Nepal include [[Pokhara]], [[Biratnagar]], [[Lalitpur, Nepal|Lalitpur]], [[Bharatpur, Nepal|Bharatpur]], [[Birgunj]], [[Dharan, Nepal|Dharan]], [[Hetauda]] and [[Nepalgunj]]. Congestion, pollution and drinking water shortage are some of the major problems facing the rapidly growing cities, most prominently the Kathmandu Valley.

=== Language ===
{{Main|Languages of Nepal}}
Nepal's diverse linguistic heritage stems from three major language groups: [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tibeto-Burman]], and various [[indigenous language]] isolates. The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as native language) according to the 2011 census are [[Nepali language|Nepali]] (44.6%), [[Maithili language|Maithili]] (11.7%), [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] (6.0%), [[Tharu language|Tharu]] (5.8%), [[Tamang language|Tamang]] (5.1%), [[Nepal Bhasa]] (3.2%), [[Bajjika dialect|Bajjika]] (3%) and [[Magar language|Magar]] (3.0%), [[Doteli language|Doteli]] (3.0%), [[Urdu]] (2.6%), [[Awadhi]] (1.89%), and [[Sunwar language|Sunwar]]. Nepal is home to at least four indigenous [[Nepali Sign Language|sign languages]].

Descendent of [[Sanskrit]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] is written in [[Devanagari]] script. It is the official language and serves as ''lingua franca'' among Nepali of different ethnolinguistic groups. The regional languages [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]] and Bhojpuri are spoken in the southern Terai region; [[Urdu]] is common among [[Nepali Muslims]]. [[Tibetic languages|Varieties of Tibetan]] are spoken in and north of the higher Himalaya where standard literary Tibetan is widely understood by those with religious education. Local dialects in the Terai and hills are mostly unwritten with efforts underway to develop systems for writing many in Devanagari or the Roman alphabet.

===Society===
Traditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The [[Caste system in Nepal|Nepali caste system]] embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in South Asia. Social classes are defined by more than a hundred [[endogamous]] hereditary groups, often termed as ''[[jāti]]s'', or "castes". Nepal declared [[untouchability]] to be illegal in 1963<ref>{{cite book |last=Bista|first=Dor Bahadur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzFROpFVYRAC|title=Fatalism and Development: Nepal's Struggle for Modernization|date=1991|publisher=[[Orient Blackswan]]|isbn=978-81-250-0188-1|language=en|page=44}}</ref> and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. At the workplace and educational institutions in urban Nepal, caste-related identification has pretty much lost its importance.

Family values are important in the Nepali tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in Nepal, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority of Nepalis, with or without their consent, have [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|their marriages arranged]] by their parents or other family elders. Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low, with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.<ref>{{cite journal |first= Bala Ram|last=Acharya|date=2005|title=Sociological Analysis of Divorce: A Case Study from Pokhara, Nepal|url=https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/DSAJ/article/view/284|journal=[[Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology]]|language=en|volume=1|pages=129–145|doi=10.3126/dsaj.v1i0.284|issn=1994-2672|doi-access=free}}</ref> [[Child marriage]]s are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nepal.unfpa.org/en/node/15217|title=Child Marriage|date=30 December 2015|website=[[UNFPA]] Nepal|language=en|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>

Many [[Public holidays in Nepal|Nepali festivals]] are religious in origin. The best known include: [[Dashain]], [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]], [[Teej]], [[Chhath]], [[Maghi]], [[Sakela]], [[Holi]], [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Christmas]], and the [[Vaisakhi|Nepali new year]].

The emblem of Nepal depicts the snowy Himalayas, the forested hills, and the fertile Terai, supported by a wreath of rhododendrons, with the national flag at the crest and in the foreground, a plain white map of Nepal below it, and a man's and woman's right hands joined to signify gender equality.

The president is the symbol of national unity. The [[Martyrs of Nepal|martyrs]] are the symbols of patriotism. Commanders of the Anglo-Nepalese war, Amar Singh Thapa, Bhakti Thapa, and Balbhadra Kunwar are considered war heroes.

Prithvi Narayan Shah, the founder of modern Nepal, is held in high regard and considered "Father of the Nation" by many.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/nepali/news-42652772|title=११ वर्षपछि राष्ट्रिय एकता दिवस|date=11 January 2018 |language=en-GB |access-date=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hutt1991/>

The oldest known examples of architecture in Nepal are [[stupa]]s of early Buddhist constructions in and around [[Kapilvastu District|Kapilvastu]] in south-western Nepal, and those constructed by [[Ashoka]] in the [[Kathmandu Valley]] {{circa}} 250 BCE. The characteristic architecture associated exclusively with Nepal was developed and refined by Newa artisans of the Kathmandu Valley starting no later than the Lichchhavi period. A [[Tang dynasty]] Chinese travel book, probably based on records from {{circa}} 650 CE, describes contemporary Nepali architecture, predominantly built with wood, as rich in artistry, as well as wood and metal sculpture. It describes a magnificent seven-storied pagoda in the middle of a palace, with copper-tiled roofs, its balustrade, grills, columns and beams set about with fine and precious stones, and four golden sculptures of [[Makara]]s in the four corners of the base spouting water from their mouths like a fountain, supplied by copper pipes connected to the runnels at the top of the tower. Later Chinese chronicles describe Nepal's king's palace as an immense structure with many roofs, suggesting that Chinese were not yet familiar with the pagoda architecture, which has now become one of the chief characteristic of Chinese architecture. A typical pagoda temple is built with wood, every piece of it finely carved with geometrical patterns or images of gods, goddesses, mythical beings and beasts. The roofs usually tiled with clay, and sometimes gold plated, diminish in proportion successively until the topmost roof is reached which is itself ensigned by a golden finial. The base is usually composed of rectangular terraces of finely carved stone; the entrance is usually guarded by stone sculptures of conventional figures. Bronze and copper craftsmanship observable in the sculpture of deities and beasts, decorations of doors and windows and the finials of buildings, as well as items of every day use is found to be of equal splendour. The most well-developed of Nepali painting traditions is the [[thanka]] or [[paubha]] painting tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], practised in Nepal by the Buddhist monks and Newar artisans. [[Changu Narayan Temple]], built {{circa}} 4th century CE has probably the finest of Nepali woodcraft; the Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares are the culmination of Nepali art and architecture, showcasing Nepali wood, metal and stone craftsmanship refined over two millennia.<ref name=landon2>{{Cite book|last=Landon Perceval|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.81837|title=Nepal Vol II|date=1928}}</ref>

The [[Newar window|"ankhijhyal" window]], that allow a one-way view of the outside world, is an example of unique Nepali woodcraft, found in building structures, domestic and public alike, ancient and modern. Many cultures paint the walls of their homes with regular patterns, figures of gods and beasts and religious symbols; others paint their walls plain, often with clay or [[chernozem]] contrasted with yellow soil or limestone. The roofs of religious as well as domestic structures project considerably, presumably to provide protection from the sun and the rain. The timber of domestic structures are finely carved as with their religious counterparts.<ref name=landon2/>

===Literature and the performing arts===
{{main|Nepalese literature|Music of Nepal|Cinema of Nepal}}
Nepal's literature was closely intertwined with that of the rest of South Asia until its unification into a modern kingdom. Literary works, which were written in Sanskrit by Brahmin priests educated and sometimes also based in Varanasi, included religious texts and other fantasies involving kings, gods and demons.<ref name=bba/> The oldest extant Nepali language text is dated to the 13th century but except for the epigraphic material, Nepali language literature older than the 17th century haven't been found. However, Newar literature dates back almost 500 years.<ref name=Hutt1991/> The modern history of Nepali literature begins with Bhanubhakta Acharya (1814-1868), who for the first time composed major and influential works in Nepali, the language accessible to the masses, most prominently, the [[Bhanubhakta Ramayana]], a translation of the ancient Hindu epic.<ref name=bba>{{Cite journal|last=Maitra|first=Kiran Shankar|date=1982|title=The First Poet of Nepali Literature|journal=Indian Literature|volume=25|issue=5|pages=63–71|issn=0019-5804|jstor=23331113}}</ref> By the end of the nineteenth century, [[Motiram Bhatta]] had published print editions of the works of Acharya, and through his efforts, single-handedly popularised and propelled Nepali language literature into modernity.<ref name=Hutt1991/> By the mid-twentieth century, Nepali literature was no longer limited to the Hindu literary traditions.

Newar literature also emerged as a premier literary tradition. After the advent of democracy in 1951, Nepali literature flourished. Literary works in many other languages began to be produced.

===Clothing===
[[File:Bhoto jatra.jpg|thumb|right|A Nepali man in Daura-Suruwal, coat and Dhaka topi, displays the bhoto during the [[Bhoto Jatra]] festival.]]
The most widely worn traditional dress in Nepal, for both women and men, from ancient times until the advent of modern times, was draped.<ref name="Tarlo1996-26">{{cite book |last=Tarlo|first=Emma|title=Clothing Matters: Dress and Identity in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ByoTXhXCuyAC&pg=PA26|year=1996|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago and London|isbn=978-0-226-78976-7|page=26}}</ref> For women, it eventually took the form of a [[sari]], a single long piece of cloth, famously six yards long, and of width spanning the lower body.<ref name="Tarlo1996-26"/> The sari is tied around the waist and knotted at one end, wrapped around the lower body, and then over the shoulder.<ref name="Tarlo1996-26"/> In its more modern form, it has been used to cover the head, and sometimes the face, as a veil,<ref name="Tarlo1996-26"/> particularly in the Terai. It has been combined with an underskirt, or the [[Petticoat#Asian petticoats|petticoat]], and tucked in the waistband for more secure fastening. It is worn with a [[blouse]], or [[choli|cholo]], which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end, passing over the shoulder, now serving to obscure the upper body's contours, and to cover the midriff.<ref name="Tarlo1996-26"/> Cholo-sari has become the attire of choice for formal occasions, official environs and festive gatherings. In its more traditional form, as part of traditional dresses and as worn in daily life while performing household chores or labour, it takes the form of a ''fariya'' or ''gunyu'', usually shorter than a sari in length as well as breadth, and all of it wrapped around the lower body.

For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the [[dhoti]], has served as a lower-body garment.<ref name="Tarlo1996-26-28">{{cite book |last=Tarlo|first=Emma|title=Clothing Matters: Dress and Identity in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ByoTXhXCuyAC&pg=PA26|year=1996|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago and London|isbn=978-0-226-78976-7|pages=26–28}}</ref> It too is tied around the waist and wrapped.<ref name="Tarlo1996-26-28"/> Among the Aryans, it is also wrapped once around each leg before being brought up through the legs to be tucked in at the back. Dhoti or its variants, usually worn over a [[kaupinam|langauti]], constitute the lower-body garment in the traditional clothing of Tharus, Gurungs and Magars as well as the Madhesi people, among others. Other forms of traditional apparel that involve no stitching or tailoring are the [[Patuka]]s (a length of cloth wrapped tightly over the waist by both sexes as a waistband, a part of most traditional Nepali costumes, usually with a Khukuri tucked into it when worn by men), scarves like Pachhyauras and majetros and shawls like the Newar ''Ga'' and Tibetan [[khata]], Ghumtos (the wedding veils) and various kinds of [[turban]]s (scarves worn around the head as a part of a tradition, or to keep off the sun or the cold,<ref name="Tarlo1996-26-28"/> called a [[Pheta]], Pagri or Sirpau).

Until the beginning of the first millennium CE, the ordinary dress of people in South Asia was entirely unstitched.<ref name="Rahman-Alkazi2002">{{cite book |last=Alkazi |first=Roshen |editor=Rahman, Abdur |title=India's Interaction with China, Central and West Asia |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZvpAAAAMAAJ |year=2002 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-565789-0 |pages=464–484 |chapter=Evolution of Indian Costume as a result of the links between Central Asia and India in ancient and medieval times}}</ref> The arrival of the Kushans from [[Central Asia]], [[circa]] 48 CE, popularised cut and sewn garments in the style of Central Asia.<ref name="Rahman-Alkazi2002"/> The simplest form of sewn clothing, Bhoto (a rudimentary vest), is a universal unisex clothing for children, and traditionally the only clothing children wear until they come of age and are given adult garb, sometimes in a ceremonial rite of passage, such as the gunyu-choli ceremony for Hindu girls. Men continue to wear bhoto through adulthood. Upper body garment for men is usually a vest such as the bhoto, or a shirt similar to the [[Kurta]], such as Daura, a closed-necked double-breasted long shirt with five pleats and eight strings that serve to tie it around the body. Suruwal, simply translated as a pair of trousers, is an alternative to and, more recently, replacement for dhoti, kachhad (Magars) or Lungi (Tharus); it is traditionally much wider above the knees but tapers below, to fit tightly at the ankles, and is tied to the waist with a drawstring. Modern cholos worn with sarees are usually half-sleeved and single-breasted, and do not cover the midriff. The traditional one called the chaubandi cholo, like the daura, is full-sleeved, double-breasted with pleats and strings, and extends down to the patuka, covering the midriff.

Daura-Suruwal and Gunyu-Cholo were the national dresses for men and women respectively until 2011 when they were removed to eliminate favouritism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://narimag.com.np/news/2019-05-21/20190521125417.html |script-title=ne:गुन्यू–चोलो तथा फरिया जोगाउने अभियान|website=narimag.com.np|language=Nepali|access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref> Traditional dresses of many pahari ethnic groups are Daura-Suruwal or similar, with patuka, a dhaka topi and a coat for men, and Gunyu-cholo or similar, with patuka and sometimes a scarf for women. For many other groups, men's traditional dresses consist of a shirt or a vest, paired with a dhoti, kachhad or lungi. In the high himalayas, the traditional dresses are largely influenced by Tibetan culture. Sherpa women wear the [[chuba]] with the [[pangi (apron)|pangi]] apron, while Sherpa men wear shirts with stiff high collar and long sleeves called tetung under the chuba. Tibetan Xamo Gyaise hats of the Sherpas, [[dhaka topi]] of pahari men and tamang round caps are among the more distinctive headwears.

Married Hindu women wear tika, sindur, pote and red bangles. Jewellery of gold and silver, and sometimes precious stones, are common. Gold jewellery includes Mangalsutras and tilaharis worn with the pote by the Hindus, Samyafung (a huge gold flower worn on the head) and Nessey (huge flattened gold earrings) worn by the Limbus, and Sirphuli, Sirbandhi and Chandra worn by the Magars. Tharu women can wear as much as six kilograms of silver in jewellery, which includes Mangiya worn on the head, tikuli the forehead, and kanseri and tikahamala around the neck.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/last-of-tharu-jewellry/|title=Last of Tharu jewellry?|date=11 August 2006|website=The Himalayan Times|language=en-US|access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref>

In the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in Nepal. Increasingly, in urban settings, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, transformed instead into one for formal occasions. The traditional kurta suruwal is rarely worn by younger women, who increasingly favour jeans. The dhoti has largely been reduced to the [[liturgical]] [[vestment]] of shamans and Hindu priests.

The foundation of a typical Nepali meal is a cereal cooked in plain fashion, and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.<ref name="Davidson2014-p409">{{cite book |last=Davidson|first=Alan|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RL6LAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA409|year=2014|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-967733-7|page=409}}</ref> The latter includes [[lentil]]s, [[pulses]] and vegetables spiced commonly with [[ginger root|ginger]] and [[garlic]], but also more discerningly with a combination of spices that may include [[coriander]], [[cumin]], [[turmeric]], [[cinnamon]], [[cardamon]], [[jimbu]] and others as informed by culinary conventions.<ref name="Davidson2014-p409"/> In an actual meal, this mental representation takes the form of a platter, or [[thali]], with a central place for the cooked cereal, peripheral ones, often in small bowls, for the flavourful accompaniments, and the simultaneous, rather than piecemeal, ingestion of the two in each act of eating, whether by actual mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or in the folding of one—such as bread—around the other, such as cooked vegetables.<ref name="Davidson2014-p409"/> ''Dal-bhat'', centred around steamed rice is the most common example.<ref name=cnnfood/> as well as dairy and sometimes meat, is the most common and prominent example. The unleavened flat bread made from wheat flour called [[chapati]] occasionally replaces the steamed rice, particularly in the Terai, while Dhindo, prepared by boiling corn, millet or buckwheat flour in water, continuously stirring and adding flour until thick, almost solid consistency is reached, is the main substitute in the hills and mountains. Tsampa, flour made from roasted barley or naked barley, is the main staple in the high himalayas. Throughout Nepal, fermented, then sun-dried, leafy greens called ''Gundruk'', are both a delicacy and a vital substitute for fresh vegetables in the winter.<ref name=pathak/>
