[[File:Personal flag of Queen Elizabeth II.svg|thumb|120px|Many of the flags Queen Elizabeth II utilizes in the countries of which she is as head of state feature the device found in her personal flag, which is somewhat different from her [[royal cypher]].]]

[[Queen Elizabeth II]] has and has had a variety of flags to represent her personally and as head of state of 16 independent nations around the world. They are usually used on any building, ship, car, or aircraft where she is present.

These [[heraldic flag]]s are usually a nation's coat of arms in [[Banner of arms|banner form]].

==Princess Elizabeth and Duchess of Edinburgh==
Princess Elizabeth's personal standard prior to her accession as queen was her coat of arms in banner form. This consisted of four quarters consisting of three lions passant for [[England]], a lion rampant for [[Scotland]], and a Gaelic harp for [[Ireland]]. To differentiate the arms of Princess Elizabeth from that of the King it was [[Difference (heraldry)|differenced]] with a white [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose and the first and third a cross of St George.

Upon the death of her father, Princess Elizabeth became Queen Elizabeth II and therefore adopted the Royal Standard. This flag is used to represent the Queen not only in the United Kingdom but also overseas when she makes state visits. It is the royal arms in banner form undifferentiated.

| quote = Queen Elizabeth II has adopted a personal flag in addition to the Royal Standard. [...] The flag was designed in the College of Arms under the personal direction of the Garter King of Arms, Sir George Bellow. It consists of the letter 'E' ensigned with the royal crown, the whole within a chaplet of roses, all in gold on a blue field.

The crown is a symbol of the Queen's rank and dignity, whilst the roses symbolise the 53 countries of the Commonwealth. (The "crowned 'E'" emblem also appears in the Queen's personal flags for [[Queen's Personal Australian Flag|Australia]], [[Queen's Personal Barbadian Flag|Barbados]], [[Queen's Personal Jamaican Flag|Jamaica]], [[Royal standards of Canada|Canada]], and [[Queen's Personal Flag for New Zealand|New Zealand]].)

The flag was created at the Queen's request in December 1960 to symbolise her as an individual, not associated with her role as sovereign of any particular [[Commonwealth realm]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Over time, the flag started to be used in place of the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|British royal standard]] when the Queen visits Commonwealth countries where she is not head of state and for Commonwealth occasions in the United Kingdom; it came to symbolise the Queen as [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. Eventually, the practice evolved wherein the flag is raised at [[Marlborough House]] (the headquarters of the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]]) in London when the Queen visits, rather than the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom.<ref>

==Commonwealth realms==
Since the 1960s, flags have been introduced to represent the Queen in various [[Commonwealth realms]]. These flags have followed the same basic pattern: the nation's coat of arms in banner form with the device found on her personal flag. These flags are only used by the Queen when she is in their respective countries. The Queen's representatives in these nations have their own flags to represent them.
