It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[art rock]], [[disco]], and particularly the "[[Krautrock]]" of bands like [[Kraftwerk]]. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the [[post-punk]] era as part of the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement of the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.

Electronic musical synthesizers that could be used practically in a recording studio became available in the mid-1960s, while the mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art musicians. After the breakthrough of [[Gary Numan]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s. In Japan, [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] introduced the [[TR-808]] rhythm machine to popular music, and the band would be a major influence on early British synth-pop acts. The development of inexpensive [[polyphonic]] synthesizers, the definition of [[MIDI]] and the use of [[Dance music|dance]] beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the [[New Romantic]] movement, together with the rise of [[MTV]], led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts in the US during the [[Second British Invasion]].

"Synth-pop" is sometimes used interchangeably with "[[electropop]]",<ref name="electrosynth"/> but "electropop" may also denote a variant of synth-pop that places more emphasis on a harder, more electronic sound.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=107}} In the mid to late 1980s, duos such as [[Erasure]] and [[Pet Shop Boys]] adopted a style that was highly successful on the US dance charts, but by the end of the decade, the 'new wave' synth-pop of bands such as [[A-ha]] and [[Alphaville (band)|Alphaville]] was giving way to [[house music]] and [[techno]]. Interest in new wave synth-pop began to revive in the [[indietronica]] and [[electroclash]] movements in the late 1990s, and in the 2000s synth-pop enjoyed a widespread revival and commercial success.

The genre has received criticism for alleged lack of emotion and musicianship; prominent artists have spoken out against detractors who believed that synthesizers themselves composed and played the songs. Synth-pop music has established a place for the synthesizer as a major element of [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]], directly influencing subsequent genres (including [[house music]] and [[Detroit techno]]) and has indirectly influenced many other genres, as well as individual recordings.

==Characteristics==

Synth-pop was defined by its primary use of synthesizers, [[drum machine]]s and [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], sometimes using them to replace all other instruments. Borthwick and Moy have described the genre as diverse but "...characterised by a broad set of values that eschewed rock playing styles, rhythms and structures", which were replaced by "synthetic textures" and "robotic rigidity", often defined by the limitations of the new technology,<ref name=Borthwick&Moy2004pp121-3/> including [[Monophonic (synthesizers)|monophonic]] synthesizers (only able to play one note at a time).<ref>Barry R. Parker, ''Good Vibrations: the Physics of Music'' (Boston MD: JHU Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-8018-9264-3}}, p. 213.</ref>

Many synth-pop musicians had limited musical skills, relying on the technology to produce or reproduce the music. The result was often minimalist, with grooves that were "typically woven together from simple repeated riffs often with no harmonic 'progression' to speak of".<ref>{{Citation |author=M.

In its second phase in the 1980s,<ref name=Reynolds2009/> the introduction of dance beats and more conventional rock instrumentation made the music warmer and catchier and contained within the conventions of three-minute pop.<ref name=AMsynthpop>{{citation|title=Synth pop |publisher=AllMusic |url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d18|pure_url=yes}} |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5x6RaN2Dj?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/synth-pop-d18 |archive-date=11 March 2011 |url-status=dead }}.</ref><ref name="Reynolds2010"/> Synthesizers were increasingly used to imitate the conventional and clichéd sound of orchestras and horns. Thin, treble-dominant, synthesized melodies and simple drum programmes gave way to thick, and compressed production, and a more conventional drum sound.<ref name=Cateforis2009/> Lyrics were generally more optimistic, dealing with more traditional subject matter for pop music such as romance, escapism and aspiration.<ref name=Reynolds2009/> According to music writer [[Simon Reynolds]], the hallmark of 1980s synth-pop was its "emotional, at times operatic singers" such as [[Marc Almond]], [[Alison Moyet]] and [[Annie Lennox]].<ref name="Reynolds2010">{{citation|title=The 1980s revival that lasted an entire decade |author=S.

Although synth-pop in part arose from [[punk rock]], it abandoned punk's emphasis on ''authenticity'' and often pursued a deliberate ''artificiality'', drawing on the critically derided forms such as disco and [[glam rock]].<ref name=Borthwick&Moy2004pp121-3>{{citation|title=Popular Music Genres: an Introduction|author1=S.

In the new millennium, renewed interest in electronic music and nostalgia for the 1980s led to the beginnings of a synth-pop revival, with acts including [[Adult (band)|Adult]] and [[Fischerspooner]]. Between 2003 and 2004, it began to move into the mainstream with [[Ladytron]], the [[Postal Service (band)|Postal Service]], [[Cut Copy]], [[The Bravery]] and [[The Killers]] all producing records that incorporated vintage synthesizer sounds and styles that contrasted with the dominant genres of [[post-grunge]] and [[nu metal]]. In particular, The Killers enjoyed considerable airplay and exposure and their debut album ''[[Hot Fuss]]'' (2004) reached the top ten of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=Cateforis2011pp218-9>{{citation|title=Are We Not New Wave?: Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s|author=T.

[[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] frontman [[Andy McCluskey]] recalled a great many people "who thought that the equipment wrote the song for you", and asserted: "Believe me, if there was a button on a synth or a drum machine that said 'hit single', I would have pressed it as often as anybody else would have – ''but there isn't''.

According to Simon Reynolds, in some quarters synthesizers were seen as instruments for "effete poseurs", in contrast to the phallic guitar.<ref name="Reynolds2005p337"/> The association of synth-pop with an alternative sexuality was reinforced by the images projected by synth-pop stars, who were seen as [[gender bending]], including [[Philip Oakey|Phil Oakey]]'s asymmetric hair and use of eyeliner, [[Marc Almond]]'s "pervy" leather jacket, skirt wearing by figures including [[Martin Gore]] of Depeche Mode and the early "[[dominatrix]]" image of the Eurythmics' [[Annie Lennox]]. In the U.S. this led to British synth-pop artists being characterised as "English haircut bands" or "art [[faggot (slang)|fag]]" music,<ref name="Reynolds2005p337"/> though many British synth-pop artists were highly popular on both American radio and [[MTV]]. Although some audiences were overtly hostile to synth-pop, it achieved an appeal among those alienated from the dominant heterosexuality of mainstream rock culture, particularly among gay, female and introverted audiences.<ref name="Reynolds2005p337">{{citation|title=Rip It Up and Start Again Postpunk 1978–1984 |author=S.
