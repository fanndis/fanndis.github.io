==Charitable work: public health and education advocacy==

===Focus on maternal, newborn and child health [MNCH] and education===
In 2002, Brown founded the charity Theirworld – originally known as PiggyBankKids – which began as a research fund to tackle complications in pregnancy, and in 2004 the charity founded the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory at the [[University of Edinburgh School of Informatics|University of Edinburgh]]. The laboratory's work is notable for its unified obstetric and neonatal approach to complications in pregnancy and childbirth, with a particular focus on preterm births.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crh.ed.ac.uk/the-jennifer-brown-research-laboratory-2/ |title=University of Edinburgh MRC Centre for Reproductive Health: The Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory |date=19 April 2014 |access-date=6 August 2014 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820001154/http://www.crh.ed.ac.uk/the-jennifer-brown-research-laboratory-2/ |archive-date=20 August 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 16 November 2015, Brown launched the Theirworld Birth Cohort project, a £1.5million study aimed at improving the health of women and their children who are born prematurely, at Edinburgh University as part of the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Launch of the Edinburgh Birth Cohort Study {{!}} Upcoming Events {{!}} |url=https://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/clinical-brain-sciences/news/upcoming-events/edinburgh-birth-cohort-launch |website=webcache.googleusercontent.com |access-date=24 November 2015 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The project will track the development of 400 babies, most of whom are born before 32 weeks, following them through to adulthood, tracking educational attainment to help identify the causes and consequences of brain injury at birth and help speed the development of new treatments that could improve the health of prematurely born babies.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Premature babies care study launched by Sarah Brown – BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-34832194 |website=BBC News |access-date=24 November 2015 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120125439/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-34832194 |archive-date=20 January 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Sarah Brown launches £1.5m study into premature births |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/sarah-brown-launches-1-5m-study-into-premature-births-1-3949723 |website=www.scotsman.com |access-date=24 November 2015 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124172642/http://www.scotsman.com/news/sarah-brown-launches-1-5m-study-into-premature-births-1-3949723 |archive-date=24 November 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Sarah Brown launches £1.5m premature babies care study – BelfastTelegraph.co.uk |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/sarah-brown-launches-15m-premature-babies-care-study-34204321.html |website=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk |access-date=24 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Sarah Brown launches £1.5 million premature babies care study |url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/scotland/sarah-brown-launches-1-5-million-premature-babies-care-study-1.910608 |website=www.thecourier.co.uk |access-date=24 November 2015 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118105341/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/scotland/sarah-brown-launches-1-5-million-premature-babies-care-study-1.910608 |archive-date=18 November 2015 }}</ref>

Theirworld, which was launched in early 2013 through the ''A World at School'' digital movement, also has a strong focus on global education. As well as the #UpForSchool petition, it also organised the first ever "youth takeover" of the United Nations in July 2013,<ref>{{Cite web |title=RESULTS {{!}} Blog {{!}} Malala and Youth Take Over the UN on 12 July|url = http://www.results.org/blog/malala_and_youth_take_over_the_un_on_july_12th/|website = www.results.org|access-date = 24 November 2015|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151124143025/http://www.results.org/blog/malala_and_youth_take_over_the_un_on_july_12th/|archive-date = 24 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=United Nations Girls' Education Initiative – Global Section – Malala Day: UN Youth Takeover |url=http://www.ungei.org/247_3236.html |website=UNGEI |access-date=24 November 2015 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081452/http://www.ungei.org/247_3236.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> and has campaigned on the provision of education to children effected by conflict and disaster, particularly including refugees of the Syria crisis in Lebanon.

In 2008 Brown became global patron of [[White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood|The White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood]], the grassroots led maternal health advocacy movement, and co-founded the Maternal Mortality Campaign.

Brown chaired the launch of the "new consensus for maternal, newborn and child health" at a 2009 high level event at the United Nations.  At the meeting 10 countries, including [[Sierra Leone]], [[Ghana]] and [[Liberia]], declared that they would be dropping medical charges ("[[user fees]]") to pregnant women around the time of birth.  The consensus also set out key action steps that research showed could save the lives of more than 10 million women and children by 2015, and that were endorsed by the G8 at their July meeting of that year.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |title=Behind the Black Door |last=Brown |first=Sarah |publisher=Ebury Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780091940584 |pages=rear cover}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.who.int/pmnch/media/events/2009/20090923_mnchconsensusstory/en/index1.html |title=World Health Organisation: Investing in Our Common Future: Healthy Women, Healthy Children, Quotes and Commitments |date=23 September 2009 |access-date=7 August 2015 |website=WHO |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701165717/http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/events/2009/20090923_mnchconsensusstory/en/index1.html |archive-date=1 July 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Spouse of the Prime Minister===

[[Gordon Brown]] became Prime Minister on 27 June 2007, following the resignation of [[Tony Blair]]. As wife of the Prime Minister, Sarah Brown was generally viewed favourably.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7628151.stm |title=PM's wife is a hit on the fringe |author=Emma Griffiths |work=BBC News |date=21 September 2008 |access-date=23 September 2008 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922133057/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7628151.stm |archive-date=22 September 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=A1YourView&xml=/opinion/2008/07/30/do3005.xml |title=What Sarah Brown could learn from Cherie Blair |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |author=Liz Hunt |date=30 July 2008 |access-date=23 September 2008 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6240852.stm |title=Sarah Brown: The new 'first lady' |work=BBC News |date=28 June 2007 |access-date=23 September 2008 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203074802/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6240852.stm |archive-date=3 February 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted her public image, describing her as "a truly modern public figure: talkative, empathetic, informal but infinitely connected, ubiquitous as any celebrity, an avid exploiter of new digital media, an expert assembler of charitable and political coalitions",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/25/women-gordon-brown |title=The Guardian |date=25 September 2009 |access-date=7 August 2014 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024072343/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/25/women-gordon-brown |archive-date=24 October 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> noting "her positive profile could be the best thing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] has got going for it with the election looming."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2009/sep/24/sarah-brown-popular-twitter?picture=353403929 |title=The Reinvention of Sarah Brown |work=The Guardian |date=24 September 2009 |access-date=29 September 2009 |location=London |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214232143/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2009/sep/24/sarah-brown-popular-twitter?picture=353403929 |archive-date=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>  ''[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]]'' noted that " It is hard to find people with a bad word to say about Mrs Brown."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5284216/Sarah-Brown-campaigning-for-safe-motherhood.html |title=The Telegraph |date=6 May 2009 |access-date=7 August 2014 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812093645/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5284216/Sarah-Brown-campaigning-for-safe-motherhood.html |archive-date=12 August 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

According to [[Anthony Seldon]] and Guy Lodge, the authors of a book on Gordon's tenure as Prime Minister, Sarah brought stability to both Gordon and his office, and was "a forceful voice in encouraging him to stay on until the very end".<ref name="Seldon"/> That end came following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]], which resulted in the first hung parliament since 1974. The Conservative Party led by [[David Cameron]] won the most seats, and on 11 May 2010 formed a government in [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition|coalition with the Liberal Democrats]] after her husband's attempts to keep Labour in power failed.

===Memoir===
[[Image:34th G8 summit member's spouses 20080708 2.jpg|thumb|left|Brown with other leader spouses at the [[34th G8 summit]] (2008)]]
Brown published a memoir of her role as the Prime Minister's spouse, entitled ''Behind the Black Door'', through Ebury Press in 2011.<ref name=":1">{{cite book |title=Behind the Black Door |url=https://archive.org/details/behindblackdoor0000brow |url-access=registration |author=Sarah Brown |publisher=Ebury Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780091940577}}</ref>

The book received a mixed reception from reviewers. Written in a diary style, the ''New Statesman'' referred to it as a "domestic take on politics".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2011/03/sarah-brown-public-family |title=Behind the Black Door |date=17 March 2011 |work=New Statesman |access-date=17 October 2014 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021185925/http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2011/03/sarah-brown-public-family |archive-date=21 October 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> While ''[[Woman's Own]]'' called it "fascinating and endearing",<ref name=":2" /> the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' described it as "perhaps the dimmest diary ever to have been professionally published" and "one long, formulaic press release in praise of [[Gordon Brown]]."<ref name="ES Review">David Sexton (10 March 2011), [https://www.standard.co.uk/arts/book/behind-the-black-door-is-inobservant-imperceptive-and-dull-6576211.html "Behind the Black Door is inobservant, imperceptive and dull"], ''London Evening Standard''. Retrieved 18 June 2013.</ref>

''The Telegraph'' concludes it is a "strange book" and "plea for redemption" though the reviewer decides that Brown's description of the international charity circuit is "fun at last",<ref name="Torygraph Review">Tanya Gold (5 March 2011), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8362135/Behind-the-Black-Door-by-Sarah-Brown-review.html "Behind the Black Door by Sarah Brown: review"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006142711/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8362135/Behind-the-Black-Door-by-Sarah-Brown-review.html |date=6 October 2013 }}, ''The Telegraph''. Retrieved 18 June 2013.</ref> and that Brown "wins sympathy that boastfulness would have forfeited."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherhowse/8339431/Sarah-Brown-never-has-the-last-laugh....html |title=The Telegraph |date=21 February 2011 |access-date=7 August 2014 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812093700/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherhowse/8339431/Sarah-Brown-never-has-the-last-laugh....html |archive-date=12 August 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The ''[[Irish Independent]]'' describes the book as a "disturbingly giddy, schoolgirlish, exclamation mark-littered diary form" and "nothing in the slightest bit revelatory about it... tiptoeingly discreet", but that "Brown comes across in these pages as a decent and likeable" with "enough gossipy details to satisfy star-hungry readers",<ref name="Irish Indy Review">[http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books-arts/review-behind-the-black-door-by-sarah-brown-26712873.html "Review: Behind The Black Door by Sarah Brown"], ''Irish Independent'', 5 March 2011. Retrieved 18 June 2013.</ref> with Caitlin Moran declaring: "School run, conference call, Obama for tea – Sarah Brown smiled, and tweeted, through it all. I love this woman."<ref name=":1" />

The ''New Statesman'' observed that Brown successfully describes "the awkwardness of the lifestyle" and "the vagueness of the position", and that while "political events and what must have been some fairly traumatic personal moments" seem "airbrushed", leaving "the diary feeling a little empty", the book demonstrates how "collision of the political with the personal... jars and is sometimes funny", concluding it is full of "thoughtfulness and... courtesy", "precisely the sort of thing that is genuine Sarah Brown".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2011/03/sarah-brown-public-family |title=New Statesman, Behind the Black Door, Alice Miles |date=17 March 2011 |access-date=7 August 2014 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021185925/http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2011/03/sarah-brown-public-family |archive-date=21 October 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Commenting on some of the reaction to the book, [[David Mitchell (comedian)|David Mitchell]] noted in ''The Guardian'' that "The amount of crap we expect prime ministers' wives to endure, unpaid, for having the temerity to be married to the country's most successful politician is a national disgrace",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/27/david-mitchell-sarah-brown-barclays |title=The Guardian, "So Sarah Brown didn't make Gordon a boiled egg and soldiers.
