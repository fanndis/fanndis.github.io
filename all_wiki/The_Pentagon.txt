'''The Pentagon''' is the headquarters building of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. As a symbol of the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]], the phrase ''The Pentagon'' is also often used as a [[metonym]] for the Department of Defense and its leadership.

Located in [[Arlington County, Virginia]]<!--Arlington is a county, and this must be conveyed by including the "county"-->, across the [[Potomac River]] from [[Washington, D.C.]], the building was designed by American architect [[George Bergstrom]] and built by contractor [[John McShain]]. Ground was broken on 11 September 1941, and the building was dedicated on 15 January 1943. General [[Brehon Somervell]] provided the major motivating power behind the project;<ref>{{cite book |last = Vogel |first = Steve |title = The Pentagon&nbsp;– A History: The Untold Story of the Wartime Race to Build the Pentagon and to Restore it Sixty Years Later |year = 2007 |publisher = Random House |isbn = 978-0-8129-7325-9 |page = }}{{page needed|date=May 2020}}</ref> Colonel [[Leslie Groves]] was responsible for overseeing the project for the [[U.S. Army]].

On [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], exactly sixty years after the building's construction began, [[American Airlines Flight 77]] was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] and flown into the western side of the building, killing 189 people (59 victims and the five terrorists on board the airliner, as well as 125 victims in the building), according to the [[9/11 Commission Report]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.pentagon.mil/home/features/2008/0908_dedication/ |work = DefenseLink.mil |title = Pentagon Memorial Dedication |access-date = 27 May 2009 }}</ref> It was the first significant foreign attack on Washington's governmental facilities since [[Burning of Washington|the city was burned]] by the British during the [[War of 1812]].

The Pentagon building spans {{convert|28.7|acre|m2|abbr=on}}, and includes an additional {{convert|5.1|acre|m2|abbr=on}} as a central courtyard.<ref name="Goldberg 1992, p. 57">{{cite book |last = Goldberg |first = Alfred |title = The Pentagon: The First Fifty Years |publisher = Office of the Secretary of Defense / Government Printing Office |year = 1992 |isbn = 0-16-037979-2 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/pentagonthefirst00wash |page = 57 }}</ref> Starting with the north side and moving [[clockwise]], its five façade entrances are the Mall Terrace, the River Terrace, the Concourse (or Metro Station), the South Parking, and the Heliport.<ref name=global/> On the north side of the building, the Mall Entrance, which also features a portico, leads out to a {{convert|600|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} terrace that is used for ceremonies. The River Entrance, which features a [[portico]] projecting out {{convert|20|ft|0|spell=in}}, is on the northeast side, overlooking the lagoon and facing Washington. A stepped terrace on the River Entrance leads down to the lagoon; and a landing dock was used until the late 1960s to ferry personnel between [[Bolling Air Force Base]] and the Pentagon.<ref name="Goldberg 1992, p. 57"/> The main entrance for visitors is on the southeast side, as are the [[Pentagon (Washington Metro)|Pentagon Metro station]] and the bus station. There is also a concourse on the southeast side of the second floor of the building, which contains a mini-shopping mall. The south parking lot adjoins the southwest facade, and the west side of the Pentagon faces [[Washington Boulevard (Arlington)|Washington Boulevard]].

The concentric rings are designated from the center out as "A" through "E" (with additional "F" and "G" rings in the basement). "E" Ring offices are the only ones with outside views and are generally occupied by senior officials. Office numbers go clockwise around each of the rings, and have two parts: a nearest-corridor number (1 to 10) followed by a bay number (00 to 99), so office numbers range from 100 to 1099. These corridors radiate out from the central courtyard, with corridor 1 beginning with the Concourse's south end. Each numbered radial corridor intersects with the corresponding numbered group of offices (for example, corridor 5 divides the 500 series office block). There are a number of historical displays in the building, particularly in the "A" and "E" rings.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Floors in the Pentagon are lettered "B" for Basement and "M" for [[Mezzanine (architecture)|Mezzanine]], both of which are below ground level. The concourse is on the second floor at the Metro entrance. Above ground floors are numbered 1 to 5. Room numbers are given as the floor, concentric ring, and office number (which is in turn the nearest corridor number followed by the bay number). Thus, office 2B315 is on the second floor, B ring, and nearest to corridor 3 (between corridors 2 and 3). One way to get to this office would be to go to the second floor, get to the A (innermost) ring, go to and take corridor 3, and then turn left on ring B to get to bay 15.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.hqda.army.mil/aoguide/Pentagon_Map.htm |title = How to Find a Room in the Pentagon |access-date = 13 September 2007 |publisher = Headquarters, Dept. of the Army |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070921023919/http://www.hqda.army.mil/aoguide/Pentagon_Map.htm |archive-date = 21 September 2007 }}</ref>

==History==
===Background===
[[File:Mainnavy-munitions.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Main Navy Building (foreground) and the [[Munitions Building]] were temporary structures built during [[World War I]] on the [[National Mall]]. The Department of War headquarters was in the Munitions Building for several years before moving into the Pentagon.]][[File:Pentagon road network map 1945.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|1945 map of the [[Pentagon road network]], including present-day [[State Route 27 (Virginia)|State Route 27]] and part of the [[Shirley Highway]], as well as the [[Main Navy and Munitions Buildings]] near the [[Lincoln Memorial]]]]

Before the Pentagon was built, the [[United States Department of War]] was headquartered in the [[Munitions Building]], a temporary structure erected during [[World War I]] along [[Constitution Avenue]] on the [[National Mall]]. The War Department, which was a civilian agency created to administer the [[U.S. Army]], was spread out in additional temporary buildings on the National Mall, as well as dozens of other buildings in Washington, D.C., [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. In the late 1930s, a [[Harry S Truman Building|new War Department Building]] was constructed at 21st and C Streets in [[Foggy Bottom]] but, upon completion, the new building did not solve the department's space problem and ended up being used by the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]].<ref>{{harvp|Goldberg|1992|pp=6–9|ps=.}}</ref> When [[World War II]] broke out in Europe, the War Department rapidly expanded in anticipation that the United States would be drawn into the conflict. Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]] found the situation unacceptable, with the Munitions Building overcrowded and the department spread out.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/Sw-SA/Intro.htm |title = Intro&nbsp;– Secretaries of War and Secretaries of the Army |publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] |year = 1992 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/pl-usa/pl-dc/nav-fac/mn-mun.htm |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20011005072618/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/pl-usa/pl-dc/nav-fac/mn-mun.htm |url-status = dead |archive-date = 5 October 2001 |title = Main Navy & Munitions Buildings |publisher = [[Naval History & Heritage Command]] |access-date = 17 October 2008 }}</ref>

Stimson told U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in May 1941 that the War Department needed additional space. On 17 July 1941, a congressional hearing took place, organized by Virginia congressman [[Clifton Woodrum]], regarding proposals for new War Department buildings. Woodrum pressed Brigadier General [[Eugene Reybold]], who was representing the War Department at the hearing, for an "overall solution" to the department's "space problem" rather than building yet more temporary buildings. Reybold agreed to report back to the congressman within five days. The War Department called upon its construction chief, General [[Brehon Somervell]], to come up with a plan.<ref>{{harvp|Vogel|2007|pp=29–33|ps=.}}</ref>

===Planning===
Government officials agreed that the War Department building, officially designated Federal Office Building No 1, should be constructed across the [[Potomac River]], in [[Arlington County, Virginia]]. Requirements for the new building were that it be no more than four stories tall, and that it use a minimal amount of steel. The requirements meant that, instead of rising vertically, the building would be sprawling over a large area. Possible sites for the building included the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Arlington Experimental Farm]], adjacent to [[Arlington National Cemetery]], and the obsolete [[Hoover Field]] site.<ref>{{harvp|Vogel|2007|pp=35–37|ps=.}}</ref>

The site originally chosen was [[Arlington Farms]], which had a roughly pentagonal shape, so the building was planned accordingly as an irregular pentagon.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.roadstothefuture.com/Shirley_Highway.html#Pentagon_Road_System |title = Bureau of Public Roads memorandum |date = 25 October 1960 }}{{full|date=May 2020}}</ref> Concerned that the new building could obstruct the view of Washington, D.C., from Arlington Cemetery, President Roosevelt ended up selecting the Hoover Airport site instead.<ref>{{cite web |title = General Information |url = http://www.dtic.mil/ref/html/Welcome/general.html |access-date = 4 December 2005 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051129013448/http://www.dtic.mil/ref/html/Welcome/general.html |archive-date = 29 November 2005 }}</ref> The building retained its pentagonal layout because a major redesign at that stage would have been costly, and Roosevelt liked the design. Freed of the constraints of the asymmetric Arlington Farms site, it was modified into a [[Regular polygon|regular]] [[pentagon]], which resembled the [[Fortification#Development after introduction of firearms|fortifications of the gunpowder age]].<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/23/AR2007052301296_pf.html |title = How the Pentagon Got Its Shape |first = Steve |last = Vogel |date = 27 May 2007 |page = W16 |work = The Washington Post |access-date = 26 May 2007 }}</ref>

On 28 July, [[77th United States Congress|Congress]] authorized funding for a new Department of War building in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], which would house the entire department under one roof,<ref>{{harvp|Goldberg|1992|p=22|ps=.}}</ref> and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] officially approved of the Hoover Airport site on 2 September.<ref name="goldberg1992">{{harvp|Goldberg|1992|p=33|ps=.}}</ref> While the project went through the approval process in late July 1941, Somervell selected the contractors, including John McShain, Inc. of [[Philadelphia]], which had built [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington National Airport]] in Arlington, the [[Jefferson Memorial]] in Washington, and the [[National Naval Medical Center]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], along with Wise Contracting Company, Inc. and Doyle and Russell, both from Virginia.<ref>{{harvp|Goldberg|1992|p=29|ps=.}}</ref> In addition to the Hoover Airport site and other government-owned land, construction of the Pentagon required an additional {{convert|287|acre|km2}}, which were acquired at a cost of $2.2&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|2200000|1941}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}).<ref name="goldberg-p34">{{harvp|Goldberg|1992|p=34|ps=.}}</ref> The Hell's Bottom neighborhood, consisting of numerous pawnshops, factories, approximately 150 homes, and other buildings around [[Virginia State Route 244|Columbia Pike]], was also cleared to make way for the Pentagon.<ref>{{harvp|Vogel|2007|p=131|ps.=}}</ref> Later, {{convert|300|acre|km2|abbr=on}} of land were transferred to [[Arlington National Cemetery]] and to [[Fort Myer]], leaving {{convert|280|acre|km2|abbr=on}} for the Pentagon.<ref name="goldberg-p34" />

===Construction===

Contracts totaling $31,100,000 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|31100000|1941}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) were finalized with McShain and the other contractors on 11 September, and ground was broken for the Pentagon the same day.<ref>{{harvp|Goldberg|1992|pp=35, 44|ps=.}}</ref> Among the design requirements, Somervell required the structural design to accommodate floor loads of up to {{convert|150|psi}}, which was done in case the building became a records storage facility at some time after the end of the current war.<ref name="goldberg1992" /> A minimal amount of steel was used as it was in short supply during World War II. Instead, the Pentagon was built as a reinforced concrete structure, using 680,000 tons of sand dredged from the [[Potomac River]], and a lagoon was created beneath the Pentagon's river entrance.<ref>{{cite news |title = Rare, Unseen: Building the Pentagon |work = Life |url = http://www.life.com/gallery/63331/rare-unseen-building-the-pentagon#index/4 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110926133401/http://www.life.com/gallery/63331/rare-unseen-building-the-pentagon#index/4 |archive-date = 26 September 2011 }}</ref> To minimize steel usage, concrete ramps were built rather than installing elevators.<ref>{{cite news |title = How The Pentagon Got Its Shape (Gallery) |work = The Washington Post |date = 26 May 2007 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/gallery/070524/GAL-07May24-75314/index.html?hpid=artslot |author = McGrath, Amanda }}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Goldberg|1992|pp=52–53|ps.=}}</ref> [[Indiana limestone]] was used for the building's façade.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Owens |first = Jim |title = Replacing the stone and rebuilding the Pentagon |journal = Mining Engineering |date = February 2005 |volume = 57 |pages = 21–26 |issue = 2 }}</ref>

Architectural and structural design work for the Pentagon proceeded simultaneously with construction, with initial drawings provided in early October&nbsp;1941, and most of the design work completed by 1&nbsp;June&nbsp;1942. At times the construction work got ahead of the design, with different materials used than specified in the plans. Pressure to speed up design and construction intensified after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7&nbsp;December&nbsp;1941, with Somervell demanding that {{convert|1000000|ft2|ha|abbr=on}} of space at the Pentagon be available for occupation by 1 April 1943.<ref>{{harvp|Goldberg|1992|pp=39–42|ps=.}}</ref> David J. Witmer replaced Bergstrom as chief architect on 11&nbsp;April after Bergstrom resigned due to charges, unrelated to the Pentagon project, of improper conduct while he was president of the [[American Institute of Architects]].<ref>{{harvp|Goldberg|1992|p=36|ps.=}}</ref> Construction was completed 15&nbsp;January&nbsp;1943.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://pentagontours.osd.mil/construction.jsp |title = Construction to  Completion |work = The Pentagon Tours |publisher = United States Department of Defense |access-date = 20 July 2016 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160403075357/https://pentagontours.osd.mil/construction.jsp |archive-date = 3 April 2016 }}</ref>

Soil conditions of the site{{snd}}on the [[Potomac River]] floodplain{{snd}}presented challenges, as did the varying [[elevation]]s across the site, which ranged from {{convert|10|to|40|ft|0|spell=in}} above [[sea level]]. Two retaining walls were built to compensate for the elevation variations, and cast-in-place piles were used to deal with the soil conditions.<ref>{{harvp|Goldberg|1992|pp= 47, 52|ps.=}}</ref> Construction of the Pentagon was completed in approximately 16 months at a total cost of $83&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|83000000|1941}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}). The building's approximate height is {{convert|71|ft}}, and each of the five sides is {{convert|921|ft}} in&nbsp;length.<ref name="tours" />

The building was built one wing at a time; each wing was occupied as soon as it was completed, even as construction continued on the remaining wings.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The Pentagon was designed in accordance with the [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] laws in force in the state of Virginia at the time, with separate eating and lavatory accommodations for white and black persons; the sets of lavatories were side by side, and the dining areas for black persons were in the basement.<ref>{{Cite book |first = Robert R. |last = Weyeneth |title = The Architecture of Racial Segregation: The Challenges of Preserving the Problematical Past |date = 2005 |pages = 28&ndash;30 }}</ref><ref name="Carroll, James 2006. p.4-5">{{cite book |last = Carroll |first = James |title = House of War: The Pentagon and the Disastrous Rise of American Power |year = 2007 |publisher = Mariner Books |isbn = 978-0-618-18780-5 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/houseofwartextei00carr |pages = 4–5 }}</ref> However, when Roosevelt visited the facility before its dedication, he ordered removal of the "Whites Only" signs, and the Pentagon became the only building in Virginia where segregation laws (which remained in force until 1965) were not enforced.

===Renovation===
{{Main|Pentagon Renovation Program}}

From 1998 to 2011, the Pentagon was completely gutted and reconstructed in phases to bring it up to modern standards and improve security and efficiency. [[Asbestos]] was removed and all office windows sealed.<ref>{{cite news |work = The Washington Post |last = Vogel |first = Steve |title = New Pentagon Is A Paragon |date = 22 June 2011 |page = 1 }}</ref>

As originally built, most Pentagon office space consisted of open bays which spanned an entire ring. These offices used [[Ventilation (architecture)|cross-ventilation]] from operable windows instead of air conditioning for cooling. Gradually, bays were subdivided into private offices with many using [[Air conditioner|window air conditioning units]]. With renovations now complete, the new space includes a return to open office bays, a new Universal Space Plan of standardized office furniture and partitions developed by Studios Architecture.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://renovation.pentagon.mil/wedge2-5/usp.htm |title = Renovation of the Pentagon |access-date = 9 October 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061004013300/http://renovation.pentagon.mil/wedge2-5/usp.htm |archive-date = 4 October 2006 }}</ref>

===11 September 2001 attacks===

On [[11 September 2001]], coincidentally the 60th anniversary of the Pentagon's groundbreaking, five [[al-Qaeda]] affiliated hijackers took control of [[American Airlines Flight 77]], ''en route'' from [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] to [[Los Angeles International Airport]], and deliberately crashed the [[Boeing 757]] airliner into the western side of the Pentagon at 9:37&nbsp;am EDT as part of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The impact of the plane severely damaged the outer ring of one wing of the building and caused its partial collapse.<ref>{{Cite news |title = The Hijackers We Let Escape |first = Michael |last = Isikoff |author2 = Daniel Klaidman |url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/64762 |newspaper = Newsweek |date = 10 June 2002 |access-date = 22 October 2009 }}</ref> At the time of the attacks, the Pentagon was under renovation and many offices were unoccupied, resulting in fewer casualties. Only 800 of 4,500 people who would have been in the area were there because of the work. Furthermore, the area hit, on the side of the Heliport facade, was the section best prepared for such an attack. The renovation there, improvements which resulted from the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], had nearly been completed.<ref name=Schrader>{{Cite news |title = Pentagon, a Vulnerable Building, Was Hit in Least Vulnerable Spot |first = Esther |last = Schrader |url = http://911research.wtc7.net/cache/pentagon/analysis/latimes_leastvulnerable.html |newspaper = Los Angeles Times |date = 16 September 2001 |access-date = 25 February 2010 }}</ref><ref name=global>{{cite web |url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/pentagon.htm |title = The Pentagon |publisher = globalsecurity.org |access-date = 25 February 2010 }}</ref><ref name="latimes2001">{{cite web |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2001/sep/16/news/mn-46435 |title = Where The Pentagon Was Hit |work = LA Times |access-date = 21 June 2015 }}</ref>

It was the only area of the Pentagon with a sprinkler system, and it had been reconstructed with a web of steel columns and bars to withstand bomb blasts. The steel reinforcement, bolted together to form a continuous structure through all of the Pentagon's five floors, kept that section of the building from collapsing for 30 minutes—enough time for hundreds of people to crawl out to safety. The area struck by the plane also had blast-resistant windows—2 inches thick and 2,500 pounds each—that stayed intact during the crash and fire. It had fire doors that opened automatically and newly built exits that allowed people to get out.<ref name="latimes2001" />

Contractors already involved with the renovation were given the added task of rebuilding the sections damaged in the attacks. This additional project was named the "[[Phoenix Project (Pentagon)|Phoenix Project]]," and was charged with having the outermost offices of the damaged section occupied by 11 September 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title = Pentagon Renovation Program |url = http://renovation.pentagon.mil/Phoenix/Phoenix.htm |access-date = 4 December 2005 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060508074544/http://renovation.pentagon.mil/Phoenix/Phoenix.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 8 May 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher = BBC News |title = Americas: Pentagon staff reclaim destroyed offices |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2196233.stm |access-date = 4 December 2005 |date = 15 August 2002 |first = Nick |last = Childs }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://pentagon.osd.mil/september11.html |title = Pentagon History&nbsp;– September 11, 2001 |publisher = Pentagon.osd.mil |access-date = 26 October 2008 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110926221109/http://pentagon.osd.mil/september11.html |archive-date = 26 September 2011 }}</ref>

When the damaged section of the Pentagon was repaired, a small indoor memorial and chapel were added at the point of impact. For the fifth anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks, a memorial of 184 beams of light shone up from the center courtyard of the Pentagon, one light for each victim of the attack. In addition, an American flag is hung each year on the side of the Pentagon damaged in the attacks, and the side of the building is illuminated at night with blue lights. After the attacks, plans were developed for an outdoor memorial, with construction underway in 2006. This [[Pentagon Memorial]] consists of a park on {{convert|2|acre|m2|abbr=on}} of land, containing 184 benches, one dedicated to each victim. The benches are aligned along the line of Flight 77 according to the victims' ages, from 3 to 71. The park opened to the public on 11 September 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://memorial.pentagon.mil/ |title = Pentagon Memorial |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090109173706/http://memorial.pentagon.mil/ |archive-date = 9 January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url = http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2003/nr20030806-0326.html |title = Contractor Selected for the Pentagon Memorial |publisher = United States Department of Defense |date = 6 August 2003 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060511124900/http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2003/nr20030806-0326.html |archive-date = 11 May 2006 |id = 576-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first = Debbie |last = Wilgoren |first2 = Nick |last2 = Miroff |first3 = Robin |last3 = Shulman |title = Pentagon Memorial Dedicated on 7th Anniversary of Attacks |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/11/AR2008091100579.html?hpid=topnews |work = The Washington Post |date = 11 September 2008 |access-date = 11 September 2008 }}</ref>
