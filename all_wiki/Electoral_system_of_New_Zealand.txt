The '''New Zealand electoral system''' has been [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) since 1996. MMP was introduced after a referendum in [[1993 New Zealand voting method referendum#1993 electoral referendum|1993]]. MMP replaced the [[First-past-the-post electoral system|first-past-the-post]] (FPP) system New Zealand had previously used for most of its history.

New Zealand has a single-house legislature, the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], usually with 120 members, although the number can increase because of (generally) one or two [[overhang seat]]s, depending on the outcome of the electoral process. The 52nd Parliament, elected in 2017, has 120 seats: 71 were filled by [[Results of the 2017 New Zealand general election#Electorate results|electorate MPs]], with the remaining 49 from [[Party lists in the 2017 New Zealand general election|ranked party lists]]. The term of the [[New Zealand Parliament]] is set at three years. The last election was held on [[2020 New Zealand general election|17 October 2020]].

In 1893, New Zealand was the first country in the world to give [[women's suffrage in New Zealand|women the right to vote]]. This meant that theoretically, New Zealand had [[universal suffrage]] from 1893, meaning all adults 21 years of age and older were allowed to vote (in 1969 the voting age was lowered from 21 to 20. It was lowered again to 18 in 1974).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/voting-rights|title=Voting Rights|last=Atkinson|first=Neil|date=17 May 2018|website=Te Ara- The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=10 May 2018}}</ref> However, the voting rules that applied to the European settlers did not apply to [[Māori people|Māori]], and their situation is still unique in that [[Māori electorates|a number of seats]] in the New Zealand Parliament are elected by Māori voters alone.

In contemporary New Zealand, generally all permanent residents and citizens over 18 are eligible to vote. The main exceptions are when a person has been living overseas continuously for too long, has been detained in a psychiatric hospital for more than three years after being charged with a criminal offence, or since 2010, is currently a sentenced prisoner.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elections.org.nz/voters/enrol-check-or-update-now/who-can-and-cant-enrol | title=Who can and can't enrol? | publisher=Electoral Commission | accessdate=4 September 2014 | author=New Zealand Electoral Commission}}</ref>

== Term of parliament ==
Although Parliamentary elections are held every three years, this has not always been the case. In New Zealand's early colonial history, elections were held every five years – as established by The New Zealand Constitution Act of 1852. The term was reduced to three years in 1879 because of concerns about the growing power of central Government.<ref name="The term of parliament">{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/Chapter%206%20the%20term%20of%20parliament.pdf |title=The term of parliament |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=4 April 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150125030327/http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/Chapter%206%20the%20term%20of%20parliament.pdf |archive-date=25 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Since then, the term has been altered three times – mainly in times of international crisis. During the First World War it was extended to five years. In the early 1930s, it was pushed out to four years. This proved to be unpopular with the electorate and after the election of 1935, the term was reduced to three years again. It was extended to four years once again during the Second World War, but returned to three years afterwards. In 1956, the term of three years was '[[Entrenched legislation|entrenched]]' in the Electoral Act which means that it can only be changed by achieving a majority in a national referendum or by a vote of 75% of all members of Parliament.<ref name="The term of parliament"/>

In 2013 the Government established an advisory panel to conduct a review of constitutional issues – including an examination of the term of parliament. Other issues discussed at public meetings held by the panel were the number of MPs New Zealand should have, whether a written constitution is needed, and whether all legislation should be consistent with the Bill of Rights Act.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.justice.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Publications/Constitutional-Advisory-Panel-Full-Report-2013.pdf|title=Constitutional Advisory Panel Full Report|last=|first=|date=November 2013|website=www.justice.govt.nz|publisher=Nzherald.co.nz|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref> Both Prime Minister [[John Key]] and Opposition leader [[David Shearer]] expressed support for an extension of the parliamentary term to four years.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10864096 |title=Editorial: Four year term better for country |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date=8 February 2013 |accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> The main argument put forward in support of a longer term is that "Governments need time to establish and then implement new policies".

The last referendum on the term of parliament was in 1990 and found nearly 70% of the voters were opposed to extending the term. An opinion poll on the news website [[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] in early 2013 found that of 3,882 respondents, 61% were in favour of changing to a four-year term.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mace |first=William |title=Support from business for longer terms |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/8371855/Support-from-business-for-longer-terms |accessdate=7 March 2013 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=2 March 2013}}</ref>

== Māori seats ==
{{Main|Māori electorates}}
A unique feature of New Zealand's electoral system is that a number of seats in Parliament are reserved exclusively for [[Māori people|Māori]]. However, this was not always the case. In the early colonial era, Māori could not vote in elections unless they owned land as individuals. European colonists were quite happy with this state of affairs because, according to NZ History online, "they did not think Māori were yet 'civilised' enough to exercise such an important responsibility".<ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"/> At the time, Māori were dealing directly with the Crown in regard to the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] and had little interest in the 'pākehā parliament'.<ref name="nzhistory.net.nz">{{cite web |url= https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/maori-and-the-vote/setting-up-seats |title=Māori and the vote: Setting up the Māori seats |website=New Zealand History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |date=28 November 2016 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref>

During the [[New Zealand wars|wars of the 1860s]], some settlers began to realise it was necessary to bring Māori into the British system if the two sides were to get along. After much debate, in 1867 Parliament passed the Maori Representation Act, which established four electorates solely for Māori. The four Māori seats were a very minor concession; the settlers had 72 seats at the time and, on a per capita basis, Māori should have got up to 16 seats.<ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"/> All Māori men (but not women) over the age of 21 were given the right to vote and to stand for Parliament.

Full-blooded Māori had to vote in the Māori seats and only Māori with mixed parentage ('half-castes') were allowed to choose whether they voted in European electorates or Māori electorates. This dual voting system continued until 1975.<ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"/> From time to time there was public discussion about whether New Zealand still needed separate seats for Māori – which some considered to be a form of apartheid. Māori were only allowed to stand for election in European seats (or general electorates) from 1967.

In 1985, a [[Royal Commission on the Electoral System]] was established. It concluded that "separate seats had not helped Maori and that they would achieve better representation through a proportional party-list system". The Commission recommended that if mixed-member proportional (MMP) system was adopted, the Māori seats should be abolished. However, most Māori wanted to keep them and the seats were not only retained under MMP, their "number would now increase or decrease according to the results (population numbers) of the regular Māori electoral option". As a result, in 1996 before the first MMP election, the number of Māori seats increased to five – the first increase in 129 years. In 2002, it went up to seven.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url= https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/maori-and-the-vote/twentieth-century |title=Māori and the vote: Change in the 20th century |website=New Zealand History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |date=12 July 2016 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref>

==Developments in voting rights and eligibility==
=== Secret ballot ===
In European seats, the secret ballot was introduced in 1870.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> However, Māori continued to use a verbal system – whereby electors had to tell the polling official which candidate they wanted to vote for. Māori were not allowed a secret ballot until 1938 and even voted on a different day. According to NZ History online: "Up until 1951 Maori voted on a different day from Europeans, often several weeks later." It was not until 1951 that voting in the four Māori electorates was held on the same day as voting in the general election.<ref>{{cite book  |last= Wilson |first= James Oakley |title= New Zealand Parliamentary Record, 1840–1984 |edition= 4th |origyear= First ed. published 1913 |year= 1985 |publisher=V.R. Ward, Govt. Printer |location= Wellington |oclc=154283103 |page=138}}</ref>

NZ History also states: "There were also no electoral rolls for the Maori seats. Electoral officials had always argued that it would be too difficult to register Maori voters (supposedly because of difficulties with language, literacy and proof of identity). Despite frequent allegations of electoral irregularities in the Maori seats, rolls were not used until the 1949 election."<ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"/>

=== Women's suffrage ===
{{main|Women's suffrage in New Zealand}}
In early colonial New Zealand, as in most Western countries, women were totally excluded from political affairs. Led by [[Kate Sheppard]], a women's suffrage movement began in New Zealand in the late 19th century, and the legislative council finally passed a bill allowing women to vote in 1893.<ref name="The right to vote">[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/womens-suffrage/brief-history The right to vote], New Zealand History Online</ref> This made New Zealand the first country in the world to give women the vote. However, they were not allowed to stand as candidates until 1919, and the first female Member of Parliament ([[Elizabeth McCombs]]) was not elected until 1933<ref name="The right to vote"/> – 40 years later. Although there have been three female Prime Ministers ([[Jenny Shipley]], [[Helen Clark]] and [[Jacinda Ardern]]), women remain somewhat under-represented in Parliament.<ref name="The right to vote"/> Following the [[2011 New Zealand general election|election in 2011]], 39 MPs (almost one third) were women. After the 2011 election, on a global ranking New Zealand is 21st in terms of its representation of women in Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/ParlSupport/ResearchPapers/d/c/3/00PlibCIP191-The-2011-General-Election.htm |title=The 2011 General Election |access-date=22 February 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121220012740/http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/ParlSupport/ResearchPapers/d/c/3/00PlibCIP191-The-2011-General-Election.htm |archive-date=20 December 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

=== Prisoners' right to vote ===
{{Further|Voting rights of prisoners in New Zealand}}
Restrictions have also been imposed on prisoners. In 2010, the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|National government]] passed The Electoral (Disqualification of Convicted Prisoners) Amendment Bill which removed the right of all sentenced prisoners to vote. The Attorney General said the new law was inconsistent with the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights Act]] which says that "every New Zealand citizen who is over the age of 18 years has the right to vote and stand in genuine periodic elections of members of the House of Representatives".<ref name="Prisoners and the Right to Vote">[http://nzccl.org.nz/content/prisoners-and-right-vote Prisoners and the Right to Vote], NZ Council for Civil Liberties</ref> Prior to the 2010 Act, only prisoners with a sentence of three years or more were not allowed to vote – which is also inconsistent with the Bill of Rights Act. The Electoral Disqualification Bill was also opposed by the Law Society and the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]] who pointed out that, in addition to being inconsistent with the Bill of Rights, the legislation was also incompatible with various international treaties that New Zealand is party to.

Law Society Human Rights committee member, Jonathan Temm, in a written submission, told Parliament's law and order committee that: "It is critical for the function of our democracy that we do not interfere with the right to vote." With specific reference to decisions made by courts in Canada, Australia and South Africa, and by the European Court of Human Rights in respect of the United Kingdom, she pointed out that "every comparable overseas jurisdiction has had a blanket ban (against prisoners' voting) struck down in the last 10 years".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url= https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en-NZ/49SCLO_EVI_00DBHOH_BILL9745_1_A52202/a2eaf7806dbc84177f617a496d3ff9914d2834e9|title=New Zealand Law Society's submission to the Select Committee for Law and Order regarding the Electoral (Disqualification of Convicted Prisoners) Amendment Bill 2010|last=Temm|first=Jonathan|date=8 June 1010|website=www.parliament.govt.nz|access-date=27 May 2018}}</ref>

==Election day==
Until the {{NZ election link|1938}}, elections were held on a weekday. In 1938 and in {{NZ election link year|1943}}, elections were held on a Saturday. In {{NZ election link year|1946}} and {{NZ election link year|1949}}, elections were held on a Wednesday.<ref>{{cite web |title=Under the Influence |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/election-day-through-years/under-influence |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate=9 August 2013 |date=15 February 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140904163037/http://www.elections.org.nz/election-day-through-years/under-influence |archive-date=4 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1950, the legal requirement to hold elections on a Saturday was introduced,<ref name="Key dates in electoral reform">{{cite web |title=Key dates in New Zealand electoral reform |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/voting-system/history-vote/electoral-timeline |publisher=Elections New Zealand |accessdate=9 August 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130914170302/http://www.elections.org.nz/voting-system/history-vote/electoral-timeline |archive-date=14 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and this first applied to the {{NZ election link|1951}}. Beginning with the {{NZ election link|1957}}, a convention was formed to hold general elections on the last Saturday of November. This convention was upset by [[Robert Muldoon]] calling a snap election, which was held on Saturday 14 July {{NZ election link year|1984}}. The next year an election could have been held on the last Saturday of November would have been 1996, except the day for that election was brought forward slightly to avoid the need for a by-election after [[Hawkes Bay (New Zealand electorate)|Hawkes' Bay]] MP [[Michael Laws]] resigned in April that year (by-elections are not required if a general election is to take place within six months of the vacancy). Since then, only the {{NZ election link|1999}} and {{NZ election link|2011}} have been held on the traditional day.

In the twenty-first century, a new convention seems to have arisen: since the {{NZ election link|2005}}, all elections except two have been held on the second-last Saturday of September. The exceptions were in 2011, which was held in November to avoid clashing with fixtures of the New Zealand-hosted [[2011 Rugby World Cup|Rugby World Cup]], and in 2020, which was delayed from the second-last Saturday of September due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand|COVID-19 pandemic]].

Prior to 1951, elections in [[Māori electorates]] were held on different days than elections in general electorates.<ref name="Key dates in electoral reform" /> The table below shows election dates starting with the first election that was held on a Saturday in 1938:<ref name="General elections 1853–2005">{{cite web |title=General elections 1853–2005 – dates & turnout |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/events/past-events-0/general-elections-1853-2011-dates-and-turnout |archive-url= https://archive.today/20130809195933/http://www.elections.org.nz/events/past-events-0/general-elections-1853-2011-dates-and-turnout |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 August 2013 |publisher=Elections New Zealand |accessdate=9 August 2013 }}</ref>

== MMP in New Zealand ==<!-- redir from MMP in New Zealand lands here-->
[[File:New Zealand MMP voting paper.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A sample MMP ballot paper]]
{{Update-section|date=October 2020}}
Until 1994, New Zealand used the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] (FPP) electoral system, whereby the candidate who received the
most votes in each single-member constituency was elected from that constituency. This system favoured the [[two-party system|two-party dominance]] of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] and the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]. Smaller parties found it hard to gain representation; for example, despite gaining 16% of the vote in 1978 and 21% in 1981, the [[Social Credit Party (New Zealand)|New Zealand Social Credit Party]] won only one and two seats, respectively.

Spurred by public disillusionment in the political system, Labour campaigned in 1981 and 1984 on a promise to establish a Royal Commission into the electoral system. Following their election into government in 1984, Labour established the Royal Commission into the Electoral System, and the commission's 1986 report recommended the adoption of [[mixed-member proportional representation]] (MMP). After the government sidelining the issue for years, the [[Jim Bolger|Bolger]] National government responded to public pressure by holding an [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|indicative referendum]] on the electoral system in 1992. After an overwhelming majority for change, a second, [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|binding referendum]] was held in 1993 asking voters to choose between FPP and MMP.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/fpp-to-mmp|title=The road to MMP – The road to MMP – NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=Nzhistory.govt.nz|accessdate=26 May 2018}}</ref>

In 1994, New Zealand officially adopted MMP as its electoral system. Its defining characteristic is a mix of members of Parliament (MPs) from single-seat electorates and MPs elected from a party list, with each party's share of seats determined by its share of the party vote nationwide.<ref>Electoral Commission [http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/all/themes/referendum/resources/ProposalsPaper/MMP%20Proposal%20Paper.pdf Proposals Paper] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120901022210/http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/all/themes/referendum/resources/ProposalsPaper/MMP%20Proposal%20Paper.pdf |date=1 September 2012 }} 13 August 2012, p 3.</ref> The first MMP election was held in 1996. As a result, National and Labour lost their complete dominance in the House. Neither party would have a majority of seats until the {{NZ election link|2020}}, with Labour winning 64 seats, giving a majority of 3 (61 seats to hold a majority). Previously in the [[2014 New Zealand General Election|2014 election]] the Nationals won 60 seats, 1 short of a majority.

Under MMP, New Zealand voters have two votes. The first vote is the ''electorate vote''. It determines the local representative for that [[New Zealand electorates|electorate]] (geographic [[electoral district]]). The electorate vote works on a plurality system whereby whichever candidate gets the greatest number of votes in each electorate wins the seat. The second vote is the ''party vote''. This determines the number of seats each party is entitled to overall – in other words, the proportionality of the House.

'''Thresholds:''' There are two thresholds in the New Zealand MMP system.<ref name="Proposals Paper">Electoral Commission [http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/all/themes/referendum/resources/ProposalsPaper/MMP%20Proposal%20Paper.pdf Proposals Paper] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120901022210/http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/all/themes/referendum/resources/ProposalsPaper/MMP%20Proposal%20Paper.pdf |date=1 September 2012 }} 13 August 2012, p 9.</ref> The first is that any Party which receives 5% or more of the Party vote is entitled to a share of the nominally 120 seats in the House of Representatives – even if the Party does not win a single electorate seat.<ref name="Sainte-Laguë">{{cite web|title=Sainte-Laguë allocation formula|url= http://www.elections.org.nz/voting-system/mmp-voting-system/sainte-lague-allocation-formula|publisher=Electoral Commission|accessdate=4 August 2017|language=en}}</ref> For instance in the 2008 elections, the Greens failed to win any electorate seats but won 6.7% of the party vote and thereby earned nine seats in Parliament.<ref name="Proposals Paper"/>

The second threshold is that any Party that wins one or more electorate seats is entitled to an additional share of the nominally 120 seats in House of Representatives based on the percentage of the party vote – even if it doesn't win 5% of the vote.<ref name="Sainte-Laguë"/> In 2008, the ACT Party won only 3.6% of the Party vote. But ACT got a total of five seats in the House of Representatives because an ACT candidate won the Epsom electorate; this has been called the "coat-tailing" rule.<ref name="Proposals Paper"/> However, the [[New Zealand First]] party which got 4.07% of the list vote or below the 5% threshold was not returned to parliament in 2008.

Seats in parliament are allocated to electorate MPs first. Then Parties fulfil their remaining quota (based on their share of the Party vote) from their list members. A [[closed list]] is used, and list seats are allocated by the [[Sainte-Laguë method]],<ref name="Sainte-Laguë"/> which favours minor parties more than the alternative [[D'Hondt method]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Divisor Method Proportional Representation in Preference-Ballot Elections|url= http://www.votingmatters.org.uk/ISSUE28/I28P2.pdf|publisher=Voting matters|accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref> If a Party has more electorate MPs than proportional seats, then it receives an [[Overhang seat|overhang]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Overhang|url= http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/Overhang.pdf |publisher=Electoral Commission|accessdate=4 August 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170502204252/http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/Overhang.pdf|archive-date=2 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> This first occurred following the 2005 General Election when the Māori party won 4 electorates despite its overall party vote (2.1%) only entitling it to 3 seats, thus it received one overhang seat and the 48th Parliament subsequently consisted of 121 MPs. The 2008 and 2011 elections also saw the Māori Party receive overhang seats (2 and 1 respectively), whilst the 2014 election saw United Future receive their one and only seat in the House as a result of an overhang.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/Overhang.pdf |title=Overhang|last=|first=|date=|website=MMP Review|accessdate=17 May 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180130024953/http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/Overhang.pdf |archive-date=30 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Only parties registered with the Electoral Commission can submit party lists; unregistered parties can contest elections but cannot provide party lists. Not all registered parties submit a party list. Reasons for this may vary and include missing the deadline. The following registered parties did not submit party lists:

The 2014 case of the [[Internet Party (New Zealand)|Internet Party]] and the [[Mana Movement]] not submitting lists was due to their forming an electoral alliance called [[Internet Party and Mana Movement|Internet MANA]]. This alliance had to be registered as a separate party, but the individual component parties were not deregistered, and are thus listed as not having submitted a list. Internet Mana was deregistered in December 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amendments to the Register of Political Parties |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/amendments-register-political-parties |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=2 April 2017 |date=19 December 2014}}</ref>

=== Strategic voting ===
The two largest parties [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] usually "top up" their electoral candidates with list candidates, so that supporting a candidate of a minor party allied with their party will not reduce the number of seats that the major party wins, but supporting the minor party will increase the number of MPs who support their party in coalition. This is called "[[strategic voting]]" or sometimes "tactical voting".

In [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999]] when [[Jeanette Fitzsimons]] contested the (usually [[New Zealand National Party|National]]) seat of [[Coromandel (New Zealand electorate)|Coromandel]] for the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]], it seemed that the Greens' chances of entering parliament were dependent on Fitzsimons' performance in Coromandel; in order to receive [[proportional representation]], the party needed to either gain five percent of the national vote or win an electorate seat, and it appeared that the former option was unlikely. Labour Leader (and Prime Minister after the election) [[Helen Clark]] openly encouraged Labour supporters to give their constituency vote to Fitzsimons and their party vote to Labour.<ref>{{cite book|title=Left Turn: The New Zealand General Election of 1999|page=237|publisher=Victoria University Press|date=2000|isbn=9780864734044}}</ref> When normal votes had been counted, it appeared that Fitzsimons had been defeated in Coromandel by [[New Zealand National Party|National]]'s [[Murray McLean]], but when special votes were tallied, Fitzsimons had a narrow lead. This guaranteed the Green Party seats in parliament regardless of whether it crossed the five percent threshold (as it eventually did).

In several recent elections in New Zealand [[New Zealand National Party|National]] has suggested that National supporters in certain electorates should vote for minor parties or candidates who can win an electorate seat and would support a National government. This culminated in the [[Tea tape scandal]] when a meeting in the [[Epsom (NZ electorate)|Epsom electorate]] in [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011]] was taped. The meeting was to encourage National voters in the electorate to vote "strategically" for the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] candidate. [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] could have suggested to its supporters in the electorate to vote "strategically" for the National candidate, as the Labour candidate could not win the seat but a National win in the seat would deprive National of an ally. However, Labour chose not to engage in this tactic instead calling it a "sweetheart deal".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.newshub.co.nz/opinion/opinion-labour-hypocrisy-over-mount-roskill-dirty-deal-2016083011 |title= Labour hypocrisy over Mount-Roskill dirty deal |website=Newshub.co.nz|accessdate=26 May 2018}}</ref>

From 2008 onwards [[United Future]] also benefited from the strategic vote. Party leader [[Peter Dunne]] was re-elected into the [[Ōhāriu (New Zealand electorate)|Ōhariū]] seat in [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]], [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011]], and [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014]], becoming a coalition partner with National, despite receiving under 1% of the party vote. In 2017 National stood candidate [[Brett Hudson (politician)|Brett Hundson]] in the electorate, but National leader [[Bill English]] vocally advocated strategic voting, saying: ”We are encouraging National supporters to give their electorate vote to ACT candidate, David Seymour, in Epsom, and United Future candidate, Peter Dunne, in Ōhariu – and their party vote to National.”<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/95119031/bill-english-calls-for-tactical-voting-in-epsom-ohariu-to-elect-support-party-leaders|title=Bill English calls for tactical voting in Epsom, Ohariu to elect support party leaders|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=26 May 2018}}</ref> In 2017 the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] did not stand a candidate in Ōhariū in order to strengthen Labour candidate [[Greg O'Connor (politician)|Greg O’Connors]] chance at beating Dunne.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/324462/green-party-will-not-stand-in-ohariu |title=Green Party will not stand in Ōhāriu|date=14 February 2017|website=Radionz.co.nz|accessdate=26 May 2018}}</ref> When Dunne resigned from politics just a month out from the election after low polling results, the Green Party decided to stand Tane Woodley in the electorate.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/96080647/all-bets-off-in-ohariu-as-green-party-stand-11thhour-candidate-in-political-hotseat |title=All bets off in Ohariu as Green Party stand 11th-hour candidate in political hotseat|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=26 May 2018}}</ref>

=== 2011 referendum and Electoral Commission 2012 report ===
A [[2011 New Zealand voting system referendum|referendum on the voting system]] was held in conjunction with the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]], with 57.8% of voters voting to keep the existing Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) voting system. The majority vote automatically triggered under the Electoral Referendum Act 2010 an independent review of the workings of the system by the Electoral Commission.

The Commission released a consultation paper in February 2012 calling for public submissions on ways to improve the MMP system, with the focus put on six areas: basis of eligibility for list seats (thresholds), by-election candidates, dual candidacy, order of candidates on party lists, overhang, and proportion of electorate seats to list seats. The Commission released its proposal paper for consultation in August 2012, before publishing its final report on 29 October 2012. In the report, the Commission recommended the following:<ref name="MMPproposal">{{cite web |url= http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/default/files/pages/uploads/Final%20report%202012%20review%20of%20MMP.pdf |title= Report of the Electoral Commission on the review of the MMP voting system |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 29 October 2012 |accessdate= 7 December 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121114205922/http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/default/files/pages/uploads/Final%20Report%202012%20Review%20of%20MMP.pdf |archive-date= 14 November 2012 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

* Reducing the party vote threshold from 5 percent to 4 percent. If the 4 percent threshold is introduced, it should be reviewed after three general elections.
* Abolishing the one electorate seat threshold – a party must cross the party vote threshold to gain list seats.
* Abolishing the provision of overhang seats for parties not reaching the threshold – the extra electorates would be made up at the expense of list seats to retain 120 MPs
* Retaining the status quo for by-election candidacy and dual candidacy.
* Retaining the status quo with closed party lists, but increasing scrutiny in selection of list candidates to ensure parties comply with their own party rules.
* Parliament should give consideration to fixing the ratio between electorate seats and list seats at 60:40 (72:48 in a 120-seat parliament)

Parliament is responsible for implementing any changes to the system, which has been largely unchanged since it was introduced in 1994 for the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]]. In November 2012 a [[private member's bill]] under the name of opposition Labour Party member [[Iain Lees-Galloway]] was put forward to implement the first two recommendations, although the bill would have to be chosen in the member's bill ballot.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/ProposedBills/5/2/c/50HOH_MEMBILL158_1-Electoral-Adjustment-of-Thresholds-Amendment-Bill.htm |title= Electoral (Adjustment of Thresholds) Amendment Bill – Proposed members' bills |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |date= 20 November 2012 |accessdate= 7 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9400901/Electoral-threshold-bill-drawn |title= Electoral threshold bill drawn |publisher=Stuff/Fairfax |date=14 November 2013}}</ref>

In May 2014 [[Judith Collins]] and [[John Key]] said that there was no inter-party consensus on implementing the results of the Commission, so would not introduce any legislation.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10883610 |title=Government rejects recommendations to change MMP system| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| date=14 May 2014}}</ref>

== Electoral boundaries ==
The number of electorate MPs is calculated in three steps. The less populated of New Zealand's two principal islands, the [[South Island]], has a fixed quota of 16 seats. The number of seats for the [[North Island]] and the number of special reserved seats for Māori are then calculated in proportion to these. (The [[Māori electorates]] have their own special electoral roll; people of Māori descent may opt to enroll either on this roll or on the general roll, and the number of Māori seats is determined with reference to the number of adult Māori who opt for the Māori roll.)

The number of electorates is recalculated, and the boundaries of each redrawn so as to make them approximately equal in population within a tolerance of plus or minus 5%, after each [[quinquennial]] (five-year) census. After the 2001 census, there were 7 Māori electorates and 62 general electorates, or 69 electorates in total. There were therefore normally 51 list MPs. By a quirk of timing, the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 election]] was the first election since [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996]] at which the electorates were not redrawn since the previous election. A census was held on 7 March 2006 and new electorate boundaries released on 25 September 2007, creating an additional electorate in the North Island.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10465936">{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=144&objectid=10465936 |title=Central North Island marginal |author=Trevett, Claire |date=26 September 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref> For the [[2011 New Zealand general election|election in 2011]] there were 63 general electorates, 7 Māori electorates and 50 list seats, plus one ''overhang'' seat. For the [[2014 New Zealand general election|election in 2014]] there were 64 general electorates, 7 Māori electorates and 49 list seats, plus one ''overhang'' seat (the population increase resulted in an additional general electorate and hence a reduction in list electorates).

== Representation statistics ==

The [[Gallagher Index]] is a measurement of how closely the proportions of votes cast for each party is reflected in the number of parliamentary seats gained by that party. The resultant disproportionality figure is a percentage – the lower the index, the better the match.<ref>Stephen Levine and Nigel S.
