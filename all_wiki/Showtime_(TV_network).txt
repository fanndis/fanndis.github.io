'''Showtime''' is an [[United States|American]] [[pay television|premium television]] [[television network|network]] that is owned by [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]], and is the flagship property of parent subsidiary under its Premium Content Group unit, [[Showtime Networks]]. Showtime's programming primarily includes [[Art release#Film|theatrically released]] [[Feature film|motion pictures]] and [[Original series|original]] [[television program|television series]], along with [[boxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]] matches, occasional [[stand-up comedy]] [[television special|specials]], and [[Television film|made-for-TV movies]].

Headquartered at [[Paramount Plaza]] on the northern end of [[New York City]]'s [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] district, Showtime operates eight 24-hour, linear [[Multiplex (television)|multiplex channels]]; a traditional subscription [[video on demand]] service; and two proprietary [[streaming media|streaming]] platforms, the [[TV Everywhere]] offering Showtime Anytime (which is included as part of a subscription to the linear Showtime television service) and a namesake [[over-the-top media services|over-the-top service]] sold directly to streaming-only consumers. In addition, the Showtime [[brand]] has been licensed for use by a number of channels and platforms worldwide, including [[Showtime Arabia]] (since merged into [[OSN]]) in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], and the now-defunct [[Showtime Movie Channels]] in [[Australia]].

Showtime is also sold independently of traditional and [[over-the-top content|over-the-top]] [[multichannel video programming distributor]]s [[a la carte pay television|a la carte]] through [[Apple TV (software)|Apple TV Channels]] and [[Prime Video|Amazon Video Channels]], which feature  VOD library content and live feeds of Showtime's linear television services (consisting of the primary channel's [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] feeds and, for Amazon Video customers, the East Coast feeds of its seven multiplex channels).<ref>{{cite news|title=Apple unveils streaming TV services|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/apple-tv-channels-streaming-tv-service-announced.html|author=Todd Haselton|website=[[CNBC]]|publisher=[[NBCUniversal Television Group#NBCUniversal News Group|NBCUniversal News Group]]|date=March 25, 2019|accessdate=March 25, 2019|archive-date=March 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325201440/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/apple-tv-channels-streaming-tv-service-announced.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon Prime Video Channels: Everything you need to know|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-prime-video-channels-everything-you-need-to-know/|author=David Katzmaier|website=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=May 23, 2019|accessdate=June 9, 2020|archive-date=June 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200610035913/https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-prime-video-channels-everything-you-need-to-know/|url-status=live}}</ref> {{As of|September 2018}}, Showtime's programming was available to approximately 28.567 million U.S. households that subscribed to a multichannel television provider (28.318 million of which receive Showtime's primary channel at minimum).<ref>{{cite web|title=Nielsen coverage estimates for September see gains at ESPN networks, NBCSN, and NBA TV, drops at MLBN and NFLN (Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: September 2018)|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn-nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html|author=Andrew Bucholtz|website=Awful Announcing|publisher=[[NESN|NESN Digital]]|date=September 10, 2018|accessdate=September 20, 2018|archive-date=September 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918124511/http://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn-nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Early history (1976–1982)===
Showtime was launched on July 1, 1976 on Times-Mirror Cable systems in [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Palos Verdes, California|Palos Verdes]], [[California]] through the conversion of 10,000 subscribers of the previous Channel One franchise.

By the end of its first year on the air, Showtime had a total of 55,000 subscribers nationwide.<ref name="King of Pay-TV"/> On March 7, 1978, Showtime became a ''nationally'' distributed service after it was uplinked to [[communications satellite|satellite]], turning it into a competitor with [[HBO]] and other pay cable networks.<ref name="Showtime 25">{{cite web|title=25 memorable moments in Showtime's 25-year history|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117801025.html?categoryid=1013&cs=1|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=June 7, 2001|access-date=April 17, 2020|archive-date=June 16, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616162306/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117801025.html?categoryid=1013&cs=1|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1979, Viacom sold a 50% ownership interest in Showtime to the [[TelePrompTer Corporation]].<ref name="King of Pay-TV"/> On July 4, 1981, Showtime adopted a 24-hour programming schedule (rival HBO would eventually follow suit in December of that year).<ref name="Movie Duels">{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: The Movie Duels|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-the-movie-duels/|author=Bill Mesce|work=Sound on Sight|date=September 2, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014|archive-date=February 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202101645/http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-the-movie-duels/|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1982, [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] Cable, a subsidiary of [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] (which had acquired TelePrompTer the previous year), sold its 50% stake in Showtime back to Viacom for $75 million;<ref name="King of Pay-TV"/> the sale of Group W's stake in the channel occurred as the company had entered into a partnership with Walt Disney Productions (now [[The Walt Disney Company]]) to develop a competing premium service, [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] (Group W dropped out of the [[joint venture]] that September, due to disagreements over creative control and financial obligations{{sfn|Grover|1991|p=147}}). 1982 saw the premiere of Showtime's first [[television film|made-for-cable movie]] ''Falcon's Gold'' and its first original series and children's program ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]''.

===Formation of Showtime Networks and ownership by Viacom (1982–2005)===
In August 1982, [[MCA Inc.]] (then-owner of [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]), [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]] (then-owner of [[Paramount Pictures]]) and Warner Communications reached an agreement to jointly acquire [[The Movie Channel]] (TMC), in which the three companies combined would acquire a controlling 75% interest in the service (with each holding a 25% ownership stake) from Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|title=3 TOP MOVIE STUDIOS ARE EXPECTED TO JOIN PAY-TV FILM PROJECT|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/08/nyregion/3-top-movie-studios-are-expected-to-join-pay-tv-film-project.html|author=Tony Schawrtz|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=August 8, 1982|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215135047/http://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/08/nyregion/3-top-movie-studios-are-expected-to-join-pay-tv-film-project.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The proposal was motivated by the studios wanting to increase their share of revenue for licensing rights to their films to premium television services, as well as concerns that HBO's dominance of that market and its pre-buying of pay cable rights to films prior to their theatrical release would result in that service holding undue negotiating power for the television rights, resulting in a lower than suitable licensing fee rate the studios would be paid for individual films. The three companies officially announced their agreement in principle to acquire interests in TMC on November 11, 1982.<ref>{{cite news|title=3 STUDIOS TO BUY SHARES IN A PAY-TV NETWORK|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/12/business/3-studios-to-buy-shares-in-a-pay-tv-network.html|author=Tony Schwartz|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 12, 1982|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215124914/http://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/12/business/3-studios-to-buy-shares-in-a-pay-tv-network.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="JV">{{cite book|title=Joint Ventures, Alliances, and Corporate Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeY_afXHSnEC&pg=PA167|author=Kathryn Rudie Harrigan|publisher=Beard Books|page=167|date=January 1, 1985|isbn = 9781587981951|accessdate=April 20, 2015|archive-date=October 31, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031183240/https://books.google.com/books?id=JeY_afXHSnEC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="HITIA">{{cite book|title=Hollywood in the Information Age: Beyond the Silver Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuuuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA78|author=Janet Wasko|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|page=167|date=June 26, 2013|isbn = 9780745678337|accessdate=April 20, 2015|archive-date=October 31, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031175037/https://books.google.com/books?id=KuuuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref> Subsequently, in late December of that year, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] (which had blocked a similar attempt by MCA, Gulf+Western, [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Columbia Pictures]] to create a competing pay service, Premiere, in an [[antitrust]] case ruling two years earlier in January 1981) launched a routine preliminary inquiry into the proposed partnership.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Justice Department's anti-trust division has launched a routine...|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/05/The-Justice-Departments-anti-trust-division-has-launched-a-routine/5608410590800/|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=January 5, 1983|access-date=May 6, 2016|archive-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215153442/http://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/05/The-Justice-Departments-anti-trust-division-has-launched-a-routine/5608410590800/|url-status=live}}</ref>

On January 7, 1983, Viacom International added itself as a partner and drafted an amendment to the proposal to consolidate The Movie Channel with Showtime. Under the revised proposal, the four studios would each own a 22.58% stake in the two networks, with American Express owning a 9.68% minority interest. In addition, the consortium would appoint a management team separate from those employed by the two channels – which would continue to operate as separate services – to operate the joint venture. However, the deal ran into regulatory hurdles since Warner, Universal and Paramount received 50% of their respective total revenue from film releases and licensing fees from premium services; furthermore, Showtime and TMC combined would control about 30% of the pay cable marketplace, creating an [[oligopoly]] with HBO (which, in conjunction with Cinemax, controlled 60% of the market).<ref name="JV"/><ref name="HITIA"/><ref>{{cite news|title=5 COMPANIES IN VENTURE TO RUN 2 PAY-TV UNITS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/08/business/5-companies-in-venture-to-run-2-pay-tv-units.html|author=Sally Bedell|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 8, 1983|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215135053/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/08/business/5-companies-in-venture-to-run-2-pay-tv-units.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

After a four-month investigation resulted in the Department of Justice filing a civil antitrust lawsuit against the five parties to block the Showtime-TMC merger on June 10, 1983, the Department asked Warner and American Express to restructure the deal during hearings for the case.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. WILL FIGHT PAY-TV MERGER BY FILM STUDIOS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/11/business/us-will-fight-pay-tv-merger-by-film-studios.html|author=Sally Bedell Smith|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=June 11, 1983|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215125325/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/11/business/us-will-fight-pay-tv-merger-by-film-studios.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The Department's decision – citing concerns, including some expressed by HBO management, that combining the assets of Showtime and TMC would stifle competition in the sale of their programming and that of other pay cable services to cable providers – was despite the fact that, under the original proposal, MCA, Gulf+Western and Warner had each agreed to continue licensing films released by their respective movie studios to competing pay television networks.<ref name="JV"/><ref name="HITIA"/> The partners involved in the merger would also set standard prices for films that were acquired for broadcast on The Movie Channel and Showtime, either those produced by the studio partners or by unassociated film studios. To address the Justice Department's concerns over the deal, the four partners submitted another revised proposal for consideration on July 19, that included guarantees of conduct agreeing that Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros. would not receive higher residual licensing payments for films acquired by Showtime and The Movie Channel than that paid by other studios, and that all four partners would not permit the two channels in the venture to pay lower fees for films produced by three studio partners than that paid by smaller pay television services for the same films.<ref>{{cite news|title=PAY-TV MERGER RULING SEEN|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/20/business/pay-tv-merger-ruling-seen.html|author=Sally Bedell Smith|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 20, 1983|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215125046/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/20/business/pay-tv-merger-ruling-seen.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the revised proposal was rejected on July 28, Warner Communications and American Express restructured the purchase to include only Viacom as a partner, bowing Gulf+Western and MCA out from the partnership. The changes – which Justice Department officials acknowledged would "prevent any anti-competitive effect from arising" following the merger, by allowing other premium services to enter the market should the venture significantly raise licensing fee prices for films – led the Justice Department to drop its challenge to the merger agreement on August 12; the Department formally approved the deal the following day on August 13.<ref name="JV"/><ref name="HITIA"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Way cleared for Movie Channel-Showtime merger|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/08/12/Way-cleared-for-Movie-Channel-Showtime-merger/1474429508800/|author=Barbara Rosewicz|agency=United Press International|date=August 12, 1983|access-date=May 6, 2016|archive-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215185658/http://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/08/12/Way-cleared-for-Movie-Channel-Showtime-merger/1474429508800/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=PAY-TV LINK ACCEPTED BY U.S. AFTER CHANGES|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/13/business/pay-tv-link-accepted-by-us-after-changes.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=August 13, 1983|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215143642/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/13/business/pay-tv-link-accepted-by-us-after-changes.html|url-status=live}}</ref> When the deal was completed on September 6, 1983, the operations of The Movie Channel and Showtime were folded into a new [[holding company]], Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc., which was majority owned by Viacom (controlling 50% of the venture's common stock as well as investing $40 million in cash), with Warner Communications (which owned 31%) and Warner-Amex (which owned the remaining 19% interest) as minority partners.<ref>{{cite news|title=Showtime and the Movie Channel have formed a pay-TV...|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/07/Showtime-and-the-Movie-Channel-have-formed-a-pay-TV/5279431755200/|agency=United Press International|date=September 7, 1983|access-date=May 6, 2016|archive-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215133423/http://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/07/Showtime-and-the-Movie-Channel-have-formed-a-pay-TV/5279431755200/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=2 PAY-TV SERVICES MERGE|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/07/business/2-pay-tv-services-merge.html|author=Sandra Salmans|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=September 7, 1983|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215135043/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/07/business/2-pay-tv-services-merge.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

As the consolidation of its operations with The Movie Channel was ongoing, in 1983, Showtime increased its national distribution on cable providers when competing premium service [[Spotlight (TV channel)|Spotlight]] ceased operations, effectively absorbing that channel's subscriber base.<ref name="King of Pay-TV"/>

1984 saw the network's first major promotional campaign, "We Make Excitement" (also referred to, particularly in bumpers and program introductions, as "Showtime Excitement"), created by the J. Walter Thompson company and utilizing an adapted version of the [[The Pointer Sisters|Pointer Sisters]] song "[[I'm So Excited]]". The campaign lasted into 1986 and coincided with both the exclusivity deal signed with Paramount for films (see below) and a graphical upgrade to the network's presentation to include computer-generated graphics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/01/business/advertising-showtime-gets-new-campaign.html|title=Advertising; Showtime Gets New Campaign|last=Dougherty|first=Philip H.|date=1984-06-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=2019-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712005150/https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/01/business/advertising-showtime-gets-new-campaign.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

On August 10, 1985, after [[Time Inc.]] and cable provider [[Tele-Communications Inc.]] (TCI) jointly submitted a bid to buy the company for $900 million and the assumption of $500 million in debt as well as an earlier offer by American Express the previous month to buy out Warner's share of the company (under a clause in the agreement that allowed either company the option of buying out their partner's stake in Warner-Amex), Warner Communications exercised an option to acquire American Express' 50% share of Warner-Amex Cable Communications for $450 million. Among the options, barring that it chose to sell Viacom a 50% interest in the company for $450 million, the deal originally excluded Warner-Amex's 19% interest in Showtime-The Movie Channel, Inc.; that interest would have reverted to Warner, which intended to operate Warner-Amex as a wholly owned subsidiary.<ref>{{cite news|title=WARNER TO BUY OUT AMEX UNIT|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/10/business/warner-to-buy-out-amex-unit.html|author=Geraldine Fabrikant|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=August 10, 1985|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215125212/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/10/business/warner-to-buy-out-amex-unit.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Warner Buys All Stock in Warner Amex|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/08/10/warner-buys-all-stock-in-warner-amex/bc9e3fab-2a0e-40ab-b311-868eab50eedc/|author=Nell Henderson|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Media Group|The Washington Post Company]]|date=August 10, 1985|access-date=May 6, 2016|archive-date=June 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609193358/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/08/10/warner-buys-all-stock-in-warner-amex/bc9e3fab-2a0e-40ab-b311-868eab50eedc/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Warner Agrees To Buy Out Partner In Cable Television|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-08-10/business/8502220292_1_warner-amex-cable-communications-geoffrey-holmes-warner-board|author=Charles Storch|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=August 10, 1985|access-date=2016-05-06|archive-date=2017-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215143453/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-08-10/business/8502220292_1_warner-amex-cable-communications-geoffrey-holmes-warner-board|url-status=live}}</ref>

Two weeks later on August 26, Viacom acquired Warner Communications and Warner-Amex's combined 50% ownership interest in Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc. as well as full ownership of the Warner-Amex and public shareholder interests in [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] for $671.7 million, giving Viacom exclusive ownership of both networks and once again making it the sole owner of Showtime through its $500 million cash payment and acquisition of 1.625 million shares from Warner for the latter's 31% stake in Showtime/The Movie Channel and Warner-Amex's 19% interest in the unit and its 60% interest in MTV Networks (Viacom owned Showtime alone or jointly with other companies – [[TelePrompTer Corporation]], and later briefly, its successor Group W Cable – from the time it launched in July 1976). The buyout, part of an option given by Warner in its purchase of American Express' interest in MTV, was exercised in part to finance much of the buyout of Showtime/The Movie Channel without borrowing any money (ironically, Warner Communications would eventually acquire rivals HBO and [[Cinemax]], when the company merged with [[Time Inc.]] in 1989 to form [[Time Warner]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Viacom to acquire Showtime and MTV|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/08/26/Viacom-to-acquire-Showtime-and-MTV/4842493876800/|agency=United Press International|date=August 26, 1985|access-date=May 6, 2016|archive-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215185654/http://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/08/26/Viacom-to-acquire-Showtime-and-MTV/4842493876800/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Viacom to Buy MTV and Showtime in Deal Worth $667.5 Million|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-27/business/fi-25404_1_viacom-deal|author=Michael A.

Also in 1988, the company formed Showtime Event Television (now Showtime PPV) as a [[pay-per-view]] distributor of special event programming. In 1990, Showtime ventured into acquiring and premiering [[independent film]]s exclusively for the channel as part of the ''30-Minute Movie'' [[short film]] [[anthology series]]. One of its first premieres, ''[[12:01 PM]]'', was nominated for an [[Academy Award]], while 1992's ''[[Session Man (film)|Session Man]]'' won an [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]].<ref name="Showtime 25"/> In the years that followed, Showtime expanded its acquisitions into the realm of feature-length fare, including the [[Adrian Lyne]]-directed 1997 remake of ''[[Lolita (1997 film)|Lolita]]''.

On March 1, 1994, Showtime and The Movie Channel in conjunction with rivals HBO and Cinemax implemented a cooperative [[United States pay television content advisory system|content advisory system]] to provide to parents specific information about pay-cable programming content that may be unsuitable for their children; the development of the system—inspired by the advisory ratings featured in program guides distributed by the major premium cable services—was in response to concerns from parents and advocacy groups about violent content on television, allowing Showtime Networks and other premium services discretionary authority to assign individual ratings corresponding to the objectionable content depicted in specific programs (and categorized based on violence, profanity, sexuality or miscellaneous mature material).<ref>{{cite web|title=Cable Leaders to Develop Violence Ratings|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-870441.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611020259/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-870441.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|author=Ellen Edwards|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Media Group|The Washington Post Company]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=January 11, 1994|accessdate=March 11, 2013|url-access=subscription}}</ref> A revised system—centered around ten content codes of two to three letters in length—was implemented by Showtime and the other participating premium services on June 10, 1994.<ref>{{cite news|title=Premium Cable Channels Adopt Content Labels|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-06-08/entertainment/ca-1867_1_cable-channels/|author=Steve Weinstein|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Times Mirror Company]]|date=June 8, 1994|access-date=2020-09-29|archive-date=2010-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709072622/http://articles.latimes.com/1994-06-08/entertainment/ca-1867_1_cable-channels|url-status=live}}</ref>

1997 saw the channel's first major rebrand since the 1980s, with a new logo emphasizing the "SHO" part of the network's name within a circle (intended to be a spotlight), playing into the channel's common acronym in listings services like ''[[TV Guide]]''. A new slogan, "No Limits" (in reference to the fact that as a premium channel, Showtime could push the boundaries of programming without censorship, as well as offer the type of exciting programming that appealed to subscribers), and a bold red-and-black color scheme was instituted, with promotions and bumpers feature surrealistic imagery; the campaign was created by the newly formed in-house marketing and advertising agency, "Red Group".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/10/business/media-business-advertising-for-new-campaign-showtime-networks-planning-open.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; For a new campaign, Showtime Networks is planning to open an in-house agency.|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|date=1997-12-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=2019-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191205222556/https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/10/business/media-business-advertising-for-new-campaign-showtime-networks-planning-open.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The following year in 2001, Showtime became one of the first cable networks to launch a [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed (with ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'' becoming the first film on the network to be broadcast in HD); Showtime also began to provide [[Dolby Digital|Dolby Digital 5.1]] [[surround sound]] on select programs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Showtime Networks Enhances Viewing Experience With Dolby Digital 5.1|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Showtime+Networks+Enhances+Viewing+Experience+With+Dolby+Digital+5.1.-a058659460|agency=[[Business Wire]]|via=The Free Library|date=January 19, 2000|accessdate=April 19, 2015|archive-date=March 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305163210/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Showtime+Networks+Enhances+Viewing+Experience+With+Dolby+Digital+5.1.-a058659460|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SHOWTIME Launches Dolby Digital on All Channels|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/showtime-launches-dolby-digital-on-all-channels-77269312.html|agency=[[PR Newswire]]|date=May 3, 2002|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archive-date=September 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920083008/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/showtime-launches-dolby-digital-on-all-channels-77269312.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Under CBS Corporation ownership (2005–2019)===
On June 14, 2005, Viacom decided to separate itself into two companies (only six years after the company's acquisition of [[CBS]]), both of which would be controlled by Viacom parent [[National Amusements]], amid stagnation of the company's stock price. When the split was completed on December 31, 2005, the original Viacom was restructured as [[CBS Corporation]] and acquired Showtime Networks along with CBS' broadcasting assets (including the CBS television network, [[UPN]] and the company's broadcast group, which became [[CBS Television Stations]]), Paramount Television (now the separate arms [[CBS Television Studios]] for network and cable production, and [[CBS Television Distribution]] for production of [[broadcast syndication|first-run syndicated programs]] and off-network series distribution), advertising firm Viacom Outdoor (renamed [[Outfront Media|CBS Outdoor]]), [[Simon & Schuster]], and [[Paramount Parks]] (which was later sold to [[Cedar Fair|Cedar Fair, L.P.]] on June 30, 2006). A new company that assumed the [[Viacom (2005–2019)|Viacom]] name kept [[Paramount Pictures]], the [[MTV Networks]] and [[BET Networks]] cable divisions, and [[Famous Music]] (the latter of which was sold to [[Sony-ATV Music Publishing]] in May 2007).<ref>{{cite news|title=Viacom Board Agrees to Split of Company|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/15/business/media/15viacom.html|author=Geraldine Fabrikant|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=June 15, 2005|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-date=March 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306130603/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/15/business/media/15viacom.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=SpongeBob or Survivor?|url=https://money.cnn.com/2005/12/19/news/fortune500/viacom/index.htm|author=Paul R.

==Channels==

===List of channels===
Depending on the service provider, Showtime provides up to sixteen [[multiplex (TV)|multiplex channels]] – eight 24-hour multiplex channels, all of which are simulcast in both [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] and [[high-definition television|high definition]]  – as well as a [[video on demand]] service (Showtime On Demand).<ref>{{cite web|title=About Showtime|url=http://www.sho.com/sho/about|website=Showtime|publisher=[[Showtime Networks]]|accessdate=March 14, 2014|archive-date=May 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514055443/http://www.sho.com/sho/about|url-status=live}}</ref> Showtime broadcasts its primary and multiplex channels on both Eastern and [[Pacific Time Zone]] schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main Showtime channel), resulting in the [[Effects of time zones on North American broadcasting|difference in local airtimes]] for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.

Subscribers to the separate premium film service The Movie Channel, which is also owned by ViacomCBS, do not necessarily have to subscribe to Showtime in order to receive TMC; both The Movie Channel and co-owned fellow movie service Flix are typically sold together in a package (although in the case of Flix, this depends on whether that channel is carried on a particular television provider), though DirecTV and Dish Network alternately sell TMC through a separate film tier. From 1999 to 2005, the package encompassing Showtime and its sister networks was marketed as “Showtime Unlimited”; the broader tier sometimes included the Sundance Channel (now [[SundanceTV]]) during this period, by way of the stake Showtime Networks held in the network from its 1996 inception until Sundance's 2008 purchase by [[AMC Networks|Rainbow Media]].

====Background====
In 1991, after HBO and Cinemax debuted the first premium television multiplex service in the United States, Showtime followed with the testing of its own secondary service – Showtime 2 – on October 1 of that year.<ref name="Showtime 2 test"/> In April 1994, Showtime announced the creation of a new themed multiplex service, consisting of five channels: [[Spanish language]] service Showtime En Espanol; family-oriented Showtime Family Television; action-oriented service Showtime Action Television; a service featuring comedy films and series called Showtime Comedy Television; and an all-movie channel called Showtime Film Festival.<ref>{{cite web|title=Showtime announces five new value-added services|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15417843.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515200949/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15417843.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 15, 2013|author=Richard Katz|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Fairchild Publications|via=HighBeam Research|date=April 25, 1994|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}</ref> This planned extension to the multiplex did not come to fruition – although a third multiplex service, Showtime 3, would make its debut in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=A third from Showtime|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17842950.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515211649/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17842950.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 15, 2013|periodical=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=December 4, 1995}}</ref>

The multiplex would eventually expand over time with the launch of the action film channel Showtime Extreme on March 10, 1998, followed by the debut of the [[science fiction]] channel Showtime Beyond in September 1999; the ''Showtime Unlimited'' name for the Showtime multiplex, TMC and Flix came into use around this time.<ref name=twochannels/> Three additional themed channels made their debut in March 2001: Showtime Family Zone (which carries films intended for family audiences), Showtime Next (a channel featuring films and series that appeal toward adults between the ages of 18 and 34 years old) and Showtime Women (a channel featuring movies, specials, 
and Showtime original programs that appeal toward a female audience).<ref name=showcase/><ref name=twochannels/> The programming format of Showtime 3 was overhauled five months later on July 1, 2001 to focus on theatrical movie releases and Showtime's original made-for-cable films, that under the new name Showcase.

Showtime Family Zone, Showtime Next and Showtime Women do not have distribution by most pay television providers as extensive as the other Showtime multiplex channels. The availability of either of the three channels on cable providers varies depending on the market; [[Dish Network]] only carries Showtime Family Zone, and [[DirecTV]] carries Showtime Next and Showtime Women, but not Showtime Family Zone.

===Other services===

====Showtime HD====
'''Showtime HD''' is a [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of Showtime that broadcasts in the [[1080i]] [[picture format|resolution format]]. In addition to its main channel, all of Showtime's multiplex channels also broadcast in the format, though availability of all of the HD feeds varies by provider. Showtime HD is available through virtually all providers which carry Showtime, along with Showtime's streaming services. Films shown on Showtime's HD simulcast feeds are broadcast in their native [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] if that version is provided by the studios that maintain pay television distribution rights with the channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Netflix, Studios Have Very Different Explanations for Widescreen Cropping|url=http://flavorwire.com/405833/flavorwire-exclusive-netflix-studios-have-very-different-explanations-for-widescreen-cropping|author=Jason Bailey|website=Flavorwire|publisher=Flavorpill Media|date=July 25, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2013|archive-date=August 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808084139/http://flavorwire.com/405833/flavorwire-exclusive-netflix-studios-have-very-different-explanations-for-widescreen-cropping|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Showtime streaming service is identical to Showtime Anytime; it offers a back catalog of episodes of various past and present Showtime original series (with new episodes of Showtime original series being made available for streaming the same day as their original broadcast on the main linear Showtime channel), feature films and documentaries, and sports events and analysis programs.  Subscriptions are also available over Amazon Prime (Amazon Channels), Hulu, The Roku Channel, and Apple TV (Apple TV Channels) as add-ons.  Unlike HBO Now, Showtime also provides live streams of the East and West Coast television feeds of the linear Showtime channel (live streams of Showtime's multiplex services, and sister networks The Movie Channel, The Movie Channel Xtra, and Flix are not currently available on the service; live streams of Showtime's multiplex channels are available for Amazon Prime users as part of the Showtime add-on subscription).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=atv_hm_hom_5_c_h_2_soshofe1?_encoding=UTF8&benefitId=showtimeSub&node=2858778011&pf_rd_i=home&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=2337904342&pf_rd_r=1QJ12TJQN58F8EQ23F5C&pf_rd_s=center-8&pf_rd_t=12401|title=Amazon.com: Amazon Video: Amazon Video|access-date=2017-09-11|archive-date=2016-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421011228/http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=atv_hm_hom_5_c_h_2_soshofe1?_encoding=UTF8&benefitId=showtimeSub&node=2858778011&pf_rd_i=home&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=2337904342&pf_rd_r=1QJ12TJQN58F8EQ23F5C&pf_rd_s=center-8&pf_rd_t=12401|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Showtime launches online without a cable subscription|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/showtime-launches-online-without-a-cable-subscription/|author=Amanda Schupak|website=[[CBS News]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|date=July 7, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015|archive-date=July 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710181416/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/showtime-launches-online-without-a-cable-subscription/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Showtime's stand-alone streaming service launches on Apple, Hulu and elsewhere|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-showtime-s-stand-alone-streaming-service-launches-on-apple-hulu-and-more-20150707-story.html|author=Yvonne Villarreal|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=July 7, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015|archive-date=July 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710031738/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-showtime-s-stand-alone-streaming-service-launches-on-apple-hulu-and-more-20150707-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

====SHO Sync====
On September 22, 2011, Showtime launched '''Showtime Social''', a [[second screen]] interactive app providing interactivity with Showtime programs including viewer-participant polls and trivia questions as well as real-time aggregation of [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and blog comments about particular Showtime programs; the app utilizes Automated Content Recognition technology to generate interactive content regardless of whether it is being watched live, on-demand or by [[digital video recorder|DVR]]; the app also displays [[heat map]]s depicting viewer reactions throughout the duration of an episode at the conclusion of the program. The app – which was renamed '''SHO Sync''' on September 13, 2012 – was originally released for Apple iOS devices (iPad and iPhone), with an app for [[LG Corporation|LG]]-manufactured [[Smart TV]]s being released on August 15, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Showtime Whips Up Social App|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/mobile/showtime-whips-social-app/306243|author=Todd Spangler|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=NewBay Media|date=September 27, 2011|accessdate=July 11, 2015|archive-date=July 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713001155/http://www.multichannel.com/news/mobile/showtime-whips-social-app/306243|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Showtime launches Anytime streaming portal, social iPad app|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/03/showtime-launches-anytime-streaming-portal-social-ipad-app/|author=Richard Lawler|website=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=October 3, 2011|accessdate=July 11, 2013|archive-date=August 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803204137/http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/03/showtime-launches-anytime-streaming-portal-social-ipad-app/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Showtime Syncs Up With LG Smart TVs|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/showtime-syncs-lg-smart-tvs/357794|author=Jeff Baumgartner|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=NewBay Media|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=July 11, 2015|archive-date=July 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713010444/http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/showtime-syncs-lg-smart-tvs/357794|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Showtime and LG Launch Interactive Smart TV App|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/showtime-lg-launch-interactive-smart-607269|author=Michael O'Connell|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=July 11, 2015|archive-date=July 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715104829/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/showtime-lg-launch-interactive-smart-607269|url-status=live}}</ref>

On July 9, 2015, Showtime announced it would discontinue SHO Sync, immediately discontinuing support of the iPad app with the iPhone and LG apps to be discontinued at a later date. However, the channel hinted that the core interactive functions of SHO Sync may be restored in a different form, with the possibility of being incorporated into Showtime Anytime and the Showtime over-the-top streaming service.<ref>{{cite news|title=Showtime to Discontinue 'SHO Sync'|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/next-tv/showtime-discontinue-sho-sync/392052|author=Jeff Baumgartner|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=NewBay Media|date=July 9, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015|archive-date=July 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710222344/http://www.multichannel.com/news/next-tv/showtime-discontinue-sho-sync/392052|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Programming==
{{main|List of Showtime original programming}}
Showtime's programming schedule currently consists largely of theatrically released feature films—which occupy much of the service's daily schedule, varying in quantity depending on channel—and original series targeted at adult audiences (including, {{As of|June 2020|lc=y}}, dramas such as ''[[Shameless (American TV series)|Shameless]]'', ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'', ''[[Billions (TV series)|Billions]]'', ''[[The Chi]]'', ''[[The L Word: Generation Q]]'' and ''[[Penny Dreadful: City of Angels]]''; comedies such as ''[[Black Monday (TV series)|Black Monday]]'', ''[[Our Cartoon President]]'' and ''[[Kidding]]''; and docuseries such as ''[[The Circus: Inside the Greatest Political Show on Earth|The Circus]]'' and ''[[Vice (TV series)|Vice]]''). In addition, Showtime carries documentary films, boxing matches, sports-centric magazine series, occasional original [[stand-up comedy]] specials, and short-form behind-the-scenes specials centered mainly on theatrical films (either running in their initial theatrical or Showtime Networks broadcast window).{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Since the early 1980s, Showtime has run an adult-oriented late night [[Block programming|programming block]] on its main channel called "Showtime After Hours" (which was briefly branded as "Showtime Late Night" during the mid-1990s) each night after 12:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time; programs featured within the block include feature films, series produced specifically for broadcast during the block and occasional stand-up comedy specials.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} [[Softcore pornography|Softcore erotica]] programming has previously aired during the "After Hours" block, though adult films have been absent from Showtime's primary channel since the mid-2000s; the network began broadcasting a limited amount of original erotica series (such as ''[[Beach Heat Miami|Beach Heat: Miami]]'') on its main channel in 2010, after having been absent for most of the previous decade.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} The network's multiplex channels Showtime 2 and Showtime Extreme also occasionally feature adult films during the overnight hours, though this has become less commonplace since late 2011.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Until the formation of Showtime Family Zone in 2001, Showtime heavily incorporated programming aimed at children and teenagers as part of its daytime schedule; in particular, the main channel ran a late afternoon block of teen-oriented series on Sundays (such as ''[[Ready or Not (Canadian TV series)|Ready or Not]]'', ''[[Chris Cross (TV series)|Chris Cross]]'' and ''[[Degrassi High]]''), as well as a morning block of shows aimed at younger children (such as ''[[OWL/TV]]'' and ''[[The Busy World of Richard Scarry]]'') during the early and mid-1990s, and a weekday mid-afternoon and Sunday morning film block called "Showtime Familytime" that ran during the 1980s and 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

The main Showtime network also carried, unusually for a premium channel, news programming; the now-defunct [[All News Channel]] (partially owned by Viacom) produced 90-second long news updates for Showtime in the early 1990s (ANC also produced news updates for fellow Viacom network VH1).{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

===Original programming===
Showtime has become known in recent years for the network's original television programs, the most popular of which include the [[crime drama]] ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', the [[dark comedy|dark]] [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'', family dramas ''[[Ray Donovan]]'' and ''[[Shameless (American TV series)|Shameless]]'' and the drama/thriller series ''Homeland''. Other notable past and present original series include ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' (which ran on Showtime for its first five seasons, before moving to the Sci-Fi Channel (now [[Syfy]]) for the remainder of its run); ''[[Dead Like Me]]''; ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]''; [[Gigolos]]; ''[[Nurse Jackie]]''; ''[[The Tudors]]''; ''[[Brotherhood (American TV series)|Brotherhood]]''; ''[[Soul Food (TV series)|Soul Food]]''; ''[[Queer as Folk (American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]''; ''[[The L Word]]''; ''[[The Big C (TV series)|The Big C]]''; ''[[Penn & Teller: Bullshit!]]''; and ''[[United States of Tara]]''.

Showtime formerly produced its own original [[television film|made-for-cable movies]], originally branded as "Showtime Original Movies" until 1994 and "Showtime Original Pictures" thereafter until the channel discontinued producing television films in 2007. Showtime is also one of only two premium cable services (alongside Disney Channel during its existence as a premium channel prior to 1997) that has produced original movies aimed at family audiences; these films were originally broadcast under the separate banner "Showtime Original Pictures for Kids" from 1995 to 1997 and "Showtime Original Pictures for All Ages" from 1997 to 2005.

Showtime also shows sub-runs – runs of films that have already received broadcast or [[broadcast syndication|syndicated television]] airings – of theatrical films from [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]] (including content from subsidiaries [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Touchstone Pictures]], [[20th Century Studios]], and [[Hollywood Pictures]]), [[Sony Pictures]] (including content from [[Columbia Pictures]], [[TriStar Pictures]], [[Screen Gems]], [[Revolution Studios]] and [[Morgan Creek Productions]]), [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] (including content from [[New Line Cinema]]), [[Miramax]], [[Universal Pictures]] (including content from subsidiary [[Focus Features]]), [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]], [[Bleecker Street (company)|Bleecker Street]] (after [[Prime Video]]'s pay television window for its individual releases concludes), [[Summit Entertainment]] (for films released prior to 2013), [[The Weinstein Company]] (for films released between 2009 and 2016, including those by [[Dimension Films]]), [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (including content from subsidiaries [[United Artists]] and [[Orion Pictures]]), sister company [[Paramount Pictures]], and [[Lionsgate]] (sub-run rights with the latter three studios are for films released prior to 2009).

The window between a film's initial release in theaters and its initial screening on Showtime and sister channels The Movie Channel and Flix is wider than the grace period leading to a film's initial broadcast on HBO/Cinemax, Starz/[[Encore (TV channel)|Encore]], and [[Epix (TV network)|Epix]]. Films that Showtime has pay cable rights to will usually also run on The Movie Channel and Flix during the period of its term of licensing.

The remerger of CBS Corporation and Viacom in 2019 corporately reunited Showtime with [[Paramount Pictures]]. Paramount currently has an output deal with Epix, but it is possible that this will result in new Paramount releases having their first-run rights returned to Showtime after the expiration of the Paramount-Epix deal in 2022.

====Former first-run contracts====
Within years of its launch, Showtime entered into licensing agreements with several movie studios. Following Viacom's 1983 acquisition of a joint stake in The Movie Channel, [[Paramount Pictures]] (then-owned by [[Gulf+Western]]) signed a five-year exclusive first-run distribution agreement with Showtime and The Movie Channel to carry the studio's films through 1989.<ref name="ParamountSues">{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Paramount Sues Viacom Over Fees|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/12/business/the-media-business-paramount-sues-viacom-over-fees.html|author=Geraldine Fabrikant|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 12, 1989|accessdate=March 14, 2014|archive-date=March 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306132520/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/12/business/the-media-business-paramount-sues-viacom-over-fees.html|url-status=live}}</ref> On July 15, 1987, HBO signed a five-year deal with Paramount Pictures to broadcast 85 of their films released from May 1988 onward;<ref>{{cite news|title=HBO Buying Rights To Paramount Films|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/15/business/hbo-buying-rights-to-paramount-films.html|author=Geraldine Fabrikant|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 15, 1987|accessdate=March 14, 2014|archive-date=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202015753/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/15/business/hbo-buying-rights-to-paramount-films.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Pay-TV Rights to 85 Films : Paramount, HBO Sign Licensing Deal|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-15/business/fi-2300_1_licensing-deal|author=Keith Bradsher|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=July 15, 1987|accessdate=March 14, 2014|archive-date=February 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224165933/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-15/business/fi-2300_1_licensing-deal|url-status=live}}</ref> in May 1989, after it signed a licensing deal with HBO, Paramount filed a lawsuit against Showtime Networks, Viacom and its parent National Amusements over Showtime's alleged refusal to pay a total of $88 million in fees for five films (that underperformed in their theatrical release) to reduce the minimum liability for its 75-film package from the studio.<ref name="ParamountSues"/> After Paramount Pictures was purchased by Viacom in 1994, Showtime (which was also owned by Viacom at the time) signed a seven-year distribution deal with that studio which took effect in January 1998, following the expiration of Paramount's contract with HBO.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Showtime Networks (SNI) and Paramount Pictures announce exclusive output deal|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Showtime+Networks+%28SNI%29+and+Paramount+Pictures+announce+exclusive...-a016877979|publisher=Business Wire|via=The Free Library|date=May 18, 1995|accessdate=March 14, 2014|archive-date=April 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403053010/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Showtime+Networks+(SNI)+and+Paramount+Pictures+announce+exclusive...-a016877979|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Paramount Pictures, Lionsgate, and MGM====
The future of Showtime was put into question after negotiations to renew film output deals with Paramount Pictures (which was separated from the channel following the November 2005 split of Viacom and CBS into two separate companies, with CBS Corporation taking ownership of Showtime), MGM, and Lions Gate Entertainment broke down, due to the failure between the studios and Showtime to agree on licensing fees for movies from the channel's three largest film distributors.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paramount Ready to End Movie Sales to Showtime|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/21/business/media/21viacom.html?_r=0&gwh=D850C6825C2821E07CAC8F2D56518A89&gwt=pay|author=Tim Arango|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=April 21, 2008|accessdate=November 14, 2012|archive-date=December 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205193455/https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/21/business/media/21viacom.html?_r=0&gwh=D850C6825C2821E07CAC8F2D56518A89&gwt=pay|url-status=live}}</ref> All three studios then entered into a [[joint venture]], Studio 3 Partners, to form [[Epix (TV network)|Epix]] as a competitor to Showtime, HBO and Starz; Epix debuted in May 2009 as a [[broadband Internet]] service, with the television channel launching on October 30 of that year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Showtime's Film Suppliers Start Up Rival TV Channel|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/showtime%E2%80%99s-film-suppliers-start-rival-tv-channel/32169|author=Robert Marich|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=April 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907170322/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/ca6553110.html|archive-date=September 7, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=New Online TV Channel 'Epix' to Debut in May|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/117280-new-online-tv-channel-epix-to-debut-in-may|author=Seth Gilbert|website=Seeking Alpha|date=January 29, 2009|access-date=February 8, 2009|archive-date=February 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213134541/http://seekingalpha.com/article/117280-new-online-tv-channel-epix-to-debut-in-may|url-status=live}}</ref>

The loss of newer films from Paramount, MGM, and Lions Gate Entertainment left Showtime without rights to any [[major film studio|major studio]]'s films for the first time in the channel's history, leaving "mini-majors" DreamWorks and The Weinstein Company as its principal film distributors, along with agreements with several independent studios.

===Sports programming===
Showtime broadcasts a limited amount of sports programming, which is produced by the channel's Showtime Sports division. Showtime also operates Showtime PPV (formerly Showtime Entertainment Television or SET), which broadcasts boxing matches and other select event programming for [[pay-per-view]]. Beginning in March 1986, Showtime's sports programming consisted largely of [[boxing|boxing matches]] produced under the banner ''[[Showtime Championship Boxing]]''; in 2001, the network launched ''[[ShoBox: The New Generation]]'', focusing primarily on up-and-coming boxers.
