===Non-infectious===
There are a number of non-infectious causes of inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Some of the more common include medications (like [[NSAIDs]]), certain foods such as [[lactose]] (in those who are intolerant), and [[gluten]] (in those with [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]]). [[Crohn's disease]] is also a non-infectious source of (often severe) gastroenteritis.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Disease secondary to [[toxin]]s may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: [[Ciguatera|ciguatera poisoning]] due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, [[scombroid food poisoning|scombroid]] associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, [[Tetrodotoxin#Poisoning|tetrodotoxin poisoning]] from the consumption of [[puffer fish]] among others, and [[botulism]] typically due to improperly preserved food.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=DT|author2=Dobmeier, SG |author3=Bechtel, LK |author4= Holstege, CP |title=Food poisoning.|journal=Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America|date=May 2007 |volume=25|issue=2|pages=357–73; abstract ix|pmid=17482025|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2007.02.014}}</ref>

In the United States, rates of emergency department use for noninfectious gastroenteritis dropped 30% from 2006 until 2011. Of the twenty most common conditions seen in the emergency department, rates of noninfectious gastroenteritis had the largest decrease in visits in that time period.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Skiner HG, Blanchard J, Elixhauser A | title = Trends in Emergency Department Visits, 2006–2011 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #179 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = September 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb179-Emergency-Department-Trends.jsp | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141224224220/http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb179-Emergency-Department-Trends.jsp | archive-date = 2014-12-24 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==

Gastroenteritis is defined as [[vomiting]] or [[diarrhea]] due to inflammation of the [[small bowel|small]] or [[large bowel]], often due to infection.<ref name=M93/> The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while the ones in the large bowel are inflammatory.<ref name=M93/> The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for ''Cryptosporidium'') to as many as 10<sup>8</sup> (for ''Vibrio cholerae'').<ref name=M93/>

==Diagnosis==
Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.<ref name=Eck2011/> Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter management of the condition.<ref name=Web09/>

However, [[stool culture]]s should be performed in those with blood in the stool, those who might have been exposed to [[food poisoning]], and those who have recently traveled to the developing world.<ref name=Webb2005/> It may also be appropriate in children younger than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function.<ref name=IDSA2017>{{cite journal|last1=Shane|first1=Andi L|last2=Mody|first2=Rajal K|last3=Crump|first3=John A|last4=Tarr|first4=Phillip I|last5=Steiner|first5=Theodore S|last6=Kotloff|first6=Karen|last7=Langley|first7=Joanne M|last8=Wanke|first8=Christine|last9=Warren|first9=Cirle Alcantara|last10=Cheng|first10=Allen C|last11=Cantey|first11=Joseph|last12=Pickering|first12=Larry K|title=2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Infectious Diarrhea|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=19 October 2017|doi=10.1093/cid/cix669|pmid=29053792|pmc=5850553|volume=65|issue=12|pages=e45–e80}}</ref> Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance.<ref name=Eck2011/> As [[hypoglycemia]] occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum [[glucose]] in this population is recommended.<ref name=Tint10/> [[Electrolytes]] and [[creatinine|kidney function]] should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.<ref name=Webb2005/>

===Dehydration===
A determination of whether or not the person has [[dehydration]] is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases.<ref name=EBMED2010/> In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged [[capillary refill]], poor [[skin turgor]], and abnormal breathing.<ref name=Tint10/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Steiner|first=MJ |author2=DeWalt, DA |author3-link=Julie Story Byerley |author3=Byerley JS|title=Is this child dehydrated?|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=9 June 2004 |volume=291|issue=22|pages=2746–54|pmid=15187057|doi=10.1001/jama.291.22.2746}}</ref> Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth.<ref name=EBMED2010/> A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring.<ref name=Tint10/> Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Freedman|first1=SB|last2=Vandermeer|first2=B|last3=Milne|first3=A|last4=Hartling|first4=L|last5=Pediatric Emergency Research Canada Gastroenteritis Study|first5=Group|title=Diagnosing clinically significant dehydration in children with acute gastroenteritis using noninvasive methods: a meta-analysis.|journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|date=April 2015|volume=166|issue=4|pages=908–916.e6|pmid=25641247|doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2014.12.029}}</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===
Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include [[appendicitis]], [[volvulus]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[urinary tract infection]]s, and [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name=Webb2005/> Pancreatic insufficiency, [[short bowel syndrome]], [[Whipple's disease]], [[coeliac disease]], and [[laxative]] abuse should also be considered.<ref name="Oxford">{{cite book|editor1=Warrell D.A. |editor2=Cox T.M. |editor3=Firth J.D. |editor4=Benz E.J. |title=The Oxford Textbook of Medicine |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-19-262922-7 |edition=4th |url=http://otm.oxfordmedicine.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321002102/http://otm.oxfordmedicine.com/ |archive-date=2012-03-21 }}</ref> The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits ''only'' vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).<ref name=EBMED2010/>

Appendicitis may present with vomiting, abdominal pain, and a small amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases.<ref name=EBMED2010/> This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea.<ref name=EBMED2010/> Classical [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea.<ref name=EBMED2010/> One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.<ref name=EBMED2010/>

==Prevention==
[[File:RotavirusV2009.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|Percentage of rotavirus tests with positive results, by surveillance week, United States, July 2000 – June 2009.]]

===Lifestyle===
A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good [[sanitation]] practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.<ref name=M93/> Personal measures (such as [[hand washing]] with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.<ref name=Tint10/> Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.<ref name=Tint10/> Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.<ref>{{cite web|title=Viral Gastroenteritis |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/gastro/faq.htm |work=Center for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=16 April 2012 |date=February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424073547/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/gastro/faq.htm |archive-date=24 April 2012 }}</ref>
[[Breastfeeding]] is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.<ref name=Web09/> Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.<ref name=EBMED2010/>

===Vaccination===

==Society and culture==
Gastroenteritis is associated with many colloquial names, including "[[Montezuma's revenge]]", "Delhi belly", "la turista", and "back door sprint", among others.<ref name=M93/> It has played a role in many military campaigns and is believed to be the origin of the term "no guts no glory".<ref name=M93/>
