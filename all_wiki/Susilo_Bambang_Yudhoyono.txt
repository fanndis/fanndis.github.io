'''Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono''' ({{IPA-jv|susiɭɔ b̥amb̥aŋ juɖ̥ɔjɔnɔ|lang|Id-Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.ogg}}; born 9 September 1949), commonly referred to by his initials '''SBY''', is an Indonesian politician and retired [[Indonesian Army|Army]] general who served as the sixth [[president of Indonesia]] from 2004 to 2014. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (Indonesia)|Democratic Party]] and President of the Assembly and Chair of the Council of the [[Global Green Growth Institute]]. Yudhoyono was also the former Chairman of ASEAN due to [[Indonesia]] hosting the 18th and 19th ASEAN Summits.

Yudhoyono won the [[2004 Indonesian presidential election|2004 presidential election]]—the first [[Direct election|direct]] presidential election in Indonesia, defeating incumbent President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]]. He was sworn into office on 20 October 2004, together with [[Jusuf Kalla]] as [[List of Vice Presidents of Indonesia|Vice-President]]. He ran for [[2009 Indonesian presidential election|re-election in 2009]] with [[Boediono]] as his running mate, and won with an outright majority of the votes in the first round of balloting; he was sworn in for a second term on 20 October 2009.

==Early life==
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is of [[Javanese people|Javanese]] descent. He was born in Tremas, a village in Arjosari, [[Pacitan Regency]], [[East Java]], to a lower-middle-class family and is the son of Raden Soekotjo and Siti Habibah.<ref name="ANTARA">{{cite news|title = Presiden Yudhoyono Hari Ini Berusia 59 Tahun|url = http://www.antara.co.id/view/?i=1220923024&c=NAS|publisher = [[ANTARA]]|date = 9 September 2008|language = id|access-date = 23 June 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100402005118/http://www.antara.co.id/view/?i=1220923024&c=NAS|archive-date = 2 April 2010|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

''Yudhoyono'' comes from the words ''yuddha'' -meaning ''battle, fight''; and ''yana'', meaning ''journey''.<ref name=sanskrit/> Thus his full name roughly translates to "well behaved knight".

Yudhoyono had wanted to join the army since he was a child.<ref name="Kompas">{{cite news|first=Wisnu |last=Nugroho |title=Menjadi Tentara adalah Cita-cita SBY Kecil |url=http://www2.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0406/24/Sosok/1105275.htm |work=[[Kompas]] |date=24 June 2004 |language=id |access-date=23 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710044948/http://www2.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0406/24/Sosok/1105275.htm |archive-date=10 July 2009  }}</ref> In school, he developed a reputation as an academic achiever, excelling in writing poems, short stories, and play-acting{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. Yudhoyono was also talented in music and sport, reflected when he and his friends established a volleyball club called ''Klub Rajawali'' and a band called ''Gaya Teruna''.<ref>{{cite news|first = Fauzan|last = Jayadi|title = Berani-beraninya Menggoda Putri Jenderal|url = http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0404/04/pem8.htm|work = [[Suara Merdeka]]|date = 4 June 2004|language = id|access-date = 23 June 2009|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090115210317/http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0404/04/pem8.htm|archive-date = 15 January 2009|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

When he was in fifth grade, Yudhoyono visited the Indonesian Armed Forces Academy (AKABRI). After seeing the soldiers training there and perhaps inspired by his own father's career, Yudhoyono became determined to join [[Indonesian Armed Forces]] and become a soldier. Yudhoyono planned to enlist after graduating from high school in 1968; however, he missed the registration period.<ref name="Kompas"/>

Yudhoyono then became a student of Department of Mechanical Engineering at the [[Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember]] (ITS) in Surabaya before entering the Vocational Education Development Center in [[Malang]], East Java. There, he was able to prepare everything for the next phase of his education at Akabri. Yudhoyono officially entered AKABRI in 1970 after passing the test in [[Bandung]].<ref name="Kompas"/>

==Military career==
[[File:Sergeant Major Yudhoyono.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Cadet First Sergeant Major ("Sersan Mayor Satu Taruna") Yudhoyono, 1973.]]
Yudhoyono spent three years at Indonesian Armed Forces Academy (AKABRI) and became the Commander of the Cadet Corps Division there. He graduated from AKABRI as second lieutenant in 1973, and as the best graduate of the year, received the prestigious Adhi Makayasa medal from President [[Suharto]].

After graduating, Yudhoyono joined the [[Kostrad|Army Strategic Reserve]] (Kostrad) and became a [[platoon]] commander in the 330th Airborne Battalion. Aside from leading his troops, Yudhoyono was also tasked with giving the battalion soldiers lessons on general knowledge and English. Yudhoyono's proficiency in English was one of the reasons why he was sent to the United States to undertake the [[United States Army Airborne School|Airborne]] and [[Ranger School|Ranger]] Courses at [[Fort Benning]] in 1975.

Yudhoyono returned to Indonesia in 1976 where he became a platoon commander in the 305th Battalion and assigned to [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian-occupied]] [[East Timor]]. Yudhoyono had several tours of duty and, like many other Indonesian officers involved in the occupation of East Timor, was accused of committing [[war crimes]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} However, Yudhoyono has never been charged with any specific act. From East Timor, Yudhoyono became a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] platoon commander in 1977, an operations officer for an airborne brigade from 1977 to 1978, and a battalion commander at Kostrad from 1979 to 1981. Yudhoyono then spent 1981 and 1982 working at the Army headquarters.

While working at the Army headquarters, Yudhoyono was sent to the United States again, this time to participate in the [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry Officer Advanced Course]] at Fort Benning and in training with the [[82nd Airborne Division (United States)|82nd Airborne Division]]. Yudhoyono also spent time in [[Panama]] and went through the jungle warfare school. When Yudhoyono returned in 1983, he was made Commander of the Infantry Trainers' School. It was not long before he was abroad again, this time to [[Belgium]] and [[West Germany]], to undertake the [[Antitank weapon]]s Course. In 1985, Yudhoyono also took a Battalion Commando Course in [[Malaysia]].

From 1986 to 1988, Yudhoyono served with [[Kodam IX/Udayana]], which covers [[Bali]] and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. Yudhoyono was a battalion commander from 1986 to 1988 and was part of the operational staff in 1988. In 1989, Yudhoyono became a lecturer at the Army Staff College (Seskoad) and delivered a presentation entitled "ABRI's Professionalism at the Present and in the Future". Together with [[Agus Wirahadikusumah]], Yudhoyono published a book entitled "The Challenges of Development".

Whilst at Seskoad, Yudhoyono also took the opportunity to further his own military education. He went to the [[US Army Command and General Staff College]] at [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]]. While in the United States, he took the opportunity to obtain an MA degree in business management from [[Webster University]] in 1991.

In 1992, Yudhoyono was transferred to the Army Information Department and worked as a speech writer for General Edi Sudrajat, the Army Chief of Staff. In 1993, when Edi became Commander of the [[Military of Indonesia]] (ABRI), Yudhoyono joined Edi's personal staff. Edi did not last long as ABRI Commander and Yudhoyono was then transferred back to Kostrad where he became a brigade commander. A year later, Yudhoyono was the Operations Assistant at Jaya (Jakarta) Military Area Command before taking command IV/Diponegoro Military Area Command in [[Central Java]]. Yudhoyono had one more stint overseas when he became Indonesia's chief military observer of the [[UN peacekeeping|United Nation Peacekeeping Force]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] in 1995–96.<ref>{{cite news|title=Indonesian armed forces promotes 12 officers| first=Paul| last=Jacob |date=7 November 1995|work=Straits Times |location=Singapore }}</ref>

When Yudhoyono returned to Indonesia, he was made KODAM Jaya chief of staff before being appointed as KODAM II/Sriwijaya commander. In this position, Yudhoyono was responsible for military operations in southern [[Sumatra]].<ref>{{cite news |title=General declares "war against instigators, agitators and rioters" |work=Kompas |date=11 February 1997 |agency=BBC Summary of World Broadcasts }}</ref> He served in this position until 1997, when he was appointed chief of staff for social-political affairs. At the same time, he was also appointed Chairman of the ABRI Faction in the People's Consultative Assembly General Session and participated in [[Suharto]]'s election to a seventh term as president.

[[File:SBY military potrait.jpg|thumb|General Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in official military portrait, 2000.]]
During the days which would lead to [[Fall of Suharto|Suharto's resignation]] in May 1998, Yudhoyono and pro-reform ABRI officers conducted meetings and discussions with [[Nurcholish Madjid]], a secular pro-reform Muslim leader. From his discussions, Yudhoyono accepted the fact that Suharto should resign but like the ABRI officers who went to the meeting with him, was reluctant to withdraw their support of Suharto publicly, much less ask for Suharto's resignation.<ref name="Friend">{{Cite book|last = Friend|first = Theodore|author-link = Theodore Friend|title = Indonesian Destinies|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2003|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn = 0-674-01834-6|url = https://books.google.com/?id=_w6Mn4xRLt8C}}</ref> Nevertheless, the pressure would eventually become too much for Suharto, who resigned on 21 May 1998.

As Indonesia entered the [[Post-Suharto era|reform era]], ABRI's popularity, because of its association with Suharto, was at an all-time low. To de-emphasise ABRI's political role, Yudhoyono's Chief of Staff for social-political affairs was renamed chief of staff for territorial affairs and in 1999, ABRI was renamed TNI and the [[Indonesian National Police]] (Polri) was split off. At this time, Yudhoyono's popularity began to increase{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} as he offered ideas and concepts to reform the military and nation. He did this by combining the strong reformist sentiment of the time with TNI's concern for security and stability.<ref name="Friend"/> Because of his high education (finishing his doctorate during the course of the presidential elections) and his well planned manoeuvres, Yudhoyono came to be known as "the thinking general".<ref>Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1QpWEAtDjWMC&pg=PA112&dq=Yudhoyono+thinking+general&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sxrMUpvrMMjmsAT5q4KYDQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Yudhoyono%20thinking%20general&f=false Emerging Democracy in Indonesia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108032308/https://books.google.com/books?id=1QpWEAtDjWMC&pg=PA112&dq=Yudhoyono+thinking+general&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sxrMUpvrMMjmsAT5q4KYDQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Yudhoyono%20thinking%20general&f=false |date=8 January 2016 }}, 2005</ref>

==Political career==

===Wahid Presidency===
Yudhoyono was appointed Mining and Energy Minister in the [[National Unity Cabinet|cabinet]] of President [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] in 1999. According to General [[Wiranto]], who assisted Wahid in the formation of the Cabinet, he had recommended to the President that Yudhoyono would do better as Army Chief of Staff.<ref>{{cite book |last = Wiranto|title = Bersaksi Di Tengah Badai: Dari Catatan Wiranto, Jenderal Purnawirawan|publisher = Ide Indonesia|year = 2003 |location = Jakarta |pages = 229–232 |isbn = 979-96845-1-X }}</ref> However, Wahid rejected the idea and Yudhoyono became the Minister of Mining and Energy instead. At the same time, Yudhoyono ended his military career with the rank of [[Lieutenant General]], although he would be made honorary General in 2000.

Yudhoyono's popularity grew,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} even as Minister of Mining and Energy. In June 2000, there were rumours that Wahid, because of his lack of skill as an administrator was going to appoint a First Minister to look after the day-to-day running of the Government.<ref>{{cite book |last = Barton |first = Greg |title = Abdurrahman Wahid: Muslim Democrat, Indonesian President |publisher = UNSW Press |year = 2002 |location = Singapore |page = [https://archive.org/details/abdurrahmanwahid00bart/page/320 320] |isbn = 0-86840-405-5 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/abdurrahmanwahid00bart/page/320 }}</ref> Yudhoyono's name appeared as a potential candidate for the position, although eventually Wahid appointed Vice-President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] as the day to day administrator.

In August 2000, after a Cabinet reshuffle, Yudhoyono became the Coordinating Minister for Politic and Security Affairs. One of his tasks was to separate the army from politics. This was in line with his reformist ideas on the future of Indonesian military, and is a view he has held since his days in an army policy center. He said at that time:

{{cquote|Since 1998, the military has decided to stay out of day-to-day politics. The basic idea of military reform is to go back to the role and function of the military as a defense force and move them away from politics systematically. The trend is moving in such a way that there is no so-called 'dual function' of the military, there is no so-called social political mission in the military.}}

Another task that Yudhoyono was given was as an intermediary between Wahid and the Suharto family. At the time, Wahid was trying to make Suharto hand back all the money which he had allegedly obtained through corruption when he was president. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Yudhoyono was sent by Wahid to convey this wish and to negotiate with the former first family. However, Yudhoyono was not successful in this venture.

At the beginning of 2001, with political pressure increasing on him, Wahid ordered Yudhoyono to form a crisis centre with Yudhoyono as chairman<ref name=toko>{{Cite web|url=http://tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/s/susilo-b-yudhoyono/biografi/jenderal.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20090122204352/http://tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/s/susilo-b-yudhoyono/biografi/jenderal.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Jenderal yang Berpikir &#124; Biografi Tokoh Indonesia|access-date=18 April 2011|archive-date=22 January 2009}}</ref> The purpose of this crisis centre was to assist the president in giving policy advice and was headquartered at Yudhoyono's office. It seemed as if because of this appointment, Yudhoyono could be considered one of Wahid's men, however Yudhoyono would break ranks from Wahid in July 2001 when the latter was facing impeachment. In desperation, Wahid issued a decree freezing the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) and then asked Yudhoyono to declare a [[state of emergency]] to further strengthen his position. Yudhoyono refused to accept this, and Wahid dismissed him.<ref name=sbybbc>Rachel Harvey, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3725301.stm "Profile: Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820023226/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3725301.stm |date=20 August 2006 }}, BBC News, 20 October 2004.</ref>

===Megawati Presidency===
On 23 July 2001, in a Special Session, the MPR impeached Wahid and replaced him with Megawati as president. A few days later when the MPR assembled to elect a new vice-president, Yudhoyono threw his name in the hat and competed against [[Golkar]]'s [[Akbar Tanjung]] and [[United Development Party]]'s (PPP) [[Hamzah Haz]].<ref name=toko/> Yudhoyono and Akbar lost out to Hamzah who became the vice-president.

Yudhoyono was appointed to his old position of Coordinating Minister of Political and Security Affairs in Megawati's [[Mutual Assistance Cabinet|new cabinet]]. After the [[2002 Bali terrorist bombing|October 2002 Bali bombing]], he oversaw the hunt for and arrest of those responsible, and gained a reputation both in Indonesia and abroad as one of the few Indonesian politicians serious about the [[War on Terrorism]]. His speech during the one-year anniversary of the Bali bombing (in which many Australians were killed) was praised by the Australian media and public.<ref name=sbybbc/>

Yudhoyono also dealt with the [[Free Aceh Movement]] (GAM), a separatist movement wanting to separate the Province of [[Aceh]] from Indonesia. On his advice, Megawati declared [[martial law]] in Aceh on 19 May 2003. This martial law was then extended in November 2003.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213105/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/1103/04/0501.htm Darurat Militer Diperpanjang], Pikiran Rakyat, 6 November 2003</ref>

===The Democratic Party===
Yudhoyono's supporters saw Yudhoyono's participation in the vice-presidential election as a sign of his popularity and recognised Yudhoyono's potential as a possible leader for Indonesia. One of these supporters, Vence Rumangkang approached Yudhoyono with the idea of forming a political party to help shore up support for the 2004 Presidential Elections. Yudhoyono approved of the idea and after going through the basic concepts, left Rumangkang in charge of forming the Party.

From 12–19 August 2001, Rumangkang began holding a series of meetings to discuss the formation of the party while holding consultations with Yudhoyono. Yudhoyono personally led the meetings on 19 and 20 August 2001, and the basic outline of the [[Democratic Party (Indonesia)|Democratic Party]] was finalised.

On 9 September 2001, the formation of the party was officially declared and on 10 September it was registered at the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights.

The organizers behind Democratic Party's formation went to extreme lengths to make sure that PD was Yudhoyono's personal political party. The declaration of its formation was 9 September 2001, which was Yudhoyono's birthday and to start off with, the Party had 99 members.

===Road to Presidency===
{{BLP sources|date=January 2007}}
By 2003 there was a gathering momentum behind the possibility of Yudhoyono being a presidential candidate.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070516022522/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0403/12/opini/908892.htm Menakar Karier Politik SB Yudhoyono], Kompas, 12 March 2004</ref> The [[Democratic Nationhood Party|United Democratic Nationhood Party]] (PPDK) was the first to bring up the subject of nomination. In September 2003, Yudhoyono's own party began to make preparations in case Yudhoyono was willing to accept a presidential nomination. The Democratic Party then initiated a publicity campaign to promote Yudhoyono as a candidate. For his part, Yudhoyono was not responsive both to PPDK or the Democratic Party's manoeuvrings to nominate him and continued his duties as Minister. PPDK was disappointed in Yudhoyono's reaction and the Democratic Party continued to wait for Yudhoyono to resign his position as was expected of all presidential candidates apart from the incumbent president and Vice-President.

[[File:SBYgaruda.jpg|thumb|left|Yudhoyono with his wife at opening of new [[Garuda Indonesia]] headquarters]]

The turning point came on 1 March 2004, when Yudhoyono's secretary, Sudi Silalahi announced to the media that for the last six months, Yudhoyono had been excluded from policy decision-making in the field of politics and security.<ref>[http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0403/12/nas1.htm Harian Umum Suara Merdeka] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202012/http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0403/12/nas1.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}, 12 March 2004</ref> On 2 March 2004, Megawati responded that she had never excluded Yudhoyono, while her husband, [[Taufiq Kiemas]] called Yudhoyono childish for complaining to the media instead of the president herself. On 8 March 2004, Yudhoyono sent a letter asking for permission to meet the president about his ministerial authority. Megawati did not respond when she received the letter, although she invited Yudhoyono along to a cabinet meeting on 11 March 2004. Yudhoyono did not attend the cabinet meeting and instead held a press conference at his office and announced his resignation from the position of Coordinating Minister of Political and security affairs. He also announced that he was ready to be nominated as a presidential candidate.

[[File:Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.jpg|thumb|right|184px|Yudhoyono in United Nations.]]

Yudhoyono's popularity skyrocketed after his falling out with Megawati as he was seen by the people as the [[underdog (competition)|underdog]]. However this popularity did not translate to a victory for the Democratic Party at the [[2004 Indonesian legislative election|2004 legislative elections]]. The party won 7.5% of the votes, which was still enough to nominate Yudhoyono as a presidential candidate. Yudhoyono accepted the nomination and picked [[Golkar]]'s [[Jusuf Kalla]] as his running mate. Aside from the Democratic Party, their presidential and vice-presidential candidacy was supported by the [[Crescent Star Party (Indonesia)|Crescent Star Party]] (PBB), the [[Reform Star Party]] (PBR) and the [[Indonesian Justice and Unity Party]] (PKPI).<ref>[http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/nasional/2004/05/06/brk,20040506-32,id.html Yudhoyono – Kalla Resmi Daftar ke KPU] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322103127/http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/nasional/2004/05/06/brk,20040506-32,id.html |date=22 March 2007 }}, Tempointeraktif.com, 10 May 2004</ref>

Yudhoyono's [[manifesto]] for the future of Indonesia, summarised in a book titled "Vision For Change" written by him and distributed for free during the campaign, was built on four pillars: prosperity, peace, justice and democracy. At the top of his agenda was a plan for increasing economic prosperity, aiming for economic growth of at least 7% and a revival of small and medium-sized enterprises. He also put forward policies to offer better credit lines, to cut red tape, improve labour laws and to root out corruption from the top down. He told an interviewer:

{{cquote|If we are to reduce poverty, create jobs, increase purchasing power and rebuild infrastructure, then we will need new capital. Of course, to be able to invite investment, I have to improve the climate – legal certainties, political stability, law and order, sound tax policies, customs policies, good labor management. I will improve the guarantees to encourage investors to come to Indonesia.}}

Yudhoyono's perceived communication skills made him the front-runner throughout the election campaign, according to many opinion polls and the opinions of election commentators,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lsi.co.id/artikel.php?id=221|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522145330/http://www.lsi.co.id/artikel.php?id=221|url-status=dead|title=Lingkaran Survey Indonesia – Opini & Analisis Direktur – Mengalahkan Megawati di Tahun 2004?|archive-date=22 May 2008}}</ref> ahead of the other candidates (Megawati, Wiranto, [[Amien Rais]], and Hamzah). On 5 July 2004, Yudhoyono participated in the first round of the [[2004 Indonesian presidential election|presidential election]], coming first with 33% of the votes. However, 50% of votes were required for a new president and vice-president to be elected, and this meant Yudhoyono going into a run-off against Megawati.

In the run-off, Yudhoyono faced a challenge from Megawati's [[Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle]] (PDI-P), forming a national coalition with Golkar, the PPP, [[Prosperous Peace Party]] (PDS) and the [[Indonesian National Party]] (PNI). Yudhoyono then declared that his coalition, which now received political support from the [[National Awakening Party]] (PKB), the [[Prosperous Justice Party]] (PKS) and the [[National Mandate Party]] (PAN), would be the people's coalition. On 20 September 2004, Yudhoyono participated in the run-off election, winning it with 60.87% of the vote. Yudhoyono was inaugurated as president on 20 October 2004. In February 2010, SBY was named as the political figure who had achieved {{YouTube|FLW0HPTiBRc|The Gold Standard in Political Communications}} by the influential PublicAffairsAsia network and magazine.

===Cabinet===
The day of his inauguration in 2004, Yudhoyono announced his new cabinet, which would be known as the [[United Indonesia Cabinet]] (''Kabinet Indonesia Bersatu''). Consisting of 36 ministers, it included members of the Democratic Party, Golkar and the PPP, PBB, PKB, PAN, PKP, and PKS. Professionals were also named in the cabinet, most of them taking on ministries in the economic field. The [[Military of Indonesia|military]] were also included, with five former members appointed to the cabinet. As Yudhoyono's promised during the election, four of the cabinet appointees were female.<ref>[http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/nasional/2004/09/29/brk,20040929-01,id.html SBY Akan Tunjuk 4 Wanita] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315150943/http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/nasional/2004/09/29/brk,20040929-01,id.html |date=15 March 2007 }}. Tempointeraktif.Com (29 September 2004). Retrieved 18 April 2011.</ref>

Yudhoyono's [[Second United Indonesia Cabinet]] was announced in October 2009 after he was re-elected as president earlier in the year. The vice-president in Yudhoyono's second cabinet was Dr. [[Boediono]].  Boediono replaced [[Jusuf Kalla]] who was vice-president in the first Yudhoyono cabinet.

Presidential elections were held in Indonesia on 8 July 2009.  President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono won more than 60% (60.08%) of the vote in the first round, which enabled him to secure re-election without a run-off. Yudhoyono was officially declared the victor of the election on 23 July 2009, by the General Election Commission. Other candidates are Megawati Sukarnoputri PDI-P Party 26.79%, Jusuf Kalla Golkar Party 12.41%.

===Economy===
In late 2007, Yudhoyono led Indonesia into a [[free trade agreement]] with Japan.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090108070235/http://www.bilaterals.org/article.php3?id_article=9408 Japan-Indonesia FTA (2007)], Bilaterals.org, 21 August 2007</ref>

===Education and health===
In July 2005, Yudhoyono launched the Schools Operational Assistance (BOS) program.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080112090908/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/2005/0705/27/0101.htm Pemerintah Cairkan Dana Kompensasi BBM], Pikiran Rakyat, 27 July 2005</ref> Under this arrangement, the government gives money to principals to financially assist in the running of schools. Should BOS be able to provide significant financial assistance to the school then the school is expected to lower fees or, if they are able to, to abolish fees altogether. In June 2006, Yudhoyono launched Books BOS which provides funds for the purchase of textbooks.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070305171848/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0606/05/humaniora/2702049.htm BOS Buku Digunakan UN], Kompas, 5 June 2006</ref>

In January 2005, Yudhoyono launched the Poor Community Health Insurance (Askeskin). Askeskin is a program directed at poor people which allows them access to healthcare.<ref>Adang Setiana [https://web.archive.org/web/20080113085750/http://menkokesra.go.id/content/view/1916/98/ Social Health Insurance Development as an Integral Part of the National Health Policy: Recent Reform in the Indonesian Health Insurance System], Coordinating Ministry for People's Welfare the Republic of Indonesia, Jakarta</ref>

===Balance of power with Vice-President Kalla===
Although he had won the Presidency, Yudhoyono was still weak in the Indonesian parliament, the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR). The Democratic Party, even combined with all of its coalition partners, had far fewer representatives than Golkar and the PDI-P, which played the role of opposition.

With a national congress to be held in December 2004, Yudhoyono and Kalla had originally backed Agung Laksono speaker to become Golkar chairman. When Agung was perceived to be too weak to run against Akbar, Yudhoyono and Kalla threw their weight behind Surya Paloh. Finally, when Paloh was perceived to be too weak to run against Akbar, Yudhoyono gave the green light for Kalla to run for the Golkar Chairmanship.<ref>[http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0412/20/nas02.htm Nasional] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402121625/http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0412/20/nas02.htm |date=2 April 2017 }}. Suara Merdeka. Retrieved 18 April 2011.</ref> On 19 December 2004, Kalla was elected as the new chairman of Golkar.

Kalla's victory posed a dilemma for Yudhoyono. Although it now enabled Yudhoyono to pass legislation, Kalla's new position meant that he was now more powerful than Yudhoyono in terms of influence in parliament.

After the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] Kalla, apparently on his own initiative, assembled Ministers and signed a vice-presidential decree ordering work to begin on rehabilitating Aceh. The legality of his vice-presidential decree was questioned<ref>{{cite book |last = Redaksi Tempo|title = SBY-JK Duet Atau Duel: Edisi Khusus Setahun Pemerintahan SBY-JK|date = 24–30 October 2005 |location = Jakarta, Indonesia |page = 41}}</ref> although Yudhoyono maintained that it was he who gave the orders for Kalla to proceed.

In September 2005, when Yudhoyono went to New York to attend the annual United Nations Summit, he left Vice-President Kalla in charge. Yudhoyono held a [[video conference]] from New York to receive reports from ministers. Critics suggest that this was an expression of distrust by Yudhoyono.<ref>{{cite book |last = Redaksi Tempo|title = SBY-JK Duet Atau Duel: Edisi Khusus Setahun Pemerintahan SBY-JK|date = 24–30 October 2005 |location = Jakarta, Indonesia |page = 40}}</ref> The suggestion seemed to gain momentum when Kalla only showed up for one video conference and then spent the rest of the time taking care of Golkar matters.

The alleged rivalry resurfaced again in October 2006 when Yudhoyono established the Presidential Work Unit for the Organization of Reform Program (UKP3R). He tasked it with improving the conditions for business investment, executing government diplomacy and administration, improving the performance of the state-owned enterprises, expanding the role of small and medium businesses, and improving law enforcement as a whole.<ref>Marsillam Simanjuntak, [https://archive.today/20090103162031/http://www.tokohindonesia.com/ensiklopedi/m/marsillam-simanjuntak/index.shtml Demokrat Berintegritas Tinggi]</ref> The UKP3R was headed by [[Marsillam Simanjuntak]], who served as Attorney General during the Wahid Presidency.

In February 2007, Yudhoyono added welfare to UKP3R's tasks by ordering them to also put focus on the abolition of poverty, the direct cash assistance, public service as well as assisting programs in health and education<ref>[http://www.presidensby.info/index.php/fokus/2007/02/09/1562.html Presiden Republik Indonesia – Dr. H.

On 6 May 2005, Yudhoyono visited Suharto at hospital when the latter suffered from intestinal bleeding.
