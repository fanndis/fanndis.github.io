'''''The Economist''''' is an international [[weekly newspaper]] printed in [[Bookbinding#Thermally activated binding|magazine-format]] and [[Electronic publishing|published digitally]] that focuses on [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]], international business, politics, and technology. Based in [[London]], England, the newspaper is owned by [[Economist Group|The Economist Group]], with core editorial offices in the United States, as well as across major cities in continental Europe, Asia, and the [[Middle East]]. In August 2015, [[Pearson plc|Pearson]] sold its 50 percent stake in the newspaper to the Italian [[Agnelli family]]'s investment company, [[Exor (company)|Exor]], for [[Pound sign|£]]469 million ([[United States dollar|US$]]531 million) and the paper re-acquired the remaining shares for £182 million ($206 million). In 2019, their average global print circulation was over 909,476, while combined with their digital presence, runs to over 1.6 million. Across their social media platforms, it reaches an audience of 35 million, as of 2016. The newspaper has a prominent focus on [[data journalism]] and analysis over [[News media|original reporting]], to both criticism and acclaim.<!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

Founded in 1843, ''The Economist'' was first circulated by Scottish economist [[James Wilson (businessman)|James Wilson]] to muster support for abolishing the British [[Corn Laws]] (1815–46), a system of [[Tariff|import tariffs]]. Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into [[political economy]] and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. Throughout the mid- to late 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, adding opinion columns, special reports, [[political cartoon]]s, [[Letter to the editor|reader letters]], cover stories, art critique, book reviews, and technology features. The paper is often recognizable by its [[fire engine red|fire-engine-red]] nameplate and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with [[Byline|no byline]], in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. The paper is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, ''[[1843 (magazine)|1843]]'', and a variety of podcasts, films, and books.

The [[The Economist editorial stance|editorial stance of ''The Economist'']] primarily revolves around [[classical liberalism|classical]], [[Social liberalism|social]], and most notably, [[economic liberalism]]. Since its founding, it has supported [[radical centrism]], favoring policies and governments that maintain [[Centrism|centrist politics]]. The newspaper typically champions [[neoliberalism]], particularly [[free market]]s, [[free trade]], [[free immigration]], [[deregulation]], and [[Globalization|globalisation]]. Despite a pronounced editorial stance, it is seen as having little [[reporting bias]], rigorous [[Fact-checking|fact checking]] and strict [[copy editing]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2009/04/when-will-magazines-stop-trying-to-copy-the-economist|title=Why Time and Newsweek Will Never Be The Economist|last=Pressman|first=Matt|date=April 20, 2009|website=Vanity Fair|language=en|access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/berlinschoolofcreativeleadership/2017/02/01/10-journalism-brands-where-you-will-find-real-facts-rather-than-alternative-facts/|title=10 Journalism Brands Where You Find Real Facts Rather Than Alternative Facts|last=Leadership|first=The Berlin School Of Creative|date=February 1, 2017|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=March 10, 2020}}</ref> Its extensive use of [[word play]], [[Subscription (finance)|subscription]] prices, and typical depth of coverage has linked the paper with a high-income and educated readership, drawing both positive and negative connotations in the [[Western world]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2019/01/31/why-the-economist-swapped-its-famous-elitist-marketing-emotional-messaging|title=Why The Economist swapped its famous elitist marketing for emotional messaging|last=Burnell|first=Ian|date=31 January 2019|website=The Drum|language=en|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809015245/https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2019/01/31/why-the-economist-swapped-its-famous-elitist-marketing-emotional-messaging|archive-date=9 August 2020|access-date=11 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Peters|first=Jeremy W.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/09/business/media/09economist.html|title=The Economist Tends Its Sophisticate Garden|date=2010-08-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In line with this, it claims to have influential readership of prominent business leaders and [[Policy|policy-makers]].

Wilson described it as taking part in "a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress", a phrase which still appears on its masthead as the publication's mission.<ref name="opinion">{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/opinion/ |title=Opinion: leaders and letters to the Editor |work=The Economist |access-date=1 May 2011}}</ref> It has long been respected as "one of the most competent and subtle Western periodicals on public affairs".<ref name="Leites">{{cite journal|title=The Politburo Through Western Eyes|pages=159–185|author=Nathan Leites|journal=[[World Politics]]|year=1952|volume=4|issue=2|jstor=2009044|doi=10.2307/2009044}}{{subscription required}}</ref> It was cited by [[Karl Marx]] in his formulation of socialist theory, because Marx felt the publication epitomised the interests of the bourgeoisie.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YauuCwAAQBAJ&q=%22the%20london%20economist%22%20read%20by%20marx&pg=PA242|title=Karl Marx: His Life and Thought|last=McLellan|first=David|date=1 December 1973|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349155149|language=en}}</ref> He wrote: "the London ''Economist'', the European organ of the aristocracy of finance, described most strikingly the attitude of this class."<ref>Karl Marx, ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'', VI (1852)</ref> In 1915, revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]] referred to ''The Economist'' as a "journal that speaks for British millionaires".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Zevin|first=Alex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOC2DwAAQBAJ&q=journal+that+speaks+for+British+millionaires&pg=PA164|title=Liberalism at Large: The World According to the Economist|date=2019-11-12|publisher=Verso Books|isbn=978-1-78168-624-9|language=en}}</ref> Additionally Lenin claimed that ''The Economist'' held a "bourgeois-pacifist" position and supported peace out of fear of [[revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/may/01c.htm|title=Bourgeois Philanthropists and Revolutionary Social-Democracy}}</ref>[[File:The Economist 2019 1 o.jpg|left|thumb|A panel of journalists and public policy leaders at ''The Economist''<nowiki/>'s 2019 India Summit.<nowiki/>]]In 1920, the paper's circulation rose to 6,170.

Articles involving economics do not presume any formal training on the part of the reader and aim to be accessible to the educated layman. It usually does not translate short French (and German) quotes or phrases. It does describe the business or nature of even well-known entities, writing, for example, "[[Goldman Sachs]], an investment bank".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2008/02/21/a-bank-by-any-other-name|title=A bank by any other name|date=2008-02-21|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-08-27|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> ''The Economist'' is known for its extensive use of [[word play]], including puns, allusions, and metaphors, as well as alliteration and assonance, especially in its headlines and captions.

===Editorial anonymity===
[[File:The Economist Article.jpg|thumb|''Economist'' articles typically do not carry [[byline]]s, anonymously publishing their work. |211x211px]]
Articles often take a definite editorial stance and almost never carry a [[byline]]. Not even the name of the editor is printed in the issue. It is a long-standing tradition that an editor's only signed article during their tenure is written on the occasion of their departure from the position. The author of a piece is named in certain circumstances: when notable persons are invited to contribute opinion pieces; when journalists of ''The Economist'' compile special reports (previously known as surveys); for the Year in Review special edition; and to highlight a potential [[conflict of interest]] over a book review. The names of ''The Economist'' editors and correspondents can be located on the media directory pages of the website.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/mediadirectory|title=Media directory|work=The Economist|access-date=25 May 2012}}</ref> Online blog pieces are signed with the initials of the writer and authors of print stories are allowed to note their authorship from their personal web sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andreaskluth.org/2008/11/20/why-the-economist-has-no-bylines/|title=Why The Economist has no bylines |work=Andreaskluth.org|access-date=25 May 2012|date=20 November 2008 }}</ref> "This approach is not without its faults (we have four staff members with the initials 'J.P.', for example) but is the best compromise between total anonymity and full bylines, in our view", wrote one anonymous writer of ''The Economist''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/09/economist-explains-itself-1/|title=Why are The Economist's writers anonymous? |journal=The Economist|access-date=25 September 2016|date=4 September 2013 }}</ref> There are three editorial and business areas in which the anonymous ethos of the weekly has contributed to strengthening its unique identity: collective and consistent voice, talent and newsroom management, and brand strength and clarity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Arrese |first=Ángel |title=""It's Anonymous.

The editors say this is necessary because "collective voice and personality matter more than the identities of individual journalists"<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.economist.com/help/about-us|title=The Economist – About us|access-date=11 June 2012|work=The Economist|date=18 November 2010}}</ref> and reflects "a collaborative effort".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/stories/2008/04/29/1659/economist_editor_micklethwait_brings_his_global_perspective_to_the_twin_cities|title=Economist Editor Micklethwait brings his global perspective to the Twin Cities|access-date=16 September 2008|date=29 April 2008|publisher=MinnPost.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705161308/http://www.minnpost.com/stories/2008/04/29/1659/economist_editor_micklethwait_brings_his_global_perspective_to_the_twin_cities|archive-date=5 July 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In most articles, authors refer to themselves as "your correspondent" or "this reviewer". The writers of the titled opinion columns tend to refer to themselves by the title (hence, a sentence in the "Lexington" column might read "Lexington was informed...").

American author and long-time reader [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]] criticised the paper's editorial anonymity in 1991, labelling it a means to hide the youth and inexperience of those writing articles.<ref name="fallows">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/1991/10/-quot-the-economics-of-the-colonial-cringe-quot-about-the-economist-magazine-washington-post-1991/7415/|title=The Economics of the Colonial Cringe: Pseudonomics and the Sneer on the Face of The Economist|access-date=27 April 2008|work=The Washington Post|date=16 October 1991}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterhigh/2019/07/01/bestselling-author-michael-lewis-has-it-all-figured-out/|title=Bestselling Author Michael Lewis Has It All Figured Out|last=High|first=Peter|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> Although individual articles are written anonymously, there is no secrecy over who the writers are as they are listed on ''The Economist''{{'s}} website, which also provides summaries of their careers and academic qualifications.<ref>{{cite web|title=Media directory|url=http://mediadirectory.economist.com/|work=The Economist|access-date=31 December 2017}}</ref> Later, in 2009, Lewis included multiple ''Economist'' articles in his [[anthology]] about the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]], ''[[Panic: The Story of Modern Financial Insanity]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lewis|first=Michael M.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXUOASHVf_YC|title=Panic: The Story of Modern Financial Insanity|date=2009|publisher=W.

[[John Ralston Saul]] describes ''The Economist'' as a "...[newspaper] which hides the names of the journalists who write its articles in order to create the illusion that they dispense disinterested truth rather than opinion. This sales technique, reminiscent of pre-Reformation Catholicism, is not surprising in a publication named after the social science most given to wild guesses and imaginary facts presented in the guise of inevitability and exactitude. That it is the Bible of the corporate executive indicates to what extent received wisdom is the daily bread of a managerial civilization."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Doubter's Companion: A Dictionary of Aggressive Common Sense |id={{ASIN|0743236602|country=uk}} }}</ref>

==Features==
[[File:A stack of Economist papers.jpg|thumb|A stack of ''Economist'' papers, ordered by publication date, 2020. |276x276px]]
''The Economist''{{'}}s primary focus is world events, politics and business, but it also runs regular sections on science and technology as well as books and the arts. Approximately every two weeks, the publication includes an in-depth special report (previously called [[survey article|surveys]]) on a given topic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/printedition/specialreports |title=Special reports |work=The Economist |access-date=9 August 2013}}</ref> The five main categories are Countries and Regions, Business, Finance and Economics, Science, and Technology. The newspaper goes to press on Thursdays, between 6&nbsp;pm and 7&nbsp;pm GMT, and is available at newsagents in many countries the next day. It is printed at seven sites around the world.

Since July 2007, there has also been a complete audio edition of the paper available 9&nbsp;pm London time on Thursdays.<ref>{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Katie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/11/pressandpublishing.business1 |title=Economist launches audio magazine|work=The Guardian|location=London |date=11 July 2007 |access-date=21 September 2016 }}</ref> The audio version of ''The Economist'' is produced by the production company ''Talking Issues''. The company records the full text of the newspaper in [[MP3]] format, including the extra pages in the UK edition. The weekly 130 MB download is free for subscribers and available for a fee for non-subscribers.

===Letters===
''The Economist'' frequently receives letters from its readership in response to the previous week's edition. While it is known to feature letters from senior businesspeople, politicians, ambassadors, and spokespeople, the paper includes letters from typical readers as well. Well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of [[corporate social responsibility]], published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from [[Oxfam]], the [[World Food Programme]], [[United Nations Global Compact]], the Chairman of [[BT Group]], an ex-Director of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and the UK [[Institute of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/542754|title=Compilation: Full text of responses to Economist survey on Corporate Social Responsibility (January–February 2005)|work=Business & Human Rights|access-date=3 February 2007}}</ref>

In an effort to foster diversity of thought, ''The Economist'' routinely publishes letters that openly criticize the paper's articles and stance. After ''The Economist'' ran a critique of [[Amnesty International]] and human rights in general in its issue dated 24 March 2007, its letters page ran a reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8954694|title=Letters: On Amnesty International and human rights, Iraq, tax breaks 4&nbsp;April 2007|date=4 April 2007|work=The Economist|access-date=9 November 2007}}</ref> Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed, to comply with local [[right-of-reply]] laws without compromising editorial independence.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis T.

Letters published in the paper are typically between 150 and 200 words long and had the now-discontinued salutation 'Sir' from 1843 to 2015. In the latter year, upon the appointment of [[Zanny Minton Beddoes]], the first female editor, the salutation was dismissed; letters have since had no salutation. Previous to a change in procedure, all responses to online articles were usually published in "The Inbox".

In addition to publishing its main newspaper, [[lifestyle magazine]], and special features, ''The Economist'' also produces books with topics overlapping with that of its newspaper. The weekly also publishes a series of [[Technical communication|technical manuals]] (or guides) as an offshoot of its [[Analytic journalism|explanatory journalism]]. Some of these books serve as collections of articles and columns the paper produces.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Woe|first=Ann|url=https://www.npr.org/books/titles/138238085/the-economist-book-of-obituaries|title=The Economist Book of Obituaries|date=November 2008|isbn=978-1-57660-326-0|language=en}}</ref> Often columnists from the newspaper write technical manuals on their topic of expertise; for example, [[Philip Coggan]], a finance correspondent, authored ''The Economist Guide to Hedge Funds'' (2011).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Coggan|first=Philip|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUuKAgAAQBAJ|title=The Economist Guide to Hedge Funds|date=2011-06-30|publisher=Profile|isbn=978-1-84765-037-5|language=en}}</ref>

''The Economist'' sponsors a wide-array of writing competitions and prices throughout the year for readers.

== Data journalism ==
[[File:A_graphic_detail_of_The_Economist.jpg|thumb|The paper launched a large [[data journalism]] platform in 2015.|259x259px]]
The presence of [[data journalism]] in ''The Economist'' can be traced to<nowiki/> its founding year in 1843.

=== Indexes ===
Historically, the publication has also maintained a section of [[economic statistics]], such as employment figures, economic growth, and interest rates. These statistical publications have been found to be seen as authoritative and decisive in British society.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WVLKKSOcGYC&pg=PA88|title=Great expectations—the social sciences in Great Britain|publisher=Commission on the Social Sciences|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7658-0849-3|page=88}}</ref> ''The Economist'' also publishes a variety of rankings seeking to position [[business school]]s and [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate universities]] among each other, respectively. In 2015, they published their first ranking of U.S. universities, focusing on comparable economical advantages.

== Opinions ==
{{Main|The Economist editorial stance}}

The editorial stance of ''The Economist'' primarily revolves around [[classical liberalism|classical]], [[Social liberalism|social]], and most notably, [[economic liberalism]]. Since its founding, it has supported [[radical centrism]], favouring policies and governments that maintain [[Centrism|centrist politics]]. The newspaper typically champions [[neoliberalism]], particularly [[free market]]s, [[free trade]], [[free immigration]], [[deregulation]], and [[globalisation]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/node/17732859|title=Globalisation: The redistribution of hope|date=16 December 2010|work=The Economist|access-date=23 April 2011}}</ref> When the newspaper was founded, the term ''[[economism]]'' denoted what would today be termed "economic liberalism".

Individual contributors take diverse views. ''The Economist'' favours the support, through [[central bank]]s, of banks and other important corporations. This principle can, in a much more limited form, be traced back to [[Walter Bagehot]], the third editor of ''The Economist'', who argued that the Bank of England should support major banks that got into difficulties. [[Karl Marx]] deemed ''The Economist'' the "European organ" of "the aristocracy of finance".<ref>{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch06.htm|title=The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte|year=1852}}</ref> The newspaper has also supported liberal causes on social issues such as recognition of gay marriages,<ref>[https://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=2515389 Let them wed], cover article on 4 January 1996</ref> legalisation of drugs,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100602002643/http://www.drogasedemocracia.org/Arquivos/the-economist.pdf How to stop the drug wars], cover article on 7 March 2009.

''The Economist'' considers itself the enemy of privilege, pomposity and predictability. It has backed conservatives such as [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]]. It has supported the Americans in [[Vietnam]]. But it has also endorsed [[Harold Wilson]] and [[Bill Clinton]], and espoused a variety of liberal causes: opposing capital punishment from its earliest days, while favouring penal reform and decolonisation, as well as—more recently—gun control and gay marriage.<ref name="About us">{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/help/about-us#About_The_Economist|title=About us|access-date=21 September 2016|work=The Economist|date=18 November 2010}}</ref>}}

Sections of ''The Economist'' criticising authoritarian regimes are frequently removed from the paper by the authorities in those countries.

Issues are sometimes delayed, but not stopped or seized.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/asiaview/2010/12/censorship_india|title=Censorship in India|work=The Economist | date=7 December 2010}}</ref> On 15 June 2006, [[Iran]] banned the sale of ''The Economist'' when it published a map labelling the [[Persian Gulf]] simply as Gulf—a choice that derives its political significance from the [[Persian Gulf naming dispute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150191582529&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=Iran bans ''The Economist'' over map|access-date=31 January 2007|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] }}</ref>

In a separate incident, the government of [[Zimbabwe]] went further and imprisoned ''The Economist''{{'}}s correspondent there, [[Andrew Meldrum]]. The government charged him with violating a statute on "publishing untruth" for writing that a woman was decapitated by supporters of the ruling [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front]] party. The [[decapitation]] claim was retracted<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=2574 |title=Guardian and RFI correspondent risks two years in jail |access-date=2 April 2014 |work=[[Reporters Without Borders]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404211952/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=2574 |archive-date=4 April 2009 }}</ref> and allegedly fabricated by the woman's husband. The correspondent was later acquitted, only to receive a [[deportation]] order.

On 19 August 2013, ''The Economist'' disclosed that the Missouri Department of Corrections had censored its issue of 29 June 2013. According to the letter sent by the department, prisoners were not allowed to receive the issue because "1. it constitutes a threat to the security or discipline of the institution; 2. may facilitate or encourage criminal activity; or 3. may interfere with the rehabilitation of an offender".<ref>{{cite news|title=The Economist in prison: About that missing issue|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2013/08/economist-prison|work=The Economist|access-date=2 April 2014|date=19 August 2013}}</ref>
