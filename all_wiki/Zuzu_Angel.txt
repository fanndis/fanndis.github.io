'''Zuleika Angel Jones''' (June 5, 1921 &ndash; April 14, 1976), better known as '''Zuzu Angel''', was a Brazilian-American [[fashion designer]], who became famous for opposing the [[Brazilian military dictatorship]] after the [[forced disappearance]] of her son, Stuart. She was also the mother of journalist Hildegard Angel.<ref name="uol"/>

In 2014, the [[National Truth Commission]] created to gather and review information about crimes committed during the years of the [[CIA]] and U.S. government-backed [[Brazilian military dictatorship]], a former agent of the military repression named [[Cláudio Antônio Guerra]], confirmed the participation of agents of the security apparatus in the death of Angel.<ref>pragmatismopolitico.com.br: [http://www.pragmatismopolitico.com.br/2014/09/claudio-guerra-assassino-ditadura-militar.html Is the man who killed nearly 100 during the military dictatorship sorry?

==Life and career==
Zuzu Angel was born on June 5, 1921, in [[Curvelo]], Brazil. While still a child, she moved to [[Belo Horizonte]], later living in [[Bahia]]. Bahian culture and colors significantly influenced the style of Angel's creations. In 1947, she went to live in [[Rio de Janeiro]], then Brazil's capital city.<ref name="uol"/>

In the 1950s, Angel began her work as a seamstress, usually making clothing for close relatives. At the start of the 1970s, she opened up a store in [[Ipanema]], at the same time beginning to exhibit her clothes on American catwalks. In her fashion expositions, she always harnessed the joy and richness of the colours of Brazilian culture, making a name for herself in the fashion world of her time.<ref name="uol"/>

Angel married an American salesman, Norman Angel Jones, and on January 11, 1946, they had a son, Stuart.<ref name="TNM"/>

==Forced disappearance of Stuart Angel==
Stuart Angel was an undergraduate student at [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]]'s School of Economics when he joined the left-wing [[urban guerrilla]] group [[Revolutionary Movement 8th October]] (''Movimento Revolucionário 8 de Outubro'' – MR-8).<ref name="TNM">[http://www.torturanuncamais-rj.org.br/MDDetalhes.asp?CodMortosDesaparecidos=330 "Stuart Edgar Angel Jones"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119053730/http://www.torturanuncamais-rj.org.br/MDDetalhes.asp?CodMortosDesaparecidos=330 |date=January 19, 2013 }} {{in lang|pt}}.

Eremias Delizoicov. Retrieved July 15, 2013.</ref> He married fellow militant Sônia Maria Morais Angel Jones,<ref name="TNM"/> who would later die in the custody of the military dictatorship's political police.

Stuart was arrested in the neighborhood of Grajaú, Rio de Janeiro, near Av. 28 de Setembro, around 9 a.m. on June 14, 1971, by officers of the Air Force Information Center (''Centro de Informações da Aeronáutica'' – CISA).<ref name="TNM" /> He was then taken under custody to CISA headquarters, where he was reportedly tortured. According to political prisoner Alex Polari, who claimed to have witnessed the incident, Stuart was then tied to the back of a jeep with his mouth glued to the vehicle's [[exhaust pipe]] and dragged through the courtyard of the Air Force base, resulting in his death by asphyxiation and [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning.<ref name="uol">[http://educacao.uol.com.br/biografias/ult1789u735.jhtm "Zuzu Angel"] {{in lang|pt}}. UOL Educação. Retrieved July 15, 2013.</ref><ref name="TNM" /> His body was never found.

===Aftermath===
Alex Polari wrote a letter to Zuzu Angel explaining the circumstances of her son's death.<ref name="uol" /><ref name="TNM" /> Based on Polari's letter and other evidence, Angel reported the murder to [[Ted Kennedy]], who revealed the case during a speech at the [[United States Senate]].<ref name="TNM" /> Angel also handed to then [[Secretary of State of the United States]], [[Henry Kissinger]], a letter she wrote herself,<ref name="uol" /> a translation of Polari's letter, and a copy of the twentieth volume of the book ''History of the Brazilian Republic'' by Hélio Silva, in which Stuart's death is discussed.<ref name="TNM" /> According to Silva, among the reactions of the regime to the protests of the American-Brazilian community were the removal and subsequent retirement of Brigadier João Paulo Burnier, who Polari accused of being responsible for Stuart's death,<ref>[http://www.soaw.org/article.php?id=233 "Notorious Graduates from Brazil"]. [[School of the Americas Watch]]. Retrieved July 15, 2013.</ref> and the dismissal of then Minister of the Air Force, Márcio de Sousa Melo.<ref name="TNM" />

==Death==
Zuzu Angel was killed in a car crash on April 14, 1976.<ref name="uol"/> The suddenness of her death raised suspicions of further government involvement; the case was investigated by the [[Comissão de Mortos e Desaparecidos Políticos]] (Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances), under process number 237/96, who found many reasons to doubt the official version of events.<ref name="CNDP">{{Cite journal | title= Direito à Memória e à Verdade | publisher=Secretaria Especial de Direitos Humanos da Presidência da República | year=2007| url= http://www.presidencia.gov.br/estrutura_presidencia/sedh/.arquivos/livrodireitomemoriaeverdadeid.pdf |pages=414–6 |language=Portuguese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205093039/http://www.presidencia.gov.br/estrutura_presidencia/sedh/.arquivos/livrodireitomemoriaeverdadeid.pdf |archivedate=December 5, 2007}}</ref>

In 2014, the involvement of agents of the military repression regime in Brazil in her death was confirmed. A former agent named 
[[Cláudio Antônio Guerra]], wrote the book [[Memories of a Dirty War]], in which he details several crimes in which he participated and he also revealed details about historical events of that time, among them the [[Riocentro#1981 May Day attack|Riocentro May Day Attack]], the death of Zuzu Angel and others.

Cláudio Antônio Guerra, who was director of the [[Department of Political and Social Order]], known as [[DOPS]], a department notorious for the involvement in torture, extrajudicial killings and [[forced disappearance]], pointed out to the presence at the scene of the accident at the moment it occurred of army Colonel [[Freddie Perdigão]], a repression agent and known torturer. In a photo taken at the scene of the accident that killed the stylist, Freddie Perdigão is seen standing close to the car as if a passer-by. The photo had been taken on April 14, 1976 and was published by the press on the day of disaster but Perdigão had not been identified in the photo until Guerra identified him to the members of the Commission.<ref>Jornal O Globo: [http://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/comissao-da-verdade-diz-que-foto-comprova-envolvimento-de-militares-na-morte-de-zuzu-angel-13377336 Truth Commission says photo proof of military involvement in the death of Zuzu Angel (in portugues-Comissão da Verdade diz que foto comprova envolvimento de militares na morte de Zuzu Angel) - Jornal O Globo], accessdate: 5/8/2015</ref>

In 2006, the events surrounding Stuart's death were dramatised in the film ''[[Zuzu Angel (film)|Zuzu Angel]]'', directed by [[Sérgio Rezende]]. The movie, in which [[Daniel de Oliveira (actor)|Daniel de Oliveira]] plays Stuart, is about Zuzu's struggle to find out the truth of her son's death.<ref name="ES">Leite, Paulo Moreira.{{cite web|url=http://blog.estadao.com.br/blog/paulo/?title=zuzu_angel_ate_parece_novela_mas_e_um_gr&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 |title=Zuzu Angel até parece novela mas é um bom filme |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614004342/http://blog.estadao.com.br/blog/paulo/?title=zuzu_angel_ate_parece_novela_mas_e_um_gr&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 |archivedate=June 14, 2007 |language=pt}}.
