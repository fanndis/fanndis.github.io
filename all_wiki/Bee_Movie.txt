==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->
An [[Idealism|idealistic]] honey bee named Barry B. Benson has recently graduated from college and is about to enter the hive's Honex Industries honey-making workforce with his best friend Adam Flayman. Barry is initially excited to join the workforce, but his ambitious, [[Insubordination|insubordinate]] attitude emerges upon discovering that his choice of job will never change once picked. Later, the two bees run into a group of Pollen Jocks, bees who collect pollen from flowers outside the hive, and they take Barry and accepts. While on his first pollen-gathering expedition in New York City, Barry gets lost in the rain, and ends up on the balcony of a human florist named Vanessa. Upon noticing Barry, Vanessa's boyfriend Ken attempts to squash him, but Vanessa gently catches and releases Barry outside the window, saving his life.

Barry later returns to express his gratitude to Vanessa, breaking the sacred rule that bees are not supposed to communicate with humans. Barry and Vanessa develop a close friendship, bordering on attraction, and spend time together. While they walk through inside the grocery, Barry is shocked to discover that the humans have stolen and eating the bees' honey for centuries, and he decides to journey to Honey Farms, which supplies the grocery store with its honey. Incredulous at the poor treatment of the bees in the hive, including the use of bee smokers to incapacitate the colony, Barry decides to sue the human race to put an end to the exploitation of bees.

Barry's mission attracts wide attention from bees and humans alike, and hundreds of people show up to watch the trial. Although Barry is up against tough defense attorney Layton T. Montgomery the trial's first day goes well. That evening, Barry is having dinner with Vanessa when Ken shows up. Vanessa leaves the room, and Ken expresses to Barry that he hates the pair spending time together. When Barry leaves to use the restroom, Ken ambushes Barry and attempts to kill him, only for Vanessa to intervene and break up with Ken. The next day at the trial, Montgomery unleashes an unrepentant [[character assassination]] against the bees leading a deeply offended Adam to sting him; Montgomery immediately exaggerates the stinging to make himself seem the victim of an assault while simultaneously tarnishing Adam. Adam's actions jeopardize the bees' credibility and put his life in danger, though he manages to recover. The other day, Barry wins the trial by exposing the jury to the torturous treatment bees are subjected to, particularly the smoker, and humans are banned from stealing honey from bees ever again.

Having lost the trial, Montgomery cryptically warns Barry that a negative shift in the balance of nature is imminent. As it turns out, Honex Industries stops honey production and puts every bee out of a job, including the vitally important Pollen Jocks, resulting all the world's plant life slowly begins to die out, without pollinating them. Before long, the last remaining flowers on Earth are being stockpiled in [[Pasadena, California]], intent for the last [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]. Barry and Vanessa travel to the parade and steal its float, which they load into a plane to be delivered to the bees so they can re-pollinate the world's flowers. When the plane's pilot and co-pilot are knocked unconscious, Vanessa is forced to land the plane, with help from Barry and the bees from Barry's hive.

Armed with the pollen of the last flowers, Barry and the Pollen Jocks manage to reverse the damage and save the world's flowers, restarting the bees' honey production,  with Barry becomes a member of the Pollen Jocks, and they fly off to a flower patch. Meanwhile, Barry and Vanessa now runs a law firm at her flower shop, titled "Insects at Law", which handles disputes between animals and humans, and certain brands of honey are now "bee-approved".

===Trailers===
Two teaser trailers were released for the film that feature Seinfeld dressed in a bee costume, trying to shoot the film in [[live-action]]. [[Eddie Izzard]] portrays the direction agent, and [[Steven Spielberg]] suggests to Seinfeld in the second trailer to just do it as a [[cartoon]]. Upon the release of the first trailer, it was announced that three of the live-action teasers would be released in total.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://trailers.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/beemovie/trailer1_large.html |title=Bee Movie - Teaser 1 - Large |website=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |access-date=July 2, 2013 |archive-date=October 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011052328/http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/beemovie/trailer1_large.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In the second trailer, Steven Spielberg is taking a picture of himself and an [[assistant director]], referencing the camera gag [[Ellen DeGeneres]] pulled on him during the [[79th Academy Awards]]. After Seinfeld fails to do scenes in live-action, Spielberg suggests Seinfeld that the film can just be made as a cartoon. One of the crew members announces that the film is a cartoon, having the crew leave the stage studio. The trailer finally shows the movie as an animated CGI feature. Also in the second trailer, the bear that jumps out at Barry is Vincent the Bear from ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', another [[DreamWorks Animation SKG]] movie.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/bee-movie-trailer-2-revealed/ |title=Bee Movie Trailer #2 Revealed &#124; /Film |publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=February 15, 2007 |accessdate=July 2, 2013 |archive-date=September 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912012231/http://www.slashfilm.com/bee-movie-trailer-2-revealed/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=AVBeeFacts>{{cite web|last1=Ziebarth|first1=Christian|title=Bee Movie Fun Facts|url=http://animatedviews.com/2007/bee-movie-fun-facts/|publisher=Animated Views|accessdate=September 11, 2014|date=September 14, 2007|quote=Vincent the bear from Over the Hedge appears in both a trailer for Bee Movie and in the courtroom scene in the film.|archive-date=November 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108102115/http://animatedviews.com/2007/bee-movie-fun-facts/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Lawsuits==

===Beebylon vs. DreamWorks===
''Bee Movie'' is alleged to be similar to a concept developed in 2000 by a team of Swedish animation students, which they claim was presented to DreamWorks in 2001 under the name ''Beebylon''. The animation students say DreamWorks rejected the idea, on the basis of it being "too childish". When ''Bee Movie'' was announced in 2003, the students claim they once again contacted DreamWorks to make sure the movie was not similar to their original concept, and were given a reassuring answer. When one of the members of the ''Beebylon'' team saw a trailer of the movie in 2007, he found it to be extremely similar and attempted to find a U.S. lawyer who could represent them. [[Jerry Seinfeld]] rejected the plagiarism claims during his PR tour for ''Bee Movie'' in Sweden. "I'm doing my best not to laugh and I'm taking it as serious as I can. But it's a little bit hard. It is entirely possible that somebody else came up with an idea about making a movie about bees. I knew nothing of this until this very morning and I hope they are not too upset."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.svd.se/seinfelds-skamt-blev-film |title=Seinfelds skämt blev film |work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |publisher=[[Schibsted]] |access-date=March 18, 2008 |quote=Jag försöker att inte skratta och tar det så allvarligt jag kan.

There have been some attempts to explain the phenomenon: Jason Richards, whom ''Vanity Fair'' identified as one of the larger promoters of the meme via his @Seinfeld2000 [[Twitter]] handle has noted the "off-brand [[Pixar]] quality" as a possible reason,<ref name=Beemovievanity/> while Barry Marder, one of the film's script writers, identified "that odd relationship between an insect and a human woman," as the possible cause.<ref name="Statemenmeme">{{cite web|last=Tait|first=Amelia|title=A decade on, Bee Movie's creators reflect on its many memes|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2017/12/why-is-bee-movie-a-meme|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=December 14, 2017|access-date=December 16, 2017|archive-date=December 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216201139/https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2017/12/why-is-bee-movie-a-meme|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] meanwhile writes that the film's internet popularity "was a reaction not just to the movie itself but to the realization among millennials that they’d been shown a truly odd movie as children and thought nothing of it." <ref>{{cite web|last=Bergado|first=Gabe|title=How Barry B.

Writing for [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]], Paris Martineau identified the meme as starting on [[Tumblr]] circa 2011 at which point users would, apparently in earnest, post the opening quotation identifying it as inspiring.<ref name="NYmag">{{cite web|last1=Martineau|first1=Paris|title=A Complete History of ''Bee Movie'''s Many, Many Memes|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/11/a-complete-history-of-bee-movies-many-many-memes.html|work=[[New York (magazine)|Select All]]|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=November 2, 2017|accessdate=December 23, 2017|archive-date=December 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223102210/http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/11/a-complete-history-of-bee-movies-many-many-memes.html|url-status=live}}</ref> By December 2012, however these posts became so ubiquitous that it would inspire parodies.<ref name="NYmag"/> It has also been suggested that the spread of videos such as ''The entire bee movie but every time they say bee it gets faster'' was inspired by the preceding popularity of the "[[We Are Number One]]" meme videos, many of which used a similar title format of "We Are Number One but...".<ref name=nymag />

Seinfeld said that he has no interest to make a sequel to ''Bee Movie'' in the wake of its online popularity. During a [[Reddit AMA]] in June 2016, a fan asked if a ''Bee Movie 2'' would happen. Seinfeld had this to say, 
{{quote|text=I considered it this spring for a solid six hours. There’s a fantastic energy now for some reason, on the internet particularly. [[Tumblr]], people brought my attention to. I actually did consider it, but then I realized it would make ''Bee Movie 1'' less iconic. But my kids want me to do it, a lot of people want me to do it. A lot of people that don’t know what animation is want me to do it. If you have any idea what animation is, you’d never do it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/jerry-seinfeld-wont-make-bee-movie-sequel-not-reason-might-think-141071.html|website=[[Cartoon Brew]]|accessdate=March 15, 2018|title=Jerry Seinfeld Won't Make A 'Bee Movie' Sequel, But Not For The Reason You Might Think|date=June 27, 2016|last=Amidi|first=Amid|archive-date=March 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315133818/https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/jerry-seinfeld-wont-make-bee-movie-sequel-not-reason-might-think-141071.html|url-status=live}}</ref>}}
