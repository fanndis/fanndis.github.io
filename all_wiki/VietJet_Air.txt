'''VietJet Aviation Joint Stock Company''' ({{lang-vi|Công ty Cổ phần Hàng không VietJet}}), trading as '''VietJet Air''' or '''Vietjet''', is an international [[low-cost airline]]<ref name="tuoitre-nov1111">{{cite news|url=http://tuoitre.vn/Kinh-te/467264/Hang-khong-gia-re-VietJet-Air-bay-dip-tet.html|title=Hàng không giá rẻ VietJet Air bay dịp tết|agency=Tuổi Trẻ Online|date=2011-11-30}}</ref> from [[Vietnam]]. It was the first privately owned new-age airline to be established in Vietnam, being granted its initial approval to operate by the [[Ministry of Finance (Vietnam)|Vietnamese Minister of Finance]] in November 2007.<ref name=forbes>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/11/30/afx4389933.html | work = Forbes |title=Vietnamese government approves country's first privately owned airline |date =30 November 2007}}</ref> As of its launch in December 2011, it became the second private airline to offer domestic service in Vietnam, as well as the fifth airline overall to offer civil domestic flights. VietJet Air is owned by Sovico Holdings, HDBank, other organisational investors, and individual stakeholders.

The carrier's launch was beset by long delays attributed to various causes, such as a [[Late-2000s financial crisis|global economic slowdown]] and regulatory issues. Although budget carrier [[AirAsia]] announced in February 2010 that it planned to purchase a 30% stake in the airline through a [[joint venture]] agreement, the carrier later rescinded its plans, citing "a failure to obtain Vietnamese regulatory approvals".<ref name="afp-oct2011">{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hP4AT8rcbxSzByHOAOWeRtSSoBRA?docId=CNG.a53db9560f7a409342b40008d5374f7a.231|title=AirAsia calls off Vietnam joint venture|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=2011-10-12}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/252058/vietjet-air-airasia-launch-lowcost-airline]  {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120907003605/http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/252058/vietjet-air-airasia-launch-lowcost-airline |date=2012-09-07 }}</ref> Despite the setbacks, VietJet Air's first flight was operated on 25 December 2011, flying from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi.<ref name="vef-nov2911">{{cite news|url=http://vef.vn/2011-11-29-vietjet-air-chinh-thuc-cat-canh-tu-25-12|title=Kinh tế 24h VietJet Air chính thức cất cánh từ 25/12|agency=Vietnam Economic Forum|date=2011-11-29}}</ref><ref name="vna-nov3011">{{cite news|url=http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/Economy/218185/VietJet-Air-to-take-off-next-month.html|title=VietJet Air to take off next month|date=2011-11-30|agency=Vietnam News Service|accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref> The carrier carried its 10 millionth passenger in December 2014,<ref name=TTO282>{{cite web|title=VietJet Air welcomes its 10 millionth passenger|url=http://www.vietjetair.com/Sites/Web/en-us/NewsDetail/news/1744/vietjet-welcomes-its-10-millionth-passenger|work=VietJet Air|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref> and the 25 millionth passenger in December 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vietjet receives the 24,999,999th passenger|url=http://www.vietjetair.com/Sites/Web/en-US/NewsDetail/news/2154/vietjet-receives-the-24999999th-passenger|website=VietJetAir.com|publisher=VietJet Air|accessdate=23 December 2015}}</ref>

==History==
===Foundation delays===
The airline has its head office in the Vạn Phúc Diplomatic Corps in [[Ba Đình District|Ba Đình]], Hanoi<ref>"[http://www.vietjetair.com]." "VIETJET AVIATION JOINT STOCK COMPANY, Head office: Block 1, Apartment 2C, Van Phuc Diplomatic Corps, Ngoc Khanh Ward, Ba Dinh District, Ha Noi, Viet Nam"</ref> It was the first privately owned airline to be established in Vietnam,<ref name="forbes"/> and as of its launch in December 2011, it became the second private airline (after [[Air Mekong]]) to offer domestic service in Vietnam, as well as the fifth airline overall not counting [[Indochina Airlines]], which ceased operations in November 2009 to offer civil domestic flights, after [[Vietnam Airlines]], [[Jetstar Pacific Airlines]], Air Mekong and the [[Vietnam Air Service Company|Vietnam Air Service Company (VASCO)]].<ref name="tuoitre-nov1111" /> In its initial plan, the [[Hanoi]]-based airline stated its intention to offer flights to [[Ho Chi Minh City]] and [[Da Nang]], gradually expanding its network to include other Asian destinations, such as Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore, and cities in [[South China|southern China]].<ref name=VJwebsite>{{cite web | url=http://www.vietjetair.com/FAQs |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107031133/http://www.vietjetair.com/FAQs|title=VietJet website: FAQ|archive-date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2020-01-10}}</ref> The airline's president and CEO is [[Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao]] from December 2011.<ref name=VietnamNet>{{cite web|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/biz/2008/05/781870/ |title=Foreign boss leads Vietnam’s first private airline}}</ref>

Initially, VietJet had shown the intention to commence flights in late 2008 or early 2009.<ref name=VJwebsite /> Throughout the next few years, the expected launch date was repeatedly pushed back, first to late 2009, then mid-2010.<ref name="VJmar09">[http://vietjetair.com/VIETJET%20AIR%20to%20launch%20the%20first%20flight%20in%20Quarter%20IV.html VIETJET AIR to launch the first flight in Quarter IV] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901132416/http://vietjetair.com/VIETJET%20AIR%20to%20launch%20the%20first%20flight%20in%20Quarter%20IV.html |date=2011-09-01 }}. March 10, 2009. VietJet Air.</ref> Airline officials gave different reasons for the delays, including increased fuel prices and other financial problems. Later news reports from the state-controlled [[Vietnam News Agency]] echoed these initial reports, stating that "the airline's four-year delay in takeoff was due to the global economic crisis", referring to the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|late-2000s global financial crisis]].<ref name="vna-nov3011" />

In February 2010, Southeast Asian [[low-cost carrier]] [[AirAsia]] announced that it had purchased a 30% stake in the airline.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/02/11/338286/airasia-buying-30-of-vietjet.html|title=AirAsia buying 30% of VietJet|author=Leithen Francis|date=2010-02-11|accessdate=2010-05-28|publisher=Flightglobal|agency=Air Transport Intelligence news}}</ref> By mid-2010, a date of October 2010 was being given for the maiden flight, with officials stating the additional delay was due to unresolved branding conflicts with the [[Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam]] (CAAV).<ref name="tuoitre">[http://www.vietnewsonline.vn/News/Business/16662/VietJet-Air-seeks-to-delay-launch-for-5th-time.htm VietJet Air seeks to delay launch for 5th time] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320145826/http://www.vietnewsonline.vn/News/Business/16662/VietJet-Air-seeks-to-delay-launch-for-5th-time.htm |date=2012-03-20 }}. June 16, 2010. Tuoi Tre.</ref>

By February 2011, VietJet was said to be "completing final stages" prior to launch before its operation license expired in June.<ref name="valc">{{cite web|url=http://www.valc.com.vn/English/Home/News/Airlines%2Dbusiness/2011/02/41AF4942/ |title=Vietjet Air prepare to launch the first flight|publisher=Valc.com|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> In March, AirAsia reportedly indicated it might withdraw funding from VietJet if the airline was unable to resolve its branding issues before the June deadline.<ref name="vnexpress-mar3111">[http://vnexpress.net/gl/kinh-doanh/2011/03/airasia-muon-rut-von-khoi-vietjet/ AirAsia muốn rút vốn khỏi Vietjet]. VNExpress.net. March 31, 2011. {{in lang|vi}}</ref> Indeed, in October 2011, AirAsia announced it was calling off its plans to form a joint venture with VietJet, citing "a failure to obtain Vietnamese regulatory approvals", including the permission to use the AirAsia brand in the airline's commercial operations.<ref name="afp-oct2011" /> Despite the collapse of the AirAsia joint venture, VietJet announced in November that its launch plans would proceed.

===Start of operations===
The airline's maiden flight was eventually launched on 25 December 2011, flying from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi.<ref name="vna-nov3011" />

The Vietnam aviation authority fined VietJet Air US$960 in 2012 for organizing five women of candidates in a local beauty contest to perform a Hawaiian themed-dance without first gaining permission to celebrate its maiden flight to the tourist hub of Nha Trang.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/international/vietnam-airline-fined-for-in-flight-bikini-show/536945 |title=Vietnam Airline Fined for In-Flight Bikini Show |date=August 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813023037/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/international/vietnam-airline-fined-for-in-flight-bikini-show/536945 |archive-date=August 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all |access-date=August 9, 2012 }}</ref>

On 9 February 2013, the airline launches its first international flight between Ho Chi Minh City and Bangkok becoming the first Vietnamese private airline to enter the international market.

As a low-cost carrier (LCC) Vietjet does not have any direct booking capabilities with the Global Distribution Service (GDS) companies, [[Amadeus CRS]], Sabre, or [[Travelport]]. This lack of connectivity limits the ability of the airline to attract interline connecting passengers for inbound and outbound flights. The problem is due in part to the lack of the airline joining Iata's Vietnam BSB which regulates the IATA accredited airlines banking settlement operations in the country. To get around the issue Vietjet has utilised an interline ticketing partner, Hahn Air (HR),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hahnair.com/|title=Home - Hahn Air|accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> which allows for ticketing in more than 194 jurisdictions, but excludes ticketing in Vietnam. In August 2016 Hahn Air announced that they could provide ticketing for domestic Vietnam flights on Vietjet via the Amadeus platform, effectively locking out the other GDS systems for domestic ticketing in Vietnam.

On 11 February 2014, at the opening of that year's [[Singapore Air Show]], the airline firmed up orders with [[Airbus]] for 60 [[A320]] aircraft at a list price of $6.4 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/vietjetair-orders-63-airbus-a320s-for-major-fleet-expansion/|title=VietJetAir orders 63 Airbus A320s for major fleet expansion|author=Manila Bulletin|work=Manila Bulletin - Latest Breaking News - News Philippines|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> Previously, the airline had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with [[Airbus]] for 92 planes in the A320 family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/airbus-vietjet-idUSL5N0HK44F20130924|title=Vietnam's VietJet seen close to major Airbus order|author=Manila Bulletin|work=Manila Bulletin - Latest Breaking News - News Philippines|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>

On 17 June 2015, at the [[Paris Air Show]], Vietjet ordered six additional Airbus A321 single-aisle jets worth $682 million at list prices from Airbus to meet demand on some of its busiest routes. On 10 November 2015 at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160804213524/http://www.dubaiairshow.aero/welcome-dubai-airshow-2017 Dubai Air Show], Vietjet placed a further order for 30 A321s with Airbus. The deal reportedly includes 21 [[Airbus A320neo family|A321neo]]s along with 9 A321ceos. At the same time, the airline confirmed the leased of 10 A319s from [[Air Berlin]] with delivery from 2016 to 2017, however, the A319 order was later cancelled and the airline decided to upgrade them to the larger A321s.

On 23 May 2016 during a visit of President Obama, an order for 200 [[Boeing 737 MAX]] aeroplanes was signed with deliveries to start in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-23/boeing-wins-11-3-billion-order-for-100-planes-from-vietjet|title=Boeing Wins $11.3 Billion Order for 100 Planes From VietJet|author1=John Boudreau|author2=Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen|date=May 22, 2016 |work=Bloomberg|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref> On 6 September 2016, CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao announced an order for 20 A321 single-aisle aircraft from Airbus. The signing took place during the visit of French President Francois Hollande.

During the 2018 [[Farnborough Airshow]], Vietjet signed two MLUs, one with Boeing on July 18 consisted of 100 Boeing 737 MAXs (80 MAX 10s and 20 MAX 8s), and the other with Airbus on July 19, consisting of 50 A321 NEOs.

===Public offering===
On 28 February 2017, Vietjet completed its public listing and officially became a fully listed entity on the [[Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange]] (HOSE), making it the first airline in Vietnam to be listed on the bourse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tuoitrenews.vn/business/39801/vietjet-completes-12bn-listing-on-ho-chi-minh-city-stock-exchange|title=Vietjet completes $1.2bn listing on Ho Chi Minh City bourse|website=TuoiTreNews.vn|access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref>

The airline's market capitalization stood at $1.2 billion, accounting for 1.5 percent of HOSE's capitalization as of 15 February 2017.

With its public listing, Vietjet became the first Vietnamese firm to have completed an IPO that meets [[Regulation S|Securities Act of 1933]] standards and practices.

[[BNP Paribas]], [[Deutsche Bank]], and [[JP Morgan Chase]] were the IPO's foreign joint global consultants.

Vietjet Air was a launch customer of the [[A321neo]] in [[Southeast Asia]] with first deliveries in December 2017.

==Financials==
According to pre-audited financial statements for 2019, Vietjet's air transport revenue reached VND41,097 billion. Profit before tax of air transport rose to VND3,936 billion, an increase of 21.4% in revenue and 29.3% in profit before tax year-on-year. Accumulated revenue was VND52,059 billion and consolidated profit was VND5,010 billion. Vietjet's total assets increased to VND47,608 billion, and equity rising to VND17,661 billion, an increase of 26% year-on-year.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Vietjet is overcoming the pandemic |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1901300/how-vietjet-is-overcoming-the-pandemic?utm_campaign=enewsletter%20regular&utm_source=enewsletter_alert&utm_medium=Business |accessdate=17 April 2020 |work=Bangkok Post |date=17 April 2020 |format=Press release}}</ref>

==Accidents and incidents==

Since commencing operations, VietJet Air has only suffered from non-fatal incidents:
*On 19 June 2014, VietJet Air Flight 8861 from [[Noi Bai International Airport|Hanoi]] to [[Lien Khuong Airport|Da Lat]] mistakenly landed at [[Cam Ranh International Airport]]. The reason was revealed to be pilot error. There were two flights, one from Hanoi to Nha Trang and the other from Hanoi to Da Lat, but one of the aircraft experienced technical difficulties and the aircraft was switched to another. Everyone was informed except for the captain of the flight. Everyone involved was suspended for further investigation.

*On 16 October 2014, VietJet Air Flight 8856 departing from [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport|Ho Chi Minh City]] to [[Cam Ranh International Airport|Nha Trang]] landed on the wrong runway. The ATC repeatedly told the pilot to land on runway 02L, the pilot also repeated the messages correctly but later landed on runway 20R. The captain and the first officer were suspended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnamnet.vn/vn/kinh-doanh/may-bay-vietjetair-ha-canh-sai-duong-bang-203531.html|title=Máy bay VietJetAir hạ cánh sai đường băng|first=VietNamNet|last=News|website=VietNamNet}}</ref> 

*On 2 April 2015, a disabled passenger flying back to Hanoi from [[Da Nang International Airport|Da Nang]] was denied service by two Vietjet employees, citing "unable to move by herself" and "did not notify the ground crew at the airport in time". The carrier later had to publicly apologize to the passenger and fined each employee VND5 million.

*On 30 September 2015, VietJet Air Flight 496, an Airbus A320 (VN-A650) suffered a bird strike incident while on approach to [[Noi Bai International Airport]]. The aircraft from [[Buon Ma Thuot Airport]] landed safely on runway 07R.

*On 28 January 2018, Vietjet caused some controversy by putting models wearing bikinis on the flight bringing [[Vietnam national under-23 football team|the Vietnam U-23 football team]] home. Vietjet CEO [[Nguyễn Thị Phương Thảo]] later publicly apologized.<ref>{{Chú thích web|url=http://vietnamnet.vn/vn/thoi-su/an-toan-giao-thong/xem-xet-phat-vietjet-vu-nguoi-mau-bikini-tren-chuyen-co-cho-u23-viet-nam-426483.html|title=Vietnamnet - Xem xét phạt Vietjet vụ người mẫu bikini trên chuyên cơ chở U23}}</ref>

*On 7 September 2018, Vietjet Air Flight 1848 from Hanoi to [[Taichung]] was hit by a hailstorm, causing damage to the cockpit window.

*On 29 November 2018, VietJet Air Flight 356, a newly delivered Airbus A321NEO (VN-A653), suffered a hard landing at [[Buon Ma Thuot Airport]] after arriving from [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport]]. The aircraft lost both tires on the nose gear. Six passengers were injured. The aircraft was later grounded, pending investigation and repairs. The pilots were later fired and suspended by the Civil Aviation Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietjet-accident/vietjet-plane-makes-troubled-landing-minor-injuries-to-some-passengers-idUSKCN1NZ0JS|title=VietJet plane makes troubled landing, minor injuries to some...|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

*On 12 July 2019, VietJet Air Flight 615 from Cam Ranh to Ho Chi Minh City entered a wrong taxiway upon landing, forcing an approaching aircraft to go-around. The incident is under investigation by the Aviation Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tuoitre.vn/may-bay-di-nham-duong-lan-mot-may-bay-khac-sap-ha-canh-phai-bay-len-lai-20190712134746312.htm|title=Máy bay đi nhầm đường lăn, một máy bay khác sắp hạ cánh phải bay lên lại|publisher=Tuoi Tre|accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref>

*On 14 June 2020, VietJet Air Flight 322 from [[Phu Quoc International Airport|Phu Quoc]] to Ho Chi Minh City skidded off the runway during landing at [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport]], causing delays to other flights. Passengers on this flight were later evacuated. No one was injured.
