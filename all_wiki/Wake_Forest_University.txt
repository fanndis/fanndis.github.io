==History==
During the Baptist State Convention of 1833 at Cartledge Creek Baptist Church in [[Rockingham, North Carolina]], establishment of '''Wake Forest Institute''' was ratified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?MarkerId=K-42|title=Marker: K-42|website=Ncmarkers.com|access-date=22 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140032/http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?MarkerId=K-42|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The school was founded after the North Carolina [[Baptist]] State Convention purchased a {{convert|615|acre|km²|adj=on}} plantation from [[Calvin Jones (NC physician)|Calvin Jones]] in an area north of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] ([[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]]) called the "Forest of Wake". The new school, designed to teach both Baptist ministers and laymen, opened on February 3, 1834, as the '''Wake Forest Manual Labor Institute'''. Students and staff were required to spend half of each day doing manual labor on its plantation. Samuel Wait, a Baptist minister, was selected as the principal, later president, of the institute.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wfu.edu/history/HST_WFU/perry.html |title=History of Wake Forest University |website=Wfu.edu |access-date=2013-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214225258/http://www.wfu.edu/history/HST_WFU/perry.html |archive-date=2013-12-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Wake Forest College===
[[File:UpperQuad ACB.jpg|right|thumb|Wait Chapel, located on the Hearn Plaza (or the Upper Quad)]]
In 1838, the school was renamed '''Wake Forest College''', and the manual labor system was abandoned. The town that grew up around the college came to be called the town of [[Wake Forest, North Carolina|Wake Forest]]. In 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], the school closed due to the loss of most students and some faculty to service in the [[Confederate States Army]]. The college re-opened in 1866 and prospered over the next four decades under the leadership of presidents [[Washington Manly Wingate]], Thomas H. Pritchard, and Charles Taylor. In 1894, the School of Law was established, followed by the School of Medicine in 1902. The university held its first summer session in 1921. [[Lea Laboratory]] was built in 1887–1888, and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>

The leading college figure in the early 20th century was [[William L. Poteat]], a gifted [[biology|biologist]] and the first layman to be elected president in the college's history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.journalnow.com/news/local/advocate-wake-forest-president-embraced-eugenics-movement/article_7f82bba2-8fea-11e2-aa34-0019bb30f31a.html|title=Advocate: Wake Forest president embraced eugenics movement|last=Railey|first=John|date=December 9, 2002|website=journalnow.com|publisher=Winston-Salem Journal|access-date=March 10, 2020}}</ref> "Dr. Billy" continued to promote growth, hired many outstanding professors, and expanded the [[science]] curriculum. He also stirred upheaval among North Carolina Baptists with his strong support of teaching the theory of [[evolution]] but eventually won formal support from the Baptist State Convention for academic freedom at the college.

===Move to Winston-Salem===
[[File:BensonCenter ACB.jpg|thumb|left|The Benson University Center]]
The School of Medicine moved to [[Winston-Salem]] (then North Carolina's second-largest city) in 1941 under the supervision of Dean [[Coy Cornelius Carpenter]], who guided the school through the transition from a two-year to a four-year program. The school then became the [[Bowman Gray]] School of Medicine. The following year, 1942, Wake Forest admitted its first female undergraduate students, after [[World War II]] dramatically depleted the pool of male students.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

In 1946, as a result of large gifts from the [[Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation]], the entire college agreed to move to Winston-Salem, a move that was completed for the beginning of the fall 1956 term, under the leadership of Harold W. Tribble. Charles and [[Mary Reynolds Babcock]] (daughter of [[R.&nbsp;J. Reynolds]]) donated to the college about {{convert|350|acre|km²|1}} of fields and woods at "Reynolda", their estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalnow.com/servlet/Satellite|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030801080345/http://www.journalnow.com/servlet/Satellite|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 August 2003|title=Winston-Salem Journal|access-date=16 October 2014}}</ref> From 1952 to 1956, fourteen new buildings were constructed on the new campus.<ref name="autogenerated1">The Undergraduate Schools: Bulletin of Wake Forest University 2007–2008</ref> These buildings were constructed in [[Georgian (architecture)|Georgian]] style.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The old campus in Wake Forest was sold to the Baptist State Convention to establish the [[Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary]].

===Desegregation===
On April 27, 1962, Wake Forest's board of trustees voted to accept Edward Reynolds, a native of the African nation of [[Ghana]], as the first black full-time undergraduate at the school. This made Wake Forest the first major private university in the South to desegregate.<ref name=facesofcourage>{{cite web|title=Faces of Courage|url=http://facesofcourage.wfu.edu/|publisher=Wake Forest University|access-date=29 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827194810/http://facesofcourage.wfu.edu/|archive-date=27 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Reynolds, a transfer student from [[Shaw University]], later became the first black graduate of the university in 1964, when he earned a bachelor's degree in history. Later, he went on to earn master's degrees at [[Ohio University]] and [[Yale Divinity School]], and a PhD in African history from the [[University of London]]. He became a professor of history at the [[University of California, San Diego]], and author of several history books.<ref name=deseg>{{cite news|last1=Brinson|first1=Linda Carter|title=Edward Reynolds: The Courage to Change a Campus|url=http://facesofcourage.wfu.edu/|access-date=29 August 2015|work=Wake Forest Magazine|issue=2|publisher=Wake Forest University|date=Spring 2013|volume=60|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827194810/http://facesofcourage.wfu.edu/|archive-date=27 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Recent history===

A graduate studies program was inaugurated in 1961, and in 1967 the school became the fully accredited Wake Forest University.

In order to graduate, a Wake Forest student must finish three requirements for 120 hours of credit: a core set of classes, a course of study related to a major, and electives. The core set of classes includes basic requirements (a first-year seminar, a writing seminar, health and PE classes, and foreign language literature) and divisional requirements (at least two classes in each of the humanities, social sciences and math/natural sciences and at least one in the fine arts and literatures).<ref>{{cite book|title=Bulletin of the Undergraduate Schools 2013–2014|year=2013|publisher=Wake Forest University|pages=64–66|url=http://static.wfu.edu/files/pdf/academics/ugb2013-2014.pdf|access-date=2013-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711205252/http://static.wfu.edu/files/pdf/academics/ugb2013-2014.pdf|archive-date=2013-07-11|url-status=live}}</ref>

Wake Forest also offers an "Open Curriculum" option, in which a small number of students, approved by a committee, may design a course of study with an adviser that follows a liberal arts framework but does not necessarily fulfill all the core degree requirements.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bulletin of the Undergraduate Schools 2013–2014|year=2013|publisher=Wake Forest University|page=59|url=http://static.wfu.edu/files/pdf/academics/ugb2013-2014.pdf|access-date=2013-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711205252/http://static.wfu.edu/files/pdf/academics/ugb2013-2014.pdf|archive-date=2013-07-11|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Fraternities and sororities===
With 25 chapters, fraternity and sorority membership consists of around 45 percent of the student population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://parents.wfu.edu/faq/#greeklife |title=Questions & Answers &#124; Parents &#124; Wake Forest University |website=Parents.wfu.edu |date=2013-05-21 |access-date=2013-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829214814/http://parents.wfu.edu/faq/#greeklife |archive-date=2013-08-29 |url-status=live }}</ref> Wake Forest requires that all new members of fraternities and sororities complete at least one semester of full-time studies, so the primary recruiting time is during the spring semester.

Most fraternities and sororities have lounges in campus residence halls, with surrounding rooms being reserved for the chapter. One fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon, has a residence off campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ada-nc.com/portfolio/wake-forest-university-dke-house/ |title=Wake Forest University DKE House &#124; Architectural Design Associates |website=Ada-nc.com |access-date=2013-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421053040/http://ada-nc.com/portfolio/wake-forest-university-dke-house/ |archive-date=2014-04-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Student government===
Founded in 1923, Wake Forest Student Government (known as SG) works under a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-Presidential system]]. Four executive officers (student body president, speaker of the House, secretary and treasurer) are elected each spring. The president appoints a chief of staff. The executive officers coordinate with the Cabinet, formed by the co-chairs of the six standing committees. The executive committee and Cabinet work with members of the General Assembly to pass legislation and advocate on behalf of students.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://sg.wfu.edu/history/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130410000136/http://sg.wfu.edu/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 April 2013|work=Wake Forest University Student Government|access-date=8 March 2013}}</ref>

The Senate, which acts as a student legislature, is made up of about 48 senators, chosen in fall and spring elections each year. The legislators are assigned to one of six committees focused on an area of student needs. The student trustee is an ex-officio member of Student Government and acts as a liaison between the [[board of trustees]] and Student Government.

===Personal and career development===
In 2009, President Nathan Hatch outlined in his strategic plan a campus culture in which personal and career development would become an integral component of the undergraduate student experience.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Collegiate University: The Liberal Arts and The Professions|url=http://strategicplan.wfu.edu/whitepaper3.html|publisher=Wake Forest University|access-date=11 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012020209/http://strategicplan.wfu.edu/whitepaper3.html|archive-date=12 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Later that year, he created a cabinet-level position and appointed Andy Chan as the vice president for personal and career development.<ref>{{cite news|title=Finished College.

[[File:WakeForestRolledQuad.jpg|thumb|"Rolling the Quad" is a WFU tradition that is done after major victories in athletic competition.]]
[[File:DemonDeaconACB.jpg|right|thumb|Wake Forest University mascot Demon Deacon]]

Originally, Wake Forest's athletic teams were known as The Old Gold and Black or the Baptists, due to its association with the Baptist Convention (from which it later separated itself). However, in 1923, after a particularly impressive win against the [[Duke Blue Devils]], a newspaper reporter wrote that the Deacons "fought like Demons", giving rise to the current team name, the "'''[[Demon Deacon]]s'''."

Wake Forest has won a total of nine national championships in five different sports. Wake Forest is sometimes referred to as being a part of "[[Tobacco Road rivalry|Tobacco Road]]" or "The Big Four", terms that refer to the four North Carolina schools that compete heatedly against each other within the ACC; these include [[Duke University|Duke]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]], and [[North Carolina State]], as well as Wake Forest.

The Wake Forest Demon Deacons participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] (in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision|Bowl Subdivision]] for [[college football|football]]) and in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, and track & field; women's sports include, basketball, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track & field, and volleyball.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://godeacs.com|title=Wake Forest University Athletics - Official Website|work=www.godeacs.com|access-date=May 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506132716/https://godeacs.com/|archive-date=May 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Screamin' Demons===
Student attendance of [[Wake Forest Football]] and [[Basketball]] games is high, in part due to the program known as "Screamin' Demons." At the beginning of each respective athletic season students on the Reynolda Campus can sign up for the program whereby they pay $40 for each year; in addition to the best seats at the games, this gets students a football shirt in the fall and a tie-dye T-shirt in the spring along with a card that serves as an automatic pass to the sporting events. They lose this privilege if they miss two of the games. Through the planning of Sports Marketing and the Screamin' Demons program, basketball game seats in the students section are difficult to attain without participating in the Screamin' Demons program. The arena can seat only 2,250 of the 4,500 undergraduate students at Wake Forest. At least 150 seats are always set aside for non-Screamin Demons, who sit behind the 2,100 member group.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://godeacs.com/sports/2018/7/27/screamindemons.aspx|title=Screamin' Deacons – Wake Forest University|work=www.godeacs.com|access-date=June 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606025217/https://godeacs.com/sports/2018/7/27/screamindemons.aspx|archive-date=June 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Special interest organizations range from the academic, such the [[Model United Nations]] team, to the artistic, such as the [[handbell]] choir. In spring of 2006, the [[Mock Trial]] team was notable in qualifying for the national tournament while only in its 2nd year in operation. Religious organizations are also numerous.

Historic student organizations such as the Philomathesians, an artistic literary magazine, are also present. Students are entertained by numerous performing groups, including [[The Lilting Banshees]] Comedy Troupe, The Living Parables Christian Drama Troupe, and The Anthony Aston Players.

There are about sixty cadets in the program, and about half of each military science class finishes Leadership Development Advanced Camp ([[Leader Development and Assessment Course|LDAC]]) as a "Distinguished Military Graduate", the top 20 percent of ROTC graduates.

The minimum service commitment of a contracted cadet who graduates from ROTC is four years active duty and four years of inactive reserve duty after that. Alternatively, a cadet can choose to forgo active duty service and serve eight straight years in the active Reserve or National Guard. Other alternative service plans are available for those who intend to be an army doctor, lawyer, or chaplain with source of commissioning via ROTC.

At Wake Forest contracted ROTC cadets are given full scholarship, a monthly stipend, and book money by the US Army. The university extends the scholarship with free room and board.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://financialaid.wfu.edu/merit/army-rotc-scholarships/|title=Army ROTC Scholarships|work=www.fiancialaid.wfu.edu|access-date=June 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606023652/https://financialaid.wfu.edu/merit/army-rotc-scholarships/|archive-date=June 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
