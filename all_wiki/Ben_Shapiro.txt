In his first book ''Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America's Youth'' (2004), Shapiro argues that students are not exposed to a variety of viewpoints at universities and that those who do not have strong opinions will be overwhelmed by an atmosphere dominated by liberal instructors even if discussion is encouraged in classrooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailybruin.com/2004/05/10/book-misconstrues-facts/|title=Book misconstrues facts|last=Hsu|first=Charlotte|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604042643/http://dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/articles.asp?id=28928|archive-date=June 4, 2004|work=[[The Daily Bruin]]|publisher=UCLA|date=May 10, 2004|access-date=June 10, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2011, HarperCollins published Shapiro's fourth book, ''[[Primetime Propaganda|Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV]]'', in which Shapiro argues that Hollywood has a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] agenda that it actively promotes through prime-time entertainment programming. In the book, the producers of ''[[Happy Days]]'' and ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' say they pursued a pro-pacifist, anti-Vietnam-War agenda in those series.<ref>{{Cite news|last= Lawson|first= Mark|title= Is US TV too leftwing?|url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/29/is-us-tv-too-leftwing|newspaper= The Guardian|access-date= June 29, 2011|date= June 29, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130930113043/http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/29/is-us-tv-too-leftwing|archive-date= September 30, 2013|df= mdy-all}}</ref> The same year ''Primetime Propaganda'' came out, Shapiro became a fellow at the [[David Horowitz Freedom Center]].{{cn|date=November 2020}}

=== Speaker ===
Shapiro speaks at college campuses across the United States. In his speeches, he often presents a conservative viewpoint on controversial subjects. He spoke at 37 campuses between early 2016 and late 2017.<ref name="nyt-gladiator" />

Some students and faculty members at [[California State University, Los Angeles]] objected to a speech that Shapiro, who was then an editor at Breitbart News, was scheduled to hold at the university on February 25, 2016, titled "When Diversity Becomes a Problem". University president William Covino canceled the speech three days before it was to take place, with the intention of rescheduling it so that the event could feature various viewpoints on the subject of campus diversity. Covino ultimately reversed his decision, allowing the speech to go on as planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ktla.com/2016/02/25/cal-state-l-a-cancels-event-featuring-ben-shapiro-conservative-pundit-insists-he-will-appear-on-campus-anyway/|title=In Reversal, Cal State LA President Allows Conservative Pundit Ben Shapiro to Speak at Campus Event|date=February 25, 2016|publisher=KTLA 5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226092258/http://ktla.com/2016/02/25/cal-state-l-a-cancels-event-featuring-ben-shapiro-conservative-pundit-insists-he-will-appear-on-campus-anyway/|archive-date=February 26, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/university-president-shuts-down-conservative-journalists-speech-citing-free-exchange-of-ideas/|title=University President Shuts Down Conservative Journalist's Speech, Citing "Free Exchange of Ideas"|publisher=Mediaite|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228024612/http://www.mediaite.com/online/university-president-shuts-down-conservative-journalists-speech-citing-free-exchange-of-ideas/|archive-date=February 28, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The day of the speech, student protesters formed human chains, blocking the doors to the event, and staging sit-in protests.
