'''Edward Joseph Snowden''' (born June 21, 1983) is an American [[whistleblower]] who copied and leaked [[Classified information in the United States|highly classified information]] from the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) in 2013 when he was a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) employee and subcontractor. [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|His disclosures]] revealed numerous [[global surveillance]] programs, many run by the NSA and the [[Five Eyes|Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance]] with the cooperation of [[Telephone company|telecommunication companies]] and European governments, and prompted a [[Reactions to global surveillance disclosures|cultural discussion]] about [[national security]] and individual privacy.

In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], after previous employment with [[Dell]] and the CIA.<ref name="VanityFair">{{cite news |first1=Bryan |last1=Burrough |first2=Sarah |last2=Ellison |first3=Suzanna |last3=Andrews |title=The Snowden Saga: A Shadowland of Secrets and Light |date=April 23, 2014 |access-date=April 29, 2016 |website=Vanity Fair |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2014/05/edward-snowden-politics-interview }}</ref> Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to [[Hong Kong]] after leaving his job at an [[Hawaii Cryptologic Center|NSA facility in Hawaii]], and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists [[Glenn Greenwald]], [[Laura Poitras]], [[Barton Gellman]], and [[Ewen MacAskill]]. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and other publications.

On June 21, 2013, the [[United States Department of Justice]] unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and theft of government property,<ref name="wapocharges" /> following which the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] revoked his [[United States passport|passport]].<ref name="KerryPassport" /> Two days later, he flew into [[Moscow]]'s [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]], where Russian authorities observed the cancelled passport, and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia later granted Snowden the [[right of asylum]] with an initial visa for residence for one year, which was subsequently repeatedly extended. In October 2020, he was granted permanent residency in Russia.<ref>{{Cite web|last=CNN|first=Mary Ilyushina|title=Edward Snowden gets permanent residency in Russia - lawyer|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/22/europe/edward-snowden-russia-residency-intl/index.html|access-date=2020-10-22|website=CNN}}</ref>

The former colleague said Snowden was given full administrator privileges with virtually unlimited access to NSA data. Snowden was offered a position on the NSA's elite team of [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]], [[Tailored Access Operations]], but turned it down to join Booz Allen.<ref name="genius among" /> An anonymous source later said that Booz Allen's hiring screeners found possible discrepancies in Snowden's resume but still decided to hire him.<ref name="Despiteresume">{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-snowden-idUSBRE95K01J20130621 |title=Exclusive: NSA contractor hired Snowden despite concerns about resume discrepancies |work=Reuters |date=June 22, 2013 |last=Hosenball |first=Mark |access-date=October 19, 2019 }}</ref> Snowden's résumé stated that he attended computer-related classes at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. A spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins said that the university did not find records to show that Snowden attended the university, and suggested that he may instead have attended Advanced Career Technologies, a private for-profit organization that operated as the [[American Career Institute|Computer Career Institute]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref name="Despiteresume" /> The University of Maryland University College acknowledged that Snowden had attended a summer session at a UM campus in Asia. Snowden's résumé stated that he estimated that he would receive a [[University of Liverpool]] computer security master's degree in 2013. The university said that Snowden registered for an online master's degree program in computer security in 2011 but was inactive as a student and had not completed the program.<ref name="Despiteresume" />

In his May 2014 interview with NBC News, Snowden accused the U.S. government of trying to use one position here or there in his career to distract from the totality of his experience, downplaying him as a "low level analyst." In his words, he was "trained as a spy in the traditional sense of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas—pretending to work in a job that I'm not—and even being assigned a name that was not mine." He said he'd worked for the NSA undercover overseas, and for the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure "in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world. So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading."<ref name="NBCNews Motive Revealed" /> In a June interview with [[Globo TV]], Snowden reiterated that he "was actually functioning at a very senior level."<ref name=Globo /> In a July interview with ''The Guardian'', Snowden explained that, during his NSA career, "I began to move from merely overseeing these systems to actively directing their use. Many people don’t understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting."<ref name= EditedTranscript>{{cite news |last1=Rusbridger |first1=Alan |last2=MacAskill |first2=Ewen |title=Edward Snowden interview – the edited transcript |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/-sp-edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-interview-transcript |date=July 18, 2014 |access-date=April 11, 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Snowden subsequently told ''Wired'' that while at Dell in 2011, "I would sit down with the [[Chief information officer|CIO]] of the CIA, the [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] of the CIA, the chiefs of all the technical branches. They would tell me their hardest technology problems, and it was my job to come up with a way to fix them."<ref name=BamfordWired />

Of his time as an NSA analyst, directing the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment when he and his colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly<blockquote>"thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense—for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation. But they're extremely attractive. So what do they do? They turn around in their chair and they show a co-worker ... and sooner or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people."</blockquote> As Snowden observed it, this behavior happened routinely every two months but was never reported, being considered one of the "fringe benefits" of the work.<ref name=Ispy>{{cite news |last1=Rusbridger |first1=Alan |last2=MacAskill |first2=Ewen |title=I, spy: Edward Snowden in exile |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/-sp-edward-snowden-interview-rusbridger-macaskill |date=July 18, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

Self-description as a whistleblower and attribution as such in news reports does not determine whether he qualifies as a whistleblower within the meaning of the [[Whistleblower Protection Act]] of 1989 (5 USC 2303(b)(8)-(9); Pub.  Law 101-12). However, Snowden's potential status as a Whistleblower under the 1989 Act is not directly addressed in the criminal complaint against him in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] (see below) (Case No. 1:13 CR 265 (0MH)).

===Potential impact on U.S. national security===
In March 2014, Army General [[Martin Dempsey]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], told the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]], "The vast majority of the documents that Snowden ... exfiltrated from our highest levels of security ... had nothing to do with exposing government oversight of domestic activities.

The September 15, 2016 HPSCI report<ref name=hpsci-report/> estimated the number of downloaded documents at 1.5 million.

In a 2013 [[Associated Press]] interview, [[Glenn Greenwald]] stated <ref name=Greenwald-ap-2013>{{cite web | website=www.new.yahoo.com | date=July 14, 2013 | access-date=June 10, 2020 | last=Barchfield | first=Jenny | location=Rio De Janeiro | publisher=Associated Press | title=Greenwald: Snowden docs contain NSA 'blueprints' | url=http://www.news.yahoo.com/greenwald-snowden-docs-contain-nsa-blueprint-235836523.html}}</ref> {{quote | text="In order to take documents with him that proved that what he was saying was true he had to take ones that included very sensitive,  detailed blueprints of how the NSA does what they do."}}
Thus the Snowden documents allegedly contained sensitive NSA ''blueprints'' detailing how the NSA operates, and which would allow someone who read them to evade or even duplicate NSA surveillance.
Further, a July 20, 2015 New York Times article<ref name=nyt-july-2015>{{cite web | website=www.nytimes.com | date=July 20, 2015 | access-date=June 10, 2020 | publisher=New York Times | location=Washington | last1=Schmitt | first1=Eric | last2=Hubbard | first2=Ben | title=ISIS Leader Takes Steps to Ensure Group's Survival | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/world/middleeast/isis-strategies-include-lines-of-succession-and-deadly-ring-tones.html}}</ref> reported that the terror group [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] (ISIS or ISIL) had studied revelations from Snowden, about how the [[United States]] gathered information on militants, the main result is that the group's top leaders used couriers or encrypted channels to avoid being tracked or monitoring of their communications by Western analysts.

According to Snowden, he did not indiscriminately turn over documents to journalists, stating that "I carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest. There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn't turn over"<ref name="guardian-reveal"/> and that "I have to screen everything before releasing it to journalists ... If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country."<ref name="SCMPJune24" /> Despite these measures, the improper redaction of a document by the ''New York Times'' resulted in the exposure of intelligence activity against al-Qaeda.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yuhas |first1=Alan |title=John Oliver presses Edward Snowden on whether he read all leaked NSA material |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/06/edward-snowden-john-oliver-last-week-tonight-nsa-leaked-documents |newspaper=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=September 30, 2015|date=April 6, 2015 }}</ref>

In June 2014, the NSA's recently installed director, [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Michael S.

On June 14, 2015, UK's ''Sunday Times'' reported that Russian and Chinese intelligence services had decrypted more than 1 million classified files in the Snowden cache, forcing the UK's [[MI6]] intelligence agency to move agents out of live operations in hostile countries. [[Sir David Omand]], a former director of the UK's [[GCHQ]] intelligence gathering agency, described it as a huge strategic setback that was harming Britain, America, and their NATO allies.

Snowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms.<ref name="VanityFair" /> After the disclosures, his identity was made public by ''The Guardian'' at his request on June 9, 2013.<ref name="politico-journalist-spat" /> "I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded," he said.

Snowden said he wanted to "embolden others to step forward" by demonstrating that "they can win."<ref name="gellman-recount"/> He also said that the system for reporting problems did not work. "You have to report wrongdoing to those most responsible for it."

In December 2013, upon learning that a U.S. federal judge had ruled the collection of U.S. phone metadata conducted by the NSA as likely unconstitutional, Snowden said, "I acted on my belief that the NSA's mass surveillance programs would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that the American public deserved a chance to see these issues determined by open courts ... today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans' rights."<ref name=20131217Times>{{cite news |title=Federal Judge Rules Against N.S.A.

Specifically, the charges filed in the Criminal Complaint were:

* 18 U.S.C. 798(a)(3) Willful Communication of Classified Intelligence Information to an Unauthorized Person

The analysis includes the charges against Snowden, among several other cases. The discussion also covers gaps in the legal framework used to prosecute such cases.

=== Snowden response to Criminal Complaint ===
Snowden was asked in a January 2014 interview about returning to the U.S. to face the charges in court, as Obama had suggested a few days prior. Snowden explained why he rejected the request: <blockquote>What he doesn't say are that the crimes that he's charged me with are crimes that don't allow me to make my case. They don't allow me to defend myself in an open court to the public and convince a jury that what I did was to their benefit. ... So it's, I would say, illustrative that the President would choose to say someone should face the music when he knows the music is a show trial.<ref name=ARDtranscript /><ref>{{cite interview |last=Snowden |first=Edward |title=Snowden Interview In English ARD 480p |work=[[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] |access-date=October 20, 2019 |url=https://archive.org/details/SnowdenInterviewInEnglishARD480p |time=29:20 |date=February 2, 2014 }}</ref></blockquote> Snowden's legal representative, [[Jesselyn Radack]], wrote that "the Espionage Act effectively hinders a person from defending himself before a jury in an open court." She said that the "arcane World War I law" was never meant to prosecute whistleblowers, but rather spies who betrayed their trust by selling secrets to enemies for profit.

===United States===

====Barack Obama====
In response to outrage by European leaders, President [[Barack Obama]] said in early July 2013 that all nations collect intelligence, including those expressing outrage. His remarks came in response to an article in the German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.<ref>{{cite news | date=July 2, 2013 | access-date=June 12, 2020 | last1=Cohen | first1=Tom | last2=Pearson | first2=Michael | work=CNN |title=All nations collect intelligence, Obama says | url=https://www.cnn.com//2013/07/01/world/europe/eu-nsa/index.html}}</ref>

In 2014, Obama stated, "our nation's defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nation's secrets. If any individual who objects to government policy can take it into their own hands to publicly disclose classified information, then we will not be able to keep our people safe, or conduct foreign policy." He objected to the "sensational" way the leaks were reported, saying the reporting often "shed more heat than light." He went on to assert that the disclosures had revealed "methods to our adversaries that could impact our operations."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2014/01/17/263480199/transcript-of-president-obamas-speech-on-nsa-reforms |title=Transcript Of President Obama's Speech On NSA Reforms |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 17, 2014 |access-date=October 24, 2019 }}</ref>

During a November 2016 interview with the German broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and the German paper ''Der Spiegel'', then-outgoing President Obama said he "can't" pardon Edward Snowden unless he is physically submitted to US authorities on US soil.<ref name=snowden-obama-pardon>{{cite web | website=www.usnews.com | date=November 11, 2016 | access-date=June 12, 2016 | last=Nelson | first=Steven | publisher=US News and World Report |title=Obama's "Factually Incorrect" Edward Snowden Remarks: Game Over for a Pardon? | url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-11-21/obamas-factually-incorrect-edward-snoden-remarks-game-over-for-a-pardon}}</ref> As there is no such restriction specified in the US constitution, observers interpreted "can't" as "won't".

====Donald Trump====

In 2013, [[Donald Trump]] made a series of tweets in which he referred to Snowden as a "traitor", saying he gave "serious information to China and Russia" and "should be executed". Later that year he added a caveat, tweeting "if it and he could reveal Obama's [birth] records, I might become a major fan".<ref name="WaPoTrumpTweets">{{cite web |last1=Phillips |first1=Christine |title=Trump once demanded Edward Snowden's execution for giving 'serious information' to Russia |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/16/trump-once-demanded-edward-snowdens-execution-for-giving-serious-information-to-russia/ |website=WaPo |access-date=August 18, 2020}}</ref>

In August 2020, Trump said during a press conference that he would "take a look" at [[pardon]]ing Snowden, and added that he was "not that aware of the Snowden situation".<ref name="ReutersTrumpPardon">{{cite web |last=Satter |first=Raphael |title=Trump says he is considering pardon for leaker Edward Snowden |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-snowden/trump-says-hes-considering-pardon-for-leaker-edward-snowden-idUSKCN25B10Z |website=Reuters |access-date=18 August 2020}}</ref><ref name="HillTrumpPardon">{{cite web |last1=Mitchell |first1=Ellen |title=Top House Armed Services lawmakers warn against Trump pardoning Snowden |url=https://thehill.com/policy/defense/512373-top-house-armed-services-lawmakers-warn-against-trump-pardoning-snowden |website=The Hill |access-date=August 18, 2020}}</ref> He stated, "There are many, many people — it seems to be a split decision that many people think that he should be somehow treated differently, and other people think he did very bad things, and I’m going to take a very good look at it."<ref name="APBarrVehement">{{cite web |title=AP Exclusive: Barr 'vehemently opposed' to pardoning Snowden |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/ap-exclusive-barr-vehemently-opposed-pardoning-snowden-72523574 |website=ABC/AP |access-date=August 21, 2020}}</ref>

''[[Forbes]]'' described Trump's willingness to consider a pardon as "leagues away" from his 2013 views. Snowden responded to the announcement saying, "the last time we heard a White House considering a pardon was 2016, when the very same Attorney General who once charged me conceded that, on balance, my work in exposing the NSA's unconstitutional system of mass surveillance had been 'a public service'."<ref name="ForbedSnowdenTrumpRe">{{cite web |last1=Sandler |first1=Rachael |title=Trump Says He Will 'Take A Look' At Pardoning Edward Snowden |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2020/08/15/trump-says-he-will-take-a-look-at-pardoning-edward-snowden/#162eb8ef7832 |website=Forbes |access-date=August 18, 2020}}</ref> Top members of the [[House Armed Services Committee]] immediately voiced strong opposition to a pardon, saying Snowden's actions resulted in "tremendous harm" to national security, and that he needed to stand trial. [[Liz Cheney]] called the idea of a pardon "unconscionable". A week prior to the announcement, Trump also said he had been thinking of letting Snowden return to the U.S. without facing any time in jail.<ref name="HillTrumpPardon" />

Days later, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[William Barr]] told the [[Associated Press|AP]] he was "vehemently opposed" to the idea of a pardon, saying "[Snowden] was a traitor and the information he provided our adversaries greatly hurt the safety of the American people, he was peddling it around like a commercial merchant. We can’t tolerate that."<ref name="APBarrVehement" />

====Public figures====
''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' leaker [[Daniel Ellsberg]] called Snowden's release of NSA material the most significant leak in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/10/edward-snowden-daniel-ellsberg-whistleblower-history_n_3413545.html |title=Daniel Ellsberg Calls Edward Snowden A 'Hero,' Says NSA Leak Was Most Important in American History |work=Huffington Post |first=Jack |last=Mirkinson |date=June 10, 2013 |access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name="ellsbergstasi">{{cite news |last=Ellsberg |first=Daniel |title=Edward Snowden: saving us from the United Stasi of America |work=The Guardian |date=June 10, 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/10/edward-snowden-united-stasi-america |location=London}}</ref> Shortly before the September 2016 release of his biographical thriller film ''[[Snowden (film)|Snowden]],'' based on the semi-fictionalized life of Edward Snowden with a short appearance by Snowden himself, [[Oliver Stone]] said that Snowden should be pardoned, calling him a "patriot above all" and suggesting that he should run the NSA himself.<ref name="wendy-mesley">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueczcri7IJs |title=Oliver Stone on Edward Snowden and privacy rights |first=Wendy |last=Mesley |series=[[The National (TV program)|The National]] |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=September 11, 2016}}</ref>

In a December 18, 2013 CNN editorial, former NSA whistleblower [[Trailblazer Project|J.

As Clinton saw it, "turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or unintentionally—drained, gave all kinds of information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups and the like.

====Court rulings (United States)====
On June 6, 2013, in the wake of Snowden's leaks, conservative public interest lawyer and [[Judicial Watch]] founder [[Larry Klayman]] filed a lawsuit claiming that the federal government had unlawfully collected metadata for his telephone calls and was harassing him. In ''[[Klayman v. Obama]]'', Judge [[Richard J. Leon]] referred to the NSA's "almost-Orwellian technology" and ruled the bulk telephone metadata program to be likely unconstitutional.<ref name=WaPoUnconstitutional>{{cite news |last=Nakashima |first=Ellen |title=Judge: NSA's collecting of phone records is probably unconstitutional |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-nsas-collecting-of-phone-records-is-likely-unconstitutional/2013/12/16/6e098eda-6688-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c_story.html |work=The Washington Post |access-date=March 13, 2014 |date=December 17, 2013}}</ref>
Leon's ruling was stayed pending an appeal by the government.
Snowden later described Judge Leon's decision as vindication.<ref name=PoliticoPulizer>{{cite web |last=Byers |first=Dylan |title=Edward Snowden looms over Pulitzer Prizes |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/edward-snowden-pulitzer-prize-washington-post-guardian-nsa-104608 |date=March 13, 2014 |work=Politico |access-date=March 13, 2014}}</ref>

On June 11, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, alleging that the NSA's phone records program was unconstitutional. In December 2013, ten days after Judge Leon's ruling, Judge [[William H. Pauley III]] came to the opposite conclusion. In ''[[ACLU v. Clapper]]'', although acknowledging that privacy concerns are not trivial, Pauley found that the potential benefits of surveillance outweigh these considerations and ruled that the NSA's collection of phone data is legal.<ref name=NYTBulkLegal>{{cite news |last=Liptak |first=Adam |title=Judge Upholds NSA's Bulk Collection of Data on Calls |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/us/nsa-phone-surveillance-is-lawful-federal-judge-rules.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=March 13, 2014 |date=December 27, 2013}}</ref>

[[Gary Schmitt]], former staff director of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], wrote that "The two decisions have generated public confusion over the constitutionality of the NSA's data collection program—a kind of judicial 'he-said, she-said' standoff."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/a-tale-of-two-judges |first=Gary |last=Schmitt |title=A Tale of Two Judges |work=The Washington Examiner |date=January 13, 2014 |access-date=October 24, 2019 }}</ref>

On May 7, 2015, in the case of ''ACLU v. Clapper'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] said that [[Section 215]] of the [[Patriot Act]] did not authorize the NSA to collect Americans' calling records in bulk, as exposed by Snowden in 2013. The decision voided U.S. District Judge William Pauley's December 2013 finding that the NSA program was lawful, and remanded the case to him for further review. The appeals court did not rule on the constitutionality of the bulk surveillance, and declined to enjoin the program, noting the pending expiration of relevant parts of the Patriot Act. Circuit Judge [[Gerard E. Lynch]] wrote that, given the national security interests at stake, it was prudent to give Congress an opportunity to debate and decide the matter.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/07/usa-security-nsa-idUSL1N0XY1OK20150507 |title=U.S. NSA's phone spying program ruled illegal by appeals court |work=Reuters |date=May 7, 2015 |access-date=May 7, 2015}}</ref>

On September 2, 2020, a US federal court ruled that the [[US intelligence]]’s mass surveillance program, exposed by Edward Snowden, was illegal and possibly unconstitutional. They also cited that the US intelligence leaders, who publicly defended it, were not telling the truth.<ref name="reuters.com"/>

====USA Freedom Act====
On June 2, 2015, the U.S. Senate passed, and President Obama signed, the [[USA Freedom Act]] which restored in modified form several provisions of the [[Patriot Act]] that had expired the day before, while for the first time imposing some limits on the bulk collection of telecommunication data on U.S. citizens by American intelligence agencies. The new restrictions were widely seen as stemming from Snowden's revelations.<ref name="CNN passes">{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=Jeremy |title=NSA surveillance bill passes after weeks-long showdown |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/02/politics/senate-usa-freedom-act-vote-patriot-act-nsa/ |website=CNN |access-date=June 12, 2015 |quote="The bill's passage is the culmination of efforts to reform the NSA that blossomed out of NSA leaker Edward Snowden's 2013 revelations."}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/02/411534447/senateis-poised-to-vote-on-house-approved-usa-freedom-act |first=Bill |last=Chappell |title=Senate Approves USA Freedom Act, After Amendments Fail |date=June 2, 2015 |work=[[NPR]] |access-date=October 24, 2019 }}</ref>

In an official report published in October 2015, the [[United Nations special rapporteur]] for the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of speech, Professor [[David Kaye (law professor)|David Kaye]], criticized the U.S. government's harsh treatment of, and bringing criminal charges against, whistleblowers, including Edward Snowden.

By mid-2013, Snowden had applied for asylum in 21 countries, including Europe and South America,<ref name=Guardian21CountriesAsylum/><ref name=snowden-asylum-siliconrepublic/> obtaining negative responses in most cases.

Snowden, speaking to a [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] audience via video link from Moscow, said he would love to return to Geneva, where he had previously worked undercover for the CIA. Swiss media said that the Swiss Attorney General had determined that Switzerland would not extradite Snowden if the US request were considered "politically motivated". Switzerland would grant Snowden asylum if he revealed the extent of espionage activities by the United States government. According to the paper ''Sonntags Zeitung'', Snowden would be granted safe entry and residency in Switzerland, in return for his knowledge of American intelligence activities. Swiss paper ''Le Matin'' reported that Snowden's activity could be part of criminal proceedings or part of a parliamentary inquiry. Extradition would also be rejected if Snowden faced the ''death penalty'', for which the United States has already provided assurances. The felony charges with which Snowden is charged, each a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. As reported in ''Der Bund'', upper level Swiss government could create an obstacle.

====France====
On September 16, 2019, it was reported that Snowden had said he "would love" to get political asylum in France.<ref name=snowden-france-asylum>{{cite web | website=www.politco.eu | date=September 16, 2019 | access-date=June 10, 2020 | publisher=Politico | last=Cerulus | first=Laurens | title=Edward Snowden "would love" to get political asylum in France |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/edward-snowden-would-love-to-get-political-asylum-in-frace/}}</ref>
Snowden first applied unsuccessfully for asylum in France in 2013, under then French President [[François Hollande]]. His second request under President  [[Emmanuel Macron]], was favorably received by Justice Minister [[Nicole Belloubet]]. However, no other members of the French government were known to express support for Snowden's asylum request, possibly due to the potential adverse diplomatic consequences.

====Germany====
[[Hans-Georg Maaßen]], head of the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]], Germany's domestic security agency, speculated that Snowden could have been working for the Russian government.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/hans-georg-maassen-edward-snowden-ein-russischer-agent-a-1096833.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=de |title=Verfassungsschutzchef hält russische Agententätigkeit Snowdens für plausibel |trans-title=Head of Constitutional Protection Agency considers it plausible that Snowden is a Russian agent |date=June 10, 2016 |access-date=July 19, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://netzpolitik.org/2016/live-blog-aus-dem-geheimdienst-untersuchungsausschuss-verfassungsschutz-praesident-maassen-und-vorgaenger-fromm/ |work=[[netzpolitik.org]] |date=June 9, 2016 |title=Live-Blog aus dem Geheimdienst-Untersuchungsausschuss: "Ob Snowden russischer Agent ist, kann ich nicht beurteilen." |language=de |trans-title=Live Blog from the German Parliamentary Committee investigation of intelligence agencies: "I cannot assess if Snowden is a Russian agent." |access-date=October 24, 2019 }}</ref> Snowden rejected this insinuation,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/edward-snowden-interview-there-is-still-hope-a-1166752.html |title=Interview with Edward Snowden: 'There Is Still Hope - Even for Me' |date=September 12, 2017 |first1=Martin |last1=Knobbe |first2=Jörg |last2=Schindler |newspaper=[[Spiegel Online]] |page=2}}</ref> speculating on Twitter in German that "it cannot be proven if Maaßen is an agent of the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] or [[Federal Security Service|FSB]]."<ref>{{cite tweet |first=Edward |last=Snowden |user=Snowden |number=740971373321965572 |title=Ob Maaßen Agent des SVR oder FSB ist, kann derzeit nicht belegt werden. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ #BfV #NSAUA |trans-title=At present, it cannot be proven if Maaßen is an agent of the SVR or FSB. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ #BfV #NSAUA |language=de |date=June 9, 2016 |accessdate=October 24, 2019 }}</ref>

According to Finnish foreign ministry spokeswoman [[Tytti Pylkkö]], Snowden made an asylum request to Finland by sending an application to the Finnish embassy in [[Moscow]], while he was confined to the transit area of the [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] in [[Moscow]] but was told that Finnish law required him to be on Finnish soil.<ref name=snowden-finland>{{cite web | website=www.uk.reuters.com | date=July 2, 2013 | access-date=June 12, 2020 | location=Helsinki | author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title=Finland says can't accept Snowden asylum request |url=https://www.uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-security-snowden-finland-idUKBRE96109D20130702}}</ref>

According to the foundation, the prize was for Snowden's work on press freedom. Sweden ultimately rejected Snowden's asylum however, so the award was accepted by his father, Lon Snowden, on his behalf.

Snowden was granted a freedom of speech  award by the Oslo branch of the writer's group [[PEN International]]. He applied for asylum in Norway but Norwegian Justice Secretary {{ill|Pål Lønseth|no}} insisted that the application be made on Norwegian soil and further expressed doubt that Snowden met the criteria for gaining asylum - being "important for foreign political reasons". Snowden then filed a lawsuit for free passage through Norway in order to receiver his freedom of speech award, through Oslo's District Court, followed by an appeals court, and finally Norway's Supreme Court.
