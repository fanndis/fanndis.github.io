'''Ørsted A/S''' (formerly '''DONG Energy''') is a Danish [[multinational corporation|multinational]] power company based in [[Fredericia]], [[Denmark]]. It is the largest [[energy company]] in Denmark. The company adopted its current name on 6 November 2017.

As of 2020, the company is the world's largest developer of [[offshore wind power]], accounting for 29% of global installed capacity and producing 88% of their energy from renewable sources. The company has a goal of net-zero generation by the year 2025 and no [[carbon emissions]] by 2040.<ref>{{cite news |last=Storrow |first=Benjamin |url=https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063713187 |title=How one fossil fuel company became a green giant |work=[[Environment & Energy Publishing]] |date=9 September 2020 |accessdate=10 September 2020 }}</ref>

==History==
Ørsted has its origin in the Danish state-owned company Dansk Naturgas A/S. The company was founded in 1972 to manage gas and oil resources in the Danish sector of the [[North Sea]]. After some years, the company was renamed to '''D'''ansk '''O'''lie og '''N'''atur'''g'''as A/S (DONG), meaning Danish Oil and Natural Gas. At the beginning of the decade of the 2000s, DONG started to expand itself into the [[electricity market]] by taking long positions in electricity companies. In 2005, DONG acquired and merged Danish electrical power producers Elsam and Energi E2 and public utility (electricity distribution) companies NESA, Københavns Energi and Frederiksberg Forsyning. The result of the merger was the creation of DONG Energy. The merger was approved by the [[European Commission]] on 14 March 2006.

In 2002, one of predecessors of DONG Energy named Elsam installed the 160&nbsp;MW [[Horns Rev]] offshore wind farm, which was the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the world.<ref name="ptHorn1">[http://www.power-technology.com/projects/hornsreefwind/ Horns Rev I Offshore Wind Farm, Denmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129222645/http://www.power-technology.com/projects/hornsreefwind/ |date=29 January 2012 }} ''Power Technology''.

In 2005, DONG Energy acquired 10.34% in the [[Ormen Lange (gas field)|Ormen Lange gas field]] (operated by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]). The share of gas reserves allocated to DONG Energy are approximately {{convert|40|e9m3|abbr=off}}.
