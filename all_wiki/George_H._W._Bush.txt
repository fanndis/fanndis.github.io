'''George Herbert Walker Bush'''<ref group="lower-alpha">Since around 2000 he has usually been called '''George H. W. Bush''', '''Bush Senior''', '''Bush 41''' or '''Bush the Elder''' to distinguish him from his eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], who served as the 43rd president from 2001 to 2009; previously he was usually referred to simply as '''George Bush'''.</ref> (June 12, 1924{{spaced ndash}}November 30, 2018) was an American politician and businessman who served as the 41st [[president of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Bush also served as the 43rd [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] from 1981 to 1989, in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], as [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]], and as [[Director of Central Intelligence]].

Bush was raised in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] and attended [[Phillips Academy]] before serving in the navy during World War II. After the war, he graduated from Yale  and moved to [[West Texas]], where he established a successful oil company. After an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate, he won election to the [[Texas's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district of Texas]] in 1966. President Richard Nixon appointed Bush to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1971 and to the position of [[chairman of the Republican National Committee]] in 1973. In 1974, President Gerald Ford appointed him as the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to China#List of Chiefs of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing|Chief of the Liaison Office to the People's Republic of China]], and in 1976 Bush became the [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Bush ran for president in 1980, but was defeated in the [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican presidential primaries]] by Ronald Reagan. He was then elected vice president in 1980 and 1984 as Reagan's running mate.

In the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]], Bush defeated Democrat [[Michael Dukakis]], becoming the first incumbent vice president to be elected president since Martin Van Buren in 1836. Foreign policy drove the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush presidency]], as he navigated the final years of the [[Cold War]] and played a key role in the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. Bush presided over the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]] and the [[Gulf War]], ending the Iraqi occupation of [[Kuwait]] in the latter conflict. Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush negotiated and signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which created a trade bloc consisting of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Domestically, Bush reneged on [[Read my lips: no new taxes|a 1988 campaign promise]] by signing a bill that increased taxes and helped reduce the federal budget deficit. He also signed the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] and appointed [[David Souter]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] to the Supreme Court. Bush lost the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] following an [[Early 1990s recession|economic recession]] and the decreased emphasis of foreign policy in a post–Cold War political climate.

After leaving office in 1993, Bush was active in humanitarian activities, often working alongside Clinton, his former opponent. With the victory of his son, [[George W. Bush]], in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], the two became the second father–son pair to serve as the nation's president, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]]. Another son, [[Jeb Bush]], unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 Republican primaries]]. After a long battle with vascular [[Parkinson's disease]], Bush [[Death and state funeral of George H. W. Bush|died at his home]] on November 30, 2018. Historians generally [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|rank]] Bush as an above average president.

== Early political career (1963–1971) ==
=== Entry into politics ===
[[File:George Herbert Walker Bush and Eisenhower 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Former president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] with Bush]]

By the early 1960s, Bush was widely regarded as an appealing political candidate, and some leading [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] attempted to convince Bush to become a Democrat. He declined to leave the Republican Party, later citing his belief that the national Democratic Party favored "big, centralized government". The Democratic Party had historically dominated Texas, but Republicans scored their first major victory in the state with [[John G. Tower]]'s victory in a 1961 special election to the [[United States Senate]]. Motivated by Tower's victory, and hoping to prevent the far-right [[John Birch Society]] from coming to power, Bush ran for the chairmanship of the [[Harris County, Texas]] Republican Party, winning election in February 1963.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 112–114</ref> Like most other Texas Republicans, Bush supported conservative Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] over the more centrist [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the [[1964 Republican Party presidential primaries]].<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 116–117</ref>

In 1964, Bush sought to unseat liberal Democrat [[Ralph W. Yarborough]] in Texas's [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1964|U.S. Senate election]].<ref name="naftali13">Naftali (2007), p. 13</ref> Bolstered by superior fundraising, Bush won the Republican primary by defeating former gubernatorial nominee [[Jack Cox (Texas politician)|Jack Cox]] in a [[run-off election]]. In the general election, Bush attacked Yarborough's vote for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which banned racial and gender discrimination in public institutions and in many privately owned businesses. Bush argued that the act unconstitutionally expanded the powers of the federal government, but he was privately uncomfortable with the racial politics of opposing the act.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 120–122</ref> He lost the election 56 percent to 44 percent, though he did run well ahead of Goldwater, the Republican presidential nominee.<ref name="naftali13"/> Despite the loss, the ''New York Times'' reported that Bush was "rated by political friend and foe alike as the Republicans' best prospect in Texas because of his attractive personal qualities and the strong campaign he put up for the Senate".<ref>Meacham (2015), p. 133</ref>

===U.S. Representative from Texas===

In [[1966 United States House of Representatives elections|1966]], Bush ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[Texas's 7th congressional district]], a newly redistricted seat in the [[Greater Houston]] area. Initial polling showed him trailing his Democratic opponent, Harris County District Attorney Frank Briscoe, but he ultimately won the race with 57 percent of the vote.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 130–132</ref> In an effort to woo potential candidates in the South and Southwest, House Republicans secured Bush an appointment to the powerful [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]], making Bush the first freshman to serve on the committee since 1904.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 133–134</ref> His voting record in the House was generally [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]]. He supported the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]]'s [[Vietnam War|Vietnam policies]], but broke with Republicans on the issue of [[birth control]], which he supported.

Though most other Texas Republicans supported [[Ronald Reagan]] in the [[1968 Republican Party presidential primaries]], Bush endorsed [[Richard Nixon]], who went on to win the party's nomination. Nixon considered selecting Bush as his running mate in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]], but he ultimately chose [[Spiro Agnew]] instead.

After the 1970 Senate election, Bush accepted a position as a senior adviser to the president, but he convinced Nixon to instead appoint him as the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]].<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 153–154</ref> The position represented Bush's first foray into foreign policy, as well as his first major experiences with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]], the two major U.S. rivals in the [[Cold War]].<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 152, 157–158</ref> During Bush's tenure, the Nixon administration pursued a policy of détente, seeking to ease tensions with both the Soviet Union and China.<ref>Herring (2008), pp. 773–775</ref> Bush's ambassadorship was marked by a defeat on the China question, as the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted to expel the [[Republic of China]] and replace it with the People's Republic of China in October 1971.<ref name="nytimes19711031">{{cite news |last1=Austin |first1=Anthony |title=Crushing Defeat for the U.S., or A Blessing In Disguise? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/31/archives/crushing-defeat-for-the-us-or-a-blessing-in-disguise-enter-peking.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 31, 1971 }}</ref> In the 1971 crisis in [[Pakistan]], Bush supported an [[India]]n motion at the UN General Assembly to condemn the Pakistani government of [[Yahya Khan]] for waging genocide in [[East Pakistan]] (modern [[Bangladesh]]), referring to the "tradition which we have supported that the human rights question transcended domestic jurisdiction and should be freely debated".<ref>Saunders (2014) p.39</ref> Bush's support for India at the UN put him into conflict with Nixon who was supporting Pakistan, partly because [[Yahya Khan]] was a useful intermediary in his attempts to reach out to China and partly because the president was fond of Yahya Khan.<ref>Saunders (2014) p.38-39</ref>

=== Chairman of the Republican National Committee ===

After Nixon won a landslide victory in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], he appointed Bush as chair of the [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC).<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 162–163</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nixontapes.org/presidents.html|title=President Richard Nixon and the Presidents|website=nixontapes.org|quote=CDHW 156-016 11/29/1972 Unknown time between 10:10 am and 1:47 pm P, GHWB}}[https://www.nixontapes.org/ghwb/156-016.pdf]</ref> In that position, he was charged with fundraising, candidate recruitment, and making appearances on behalf of the party in the media.

When Agnew was being investigated for corruption, Bush assisted, at the request of Nixon and Agnew, in pressuring [[John Glenn Beall Jr.]], the U.S. Senator from [[Maryland]] to force his brother, [[George Beall (attorney)|George Beall]] the [[U.S. Attorney]] in Maryland, who was supervising the investigation into Agnew.

During Bush's tenure at the RNC, the [[Watergate scandal]] emerged into public view; the scandal originated from the June 1972 break-in of the [[Democratic National Committee]], but also involved later efforts to cover up the break-in by Nixon and other members of the White House.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 163–164</ref> Bush initially defended Nixon steadfastly, but as Nixon's complicity became clear he focused more on defending the Republican Party.<ref name="ea" />

Following the resignation of Vice President Agnew in 1973 for a scandal unrelated to Watergate, Bush was considered for the position of vice president, but the appointment instead went to [[Gerald Ford]].<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 166–167</ref> After the public release of an [[Nixon White House tapes|audio recording]] that confirmed that Nixon had plotted to use the CIA to cover up the Watergate break-in, Bush joined other party leaders in urging Nixon to resign.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 170–173</ref> When Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, Bush noted in his diary that "There was an aura of sadness, like somebody died... The [resignation] speech was vintage Nixon—a kick or two at the press—enormous strains. One couldn't help but look at the family and the whole thing and think of his accomplishments and then think of the shame...

Upon his ascension to the presidency, Ford [[1974 United States vice presidential confirmation|strongly considered]] Bush, [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and [[Nelson Rockefeller]] for the vacant position of vice president.

Bush was assigned by Reagan to chair two special task forces, one on [[deregulation]] and one on international drug smuggling. Both were popular issues with conservatives, and Bush, largely a moderate, began courting them through his work. The deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules, making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise, in order to curb the size of the federal government.<ref name="senate" /> The Reagan administration's deregulation push had a strong impact on broadcasting, finance, resource extraction, and other economic activities, and the administration eliminated numerous government positions.<ref>Leuchtenberg (2015), pp. 601-604</ref> Bush also oversaw the administration's national security crisis management organization, which had traditionally been the responsibility of the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]].<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 267–268</ref> In 1983, Bush toured [[Western Europe]] as part of the Reagan administration's ultimately successful efforts to convince skeptical [[NATO]] allies to support the deployment of [[Pershing II]] missiles.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 285–287</ref>

In 1986, the Reagan administration was shaken by a scandal when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to [[Iran]] during the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

[[File:Gwbush1988stl.jpg|thumb|[[John Ashcroft]] and Vice President Bush campaign in St. Louis, Missouri, 1988]]

Bush began planning for a presidential run after the 1984 election, and he officially entered the [[1988 Republican Party presidential primaries]] in October 1987.<ref name="senate" /> He put together a campaign led by Reagan staffer [[Lee Atwater]], and which also included his son, George W.

Bush, occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to Reagan, delivered a well-received speech at the Republican convention. Known as the "[[thousand points of light]]" speech, it described Bush's vision of America: he endorsed the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], [[school prayer|prayer in schools]], [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]], and [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|gun rights]].<ref name="npr">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/news/national/election2000/conventions/past.bushsenior.html|title=1988: George H.

[[File:ElectoralCollege1988.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Bush won the 1988 presidential election with 53.4% of the popular vote and a large majority of the electoral vote]]

Meanwhile, the Democratic Party nominated Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], who was known for presiding over an economic turnaround in Massachusetts.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 37–39</ref> Leading in the general election polls against Bush, Dukakis ran an ineffective, low-risk campaign.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 39, 47</ref> The Bush campaign attacked Dukakis as an unpatriotic liberal extremist and seized on the [[Willie Horton]] case, in which a convicted felon from Massachusetts raped a woman while on a [[prison furlough]], a program Dukakis supported as governor. The Bush campaign charged that Dukakis presided over a "[[revolving door]]" that allowed dangerous convicted felons to leave prison.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 44–46</ref> Dukakis damaged his own campaign with a widely mocked ride in an [[M1 Abrams]] tank and a poor performance at the second presidential debate.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 47–49</ref> Bush also attacked Dukakis for opposing a law that would require all students to recite the [[Pledge of Allegiance]].<ref name="npr" /> The election is widely considered to have had a high level of negative campaigning, though political scientist John Geer has argued that the share of negative ads was in line with previous presidential elections.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 347–348</ref>

During the 1980s, the U.S. had provided aid to [[Panama]]nian leader [[Manuel Noriega]], an anti-Communist dictator who engaged in drug trafficking. In May 1989, Noriega annulled the results of a democratic presidential election in which [[Guillermo Endara]] had been elected. Bush objected to the annulment of the election and worried about the status of the [[Panama Canal]] with Noriega still in office.<ref name="patterson226227">Patterson (2005), pp. 226–227</ref> Bush dispatched 2,000 soldiers to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises in violation of prior treaties.<ref name="rutgers">{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/panama.htm|title=Panama: Background and Buildup to Invasion of 1989|accessdate=April 11, 2008|author=Franklin, Jane|year=2001|publisher=Rutgers University}}</ref> After a U.S. serviceman was shot by Panamanian forces in December 1989, Bush ordered the [[United States invasion of Panama]], known as "Operation Just Cause". The invasion was the first large-scale American military operation in more than 40 years that was not related to the Cold War. American forces quickly took control of the Panama Canal Zone and [[Panama City]]. Noriega surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was quickly transported to a prison in the United States. Twenty-three Americans died in the operation, while another 394 were wounded. Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.<ref name="patterson226227"/> Historian Stewart Brewer argues that the invasion "represented a new era in American foreign policy" because Bush did not justify the invasion under the [[Monroe Doctrine]] or the threat of Communism, but rather on the grounds that it was in the best interests of the United States.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stewart Brewer|title=Borders and Bridges: A History of U.S.-Latin American Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPod9HcYUJ4C&pg=PA146|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood |page=146|isbn=9780275982041}}</ref>

Faced with massive debts and low oil prices in the aftermath of the [[Iran–Iraq War]], Iraqi leader [[Saddam Hussein]] decided to conquer the country of [[Kuwait]], a small, oil-rich country situated on Iraq's southern border.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 139–141</ref> After Iraq [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded]] Kuwait in August 1990, Bush imposed [[Sanctions against Iraq|economic sanctions]] on Iraq and assembled a [[Coalition of the Gulf War|multi-national coalition]] opposed to the invasion.<ref name="patterson230232">Patterson (2005), pp. 230–232</ref> The administration feared that a failure to respond to the invasion would embolden Hussein to attack [[Saudi Arabia]] or Israel, and wanted to discourage other countries from similar aggression.<ref>Herring (2008), pp. 908–909</ref> Bush also wanted to ensure continued access to oil, as Iraq and Kuwait collectively accounted for 20 percent of the world's oil production, and Saudi Arabia produced another 26 percent of the world's oil supply.<ref>Patterson (2005), p. 233</ref>

At Bush's insistence, in November 1990, the [[United Nations Security Council]] approved a resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq did not withdrawal from Kuwait by January 15, 1991.<ref>Patterson (2005), p. 232</ref> Gorbachev's support, as well as China's abstention, helped ensure passage of the UN resolution.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 146–147, 159</ref> Bush convinced Britain, France, and other nations to commit soldiers to an operation against Iraq, and he won important financial backing from Germany, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and the [[United Arab Emirates]].<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 149–151</ref> In January 1991, Bush asked Congress to approve a joint resolution authorizing a war against Iraq.<ref name="patterson232233">Patterson (2005), pp. 232–233</ref> Bush believed that the UN resolution had already provided him with the necessary authorization to launch a military operation against Iraq, but he wanted to show that the nation was united behind a military action.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 160–161</ref> Despite the opposition of a majority of Democrats in both the House and the Senate, Congress approved the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991]].<ref name="patterson232233"/>

After the January 15 deadline passed without an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, U.S. and coalition forces began a conducted a bombing campaign that devastated Iraq's power grid and communications network, and resulted in the desertion of about 100,000 Iraqi soldiers.

====Economy and fiscal issues====

The U.S. economy had generally performed well since emerging from [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|recession in late 1982]], but it slipped into a mild [[Early 1990s recession in the United States|recession in 1990]].

Bush and congressional leaders agreed to avoid major changes to the budget for [[fiscal year#United States|fiscal year]] 1990, which began in October 1989. However, both sides knew that spending cuts or new taxes would be necessary in the following year's budget in order to avoid the draconian automatic domestic spending cuts required by the [[Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act]] of 1987.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 95–97</ref> Bush and other leaders also wanted to cut deficits because Federal Reserve Chair [[Alan Greenspan]] refused to lower interest rates, and thus stimulate economic growth, unless the federal budget deficit was reduced.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 409–410</ref> In a statement released in late June 1990, Bush said that he would be open to a deficit reduction program which included spending cuts, incentives for economic growth, budget process reform, as well as tax increases.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Balz| first1=Dan| last2=Yang| first2=John E.| title=Bush Abandons Campaign Pledge, Calls for New Taxes| date=June 27, 1990| work=The Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/06/27/bush-abandons-campaign-pledge-calls-for-new-taxes/a7ea302f-cecb-43b0-8d8e-5009bc294ee3/?noredirect=on| accessdate=June 7, 2018}}</ref> To [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservatives]] in the Republican Party, Bush's statement represented a betrayal, and they heavily criticized him for compromising so early in the negotiations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Heclo |first=Hugh |editor1-last=Nelson |editor1-first=Michael |editor2-last=Perry |editor2-first=Barbara A. |title=41: Inside the Presidency of George H.

In September 1990, Bush and Congressional Democrats announced a compromise to cut funding for mandatory and discretionary programs while also raising revenue, partly through a higher gas tax. The compromise additionally included a [[PAYGO|"pay as you go"]] provision that required that new programs be paid for at the time of implementation.<ref name="greene100104">Greene (2015), pp. 100–104</ref> House Minority Whip [[Newt Gingrich]] led the conservative opposition to the bill, strongly opposing any form of tax increase.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 446–447</ref> Some liberals also criticized the budget cuts in the compromise, and in October, the House rejected the deal, resulting in a brief government shutdown. Without the strong backing of the Republican Party, Bush agreed to another compromise bill, this one more favorable to Democrats. The [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]] (OBRA-90), enacted on October 27, 1990, dropped much of the gasoline tax increase in favor of higher income taxes on top earners. It included cuts to domestic spending, but the cuts were not as deep as those that had been proposed in the original compromise. Bush's decision to sign the bill damaged his standing with conservatives and the general public, but it also laid the groundwork for the budget surpluses of the late 1990s.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 104–106</ref>

The [[disability|disabled]] had not received legal protections under the landmark [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and many faced discrimination and segregation by the time Bush took office. In 1988, [[Lowell P. Weicker Jr.]] and [[Tony Coelho]] had introduced the Americans with Disabilities Act, which barred employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. The bill had passed the Senate but not the House, and it was reintroduced in 1989. Though some conservatives opposed the bill due to its costs and potential burdens on businesses, Bush strongly supported it, partly because his son, Neil, had struggled with [[dyslexia]]. After the bill passed both houses of Congress, Bush signed the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] into law in July 1990.<ref name="greene9092">Greene (2015), pp. 90–92</ref> The act required employers and public accommodations to make "reasonable accommodations" for the disabled, while providing an exception when such accommodations imposed an "undue hardship".<ref name="griffin1">{{cite news|last1=Griffin|first1=Rodman|title=The Disabilities Act|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1991122700|accessdate=August 25, 2016|publisher=CQPress|date=December 27, 1991}}</ref>

Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] later led the congressional passage of a separate civil rights bill designed to facilitate launching employment discrimination lawsuits.<ref name="greene7980">Greene (2015), pp. 79–80</ref> In vetoing the bill, Bush argued that it would lead to racial quotas in hiring.<ref>[[Ann Devroy|Devroy, Ann]].

====Points of Light====

President Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of America's most serious social problems. He often used the "[[thousand points of light]]" theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems.

===1992 presidential campaign===

Bush announced his reelection bid in early 1992; with a coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings, Bush's reelection initially looked likely.<ref name="skornacki">{{cite news|last1=Kornacki|first1=Steve|title=What if Mario Cuomo had run for president?|url=https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/what-if-mario-cuomo-had-run-president|accessdate=August 25, 2016|publisher=MSNBC|date=January 2, 2015}}</ref> As a result, many leading Democrats, including [[Mario Cuomo]], [[Dick Gephardt]], and [[Al Gore]], declined to seek their party's presidential nomination.<ref>Waterman (1996), pp. 337–338</ref> However, Bush's tax increase had angered many conservatives, who believed that Bush had strayed from the conservative principles of Ronald Reagan.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 444–445</ref> He faced a challenge from conservative political columnist [[Pat Buchanan]] in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1992|1992 Republican primaries]].<ref>Patterson (2005), p. 246</ref> Bush fended off Buchanan's challenge and won his party's nomination at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]], but the convention adopted a socially conservative platform strongly influenced by the [[Christian right]].<ref>Patterson (2005), pp. 251–252</ref>

[[File:ElectoralCollege1992.svg|upright=1.3|thumb|Bush was defeated in the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]] by [[Bill Clinton]]]]

Meanwhile, the Democrats nominated Governor [[Bill Clinton]] of Arkansas. A moderate who was affiliated with the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC), Clinton favored welfare reform, deficit reduction, and a tax cut for the middle class.<ref>Patterson (2005), pp. 247–248</ref> In early 1992, the race took an unexpected twist when Texas billionaire [[H.

His message appealed to voters across the political spectrum disappointed with both parties' perceived fiscal irresponsibility.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Perot Vote|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/case/3pt/perot_vote.html}}</ref> Perot also attacked NAFTA, which he claimed would lead to major job losses.<ref>Patterson (2005), p. 251</ref> National polling taken in mid-1992 showed Perot in the lead, but Clinton experienced a surge through effective campaigning and the selection of Senator Al Gore, a popular and relatively young Southerner, as his running mate.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 504–506</ref>

Clinton won the election, taking 43 percent of the popular vote and 370 electoral votes, while Bush won 37.5 percent of the popular vote and 168 electoral votes.<ref>{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1992|website=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}</ref> Perot won 19% of the popular vote, one of the [[List of third party performances in United States presidential elections|highest totals for a third party candidate]] in U.S. history, drawing equally from both major candidates, according to exit polls.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holmes |first=Steven A. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DB1F3FF936A35752C1A964958260 |title=The 1992 Elections: Disappointment – News Analysis – An Eccentric but No Joke; Perot's Strong Showing Raises Questions On What Might Have Been, and Might Be – |work=The New York Times |date=November 5, 1992 |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}</ref> Clinton performed well in the Northeast, the Midwest, and the West Coast, while also waging the strongest Democratic campaign in the South since the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 election]].<ref>Patterson (2005), pp. 252–253</ref> Several factors were important in Bush's defeat.

Polls of historians and political scientists have [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|ranked]] Bush in the top half of presidents.

Biographer Jon Meacham writes that, after he left office, many Americans viewed Bush as "a gracious and underappreciated man who had many virtues but who had failed to project enough of a distinctive identity and vision to overcome the economic challenges of 1991–92 and to win a second term."<ref>Meacham (2015), p. 567</ref> Bush himself noted that his legacy was "lost between the glory of Reagan ... and the trials and tribulations of my sons."<ref>Meacham (2015), p. 595</ref> In the 2010s, Bush was fondly remembered for his willingness to compromise, which contrasted with the intensely partisan era that followed his presidency.<ref name="jshesol1">{{cite magazine|last1=Shesol|first1=Jeff|title=What George H.

According to ''[[USA Today]]'', the legacy of Bush's presidency was defined by his victory over Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait, and for his presiding over the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and the [[German reunification]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Remembering Former President George H.W.
