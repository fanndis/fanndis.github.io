[[Vancouverism]] is the city's [[urban planning]] design philosophy.

Vancouver was originally named [[Gastown]] and began as a settlement which grew around the site of a makeshift tavern on the western edges of [[Hastings Mill]] that was built on July 1, 1867 and owned by proprietor [[Gassy Jack]]. The original site is marked by the Gastown steam clock. Gastown then formally registered as a [[townsite]] dubbed [[Granville, British Columbia|Granville]], [[Burrard Inlet]]. The city was renamed "Vancouver" in 1886, through a deal with the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR). The Canadian Pacific transcontinental railway was extended to the city by 1887. The city's large natural seaport on the [[Pacific Ocean]] became a vital link in the trade between [[Asia-Pacific]], [[East Asia]], [[Europe]], and [[Eastern Canada]].<ref name="Morley">{{cite book |last=Morley |first=A. |year=1974 |title=Vancouver, from milltown to metropolis |lccn=64026114 |location=Vancouver |publisher=Mitchell Press}}</ref><ref name="STEV">{{Cite book |last=Norris |first=John M. |lccn=72170963 |title=Strangers Entertained |publisher=Vancouver, British Columbia Centennial '71 Committee |year=1971}}</ref>

Europeans became acquainted with the area of the future Vancouver when [[José María Narváez]] of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] explored the coast of present-day [[West Point Grey|Point Grey]] and parts of [[Burrard Inlet]] in 1791—although one author contends that [[Francis Drake]] may have [[New Albion#Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada|visited the area in 1579]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bawlf |first=R.

===Early growth===

The [[Fraser Gold Rush]] of 1858 brought over 25,000 men, mainly from California, to nearby [[New Westminster]] (founded February 14, 1859) on the [[Fraser River]], on their way to the [[Fraser Canyon]], bypassing what would become Vancouver.<ref name="Vancouver's past">{{cite book |last1=Hull |first1=Raymond |title=Vancouver's Past |publisher=University of Washington Press |year=1974 |location=Seattle |first2=Christine |last2=Soules |first3=Gordon |last3=Soules |isbn=978-0-295-95364-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=McGowan's War |publisher=New Star Books |isbn=1-55420-001-6 |first=Donald J. |last=Hauka |year=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Matthews |first=J.S.

A sawmill established at Moodyville (now the [[North Vancouver (city)|City of North Vancouver]]) in 1863, began the city's long relationship with logging. It was quickly followed by mills owned by Captain Edward Stamp on the south shore of the inlet. Stamp, who had begun logging in the [[Port Alberni]] area, first attempted to run a mill at [[Brockton Point]], but difficult currents and reefs forced the relocation of the operation in 1867 to a point near the foot of Dunlevy Street. This mill, known as the [[Hastings Mill]], became the nucleus around which Vancouver formed. The mill's central role in the city waned after the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in the 1880s. It nevertheless remained important to the local economy until it closed in the 1920s.<ref name="GVB">{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Chuck |title=The Greater Vancouver Book: An Urban Encyclopaedia |publisher=Linkman Press |year=1997 |location=Surrey, British Columbia |pages=39–47 |isbn=1-896846-00-9}}</ref> The settlement, which came to be called Gastown, grew quickly around the original makeshift tavern established by "Gassy" [[John Deighton|Jack Deighton]] in 1867 on the edge of the Hastings Mill property.<ref name="Horizons" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gastown.org/history/index.html |title=Welcome to Gastown |date=March 28, 2008 |publisher=Gastown Business Improvement Society |accessdate=December 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125034053/http://www.gastown.org/history/index.html |archive-date=November 25, 2009}}</ref>

In 1870, the [[Colony of British Columbia (1866-1871)|colonial government]] surveyed the settlement and laid out a townsite, renamed "Granville" in honour of the then-British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]].

Vancouver merchants outfitted prospectors bound for the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in 1898.<ref name="Vancouver's past" /> One of those merchants, Charles Woodward, had opened the first [[Woodward's]] store at Abbott and Cordova Streets in 1892 and, along with [[Spencer's (department store)|Spencer's]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson's Bay]] department stores, formed the core of the city's retail sector for decades.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History: Acquisitions, Retail, Woodward's Stores Limited |publisher=Hudson's Bay Company |url=http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/history/acquisitions/retail/woodwards.asp |accessdate=June 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227013354/http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/history/acquisitions/retail/woodwards.asp |archive-date=February 27, 2007 }}</ref>

The [[Strait of Georgia]], to the west, is shielded from the Pacific Ocean by [[Vancouver Island]]. The city has an area of {{convert|114|km2|abbr=on}}, including both flat and hilly ground and is in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] (UTC−8) and the [[Pacific Maritime Ecozone]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Pacific Maritime Ecozone |publisher=Environment Canada |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Framework/Nardesc/pacmar_e.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040621163804/http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Framework/Nardesc/pacmar_e.cfm |archive-date=June 21, 2004 |date=April 11, 2005 |accessdate=December 1, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Ecology===
The vegetation in the Vancouver area was originally [[temperate rain forest]], consisting of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] with scattered pockets of maple and alder and large areas of swampland (even in upland areas, due to poor drainage).<ref>{{cite web |title=Stanley Park History |url=http://vancouver.ca/Parks/parks/stanley/history.htm |publisher=City of Vancouver |year=2009 |accessdate=December 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/619GCCf3J?url=http://vancouver.ca/Parks/parks/stanley/history.htm |archive-date=August 23, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The conifers were a typical coastal British Columbia mix of [[Douglas-fir|Douglas fir]], [[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]] and [[western hemlock]].<ref>{{cite web |title="Lower Mainland Ecoregion": Narrative Descriptions of Terrestrial Ecozones and Ecoregions of Canada (#196) |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Framework/Nardesc/Region.cfm?region=196 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127133028/http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Framework/Nardesc/Region.cfm?region=196 |archive-date=January 27, 2007 |publisher=Environment Canada |accessdate=December 4, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The area is thought to have had the largest trees of these species on the [[British Columbia Coast]].

The forest in Stanley Park was logged between the 1860s and 1880s and evidence of old-fashioned logging techniques such as [[Logging#Springboards|springboard notches]] can still be seen there.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vancouver.ca/Parks/parks/stanley/nature.htm |title=Stanley Park: Forest – Monument Trees |publisher=City of Vancouver |year=2009 |accessdate=December 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201164108/http://vancouver.ca/Parks/parks/stanley/nature.htm |archive-date=December 1, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Many plants and trees growing throughout Vancouver and the Lower Mainland were imported from other parts of the continent and from points across the Pacific. Examples include the [[araucaria araucana|monkey puzzle tree]], the [[Acer palmatum|Japanese maple]] and various flowering exotics, such as [[magnolia]]s, [[azalea]]s  and [[rhododendron]]s. Some species imported from harsher climates in Eastern Canada or Europe have grown to immense sizes. The native [[Acer glabrum|Douglas maple]] can also attain a tremendous size. Many of the city's streets are lined with flowering varieties of [[Sakura|Japanese cherry]] trees donated from the 1930s onward by the government of Japan. These flower for several weeks in early spring each year, an occasion celebrated by the [[Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival]]. Other streets are lined with flowering chestnut, [[Aesculus hippocastanum|horse chestnut]] and other decorative shade trees.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.vcbf.ca/history |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503001521/http://www.vcbf.ca/history |archive-date=May 3, 2009 |publisher=Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival |year=2009 |accessdate=November 30, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Vancouver is one of Canada's warmest cities in the winter. Vancouver's climate is temperate by Canadian standards and is classified as [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] or [[marine west coast]], ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') that borders on a warm-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csb''). While during summer months the inland temperatures are significantly higher, Vancouver has the coolest summer average high of all major Canadian metropolitan areas. The summer months are typically dry, with an average of only one in five days during July and August receiving precipitation. In contrast, the majority of days from November through March record some type of precipitation.<ref name="vanprecip">{{cite web |url=http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=882&lang=e&dCode=0&StationName=VANCOUVER&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12 |title=Station Results: Vancouver City Hall, 1971–2000 |publisher=Environment Canada |accessdate=November 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609134613/http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=882&lang=e&dCode=0&StationName=VANCOUVER&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12 |archive-date=June 9, 2012 }}</ref>

Vancouver, unlike other British Columbia municipalities, is [[Local government in Canada|incorporated]] under the ''[[Vancouver Charter]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/vanch_00 |title=Vancouver Charter |publisher=Queen's Printer |date=November 18, 2009 |accessdate=November 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706165944/http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/vanch_00 |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The legislation, passed in 1953, supersedes the ''Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921'' and grants the city more and different powers than other communities possess under BC's ''Municipalities Act''.

The civic government was dominated by the centre-right [[Non-Partisan Association]] (NPA) since [[World War II]], albeit with some significant centre-left interludes until 2008.<ref name="GVB" /> The NPA fractured over the issue of [[narcotic|drug]] policy in 2002, facilitating a landslide victory for the [[Coalition of Progressive Electors]] (COPE) on a [[harm reduction]] platform. Subsequently, North America's only legal [[Insite|safe injection site]] was opened for the significant number of intravenous heroin users in the city.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15130282 |title=Vancouver Insite drug-injection facility can stay open |work=BBC News |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930151624/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15130282 |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Vancouver is governed by the eleven-member [[Vancouver City Council]], a nine-member School Board, and a seven-member [[Vancouver Park Board|Park Board]], all of whom serve four-year terms. Unusually for a city of Vancouver's size, all municipal elections are on an [[at-large]] basis. Historically, in all levels of government, the more affluent west side of Vancouver has voted along [[Conservatism in Canada|conservative]] or [[Liberalism in Canada|liberal]] lines while the eastern side of the city has voted along [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] lines.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Andrea Barbara |last=Smith |title=The Origins of the NPA: A Study in Vancouver Politics |version=MA thesis |publisher=University of British Columbia |year=1981}}</ref> This was reaffirmed with the results of the [[2005 British Columbia general election|2005 provincial election]] and the [[Canadian federal election results in Vancouver and the Northern Lower Mainland|2006 federal election]].

Though polarized, a political [[consensus]] has emerged in Vancouver around a number of issues. Protection of urban parks, a focus on the development of [[rapid transit]] as opposed to a freeway system, a harm-reduction approach to illegal drug use, and a general concern about community-based development are examples of policies that have come to have broad support across the [[political spectrum]] in Vancouver.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In the [[2008 Vancouver municipal election|2008 Municipal Election]] campaign, NPA incumbent mayor [[Sam Sullivan]] was ousted as mayoral candidate by the party in a close vote, which instated Peter Ladner as the new mayoral candidate for the NPA. [[Gregor Robertson (politician)|Gregor Robertson]], a former MLA for [[Vancouver-Fairview]] and head of [[Happy Planet]], was the mayoral candidate for Vision Vancouver, the other main contender. Vision Vancouver candidate Gregor Robertson defeated Ladner by a considerable margin, nearing 20,000 votes. The balance of power was significantly shifted to Vision Vancouver, which held seven of the 10 spots for councillor. Of the remaining three, COPE received two and the NPA one. For park commissioner, four spots went to Vision Vancouver, one to the Green Party, one to COPE, and one to NPA. For school trustee, there were four Vision Vancouver seats, three COPE seats, and two NPA seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vancouver.ca/electionresults2008 |title=Vancouver Votes Municipal Election 2008 |publisher=City of Vancouver |accessdate=November 29, 2009}}</ref> In the [[2018 Vancouver municipal election]], independent [[Kennedy Stewart (Canadian politician)|Kennedy Stewart]] was elected [[mayor of Vancouver]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zussman |first1=Richard |last2=Ferreras |first2=Jesse |title=B.C. municipal election 2018: Vancouver results - BC {{!}} Globalnews.ca |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4166537/vancouver-bc-municipal-election-2018/ |website=globalnews.ca |language=en |date=30 June 2018 |access-date=February 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009090835/https://globalnews.ca/news/4166537/vancouver-bc-municipal-election-2018/ |archive-date=October 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Vancouver's budget consists of a capital and an operating component. The 2017 operating budget was $1.323{{nbsp}}billion, while the 2018 operating budget is $1.407{{nbsp}}billion (a year over year increase of 6.4%). The capital budget for 2018 is unchanged from 2017 and stands at $426.4{{nbsp}}million.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/vancouver-2018-budget-highlights.pdf |title=Vancouver 2018 Budget Highlights |date=January 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108232404/http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/vancouver-2018-budget-highlights.pdf |archive-date=January 8, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Budget increases are largely funded through increases in property taxes and community amenity contributions imposed in exchange for increases in allowable density as part of the construction permitting process. Utility fees and other user fees have also been increased, but represent a comparatively small portion of Vancouver's overall budget.

===Regional government===
[[File:Vancouver Metropolitan Area, 2018.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vancouver Metropolitan Area]] in 2018]]
Vancouver is a member municipality of [[Metro Vancouver]], a regional government. In total there are 22 municipalities, one electoral area and one treaty First Nation comprising Metro Vancouver,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrovancouver.org/about/Pages/default.aspx |title=Who is Metro Vancouver |publisher=Metro Vancouver |accessdate=August 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820020310/http://www.metrovancouver.org/about/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date=August 20, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> the regional government whose seat is in Burnaby. While each member of Metro Vancouver has its own separate local governing body, Metro Vancouver oversees common services and planning functions within the area such as providing drinking water; operating sewage and solid waste handling; maintaining regional parks; overseeing air quality, greenhouse gases and ecological health; and providing a strategy for regional growth and land use.

===Provincial and federal representation===
In the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]], Vancouver is represented by 11 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs). As of July 2017, there are three seats held by the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal Party]] and eight by the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|BC New Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leg.bc.ca/mla/MLALookup/LocIndex.asp?Community=V |title=MLA Finder |accessdate=January 30, 2012 |publisher=Legislative Assembly of British Columbia |date=July 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112101537/http://www.leg.bc.ca/mla/MLALookup/LocIndex.asp?Community=V |archive-date=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

In the [[House of Commons of Canada]], Vancouver is represented by six members of Parliament. In the most recent [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]], the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] retained two ([[Vancouver Quadra]] and [[Vancouver Centre]]) seats and gained another two, while the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|NDP]] held on to the two seats ([[Vancouver East]] and [[Vancouver Kingsway]]), they held at dissolution while the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] were shut out of the city. One current Cabinet minister hails from the city – [[Vancouver South]] MP [[Harjit Sajjan]] is Minister of National Defence.

===Policing and crime===
[[File:Vancouver Police.jpg|thumb|Mounted officers of the [[Vancouver Police Department]] in [[Stanley Park]]]]

==Sustainability==
[[File:Vancouver street recycling.JPG|thumb|Container recycling, paper recycling and garbage bins in Vancouver]]
The City of Vancouver has taken a number of steps to become a sustainable city. Electricity used in Vancouver is generated using sustainable resources such as hydroelectric power. The city benefits from being located close to the mountains as hydroelectric generating stations provide 93 percent of the electricity by using falling water without emitting any greenhouse gases or polluting the air. The city is also actively working towards becoming a greener city. The City of Vancouver has crafted an action plan of goals it has set to meet by 2020, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, encouraging the growth of green jobs and businesses, requiring green construction, and reducing waste.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/Greenest-city-action-plan.pdf |title=Greenest City 2020 Action Plan – the City's Sustainability Plan |accessdate=March 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203184248/http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/Greenest-city-action-plan.pdf |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Vancouver's greenest city action plan|Greenest City action plan]] (GCAP) is a City of Vancouver urban sustainability initiative.
