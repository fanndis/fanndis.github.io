'''Republicanism in New Zealand''' is a political position that holds that [[New Zealand]]'s system of government should be changed from a [[Monarchy of New Zealand|constitutional monarchy]] to a [[republic]].

New Zealand republicanism dates back to the 19th century, although until the late 20th century it was a fringe movement. The current main republican lobby group, [[New Zealand Republic]], was established in 1994. Because [[Constitution of New Zealand|New Zealand's constitution]] is uncodified, a republic could be enacted by [[statute]], as a simple [[New Zealand Parliament|act of parliament]].{{sfn|Quentin-Baxter & McLean|2017|p=314}} However, it is generally assumed that this would only occur following a nationwide [[referendum]].{{sfn|Quentin-Baxter & McLean|2017|p=315}} Several [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime ministers]] and [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governors-general]] have identified themselves as republicans, although no government has yet taken any meaningful steps towards enacting a republic. Public opinion polls have generally found that a majority of the population favour retaining the monarchy.

==History==
The term "republic" in New Zealand has been used as a protest and a pejorative against the central government and/or royalty, to describe an area independent of the central government.

===19th century===
The first use of the term "republic" to connote an independent state in New Zealand came in 1840 when Lieutenant-Governor [[William Hobson]] described the [[New Zealand Company]] settlement of Port Nicholson ([[Wellington]]), which had its own constitution and governing council, as such.<ref name="hobson-republic">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/H/HobsonWilliam/HobsonWilliam/en| title= Te Ara - William Hobson | accessdate=2006-07-12}}</ref> The existence of the council prompted Hobson to declare British sovereignty over the entirety of New Zealand on 21 May 1840, despite the fact the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was still being signed throughout the country.{{sfn|Hamer|1990|p=167}} Hobson dispatched the Colonial Secretary, [[Willoughby Shortland]] along with some soldiers to demand the settlers disband their "illegal association" and remove the flag of the [[United Tribes of New Zealand]].{{sfn|Hamer|1990|p=167}}

Later, Wellington became the centre of agitation by settlers for representative government, which was granted by the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]]. [[Samuel Revans]], who founded the Wellington Settlers' Constitutional Association in 1848, advocated a New Zealand republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=1R5|title=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography - Samuel Revans|accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Hamer|1990|p=93}}

In 1879 the people of [[Hawera]] declared themselves the "Republic of Hawera," due to a campaign by Māori leader [[Te Whiti o Rongomai|Te Whiti]] against European settlement.<ref name="Hawera">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/H/HaweraRepublicOf/HaweraRepublicOf/en| title= Te Ara - Hawera, Republic of | accessdate=2006-07-12}}</ref> They formed their own volunteer units to oppose Te Whiti. In 1881 government troops invaded [[Parihaka]] and arrested Te Whiti, bringing the "republic" to an end.

===20th century===
In the [[1911 New Zealand general election|1911 general election]] Colonel [[Allen Bell]], the [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform Party]] candidate for the [[Raglan (New Zealand electorate)|Raglan]] seat, advocated the abolition of the monarchy. The armed forces considered that Bell had broken his Oath of Allegiance. He was asked to resign his commission, which he did in January 1912.<ref name="dnzb">{{cite web|url=http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/DNZB/alt_essayBody.asp?essayID=3B24|title=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography - Allen Bell|author=J. A. B. Crawford}}</ref>

In 1966 [[Bruce Jesson]] founded the [[Republican Association of New Zealand]], and later the [[New Zealand Republican Party (1967)|Republican Party]] in 1967. The party had a stridently nationalist platform.<ref name="republic_party">{{cite web|title=The way we were|author=Jonathan Milne|date=April 1996|url=http://www.republic.org.nz/node/29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725185928/http://www.republic.org.nz/node/29|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-07-25|accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref> Republican Party activity petered out after the [[1969 New Zealand general election|1969 general election]] and the party wound up in 1974.

In May 1973, a remit was proposed at the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] national conference to change the flag, declare New Zealand a republic, and change the national anthem (then only "[[God Save the Queen]]"), but this was voted down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/John%20Moody.pdf|title=Past Attempts to Change New Zealand's Flag|author=John Moody|publisher=New Zealand Flag Association}}</ref>

[[File:Jim Bolger at press conference retouched.jpg|150px|thumb|Jim Bolger, Prime Minister 1990–1997 and leader of the National Party, raised the republic issue in 1994.]]
In March 1994 the [[New Zealand Republic|Republican Coalition of New Zealand]] was formed to promote the move to a republic. The following year, the Monarchist League of New Zealand (now [[Monarchy New Zealand]]) was established to defend the constitutional monarchy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yang |first1=Unity Elias |title=Last Great Queen? |date=2014 |publisher=Author House |isbn=978-1-4918-9515-3 |page=192 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHtwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA192 }}</ref>

In 1994 [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Jim Bolger]] suggested to the [[44th New Zealand Parliament|44th Parliament]] in the [[Speech from the throne|Address In Reply]] debate that New Zealand should move to become a republic by 2001. Bolger stated that New Zealand's links with Britain were in decline, and that the country should acknowledge that "the tide of history is moving in one direction."<ref name="bolger_book">{{cite book|title=Bolger: A view from the top - my seven years as Prime Minister|author=Jim Bolger|publisher=Viking|year=1998|isbn=0-670-88369-7}}</ref> He denied that his views relate to his [[Irish New Zealanders|Irish heritage]].<ref name="bolger_book" />

Bolger spoke to Queen Elizabeth about the issue of New Zealand becoming a republic when he was prime minister and recalled "I have more than once spoken with Her Majesty about my view that New Zealand would at some point elect its own Head of State, we discussed the matter in a most sensible way and she was in no way surprised or alarmed and neither did she cut my head off."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10436441|title=Bolger told Queen monarchy's time numbered|author=Maggie Tait|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=2007-04-27|date=27 April 2007}}</ref>

In 1998, Richard Nottage, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade, called for New Zealand to consider becoming a republic, arguing that the position of the "British monarch" {{sic}} as head of state "looks strange in Asian eyes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/New_Zealands_Monarchy.htm|title=National Business Review, 27 March 1998, cited by Noel Cox in ''Future of the Monarchy in New Zealand'' New Zealand Politics in Transition|author=Noel Cox|publisher=Oxford University Press, Auckland, 2001|accessdate=2008-07-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022120220/http://geocities.com/noelcox/New_Zealands_Monarchy.htm|archivedate=2009-10-22}}</ref>

In 1999 the Republican Coalition relaunched itself as the Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand, similar to the [[Australian Republican Movement]], due to the [[1999 Australian republic referendum]], and again renamed itself in 2014 as New Zealand Republic.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holden |first1=Lewis J. |title=The New Zealand Republic Handbook: A Guide to Creating the New Zealand Republic |date=2009 |publisher=Republican Movement |isbn=978-0-473-15257-4 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_yPI1s4MZMC&pg=PA42 }}</ref>

==The debate==

===Arguments for change===
Supporters of a New Zealand republic have said:
*New Zealand should have a New Zealander, or more correctly a New Zealand citizen resident in New Zealand, as its [[head of state]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/35255/new_zealanders_dismiss_becoming_a_republic|title=New Zealanders Dismiss Becoming A Republic|publisher=Angus Reid Global Monitor}}</ref> a "resident for President";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/20100217|title=Nine to Noon&nbsp;– interview with Dean Knight|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=17 February 2010}}</ref>
*New Zealand needs to assert its independence, nationhood and maturity to the world;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://executive.govt.nz/96-99/minister/morris/youth-parliament/hansard/tuesday5.htm|title=Anna Davidson, Speech to Youth Parliament, 1999}}</ref>
*New Zealand's constitution—and indeed the attitudes of New Zealanders—are republican in their outlook.<ref name="colinjames">{{cite web|author=Colin James |title=The New Zealand Herald, 19&nbsp;February 2002 |url=http://www.colinjames.co.nz/herald/Herald_2002/Herald_column_02Feb19.htm |author-link=Colin James (journalist) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606010738/http://www.colinjames.co.nz/herald/Herald_2002/Herald_column_02Feb19.htm |archivedate=6 June 2002 }}</ref>
*New Zealand already maintains the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]]—who is described as a "virtual head of state".<ref name="Governors">{{Cite journal|title=The Governors|author=Gavin McLean|page=50|publisher=Otago University Press|year=2006 |author-link=Gavin McLean}}</ref> The Governor-General is a New Zealander and does everything the head of state should do;
*Because the Governor-General and Sovereign have little real power, they are not an effective check on the Parliamentary executive (the Prime Minister and Cabinet), the argument that the Sovereign or Governor-General "denies power" to politicians and is politically neutral yet can fire a Prime Minister is contradictory;<ref name="fischer">{{cite news|url=http://www.republican.co.nz/Empire%20Strikes%20Back.html|title=Empire Strikes Back|date=19 August 2010|author=Geoff Fischer|work=The Republican}}</ref>
*An elected or appointed head of state would be a more effective check on the executive;
*A Republic does not necessarily mean withdrawing from the commonwealth. Thirty-two of the 53 commonwealth member nations (60 per cent) are republics.
*The [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] should not have the power to dismiss the Governor-General at will and vice versa.{{sfn|Holden|2009|p=23}}

Other republicans have focused on the principles of a monarchy: many disagree with the [[Inheritance|hereditary]] principle (based on a form of [[primogeniture]]) that determines [[Succession to the British throne|succession of the throne]]. They argue that in a modern and democratic society no one should be expected to defer to another simply because of their birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/The%20Case%20for%20a%20Republic/index.php|title=The case for a republic|publisher=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]|accessdate=27 December 2016}}</ref> Some assert that the hereditary monarch and unelected Governor-General have no mandate to dismiss an elected government.<ref>{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Cunningham|url=http://salient.org.nz/2010/03/royal-retreat-or-sovereign-sanctuary-the-monarchy-versus-republic-debate-in-new-zealand/|title=Royal retreat or sovereign sanctuary?

At the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] of October 2011, the leaders of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s agreed that they would support change to their respective succession laws regarding male primogeniture, and allow the monarch to marry a Roman Catholic. The ban on Catholics from being the monarch would remain, because the monarch has to be in "Communion with the [[Church of England]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607|title=Girls equal in British throne succession|date=28 October 2011|accessdate=28 November 2011|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

===Arguments against change===
Supporters of the [[monarchy in New Zealand]] have said:
*"Constitutional monarchy is tried and proven system of government, some of the most politically stable nations in the world are constitutional monarchies; whereas some of the most unstable and repressive regimes have been republics."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monarchy.org.nz/|title=Monarchy New Zealand - Monarchy for the 21st Century|accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref> In the words of former Governor-General Sir [[Michael Hardie Boys]] "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".<ref name="ggsupport">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3610094| author=Jonathan Milne| title= Ditch Queen, say former Governors-General: New Zealand Herald | accessdate=2010-08-02| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| date=14 November 2004}}</ref>

===Cost===
Supporters of the monarchy have argued that it costs New Zealand taxpayers only a small outlay for royal engagements and tours, and the modest expenses of the Governor-General's establishment. They state "[t]his figure is about one dollar per person per year", about $4.3 million per annum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monarchy.org.nz/cost.html|title=Cost of the Monarchy|publisher=Monarchy New Zealand|year=2009|accessdate=2010-09-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204044924/http://www.monarchy.org.nz/cost.html|archivedate=4 December 2010}}</ref> An analysis by New Zealand Republic in 2010 claimed the office of Governor-General cost New Zealand taxpayers about $7.6 million in ongoing costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.nz/defendingthemonarchy#cost|title=Defending the monarchy - the cost|publisher=[[New Zealand Republic]]|year=2010|accessdate=2010-09-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501025508/http://www.republic.org.nz/defendingthemonarchy#cost|archivedate=1 May 2010}}</ref> They compared this cost to the [[President of Ireland]], a head of state of a country with a similar population size, who cost €3.4 million – NZ$6 million on the exchange rate at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1005/S00221.htm|title=Governor-General more expensive|date=20 May 2010|publisher=[[Scoop.co.nz]]|author=New Zealand Republic}}</ref> However, Monarchy New Zealand accused the republic supporters of arbitrarily inflating the costs on the Governor-General, pointing out the Irish President's cost was closer to NZ$12.8 million once the extra costs were included.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.monarchy.org.nz/images/documents/press/28%20October%202010.pdf |title= MONARCHY NEW ZEALAND CALLS FOR RESIGNATION OF REPUBLICAN CHAIR |publisher=Monarchy New Zealand |date= 28 October 2010 |accessdate= 19 July 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722215545/http://www.monarchy.org.nz/images/documents/press/28%20October%202010.pdf |archivedate= 22 July 2011}}</ref>

==Public opinion==
{{As of|2010|}}, the New Zealand public were generally in favour of the retention of the monarchy, with polls showing it to have between 50 and 70 per cent support.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.nzes.org|title=NZES data, 1990 - 2008|publisher=New Zealand Election Study|accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> Polls indicate that many New Zealanders see the monarchy as being of little day-to-day relevance; a [[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] [[Colmar Brunton]] poll in 2002 found that 58 per cent of the population believed the monarchy has little or no relevance to their lives.<ref>{{Cite news| title=NZ premier denies royal snub| publisher=BBC| date=23 February 2002| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1837083.stm| accessdate=16 June 2008}}</ref> ''[[National Business Review]]'' poll in 2004 found 57 per cent of respondents believed New Zealand would become a republic "in the future".<ref>{{cite news|date=17 August 2004|title=New Zealanders Resigned to Their Fate|work=[[National Business Review]]}}</ref>

However, the institution still enjoys the support of New Zealanders, particularly those born before [[World War II]].

Then-Deputy Prime Minister [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]], however, declared that he supported the monarchy, stating in 2004 he was "a sort of token monarchist in the Cabinet these days."<ref name="quotecullen">{{cite book|publisher=Clerk of the House of Representatives| title= Daily Hansard: Clerk of the House of Representatives|date=16 December 2004}}</ref> However, in 2010 he repudiated that stance, taking the view that New Zealand should move towards a republic once the Queen's reign ends.<ref name="cullen_2">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10669598|title=Cullen: New Zealand should be republic|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald#Herald on Sunday|Herald on Sunday]]|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> Former Prime Minister [[David Lange]] expressed support for a New Zealand republic, stating: "Do such things matter?

====National====
[[New Zealand National Party|National]]'s constitution specifies that the Party's visions and values include "Loyalty to our country, its democratic principles and our Sovereign as Head of State". In 2001 a constitutional policy task force recommended a referendum on the monarchy once the Queen's reign ends, along with referendums on the future of the [[Maori seats]] and the number of MPs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/425825/37476|title=National to debate policy proposals|publisher=[[TVNZ]]|date=23 April 2001}}</ref> Only the policy on Maori seats was passed by the party's regional conferences. Former MPs [[John Carter (New Zealand politician)|John Carter]], and [[Wayne Mapp]] and [[Richard Worth]] have been among the most vocal supporters of the monarchy within the party. At the 2011 elections, former Chair of [[Monarchy New Zealand]] [[Simon O'Connor]] was elected as MP for Tamaki and his Deputy [[Paul Foster-Bell]] was later elected a List MP in 2013 and both were re-elected at the 2014 election. At the 2014 election the former Chair of New Zealand Republic, Lewis Holden, was nominated as candidate for the Rimutaka electorate but failed to enter Parliament with incumbent Labour MP [[Chris Hipkins]] retaining the electorate, and Holden holding a list ranking too low (at 66 on the National list) to enter parliament. Among the 2014 caucus of new National Members of Parliament, a number of portraits of the Queen have been placed in their Wellington offices through an initiative led by Monarchy New Zealand. Former Prime Minister [[John Key]] has said he was "not convinced it [a republic] will be a big issue in the short term",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/1866364|title=Strong backing for MMP referendum|publisher=[[TVNZ]]|date=23 June 2008|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref> but that he thinks a republic is "inevitable"; however, since this statement he has affirmed his support for the monarchy and made it clear that while he was prime minister a republic would not happen "on his watch".<ref name="johnkey2">{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4cc53226-77bc-11dd-be24-0000779fd18c.html?nclick_check=1|title=Key knocking on door of government|date=1 September 2008|work=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=2008-09-04}}</ref>

====Green====
Support for a republic is strongest amongst the supporters of the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]], and it is party policy to support a "democratic and participatory process, such as referenda".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greens.org.nz/policy/constitutional-reform|title=Full Policy - Constitutional Reform|publisher=[[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]]|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref> Former Green MP [[Keith Locke]] had a [[member's bill]] drawn on the issue, the Head of State Referenda Bill, for a referendum on the issue, but it was voted down at its first reading in parliament in 2009.<ref>{{citation| last=House of Representatives| title=Order Paper| date=15 October 2009| volume=71| publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)]]}}</ref>

====Minor parties====
During a debate for the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 election]], [[John Tamihere]] of the [[Māori Party]] voiced support for New Zealand to become a republic after [[Queen Elizabeth II]] dies, saying "it's about time". [[Winston Peters]] of [[New Zealand First]] stated that the question of a republic should be resolved through a two-step referendum.<ref>{{cite news|title=John Tamihere wants New Zealand to become a republic once the Queen dies|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/john-tamihere-wants-new-zealand-become-republic-once-queen-dies-v1|work=1 News|publisher=TVNZ|date=2020-10-08|accessdate=2020-10-10}}</ref>

Former [[United Future New Zealand]] leader [[Peter Dunne]] is a supporter of a New Zealand republic. The party has a policy of "a public education process on constitutional matters, leading towards consideration of New Zealand as a republic within the Commonwealth in the future."<ref name="ufnz_policy">{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedfuture.org.nz/default,75,constitution.sm|title=United Future New Zealand - Constitution Policy|publisher=[[United Future New Zealand]]|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref>

===Governors-General===
In 2004 former Governor-General Dame [[Catherine Tizard]] said publicly that the monarch should be replaced by a New Zealand head of state. Her predecessor as Governor-General, Sir [[Paul Reeves]], has stated that he would not oppose a republic. Sir Michael Hardie Boys has supported the status quo.<ref name="ggsupport" /> On 29 July 2006, outgoing Governor-General Dame [[Silvia Cartwright]] stated she had no views as to whether New Zealand becomes a republic, noting: "We often overlook the intense loyalty and love the Māori people have for the Queen - probably more intense than many people of European descent. This is a history that's never going to die."<ref name="cartquote">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10393582| author= Carroll du Chateau | title= Dame Silvia Cartwright's majestic presence: New Zealand Herald | accessdate=2006-09-11| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| date=29 July 2006}}</ref>

==Constitutional issues==
New Zealand is a [[unitary state]] and does not have a [[Codification (law)|codified]], entrenched constitution. Some have argued New Zealand is a "de facto" republic.<ref name="clarkrepublic" /><ref name="hos_first_reading">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/mi-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/0/1/7/49HansD_20100421_00001343-Head-of-State-Referenda-Bill-First-Reading.htm|title=Head of State Referenda Bill – First Reading|date=21 April 2010|publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]]}}</ref> New Zealand has made constitutional changes without difficulty in the past, such as the abolition of its [[New Zealand Legislative Council#Abolition|upper house of parliament]] in 1951, the introduction of [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|proportional representation]] in 1996 and most recently the creation of the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand]] as the court of final appeal.

===The Treaty of Waitangi===
{{main|Treaty of Waitangi}}
The [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was an agreement signed between [[Iwi|Māori tribe]]s and representatives of the British Crown in 1840. Because of the relationship between Māori and the Crown, the Treaty of Waitangi is often cited as a constitutional issue for a New Zealand republic.<ref name="jb_rnz" /> Some academics expressed concern that governments could use republicanism to evade treaty responsibilities.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Republicanism in New Zealand| last=Tunks| first=Andrea| editor-last=Trainor| editor-first=Luke| page=117| publisher=Dunmore Press| location=Palmerston North| isbn=978-0-86469-256-6| year=1996}}</ref> However, with the division of the Crown between the United Kingdom and New Zealand following the passing of the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947]],{{sfn|Quentin-Baxter & McLean|2017|p=65}} the "Crown in Right of New Zealand" became party to the Treaty.{{sfn|Quentin-Baxter & McLean|2017|p=333}} Legal academics state that the Treaty would be unaffected by New Zealand becoming a republic, as the new head of state would inherit the Crown's responsibilities. In 2004, Professor Noel Cox argued "In strict legal terms, if New Zealand became a republic tomorrow it would make no difference to the Treaty of Waitangi. Speaking as a lawyer, it's a long-established principle that successive governments take on responsibility for previous agreements."<ref name="cox_treaty">{{cite news|title=The People vs the Crown|author=Jonathan Milne|work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]]|date=30 May 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLawJl/1998/11.html|title="Of Conventions and Constitutional Change: Lessons for New Zealand" [1998] UNSWLawJl 11; (1998) 21(3) University of New South Wales Law Journal 936|publisher=University of New South Wales Law Journal|author=Dr Andrew Stockley|year=1998|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105203212/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLawJl/1998/11.html|archivedate=5 November 2012}}</ref>

===Realm of New Zealand===
The [[Realm of New Zealand]] consists of New Zealand proper and two states in free association, [[Niue]] and the [[Cook Islands]]. Should New Zealand become a republic, the Realm of New Zealand would continue to exist without New Zealand, the Ross Dependency and [[Tokelau]].<ref name="dominion_status">{{cite book|author=David McIntyre|title= The Strange Death of Dominion Status|publisher=Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History|year=1999|pages= 193, 196}}</ref> This would not be a legal hurdle to a New Zealand republic,<ref name="realm_status">{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/journals/VUWLRev/2003/34.html |title=The Strange Death of the Realm of New Zealand: The Implications of a New Zealand Republic for the Cook Islands and Niue by Andrew Townend (2003) VUWLRev 34 |accessdate=2006-12-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426092605/http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/journals/VUWLRev/2003/34.html |archivedate=26 April 2009}}</ref> and both the Cook Islands and Niue would retain their status as associated states with New Zealand, as New Zealand shares its head of state with the Cook Islands and Niue in the same way the United Kingdom shares its head of state with the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s.

==Commonwealth membership==
{{See also|Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations}}
If New Zealand became a republic its membership of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] would be unaffected. Since the creation of the modern Commonwealth in 1949, republics are able to be members of the Commonwealth, recognising the Queen as [[Head of the Commonwealth]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=James|title=Most Commonwealth countries are already republics|url=https://www.republic.org.uk/what-we-want/facts/most-commonwealth-countries-are-already-republics|publisher=Republic|accessdate=27 December 2016|date=15 March 2019}}</ref> Following the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2007]], the Kampala Communiqué stated "Heads of Government also agreed that, where an existing member changes its formal constitutional status, it should not have to reapply for Commonwealth membership provided that it continues to meet all the criteria for membership."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ituc-csi.org/IMG/pdf/CHOGM_2007_Communique.pdf|title=Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting Kampala, Uganda|publisher=[[International Trade Union Confederation]]|date=23-25 November 2007|accessdate=15 March 2019}}</ref>

==Recent developments==

===Constitutional Inquiry===
{{Main|Constitution of New Zealand#Constitutional Arrangements Committee}}
In November 2004, Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] announced the formation of a parliamentary committee of inquiry into the constitution, chaired by [[United Future New Zealand]] leader [[Peter Dunne]]. In its final report, the committee recommended wider education on the constitution and included a note on the republic issue, asking "Is the nature of New Zealand's head of state, as a monarch, appropriate to New Zealand's evolving national and constitutional identity?".<ref name="constinqconc">{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/files/constitutional_review_2005.pdf|title=Final Report of the Constitutional Inquiry|date=11 August 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514164545/http://www.elections.org.nz/files/constitutional_review_2005.pdf|archivedate=14 May 2010}}</ref>

===Head of State Referenda Bill===
{{Wikisource|Head of state (Referenda) Bill}}
[[Keith Locke]]'s Head of State Referenda Bill for a referendum on the republic issue was drawn from the members' ballot and introduced into Parliament on 14 October 2009.<ref name="order_paper">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/7B3B73E3-47FC-456C-83D3-8BA19D6A5BAC/115528/00HOH20091015_orderpaper1.pdf|date=15 October 2009|title=Parliament of New Zealand Order Paper, Thursday 15 October 2009}}</ref> The bill focused on reforming the [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] as a ceremonial head of state, creating a [[parliamentary republic]].<ref name="nzh_republic_bill">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=940393|title=Republic Bill near|accessdate=2007-09-19|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=NZPA|date=21 February 2002|author-link=NZPA}}</ref> Two models of a republic along with the status quo would have been put to a referendum:
