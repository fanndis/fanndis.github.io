The '''Hopi''' are a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribe]] who primarily live on the [[Hopi Reservation]] in northeastern [[Arizona]]. As of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], there are 19,338<!-- infobox says 18,327--> Hopi in the United States.<ref name="census">{{Cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_AIAN_AIANDP1&prodType=table|title=American FactFinder - Results|first=U.

Particular villages retain autonomy under the Hopi Constitution and Bylaws. The [[Hopi language]] is one of 30 in the [[Uto-Aztecan language]] family. The majority of Hopi people are enrolled in the '''Hopi Tribe of Arizona''' but some are enrolled in the [[Colorado River Indian Tribes]]. The [[Hopi Reservation]] covers a land area of {{convert|2,531.773|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.

The Hopi encountered Spaniards in the 16th century, and are historically referred to as [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo people]], because they lived in villages (''pueblos'' in the Spanish language). The Hopi are descended from the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] ([[Hopi language|Hopi]]: ''Hisatsinom''), who constructed large apartment-house complexes and had an advanced culture that spanned the present-day [[Four Corners]] region of the United States, comprising southeastern [[Utah]], northeastern [[Arizona]], northwestern [[New Mexico]], and southwestern [[Colorado]].<ref name=eb>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22804/Ancestral-Pueblo-culture "Ancestral Pueblo culture."] ''Encyclopædia Britannica.'' Retrieved 4 June 2012.</ref> They lived along the [[Mogollon Rim]], especially from the 12th–14th century, after which time their cultures seemed to have disappeared.

The primary meaning of the word "Hopi" is "behaving one, one who is mannered, civilized, peaceable, polite, who adheres to the Hopi Way."<ref name="auto1">{{Citation | author = The Hopi Dictionary Project, Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology, University of Arizona | title = Hopi Dictionary / ''Hopìikwa Lavàytutuveni'': A Hopi-English Dictionary of the Third Mesa Dialect | place = Tucson | publisher = Univ. of Arizona Pr. | year = 1998 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/hopidictionaryho0000unse/page/99 99–100] | isbn = 0-8165-1789-4 | url = https://archive.org/details/hopidictionaryho0000unse/page/99 }}</ref> Some sources contrast this to other warring tribes that subsist on plunder.<ref name="auto2">Connelly, John C., "Hopi Social Organization."

''Hopi'' is a concept deeply rooted in the culture's religion, spirituality, and its view of morality and ethics. To be Hopi is to strive toward this concept, which involves a state of total reverence and respect for all things, to be at peace with these things, and to live in accordance with the instructions of ''[[Maasaw]]'', the Creator or Caretaker of Earth. The Hopi observe their traditional ceremonies for the benefit of the entire world.

Traditionally, Hopi are organized into [[matrilineal]] clans. The children are born into the same clan structure as the mother. These clan organizations extend across all villages.  Children are named by the women of the father's clan. After the child is introduced to the Sun, the women of the paternal clan gather, and name the child in honor of the father's clan. Children can be given over forty names. The village members decide the common name. Current practice is to either use a non-Hopi or English name or the parent's chosen Hopi name. A person may also change the name upon initiation to traditional religious societies, or a major life event.

Prehistoric architecture dictates how social structures influence the creation of homes before European contact. Many Hopi homes were created with [[Pueblo]] influence as well. Archeological digs have uncovered various room structures reflecting social practices of the Hopi people during this period. During the 1970s, a group of archeologists assembled a few basic types of rooms used in prehistoric Hopi life: living/ habitation rooms, storage rooms, and religious/ ceremonial rooms ([[Kiva|see kivas]]); each of these rooms allowed for the Hopi to hold ceremonies, cook, and even forge hunting equipment. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=E. Charles|date=January 1983|title=The Architectural Analogue to Hopi Social Organization and Room Use, and Implications for Prehistoric Northern Southwestern Culture|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/279817|journal=American Antiquity|volume=48|issue=1|pages=44–61|doi=10.2307/279817|jstor=279817|issn=0002-7316}}</ref>

The Hopi have always viewed their land as sacred, seeing themselves as caretakers of the land that they inherited from their ancestors.  The Hopi did not have a conception of land being bounded and divided. Agriculture is a very important part of their culture, and their villages are now located atop mesas in northern [[Arizona]]. The Hopi people originally settled near the foot of the mesas but in the course of the 17th century moved to the mesa tops for protection from the Utes, Apaches, and Spanish.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Fewkes | first = Jesse Walter | author-link = Jesse Walter Fewkes | date = 1900 | title = Tusayan Migration Traditions | series = 19th Annual report of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution | publisher = U.

On December 16, 1882, [[Chester A. Arthur|President Chester A. Arthur]] passed an executive order creating a reservation for the Hopi. It was smaller than the surrounding land that was annexed by the [[Navajo reservation]], which is the largest in the country.<ref name="Whiteley, Peter M. 1988" />

On October 24, 1936, the Hopi people ratified a Constitution. That Constitution created a [[Unicameralism|unicameral government]] where all powers are vested in a Tribal Council. While there is an executive branch (tribal chairman and vice chairman) and judicial branch, their powers are limited under the Hopi Constitution. The traditional powers and authority of the Hopi Villages were preserved in the 1936 Constitution.<ref name="auto3">Justin B. Richland,  Arguing With Tradition, (University of Chicago Press, 2004) 35.</ref>

Today, the Hopi Reservation is entirely surrounded by the much larger [[Navajo Reservation]]. The two nations used to share the ''Navajo–Hopi Joint Use Area'', but this was a source of conflict. The partition of this area, commonly known as [[Big Mountain, Arizona|Big Mountain]], by Acts of Congress in 1974 and 1996, has also resulted in long-term controversy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kstrom.net/isk/maps/az/navhopi.html|title=NAVAJO - HOPI Land Dispute, history, maps, links|website=www.kstrom.net|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Navajo-Hopi Land Issue: A Chronology |url=http://www.nau.edu/~hcpo-p/current/Chronology.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530212923/http://www.nau.edu/~hcpo-p/current/Chronology.html |archive-date=2008-05-30}}</ref>

==Oraibi==

Old [[Oraibi]] is one of four original Hopi villages, and one of the oldest continuously inhabited villages within the territory of the United States. In the 1540s the village was recorded as having 1,500–3,000 residents.<ref name="Whiteley, Peter M. 1988">Whiteley, Peter M. ''Deliberate Acts'', Tucson, AZ: The University of Arizona Press, 1988: 14–86.</ref>

==Early European contact, 1540–1680==

The first recorded [[Europe]]an contact with the Hopi was by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in A.D 1540. Spanish General [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]] went to North America to explore the land. While at the [[Zuni people|Zuni]] villages, he learned of the Hopi tribe. Coronado dispatched Pedro de Tovar and other members of their party to find the Hopi villages.<ref name="Brew, J.O. 1850">Brew, J.O. "Hopi Prehistory and History to 1850." In Alonso Ortiz, vol. ed., ''Southwest'', vol. 9, in William C. Sturtevant, gnl. ed., ''Handbook of North American Indians'', Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1979: 514–523.</ref> The Spanish wrote that the first Hopi village they visited was ''[[Awatovi Ruins|Awatovi]]''. They noted that there were about 16,000 Hopi and Zuni people.<ref name="Whiteley, Peter M. 1988" />  A few years later, the Spanish explorer [[García López de Cárdenas]] investigated the [[Rio Grande]] and met the Hopi. They warmly entertained Cardenas and his men and directed him on his journey.<ref name="Brew, J.O. 1850" />

In 1582–1583 the Hopi were visited by [[Antonio de Espejo]]’s expedition. He noted that there were five Hopi villages and around 12,000 Hopi people.<ref name="Whiteley, Peter M. 1988" />  During that period the Spanish explored and colonized the southwestern region of the New World, but never sent many forces or settlers to the Hopi country.<ref name="Brew, J.O. 1850" />  Their visits to the Hopi were random and spread out over many years. Many times the visits were from military explorations.

The Spanish colonized near the Rio Grande and, because the Hopi did not live near rivers that gave access to the Rio Grande, the Spanish never left any troops on their land.<ref name="ReferenceA">Clemmer, Richard O. ''Roads in the Sky'', Boulder, Colorado.: Westview Press, Inc., 1995: 30–90.</ref> The Spanish were accompanied by [[missionaries]], [[Catholic]] friars. Beginning in 1629, with the arrival of 30 friars in Hopi country, the Franciscan Period started.  The Franciscans had missionaries assigned and built a church at Awatovi.

==Pueblo Revolt of 1680==

{{Main|Pueblo Revolt}}
Spanish Roman Catholic priests were only marginally successful in converting the Hopi and persecuted them in a draconian manner for adhering to Hopi religious practices. The Spanish occupiers in effect enslaved the Hopi populace, compelling them to endure forced labor and hand over goods and crops.    Spanish oppression and attempts to convert the Hopi caused the Hopi over time to become increasingly intolerant towards their occupiers.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> The documentary record shows evidence of Spanish abuses. In 1655, a Franciscan priest by the name of Salvador de Guerra beat to death a Hopi man named Juan Cuna. As punishment, Guerra was removed from his post on the Hopi mesas and sent to Mexico City.<ref>Scholes, France V. ''Troublous Times in New Mexico, 1659-1670''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1942.  1942</ref> In 1656, a young Hopi man by the name of Juan Suñi was sent to Santa Fe as an indentured servant because he impersonated the resident priest Alonso de Posada at Awatovi, an act believed to have been carried out in the spirit of Hopi clowning.<ref>Daughters, Anton. "A Seventeenth-Century Instance of Hopi Clowning?" ''Kiva'' 74:4 (Summer 2009) 2009</ref> During the period of Franciscan missionary presence (1629-1680), the only significant conversions took place at the pueblo of [[Awatovi Ruins|Awatovi]].<ref name="Brew, J.O. 1850" /> In the 1670s, the Rio Grande [[Pueblo]] Indians put forward the suggestion to revolt in 1680 and garnered Hopi support.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

The Pueblo Revolt was the first time that diverse Pueblo groups had worked in unison to drive out the Spanish colonists. In the Burning of Awatovi, Spanish soldiers, local Catholic Church missionaries, friars, and priests were all put to death, and the churches and mission buildings were dismantled stone by stone.  It took two decades for the Spanish to reassert their control over the Rio Grande Pueblos but the Catholic Inquisition never made it back to Hopiland. In 1700, the Spanish friars had begun rebuilding a smaller church at Awatovi.  During the winter of 1700–01, selected teams of men from the other Hopi villages sacked [[Awatovi Ruins|Awatovi]] at the request of the village chief, killed all the men of the village, and removed the women and children to other Hopi villages, then completely destroyed the village and burned it to the ground.  Thereafter, despite intermittent attempts in the course of the 18th century, the Spanish failed subsequently to ever re-establish a presence in Hopi country.<ref name="Brew, J.O. 1850" />

== Hopi-U.S relations, 1849–1946 ==

[[Image:Ceramic Hopi jar - by-Nampeyo - date-ca. 1880 - from-DC1.jpg|thumb|[[Nampeyo]] ''Ceramic jar,'' circa 1880]]
In 1849, [[James S. Calhoun]] was appointed official [[Indian agent]] of [[Indian Affairs]] for the Southwest Territory of the U.S. He had headquarters in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and was responsible for all of the Indian residents of the area. The first formal meeting between the Hopi and the U.S government occurred in 1850 when seven Hopi leaders made the trip to Santa Fe to meet with Calhoun. They wanted the government to provide protection against the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], an [[Apachean]]-language tribe, but distinct from other Apache. At this time, the Hopi leader was ''Nakwaiyamtewa''.

The US established [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]] in 1851 in [[Arizona]], and placed troops in Navajo country to deal with their threats to the Hopi. General James J. Carleton, with the assistance of [[Kit Carson]], was assigned to travel through the area. They "captured" the Navajo natives and forced them to the fort. As a result of the [[Long Walk of the Navajo]], the Hopi enjoyed a short period of peace.<ref name="Dockstader, Frederick J. 1940">Dockstader, Frederick J. "Hopi History, 1850–1940." In Alonso Ortiz, vol. ed., Southwest, vol. 9, in William C. Sturtevant, gnl. ed., ''Handbook of North American Indians''. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1979: 524–532.</ref>

In 1847, [[Mormons]] settled in [[Utah]] and tried to convert the Indians to Mormonism.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> [[Jacob Hamblin]], a Mormon missionary, first made a trip into Hopi country in 1858. He was on good terms with the Hopi Indians, and in 1875 an [[LDS Church]] was built on Hopi land.<ref name="Dockstader, Frederick J. 1940" />

===Education===

In 1875, the English trader Thomas Keam escorted Hopi leaders to meet President [[Chester A. Arthur]] in [[Washington D.C.]] ''Loololma,'' village chief of [[Oraibi]] at the time, was very impressed with Washington.<ref name="Whiteley, Peter M. 1988" />  In 1887, a federal boarding school was established at [[Keams Canyon]] for Hopi children.<ref name="Dockstader, Frederick J. 1940" />

The Oraibi people did not support the school and refused to send their children {{convert|35|mi|km}} from their villages. The Keams Canyon School was organized to teach the Hopi youth the ways of European-American civilization. It forced them to use English and give up their traditional ways.<ref name="Whiteley, Peter M. 1988" /> The children were made to abandon their tribal identity and completely take on European-American culture.<ref>Pecina, Ron and Pecina, Bob. ''Neil David's Hopi World''. Schiffer Publishing Ltd., 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-7643-3808-3}}</ref>  Children were forced to give up their traditional names, clothing and language. Boys, who were also forced to cut their long hair, were taught European farming and carpentry skills. Girls were taught ironing, sewing and "civilized" dining. The school also reinforced European-American religions. The [[American Baptist Home Mission Society]] made students attend services every morning and religious teachings during the week.<ref>Adams, David Wallace. "Schooling the Hopi: Federal Indian Policy Writ Small, 1887–1917", ''The Pacific Historical Review,'' Vol. 48, No. 3. University of California Press, (1979): 335–356.</ref> In 1890, Commissioner of [[Indian Affairs]] Thomas Jefferson Morgan arrived in Hopi country with other government officials to review the progress of the new school. Seeing that few students were enrolled, they returned with federal troops who threatened to arrest the Hopi parents who refused to send their children to school, with Morgan forcibly taking children to fill the school.<ref name="Whiteley, Peter M. 1988" />

===Hopi land===

Agriculture is an important part of Hopi culture, and their villages are spread out across the northern part of [[Arizona]]. The Hopi and the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] did not have a conception of land being bounded and divided. The Hopi people had settled in permanent villages, while the nomadic Navajo people moved around the four corners. Both lived on the land that their ancestors did. On December 16, 1882, [[President Chester A. Arthur]] passed an executive order creating a reservation for the Hopi. It was smaller than the [[Navajo reservation]], which was the largest in the country.<ref name="Whiteley, Peter M. 1988" />

The [[Hopi reservation]] was originally a rectangle 55 by 70 miles (88.5 by 110&nbsp;km) in the middle of the [[Navajo Reservation]], with their village lands taking about half of the land.<ref name="Johansson, S. Ryan 1978">Johansson, S. Ryan., and Preston, S.H. "Tribal Demography: The Hopi and Navaho Populations as Seen through Manuscripts from the 1900 U.S Census", ''Social Science History,'' Vol. 3, No. 1. Duke University Press, (1978): 1–33.</ref>  The reservation prevented encroachment by white settlers, but it did not protect the Hopis against the [[Navajos]].<ref name="Whiteley, Peter M. 1988" />

The Hopi and the Navajo fought over land, and they had different models of sustainability, as the Navajo were sheepherders. Eventually the Hopi went before the Senate Committee of Interior and Insular Affairs to ask them to help provide a solution to the dispute. The tribes argued over approximately {{convert|1800000|acre|km2}} of land in northern Arizona.<ref>United States Congress, Senate, Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. ''Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute: Hearing before the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 1974'', Washington DC: U.S Government Printing Office, (1974): 1–3.</ref> In 1887 the U.S government passed the [[Dawes Allotment Act]]. The purpose was to divide up communal tribal land into individual allotments by household, to encourage a model of European-American style subsistence farming on individually owned family plots of {{convert|640|acre|km2}} or less. The Department of Interior would declare remaining land "surplus" to the tribe's needs and make it available for purchase by U.S citizens. For the Hopi, the Act would destroy their ability to farm, their main means of income. The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] did not set up land allotments in the Southwest.<ref name="hopieducationfund.org">[http://www.hopieducationfund.org/partners.html Hopi Education Endowment Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011060917/http://www.hopieducationfund.org/partners.html |date=2009-10-11 }}.

===Oraibi split===

[[File:Oraibi1.jpg|thumb|Abandoned house and view from Oraibi village|alt=]]

The chief of the Oraibi, Lololoma, enthusiastically supported Hopi education, but his people were divided on this issue.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Talayesva|first1=Don. C.|title=Sun Chief: The Autobiography of a Hopi Indian|date=1970|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-19103-5|page=93|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3dg_AQAAQBAJ&q=978-0-300-19103-5&pg=PR4}}</ref> Most of the village was conservative and refused to allow their children to attend school. These natives were referred to as "hostiles" because they opposed the American government and its attempts to force assimilation. The rest of the Oraibi were called "friendlies" because of their acceptance of white people and culture. The "hostiles"  refused to let their children attend school. In 1893, the Oraibi Day School was opened in the Oraibi village. Although the school was in the village, traditional parents still refused to allow their children to attend.

In 1894, a group of Hopi parents announced that they were against the ideas of Washington and did not want their children to be exposed to the culture of white Americans. The government sent troops to arrest the 19 parents and sent them to [[Alcatraz Prison]], where they stayed for a year.<ref name="Whiteley, Peter M. 1988" />  Another Oraibi leader, ''Lomahongyoma'', competed with ''Lololoma'' for village leadership. In 1906 the village split after a conflict between hostiles and friendlies. The conservative hostiles left and formed a new village, known as ''[[Hotevilla-Bacavi, Arizona|Hotevilla]]''.<ref name="Dockstader, Frederick J. 1940" />

==Hopi recognition==

At the dawn of the 20th century, the US government established day schools, missions, farming bureaus, and clinics on every Indian reservation. This policy required that every reservation set up its own police force, tribal courts, and appoint a leader who would represent their tribe to the U.S government. In 1910 in the Census for Indians, the Hopi Tribe had a total of 2,000 members, which was the highest in 20 years. The [[Navajo people|Navajo]] at this time had 22,500 members and have consistently increased in population. During the early years of this century, only about three percent of Hopis lived off the reservation.<ref name="Johansson, S. Ryan 1978" />  In 1924 Congress officially declared [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans]] to be U.S citizens with the [[Indian Citizenship Act]].

Under the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, the Hopi established a constitution to create their own tribal government, and in 1936 elected a Tribal Council.<ref name="Dockstader, Frederick J. 1940" />  The Preamble to the Hopi constitution states that they are a self-governing tribe, focused on working together for peace and agreements between villages in order to preserve the "good things of Hopi life." The constitution consists of thirteen articles, addressing territory, membership, and organization of their government with [[legislative]], [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial branch]]es.<ref>[http://www.tribalresourcecenter.org/ccfolder/hopi_const.htm "Constitution of the Hopi Tribe"], National Tribal Justice Resource Center's Tribal Codes and Constitutions.

==Hopi–Navajo land disputes==

{{further|Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation}}
From the 1940s to the 1970s, the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] moved their settlements closer to Hopi land, causing the Hopi to raise the issue with the U.S government. This resulted in the establishment of "District 6" which placed a boundary around the Hopi villages on the first, second, and third mesas, thinning the reservation to {{convert|501501|acre|km2}}.<ref name="Dockstader, Frederick J. 1940" />  In 1962 the courts issued the "Opinion, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Judgment," which stated that the U.S government did not grant the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] any type of permission to reside on the [[Hopi Reservation]] that was declared in 1882; and that the remaining Hopi land was to be shared with the Navajo (the [[Navajo–Hopi Joint Use Area]]).<ref name="nau.edu">Hopi Cultural Preservation Office. http://www8.nau.edu/~hcpo-p/. November 12, 2009.</ref>

Between 1961–1964, the Hopi tribal council signed leases with the U.S government that allowed companies to explore and drill for oil, gas, and minerals in Hopi country. This drilling brought over three million dollars to the Hopi Tribe.<ref name="Clemmer, Richard O. 1974">Clemmer, Richard O. "Hopi History, 1940–1974." In Alonso Ortiz, vol. ed., Southwest, vol. 9, in William C. Sturtevant, gen. ed., ''Handbook of North American Indians''.  Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1979: 533–538.</ref> In 1974, The [[Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act]] was passed. It created the [[Navajo-Hopi Indian Relocation Commission]], which forced the relocation of any Hopi or Navajo living on the other's land. In 1992, the Hopi Reservation was increased to {{convert|1500000|acre|km2}}.<ref name="nau.edu" />

Today's Hopi Reservation is traversed by [[Arizona State Route 264]], a paved road that links the numerous Hopi villages.

==Tribal government==

[[File:Flag of the Hopi Reservation.svg|left|thumb|Flag of the Hopi]]
On October 24, 1936, the Hopi people ratified a constitution. That constitution created a [[Unicameralism|unicameral government]] where all powers are vested in a Tribal Council. While there is an executive branch (tribal chairman and vice chairman) and judicial branch, their powers are limited under the Hopi Constitution. The traditional powers and authority of the Hopi villages was preserved in the 1936 constitution.<ref name="auto3" />

The Hopi tribe is federally recognized and headquartered in [[Kykotsmovi, Arizona]].

===Tribal officers===
The current tribal officers are:<ref name="hopi-nsn.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.hopi-nsn.gov/tribal-government/|title=Tribal Government|work=The Hopi Tribe}}</ref>

* Treasurer: Wilfred Gaseoma
* Sergeant-at-Arms: Alfonso Sakeva

===Tribal council===
Representatives to the council are selected either by a community election or by an appointment from the village kikmongwi, or leader. Each representative serves a two-year term. Representation on the Tribal Council as of December 2017 is as follows:<ref name="hopi-nsn.gov" />

'''Village of Upper Moenkopi:''' Robert Charley, Bruce Fredericks, LeRoy Shingoitewa

'''Village of Bakabi:''' Lamar Keevama, Davis Pecusa, Clifford Quotsaquahu

'''Village of Sipaulavi''':

'''Village of Mishongnovi''': Emma Anderson, Craig Andrews, Pansy K. Edmo, Rolanda Yoyletsdewa

'''First Mesa Consolidated Villages:''' Albert T. Sinquah, Wallace Youvella, Sr.

Currently, the villages of Shungopavi, Oraibi, Hotevilla, and Lower Moenkopi do not have a representative on council.<ref name="hopi-nsn.gov" /> The Hopi Villages select council representatives, and may decline to send any representative. The declination has been approved by the Hopi Courts.<ref>''In The Matter of Village Authority To Remove Tribal Council Representatives,'' Hopi Appellate Court, Appellate Court Case No. 2008-AP 0001</ref>

==Economic development==

{{Further|Hopi mythology}}
The ''Hopi Dictionary'' gives the primary meaning of the word "Hopi" as: "behaving one, one who is mannered, civilized, peaceable, polite, who adheres to the Hopi Way."<ref name="auto1"/> Some sources contrast this to other warring tribes that subsist on plunder,<ref name="auto2"/> considering their [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]], ''Hopisinom'' to mean "The Peaceful People" or "Peaceful Little Ones".<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbcomp.com/redman/hopi.htm |title=Hopi |publisher=Ausbcomp.com |accessdate=2013-02-17}}</ref>  However, Malotki maintains that "neither the notion 'peaceful' nor the idea 'little' are semantic ingredients of the term."<ref>{{ Citation | last = Malotki | first = Ekkehart | author-link = Ekkehart Malotki | date = 1991 | title = Language as a key to cultural understanding: New interpretations of Central Hopi concepts | journal = Baessler-Archiv | volume = 39 | pages = 43–75 }}</ref>

According to Barry Pritzker, "...many Hopi feel an intimate and immediate connection with their past. Indeed, for many Hopi, time does not proceed in a straight line, as most people understand it. Rather, the past may be past and present more or less simultaneously."  In the present Fourth World, the Hopi worship Masauwu, who admonished them to "always remember their gods and to live in the correct way."  The village leader, ''kikmongwi'', "promoted civic virtue and proper behavior."<ref name="bp">{{cite book |last1=Pritzker |first1=Barry |title=The Hopi |date=2011 |publisher=Chelsea House |location=New York |isbn=9781604137989 |pages=16–17, 25}}</ref>

Traditionally, Hopi are organized into [[matrilineal]] clans. When a man marries, the children from the relationship are members of his wife's clan. These clan organizations extend across all villages.  Children are named by the women of the father's clan. On the twentieth day of a baby's life, the women of the paternal clan gather, each woman bringing a name and a gift for the child. In some cases where many relatives would attend, a child could be given over forty names, for example. The child's parents generally decide the name to be used from these names. Current practice is to either use a non-Hopi or English name or the parent's chosen Hopi name. A person may also change the name upon initiation into one of the religious societies, such as the [[Kachina]] society, or with a major life event.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The Hopi practice a complete cycle of traditional ceremonies although not all villages retain or  had the complete ceremonial cycle. These ceremonies take place according to the [[lunar calendar]] and are observed in each of the Hopi villages. Like other Native American groups, the Hopi have been influenced by Christianity and the missionary work of several Christian denominations.  Few have converted enough to Christianity to drop their traditional religious practices.

Traditionally the Hopi are micro or subsistence farmers. The Hopi also are part of the wider cash economy; a significant number of Hopi have mainstream jobs; others earn a living by creating Hopi art, notably the carving of Kachina dolls, the crafting of earthenware ceramics, and the design and production of fine jewelry, especially sterling silver.

The Hopi collect and dry a native perennial plant called [[Thelesperma megapotamicum]], known by the common name Hopi tea, and use it to make an [[herbal tea]], as a medicinal remedy and a yellow dye.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medicinal Plants of the Southwest Thelesperma megapotamicum|url=http://medplant.nmsu.edu/thelesperma.shtm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509161539/http://medplant.nmsu.edu/thelesperma.shtm|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 May 2008|work=New Mexico State University|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>

==Albinism==
The Hopi have a high rate of [[albinism]]. Primarily in Second Mesa and west villages towards Hotevilla—about 1 in 200 individuals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hedrick|first1=Philip|title=Hopi Indians, "cultural" selection, and albinism|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=June 2003|volume=121|issue=2|pages=151–156|doi=10.1002/ajpa.10180|pmid=12740958}}</ref>
