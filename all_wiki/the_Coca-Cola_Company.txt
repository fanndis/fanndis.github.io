As of 2014, after purchasing the North American assets of [[Coca-Cola Enterprises]], the company directly owns 100% of Coca-Cola Refreshments, the anchor bottler of Coca-Cola products in North America, representing about 90% of Canada and 80% of the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Other major bottlers in the United States are:
* Coca-Cola Consolidated, based in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] (company owns 34.8%)
* [[Coca-Cola Beverages Northeast]] based in [[Bedford, New Hampshire]] and owned by Kirin Company
* [[Coca-Cola Bottling Company United]], based in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] (independent)
* [[Swire Group|Swire Coca-Cola USA]], based in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah and owned by Swire Group

In September 2015, the company announced the sale of several production plants and territories to Swire, Consolidated, and United, and creation of the Coca-Cola National Product Supply System which controls 95% of the territory in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/191463/cocacola-ko-to-sell-9-us-plants-to-independent-bottlers|title=Coca-Cola (KO) to Sell 9 US Plants to Independent Bottlers|date=December 7, 2015|work=Zacks Investment Research|access-date=September 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926080456/http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/191463/cocacola-ko-to-sell-9-us-plants-to-independent-bottlers|archive-date=September 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Consumer relations and civic involvement==
After [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] won the 1964 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], plans for an interracial celebratory dinner in still-[[segregated Atlanta]] were not initially well supported by the city's business elite until Coca-Cola intervened.<ref>{{cite news| newspaper=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | date=December 10, 2002 |title=NOBEL PEACE PRIZE: In 1964, award to King stirred a storm}}</ref>

==Criticism==

Since the early 2000s, the criticisms over the use of Coca-Cola products as well as the company itself, escalated with concerns over health effects, environmental issues, [[animal testing]], economic business practices and employee issues.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Nace|first=Trevor|title=Coca-Cola Named The World’s Most Polluting Brand in Plastic Waste Audit|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2019/10/29/coca-cola-named-the-worlds-most-polluting-brand-in-plastic-waste-audit/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref> The Coca-Cola Company has been faced with multiple lawsuits concerning these various criticisms.<ref>{{Cite web|last=  |first=  |date=2020-02-27|title=Group sues to hold Coca-Cola, Pepsi and others liable for plastics fouling California waters|url=https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-02-26/coca-cola-pepsi-other-big-companies-face-plastic-pollution-lawsuit|access-date=2020-11-30|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Advertising==
[[File:'96-'02 Chevrolet Express Wagon Coca-Cola.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Chevrolet Express]] van bearing the logo of The Coca-Cola Company.]]
Coca-Cola advertising has "been among the most prolific in marketing history," with a notable and major impact on popular culture and society as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

The product is ranked the number one soft drink, repeatedly, internationally, and has notoriety as the first soft drink consumed by astronauts in space. Coca-Cola employs a diverse range of integrated marketing communications to advertise through direct marketing, web-based media, social media, and sales promotions (Stringer, 2015).<ref name=":0">{{cite book|author=Stringer, G. |date=2015|title= Case Study: Coca Cola Integrated Marketing Communications|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-study-coca-cola-integrated-marketing-gregory-stringer}}
</ref>

;Direct marketing
They have exclusive vendor company partnerships, which eliminates competition, e.g. cinemas and [[restaurants]] only serving Coca-Cola over [[Pepsi]]. At sponsored sporting events, they again eliminate competition by attaining sole sale rights as well as VIP sales opportunities to important clients, for example, [[baseball field]]s. Coca-Cola has exclusive partnerships with [[McDonald's]], [[Burger King]], [[Wendy's]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] and many other fast-food chains. Coca-Cola has exclusive partnerships with [[Delta Air Lines]], [[United Airlines]], [[Southwest Airlines]]and many other airlines.

;Viral marketing
The company also markets via mobile marketing in text messages, e.g. viral marketing campaigns (Stringer, 2015).<ref name=":0" />

;Web and social media
They set the industry benchmark as the brand so universally recognized that audience building is unnecessary. Their fan engagement spans 86 million globally across social media channels. They deliver a consistently unified message whether it be through new products, online interaction, and social, cultural, or sporting events (Stringer, 2015).<ref name=":0" />

;Sales and promotions
In the retail setting, direct store beverage delivery trucks (mobile advertising) as well as point of sale coolers and vending machines have bright red logo blazoned branding. In terms of foodservice, Coca-Cola is a food pairing suggestion that is now ingrained as a food match, e.g., for popcorn, burgers, fries, and hot dog combos (Stringer, 2015).<ref name=":0" />

===Non-food assets===

====Columbia Pictures====
Coca-Cola bought [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1982, owing to the low monetary value of the studio. The film company was the first and only studio ever owned by Coca-Cola. During its ownership of the studio, Columbia released many popular films including ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', and some others. However, two years after the critical and commercial failure of the 1987 film ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'', Columbia was spun-off and then sold to [[Tokyo]]-based [[Sony]] in 1989.<ref name="sellers19971013"/>

====World of Coca-Cola====
{{Main|World of Coca-Cola}}

Coca-Cola operates a soft drink themed tourist attraction in Atlanta, Georgia; the [[World of Coca-Cola]] is a multi-storied exhibition. It features flavor sampling and a history museum, with locations in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] and [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida]].<ref name="World of Coca-Cola">{{cite web|title=Coca-Cola Store|url=http://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/explore/explore-inside/explore-coca-cola-store/|website=World of Coca-Cola|publisher=World of Coca-Cola|accessdate=January 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202044854/http://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/explore/explore-inside/explore-coca-cola-store/|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Rolling Out - World of Coca-Cola">{{cite news|last1=Caslin|first1=Yvette|title=Creative artists, social media masters inspire new World of Coca-Cola gallery|url=http://rollingout.com/2017/01/19/creative-artists-social-media-masters-inspire-new-world-of-coca-cola-gallery/|accessdate=January 26, 2017|publisher=Rolling Out|date=January 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129220703/http://rollingout.com/2017/01/19/creative-artists-social-media-masters-inspire-new-world-of-coca-cola-gallery/|archive-date=January 29, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Brands===
====Other soft drinks====
The Coca-Cola Company also produces a number of other soft drinks including [[Fanta]] (introduced circa 1941) and [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]]. Fanta's origins date back to World War II during a trade embargo against Germany on cola syrup, making it impossible to sell Coca-Cola in Germany. [[Max Keith]], the head of Coca-Cola's German office during the war, decided to create a new product for the German market, made only from products available in Germany at the time, which they named Fanta.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/fanta.asp |title = The Reich Stuff? |last = Mikkelson |first = Barbara |publisher = [[Snopes]] |date = April 29, 2011 |accessdate= May 8, 2014 }}</ref> The drink proved to be a hit, and when Coke took over again after the war, it adopted the Fanta brand as well. Fanta was originally an orange-flavored soft drink that can come in [[plastic bottle]]s or cans. It has become available in many different flavors now such as grape, peach, grapefruit, apple, pineapple, and strawberry.

In 1961, Coca-Cola introduced Sprite, a lemon-lime soft drink, and another of the company's bestsellers and its response to [[7 Up]].

[[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] was Coca-Cola's first attempt to develop a diet soft drink, using [[saccharin]] as a [[sugar substitute]]. Introduced in 1963, the product is still sold today, although its sales have dwindled since the introduction of [[Diet Coke]].<ref name="tab">{{cite news|last1=Estes|first1=Adam|title=A Brief History of Racist Soft Drinks|url=http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=The Wire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822013457/http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|archive-date=August 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Last Minute Refreshment.jpg|thumb|right|An ad in Berlin, Germany.]]
Coca-Cola South Africa also released [[Valpre]] Bottled "still" and "sparkling" water.

In 1969, the company released Simba, which was a take on Mountain Dew, and had packaging that was African desert-themed, replete with an African Lion as the symbol of the brand.  The tagline was "Simba – It Conquers the African Thirst."

Also in 1969, the company released a line of products under the name of Santiba, which was targeted for mixing cocktails and party usage, products including Quinine water and Ginger Ale.  Like the above-mentioned Simba, the Santiba line of products was short-lived in the marketplace.

====BreakMate====
{{Main|BreakMate}}

No longer manufactured, the Coca-Cola BreakMate was a three-flavor dispenser introduced by Coca-Cola and [[Siemens]] in 1988. Intended for use in offices with five to fifty people,<ref>{{cite news |title=Coca-Cola seeping into coffee breaks |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19881119&id=beZVAAAAIBAJ&pg=3496,4781541 |publisher=Eugene Register-Guard |date=November 19, 1988 |access-date=March 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403174211/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19881119&id=beZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0eEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3496,4781541 |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> its refrigerated compartment held three individual one-litre plastic containers of soda syrup and a CO<sub>2</sub> tank. Like a soda fountain, it mixed syrup in a 1:5 ratio with carbonated water. In North America, Coca-Cola discontinued spare BreakMate parts in 2007 and stopped distributing the syrup in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vendingmarketwatch.com/news/10267188/coca-cola-refreshments-discontinues-breakmate-syrup|title=Coca Cola Refreshments Discontinues BreakMate Syrup|work=VendingMarketWatch|accessdate=September 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814130040/http://www.vendingmarketwatch.com/news/10267188/coca-cola-refreshments-discontinues-breakmate-syrup|archive-date=August 14, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Healthy beverages====
During the 1990s, the company responded to the growing consumer interest in healthy beverages by introducing several new non-carbonated beverage brands. These included [[Minute Maid]] Juices to Go, [[Powerade]] sports beverage, flavored tea [[Nestea]] (in a joint venture with [[Nestlé]]), [[Fruitopia]] fruit drink, and [[Dasani]] water, among others. In 2001, the Minute Maid division launched the [[Simply Orange]] brand of juices including [[orange juice]]. In 2016, [[Coca-Cola India]] introduced [[Vio (flavoured milk)|Vio]] to enter into the value-added [[Dairy product|dairy]] category. The product lays the foundation for Coca-Cola's new segment after [[Soft drink|carbonated beverages]], water and juices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|title=Coca-Cola India Enters Dairy Market With VIO Flavored Milk|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|access-date=June 22, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.fo/20170407143024/http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|archive-date=April 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2004, perhaps in response to the burgeoning popularity of [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s such as the [[Atkins diet]], Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed [[C2 Cola]]. C2 contains a mix of [[high fructose corn syrup]], [[aspartame]], [[sucralose]], and [[Acesulfame potassium]]. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with less than half of the [[food energy]] and [[carbohydrate]]s of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.

Starting in 2009, The Coca-Cola Company invested in [[Innocent Drinks]], first with a minor stake, increasing to 90% in the first quarter of 2013.<ref name=ccc>{{Citation |last=Neate |first=Rupert |date=February 22, 2013 |title=Coca-Cola takes full control of Innocent |publisher='’[[The Guardian]]'’ |location=London (I believe) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |accessdate=June 28, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729200236/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Information====
On July 6, 2006, a Coca-Cola employee and two other people were arrested and charged with trying to sell trade secret information to the soft drink maker's competitor [[PepsiCo]] for $1.5&nbsp;million. The recipe for Coca-Cola, perhaps the company's most closely guarded secret, was never in jeopardy; instead, the information was related to a new beverage in development.
