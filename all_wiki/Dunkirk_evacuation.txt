The '''Dunkirk evacuation''', code-named '''Operation Dynamo''' and also known as the '''Miracle of Dunkirk''', was the evacuation of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers during [[World War II]] from the beaches and harbour of [[Dunkirk]], in the north of [[French Third Republic|France]], between 26 May and 4 June 1940. The operation commenced after large numbers of [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian]], [[British Army|British]], and [[French Army|French]] troops were cut off and surrounded by [[German Army (1935–1945)|German troops]] during the six-week [[Battle of France]]. In a speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called this "a colossal military disaster", saying "the whole root and core and brain of the British Army" had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured.{{sfn|Churchill|2003|p=212}} In his "[[we shall fight on the beaches]]" speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a "miracle of deliverance".{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=146}}

After [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, France and the [[British Empire]] declared war on Germany and imposed an [[Blockade of Germany (1939-45)|economic blockade]]. The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) was sent to help defend France. After the [[Phoney War]] of October 1939 to April 1940, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]], the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], and [[Battle of France|France]] on 10 May 1940. Three [[panzer corps]] attacked through the [[Ardennes]] and drove northwest to the [[English Channel]]. By 21 May, German forces had trapped the BEF, the remains of the Belgian forces, and three French [[field army|field armies]] along the northern coast of France. BEF commander [[General (British Army)|General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Viscount Gort]] immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port.

Late on 23 May, a halt order was issued by ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], commander of [[Army Group A]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] approved this order the next day, and had the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] send confirmation to the front. Attacking the trapped BEF, French, and Belgian armies was left to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' until the order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops to fight the [[Battle of Dunkirk]]. From 28 to 31 May, in the [[Siege of Lille (1940)|Siege of Lille]], the remaining 40,000 men of the French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German [[Division (military)|divisions]], including three [[Panzer division|armoured divisions]].

On the first day only 7,669 Allied soldiers were evacuated, but by the end of the eighth day, 338,226 had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 vessels. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective [[mole (architecture)|mole]] onto 39 British [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]]s, four [[Royal Canadian Navy]] destroyers,{{sfn|McIntyre|2017}} at least three [[French Navy]] destroyers, and a variety of civilian merchant ships. Others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what became known as the [[Little Ships of Dunkirk]], a [[flotilla]] of hundreds of [[merchant marine]] boats, [[fishing boat]]s, [[pleasure craft]], [[yacht]]s, and [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment. In his 4 June speech, Churchill also reminded the country that "we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations."{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}}

==Background==
{{Further|Battle of France}}
In September 1939, after [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], the United Kingdom sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to aid in the defence of France, landing at [[Cherbourg]], [[Nantes]], and [[Saint-Nazaire]]. By May 1940 the force consisted of ten [[Division (military)|divisions]] in three [[corps]] under the command of General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]].{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=9}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=7}} Working with the BEF were the [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian Army]] and the French [[First Army (France)|First]], [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh]], and [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth]] Armies.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=305}}

During the 1930s, the French had constructed the [[Maginot Line]], a series of fortifications along their border with Germany. This line had been designed to deter a German invasion across the Franco-German border and funnel an attack into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the [[French Army]]. Thus, any future war would take place outside of French territory, [[Zone rouge|avoiding a repeat]] of the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Roth|2010|p=6}} The area immediately to the north of the Maginot Line was covered by the heavily wooded [[Ardennes]] region,{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2007|p=23}} which French General [[Philippe Pétain]] declared to be "impenetrable" as long as "special provisions" were taken. He believed that any enemy force emerging from the forest would be vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] and destroyed. The French commander-in-chief, [[Maurice Gamelin]], also believed the area to be of a limited threat, noting that it "never favoured large operations".{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=32}} With this in mind, the area was left lightly defended.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}

The initial plan for the German [[battle of France|invasion of France]] called for an encirclement attack through the Netherlands and Belgium, avoiding the Maginot Line.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=140}} [[Erich von Manstein]], then Chief of Staff of the German [[Army Group A]], prepared the outline of a different plan and submitted it to the [[OKH]] (German High Command) via his superior, ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]].{{sfn|Lemay|2010|pp=98–102}}{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11–14}} Manstein's plan suggested that panzer divisions should attack through the Ardennes, then establish [[bridgehead]]s on the [[Meuse River]] and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Germans would thus cut off the [[Allies of World War II|Allied armies]] in Belgium. This part of the plan later became known as the ''Sichelschnitt'' ("sickle cut").{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11–14}}{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=145}} [[Adolf Hitler]] approved a modified version of Manstein's ideas, today known as the [[Manstein Plan]], after meeting with him on 17 February.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=132}}

[[File:16May-21May Battle of Belgium.PNG|thumb|Situation on 21 May 1940; German forces occupy the area shaded in pink]]

On 10 May, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]] and [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=713}} [[Army Group B]], under ''Generaloberst'' [[Fedor von Bock]], attacked into Belgium, while the three panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung around to the south and drove for the Channel.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=37}} The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the [[River Dyle]] within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Churchill|1949|loc=Map, p. 33}} They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the [[Scheldt River]] on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=74–75}} During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was astonished to learn from Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=47}} On 19 May, Gort met with French General [[Gaston Billotte]], commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea. Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|pp=64–65}} Surrounded by marshes, Dunkirk boasted old fortifications and the longest sand beach in Europe, where large groups could assemble.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}} On 20 May, on Churchill's suggestion, the Admiralty began arranging for all available small vessels to be made ready to proceed to France.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=58–59}} After continued engagements and a failed Allied attempt on 21 May at [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Arras]] to cut through the German spearhead,{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=98}} the BEF was trapped, along with the remains of the Belgian forces and the three French armies, in an area along the coast of northern France and Belgium.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=728}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|loc=Map, p. 61}}

==Prelude==
[[File:Gort and Blount at Arras WWII IWM O 177.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Gort]] (gesturing, at centre) was commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]. ]]
Without informing the French, the British began planning on 20 May for Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the BEF.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}}{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=58–59}} This planning was headed by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Bertram Ramsay]] at the naval headquarters below [[Dover Castle]], from which he briefed Churchill as it was under way.{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=43–44}} Ships began gathering at Dover for the evacuation.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=100}} On 20 May, the BEF sent Brigadier Gerald Whitfield to Dunkirk to start evacuating unnecessary personnel. Overwhelmed by what he later described as "a somewhat alarming movement towards Dunkirk by both officers and men", due to a shortage of food and water, he had to send many along without thoroughly checking their credentials. Even officers ordered to stay behind to aid the evacuation disappeared onto the boats.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=124}}

On 22 May, Churchill ordered the BEF to attack southward in coordination with the French First Army under General [[Georges Maurice Jean Blanchard|Georges Blanchard]] to reconnect with the remainder of the French forces.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=65}} This proposed action was dubbed the Weygand Plan after General [[Maxime Weygand]], appointed Supreme Commander after Gamelin's dismissal on 18 May.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=57}} On 25 May, Gort had to abandon any hope of achieving this objective and withdrew on his own initiative, along with Blanchard's forces, behind the Lys Canal, part of a canal system that reached the sea at [[Gravelines]].{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=84}} Sluice gates had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal Line) against the German advance.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=78–79}}

===Battle of Dunkirk===
{{Main|Battle of Dunkirk}}
[[File:Dunkirksoldier1.JPG|left|thumb|Soldiers were [[strafe]]d and bombed by German aircraft while awaiting transport.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}]]
By 24 May, the Germans had captured the port of [[Boulogne]] and surrounded [[Calais]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=728}} The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under ''[[Generalmajor]]'' [[Rudolf Veiel]] built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to Dunkirk.{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=152}} On 23 May, at the suggestion of [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth Army]] commander ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Günther von Kluge]], Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks and the question of supply to his forward troops.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|p=167}}{{sfn|Army Group A War Diary}}{{sfn|OKW Jodl Diary}}{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=28–35}} He was also concerned that the marshy ground around Dunkirk would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30–50 per cent).{{sfn|Cooper|1978| pp=230–31}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=120}} Hitler was also apprehensive, and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.{{sfn|Cooper|1978| pp=230–31}}{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=28–35}}

Air Marshal [[Hermann Göring]] urged Hitler to let the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (aided by Army Group B{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=150}}) finish off the British, to the consternation of General [[Franz Halder]], who noted in his diary that the ''Luftwaffe'' was dependent upon the weather and aircrews were worn out after two weeks of battle.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|pp=167–68}} Rundstedt issued another order, which was sent uncoded. It was picked up by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Y service]] intelligence network at 12:42: "By order of the Fuhrer&nbsp;... attack north-west of Arras is to be limited to the general line Lens–Bethune–Aire–St Omer–Gravelines. The Canal will not be crossed."{{sfn|Costello|1991|p=175}}{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p=31}} Later that day, Hitler issued Directive 13, which called for the ''Luftwaffe'' to defeat the trapped Allied forces and stop their escape.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|p=232}} At 15:30 on 26 May, Hitler ordered the panzer groups to continue their advance, but most units took another 16 hours to attack.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|p=235}} The delay gave the Allies time to prepare defences vital for the evacuation and prevented the Germans from stopping the Allied retreat from Lille.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|p=168}}

The halt order has been the subject of much discussion by historians.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=76}}{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=149}} Guderian considered the failure to order a timely assault on Dunkirk to be one of the major German mistakes on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].{{sfn|Guderian|2001|loc=Footnote, p. 117}} Rundstedt called it "one of the great turning points of the war",{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=731}} and Manstein described it as "one of Hitler's most critical mistakes".{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=153}} [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] interviewed many of the generals after the war and put together a picture of Hitler's strategic thinking on the matter. Hitler believed that once Britain's troops left continental Europe, they would never return.{{sfn|Hart|1948}}{{page needed|date=July 2015}}

==Evacuation==
===26–27 May===
[[File:Dunkirk 26-29 May 1940 NYP68075.jpg|thumb|British troops were lined up on the beach while awaiting evacuation, 26–29 May 1940]]
[[File:Wounded British soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk make their way up the gangplank from a destroyer at Dover, 31 May 1940. H1623.jpg|thumb|Troops evacuated from Dunkirk arrive at Dover, 31 May 1940]]
The retreat was undertaken amid chaotic conditions, with abandoned vehicles blocking the roads and a flood of refugees heading in the opposite direction.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=145}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|pp=59, 75}} Due to wartime censorship and the desire to keep up British morale, the full extent of the unfolding disaster at Dunkirk was not initially publicised. A special service attended by [[King George VI]] was held in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 26 May, which was declared a national day of prayer.{{sfn|Miller|1997|p=83}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=122}} The [[Cosmo Gordon Lang|Archbishop of Canterbury]] led prayers "for our soldiers in dire peril in France". Similar prayers were offered in synagogues and churches throughout the UK that day, confirming to the public their suspicion of the desperate plight of the troops.{{sfn|Gelb|1990|p=82}} Just before 19:00 on 26 May, Churchill ordered Dynamo to begin, by which time 28,000 men had already departed.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}} Initial plans called for the recovery of 45,000 men from the BEF within two days, at which time German troops were expected to block further evacuation. Only 25,000 men escaped during this period, including 7,669 on the first day.{{sfn|Liddell Hart|1999|p=78}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}

On 27 May, the first full day of the evacuation, one [[cruiser]], eight [[destroyer]]s, and 26 other craft were active.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=106}} Admiralty officers combed nearby boatyards for small craft that could ferry personnel from the beaches out to larger craft in the harbour, as well as larger vessels that could load from the docks. An emergency call was put out for additional help, and by 31 May nearly four hundred small craft were voluntarily and enthusiastically taking part in the effort.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=100–01}}

The same day, the ''Luftwaffe'' heavily bombed Dunkirk, both the town and the dock installations. As the water supply was knocked out, the resulting fires could not be extinguished.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=149}} An estimated thousand civilians were killed, one-third of the remaining population of the town.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=150}} RAF squadrons were ordered to provide [[air supremacy]] for the Royal Navy during evacuation. Their efforts shifted to covering Dunkirk and the English Channel, protecting the evacuation fleet.{{sfn|Thompson|1953|p=62}} The ''Luftwaffe'' was met by 16 squadrons of the RAF, who claimed 38 kills on 27 May while losing 14 aircraft.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=149}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=228}} Many more RAF fighters sustained damage and were subsequently written off. On the German side, ''[[Kampfgeschwader 2]]'' (KG 2) and [[KG 3]] suffered the heaviest casualties. German losses amounted to 23 [[Dornier Do 17]]s. [[KG 1]] and [[KG 4]] bombed the beach and harbour and [[KG 54]] sank the 8,000-ton steamer ''Aden''. [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive bombers sank the troopship ''Cote d' Azur''. The ''Luftwaffe'' engaged with 300 bombers which were protected by 550 fighter sorties and attacked Dunkirk in twelve raids. They dropped 15,000 [[high explosive]] and 30,000 [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]], destroying the oil tanks and wrecking the harbour.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|pp=116–117}} [[No. 11 Group RAF]] flew 22 patrols with 287 aircraft this day, in formations of up to 20 aircraft.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=117}}

Altogether, over 3,500 sorties were flown in support of Operation Dynamo.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=228}} The RAF continued to inflict a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and [[strafe]]d while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing nothing to help.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}

On 25 and 26 May, the ''Luftwaffe'' focused their attention on Allied pockets holding out at Calais, [[Lille]], and [[Amiens]], and did not attack Dunkirk.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=150}} Calais, held by the BEF, surrendered on 26 May.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=119}} Remnants of the French First Army, [[Siege of Lille (1940)|surrounded at Lille]], fought off seven German divisions, several of them armoured, until 31 May, when the remaining 35,000 soldiers were forced to surrender after running out of food and ammunition.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=97}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=144}} The Germans accorded the [[honours of war]] to the defenders of Lille in recognition of their bravery.{{sfn|Fermer|2013|p=208}}

===28 May – 4 June===
[[File:21May-4June1940-Fall Gelb.jpg|thumb|Situation on 4 June 1940; the remaining French rearguard held a sliver of land around Dunkirk]]
[[File:East Mole Dunkirk.jpg|thumb|East mole (2009)]]
The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=729}} leaving a large gap to the east of Dunkirk. Several British divisions were rushed in to cover that side.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=96}} The ''Luftwaffe'' flew fewer sorties over Dunkirk on 28 May, switching their attention to the Belgian ports of [[Ostend]] and [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]]. The weather over Dunkirk was not conducive to dive or low-level bombing. The RAF flew 11 patrols and 321 sorties, claiming 23 destroyed for the loss of 13 aircraft.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=117}} On 28 May, 17,804 soldiers arrived at British ports.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}

On 29 May, 47,310 British troops were rescued{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}} as the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s Ju 87s exacted a heavy toll on shipping. The British destroyer [[HMS Grenade (H86)|HMS ''Grenade'']] was sunk and the [[French destroyer Mistral|French destroyer ''Mistral'']] was crippled, while her sister ships, each laden with 500 men, were damaged by near misses. British destroyers [[HMS Jaguar (F34)|''Jaguar'']] and [[HMS Verity (D63)|''Verity'']] were badly damaged but escaped the harbour. Two trawlers disintegrated in the attack. Later, the passenger steamer {{SS|Fenella|1936|6}} sank with 600 men aboard at the pier but the men were able to get off. The paddle steamer {{HMS|Crested Eagle}} suffered a direct hit, caught fire, and sank with severe casualties. The raiders also destroyed the two rail-owned ships, the {{SS|Lorina|1918|6}} and the {{SS|Normannia|1911|6}}.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=138}} Of the five major German attacks, just two were contested by RAF fighters; the British lost 16 fighters in nine patrols. German losses amounted to 11 Ju 87s destroyed or damaged.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=118}}

On 30 May, Churchill received word that all British divisions were now behind the defensive lines, along with more than half of the French First Army.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=97}} By this time, the perimeter ran along a series of canals about {{convert|7|mi}} from the coast, in marshy country not suitable for tanks.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=226}} With the docks in the harbour rendered unusable by German air attacks, senior naval officer Captain (later Admiral) [[William Tennant (Royal Navy officer)|William Tennant]] initially ordered men to be evacuated from the beaches. When this proved too slow, he re-routed the evacuees to two long stone and concrete breakwaters, called the east and west moles, as well as the beaches. The moles were not designed to dock ships, but despite this, the majority of troops rescued from Dunkirk were taken off this way.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|pp=84, 94}} Almost 200,000 troops embarked on ships from the east mole (which stretched nearly a mile out to sea) over the next week.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=150–51}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|pp=88, 97}} [[James Campbell Clouston]], pier master on the east mole, organised and regulated the flow of men along the mole into the waiting ships.{{sfn|Lord|1983|p=243}} Once more, low clouds kept ''Luftwaffe'' activity to a minimum. Nine RAF patrols were mounted, with no German formation encountered.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=119}} The following day, the ''Luftwaffe'' sank one transport and damaged 12 others for 17 losses; the British claimed 38 kills, which was an exaggeration. The RAF and [[Fleet Air Arm]] lost 28 aircraft.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=119}}

Of the total 338,226 soldiers, several hundred were unarmed Indian [[arriero|mule handlers]] on detachment from the [[Royal Indian Army Service Corps]], forming four of the six units of Force K-6 transport. Cypriot muleteers were also present. Three units were successfully evacuated and one captured.{{sfn|Dunkirk 1940.org}}{{sfn|Bajwa|2013}}{{sfn|Gojkovic|2017}} Also present at Dunkirk were a small number of French Senegalese soldiers and Moroccans.{{sfn|Shephard|2003|p=169}}{{sfn|Richardson|2010|p=32}}

The next day, an additional 53,823 men were embarked,{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}} including the first French soldiers.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2000|p=80}} Lord Gort and 68,014 men were evacuated on 31 May,{{sfn|Keegan|1989|p=81}} leaving Major-General [[Harold Alexander]] in command of the rearguard.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=109}} A further 64,429 Allied soldiers departed on 1 June,{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}} before the increasing air attacks prevented further daylight evacuation.{{sfn|Liddell Hart|1999|p=79}} The British rearguard of 4,000 men left on the night of 2–3 June.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=737}} An additional 75,000 French troops were retrieved over the nights of 2–4 June,{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}{{sfn|Liddell Hart|1999|p=80}} before the operation finally ended. The remainder of the rearguard, 40,000 French troops, surrendered on 4 June.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=737}} Churchill made a point of stating in his "[[We shall fight on the beaches]]" address in the House on 4 June that the evacuation had been made possible through the efforts of the RAF.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}

[[File:The Evacuation From Dunkirk, May - June 1940 H1647.jpg|thumb|Evacuated troops arrive in Dover]]
Three routes were allocated to the evacuating vessels. The shortest was Route Z, a distance of {{convert|39|nmi|km}}, but it entailed hugging the French coast and thus ships using it were subject to bombardment from on-shore batteries, particularly in daylight hours.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|loc=Map, p. 223}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=166}} Route X, although the safest from shore batteries, travelled through a particularly heavily mined portion of the Channel. Ships on this route travelled {{convert|55|nmi|km}} north out of Dunkirk, proceeded through the Ruytingen Pass,{{sfn|Gardner|1949|p=20}} and headed towards the North Goodwin Lightship before heading south around the [[Goodwin Sands]] to Dover.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|loc=Map, p. 223}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=166}} The route was safest from surface attacks, but the nearby minefields and sandbanks meant it could not be used at night.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=224}} The longest of the three was Route Y, a distance of {{convert|87|nmi|km}}; using this route increased the sailing time to four hours, double the time required for Route Z. This route followed the French coast as far as [[Bray-Dunes]], then turned north-east until reaching the Kwinte Buoy.{{sfn|Dildy|2010|p=50}} Here, after making an approximately 135-degree turn, the ships sailed west to the North Goodwin Lightship and headed south around the Goodwin Sands to Dover.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|loc=Map, p. 223}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=166}} Ships on Route Y were the most likely to be attacked by German surface vessels, submarines, and the ''Luftwaffe''.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=222}}

{{Quote|You knew this was the chance to get home and you kept praying, please God, let us go, get us out, get us out of this mess back to England. To see that ship that came in to pick me and my brother up, it was a most fantastic sight. We saw dog fights up in the air, hoping nothing would happen to us and we saw one or two terrible sights. Then somebody said, there's Dover, that was when we saw the [[White Cliffs of Dover|White Cliffs]], the atmosphere was terrific. From hell to heaven was how the feeling was, you felt like a miracle had happened.|Harry Garrett, British Army, speaking to [[KM Group|Kent Online]]{{sfn|Chessum|2014}} }}

The [[Royal Navy]] provided the anti-aircraft cruiser [[HMS Calcutta (D82)|HMS ''Calcutta'']], 39 destroyers, and many other craft. The [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] supplied passenger ferries, hospital ships, and other vessels. Britain's Belgian, Dutch, Canadian,{{sfn|McIntyre|2017}} Polish,{{sfn|ORP ''Błyskawica'' Society}} and French allies provided vessels as well. Admiral Ramsay arranged for around a thousand copies to be made of the required charts, had buoys laid around the Goodwin Sands and down to Dunkirk, and organised the flow of shipping.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=224}} Larger ships such as destroyers were able to carry about 900 men per trip. The soldiers mostly travelled on the upper decks for fear of being trapped below if the ship sank.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=229}} After the loss on 29 May of 19 British and [[French navy]] ships plus three of the larger requisitioned vessels, the Admiralty withdrew their eight best destroyers for the future defence of the country.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=174}}

===Little ships===
{{Main|Little Ships of Dunkirk}}
{{See also|Royal National Lifeboat Institution}}

A wide variety of small vessels from all over the south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They included speedboats, [[Thames]] vessels, car ferries, [[pleasure craft]], and many other types of small craft.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=234}} The most useful proved to be the motor [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]], which had a reasonably good capacity and speed.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=234}} Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the [[Minister of Shipping|Ministry of Shipping]], accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to [[Sheerness]], where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=198}}

The first of the "little ships" arrived at Dunkirk on 28 May.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=229}} The wide sand beaches meant that large vessels could not get anywhere near the shore, and even small craft had to stop about {{convert|100|yd|m}} from the waterline and wait for the soldiers to wade out.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=225}} In many cases, personnel would abandon their boat upon reaching a larger ship, and subsequent evacuees had to wait for boats to drift ashore with the tide before they could make use of them.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=199}} In most areas on the beaches, soldiers queued up with their units and patiently awaited their turn to leave. But at times, panicky soldiers had to be warned off at gunpoint when they attempted to rush to the boats out of turn.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=167–68}} In addition to ferrying out on boats, soldiers at [[De Panne]] and Bray-Dunes constructed improvised jetties by driving rows of abandoned vehicles onto the beach at low tide, anchoring them with sandbags, and connecting them with wooden walkways.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=214–15}}

Before the operation was completed, the prognosis had been gloomy, with Churchill warning the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 28 May to expect "hard and heavy tidings".{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=99}} Subsequently, Churchill referred to the outcome as a miracle, and the British press presented the evacuation as a "disaster turned to triumph" so successfully that Churchill had to remind the country in a speech to the House of Commons on 4 June that "we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations."{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}} [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] comments that the confusion over the Dunkirk evacuation is illustrated by two of the best books on it being called ''Strange Defeat'' and ''Strange Victory''.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=37}}

Three British divisions and a host of logistic and labour troops were cut off to the south of the Somme by the German "race to the sea". At the end of May, a further two divisions began moving to France with the hope of establishing a [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)#The Second BEF and Operation Ariel|Second BEF]]. The majority of the [[51st (Highland) Division]] was forced to surrender on 12 June, but almost 192,000 Allied personnel, 144,000 of them British, were evacuated through various French ports from 15 to 25 June under the codename [[Operation Ariel]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=296–305}} Remaining British forces under the Tenth Army as ''[[Norman Force]]'' retreated towards [[Cherbourg]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=300–302}} The Germans marched into [[Paris]] on 14 June and France surrendered eight days later.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=232–34}}

The more than 100,000 French troops evacuated from Dunkirk were quickly and efficiently shuttled to camps in various parts of south-western England, where they were temporarily lodged before being repatriated.{{sfn|Looseley|2005|p=}} British ships ferried French troops to [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], and other ports in [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]], although only about half of the repatriated troops were redeployed against the Germans before the surrender of France. For many French soldiers, the Dunkirk evacuation represented only a few weeks' delay before being killed or captured by the German army after their return to France.{{sfn|Mordal|1968|p=496}} Of the French soldiers evacuated from France in June 1940, about 3,000 joined [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free French]] army in Britain.{{sfn|Nadeau|Barlow|2003|p=89}}

In France, the unilateral British decision to evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, and the perceived preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces at the expense of the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral [[François Darlan]] originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=111}} In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of [[2nd Light Mechanized Division (France)|2nd Light Mechanized Division]] and the [[68th Infantry Division (France)|68th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=219}}{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=115}} Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}

The evacuation was presented to the German public as an overwhelming and decisive German victory. On 5 June 1940, Hitler stated "Dunkirk has fallen! 40,000 French and English troops are all that remains of the formerly great armies. Immeasurable quantities of materiel have been captured. The greatest battle in the history of the world has come to an end."{{efn|Original German: "Dünkirchen ist gefallen! 40 000 Franzosen und Engländer sind als letzter Rest einstiger großer Armeen gefangen. Unübersehbares Material wurde erbeutet. Damit ist die größte Schlacht der Weltgeschichte beendet."}}{{sfn|Hitler|1940|nopp=y}} ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (OKW, the German armed forces high command) announced the event as "the greatest annihilation battle of all time".{{sfn|OKW|1940|nopp=y}}

The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers (dead, wounded, missing, or captured) from 10 May until the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|armistice with France]] on 22 June.{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=151}} 3,500 British were killed{{sfn|French|2002|p=156}} and 13,053 wounded.{{sfn|Blaxland|1973|p=346}} All the heavy equipment had to be abandoned.{{sfn|Longden|2009|p=11}} Left behind in France were 2,472 guns, 20,000 motorcycles, and almost 65,000 other vehicles; also abandoned were {{convert|416000|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} of stores, more than {{convert|75000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of ammunition and {{convert|162000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of fuel.{{sfn|Longden|2009|p=11}} Almost all of the 445 British tanks that had been sent to France with the BEF were abandoned.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=300}}

Six British and three French destroyers were sunk, along with nine other major vessels. In addition, 19 destroyers were damaged.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2000|p=81}} Over 200 British and Allied sea craft were sunk, with a similar number damaged.{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=267}} The Royal Navy's most significant losses in the operation were six destroyers:
* {{HMS|Grafton|H89|2}}, sunk by {{Ship|German submarine|U-62|1939|2}} on 29 May{{sfn|English|1993|p=98}}
* {{HMS|Grenade|H86|2}}, sunk by air attack at Dunkirk on 29 May{{sfn|English|1993|p=99}}
* {{HMS|Wakeful|H88|2}}, sunk by a [[torpedo]] from the [[E-boat]] ''S-30'' on 29 May{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=170–71}}
* {{HMS|Basilisk|H11|2}}, {{HMS|Havant|H32|2}}, and {{HMS|Keith|D06|2}}, sunk by air attack off the beaches on 1 June{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=204–05}}

The [[French Navy]] lost three destroyers:
* {{Ship|French destroyer|Bourrasque||2}}, mined off [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuport]] on 30 May
* {{Ship|French destroyer|Siroco||2}}, sunk by the [[E-boat]]s ''S-23'' and ''S-26'' on 31 May
* [[French destroyer Foudroyant (1929)|''Le Foudroyant'']], sunk by air attack off the beaches on 1 June

The RAF lost 145 aircraft, of which at least 42 were [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]], while the ''Luftwaffe'' lost 156 aircraft in operations in the nine days of Operation Dynamo,{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=206}} including 35 destroyed by Royal Navy ships (plus 21 damaged) during the six days from 27 May to 1 June.{{sfn|Ramsey|1947|loc=Appendix III}}

For every seven soldiers who escaped through Dunkirk, one man was left behind as a [[prisoner of war]]. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany. Prisoners reported brutal treatment by their guards, including beatings, starvation, and murder. Another complaint was that German guards kicked over buckets of water that had been left at the roadside by French civilians for the marching prisoners to drink.{{sfn|Longden|2009|p=361}}

Many of the prisoners were marched to the city of [[Trier]], with the march taking as long as 20 days. Others were marched to the river [[Scheldt]] and were sent by barge to the [[Ruhr]]. The prisoners were then sent by rail to prisoner of war camps in Germany.{{sfn|Longden|2009|pp=383–404}} The majority (those below the rank of corporal) then worked in German industry and agriculture for the remainder of the war.{{sfn|Longden|2005|p=260}}

Those of the BEF who died or were captured and have no known grave are commemorated on the [[Dunkirk Memorial]].{{sfn|Dunkirk Memorial}}
