== History ==
[[File:Joseph wharton.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Wharton]], the school's founder and namesake]]

Joseph Wharton, a native Philadelphian, was a leader in industrial metallurgy who built his fortune through the American Nickel Company and [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]]. As Wharton's business grew, he recognized that business knowledge in the United States was only taught through an apprenticeship system, and such a system was not viable for creating a wider economy during the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].<ref name="thebhc.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.thebhc.org/publications/BEHprint/v012/p0029-p0036.pdf |title=History in Schools of Business |author1=Daniel A.

Wharton was quoted as saying that the school was meant to "instill a sense of the coming strife [in business life]: of the immense swings upward or downward that await the competent or the incompetent soldier in this modern strife".<ref name="thebhc.org" />

From the founding of the school, he defined that its goal was "to provide for young men special means of training and of correct instruction in the knowledge and in the arts of modern Finance and Economy, both public and private, in order that, being well informed and free from delusions upon these important subjects, they may either serve the community skillfully as well as faithfully in offices of trust, or, remaining in private life, may prudently manage their own affairs and aid in maintaining sound financial morality: in short, to establish means for imparting a liberal education in all matters concerning Finance and Economy".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATDuA-p2vSUC&q=%22wharton+school+of+finance+and+economy%22&pg=PA206 |title=Joseph Wharton: Quaker industrial ... – Google Books |accessdate=August 9, 2010|isbn=9780934223003 |last1=Yates |first1=Willard Ross |year=1987 }}</ref> The school was renamed the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce, in 1902,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/about/wharton-history.cfm |title=About Wharton—Wharton History |accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref> and formally changed its name to simply Wharton School in 1972.<ref>{{cite news |title=U. of Pennsylvania Shortens Name of Wharton School |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/16/archives/u-of-pennsylvania-shortens-name-of-wharton-school.html |date=May 16, 1972 |access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref>

Early on, the Wharton School faculty was tightly connected to an influential group of businessmen, bankers and lawyers that made up the larger Philadelphia School of Political Economy.<ref name="wharton.upenn.edu">{{cite web |url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/huntsmanhall/timeline/1881.html |title=Wharton: A Century of Leadership |publisher=Wharton.upenn.edu |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref> The faculty incorporated social sciences into the Wharton curriculum, as the field of business was still under development. Albert S. Bolles, a lawyer, served as Wharton's first professor,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/faids/upb/upb5/upb5_9ir.html |title=Wharton: Archival Collections |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |date=October 4, 2014}}</ref> and the school's Industrial Research Unit was established in 1921.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/innovationHistory/leaders.html |title=Wharton: A Century of Innovation |publisher=Wharton School |accessdate=January 3, 2014}}</ref>

Wharton professor [[Simon Kuznets]], who later won the Nobel Prize in Economics, created statistical data on national output, prices, investment, and capital stock, and also measured seasonability, cycles, and secular trends of these phenomena. His work laid out what became the standard procedure for measuring the [[gross national product]] and the [[gross domestic product]], and he later led an international effort to establish the same statistical information for all national economies.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/innovationHistory/boom.html |title=Wharton: From Boom to Bust to Boom |publisher=Wharton School |accessdate=January 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name="kuznets">{{cite web |quotation=Congress commissioned Kuznets to create a system that would measure the nation's productivity in order to better understand how to tackle the Great Depression |author=Simon Kuznets |year=1934 |title="National Income, 1929–1932". 73rd US Congress, 2d session, Senate document no. 124, page 5-7 Simon Kuznets, 1934.

Wharton professor [[Solomon S. Huebner]] is known widely as "the father of insurance education." He originated the concept of "human life value", which became a standard method of calculating insurance value and need.

The Wharton School's first business professor was an attorney, Albert Bolles. At the time, there were no other business schools and no business professors could be recruited elsewhere. Bolles, a lawyer by education and training, and business journalist by career, seemed to be the best option for Joseph Wharton.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Bolles started his career as a lawyer in Connecticut in the second half of the 19th century. After resigning from his law firm, he started pursuing a new career in business journalism and was promoted to the editor role of ''Bankers Magazine'', a trade publication, in 1880. Upon joining the Wharton School, he began teaching business with classes on the law of governing finance and on the processes of commercial banking. Bolles' instruction in finance was influenced by his previous experience in ''Bankers Magazine'': he stressed conservative business practices, drawing on business history as much as he could. In his classes, inflationist Congressmen were "self-interested debtors". Besides teaching, Bolles advocated for several national reforms, including the uniform banking law. Wharton historian Steven A. Sass wrote about him, "Bolles thus fulfilled Joseph Wharton's pedagogic expectations and…got the new school off to a respectable start by the spring of 1883".<ref name="thebhc.org" /> In 1884, the first five business students were awarded a Bachelor of Finance degree. One graduate, Shiro Shiba, returned to Japan where he would become a member of the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]], the Japanese parliament, and another, [[Robert Adams, Jr.]], later was named [[U.S. Ambassador to Brazil]].<ref name="wharton.upenn.edu" />

Classes in business and finance abounded at the Wharton School, but it was lacking in any other areas of business interest. [[Edmund J. James]], with a doctorate from the [[University of Halle]] in Germany, reinvigorated the school's curriculum, starting classes on political finance and administration. Later in 1885, James argued for redesigning the course of study at Wharton with elements of German higher education. He wanted to include training in banking, railroading, merchandising, manufacturing and other similar branches, and expand the course's length to four years from the initial three. Joseph Wharton in November 1893 pledged an additional $75,000 to the school in order to implement James' ideas in the school's curriculum. A more comprehensive study plan was then rolled out.<ref name="thebhc.org" /> Between 1895 and 1915, James started teaching at Wharton the new fields of finance and management as they were developing in the business world. The Wharton School improved its reputation from a bunch of academic "misfits", and some of its alumni rose in the U.S. business world.<ref name="archives.upenn.edu">{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/schools/wharton.html |title=History: School of the Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania University Archives |publisher=Archives.upenn.edu |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref> During this period, the school continued to attract additional faculty members and expand its research programs.<ref name="About Wharton: Past Leaders">{{cite web |url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/about/past-leaders.cfm |title=About Wharton: Past Leaders |publisher=Wharton School |accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref>

Wharton began awarding MBA degrees in 1921.<ref name="archives.upenn.edu" /> In 1942, during [[World War II]], in the same fashion of other schools, Wharton's full-time faculty dropped dramatically from 165 to 39 by 1944. According to school historians, members of the faculty were called upon for special posts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/huntsmanhall/timeline/1940.html |title=Wharton: A Century of Leadership |publisher=Wharton.upenn.edu |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref> In 1959, Wharton adopted the curriculum that is now taught in most major business schools: the program was changed with liberal arts education doubling to almost half of the curriculum, and the social sciences department was moved to the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences]] in 1975. Since then, Wharton faculty have focused exclusively on business education.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Wharton undergraduate students in cohorts.jpg|thumb|right|Wharton undergraduate students with cohort banners]]
Prospective Wharton candidates apply in their senior year of high school either through the [[early decision]] (ED) process or regular decision (RD) process. Unlike many other undergraduate business programs where students transfer in after their freshman or second year (University of Virginia's McIntire, Emory's Goizueta, UC Berkeley's Haas), Wharton applicants apply specifically for Wharton during their senior year of high school. These candidates are then grouped with a pool of applicants separate from those applying to University of Pennsylvania's College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), or School of Nursing. Each of the other three schools forms its own separate pool of applicants too.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/undergrad/ |title=Wharton Undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania |website=Wharton.upenn.edu |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}</ref>

The [[legacy preferences|legacy status]] of applicants, defined as having a parent or another direct relative who attended the same academic institution, may be taken into consideration in the admissions process. This correlation has been observed in a number of empirical studies conducted on the nation's most elite schools,<ref>[http://chronicle.com/article/Legacys-Advantage-May-Be/125812/ At Elite Colleges, Legacy Status May Count More Than Was Previously Thought];  ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', January 5, 2011</ref> with a particular focus on [[Ivy League]] universities.<ref>[https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204653604577249230164868846 Should Colleges Consider Legacies in the Admissions Process];  ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', July 9, 2012</ref> Leading universities in the United States cite stronger alumni connections and continued support as the primary reasons for this practice.

=== Graduation and employment ===
Wharton undergraduate students are required to graduate with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[Economics]] with at least 1 of 21 current concentrations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://undergrad.wharton.upenn.edu/concentrations/|title=Concentrations|website=Undergraduate|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> Concentrations range from [[finance]] and [[accounting]] to unique studies such as business analytics and Social Impact & Responsibility. Obtaining a concentration requires a student to take 4 classes outside of what is required in the core curriculum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/curriculum/|title=Curriculum|website=Undergrad Inside|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> Policy has recently changed such that Wharton students can graduate with a maximum of 2 concentrations rather than 3. [[File:Quadrangle Building at the University of Pennsylvania.jpg|300 px|thumb|right|Quadrangle at the University of Pennsylvania]]
In the 2015–16 school year, 334 employers participated in the on-campus recruiting process; each student received an average of 7.6 first-round interviews and 1.8 job offers.<ref name="WUG2016">{{cite web|url=http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/files/WHA_2016cp.pdf|title=Wharton Undergraduate Class of 2016: Career Plans Survey Report|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Career Services'|access-date=March 14, 2017}}</ref> About 48% of Wharton's typical undergraduate class of 650 students go into [[financial services]], with the top sectors being [[investment banking]], [[investment management]], and [[private equity]].<ref name=WUG2016 /> The next most common industry after finance is [[management consulting]], which hires approximately 22% of the students, while a significant number of students enter marketing, sales, and the technology industry, particularly in [[Silicon Valley]].<ref name=WUG2016 />

=== Doctoral program ===

== Executive Education ==
The Wharton School also operates the Aresty Institute of Executive Education (commonly known as "Wharton Executive Education"), a center for continuing business education for senior executives. The institute is named in honor of civic leader, business owner, philanthropist, and Wharton alumnus Julian Aresty and his brother Joseph Aresty, who together endowed the Aresty Institute for Executive Education in 1987.<ref>{{cite web |title=Campus News Briefs |url=http://www.thedp.com/article/1999/09/campus_news_briefs_wednesday_september_29_1999 |work=[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]] |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref>

Wharton Executive Education offers programs for executives in areas such as finance, marketing, strategy, and innovation. Each year, more than 10,000 professionals from around the world attend Wharton Executive Education programs in classes taught by full-time Wharton faculty.

Wharton offers more than 50 open-enrollment programs for individuals on campuses in Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Beijing, China. Wharton also overs three long duration open-enrollment programs that confer alumni status upon successful completion.

The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] meant a rapid shift towards online teaching, transforming some of the classroom courses into online courses. For years there has been a strong investment in online education, so the school has been able to adapt well to the new circumstances, according to the ''[[Financial Times]]'' analysis on the adaptation of business schools to COVID-19.<ref>{{Cite web|title=FT Executive Education Rankings 2020: analysis amid the pandemic|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1c3f4b42-8172-11ea-b6e9-a94cffd1d9bf|last=Moules|first=Jonathan|date=2020-05-10|website=www.ft.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref>
