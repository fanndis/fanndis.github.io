"'''One country, two systems'''" is a [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitutional principle of the People's Republic of China]] describing the governance of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] since they became [[Special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions (SARs)]] of [[China]] in 1997 and 1999 respectively.

It was formulated in the early 1980s by [[Paramount leader|Chinese leader]] [[Deng Xiaoping]] during negotiations with the United Kingdom over Hong Kong. He suggested that there would be only [[One-China policy|one China]], but that these regions could retain their own economic and administrative systems, while the rest of [[Mainland China]] uses the [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]] system. Under the principle, each of the two regions could continue to have its own governmental system, legal, economic and financial affairs, including trade relations with foreign countries, all of which are independent from those of the Mainland. The PRC has also proposed to apply the principle in the [[Chinese unification|unification]] it aims for with [[Taiwan]].

==Background in the context of Hong Kong== 
{{main|History of Hong Kong}}
Hong Kong was a [[Crown colony|colony]] of the United Kingdom, ruled by a [[Governor of Hong Kong|governor]] appointed by [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|the monarchy of the United Kingdom]], for [[British Hong Kong|156 years]] from 1841 (except for four years of [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]] during [[WWII]]) until 1997, when it was [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|returned to Chinese sovereignty]]. China agreed to accept some conditions, as is stipulated in the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], such as the drafting and adoption of Hong Kong's "mini-constitution" [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]] before its return. The Hong Kong Basic Law ensured that Hong Kong will retain its [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[Economy of Hong Kong|economic system]] and own currency (the [[Hong Kong Dollar]]), [[Law of Hong Kong|legal system]], [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative system]], and same human rights and freedoms, as a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region (SAR) of China]] for 50 years. Set to expire in 2047, the current arrangement has permitted Hong Kong to function as its own entity under the name "Hong Kong, China" in many international settings (e.g. the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] and the Olympics).<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://gohongkong.about.com/od/travelplanner/a/hongkongcountry.htm|title=What Country Is Hong Kong in?

The Chinese [[Renminbi]] is not legal tender in Hong Kong. Likewise, the Hong Kong Dollar is not accepted in stores in mainland China. With this arrangement, a permit or special visa ({{zh|links=no|c=簽注}}) is required when passing between the borders of Hong Kong and mainland China, and people in Hong Kong hold [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport|Hong Kong SAR passports]] rather than [[Chinese passport]]s. The [[Languages of Hong Kong|official languages]] are a major factor besides the [[History of Hong Kong|history of the former colony]] that has made Hong Kong and mainland  China distinct from each other, as [[Cantonese]] and [[Hong Kong English|English]] are the most widely used languages in Hong Kong while [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] is the official language of mainland China. The [[Government of China|central government in Beijing]] maintains control over Hong Kong's foreign affairs as well as the legal interpretation of the Basic Law. The latter has led democracy advocates and some Hong Kong residents to argue that the territory has yet to achieve [[universal suffrage]] as promised by the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], leading to [[Umbrella Revolution|mass demonstrations in 2014]].<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto1"/><ref name="auto2"/>

{{Politics of China |expanded = Taiwan-HK-Macau }}

[[Deng Xiaoping]] proposed to apply the principle to Hong Kong in the negotiation with the British Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]] over the future of Hong Kong when the lease of the [[New Territories]] (including [[New Kowloon]]) of Hong Kong to the United Kingdom was to expire in 1997. The same principle was proposed in talks with [[Portugal]] about Macau.

The principle is that, upon reunification, despite the practice of [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialism in mainland China]], both Hong Kong and Macau, which were colonies of the UK and Portugal respectively, can retain their established system under a high degree of autonomy for up to 50 years after reunification. However, what will happen after 2047 (Hong Kong) and 2049 (Macau) has never been publicly stated.

Chapter 1, Article 5 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], the [[constitutional document]] of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, reads:<ref name="HKBasicLawChapter1">{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html|title=Chapter I : General Principles|publisher=[[Government of Hong Kong|Government of the Hong Kong SAR]]|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=1 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123110932/http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html|archive-date=23 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The establishment of these regions, called [[special administrative region (People's Republic of China)|"special administrative regions"]] (SARs), is authorised by Article 31 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], which states that the State may establish SARs when necessary, and that the systems to be instituted in them shall be prescribed by law enacted by the [[National People's Congress]] in light of the specific conditions.

The SARs of Hong Kong and Macau were formally established on [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|1 July 1997]] and [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|20 December 1999]] respectively, immediately after the People's Republic of China (PRC) assumed the sovereignty over the respective regions.

===Framework===
The two SARs of Hong Kong and Macau are responsible for their domestic affairs including, but not limited to, the [[judiciary]] and [[Court of Final Appeal (disambiguation)|courts of final appeal (last resort)]], immigration and customs, [[public finance]], [[currency|currencies]] and [[extradition]]. Important cultural effects are exemption of the SARs from mainland laws mandating the use of [[simplified characters]] in publishing and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] in public education and most broadcasting. The [[diplomatic relations]] and [[defense (military)|military defence]] of the two SARs however, is the responsibility of the [[Central People's Government]] in Beijing.

Hong Kong continues using [[English law#common law|English common law]] while Macau continues using the [[Portuguese law|Portuguese]] [[civil law (legal system)|civil law system]].

===Implementation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}
In Hong Kong, the system has been implemented through the Basic Law of Hong Kong, which serves as the "mini-constitution" of the region, and consistent with the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Similar arrangements are in place with Macau. Under the respective basic laws, the SARs have a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. They formulate their own monetary and financial policies, maintain their own currencies, formulate their own policies on education, culture, sports, social welfare system, etc. within the framework of the basic laws.

As stipulated by the Basic Law, while the Central People's Government of the PRC is responsible for foreign affairs and defence in relation to the SARs, representatives of the Government of the SARs may participate, as members of delegations of the PRC, in diplomatic negotiations that directly affect the Regions, and in other international organisations or conferences limited to states and affecting the region. For those international organisations and conferences not limited to states, the SARs may participate using the names in the form of ''Hong Kong, China'' and ''Macau, China''. As separate economic entities, both SARs of Hong Kong and Macau are members of the [[World Trade Organization]]. Hong Kong is also one of the member economies of [[APEC]].

The Hong Kong Basic Law also provides constitutional protection on various fundamental human rights and freedoms; specifically, these rights are covered in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and international labour conventions which are implemented under Article 39 of the Hong Kong Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. Nonetheless, the governments of the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong both consider the principle to have been successfully implemented, quoting official reports of both the United Kingdom and the United States.

The [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|Central People's Government]] in Beijing maintain relations with Hong Kong government through the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] in Hong Kong. For Macau, Beijing uses the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao Special Administrative Region]] in Macau. While the counterpart offices of the Hong Kong government for the Central People's Government in Beijing is the [[Office of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Beijing]], and Macau government's office in Beijing is the [[Office of the Macau Special Administrative Region in Beijing]].

=== Potential extension ===
Several high level members of the government have expressed a potential extension of the system beyond 2047 for Hong Kong. In January 2020, Carrie Lam stated that "My view is this: as long as we persist with the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, push forward the implementation of 'One Country, Two Systems' and have a full understanding and implementation of the principle... then we have adequate reason to believe that 'One Country, Two Systems' will be implemented smoothly and in the long term, and it will not change after 2047."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-01-16|title='One Country, Two Systems' could remain unchanged after 2047, says Hong Kong's Carrie Lam|url=https://hongkongfp.com/2020/01/16/one-country-two-systems-remain-unchanged-2047-says-hong-kongs-carrie-lam/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Additionally, in a June 2020 online webinar to campaign for the [[Hong Kong national security law|National Security Law]], [[Zhang Xiaoming]] said that the National Security Law would ensure that the freedoms granted to the city can be extended beyond 2047.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-08|title=Security law to extend, not erode Hong Kong freedoms beyond 2047|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3088031/deng-xiaoping-always-believed-mainland-could-step-if|access-date=2020-10-28|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}</ref> However, neither Carrie Lam or Zhang Xiaoming have promised such an extension or laid out concrete steps or goals in order for it to happen.

=== Perceptions of the erosion of autonomy of Hong Kong ===
After Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, Beijing promised that the Hong Kong citizens would be free to elect their local government. However, the Basic Law negotiated between China and Britain does not have a clear timetable for when Universal Suffrage is to be achieved but ultimately just agreed upon that a full vote by the populace and universal suffrage must be reached before the end of the 50-year transition according to Article 45.<ref name="mobile.abc.net.au">{{Cite web|url=https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-16/was-hong-kong-ever-promised-democracy-fact-check/5809964|title=Fact check: Was Hong Kong ever promised democracy? - Fact Check - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|website=mobile.abc.net.au|access-date=19 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103144602/https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-16/was-hong-kong-ever-promised-democracy-fact-check/5809964|archive-date=3 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/10/opinion/an-alternative-view-of-hong-kong/|title=Asia Times {{!}} An alternative view of HK protests {{!}} Opinion|last=|first=|website=Asia Times|date=2 October 2019|language=en|access-date=19 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012003920/https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/10/opinion/an-alternative-view-of-hong-kong/|archive-date=12 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Currently the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) would only allow Hong Kong to vote for candidates who had been selected by Beijing. One of the reasons for the protests by Hong Kong's citizens and students was because Beijing suggested 2017 as a "possible" date to implement universal suffrage,<ref name="mobile.abc.net.au"/> but that did not happen in 2017; thus, they demanded "true universal suffrage."<ref name="refa1" />

Several incidents have caused portions of the Hong Kong public to call into question the PRC's pledge to allow a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong. Some international observers and human rights organisations have expressed doubts about the future of the political freedoms currently enjoyed in Hong Kong.

In the year after the Handover, surveys showed high levels of satisfaction with Beijing's hands-off relationship with the former colony.<ref name="Concise">{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=John M|title=A Concise History of Hong Kong|date=2007|publisher=[[Hong Kong University Press]]|isbn=978-962-209-878-7|pages=221–228}}</ref>

The year before, the Provisional Legislative Council passed laws restricting the [[right of abode]], leading to a case brought against the government, which ended in a loss for the government in the Court of Final Appeal in 1999. The government then took its case to the National People's Congress. The legal establishment expressed its disapproval of the act Martin Lee described as "giving away" Hong Kong's autonomy with a silent march. Polls showed the events had depressed the public's confidence in the government, despite the fact that most were in favour of the government's stance over that of the court's.<ref name=Concise/>

The proposals in [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Article 23 of the Basic Law]] in 2003 (which were withdrawn due to mass opposition) were claimed to undermine autonomy.

During the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], students demanded more political freedom in direct response to the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|"831 decision" of the NPCSC]]. The participants demanded freedom of choice, electoral freedom, democracy and, in particular, they wanted to participate in the elections of the head of the administration of Hong Kong. The name "umbrella movement" originated because the students protected themselves with umbrellas from the pepper spray of the police. Thus, umbrellas became the symbol of this movement.<ref name="refa1" /> In 2016, Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law, student leaders of the protests, were indicted for their roles in the protests and found guilty.

On 16 June 2016, shortly after he returned to Hong Kong, [[Lam Wing-kee]] gave a long press conference in which he detailed the circumstances surrounding his eight-month detention, and describing how his confession and those of his associates had been scripted and stage-managed. Lam implicated the involvement of the [[Central Investigation Team]], which is under direct control of the highest level of the Beijing leadership. His revelations stunned Hong Kong and made headlines worldwide, prompting a flurry of counter-accusations and denials from mainland authorities and supporters.<ref name="AutoRQ-1">{{cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/18/1000-protesters-chant-no-authority-support-returned-bookseller/|title=In Pictures: Over 1,000 protesters chant 'no to authority' in support of returned bookseller - Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|date=18 June 2016|publisher=|access-date=17 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009000449/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/18/1000-protesters-chant-no-authority-support-returned-bookseller/|archive-date=9 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=20160616hongkongfp>{{cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/16/breaking-returned-bookseller-says-he-was-detained-by-a-special-unit-in-china-confession-was-scripted/|title=Returned bookseller says he was detained by 'special unit' in China, TV 'confession' was scripted|date=16 June 2016|work=hongkongfp.com|access-date=17 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009000334/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/16/breaking-returned-bookseller-says-he-was-detained-by-a-special-unit-in-china-confession-was-scripted/|archive-date=9 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Hong Kong National Party ban ====
{{main|Hong Kong National Party}}
On 17 July 2018, the [[Hong Kong Police Force]] served the party convener a notice under the [[Societies Ordinance]], seeking to ban the Party for [[sedition]], on grounds of national security with respect to [[PRC|Chinese]] territorial integrity. The party and its convener Andy Chan submitted their case against being outlawed. Ten days later, in an unprecedented move, Secretary for Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] on 24 September 2018 officially banned the party on national security grounds.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong National Party's call for 'armed revolution' no mere political slogan but a threat to safety and order, security minister John Lee says|date=24 September 2018|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2165439/hong-kong-issues-unprecedented-ban-separatist-party|access-date=15 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926062421/https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2165439/hong-kong-issues-unprecedented-ban-separatist-party|archive-date=26 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The ban prohibited anyone who claims to be a HKNP member, or is found to provide aid to the party in any way, under the threat of being fined and jailed for up to two years. The definition of “providing aid” to the party and the two leaders were not made clear. Chan's lawyers wrote to the Department of Justice seeking an assurance that providing legal assistance to him would not be regarded as providing assistance to the HKNP, but that assurance was not forthcoming.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lum|first1=Alvin|title=Hong Kong National Party founders lodge separate appeals against ban in effort to avoid legal action|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2170054/hong-kong-separatist-party-founders-andy-chan-and-chow-ho|accessdate=24 October 2018|work=South China Morning Post|date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024125720/https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2170054/hong-kong-separatist-party-founders-andy-chan-and-chow-ho|archive-date=24 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

There has been a widespread response opposing the law: nationally and internationally.

===Background in the context of Macau===
{{main|History of Macau}}
Macau was a [[Crown colony|colony]] of [[Portugal]], ruled by a [[Governor of Macau|governor]] for [[Portuguese Macau|442 years]] from 1557 (except for 4 years of [[History of Macau#1938–1949: World War II|limited Japanese occupation]] during [[WWII]], because of Japanese respect to Portuguese neutrality) until 1999, when it was [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|returned to Chinese sovereignty]]. China had to accept some conditions, stipulated in the [[Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau]], such as the drafting and adoption of Macau's [[Macau Basic Law|mini-constitution]] before its return. Like Hong Kong, the [[Macau Basic Law|Basic Law]] ensured Macau will retain its [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[Economy of Macau|economic system]] and own currency (the [[Macanese pataca|pataca]]), [[Law of Macau|legal system]] (which is based on Portuguese civil law), [[Legislative Council of Macau|legislative system]], and people's rights and freedom for 50 years, as a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region (SAR) of China]]. Set to expire in 2049, the current agreement has permitted Macau to function as its own entity in many international settings (e.g., [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] and the Olympics) rather than as a part of China.

As Macau has its own currency, the Chinese [[renminbi]] is not legal tender in Macau; the pataca is not even accepted in stores in China. With this agreement, a permit or visa is required when crossing between the borders of Macau and China, and people in Macau generally hold [[Macau Special Administrative Region passport|Macau SAR passports]] rather than mainland Chinese passports. Like Hong Kong, the [[Languages of Macau|official languages]] are a major factor that has made Macau and China distinct from each other besides the [[History of Macau|history of the former colony]], as Cantonese and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are the most widely used languages in Macau, while [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] is the official language of China. The [[Government of China|central government in Beijing]] also maintains control over Macau's foreign affairs as well as the legal interpretation of the Basic Law.

==Taiwan==
{{see also|Chinese unification}}
This system has also been proposed by the PRC government for [[Taiwan]], but the [[Government of the Republic of China]] has refused this suggestion (it has also been previously claimed that the system was originally designed for Taiwan<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cooney |first1=Sean |title=Why Taiwan is not Hong Kong: A Review of the PRC's 'One Country Two Systems' Model for Reunification for Taiwan |journal=Pacific Rim Law & Policy Association |date=1997 |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=497-548 }}</ref> in order for it to be reunified with the PRC). More specifically, special provisions for the preservation of the military in Taiwan have also been proposed by the Chinese Communist Party (the ruling political party of the PRC), unlike that of Hong Kong and Macau, which are territories protected by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the PRC. All of the major political parties in Taiwan, however, including those that lean towards [[Chinese reunification]], have come out strongly against the "One country, Two systems". Some proposed instead "One country, Two governments", which was opposed outright by the PRC government, while some proposed that the "one country" highlighted in the system should be the ROC instead of the PRC. One of the few Taiwanese who have publicly supported the "One country, Two systems" is [[Li Ao]], a Mainland-born novelist.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Although the "one country, two systems" guarantees that Hong Kong's economic and [[political system]]s will not be changed for 50 years after the British handover in 1997, the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] of the Republic of China has cited 218 cases between 1997 and 2007 in which they claim the PRC has breached the right of the people of Hong Kong to self-rule and severely intervened in the judicial system as well as freedom of speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ws.mac.gov.tw/001/Upload/297/relfile/8478/72053/14f46a7e-e74d-4df7-8995-cca469878019.pdf|title=Analysis Report: 20 Years After Hong Kong's Handover|date=29 June 2006|work=Mainland Affairs Council|accessdate=3 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203180939/https://ws.mac.gov.tw/001/Upload/297/relfile/8478/72053/14f46a7e-e74d-4df7-8995-cca469878019.pdf|archive-date=3 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the accession of [[Hu Jintao]] as the [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party]] on 15 November 2002, the PRC stopped promoting immediate unification via "one country, two systems", although it remains official policy. The "one country, two systems" framework was not mentioned in the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] passed on 14 March 2005 to prevent the growing [[Taiwan independence movement]] at that time. A new policy of gradual economic integration and political exchanges is now preferred under the [[1992 Consensus]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/op-ed/ohanlon/20050501.htm|title=The Risk of War Over Taiwan is Real|work=Financial Times|date=1 May 2005|accessdate=26 July 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231053934/http://www.brookings.edu/views/op-ed/ohanlon/20050501.htm|archivedate=31 December 2005}}</ref> this new policy was emphasised during the [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China]] in April 2005<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/Hopes-grow-as-second-Taiwan-leader-visits-China/2005/05/12/1115843308418.html|title=Hopes grow as second Taiwan leader visits China|date=13 May 2005|accessdate=26 July 2006|location=Melbourne|work=The Age|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506022258/http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/Hopes-grow-as-second-Taiwan-leader-visits-China/2005/05/12/1115843308418.html|archive-date=6 May 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> as well as all subsequent major cross-strait exchanges, especially after [[Ma Ying-jeou]] from the pro-reunification [[Kuomintang]] party won the [[2008 Republic of China presidential election]].

Due to the growing pressure for the pro-independence [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) to engage in the cross-strait development over the past recent years developed by KMT-CPC, the DPP finally softened its stance on its [[Taiwan independence movement]] when the former chairman [[Frank Hsieh]] visited Mainland China on 4–8 October 2012, a groundbreaking visit by the highest rank in DPP, although he claimed that this trip was done in his private capacity and as a non-politician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/10/02/2003544157|title=Frank Hsieh confirms visit to China – Taipei Times|date=2 October 2012|accessdate=12 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029144639/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/10/02/2003544157|archive-date=29 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The DPP also established its party China Affairs Committee on 21 November 2012<ref>[http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=12196 "General news: Su to Chair DPP’s 'China Affairs Committee'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029142725/http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=12196 |date=29 October 2014 }}.

==Comparison to proposals for Tibet==
Jiang (2008) notes that the concept of "one country, two systems" is based on the [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet]] signed in 1951, and that its mechanism is similar to how the Qing emperor integrated new territories it had conquered by permitting local elites in these regions to continue to enjoy power for a time and to exercise autonomy without apparently threatening distinct local customs. As the concept was merely a "tactical and transitional arrangement", a point of view argues that the territory of Hong Kong will gradually experience the same fate as Tibet since 1959 – forced assimilation and tight direct control by the central government. Over time, full assimilation, and abolition of local autonomy, would take place in a manner "illustrative of a similar Chinese imperial expansionist mentalité".<ref name=japanfocus>Hung, Ho-fung.

The [[14th Dalai Lama]]'s 2005 proposal for "high-level autonomy" for [[Tibet]], evolved from a position of advocating Tibetan independence, has been compared to "one country, two systems". He has said that his proposals should be acceptable to China because "one country, two systems" is accommodated for in the Chinese Constitution. State media rejected this claim, pointing out that "one country, two systems" was designed for the capitalist social systems of Hong Kong and Macau, which had never existed in Tibet.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/zgxz/t265334.htm|title="One country, two systems" not possible for Tibet|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=24 August 2010|work=China Tibet Information Center|publisher=Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the United States|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710091113/http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/zgxz/t265334.htm|archive-date=10 July 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, Dalai Lama mentioned again that the [[Seventeen Point Agreement]] was signed in the spirit of "one country, two systems".<ref>[https://www.dalailama.com/news/2012/his-holiness-speaks-to-chinese-students-in-rochester-mn/amp  His Holiness speaks to Chinese students in Rochester, MN] April 23, 2012</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrXhE0RFtXg?t=698 Dalai Lama Speaks to Chinese Students in MN (1 of 3)] May 5, 2012</ref>

Muhammad Cohen, writing for ''[[Asia Times]]'', suggests the "one country, two systems" formula is a possible solution to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Try 'one country, two systems' where it might work|url=http://www.asiatimes.com/try-one-country-two-systems-might-work/|last=|first=|date=26 June 2017|work=Asia Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918062622/http://www.asiatimes.com/try-one-country-two-systems-might-work//|archive-date=18 September 2017|access-date=18 September 2017}}</ref>

Irish Foreign Minister [[Simon Coveney]] said the arrangement linking Hong Kong with China could be a possible solution for addressing the fate of [[Northern Ireland]] after [[Brexit]].
