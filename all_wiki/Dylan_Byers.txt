While at ''Politico'', Byers wrote "“President Obama, off the record," an article providing readers a glimpse into an ‘off the record’ side of US President [[Barack Obama]]. For that story, he was a finalist in the 2014 [[Mirror Awards]] competition for Best Single Article in Digital Media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/media/story/2014/04/2014-mirror-awards-finalists-announced-001978|title=2014 Mirror Awards finalists announced|website= politico.com| first= Johana| last= Bhuiyan| date= April 1, 2014| access-date= November 8, 2016}}</ref>

In September 2015, fellow media reporter [[Brian Stelter]] announced that Byers was joining CNN.<ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.thewrap.com/dylan-byers-jumps-to-cnn-from-politico/|title=Dylan Byers Jumps to CNN From Politico| date= September 2, 2015 | website= TheWrap.com | first= Jordan| last= Burchette |language=en-US| access-date= November 8, 2016}}</ref> In his announcement, Stelter wrote, "Byers is a scoop machine ...

==Controversy==
In 2012, Byers drew scrutiny when he reported in ''Politico'' that US President Barack Obama's girlfriend in ''[[Dreams from My Father]]'' was a [[composite character]], which was already acknowledged by Obama in the book. ''Politico'' issued an extensive correction at the top of the original article.<ref>{{cite news |last=Byers |first=Dylan |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/05/obama-new-york-girlfriend-was-composite-122272 |title=Obama: 'New York girlfriend' was composite |work=Politico |date=May 2, 2012 |accessdate=May 6, 2017 }}</ref>

Byers was also criticized for  "Turbulence at The Times," a critical profile about former ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' executive editor [[Jill Abramson]], which quoted many anonymous staffers who said she was difficult to work with. Several commentators labeled Byers's piece as sexist.<ref>{{cite news |last=Linabary |first=Jasmine |url= http://genderreport.com/2013/04/28/on-politico-and-the-criticism-of-jill-abramson/ |title=On Politico and the criticism of Jill Abramson |work=The Gender Report |date=April 28, 2013 |accessdate=September 5, 2015 }}</ref>  Abramson was let go from the New York Times the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-jill-abramson-was-fired|title=Why Jill Abramson Was Fired|last=Auletta|first=Ken|date=2014-05-14|access-date=2019-02-07|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>

In 2017, [[Sean Hannity]] and [[Juan Williams]] challenged portions of a Byers CNN report. Byers reported that three sources stated an on-air dispute between the two lead to Hannity aiming a gun at Williams off air. Byers reported that it was just Hannity "showing off" but was disturbing to Williams and others present. Fox News investigated and "found that no one was put in any danger". Hannity later said the gun was not loaded and "Never pointed at anybody." Williams said the story was being sensationalized and that he did not feel he had been in harm's way.<ref>{{cite news |last=D'Zurilla |first=Christie |url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-march-sean-hannity-juan-williams-reject-1489763895-htmlstory.html |title=Sean Hannity, Juan Williams reject gun story as 'sensationalized'; CNN defends report |work=LA Times |date=March 17, 2017 |accessdate=March 17, 2017 }}</ref>

On November 21, 2017, Byers posted a tweet on his account implying that the [[Weinstein effect|recent sexual harassment scandals in media and entertainment]] were draining those industries of talent. The tweet was later deleted.<ref>{{cite news |last=Byers |first=Dylan |url=http://www.thewrap.com/cnn-reporter-dlyan-byers-tweet-drain-talent-sexual-harassment/ |title=CNN Reporter Apologizes for ‘Embarrassing’ Tweet on ‘Drain of Talent’ After Harassment Scandals |work=The Wrap|date=November 22, 2017 |accessdate=November 22, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Byers |first=Dylan |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/22/liberal-cnn-reporter-under-fire-after-tweeting-that-sex-allegations-are-draining-talent-from-media-entertainment.html |title=Liberal CNN reporter under fire after tweeting that sex allegations are draining talent from media, entertainment |work=Fox News|date=November 22, 2017 |accessdate=November 22, 2017 }}</ref>
