''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the stated aim of the book was to offer an intimate view of what it was like for Clinton to run as the first female presidential candidate from a major party in United States history, in an often vicious and turbulent campaign. This is her third memoir, following ''[[Living History (book)|Living History]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Hard Choices]]'' in 2014; advance publicity for the work said it would be her "most personal" yet<ref name=revealed/> and quoted from her words in the book's Introduction: "In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I've often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net.

== Contents ==

''What Happened'' is a first-person account<ref name=chicagotribunereview/> dedicated to "the team that stood with me in 2016,"<ref>''What Happened'', p. 465.</ref> and one of its chapters is largely a list of everyone who worked on her campaign.<ref name =ew/> It is organized into six main parts, entitled: Perseverance, Competition, Sisterhood, Idealism and Realism, Frustration, and Resilience. Each part has from two to five chapters within it.<ref>''What Happened'', pp. viii-ix.</ref>

After the introduction, the book opens with a scene from the [[Inauguration_of_Donald_Trump|United States presidential inauguration of 2017]],<ref name =ew/> attended by Clinton and her husband, where she watched President Donald Trump take office. She begins:

{{quote|Deep breath. Feel the air fill my lungs. This is the right thing to do. The country needs to see that our democracy still works, no matter how painful this is. Breathe out. Scream later.<ref>What Happened, p. 3.</ref>}}

In the next chapter, "Get Caught Trying," she starts with her reasoning for running: {{quote| I ran for President because I thought I'd be good at the job. I thought that of all the people who might run, I had the most relevant experience, meaningful accomplishments, and ambitious but achievable proposals, as well as the temperament to get things done in Washington.<ref>What Happened, p. 39</ref>}}

Further in, she elaborates: 

{{Quote|text=It was the chance to do the most good I would ever be able to do. In just one day at the White House, you can get more done for more people than in months anywhere else. We had to build an economy that worked for everyone. We had to take on serious national security threats. These issues were already on my mind all the time.... I knew I would make the most of every minute. Once I started thinking about it that way, I couldn't stop.|sign=|source=What Happened, p. 52}}

In the book, she defends her campaign, saying they were economical with travel expenses, snacks, and office supplies.<ref>''What Happened'', pp. 97-98.</ref> "Our national campaign staff [were] living and working on a tight budget..." She revealed that the average donation was $100 and that the majority were from women.<ref>''What Happened'', pp. 98.</ref>

She also describes campaigning in hostile areas of the country, like [[Mingo County, West Virginia]], "Ground Zero for the coal crisis."<ref>What Happened, p. 272</ref> She describes being taken aback by the level of anger she was met there with. She wrote, "This wasn't just about my comments in one town hall. This was something deeper."<ref>What Happened, p. 273</ref>

In the book, also, Clinton tries to explain the combination of factors that led to her electoral loss, including [[James Comey]], [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Mitch McConnell]], ''The New York Times'', [[NBC]],<ref>''What Happened'', pp. 221-23.</ref> [[WikiLeaks]],<ref>''What Happened'', pp. 339-40.</ref> the  American media as a whole,<ref>What Happened, p. 222-23</ref> [[sexism]], [[white resentment]], [[Bernie Sanders]] and his supporters, [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Jill Stein]], and herself, specifically her comments on putting "coal miners out of business" and labeling her opponent's supporters as a "[[basket of deplorables]]".<ref>{{cite news |last=Zurcher |first=Anthony |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41244474 |title=What Happened: The long list of who Hillary Clinton blames |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=ew/><ref name=people>{{cite web|author=Allison Adato |url=http://people.com/books/hillary-clinton-what-happened-book-review/ |title=Hillary Clinton's What Happened: Book Review |publisher=PEOPLE.com |date=2017-09-12 |accessdate=2018-02-12}}</ref> 

She noted that [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] worried that extending the handover process after Trump's win would be bad for the country. She wrote "After so much hand-wringing about Trump undermining our democracy by not pledging to accept the results, the pressure was on us to do it right. If I was going to lose, the President wanted me to concede quickly and gracefully. It was hard to think straight, but I agreed with him."<ref>''What Happened'', p 385.</ref>

The book contains a number of Clinton's policy proposals, featuring her analysis of a problem area and her ideas for how to solve it<ref name =guardfrank/> like resolving the issues of climate change<ref>What Happened, p. 283</ref> and securing the vote.<ref>What Happened, p. 498.</ref> It also says though she was ecstatic about [[Barack Obama]]'s win in 2008, "in some ways, the [moment with Trump as president] now feels even more hopeful, because it is a battle-hardened hope, tempered by loss and clear-eyed about the stakes.... We are doing the work.<ref>What Happened, p. 501.</ref>

Another subject of the book is how to get through difficult experiences. Clinton discusses her practice of [[yoga]] and her liking of [[chardonnay]],<ref name="books" /> but in particular, she lists a large number of books that helped her cope with the loss in one way or another. These included mysteries by [[Louise Penny]], [[Jacqueline Winspear]], [[Donna Leon]], and [[Caroline and Charles Todd]]. They also included the [[Neapolitan Novels]] of [[Elena Ferrante]], the spiritual works of [[Henri Nouwen]], and the collected poems of [[Maya Angelou]], [[Marge Piercy]] and [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref name="books">{{cite web|last=Hohmann |first=James |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/presidential/the-reading-list-that-helped-hillary-clinton-cope-20170918.html?mobi=true |title=The reading list that helped Hillary Clinton cope |publisher=Philly |date=2017-09-18 |accessdate=2018-02-12}}</ref>

''What Happened''  closes with a scene from a speech she gave at her alma mater [[Wellesley College]].<ref name=guardfrank/> Clinton concludes it with the advice to readers to "Keep going."<ref name =ulin/>

<blockquote>I think the first woman candidate for President, the one who won the popular vote, has every right to offer her own take on the election. But bear in mind that many — if not all — of the people tearing down Clinton and her new memoir, ''What Happened'', haven't actually read it. Bear in mind, too, that few — if any — of these same people called out Bernie Sanders for writing his own campaign memoir, one that dropped just days post-election. No, there's some sort of special virulence reserved for Clinton. And she gets it. In fact, she spends much of ''What Happened'' parsing that very question.<ref name="ew">{{cite web|last=Jordan|first=Tina|url= http://ew.com/books/2017/09/12/hillary-clinton-memoir-what-happened-review/|title=Hillary Clinton is upset about a lot of things in What Happened: EW review|date=September 12, 2017|access-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Jennifer Senior of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said:

<blockquote>"What Happened" is not one book, but many. It is a candid and blackly funny account of her mood in the direct aftermath of losing to President Donald J. Trump. It is a post-mortem, in which she is both coroner and corpse. It is a feminist manifesto. It is a score-settling jubilee. It is a rant against James B. Comey, Bernie Sanders, the media, James B. Comey, Vladimir Putin and James B. Comey. It is a primer on Russian spying. It is a thumping of Trump.<ref name="senior" /></blockquote>

For [[The Washington Post|''The'' ''Washington Post'']], writer [[David Weigel]] noted that Clinton "apologizes to the reader, who has to relive all of this. 'It wasn't healthy or productive,' she writes, 'to dwell on the ways I felt I'd been shivved.' It's a perfect word, 'shivved.' The Hillary Clinton of this bitter memoir ... again and again ... blames herself for losing, apologizing for her 'dumb' email management, for giving paid speeches to banks, for saying she would put coal miners 'out of business.' She veers between regret and righteous, sometimes in the same paragraph."<ref name="weigel">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/clintons-account-of-how-she-was-shivved-in-the-2016-presidential-election/2017/09/11/f6740438-957f-11e7-89fa-bb822a46da5b_story.html|title=Clinton's account of how she was 'shivved' in the 2016 presidential election|first=David|last=Weigel|date=September 12, 2017|access-date=September 30, 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}</ref>

A review in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' by Heidi Stevens stated that the passages in the book about Russia's involvement in the US election "read like a spy novel".<ref name="chicagotribunereview">{{cite news|last1=Stevens|first1=Heidi|title=Hillary Clinton in new book 'What Happened' shoulders blame, takes aim|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/stevens/ct-life-stevens-tuesday-hillary-clinton-book-0912-story.html|access-date=September 14, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|date=September 12, 2017}}</ref> [[Thomas Frank]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' contends that "Unfortunately, her new book is less an effort to explain than it is to explain away. ...

An analysis by [[Ezra Klein]], editor-in-chief of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'', saw a different role for the book, making reference to Clinton's belief that progress is best made by working within the political system: "''What Happened'' has been sold as Clinton's apologia for her 2016 campaign, and it is that. But it's more remarkable for Clinton's extended defense of a political style that has become unfashionable in both the Republican and Democratic parties."<ref name = "ezra" >{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/13/16298120/hillary-clinton-what-happened-interview|title=What Hillary Clinton really thinks|date=September 13, 2017|website=Vox.com|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref>

David L. Ulin of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in his review for the newspaper that the book is a "necessary — if at times clunky and unconvincing — retrospective" and that "She should have been president, and she knows it; regret and loss is palpable throughout the book. And yet it's also the case that she remains unable to reckon with just what happened in the 2016 election, looking for explanations, for reasons, while at the same time never quite uncovering her own complicity."<ref name="ulin" >{{cite web|author=David L.

Sarah Jones of ''[[The New Republic]]'' wrote: 

<blockquote>The real problem with ''What Happened'' is that it is not the book it needed to be. It spends more time on descriptions of Clinton's various post-election coping strategies, which include chardonnay and "alternative nostril breathing," than it does on her campaign decisions in the Midwest. It is written for her fans, in other words, and not for those who want real answers about her campaign, and who worry that the Democratic Party is learning the wrong lessons from the 2016 debacle.<ref name="jones" /></blockquote>

[[Jeff Greenfield]] wrote in ''[[Politico Magazine]]'' that the book suggests "that the person we've seen over the past quarter-century, and the person we watched seek the presidency twice, ''is'' the authentic Hillary. In fact, to judge by her book, she may have been the most authentic person in the race."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Greenfield |first1=Jeff |title=The Strange Authenticity of Hillary Clinton |work=[[Politico]] |date=2017-09-20 |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/20/hillary-clinton-book-what-happened-authenticity-real-215627 |accessdate=2017-09-21 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

It was announced on August 28, 2017, that Hillary Clinton would be starting a North American book tour in September 2017 to promote ''What Happened'', as well as the picture book '' [[It Takes a Village#Picture book|It Takes a Village]]'' (a new take on that 1996 volume).

Clinton scheduled more than thirty appearances in cities across the United States and Canada as part of an official book tour which lasted through December 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/hillary-clinton-book-tour-vip-tickets-657995|title=VIP TICKETS FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S BOOK TOUR COST OVER $2,000|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=August 31, 2017|access-date=September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/hillary-clintons-2017-book-tour-comes-to-an-end/article/2643719|title=Hillary Clinton's 2017 book tour comes to an end|work=[[Washington Examiner]]|last=Lim|first=Naomi|date=December 15, 2017|access-date=January 8, 2017}}</ref>

===Book signings===
In addition to ''Hillary Clinton Live'' events, Clinton also held book signings at locations across the United States as part of her book tour.

Tickets for particular signings sold out very soon after going on sale. For instance, tickets to Clinton's signing at Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena sold out within ninety minutes. The president of Vroman's Bookstore reported that it was the fastest that the store had ever sold out for an event.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/2017/11/30/hillary-clinton-to-appear-at-sold-out-vromans-bookstore-event-tomorrow/ |title=Hillary Clinton to appear at sold-out Vroman's Bookstore event Friday |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=November 30, 2017 |website=www.pasadenastarnews.com |publisher=Pasadena Star News |access-date=December 23, 2017 }}</ref>

In the United States, some of the book tour's stops were located relatively near Chappaqua, New York, where Clinton maintains her personal residence. She also held book signings in California or Colorado.
