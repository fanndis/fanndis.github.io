'''Enrico Anthony Lazio''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|z|i|.|oʊ}}; born March 13, 1958) is a former four-term [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from the [[State of New York]]. Lazio became well-known during his bid for [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in [[United States Senate election in New York, 2000|New York's 2000 Senate election]]; he was defeated by [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]].  Lazio also ran unsuccessfully for the 2010 [[New York State]] [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] Party gubernatorial nomination.<ref>http://lazio.com/p.cfm?s=1000&p=448</ref>

==Early life, education and career==
Lazio was born in [[Amityville, New York]], in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], on Long Island. He is the son of Olive (née Christensen) and Anthony Lazio, who owned an automotive parts store. His father was of Italian descent and his maternal grandparents were Danish immigrants.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/05/nyregion/growing-ambition-special-report-behind-lazio-smile-lies-deliberate-pragmatic.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Dan | last=Barry | title=A GROWING AMBITION: A special report.; Behind the Lazio Smile Lies a Deliberate and Pragmatic Substance | date=July 5, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/politics/newyork/features/3492/|work=New York|first=Chris|last=Smith|title=Which Rick Do You Pick?}}</ref> He graduated from [[West Islip High School]] in 1976. He received his A.B. from [[Vassar College]] in 1980 and received his [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[Washington College of Law]] at [[American University]].

Prior to being elected to Congress, Lazio was appointed executive assistant district attorney for Suffolk County in 1987,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jessica|first1=Winum|title=Four Housemates on Top of the World: Politician, CEO, Media Mogul, and Entrepreneur|url=https://vq.vassar.edu/issues/2000/04/beyond-vassar/housemates.html|website=Vassar Quarterly}}</ref> and served in the Suffolk County Legislature from 1990 to 1993.<ref name="opensecrets">{{cite web|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=27868|website=Open Secrets|title=Revolving Door: Rick A Lazio Employment Summary}}</ref> 

==U.S. Representative==
Lazio represented [[New York's 2nd congressional district]] as a Republican. He was first elected in 1992, defeating the incumbent, [[Thomas Downey]], who had served for eighteen years.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baranel|first1=Josh|title=THE 1992 ELECTION: NEW YORK STATE -- U.S. HOUSE RACES; Green and Downey Lose as New York State Delegation Changes Dramatically|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/04/nyregion/1992-election-new-york-state-us-house-races-green-downey-lose-new-york-state.html|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Lazio served four terms from 1993 to 2001.<ref name="opensecrets"/>

In Congress, Lazio served as Deputy Majority [[Whip (politics)|Whip]], Assistant Majority Leader, and Chairman of the [[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity|House Banking Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity]]. He was "widely viewed as the most influential moderate in a leadership dominated by conservatives."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dao|first1=James|title=TIES THAT BIND: A special report.; Lazio's G.O.P.

Enacted into law in 1996, NAHASDA provides housing assistance to Native American communities. It also created a new HUD division, which combined several pre-existing programs into a single block grant program committed to the task of tribal housing.

Outside of the housing area, Lazio introduced the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, which allowed Americans with disabilities to enter the workforce while maintaining their health insurance. That legislation also passed and was signed into law.

During his time in Congress, Lazio championed the case to award a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor to President Theodore Roosevelt for his charge up San Juan Hill in the Spanish–American War.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kilian|first1=Michael|title=Teddy's Rough Ride|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-11-11/features/9811110318_1_tweed-roosevelt-san-juan-hill-teddy-roosevelt|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=November 11, 1998}}</ref> Congress eventually passed legislation asking the president to grant the honor, and President Clinton awarded the medal in January 2001.<ref>{{cite news|title=Medal Of Honor For Teddy Roosevelt|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-01-12/news/0101120184_1_tweed-roosevelt-san-juan-hill-spanish-american-war|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=January 12, 2001}}</ref> Lazio also sponsored the Wartime Violation of Italian American Civil Liberties Act, which, after being passed and signed into law in 2000, directed the U.S. Attorney General to review the government's internment of Italian nationals during World War II. 
In addition to his position on the Financial Services Committee, Lazio also served on the House's [[Energy and Commerce Committee]], and on the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States.

==2000 U.S. Senate campaign==
In 2000, Lazio ran for the U.S. Senate from [[New York (state)|New York]] and was defeated by [[Hillary Clinton]] in the race to succeed [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]]. His comparatively late entry into the race (five months before [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]) followed New York City [[List of mayors of New York City|Mayor]] [[Rudolph Giuliani]]'s decision to withdraw from the Senate race. Lazio announced his candidacy for Senate on all five major [[Sunday morning talk shows]] on the same day, making him the second person ever to complete a [[Full Ginsburg]].<ref>"Lazio's Coming Out Party" '' Slate. '' May 22, 2000. http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/pundit_central/2000/05/lazios_coming_out_party.html</ref>

During the senatorial campaign, Lazio was asked by the SEC to produce documents relating to his [[stock option]] trading in discount stock brokerage Quick & Reilly, a division of [[FleetBoston Financial]]. After Lazio responded to the inquiry, the SEC took no further action.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The race between Lazio and Hillary Clinton became the most expensive Senate campaign ever conducted at the time.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Levy|first1=Clifford|title=Lazio Sets Spending Mark for a Losing Senate Bid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/13/nyregion/lazio-sets-spending-mark-for-a-losing-senate-bid.html|work=The New York Times}}</ref> In a September 13, 2000 debate, Lazio left his podium and asked Clinton to sign a document affirming a pledge to abstain from benefiting from "soft money." Clinton refused. Years later, Lazio acknowledged regretting the style with which he made his point, but maintained that "[o]n substance, it was right."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/lazio-admits-mistake-in-debate-with-clinton-1.883924|title=Lazio admits mistake in debate with Clinton|last1=October 1|first1=REID J. EPSTEIN|last2=Pm|first2=2008 8:33|website=Newsday|language=en|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref>

Lazio had given up his House seat to run for Senate. Following his loss in the Senate election, he became CEO of the [[Financial Services Forum]], and, later, the managing director of global real assets for [[JPMorgan]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vielkind|first1=Jimmy|title=Lazio's 2009 JPMorgan Bonus: $1.3 Million|url=http://observer.com/2009/12/lazios-2009-jpmorgan-bonus-13-million/|publisher=Observer}}</ref>

On June 2, 2010, Lazio received the New York State Republican Party's designation to run for governor, but [[Carl Paladino]], a candidate backed by the Tea Party movement,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city/article187686.ece|title=Long Islanders put Paladino to test as their cup of tea|publisher=Buffalo News|date=September 12, 2010}}</ref> petitioned his way onto the ballot<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2010/07/21/paladino-on-gop-ballot/|title=Paladino on GOP ballot|first=Post Staff|last=Report|date=July 21, 2010}}</ref> and defeated Lazio in the Republican gubernatorial primary on September 14, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/nyregion/15webnygov.html|title=Paladino Stuns N.Y.

==Private legal practice==

Since 2012, Lazio has led the New York office and the national housing finance practice group of Jones Walker LLP, a 400-lawyer law firm headquartered in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He sits on the executive committee of the J. Ronald Terwilliger Foundation for Housing America's Families,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jrthousing.org/leadership/|website=The J.
