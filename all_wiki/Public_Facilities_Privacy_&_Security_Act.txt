The '''Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act''', commonly known as '''House Bill 2''' or '''HB2''', is a [[North Carolina]] [[statute]] passed in March 2016 and signed into law by [[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]] [[Pat McCrory]]. The bill amended state law to preempt any anti-discrimination ordinances passed by local communities and, controversially, compelled schools and public facilities containing single-gender washrooms [[Bathroom bill|to only allow people of the corresponding sex as listed on their birth certificate]] to use them; it also gave the state exclusive rights to determine the [[minimum wage]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/us/north-carolina-to-limit-bathroom-use-by-birth-gender.html|title=North Carolina Bans Local Anti-Discrimination Policies|last=Philipps|first=Dave|date=2016-03-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-02-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

HB2 was met with widespread protests: state, county and city governments across the United States [[Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act#Tourism and hospitality|forbade their employees from non-essential travel to North Carolina]]; numerous corporations and firms [[Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act#Economic impact|curbed plans to hold events and create jobs]] in the state, and many performers [[Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act#Economic impact#Music and performances|canceled performances in North Carolina]] to [[boycott]] the state; North Carolina's economy lost over $400 million in investments and jobs. The bill was also criticized by several religious organizations, and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] denounced it and called for its repeal. McCrory ultimately lost his bid for [[North Carolina gubernatorial election, 2016|re-election]] in 2016 to Democratic [[North Carolina Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Roy Cooper]], a vocal critic of the law, and the portion of the law regarding bathroom use was repealed on March 30, 2017.<ref name="nytimes-30mar2017">{{cite news|last1=Fausset|first1=Richard|title=Bathroom Law Repeal Leaves Few Pleased in North Carolina|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/north-carolina-senate-acts-to-repeal-restrictive-bathroom-law.html|accessdate=March 30, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 30, 2017}}</ref>

==Background and passage==
===Charlotte Ordinance 7056===
On February 22, 2016, the [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] [[City Council of Charlotte, North Carolina|City Council]] passed by a 7-4 vote the '''Ordinance&nbsp;7056''', a non-discrimination ordinance prohibiting discrimination on the basis of [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] in public accommodations or by passenger [[vehicles for hire]] or city contractors.<ref name="CMO2016">{{cite web|url=http://charmeck.org/city/charlotte/CityClerk/Ordinances/February%2022,%202016.pdf |title=City Clerk > City Clerk |publisher=Charmeck.org |accessdate=2017-03-31}}</ref><ref name="Council approves changes to Non-Discrimination Ordinance">{{cite web|url=http://charmeck.org/city/charlotte/Newsroom/Pages/Council-approves-changes-to-non-discrimination-ordinance.aspx|title=Council approves changes to non-discrimination ordinance|publisher=charmeck.org|accessdate=March 27, 2016}}</ref> The Council had debated a similar ordinance in 2015, which failed by a 6-5 vote because it did not include full protection of transgender people; the council first considered extending non-discrimination protection to LGBT people in 1992.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article11908907.html |title=Charlotte LGBT ordinance fails 6-5 in contentious meeting|newspaper=Charlotte Observer |accessdate=May 30, 2016}}</ref> The ordinance was to take effect on April 1, 2016.<ref name="CMO2016"/><ref name="Council approves changes to Non-Discrimination Ordinance"/>

McCrory and North Carolina lawmakers said the Department of Justice's intervention was orchestrated by the [[Executive Office of the President|Obama Administration]], but [[White House]] [[White House Press Secretary|Press Secretary]] [[Josh Earnest]] said, "These kinds of enforcement actions are made independent of any sort of political interference or direction from the White House.

{{quote|The recently adopted laws including in the states of Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee, which discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons in the United States contravene the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the US is a State party, and which states that the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection.

As a consequence, cultural, traditional or religious values cannot be invoked to justify any form of discrimination, including discrimination against LGBTI persons. These laws should be reconsidered as soon as possible.

The European Union reaffirms its commitment to the equality and dignity of all human beings irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity. We will continue to work to end all forms of discrimination and to counter attempts to embed or enhance discrimination wherever it occurs around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/statements-eeas/2016/160512_02_en.htm|title=European Union - EEAS (European External Action Service) - Statement by the Spokesperson on LGBTI rights in the United States}}</ref>}}

===Religious organizations===
On March 28, 2016, two religious organizations, the NC Values Coalition and the Keep NC Safe Coalition, released a list of forty-one businesses which the organizations said had signed a letter of support for House Bill 2. The organizations said their list included over 300 businesses but could only publicly name forty-one of them because others were afraid of retaliation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jarvis|first1=Craig|title=Major companies oppose LGBT law; supporters line up smaller firms|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/under-the-dome/article68814277.html}}</ref> The only national company listed, [[Hanesbrands]], was subsequently removed after it was learned a single employee had listed the company without permission.
