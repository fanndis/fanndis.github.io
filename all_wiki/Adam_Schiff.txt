===Press freedom===
Schiff formed the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Caucus for the Freedom of the Press in 2006<ref>{{cite web|title=The Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press Calls on Secretary of State Rice to Urge Russia to Protect Journalist Rights|url=http://schiff.house.gov/s2006/the-congressional-caucus-for-freedom-of-the-press-calls-on-secretary-of-state-rice-to-urge-russia-to-protect-journalist-rights/|website=Schiff Congressional Website|access-date=December 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207013721/https://schiff.house.gov/s2006/the-congressional-caucus-for-freedom-of-the-press-calls-on-secretary-of-state-rice-to-urge-russia-to-protect-journalist-rights/|archive-date=December 7, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> aimed at advancing press freedom around the world.

===Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen===
In 2015, Schiff supported the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]], saying: "The military action by Saudi Arabia and its partners was necessitated by the illegal action of the Houthi rebels and their Iranian backers. ... But ultimately, a negotiated end to this crisis is the only way to restore order in Yemen and shrink the space for terrorism".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/03/27/saudi-arabia-gets-bipartisan-backing-for-yemen-airstrikes |title=Saudi Arabia Gets Bipartisan Backing for Yemen Airstrikes |work=U.S. News. |date=March 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328004338/http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/03/27/saudi-arabia-gets-bipartisan-backing-for-yemen-airstrikes |archive-date=March 28, 2015|first=Julian|last=Pecquet}}</ref>

===War authorization reform and authorization against ISIS===
After then-president Obama's speech at the [[National Defense University]] examining the U.S. war powers during the [[War on Terror]], Schiff introduced bipartisan legislation to repeal the 2001 [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]], the legislation passed in the days after the [[September 11 attacks]] to combat [[al-Qaeda]], because he felt that "the current AUMF is outdated and straining at the edges to justify the use of force outside the war theater".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Spencer|title=Congressman Preps Bill to End Terror War Authority|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/05/schiff-aumf/|website=Wired|access-date=December 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111172509/http://www.wired.com/2013/05/schiff-aumf/|archive-date=November 11, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The bill, introduced with Rep.

===Comments on Trump–Russia collusion investigation===
{{Further|Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)}}

On March 22, 2017, in an interview with [[Chuck Todd]] on [[MSNBC]] Schiff claimed there was “more than circumstantial evidence now” that Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Russia. Todd followed up by asking if he had seen direct evidence of collusion and Schiff responded that there was "evidence that is not circumstantial and is very much worthy of investigation".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Conway |first1=Madeline |title=Schiff: There is now 'more than circumstantial evidence' of Trump-Russia collusion |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/schiff-russia-trump-collusion-236386 |access-date=April 2, 2019 |work=Politico |date=March 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402030222/https://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/schiff-russia-trump-collusion-236386 |archive-date=April 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On April 2, 2017, Schiff, the [[ranking member]] on the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Select Intelligence Committee]], which is tasked with conducting inquiries related to [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], appeared on [[CNN]]'s ''[[State of the Union (American TV program)|State of the Union]]''. In the wide-ranging interview, Schiff and host [[Jake Tapper]] discussed [[Michael Flynn]]'s request for immunity, Schiff's and [[Devin Nunes]]'s separate inspections of White House documents, Trump's allegations of wiretapping in Trump Tower, and Nunes's apparent close association with the Trump White House.<ref>{{cite news|title=Top Democrat accuses White House of trying to distract from Russia probe|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-russia-probe-20170402-story.html|author=Parker, Ashley|date=April 2, 2017|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=October 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006061956/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-russia-probe-20170402-story.html|archive-date=October 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Tapper asked Schiff if there was evidence of [[Donald Trump]]–[[Russia]] collusion.

Schiff replied, "It certainly is an attempt to distract and to hide the origin of the materials, to hide the White House hand. The question is, of course, why? And I think the answer to the question is this effort to point the Congress in other directions, basically say, don't look at me, don't look at Russia, there is nothing to see here".<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview With California Congressman Adam Schiff|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1704/02/sotu.01.html|publisher=CNN|date=April 2, 2017|access-date=October 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003004201/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1704/02/sotu.01.html|archive-date=October 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===North Korea===
Schiff called [[North Korea]] "one of the most brutal and despotic regimes in the world".

In April 2018, asked whether he thought Trump deserved at least partial credit for North Korea's involvement in talks with the US, Schiff responded: "I think it's more than fair to say that the combination of the president's unpredictability and indeed, his bellicosity had something to do with the North Koreans deciding to come to the [[2018 North Korea–United States summit|negotiating table]]".<ref>{{cite news |first=Harriet|last=Sinclair|title=Trump's 'Unpredictability' Helped North Korea Peace Talks, Adam Schiff Says |url=http://www.newsweek.com/trumps-unpredictability-helped-north-korea-table-adam-schiff-says-905342 |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=April 29, 2018 |access-date=June 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612135936/http://www.newsweek.com/trumps-unpredictability-helped-north-korea-table-adam-schiff-says-905342 |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Adam Schiff by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Schiff speaking to the [[California Democratic Party]] in June 2019.]]
In 2000, Schiff challenged Republican incumbent [[Jim Rogan]] in what was then the 27th district.

He became only the second Democrat to represent this district since its creation in 1913.

After the 2000 census, the district was renumbered as the 29th and made significantly more Democratic. As a result, Schiff has never faced another contest nearly as close as his 2000 bid, and has been reelected nine times. His district became even more Democratic after the 2010 census, when it was renumbered as the 28th and pushed into Los Angeles itself. Even before then, none of his Republican challengers had cleared 35 percent of the vote.

In 2010, Schiff defeated Tea Party–backed Republican John Colbert for a sixth term.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Schiff wins big in bid to return to Congress |url=http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_16512974 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313184506/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_16512974 |archive-date=March 13, 2012 }}</ref> In 2012, he defeated Republican Phil Jennerjahn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.glendalenewspress.com/2012-11-07/news/tn-gnp-1107-gatto-liu-schiff-handily-hold-on-to-their-seats_1_phil-jennerjahn-schiff-carol-liu |title=Gatto, Liu, Schiff handily hold on to their seats |first1=Jason |last1=Wells |first2=Mark |last2=Kellam |date=November 7, 2012 |work=[[Glendale News-Press]] |location=Glendale, California |access-date=February 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022604/http://articles.glendalenewspress.com/2012-11-07/news/tn-gnp-1107-gatto-liu-schiff-handily-hold-on-to-their-seats_1_phil-jennerjahn-schiff-carol-liu |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2014, he defeated independent candidate Steve Stokes.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kellam|first1=Mark|title=Schiff, Gatto easily win their political races|url=http://www.glendalenewspress.com/news/tn-gnp-me-schiff-gatto-have-easy-wins-in-their-political-races-20141105,0,1749310.story|access-date=November 21, 2014|work=[[Glendale News-Press]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120185508/http://www.glendalenewspress.com/news/tn-gnp-me-schiff-gatto-have-easy-wins-in-their-political-races-20141105,0,1749310.story|archive-date=November 20, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2016, he defeated Republican candidate Lenore Solis.
