In 1960, Simões-Ferreira earned a Bachelor of Arts in [[Romance languages|Romance Languages]] and Literature from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. In 1963, she graduated from the School of Translation and Interpretation at the [[University of Geneva]] and moved to the United States to be an [[interpreter]] at the [[United Nations]].

==Marriages, children, and personal life==
On February 5, 1966, at [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's]] gothic [[Heinz Chapel]] on the campus of the [[University of Pittsburgh]], Simões-Ferreira married future U.S. Senator [[John Heinz]], an heir to the [[H. J. Heinz Company]]. In 1971, Teresa Heinz became a [[naturalized United States citizen]]. The couple had three sons:
*Henry John Heinz IV (born November 4, 1966)
*[[André Heinz|André Thierstein Heinz]] (born December 9, 1969)
*[[Christopher Drake Heinz]] (born March 20, 1973)
[[File:Secretary Kerry and his Wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, Enjoy Their Grandson.jpg|thumb|right|Teresa Heinz Kerry and Secretary Kerry with her grandson]]
In 1990, Teresa Heinz met Senator Kerry at an [[Earth Day]] rally. This was the only reported time the two met before Senator Heinz died in a plane crash on April 4, 1991. In 1992, Teresa Heinz met Kerry again, this time at the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Heinz was a member of a [[United States Department of State|State Department]] delegation appointed by then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]]. The two began courting in 1993 and were married May 26, 1995, in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]]. Choosing to remain registered as a Republican until [[John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004|John Kerry's presidential bid in 2004]], Heinz retained the name Teresa Heinz. In May 2004, she said: <blockquote>
My legal name is still Teresa Heinz. Teresa Heinz Kerry is my name... for politics. Just so people don't ask me questions about so and so is so and so's wife or this and that. Teresa Heinz is what I've been all my growing-up life, adult life, more than any other name. And it's the name of my boys, you know ?... So, that's my legal name and that's my office name, my Pittsburgh name.<ref name="Lawrence"/>
</blockquote>
In addition to Portuguese (her native language),<ref>http://old.post-gazette.com/nation/20020605teresanat1p1.asp</ref> Heinz speaks English, Spanish, French, and Italian.<ref>http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/on_the_trail/2004/09/the_foreign_wives_club.html</ref> She is [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].<ref name="Thurman" />

===Women's economic security programs and advocacy===
In 1995, the book ''Pensions in Crisis: Why the system is failing America and how you can protect your future'' (later republished as ''The Pension Book'') was published, with support from the Teresa and H. John Heinz III Foundation, and a foreword by Heinz.<ref name="hfp_retirement">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hfp.heinz.org/programs/womensretirement.html|title=Heinz Family Philanthropies - Women's Retirement Initiative|date=2003-12-19|access-date=2017-11-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031219200600/http://www.hfp.heinz.org/programs/womensretirement.html|archivedate=December 19, 2003|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblio.com/books/37833981.html|title=Pensions in Crisis: Why the system is failing America and how you can protect your future - Karen and Blackwell, Kate Ferguson|date=2007-09-26|access-date=2017-11-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222803/http://www.biblio.com/books/37833981.html|archivedate=September 26, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Spurred by the issues uncovered by ''Pensions in Crisis'', Heinz and her foundation created the Women's Retirement Initiative to "extend that investigation and examine how the dynamics of our pension and retirement system contribute to the disproportionate rate of poverty among older women."<ref name="hfp_retirement" />

In 1996, the Heinz Foundations created WISER, the Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heinzfamily.org/issues/womensecosec_02.html |title=Heinz Family Philanthropies – WISER |publisher=Heinzfamily.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>

==Wealth==
Heinz and Kerry signed a prenuptial agreement and have kept their premarital assets separate{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}.
Heinz has declined to disclose her personal tax returns, citing family trusts and privacy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} She is estimated to be worth between $750 million and $1.2 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jun/27/nation/na-heinz27|title=Estimate of Heinz Fortune Doubled|last=Vartabedian|first=Ralph|date=2004-06-27|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> According to her most recently released income tax of 2003, Kerry and Heinz paid an effective federal income tax rate of 12%{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}.

==Politics==
Like her first husband, Heinz was a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for most of her voting life, and she remained a registered Republican despite being married to Kerry. In January 2003, she changed her registration to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

In 2003, Heinz was named to the [[PoliticsPA]] list of "Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women".<ref>{{cite web| title =Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women| work = [[PoliticsPA]]| publisher = The Publius Group| year = 2001| url = http://www.politicspa.com/features/mostpoliticallypowerfulwomen.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040209095936/http://politicspa.com/features/mostpoliticallypowerfulwomen.htm|archivedate=February 9, 2004}}</ref>

Heinz is said to have been encouraged to run for her first husband's vacant Senate seat after his death. Heinz declined and refused to endorse Republican Congressman [[Rick Santorum]]'s [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 1994|1994 bid]] for the seat. She publicly denounced him as the "antithesis" of her late husband, and later called him "[[Forrest Gump (character)|Forrest Gump]] with attitude." It was rumored she would challenge Santorum in [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2006|2006]] (as a Democrat), but she did not enter the race, and the Democratic nomination went to [[Treasurer of Pennsylvania|State Treasurer]] [[Bob Casey, Jr.]], who went on to defeat Santorum.

Heinz has a reputation in the media as a very direct personality.<ref>{{cite news | title = The Making of a Non-President | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49993-2004Nov14.html | author = Kurtz, Howard |work=Washington Post | page = C01 | date = November 15, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 | authorlink = Howard Kurtz }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6407226/site/newsweek | title = How Bush Did It |work=Newsweek | date = November 15, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 | url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060619172718/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6407226/site/newsweek |archivedate = June 19, 2006}}</ref> In an interview published in ''[[USA Today]]'' in July 2004, Heinz was asked about the differences between then-First Lady [[Laura Bush]] and herself:
<blockquote>
"Well, you know, I don't know Laura Bush. But she seems to be calm, and she has a sparkle in her eye, which is good. But I don't know that she's ever had a real job—I mean, since she's been grown up. So her experience and her validation comes from important things, but different things. And I’m older, and my validation of what I do and what I believe and my experience is a little bit bigger–because I’m older, and I’ve had different experiences. And it’s not a criticism of her. It’s just, you know, what life is about.
"<ref>{{cite news | title = The real running mates |work=USA Today | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/2004-10-19-teresa_x.htm | date = October 20, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 }}</ref>
</blockquote>
Heinz retracted the statement later, saying she was "sincerely sorry" for the remark. "I had forgotten that Mrs. Bush had worked as a schoolteacher and librarian, and there couldn't be a more important job than teaching our children", Heinz said. "As someone who has been both a full time mom and full time in the workforce, I know we all have valuable experiences that shape who we are. I appreciate and honor Mrs. Bush's service to the country as first lady, and am sincerely sorry I had not remembered her important work in the past."<ref name = Apology>{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/20/theresa.apologizes.laura | title = Heinz Kerry apologizes for remark | publisher = CNN | date = October 21, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 }}</ref>

Bush brushed it off, saying, "It didn't matter to me. It didn't hurt my feelings. It was perfectly all right that she apologized. She didn't have to apologize. I know how tough it is. And actually I know those trick questions."<ref>{{cite news | publisher = CNN | url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/21/laura.teresa/ | title = Laura Bush brushes aside Heinz Kerry's remarks | date = October 21, 2004 | accessdate = July 29, 2006 }}</ref>
