'''Southeast Asia''' or ''' Southeastern Asia''' is the [[Subregion#Asia|southeastern subregion]] of [[Asia]], consisting of the regions that are geographically south of [[China]], east of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and north-west of [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map_of_southeast_asia.htm | title = Map of Southeast Asia Region | author = Klaus Kästle | date = 10 September 2013 | website = Nations Online Project | publisher = One World – Nations Online | accessdate = 10 September 2013
| quote = Southeast Asia is a vast subregion of Asia, roughly described as geographically situated east of the Indian subcontinent, south of China, and northwest of Australia. The region is located between the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal in the west, the Philippine Sea, the South China Sea, and the Pacific Ocean in the east.}}</ref> Southeast Asia is bordered to the north by [[East Asia]], to the west by [[South Asia]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]], to the east by [[Oceania]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]], and to the south by [[Australia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. The region is the only part of Asia that lies partly within the [[Southern Hemisphere]], although the majority of it is in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. In contemporary definition, Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions:

# [[Mainland Southeast Asia]], also known as the [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochinese Peninsula]] and historically as [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochina]], comprising [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]], [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]].
# [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], also known as the [[Malay Archipelago]] and historically as ''[[Nusantara]]'', comprising the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] ([[India]]), [[Brunei]], [[East Malaysia]], [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]] (except [[Western New Guinea]], which is considered a part of [[Oceania]]), the [[Philippines]], and [[Singapore]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NuW3BgAAQBAJ&q=Taiwan+%22Maritime+Southeast+Asia%22&pg=PA7|title=Maritime Southeast Asia to 500|last=Shaffer|first=Lynda Norene|date=2015-02-18|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317465201|language=en}}</ref>

The region lies near the intersection of [[plate tectonics|geological plates]], with both heavy seismic and volcanic activities. The [[Sunda Plate]] is the main plate of the region, featuring almost all Southeast Asian countries except Myanmar, northern Thailand, northern Laos, northern Vietnam, and northern [[Luzon]] of the Philippines. The mountain ranges in Myanmar, Thailand, and peninsular Malaysia are part of the [[Alpide belt]], while the islands of the Philippines are part of the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]]. Both seismic belts meet in Indonesia, causing the region to have relatively high occurrences of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chester|first1=Roy|title=Furnace of Creation, Cradle of Destruction: A Journey to the Birthplace of Earthquakes, Volcanoes, and Tsunamis|publisher=AMACOM|isbn=978-0814409206|date=2008-07-16|url=https://archive.org/details/furnaceofcreatio00ches}}</ref>

Southeast Asia covers about 4.5 million km<sup>2</sup> (1.7 million mi<sup>2</sup>), which is 10.5% of Asia or 3% of earth's total land area. Its total population is more than {{#expr:floor({{replace|{{UN_Population|South-Eastern Asia}}|,||}}/1e6)}} million, about 8.5% of the world's population. It is the third most populous geographical region in Asia after South Asia and East Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/asia-population/|title=Population of Asia (2018) - Worldometers|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref> The region is culturally and ethnically diverse, with hundreds of languages spoken by different ethnic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zide; Baker|first1=Norman H.; Milton E.|title=Studies in comparative Austroasiatic linguistics|date=1966|publisher=Foreign Language Study}}</ref> Ten countries in the region are members of the [[ASEAN|Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), a [[regional organization]] established for economic, political, military, educational and cultural integration amongst its members.<ref>{{cite web|title=ASEAN Member States|url=http://asean.org/asean/asean-member-states/|website=ASEAN}}</ref>

==Definitions==
The region, together with part of South Asia, was well known by Europeans as the [[East Indies]] or simply the Indies until the 20th century. Chinese sources referred the region as "{{linktext|lang=zh|南洋}}" (''[[Nanyang (region)|Nanyang]]''), which literally means the "Southern Ocean." The mainland section of Southeast Asia was referred to as [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochina]] by European geographers due to its location between China and the Indian subcontinent and its having cultural influences from both neighboring regions. In the 20th century, however, the term became more restricted to territories of the former [[French Indochina]] (Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam). The maritime section of Southeast Asia is also known as the [[Malay Archipelago]], a term derived from the European concept of a [[Malay race]].<ref name=Wallace>{{Cite book | last = Wallace | first = Alfred Russel | authorlink = Alfred Russel Wallace | title = The Malay Archipelago | publisher = Macmillan and Co | year = 1869 | location = London | page = 1 }}</ref> Another term for Maritime Southeast Asia is ''[[Malay Archipelago#Insulindia|Insulindia]]'' (Indian Islands), used to describe the region between Indochina and [[Australasia]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lach; Van Kley|first1=Donald F.; Edwin J|title=Asia in the Making of Europe, Volume III|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226467689}}</ref>

The term "Southeast Asia" was first used in 1839 by American pastor Howard Malcolm in his book ''Travels in South-Eastern Asia''. Malcolm only included the Mainland section and excluded the Maritime section in his definition of Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite book | date=1996 | first1=Joshua | last1=Eliot | title=Indonesia, Malaysia & Singapore Handbook | publisher=Trade & Trade & Travel Publications | location=New York City | first2=Jane | first3=Sebastian | last2=Bickersteth | last3=Ballard}}</ref> The term was officially used in the midst of [[World War II]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], through the formation of [[South East Asia Command]] (SEAC) in 1943.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Park; King|first1=Seung-Woo; Victor T.|title=The Historical Construction of Southeast Asian Studies: Korea and Beyond|date=2013|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|location=Singapore|isbn=9789814414586}}</ref> SEAC popularised the use of the term "Southeast Asia," although what constituted Southeast Asia was not fixed; for example, SEAC excluded the [[Philippines]] and a large part of [[Indonesia]] while including [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. However, by the late 1970s, a roughly standard usage of the term "Southeast Asia" and the territories it encompasses had emerged.<ref name="emmerson"/> Although from a cultural or linguistic perspective the definitions of "Southeast Asia" may vary, the most common definitions nowadays include the area represented by the countries (sovereign states and dependent territories) listed below.

Ten of the eleven states of Southeast Asia are members of the [[ASEAN|Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), while [[East Timor]] is an observer state. [[Papua New Guinea]] has stated that it might join ASEAN, and is currently an observer. Sovereignty issues exist over some [[South China Sea Islands|islands in the South China Sea]].

Southeast Asia is geographically divided into two subregions, namely [[Mainland Southeast Asia]] (or the [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochinese Peninsula]]) and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] (or the similarly defined [[Malay Archipelago]]) ({{lang-jv|Nusantara}}).

[[Mainland Southeast Asia]] includes:

{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}
* [[Cambodia]]
* [[Laos]]
* [[Myanmar|Myanmar (Burma)]]
* [[Peninsular Malaysia]]
* [[Thailand]]
* [[Vietnam]]

[[Maritime Southeast Asia]] includes:
{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}
* [[Brunei]]
* [[East Malaysia]]
* [[East Timor]]
* [[Indonesia]]
* [[Philippines]]
* [[Singapore]]
{{Div col end}}

Geographically, the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] of India is also considered a part of Maritime Southeast Asia. Eastern [[Bangladesh]] and [[Northeast India]] have strong cultural ties with Mainland Southeast Asia and are sometimes considered transregional areas between South Asia and Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baruah|first1=Sanjib|title=Durable Disorder: Understanding the Politics of Northeast India|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> [[Sri Lanka]] has on some occasions been considered a part of Southeast Asia because of its cultural ties to mainland Southeast Asia.<ref name="emmerson">{{cite journal |last1=Emmerson |first1=Donald K |date=1984 |title=Southeast Asia: What's in a Name? |journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–21 |doi=10.1017/S0022463400012182|jstor=20070562 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1= Friborg|first1=Bastian|title=Southeast Asia: Myth or Reality pg 4|date=2010|publisher=}}</ref> The eastern half of the island of [[New Guinea]] which is not a part of Indonesia, namely, [[Papua New Guinea]], is sometimes included as a part of Maritime Southeast Asia, and so are [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], and [[Palau]], which were all parts of the [[Spanish East Indies]] with strong cultural and linguistic ties to the region, specifically, the Philippines.<ref>{{cite book|author=Inoue, Yukiko|title=Teaching with Educational Technology in the 21st Century: The Case of the Asia-Pacific Region: The Case of the Asia-Pacific Region|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nU-9AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5|year=2005|publisher=Idea Group Inc (IGI)|isbn=978-1-59140-725-6|page=5}}</ref>

East Timor and the eastern half of Indonesia (east of the [[Wallace Line]] in the region of [[Wallacea]]) are considered to be biogeographically associated with Oceania due to their distinctive faunal features. Geologically, the island of [[New Guinea]] and its surrounding islands are considered as parts of the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]], connected via the [[Sahul Shelf]].

Studies presented by [[Human Genome Organization|HUGO (Human Genome Organization)]] through genetic studies of the various peoples of Asia, show empirically that there was a single migration event from Africa, whereby the early people travelled along the south coast of Asia, first entered the Malay peninsula 50,000–90,000 years ago. The Orang Asli, in particular the [[Semang]] who show Negrito characteristics, are the direct descendants of these earliest settlers of Southeast Asia. These early people diversified and travelled slowly northwards to China, and the populations of Southeast Asia show greater genetic diversity than the younger population of China.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8406506.stm |work=BBC News | title=Genetic 'map' of Asia's diversity | date=11 December 2009}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/187435|title=Geneticist clarifies role of Proto-Malays in human origin|date=2012-01-25|work=Malaysiakini|access-date=2017-08-27|language=English}}</ref>

By the 5th century CE, trade networking between East and West was concentrated in the maritime route. Foreign traders were starting to use new routes such as [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca]] and [[Sunda Strait]] due to the development of maritime Southeast Asia. This change resulted in the decline of Funan, while new maritime powers such as [[Srivijaya]], [[Tarumanagara]], and [[Medang Kingdom|Medang]] emerged.

In the 11th century, a turbulent period occurred in the history of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. The [[India]]n [[Chola]] navy crossed the ocean and attacked the [[Srivijaya]] kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman in Kadaram ([[Kedah Kingdom|Kedah]]); the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom was sacked and the king was taken captive. Along with Kadaram, Pannai in present-day [[Sumatra]] and Malaiyur and the Malayan peninsula were attacked too. Soon after that, the king of Kedah Phra Ong Mahawangsa became the first ruler to abandon the traditional [[Hindu]] faith, and converted to Islam with the [[Sultanate of Kedah]] established in 1136. [[Samudera Pasai]] converted to Islam in 1267, the King of Malacca [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]] married the princess of Pasai, and the son became the first sultan of Malacca. Soon, Malacca became the center of Islamic study and maritime trade, and other rulers followed suit. [[Indonesia]]n religious leader and Islamic scholar [[Hamka]] (1908–1981) wrote in 1961: "The development of Islam in Indonesia and [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] is intimately related to a Chinese Muslim, Admiral [[Zheng He]]."<ref>{{cite book|last=Wang Ma|first=Rosey|title=Chinese Muslims in Malaysia: History and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jK8ltwAACAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Center for Asia-Pacific Area Studies, Academia Sinica}}</ref>

There are several theories to the [[Islamisation]] process in Southeast Asia. Another theory is trade. The expansion of trade among West Asia, India and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from Southern Yemen (Hadramout) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade. Many settled in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. This is evident in the Arab-Indonesian, Arab-Singaporean, and Arab-Malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. Finally, the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region. The ruler of the region's most important port, [[Malacca Sultanate]], embraced Islam in the 15th century, heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as Islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes. [[Gujarati Muslims]] played a pivotal role in establishing [[Islam]] in Southeast Asia.<ref name=toi>{{cite news|title=Gujarat helped establish Islam in SE Asia|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ampnbspGujarat-helped-establish-Islam-in-SE-Asia/articleshow/11262585.cms|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|last=Prabhune|first=Tushar|location=[[Ahmedabad]]|date=27 December 2011}}</ref>

Malaysian legend has it that a Chinese Ming emperor sent a princess, [[Hang Li Po]], to Malacca, with a retinue of 500, to marry [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|Sultan Mansur Shah]] after the emperor was impressed by the wisdom of the sultan. Han Li Po's well (constructed 1459) is now a tourist attraction there, as is [[Bukit Cina]], where her retinue settled.

The strategic value of the [[Strait of Malacca]], which was controlled by [[Sultanate of Malacca]] in the 15th and early 16th century, did not go unnoticed by [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] writer [[Duarte Barbosa]], who in 1500 wrote "He who is lord of Malacca has his hand on the throat of [[Venice]]".

[[Chronology of European exploration of Asia|European explorers]] were reaching Southeast Asia from the west and from the east.

Before the eighteenth and nineteenth century, the Europeans mostly were interested in expanding trade links. For the majority of the populations in each country, there was comparatively little interaction with Europeans and traditional social routines and relationships continued.

===Climate===
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map Southeastern Asia present.svg|thumb|Southeast Asia map of Köppen climate classification.]]

The climate in Southeast Asia is mainly tropical–hot and humid all year round with plentiful rainfall. Northern Vietnam and the mountainous parts of Laos and Myanmar are the only regions in Southeast Asia that feature a [[subtropical climate]], which have a cold winter with snow. The majority of Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shift in winds or [[monsoon]]. The [[tropical rain belt]] causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season. The rain forest is the second largest on earth (with the Amazon being the largest). An exception to this type of climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern region, where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures and drier landscape. Other parts fall out of this climate because they are desert-like.

Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change in the world.<ref name=":2">Overland, Indra et al.

[[File:Komodo dragon at Komodo National Park.jpg|thumb|Komodo dragon in [[Komodo National Park]], [[Indonesia]]]]

The vast majority of Southeast Asia falls within the warm, humid tropics, and its climate generally can be characterised as monsoonal.
The animals of Southeast Asia are diverse; on the islands of [[Borneo]] and [[Sumatra]], the [[orangutan]], the [[Asian elephant]], the [[Malayan tapir]], the [[Sumatran rhinoceros]] and the [[Bornean clouded leopard]] can also be found. Six subspecies of the [[binturong]] or ''bearcat'' exist in the region, though the one endemic to the island of [[Palawan]] is now classed as vulnerable.

Tigers of three different subspecies are found on the island of Sumatra (the [[Sumatran tiger]]), in peninsular Malaysia (the [[Malayan tiger]]), and in Indochina (the [[Indochinese tiger]]); all of which are endangered species.

The [[Komodo dragon]] is the largest living species of lizard and inhabits the islands of [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]], [[Rinca]], [[Flores]], and [[Gili Motang]] in Indonesia.

[[File:Pithecophaga jefferyi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Philippine eagle]]]]

The [[Philippine eagle]] is the [[national bird]] of the Philippines. It is considered by scientists as the largest eagle in the world,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.haribon.org.ph/index.php?view=article&id=223:the-largest-eagle-in-the-world&option=com_content&Itemid=119 | date=13 December 2012 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all | title=Climate Reality Watch Party 2016}}</ref> and is endemic to the Philippines' forests.

The [[wild Asian water buffalo]], and on various islands related dwarf species of ''[[Bubalus]]'' such as [[anoa]] were once widespread in Southeast Asia; nowadays the [[domestic Asian water buffalo]] is common across the region, but its remaining relatives are rare and endangered.

The [[mouse deer]], a small tusked deer as large as a toy dog or cat, mostly can be found on Sumatra, Borneo (Indonesia) and in Palawan Islands (Philippines). The [[gaur]], a gigantic wild ox larger than even wild water buffalo, is found mainly in Indochina. There is very little scientific information available regarding Southeast Asian amphibians.<ref>{{Cite book|page=68|title=Southeast Asian Biodiversity in Crisis|author=Navjot S. Sodhi|author2=Barry W. Brook|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-521-83930-3}}</ref>

Birds such as the [[green peafowl]] and [[drongo]] live in this subregion as far east as Indonesia. The [[babirusa]], a four-tusked pig, can be found in Indonesia as well. The [[hornbill]] was prized for its beak and used in trade with China. The horn of the rhinoceros, not part of its skull, was prized in China as well.

The [[Malay Archipelago|Indonesian Archipelago]] is split by the [[Wallace Line]]. This line runs along what is now known to be a tectonic plate boundary, and separates Asian (Western) species from Australasian (Eastern) species. The islands between Java/Borneo and Papua form a mixed zone, where both types occur, known as Wallacea. As the pace of development accelerates and populations continue to expand in Southeast Asia, concern has increased regarding the impact of human activity on the region's environment. A significant portion of Southeast Asia, however, has not changed greatly and remains an unaltered home to wildlife. The nations of the region, with only few exceptions, have become aware of the need to maintain forest cover not only to prevent [[soil erosion]] but to preserve the diversity of flora and fauna. Indonesia, for example, has created an extensive system of national parks and preserves for this purpose. Even so, such species as the [[Javan rhinoceros]] face extinction, with only a handful of the animals remaining in western Java.

[[File:Wallace's line.jpg|thumb|right|Wallace's hypothetical line divide Indonesian Archipelago into 2 types of fauna, Australasian and Southeast Asian fauna. The deep water of the [[Lombok Strait]] between the islands of [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]] formed a water barrier even when lower sea levels linked the now-separated islands and landmasses on either side.]]
The shallow waters of the [[Southeast Asian coral reefs]] have the highest levels of [[biodiversity]] for the world's marine ecosystems, where coral, fish and molluscs abound. According to Conservation International, marine surveys suggest that the marine life diversity in the [[Raja Ampat]] (Indonesia) is the highest recorded on Earth. Diversity is considerably greater than any other area sampled in the Coral Triangle composed of Indonesia, Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. The Coral Triangle is the heart of the world's coral reef biodiversity, the Verde Passage is dubbed by Conservation International as the world's "center of the center of marine shorefish biodiversity". The [[whale shark]], the world's largest species of fish and 6 species of [[sea turtle]]s can also be found in the [[South China Sea]] and the Pacific Ocean territories of the Philippines.

The trees and other plants of the region are tropical; in some countries where the mountains are tall enough, temperate-climate vegetation can be found. These rainforest areas are currently being logged-over, especially in Borneo.

While Southeast Asia is rich in flora and fauna, [[Deforestation in Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia is facing severe deforestation]] which causes habitat loss for various [[endangered species]] such as orangutan and the [[Sumatran tiger]]. Predictions have been made that more than 40% of the animal and [[Flora|plant species]] in Southeast Asia could be wiped out in the 21st century.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/endangered-species/dn3973 Biodiversity wipeout facing Southeast Asia], New Scientist, 23 July 2003</ref> At the same time, [[haze]] has been a regular occurrence. The two worst regional hazes were in [[1997 Southeast Asian haze|1997]] and [[2006 Southeast Asian haze|2006]] in which multiple countries were covered with thick haze, mostly caused by "[[slash and burn]]" activities in Sumatra and Borneo. In reaction, several countries in Southeast Asia signed the [[ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution]] to combat haze pollution.

The [[2013 Southeast Asian haze|2013 Southeast Asian Haze]] saw API levels reach a hazardous level in some countries. Muar experienced the highest [[Air pollution index|API]] level of 746 on 23 June 2013 at around 7 am.<ref>[[2013 Southeast Asian haze#Air Pollution Index readings]]</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:The port of Singapore.jpg|thumb|The [[Port of Singapore]] is the busiest [[List of world's busiest transshipment ports|transshipment]] and [[List of busiest container ports|container port]] in the world, and is an important transportation and shipping hub in Southeast Asia.]]

Even prior to the penetration of European interests, Southeast Asia was a critical part of the world trading system. A wide range of commodities originated in the region, but especially important were spices such as pepper, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. The spice trade initially was developed by [[India]]n and [[Arab]] merchants, but it also brought Europeans to the region. First [[Spain|Spaniards]] ([[Manila galleon]]) who sailed from the Americas and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]], then the Dutch, and finally the British and French became involved in this enterprise in various countries. The penetration of European commercial interests gradually evolved into annexation of territories, as traders lobbied for an extension of control to protect and expand their activities. As a result, the Dutch moved into [[Indonesia]], the British into [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] and parts of Borneo, the French into [[Indochina]], and the Spanish and the US into the [[Philippines]]. An economic effect of this imperialism was the shift in the production of commodities. For example, the rubber plantations of Malaysia, Java, Vietnam and Cambodia, the tin mining of Malaya, the rice fields of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and Irrawaddy River delta in Burma, were a response to powerful market demands.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The [[overseas Chinese]] community has played a large role in the development of the economies in the region.

Tourism has been a key factor in economic development for many Southeast Asian countries, especially Cambodia. According to UNESCO, "tourism, if correctly conceived, can be a tremendous development tool and an effective means of preserving the cultural diversity of our planet."<ref>[http://pub.unwto.org:81/WebRoot/Store/Shops/Infoshop/Products/1240/1240-1.pdf Background overview of The National Seminar on Sustainable Tourism Resource Management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324004538/http://pub.unwto.org:81/WebRoot/Store/Shops/Infoshop/Products/1240/1240-1.pdf |date=24 March 2012 }}, Phnom Penh, 9–10 June 2003.</ref> Since the early 1990s, "even the non-ASEAN nations such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Burma, where the income derived from tourism is low, are attempting to expand their own tourism industries."<ref>Hitchcock, Michael, et al.

[[File:Southeast Asia population distribution.png|thumb|Population distribution of the countries of Southeast Asia (with Indonesia split into its major islands).]]

Southeast Asia has an area of approximately {{convert|4500000|km2|mi2}}. As of {{UN_Population|Year}}, around {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|South-Eastern Asia}}|,||}}/1e6 round 0}} million people live in the region, more than a fifth live (143&nbsp;million) on the Indonesian island of [[Java]], the most densely populated large island in the world. [[Indonesia]] is the most populous country with {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Indonesia}}|,||}}/1e6 round 0}} million people, and also the 4th most populous country in the world. The distribution of the religions and people is diverse in Southeast Asia and varies by country. Some 30&nbsp;million [[overseas Chinese]] also live in Southeast Asia, most prominently in [[Christmas Island]], Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, and also as the [[Hoa people|Hoa]] in Vietnam. People of Southeast Asian origins are known as Southeast Asians or Aseanites.

===Ethnic groups===
{{Main|Ethnic groups of Southeast Asia}}
[[File:Ati woman.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ati (tribe)|Ati]] woman in [[Aklan]]{{spaced ndash}}the [[Negrito]]s were the earliest inhabitants of Southeast Asia.]]

The [[Orang Asli|Aslians]] and [[Negrito]]s were believed as one of the earliest inhabitant in the region. They are genetically related to the [[Papuan people|Papuans]] in Eastern Indonesia, East Timor and [[Australian Aborigines]]. In modern times, the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] are the largest ethnic group in Southeast Asia, with more than 100 million people, mostly concentrated in [[Java]], Indonesia. The second largest ethnic group in Southeast Asia is [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] (Kinh people) with around 86 million population, mainly inhabiting in Vietnam, thus forming a significant minority in neighboring Cambodia and Laos. The [[Thai people|Thais]] is also a significant ethnic group with around 59 million population forming the majority in Thailand. In Burma, the [[Bamar|Burmese]] account for more than two-thirds of the ethnic stock in this country, with the Indo-Aryan [[Rohingya]] make up a significant minority in [[Rakhine State]].
 
[[File:Bali – The People (2685069056).jpg|thumb|A [[Native Indonesian]] [[Balinese people|Balinese]] girl wearing [[kebaya]] during a traditional ceremony.]]
Indonesia is clearly dominated by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] ethnic groups, with hundreds of ethnic minorities inhabited the archipelago, including [[Madurese people|Madurese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Bugis]], [[Balinese people|Balinese]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] and [[Malay Indonesian|Malays]]. While Malaysia is split between more than half [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] and one-quarter Chinese, and also Indian minority in the [[West Malaysia]] however [[Dayaks]] make up the majority in [[Sarawak]] and [[Kadazan-dusun]] makes up the majority in [[Sabah]] which are in the [[East Malaysia]]. The [[Ethnic Malay|Malays]] are the majority in West Malaysia and Brunei, while they forming a significant minority in [[Indonesia]], [[Thai Malay|Southern Thailand]], [[East Malaysia]] and [[Malay Singaporean|Singapore]]. In city-state Singapore, [[Chinese Singaporean|Chinese]] are the majority, yet the city is a multicultural melting pot with Malays, Indians and Eurasian also called the island their home.

The [[Chams]] form a significant minority in Central and South Vietnam, also in Central Cambodia. While the [[Khmer people|Khmers]] are the majority in Cambodia, and form a significant minority in [[Khmer Krom|Southern Vietnam]] and Thailand, the [[Hmong people]] are the minority in Vietnam, China and Laos.

Within the Philippines, the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Visayan people|Visayan]] (mainly [[Cebuano people|Cebuanos]], [[Waray people|Warays]] and [[Hiligaynon people|Hiligaynons]]), [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], [[Bicolano people|Bicolano]], [[Moro people|Moro]] (mainly [[Tausug people|Tausug]], [[Maranao people|Maranao]], and [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]]) and Central Luzon (mainly [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] and [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinan]]) groups are significant.

Countries in Southeast Asia practice many different religions. By population, [[Islam]] is the most practised faith, numbering approximately 240 million adherents, or about 40% of the entire population, concentrated in [[Indonesia]], [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]], [[Southern Thailand]] and in the [[Southern Philippines]]. Indonesia is the most populous Muslim-majority country around the world.

There are approximately 205 million Buddhists in Southeast Asia, making it the second largest religion in the region, after Islam. Approximately 38% of the global Buddhist population resides in Southeast Asia. [[Buddhism]] is predominant in Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Burma and Singapore. Ancestor worship and [[Confucianism]] are also widely practised in Vietnam and Singapore.

[[Christianity]] is predominant in the Philippines, eastern Indonesia, East Malaysia and East Timor. The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia. East Timor is also predominantly Roman Catholic due to a history of Portuguese rule.

No individual Southeast Asian country is religiously homogeneous. Some groups are protected ''de facto'' by their isolation from the rest of the world.<ref name=indigenous >[https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/21/asia/andaman-nicobar-us-missionary-killed-intl/index.html CNN (11/21/2018) Tribespeople believed to have 'killed' 27-year-old missionary who trespassed on remote island]</ref> In the world's most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia, Hinduism is dominant on islands such as [[Bali]]. Christianity also predominates in the rest of the part of the Philippines, [[New Guinea]] and [[Timor]]. Pockets of Hindu population can also be found around Southeast Asia in Singapore, Malaysia etc. [[Garuda]] (Sanskrit: Garuḍa), the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] who is the mount (vahanam) of [[Vishnu]], is a national symbol in both Thailand and Indonesia; in the Philippines, gold images of Garuda have been found on [[Palawan]]; gold images of other Hindu gods and goddesses have also been found on [[Mindanao]]. Balinese Hinduism is somewhat different from Hinduism practised elsewhere, as Animism and local culture is incorporated into it. Christians can also be found throughout Southeast Asia; they are in the majority in East Timor and the Philippines, Asia's largest Christian nation. In addition, there are also older tribal religious practices in remote areas of [[Sarawak]] in East Malaysia, Highland Philippines and Papua in eastern Indonesia. In Burma, Sakka ([[Indra]]) is revered as a ''[[nat (spirit)|nat]]''. In Vietnam, Mahayana Buddhism is practised, which is influenced by native animism but with strong emphasis on [[ancestor worship]].

==Culture==
{{See also|Southeast Asian cinema|Southeast Asian Games|Southeast Asian music}}
[[File:Burmese puppetry.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Burmese puppet performance]]

The culture in Southeast Asia is very diverse: on mainland Southeast Asia, the culture is a mix of Burmese, Cambodian, Laotian and Thai ([[Greater India|Indian]]) and Vietnamese ([[East Asian cultural sphere|Chinese]]) cultures. While in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia the culture is a mix of indigenous [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]], Indian, Islamic, Western, and Chinese cultures. Also Brunei shows a strong influence from Arabia. Vietnam and Singapore show more Chinese influence<ref>http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001478/147804eb.pdf</ref> in that Singapore, although being geographically a Southeast Asian nation, is home to a large Chinese majority and Vietnam was in [[East Asian cultural sphere|China's sphere of influence]] for much of its history. Indian influence in Singapore is only evident through the Tamil migrants,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsite.nl.sg/PDFs/BiblioAsia/BIBA_0303Oct07a.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021102125/http://www.microsite.nl.sg/PDFs/BiblioAsia/BIBA_0303Oct07a.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which influenced, to some extent, the [[cuisine of Singapore]]. Throughout Vietnam's history, it has had no direct influence from India – only through contact with the Thai, Khmer and Cham peoples. Moreover, Vietnam is also categorized under the [[East Asian cultural sphere]] along with China, Korea, and Japan due to the large amount of Chinese influence embedded in their culture and lifestyle.
[[File:Paddy field, Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|A [[paddy field]] in Vietnam.]]
[[Rice paddy]] agriculture has existed in Southeast Asia for millennia, ranging across the subregion. Some dramatic examples of these rice paddies populate the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] in the mountains of Luzon in the [[Philippines]]. Maintenance of these paddies is very labour-intensive. The rice paddies are well-suited to the monsoon climate of the region.

[[Stilt house]]s can be found all over Southeast Asia, from Thailand and Vietnam, to Borneo, to Luzon in the Philippines, to [[Papua New Guinea stilt house|Papua New Guinea]]. The region has diverse metalworking, especially in Indonesia. This include weaponry, such as the distinctive [[kris]], and musical instruments, such as the [[gamelan]].

===Influences===
The region's chief cultural influences have been from some combination of [[Islam]], [[Culture of India|India]], and [[Culture of China|China]]. Diverse cultural influence is pronounced in the Philippines, derived particularly from the period of the Spanish and American rule, contact with Indian-influenced cultures, and the Chinese and Japanese trading era.

As a rule, the peoples who ate with their fingers were more likely influenced by the culture of India, for example, than the culture of China, where the peoples ate with [[chopstick]]s; tea, as a beverage, can be found across the region. The [[fish sauce]]s distinctive to the region tend to vary.

===Arts===
[[File:Royal Ballet Camboda Apsara Mera.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Ballet of Cambodia]] (Paris, France 2010)]]

The arts of Southeast Asia have affinity with the arts of other areas. Dance in much of Southeast Asia includes movement of the hands as well as the feet, to express the dance's emotion and meaning of the story that the ballerina is going to tell the audience. Most of Southeast Asia introduced dance into their court; in particular, [[Khmer classical dance|Cambodian royal ballet]] represented them in the early 7th century before the [[Khmer Empire]], which was highly influenced by Indian Hinduism. [[Apsara Dance]], famous for strong hand and feet movement, is a great example of Hindu symbolic dance.

Puppetry and shadow plays were also a favoured form of entertainment in past centuries, a famous one being [[Wayang]] from Indonesia. The arts and literature in some of Southeast Asia is quite influenced by Hinduism, which was brought to them centuries ago. Indonesia, despite conversion to Islam which opposes certain forms of art, has retained many forms of Hindu-influenced practices, culture, art and literature. An example is the [[Wayang Kulit]] (Shadow Puppet) and literature like the [[Ramayana]]. The wayang kulit show has been recognized by [[UNESCO]] on 7 November 2003, as a [[Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].

It has been pointed out that Khmer and Indonesian classical arts were concerned with depicting the life of the gods, but to the Southeast Asian mind the life of the gods was the life of the peoples themselves—joyous, earthy, yet divine. The [[Tai peoples|Tai]], coming late into Southeast Asia, brought with them some Chinese artistic traditions, but they soon shed them in favour of the Khmer and [[Mon people|Mon]] traditions, and the only indications of their earlier contact with [[Culture of China|Chinese]] arts were in the style of their temples, especially the tapering roof, and in their [[lacquerware]].

====Music====
{{Main|Music of Southeast Asia}}
[[File:Angklung-arumba.jpg|thumb|right|[[Angklung]] as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].]]

Traditional music in Southeast Asia is as varied as its many ethnic and cultural divisions. Main styles of traditional music can be seen: Court music, folk music, music styles of smaller ethnic groups, and music influenced by genres outside the geographic region.

Of the court and folk genres, [[gong-chime]] ensembles and orchestras make up the majority (the exception being lowland areas of Vietnam). ''[[Gamelan]]'' and ''[[Angklung]]'' orchestras from ''[[Indonesia]]'', ''[[Piphat]]'' /''[[Pinpeat]]'' ensembles of Thailand and Cambodia and the ''[[Kulintang]]'' ensembles of the southern Philippines, [[Borneo]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Timor]] are the three main distinct styles of musical genres that have influenced other traditional musical styles in the region. String instruments also are popular in the region.

On 18 November 2010, UNESCO officially recognized angklung as a ''Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity'', and encourage Indonesian people and government to safeguard, transmit, promote performances and to encourage the craftsmanship of angklung making.

====Writing====
{{Main|Writing systems of Southeast Asia|Baybayin|Jawi script|S.E.A. Write Award|Thai alphabet}}
[[File:Thai manuscript Jim Thompson Museum IMG 7170.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thai script|Thai]] manuscript from before the 19th-century writing system.]]

The history of Southeast Asia has led to a wealth of different authors, from both within and without writing about the region.

Originally, [[Culture of India|Indians]] were the ones who taught the native inhabitants about writing. This is shown through [[Brahmic family|Brahmic]] forms of writing present in the region such as the [[Balinese script]] shown on split palm leaf called ''lontar'' (see image to the left — magnify the image to see the writing on the flat side, and the decoration on the reverse side).
[[File:Pura Puseh 05153.jpg|thumb|Sign in [[Balinese script|Balinese]] and [[Latin script|Latin]] script at a [[Hindu]] temple in [[Bali]]]]
The antiquity of this form of writing extends before the invention of paper around the year 100 in China. Note each palm leaf section was only several lines, written longitudinally across the leaf, and bound by twine to the other sections. The outer portion was decorated. The alphabets of Southeast Asia tended to be [[abugida]]s, until the arrival of the Europeans, who used words that also ended in consonants, not just vowels. Other forms of official documents, which did not use paper, included Javanese copperplate scrolls. This material would have been more durable than paper in the tropical climate of Southeast Asia.

In Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore, the Malay language is now generally written in the Latin script. The same phenomenon is present in Indonesian, although different spelling standards are utilised (e.g. 'Teksi' in Malay and 'Taksi' in Indonesian for the word 'Taxi').

The use of Chinese characters, in the past and present, is only evident in Vietnam and more recently, Singapore and Malaysia. The adoption of Chinese characters in Vietnam dates back to around 111 B.C., when it was occupied by the Chinese. A Vietnamese script called [[Chữ Nôm]] used modified Chinese characters to express the Vietnamese language. Both classical Chinese and Chữ Nôm were used up until the early 20th century.

However, the use of the Chinese script has been in decline, especially in Singapore and Malaysia as the younger generations are in favour of the Latin Script.
