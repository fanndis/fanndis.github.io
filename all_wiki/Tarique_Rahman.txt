==Family Background==

Rahman was born on 20 November 1967 to [[Ziaur Rahman]], the 7th President of Bangladesh, and [[Begum Khaleda Zia]], the 10th Prime Minister of Bangladesh. 

== Education ==
He studied at  Shaheen High School and College and completed his SSC from [[Dhaka Residential Model College]]. He then earned his HSC from [[Adamjee Cantonment College]]. He graduated in international relations from the [[University of Dhaka]].<ref name="personal">{{cite web |url=http://www.tariquerahman.net/index.php/2012-04-10-18-56-53/personal-life |title=Personal life |website=Tarique Rahman |access-date=2015-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116103937/http://www.tariquerahman.net/index.php/2012-04-10-18-56-53/personal-life |archive-date=2016-01-16 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Political Career==
Rahman started his political career as a primary member of the BNP [[Gabtali Upazila]], [[Bogura District]] in 1988.<ref name=joy>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/article/55362/জয়কে-নিয়ে-অন্ধকারে-আ.লীগ-নেতারা|script-title=bn:জয়কে নিয়ে অন্ধকারে আ.লীগ নেতারা|publisher=Prothom Alo|language=bn|access-date=2020-01-25|date=2013-10-13}}</ref>

Rahman actively assembled support for the party during the national elections of 1991, when the transition was taking place from the autocratic ruling to the democratic government.

=== Joining Politics ===
Rahman was a member of the BNP's National Campaign Strategy Committee, and was also responsible for coordinating the election campaigns in five constituencies from which his mother Khaleda Zia was contesting.<ref name="PoliticalThought">"The Political Thought of Tarique Rahman"</ref> 

=== Major Contribution in Politics ===
During that period, he proactively organized the BNP units of Bogura and changed the inherent cultures to make politics more production and development oriented.<ref name="PoliticalThought" />

After the BNP's success in the national elections of 1991 and the formation of the new government, Rahman was offered a senior role in the party as recognition of his contributions. However, he was reluctant to take up a higher position in order to have enough time to strengthen the party at the grassroots level. For many years, he remained active in developing the Bogura units of the BNP. During the national elections of 1996, the party grassroots and the senior leadership requested Rahman to contest a constituency from Bogura. But he declined the offer with a view to furthering his work at the grassroots levels and coordinating the election campaigns for his mother.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/RTV/1991/03/18/RTV180391005/?s=zia%20and%20bangladesh%20and%20parliament |title=Bangladesh, Begum Khaleda Zia Head Of Bangladesh National Party, Appointed First Woman Prime Minister |work=[[ITN Source]] |date=1991-03-18 |accessdate=2013-12-26}}</ref>

During the ruling of the [[Awami League]] government in 1996–2001, Rahman mobilized movements against the actions of the government. He actively campaigned to address issues of economic deprivation and started championing a countrywide consultation program aimed at publicizing the plight of the people living in rural areas.

This large-scale program, the first in the history of Bangladesh of this nature, drove mass mobilization against the government, which in turn, played an instrumental role in fostering the return of the BNP to power. He established the [[secret ballot]] system in Bogura to elect  leaders through open council.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news |url=http://www.prothom-alo.com/opinion/article/35956 |script-title=bn:হাসিনাপুত্রের অতিথি-রাজনীতি! |language=Bengali |newspaper=Prothom Alo |date=2013-08-07 |access-date=2013-12-21}}</ref>

In the national elections held in 2001, the party won a landslide victory with a two-thirds majority.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ecs.gov.bd/Bangla/ShareVote.php?&electionid=8&electionName=Parliament%20Election%202001 |title=Share of Votes by Party |website=Bangladesh Election Commission |access-date=2013-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224165000/http://www.ecs.gov.bd/Bangla/ShareVote.php?&electionid=8&electionName=Parliament%20Election%202001 |archive-date=2013-12-24 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Forced Exile ===
Tarique Rahman, is the prime convict to be the mastermind of [[21 August 2004 Dhaka attack|21 August 2004 terrorist grenade attack]] on a public rally organized by the then-opposition party [[Awami League]]. The attack using military grade Arges grenade targeted the entire top leadership of Awami League including current prime minister [[Sheikh Hasina]] and killed 24 Awami league leaders and workers including Ivy Rahman, President of Women Awami League and wife of late President Zillur Rahman. The attack also injured hundreds of victims and many became permanently crippled. He has been sentenced to life imprisonment by Bangladesh Court.<ref>{{cite news |title=It was Hawa Bhavan Plot |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-111469 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=2009-10-26 |access-date=2016-07-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/19-sentenced-to-death-19-to-life-imprisonment-in-in-2004-grenade-attack-in-bangladesh/articleshow/66146547.cms |title=19 sentenced to death, 19 to life imprisonment in 2004 grenade attack in Bangladesh |date=2018-10-10 |work=The Economic Times |access-date=2019-01-12}}</ref>

==Exile and asylum==
Following the release of Rahman's mother Khaleda Zia on 11 September 2008, he flew to [[London]], United Kingdom for medical treatment at Wellington hospital, an independent private hospital in [[St. John's Wood]]. The 1/11 interim government backed by the army confirmed that Rahman gave written bond of not to indulge in any future politics and was allowed to go abroad.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Britain to consider BNP chief’s visa|url=https://www.newagebd.net/article/117697/britain-to-consider-bnp-chiefs-visa|access-date=2020-11-08|website=New Age {{!}} The Most Popular Outspoken English Daily in Bangladesh|language=en}}</ref>

The [[Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh|Anti corruption Commission]] filed 12 cases against Rahman and his friend and business partner, [[Giasuddin Al Mamun]], which BNP claims is politically motivated and cases are being filed as part of the conspiracy of the immediate past [[caretaker government]] to prevent Rahman from participating in Bangladesh politics. On 16 October 2009 [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|the High Court]] issued a rule asking the government and the [[Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh]] to explain why the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case against Khaleda Zia and Rahman should not be quashed on a petition filed by Zia.<ref>{{cite news |title=HC asks why Zia Trust case will not be cancelled |url=http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=144957&cid=3 |newspaper=bdnews24.com |date=2009-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220192100/http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=144957&cid=3 |archive-date=2012-02-20}}</ref> On 9 November 2017, the Bangladesh Supreme Court dismissed Khaleda and Rahman's petition seeking stay on trial proceedings on the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case.

Khaleda Zia said her son would take part in active politics upon his return from abroad after completing treatment. She addressed a few public meetings on her way to Bogura and alleged that the present government is trying to harass her son so that he cannot return to the country. She said, "Tareque worked for the development of the country, but a lot of cases were filed only to destroy him as a part of national as well as international conspiracies" She also added, "On March 7, 2007, he was picked up in a car right in front of me. But after the custody my son had to be sent abroad in a stretcher for treatment...

==Cases and convictions==

===Money laundering case===
On 7 June 2007, a money laundering case was submitted against Rahman and his friend and business partner [[Giasuddin Al Mamun]] by the [[Bangladesh Anti Corruption Commission]] at a court in Dhaka. In a verdict given on 18 November 2013 by the court, Rahman was acquitted in the case involving BDT 20.41 crore.<ref>{{cite news |title=Money Laundering Case, Tarique acquitted |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/tarique-acquitted |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=2013-11-18 |access-date=2013-11-28}}</ref> The Bangladesh Anti Corruption Commission member Mohammad Shahabuddin rejected the verdict, saying: "''Tarique and Mamun had equal footing in the crime. So, legally there was no scope to differentiate.''"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/tarique-acquitted/ |title=Money Laundering Case &#124; Mamun jailed for 7 years; surprised BNP finds 'a brave judge in subservient judiciary' |work=The Daily Star |access-date=2013-12-26}}</ref>

BNP officials and leaders claimed that this judgement is a proof of his innocence and he had no involvement with corruption, and that all the cases against Rahman were "politically motivated".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/tarique-acquitted |title=Verdict proves Tarique innocent |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=2013-11-18 |access-date=2013-11-28}}</ref>

On 21 July 2016, Rahman was found guilty by the Bangladesh High Court overturning a lower court verdict that acquitted him earlier. He was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and fined Tk 20 crore by the Court. One interesting thing to note in this case here is right after delivering the controversial not-guilty verdict, the lower court judge fled the country. Rahman's money laundering case was the first case in the country's history where an FBI agent testified and produced evidence against a defendant in Bangladeshi court.<ref name=launder/> However, FBI has never confirmed this claim by the news paper Daily Star of Bangladesh.{{fact|date=September 2020}}

On 3 November 2008, a leaked [[US Embassy]] cable said that the embassy in Dhaka believed Rahman was "''guilty of egregious political corruption that has had a serious adverse effect on US national interests'".<ref>{{cite news |author=Shakhawat Liton and Shamim Ashraf |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=201716 |title=Tarique symbol of violent politics |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=2011-09-09 |access-date=2013-12-21}}</ref>

===2004 Dhaka grenade attack case===

On 10 October 2018, Rahman was sentenced to life in prison for the case of [[2004 Dhaka grenade attack]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/august-21-carnage/news/babar-17-others-get-death-tarique-awarded-life-1645090 |title=Babar, 17 others get death; Tarique awarded life |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=2018-10-10 |access-date=2018-10-10}}</ref> He was accused to be the mastermind of the attack by [[Awami League]] General Secretary [[Obaidul Quader]]. However, the accusation was denied by BNP Secretary General [[Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/politics/tarique-rahman-mastermind-august-21-grenade-attack-2004-1644787 |title=Tarique mastermind of August 21 grenade attack: Quader |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=2018-10-09 |access-date=2018-10-10}}</ref>
