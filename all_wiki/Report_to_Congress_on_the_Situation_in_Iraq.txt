The '''Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq''' (sometimes referred to as the '''Petraeus Report''') was a two-part report released on September 10, 2007 by [[General]] of the [[Multinational force in Iraq]] [[David H. Petraeus]] and [[U.S. Ambassador]] to [[Iraq]] [[Ryan Crocker]] on progress by the [[Politics of Iraq|Iraqi government]] in the ongoing [[Iraq War]].<ref name="Times">[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/washington/11policy.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1&oref=slogin "Petraeus Warns Against Quick Pullback in Iraq"].

==Report testimonies==

===Petraeus' testimony===
Petraeus concluded that "the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met". He cited what he called recent consistent declines in security incidents. He partially attributed those declines to recent blows dealt against [[Al-Qaeda]] during the surge. He added that "we have also disrupted [[Shia]] militia extremists, capturing the head and numerous other leaders of the Iranian-supported [[Quds Force|Special Groups]], along with a senior [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Hezbollah]] operative supporting Iran's activities in Iraq." He argued that [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition]] and [[Iraqi military|Iraqi]] operations had drastically reduced ethno-sectarian violence in the country, though he stated that the gains were not entirely even. As such, he recommended a gradual drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq, with a goal of reaching pre-surge troop levels by July 2008. Troop reductions would continue past this point as the situation warrants. Despite allegations that Petraeus' report would be written by the [[White House]],<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pullback15aug15,0,4840766.story?page=1&coll=la-home-center%2F "Top General May Propose Pullbacks."] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

===Crocker's testimony===
Though Crocker acknowledged slow political progress in many areas, and a lack of progress on many important pieces of legislation, he argued that, "a secure, stable democratic Iraq at peace with its neighbors is attainable." Though a national framework has fallen short of being implemented legislatively in key issues such as oil distribution, he observed that "even in the absence of legislation there is practical action as the central government shares oil revenues through budget allocations on an equitable basis with Iraq's provinces." He pointed out that provincial gains have been more pronounced, explaining that "there is abundant evidence that the security gains have opened the door for meaningful politics."<ref>[https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/nea/rls/rm/2007/91941.htm "Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq: Ambassador Crocker." 10 Sept 2007.] retrieved 10 September 2007.</ref>

==Response==

===US Congressional response===
Several [[United States Congress|Congressional]] [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] strongly criticised the report before it came out. [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[United States House|Representative]] [[Rahm Emanuel]] of [[Illinois]] stated that "We don't need a report that wins the [[Nobel Prize]] for creative statistics or the [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] for fiction."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3575785&page=1|title=Dems Bash Upcoming Petraeus Report|date=12 February 2009|website=ABC News}}</ref> After Petraeus' testimony, [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] of [[Nevada]] argued the General's "plan is just more of the same" and "is neither a drawdown or a change in mission that we need." He also said that Congressional Democrats plan "to change the course of the war".<ref>https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070912/ap_on_go_co/us_iraq;_ylt=AnBCfjVD3A8VO2KEOTCURaKs0NUE</ref>
