[[Elizabeth II]] was  '''Queen of Mauritius'''  from 1968 to 1992. [[Mauritius (1968–1992)|Mauritius]] was a [[constitutional monarchy]] with Elizabeth as [[head of state]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13882233|title=Mauritius country profile|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref> The Queen was also the monarch of the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Her constitutional roles in Mauritius were delegated to a [[List of Governors-General of Mauritius|Governor-General]].

The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]'s [[Mauritius Independence Act 1968]] transformed the [[British Mauritius|British Crown Colony of Mauritius]] into an independent [[sovereign state]]. Unusually, no member of the [[British royal family]] attended the independence ceremony on the island because of security concerns. [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]] was due to attend but after communal violence the British Minister of State for the Commonwealth, [[Malcolm Shepherd, 2nd Baron Shepherd|Lord Shepherd]], advised that her visit be cancelled.<ref>{{cite book|title=Monarchy and the End of Empire: The House of Windsor, the British Government, and the Postwar Commonwealth|author=Philip Murphy|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=84–85|isbn=978-0-19-921423-5}}</ref>

The Queen and her husband [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], visited Mauritius for three days (24–26 March) in 1972, as part of a tour of Asia and Africa. They arrived in [[Port Louis]] on the [[royal yacht]] ''[[HMY Britannia|Britannia]]'' after visiting the [[Seychelles]]. They were met by a crowd of nearly a quarter of a million people, and rode through the city in an open-topped car. During the visit, the Queen opened the sixth session of the third [[National Assembly (Mauritius)|Mauritius Parliament]]. The royal couple left Mauritius for [[Nairobi]] by air. It was the first ever visit to the island by a reigning monarch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//RTV/1972/03/24/BGY508150428/?s=motorcade |title=Mauritius: Queen Elizabeth Arrives for a Three-Day Visit to Mauritius |publisher=ITN |date= |accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref>

Mauritius became a [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|republic within the Commonwealth]] in 1992 with the [[President of Mauritius]] replacing the Queen as head of state. To date, Mauritius is the most recent of the Queen's realms to become a republic.
