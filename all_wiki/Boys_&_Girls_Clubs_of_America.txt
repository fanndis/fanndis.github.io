==History==
The first Boys' Club was founded in 1860 in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], by three women, Elizabeth Hamersley and sisters Mary and Alice Goodwin.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of African-American Education |first1=Lomotey |last1=Kofi |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=2010 |isbn=9781412940504 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dURVOtUlPKYC&pg=PA111}}</ref> In 1906, 53 independent Boys' Clubs came together in Boston to form a national organization, the Federated Boys' Clubs. In 1931, the organization renamed itself Boys' Clubs of America, and in 1990, to Boys & Girls Clubs of America. As of 2010, there are over 4,000 autonomous local clubs, which are affiliates of the national organization. In total these clubs serve more than four million boys and girls. Clubs can be found in all 50 states as well as locations in [[Puerto Rico]], the [[US Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]], and US military bases. In total, Boys & Girls Clubs of America employ about 50,000 staff members.<ref>Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Boys & Girls Club Leadership University.
