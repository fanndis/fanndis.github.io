'''John Forbes Kerry''' (born December 11, 1943) is an American politician and diplomat who served as the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States|68th]] [[United States Secretary of State]] from 2013 to 2017. An attorney and former naval officer, Kerry first drew public attention as a decorated Vietnam veteran turned anti-war activist. He went on to serve as a prosecutor and as [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts]], before serving as [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]] from 1985 to 2013. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was the Democratic nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]], which he lost to incumbent President [[George W. Bush]].

Kerry grew up as a [[military brat]] in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] before attending [[boarding school]] in [[Massachusetts]] and [[New Hampshire]]. In 1966, after graduating from [[Yale University]], Kerry enlisted in the [[United States Naval Reserve]], ultimately attaining the rank of [[lieutenant (naval)|lieutenant]]. From 1968 to 1969, during the [[Vietnam War]], he served an abbreviated four-month tour of duty in [[South Vietnam]]. While serving as the commanding officer of a [[Patrol Craft Fast|Swift boat]], Kerry sustained three wounds in combat with the [[Viet Cong]], earning three [[Purple Heart Medals]]. Kerry was awarded the [[Silver Star Medal]] and the [[Bronze Star Medal]] for valorous conduct in separate military engagements. After completing his active military service, Kerry returned to the United States and became an outspoken [[opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opponent of the Vietnam War]]. He gained national recognition as an anti-war activist, serving as a spokesperson for the [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]] organization. Kerry testified in the [[Fulbright Hearings]] before the [[Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], where he described the United States government's policy in Vietnam as the cause of [[war crimes]].

In 1972, Kerry entered electoral politics as a Democratic candidate for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[Massachusetts' 5th congressional district]]. Kerry won the Democratic nomination but was defeated in the general election by his Republican opponent. He subsequently worked as a [[radio talk show]] host in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] and as the executive director of an advocacy organization while attending the [[Boston College School of Law]]. After obtaining his [[juris doctor]] in 1976, Kerry served from 1977 to 1979 as the First Assistant District Attorney of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]], where he tried criminal cases and managed the district attorney's office. After a period in private legal practice, Kerry was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts]] in 1982. In 1984, Kerry was elected to the [[United States Senate]]. As a member of the [[Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], he led a [[Kerry Committee report|series of hearings]] investigating [[narcotics]] trafficking in [[Latin America]], which exposed aspects of the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. He was reelected to additional terms in [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1990|1990]], [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1996|1996]], [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2002|2002]] and [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2008|2008]].

Kerry won the Democratic party presidential nomination in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], alongside vice presidential nominee and [[North Carolina]] Senator [[John Edwards]]. Kerry campaigned as a critic of Republican President George W. Bush's prosecution of the [[Iraq War]] and advocated a [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] domestic policy. Kerry lost the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] and the popular vote by narrow margins, winning 251 electors to Bush's 286 and 48.3% of the popular vote to Bush's 50.7%. Kerry remained in the Senate and chaired the [[Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Committee on Foreign Relations]] from 2009 to 2013. In January 2013, he was nominated by President [[Barack Obama]] to succeed outgoing Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], and was confirmed by his Senate colleagues on a vote of 94–3. As Secretary of State, Kerry initiated the [[2013–2014 Israeli–Palestinian peace talks]] and negotiated landmark agreements restricting the [[nuclear program of Iran]], including the 2013 [[Joint Plan of Action]] and the 2015 [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]]. In 2015, Kerry signed the [[Paris Agreement]] on [[climate change]] on behalf of the United States. Kerry served as Secretary of State until the end of the Obama administration in January 2017, when he retired from government service. Kerry has remained active in public affairs as a vocal opponent of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Donald Trump]] and as a supporter of [[Joe Biden]], the [[President-elect of the United States]].

On November 23, 2020, President-elect [[Joe Biden]] announced that Kerry will serve as the [[U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate]] in the [[Biden administration]].<ref name="wsj-confirm-nom">{{cite news |title=Biden Reveals Some Cabinet Picks |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-reveals-some-cabinet-picks-11606152632 |access-date=23 November 2020 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=23 November 2020 |archive-date=November 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201123173716/https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-reveals-some-cabinet-picks-11606152632 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Military service (1966–1970)==
{{Main|Military career of John Kerry}}

===Duty on USS ''Gridley''===
On February 18, 1966, Kerry enlisted in the Naval Reserve.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20040723192004/http://www.johnkerry.com/pdf/jkmilservice/Request_For_History_of_Service.pdf</ref> He began his active duty military service on August 19, 1966. After completing 16 weeks of [[Officer Candidate School]] at the U.S. Naval Training Center in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], Kerry received his officer's commission on December 16, 1966. During the 2004 election, Kerry posted his military records at his website, and permitted reporters to inspect his medical records. In 2005, Kerry released his military and medical records to the representatives of three news organizations, but has not authorized full public access to those records.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Kranish |title=Kerry allows Navy release of military, medical records |url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/06/07/kerry_allows_navy_release_of_military_medical_records/ |date=June 7, 2005 |work=The Boston Globe |access-date=February 19, 2020 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184426/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/06/07/kerry_allows_navy_release_of_military_medical_records/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Josh |last=Gerstein |title=Kerry Grants Three Reporters Broad Access to Navy Records |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/15790 |date=June 21, 2005 |access-date=July 30, 2006 |archive-date=June 23, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050623022455/http://www.nysun.com/article/15790 |url-status=live }}</ref>

During his tour on the [[guided missile]] [[frigate]] {{USS|Gridley|DLG-21|6}}, Kerry requested duty in South Vietnam, listing as his first preference a position as the commander of a [[Fast Patrol Craft]] (PCF), also known as a "Swift boat."<ref name="rqstswiftboat">[http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/rqstswiftboat.pdf Official Record Copy of request for duty in Vietnam] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/65109EQir?url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/rqstswiftboat.pdf |date=January 27, 2012 }}.

===Military honors===
During the night of December 2 and early morning of December 3, 1968, Kerry was in charge of a small boat operating near a peninsula north of [[Cam Ranh Bay]] together with a Swift boat (PCF-60). According to Kerry and the two crewmen who accompanied him that night, Patrick Runyon and William Zaladonis, they surprised a group of Vietnamese men unloading [[sampan]]s at a river crossing, who began running and failed to obey an order to stop. As the men fled, Kerry and his crew opened fire on the sampans and destroyed them, then rapidly left. During this encounter, Kerry received a shrapnel wound in the left arm above the elbow. It was for this injury that Kerry received his first [[Purple Heart|Purple Heart Medal]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/04/17/kerry_purple/index.html |work=Salon |title=John Kerry's first Purple Heart |first=Douglas |last=Brinkley |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/658F4pZWb?url=http://www.salon.com/2004/04/17/kerry_purple/ |archive-date=February 1, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Kerry received his second Purple Heart for a wound received in action on the [[Bồ Đề River]] on February 20, 1969. The plan had been for the Swift boats to be accompanied by support helicopters. On the way up the Bo De, however, the helicopters were attacked. As the Swift boats reached the [[Cửa Lớn River]], Kerry's boat was hit by a [[RPG-2|B-40 rocket]] (rocket propelled grenade round), and a piece of [[Shrapnel (fragment)|shrapnel]] hit Kerry's left leg, wounding him. Thereafter, enemy fire ceased and his boat reached the [[Gulf of Thailand]] safely. Kerry continues to have shrapnel embedded in his left thigh because the doctors that first treated him decided to remove the damaged tissue and close the wound with [[surgical suture|sutures]] rather than make a wide opening to remove the shrapnel.<ref name="Rasmussen1">{{cite web|url=http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/Doyle.pdf|title=Primary Sources: John Kerry's Vietnam Medals|first=Eric|last=Rasmussen|year=2004|work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review|publisher=kerryvietnam.org|accessdate=September 5, 2013|archive-date=December 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203060951/http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/Doyle.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Although wounded like several others earlier that day, Kerry did not lose any time off from duty.<ref name="Rasmussen2">{{cite web|url=http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/SeaLords324.pdf|title=Primary Sources: John Kerry's Vietnam Medals|first=Eric|last=Rasmussen|year=2004|work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review|publisher=kerryvietnam.org|accessdate=September 5, 2013|archive-date=December 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000557/http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/SeaLords324.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Rasmussen3">{{cite web|url=http://www.kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/SeaLords312-316.pdf|title=Part I: John Kerry in Vietnam|first=Eric|last=Rasmussen|year=2004|work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review|publisher=kerryvietnam.org|accessdate=September 5, 2013|archive-date=December 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020420/http://www.kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/SeaLords312-316.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Silver Star====
Eight days later, on February 28, 1969, came the events for which Kerry was awarded his [[Silver Star Medal]]. On this occasion, Kerry was in tactical command of his Swift boat and two other Swift boats during a combat operation. Their mission on the [[Duong Keo River]] included bringing an underwater demolition team and dozens of South Vietnamese Marines to destroy enemy [[sampan]]s, structures and bunkers as described in the story ''The Death Of PCF 43''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mwweb.com/ndc/SwiftBoats/pcf43.htm |title=LTJG Peter N.

Moving a short distance upstream, Kerry's boat was the target of a B-40 rocket round; Kerry charged the enemy positions and as his boat [[Heaving to|hove to]] and [[Beaching (nautical)|beached]], a Viet Cong ("VC") insurgent armed with a rocket launcher emerged from a [[spider hole]] and ran. While the boat's gunner opened fire, wounding the VC in the leg, and while the other boats approached and offered cover fire, Kerry jumped from the boat to pursue the VC insurgent, subsequently killing him and capturing his loaded rocket launcher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/jksilverstar.pdf |title=Silver Star Medal – John F.

Kerry's commanding officer, [[Lieutenant Commander]] George Elliott, stated to [[Douglas Brinkley]] in 2003 that he did not know whether to court-martial Kerry for beaching the boat without orders or give him a medal for saving the crew. Elliott recommended Kerry for the Silver Star, and Zumwalt flew into An Thoi to personally award medals to Kerry and the rest of the sailors involved in the mission. The Navy's account of Kerry's actions is presented in the original [[s:Silver Star Citation - John Kerry|medal citation]] signed by Zumwalt. The engagement was documented in an after-action report, a press release written on March 1, 1969, and a historical summary dated March 17, 1969.<ref name=Rasmussen6>{{cite web|url=http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/Monthly_Historical_Summary.pdf|title=Primary Sources: John Kerry's Vietnam Medals|first=Eric|last=Rasmussen|year=2004|work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review|publisher=kerryvietnam.org|accessdate=September 5, 2013|archive-date=March 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304152152/http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/Monthly_Historical_Summary.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Bronze Star====
On March 13, 1969, on the Bái Háp River, Kerry was in charge of one of five Swift boats that were returning to their base after performing an [[Operation Sealords]] mission to transport South Vietnamese troops from the garrison at [[Cái Nước]] and [[MIKE Force]] advisors for a raid on a Vietcong camp located on the Rach Dong Cung canal. Earlier in the day, Kerry received a slight shrapnel wound in the buttocks from blowing up a rice bunker. Debarking some but not all of the passengers at a small village, the boats approached a fishing [[weir]]; one group of boats went around to the left of the weir, hugging the shore, and a group with Kerry's PCF-94 boat went around to the right, along the shoreline. A mine was detonated directly beneath the lead boat, PCF-3, as it crossed the weir to the left, lifting PCF-3 "about 2-3 ft out of water".<ref name=Rasmussen7>{{cite web|url=http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/SeaLords358.pdf|title=Primary Sources: John Kerry's Vietnam Medals|first=Eric|last=Rasmussen|year=2004|work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review|publisher=kerryvietnam.org|accessdate=September 5, 2013|archive-date=December 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206150647/http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/SeaLords358.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[James Rassmann]], a [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] advisor who was aboard Kerry's PCF-94, was knocked overboard when, according to witnesses and the documentation of the event, a mine or rocket exploded close to the boat. According to the documentation for the event, Kerry's arm was injured when he was thrown against a bulkhead during the explosion. PCF 94 returned to the scene and Kerry rescued Rassmann who was receiving sniper fire from the water. Kerry received the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with [[Combat "V"]] for "heroic achievement", for his actions during this incident; he also received his third Purple Heart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/jkbronzestar.pdf |title=Bronze Star Medal – John F.

==="Swiftboating" controversy===
{{Main|John Kerry military service controversy}}
With the continuing [[George W. Bush military service controversy|controversy]] that had surrounded the military service of [[George W. Bush]] since the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 Presidential election]] (when he was accused of having used his father's political influence to gain entrance to the [[Texas Air National Guard]], thereby protecting himself from conscription into the [[United States Army]], and possible service in the [[Vietnam War]]), John Kerry's contrasting status as a decorated Vietnam War veteran posed a problem for Bush's re-election campaign, which Republicans sought to counter by calling Kerry's war record into question. As the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, approximately 250 members of a group called [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]] (SBVT, later renamed Swift Vets and POWs for Truth) opposed Kerry's campaign. The group held press conferences, ran ads and endorsed a book questioning Kerry's service record and his military awards. The group included several members of Kerry's unit, such as Larry Thurlow, who commanded a swift boat alongside of Kerry's,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5765243 |title='Hardball with Chris Matthews' for August 19 |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=August 19, 2004 |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |archive-date=March 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304184306/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5765243 |url-status=live }}</ref> and Stephen Gardner, who served on Kerry's boat.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,599034,00.html | work=Time | first=Douglas | last=Brinkley | title=The Tenth Brother | date=March 9, 2004 | access-date=February 8, 2011 | archive-date=August 17, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817045815/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,599034,00.html | url-status=live }}</ref> The campaign inspired the widely used political pejorative '[[swiftboating]]', to describe an unfair or untrue political attack.<ref name="Casey">{{cite journal |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/dissent/v056/56.2.casey.html |title=No redemption song: The Case of Bill Ayers |last=Casey |first=Leo |date=Spring 2009 |journal=Dissent |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |volume=56 |number=2 |pages=107–111 |issn=0012-3846 |doi=10.1353/dss.0.0041 |s2cid=143605641 |quote=In recent elections, the patriotism and good names of Democratic war hero candidates, from John Kerry to Max Cleland, had been impugned so successfully that a neologism for such smears—to 'swift boat'—was coined out of the assault on Kerry. |access-date=November 24, 2020 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304121603/http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=%2Fjournals%2Fdissent%2Fv056%2F56.2.casey.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Most of Kerry's former crewmates have stated that SBVT's allegations are false.<ref>* {{cite news |first=Zachary |last=Coile |title=Vets group attacks Kerry; McCain defends Democrat |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/08/06/MNGUT83SS41.DTL |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=August 6, 2004 |archive-date=March 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328140333/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F08%2F06%2FMNGUT83SS41.DTL |url-status=live }}

On April 22, 1971, Kerry appeared before a U.S. Senate committee hearing on proposals relating to ending the war. The day after this testimony, Kerry participated in a demonstration with thousands of other veterans in which he and other Vietnam War veterans threw their medals and service ribbons over a fence erected at the front steps of the [[United States Capitol]] building to dramatize their opposition to the war. Jack Smith, a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]], read a statement explaining why the veterans were returning their military awards to the government. For more than two hours, almost 1000 angry veterans tossed their medals, ribbons, hats, jackets, and military papers over the fence. Each veteran gave his or her name, hometown, branch of service and a statement. Kerry threw some of his own decorations and awards as well as some given to him by other veterans to throw. As Kerry threw his decorations over the fence, his statement was: "I'm not doing this for any violent reasons, but for peace and justice, and to try and make this country wake up once and for all."<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Oliphant |author-link=Tom Oliphant |title=I watched Kerry throw his war decorations |url=https://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/04/27/i_watched_kerry_throw_his_war_decorations/ |work=The Boston Globe |date=April 27, 2004 |access-date=February 19, 2020 |archive-date=November 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124213703/http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/04/27/i_watched_kerry_throw_his_war_decorations/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Kerry was arrested on May 30, 1971, during a VVAW march to honor American [[prisoner of war|POWs]] held captive by [[North Vietnam]]. The march was planned as a multi-day event from [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] to Boston, and while in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], participants tried to camp on the village green. At 2:30&nbsp;a.m., local and state police arrested 441 demonstrators, including Kerry, for trespassing. All were given the [[Miranda Warning]] and were hauled away on school buses to spend the night at the Lexington Public Works Garage. Kerry and the other protesters later paid a $5 fine, and were released. The mass arrests caused a community backlash and ended up giving positive coverage to the VVAW.<ref>Unfinished Symphony: Democracy and Dissent – Documentary, 2001.</ref><ref>Against the Vietnam War: Writings by Activists, Mary Susannah Robbins, pp. 78–90.</ref><ref>Lexington Minute-Man Newspaper, May 23, 1991.</ref>

==Early political career (1972–1985)==

===1972 congressional election===
In 1970, Kerry had considered running for Congress in the Democratic primary against hawkish Democrat [[Philip J. Philbin]] of [[Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district]], but deferred in favor of [[Robert Drinan]], a Jesuit priest and anti-war activist, who went on to defeat Philbin.<ref name="citm-pt4">{{cite news |first=Brian C.|last=Mooney |title=First campaign ends in defeat |url=https://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061803.shtml |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 18, 2003 |accessdate=April 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031002060303/http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061803.shtml|archive-date=October 2, 2003}}</ref> In February 1972, Kerry's wife bought a house in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], with Kerry intending to run against the [[Massachusetts's 4th congressional district|4th district's]] aging thirteen-term incumbent Democrat, [[Harold Donohue]].<ref name="citm-pt4"/> The couple never moved in. After Republican Congressman [[F. Bradford Morse]] of the neighboring [[Massachusetts's 5th congressional district|5th district]] announced his retirement and then resignation to become [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs]] at the [[United Nations]], the couple instead rented an apartment in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], so that Kerry could run to succeed him.<ref name="citm-pt4"/>

Including Kerry, the Democratic primary race had 10 candidates, including attorney [[Paul J. Sheehy]], State Representative Anthony R. DiFruscia, John J. Desmond and [[Robert B. Kennedy]]. Kerry ran a "very expensive, sophisticated campaign", financed by out-of-state backers and supported by many young volunteers.<ref name="citm-pt4"/> DiFruscia's campaign headquarters shared the same building as Kerry's. On the eve of the September 19 primary, police found Kerry's younger brother [[Cameron Kerry|Cameron]] and campaign field director Thomas J. Vallely, breaking into where the building's telephone lines were located. They were arrested and charged with "[[burglary|breaking and entering]] with the intent to commit [[grand larceny]]", but the charges were dropped a year later. At the time of the incident, DiFruscia alleged that the two were trying to disrupt his get-out-the vote efforts. Vallely and Cameron Kerry maintained that they were only checking their own telephone lines because they had received an anonymous call warning that the Kerry lines would be cut.<ref name="citm-pt4"/>

Despite the arrests, Kerry won the primary with 20,771 votes (27.56%). Sheehy came second with 15,641 votes (20.75%), followed by DiFruscia with 12,222 votes (16.22%), Desmond with 10,213 votes (13.55%) and Kennedy with 5,632 votes (7.47%). The remaining 10,891 votes were split amongst the other five candidates, with 1970 nominee Richard Williams coming last with just 1,706 votes (2.26%).<ref name="citm-pt4"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=382445|title=MA District 5 - D Primary 1972|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=April 9, 2016|archive-date=April 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423130149/http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=382445|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the general election, Kerry was initially favored to defeat the Republican candidate, former State Representative [[Paul W. Cronin]], and conservative Democrat Roger P. Durkin, who ran as an Independent. A week after the primary, one poll put Kerry 26-points ahead of Cronin.<ref name="citm-pt4"/> His campaign called for a national health insurance system, discounted prescription drugs for the unemployed, a jobs program to clean up the [[Merrimack River]] and rent controls in Lowell and [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]]. A major obstacle, however, was the district's leading newspaper, the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] ''[[The Sun (Lowell)|The Sun]]''. The paper editorialized against him. It also ran critical news stories about his out-of-state contributions and his "[[carpetbagger|carpetbagging]]", because he had only moved into the district in April. Subsequently, released "Watergate" Oval Office tape recordings of the Nixon White House showed that defeating Kerry's candidacy had attracted the personal attention of President Nixon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/24/politics/campaign/echoes-of-a-1972-loss-haunt-a-2004-campaign.html|title=Echoes of a 1972 Loss Haunt a 2004 Campaign|author=Todd Purdum|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 24, 2004|accessdate=April 9, 2016|archive-date=July 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717162650/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/24/politics/campaign/echoes-of-a-1972-loss-haunt-a-2004-campaign.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Kerry himself asserts that Nixon sent operatives to Lowell to help derail his campaign.<ref name="citm-pt4"/>

In January 1977, Droney promoted him to First Assistant District Attorney, essentially making Kerry his campaign and media surrogate because Droney was afflicted with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS, or [[Lou Gehrig]]'s Disease). As First Assistant, Kerry tried cases, which included winning convictions in a high-profile rape case and a murder.

Droney's health was poor and Kerry had decided to run for his position in the 1978 election should Droney drop out.

===Iran–Contra hearings===
{{Main|Kerry Committee report}}
On April 18, 1985, a few months after taking his Senate seat, Kerry and Senator [[Tom Harkin]] of [[Iowa]] traveled to [[Nicaragua]] and met the country's president, [[Daniel Ortega]]. Although Ortega had won internationally certified elections, the trip was criticized because Ortega and his [[leftist]] [[Sandinista]] government had strong ties to [[Cuba]] and the [[USSR]] and were accused of human rights abuses. The Sandinista government was opposed by the [[right-wing]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-backed rebels known as the [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contras]]. While in Nicaragua, Kerry and Harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict. Through the senators, Ortega offered a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the U.S. dropping support of the Contras. The offer was denounced by the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration as a "[[propaganda]] initiative" designed to influence a House vote on a $14 million Contra [[foreign aid|aid package]], but Kerry said "I am willing. ... . to take the risk in the effort to put to test the good faith of the Sandinistas." The House voted down the Contra aid, but Ortega flew to Moscow to accept a $200 million loan the next day, which in part prompted the House to pass a larger $27 million aid package six weeks later.<ref name="citm-pt6">{{cite news |first=John Aloysius |last=Farrell |title=With probes, making his mark |url=https://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062003.shtml |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 20, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030621071459/http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062003.shtml|archive-date=June 21, 2003 |accessdate=July 7, 2018}}</ref>

[[File:JohnKerry.jpg|thumb|A Senate portrait of Kerry]]
Meanwhile, Kerry's staff began their own investigations and, on October 14, issued a report that exposed illegal activities on the part of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Oliver North]], who had set up a private network involving the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the CIA to deliver military equipment to right-wing Nicaraguan rebels (Contras). In effect, North and certain members of the President's administration were accused by Kerry's report of illegally funding and supplying armed militants without the authorization of Congress. Kerry's staff investigation, based on a year-long inquiry and interviews with fifty unnamed sources, is said to raise "serious questions about whether the United States has abided by the law in its handling of the contras over the past three years."<ref>{{cite news |date=October 15, 1986 |title=White House Official Linked To Arms Deliveries to Contras |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=6 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3D71339F936A25753C1A960948260 |access-date=February 9, 2017 |archive-date=November 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124213634/https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/15/world/white-house-official-linked-to-arms-deliveries-to-contras.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Kerry Committee report]] found that "the Contra drug links included. ... . payments to drug traffickers by the U.S. State Department of funds authorized by the Congress for humanitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies."<ref name="report">{{cite web |url=http://www.pinknoiz.com/covert/contracoke.html |title=Selections from the Senate Committee Report on Drugs, Law Enforcement and Foreign Policy chaired by Senator John F.

The Kerry report was a precursor to the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. On May 4, 1989, North was convicted of charges relating to the Iran/Contra controversy, including three felonies. On September 16, 1991, however, North's convictions were overturned on appeal.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Johnston |date=December 24, 1992 |title=Bush Pardons 6 In Iran Affair, Aborting A Weinberger Trial; Prosecutor Assails 'Cover-Up' Bush Diary at Issue 6-Year Inquiry Into Deal of Arms for Hostages All but Swept Away |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/991224onthisday_big.html |access-date=February 9, 2017 |archive-date=July 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722020738/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/991224onthisday_big.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===George H. W. Bush administration===
On November 15, 1988, at a businessmen's breakfast in [[Lynn, Massachusetts|East Lynn]], Massachusetts, Kerry made a joke about then-[[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and his running mate, saying "if Bush is shot, the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] has orders to shoot [[Dan Quayle]]." He apologized the following day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&p_theme=sl&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB32978E9020931&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date |title=Senator repudiates 'Shoot Quayle' joke |publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch Archives/AP via Nl.newsbank.com |date=November 17, 1988 |accessdate=March 12, 2010 |archive-date=May 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514155844/http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&p_theme=sl&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB32978E9020931&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date |url-status=live }}</ref>

During their investigation of General [[Manuel Noriega]], the ''de facto'' ruler of [[Panama]], Kerry's staff found reason to believe that the [[Pakistan]]-based [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] (BCCI) had facilitated Noriega's drug trafficking and [[money laundering]]. This led to a separate inquiry into BCCI, and as a result, banking regulators shut down BCCI in 1991. In December 1992, Kerry and Senator [[Hank Brown]], a Republican from Colorado, released ''The BCCI Affair'', a report on the BCCI scandal. The report showed that the bank was crooked and was working with [[terrorism|terrorists]], including [[Abu Nidal]]. It blasted the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]], the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve Bank]], as well as influential [[lobbying|lobbyists]] and the CIA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.sirota.html |title=Follow the Money |last=Sirota |first=David |author2=Baskin, Jonathan |date=September 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040911081424/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.sirota.html |archive-date=September 11, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Kerry was criticized by some Democrats for having pursued his own party members, including former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Clark Clifford]], although Republicans said he should have pressed against some Democrats even harder. The BCCI scandal was later turned over to the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney]]'s office.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bcci/19rogers.htm |title=The BCCI Affair – 19 Ed Rogers and Kamal Adham |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=March 12, 2010 |archive-date=December 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224193511/http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bcci/19rogers.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Precursors to presidential bid===
{{See also|1996 Massachusetts United States Senate election|United States presidential election, 2000}}
In 1996, Kerry faced a difficult re-election fight against Governor [[William Weld]], a popular Republican incumbent who had been re-elected in 1994 with 71% of the vote. The race was covered nationwide as one of the most closely watched Senate races that year. Kerry and Weld held several debates and negotiated a campaign spending cap of $6.9 million at Kerry's [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]] townhouse. Both candidates spent more than the cap, with each camp accusing the other of being first to break the agreement.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rimer |first=Sara |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E5D91130F936A15753C1A960958260 |title=Promises Yield to Old-Fashioned Politics |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 25, 1996 |accessdate=March 12, 2010 |archive-date=January 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6510HXuUW?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/25/us/promises-yield-to-old-fashioned-politics.html |url-status=live }}</ref> During the campaign, Kerry spoke briefly at the [[1996 Democratic National Convention]].

In the 2000 presidential election, Kerry found himself close to being chosen as the vice presidential running mate.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Battenfeld |title=Kerry's stock rises in VP sweepstakes |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LOCAL/northeast/07/14/boh.kerry.veep/index.html |date=July 14, 2000 |work=CNN |access-date=September 9, 2005 |archive-date=September 11, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050911144921/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LOCAL/northeast/07/14/boh.kerry.veep/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

A release from the presidential campaign of presumptive Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]] listed Kerry on the short list to be selected as the vice-presidential nominee, along with North Carolina Senator [[John Edwards]], Indiana Senator [[Evan Bayh]], Missouri Congressman [[Richard Gephardt]], New Hampshire Governor [[Jeanne Shaheen]] and Connecticut Senator [[Joe Lieberman]].<ref>{{cite news | url =http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Gore-Trims-VP-List-To-Six-Senators-Have-Inside-2745572.php | title =Gore Trims VP List To Six – Senators Have Inside Track / Bradley could be 'wild card' pick | newspaper =[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date =August 4, 2000 | accessdate =January 9, 2013 | first =Ceci | last =Connolly | archive-date =May 16, 2013 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130516174921/http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Gore-Trims-VP-List-To-Six-Senators-Have-Inside-2745572.php | url-status =live }}</ref> Gore ultimately chose Lieberman.

On October 30, 2006, Kerry was a headline speaker at a campaign rally being held for Democratic [[2006 California gubernatorial election|California gubernatorial candidate]] [[Phil Angelides]] at [[Pasadena City College]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. Speaking to an audience composed mainly of college students, Kerry said, "You know, education, if you make the most of it, you study hard, you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart, you can do well.

The day after the remarks were made public, leaders from both sides of the political spectrum criticized Kerry's remarks, which he said were a botched joke. Republicans including President George W. Bush, Senator [[John McCain]] and then-Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]], said that Kerry's comments were insulting to American military forces fighting in Iraq.

===Voting record===

====Overall====
Most analyses place Kerry's voting record on the left within the Senate Democratic caucus.<ref>[http://www.factcheck.org/how_liberal_is_john_kerry.html How Liberal is John Kerry?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021071039/http://www.factcheck.org/how_liberal_is_john_kerry.html |date=October 21, 2012 }} FactCheck.org. Retrieved January 28, 2013.</ref> During the 2004 presidential election he was portrayed as a staunch [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] by conservative groups and the Bush campaign, who often noted that in 2003 Kerry was rated the ''[[National Journal]]'''s top Senate liberal. However, that rating was based only upon voting on legislation within that past year. In fact, in terms of career voting records, the ''National Journal'' found that Kerry is the 11th most liberal member of the Senate. Most analyses find that Kerry is at least slightly more liberal than the typical Democratic Senator. Kerry has stated that he opposes privatizing [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], supports [[abortion]] rights for adult women and minors, supports [[same-sex marriage]], opposes [[capital punishment]] except for [[terrorists]], supports most [[Gun politics in the United States#Gun control laws|gun control laws]], and is generally a supporter of trade agreements. In some of these, as in the case of abortion, Kerry distinguishes his personal views as in line with his Catholic faith, but believes that separation of church and state demands that he not legislate his religious beliefs upon those who do not share those beliefs.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Olsen|first=Compiled by Ted|title=Why Kerry Is Sincere When He Says He Believes Life Begins at Conception|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/julyweb-only/7-5-31.0.html|access-date=2020-06-23|website=ChristianityToday.com|language=en|archive-date=June 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200624160947/https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/julyweb-only/7-5-31.0.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Kerry supported the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and [[Most Favored Nation]] status for China, but opposed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In the lead up to the [[Iraq War]], Kerry said on October 9, 2002; "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." Bush relied on that resolution in ordering the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Kerry also gave a January 23, 2003 speech to [[Georgetown University]] saying "Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator; leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real." Kerry did, however, warn that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war: "Mr. President, do not rush to war, take the time to build the coalition, because it's not winning the war that's hard, it's winning the peace that's hard."<ref>{{cite news |title=Kerry Makes It Official |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/02/politics/main571162.shtml |publisher=[[CBS]] |date=September 2, 2003 |access-date=October 21, 2005 |archive-date=February 9, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209024140/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/02/politics/main571162.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Seniority===
{{Main|Seniority in the United States Senate}}
From the beginning of the [[113th United States Congress]] until his resignation, Kerry ranked as the 7th most senior U.S. Senator. Due to the [[longevity]] of Ted Kennedy's service, Kerry was the most senior ''junior Senator'' in the [[List of United States Senators in the 111th Congress by seniority|111th United States Congress]]. On Tuesday, August 25, 2009, Kerry became the senior senator from Massachusetts following Ted Kennedy's death.

In the 2004 Democratic [[United States presidential primary|presidential primaries]], John Kerry defeated several Democratic rivals, including Sen. [[John Edwards]] (D-North Carolina), former Vermont Governor [[Howard Dean]] and retired [[United States Army|Army]] General [[Wesley Clark]]. His victory in the Iowa caucuses is widely believed to be the tipping point where Kerry revived his sagging campaign in New Hampshire and the February 3, 2004, primary states like Arizona, South Carolina and New Mexico. Kerry then went on to win landslide victories in Nevada and Wisconsin. Kerry thus won the Democratic nomination to run for President of the United States against incumbent George W. Bush. On July 6, 2004, he announced his selection of [[John Edwards]] as his running mate. Democratic strategist [[Bob Shrum]], who was Kerry's 2004 campaign adviser, wrote an article in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] claiming that after the election, Kerry had said that he wished he had never picked Edwards, and that the two have since stopped speaking to each other.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shrum |first=Robert |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1626498-2,00.html |title=Kerry's Regrets About John Edwards |publisher=Time.com |date=May 30, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2010 |archive-date=January 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6510J7H8x?url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1626498-2,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In a subsequent appearance on ABC's ''This Week'', Kerry refused to respond to Shrum's allegation, calling it a "ridiculous waste of time."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/13/kerry-disregards-bob-shru_n_81260.html |title=Kerry Disregards Bob Shrum Book: "Ridiculous Waste Of Time" |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=January 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 12, 2010 |first=Nico |last=Pitney |archive-date=April 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406220942/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/13/kerry-disregards-bob-shru_n_81260.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Kerry, baby, horizontal.jpg|thumb|Kerry on the campaign trail in [[Rochester, Minnesota]]]]
During his bid to be elected president in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], Kerry frequently criticized President [[George W. Bush]] for starting the [[Iraq War]].<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5552784/ "Text of Kerry's Acceptance Speech,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225113247/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5552784/ |date=December 25, 2013 }}, [[NBC News]], July 29, 2004. "Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so. Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn't make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so."</ref> While Kerry had initially voted in support of authorizing President Bush to use force in dealing with Saddam Hussein, he voted against an $87 billion supplemental appropriations bill to pay for the subsequent war. His statement on March 16, 2004, "I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it," helped the Bush campaign to paint him as a [[flip-flopper]] and has been cited as contributing to Kerry's defeat.<ref name="baroneandcohen">{{cite book|first1=Michael|last1=Barone|first2=Richard E.|last2=Cohen|title=The Almanac of American Politics 2010|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=National Journal Group|year=2009|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780892341207/page/731 731]|isbn=978-0-89234-120-7|author-link=Michael Barone (pundit)|quote=Bush's job approval hovered under 50%, and he trailed Kerry in polls for much of the seven-month campaign.

On November 3, 2004, Kerry conceded the race. Kerry won 59.03 million votes, or 48.3 percent of the popular vote; Bush won 62.04 million votes, or 50.7 percent of the popular vote. Kerry carried states with a total of 252 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]].

In the State Department, Kerry quickly earned a reputation "for being aloof, keeping to himself, and not bothering to read staff memos." Career State Department officials complained that power became too centralized under Kerry's leadership, which slowed department operations when Kerry was on frequent overseas trips. Others in State described Kerry as having "a kind of diplomatic attention deficit disorder" as he shifted from topic to topic instead of focusing on long-term strategy. When asked whether he was traveling too much, he responded, "Hell no. I'm not slowing down."

In January 2014, having met with Secretary of State, [[Archbishop]] [[Pietro Parolin]], Kerry said: "We touched on just about every major issue that we are both working on, that are issues of concern to all of us. First of all, we talked at great length about Syria, and I was particularly appreciative for the Archbishop's raising this issue, and equally grateful for the Holy Father's comments – the Pope's comments yesterday regarding his support for the Geneva II process. We welcome that support. It is very important to have broad support, and I know that the Pope is particularly concerned about the massive numbers of displaced human beings and the violence that has taken over 130,000 lives".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.state.gov/md219654.htm|title=Remarks After Meeting With Secretary of State of the Holy See Pietro Parolin|work=state.gov|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203112534/http://m.state.gov/md219654.htm|archive-date=February 3, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Syria===
Following the August 21, 2013, [[Ghouta chemical attack|chemical weapons attack on the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus]] attributed to Syrian government forces, Kerry became a leading advocate for the use of military force against the Syrian government for what he called "a despot's brutal and flagrant use of chemical weapons."<ref>{{cite news |date=August 30, 2013 |title=Kerry Becomes Chief Advocate for U.S. Attack |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/31/world/middleeast/john-kerry-syria.html |newspaper=The New York Times |first1=Peter |last1=Baker |first2=Michael R. |last2=Gordon |access-date=February 9, 2017 |archive-date=April 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409001833/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/31/world/middleeast/john-kerry-syria.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Kerry said on September 9 in response to a reporter's question about whether Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] could avert a military strike: "He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week. Turn it over, all of it, without delay, and allow a full and total accounting for that. But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously." This unscripted remark initiated a process that would lead to Syria agreeing to relinquish and destroy its chemical weapons arsenal, as Russia treated Kerry's statement as a serious proposal. Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] said Russia would work "immediately" to convince Syria relinquish and destroy its large chemical weapons arsenal.<ref>{{cite news |date=September 10, 2013 |title=Syria timeline: how Kerry's gaffe became a plan |url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/syria-timeline-how-kerrys-gaffe-became-a-plan-20130910-2ti4z.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=February 19, 2020 |archive-date=August 2, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802183556/https://www.smh.com.au/world/syria-timeline-how-kerrys-gaffe-became-a-plan-20130910-2ti4z.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=September 9, 2013 |title=John Kerry's Gaffe Heard Round the World |url=http://www.thewire.com/politics/2013/09/gaffe-heard-round-world/69205/ |newspaper=The Wire |access-date=December 19, 2013 |archive-date=December 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219090402/http://www.thewire.com/politics/2013/09/gaffe-heard-round-world/69205/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=September 9, 2013 |title=Kerry's Syria 'gaffe' gains swift traction |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ias_Ba-6bNuttPmPTTgcVZp1BUhw?docId=CNG.57b1e73f97bfc9c11ac2f3f75999a7f9.4e1 |agency=AFP |access-date=November 11, 2016 |archive-date=March 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303192936/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ias_Ba-6bNuttPmPTTgcVZp1BUhw?docId=CNG.57b1e73f97bfc9c11ac2f3f75999a7f9.4e1 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=September 9, 2013 |title=White House's Syria gaffe offers Obama a chance to climb back from war |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/09/white-house-syria-gaffe-obama-war |agency=The Guardian |access-date=December 14, 2016 |archive-date=February 14, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214202705/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/09/white-house-syria-gaffe-obama-war |url-status=live }}</ref> Syria quickly welcomed this proposal and on September 14, the UN formally accepted Syria's application to join the convention banning chemical weapons, and separately, the U.S. and Russia agreed on a plan to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons by the middle of 2014, leading Kerry to declare on July 20, 2014: "we struck a deal where we got 100 percent of the chemical weapons out."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/john-kerry-syria-archive/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 7, 2017 |archive-date=September 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901233935/http://www.politifact.com/john-kerry-syria-archive/ |url-status=live }}</ref> On September 28, the UN Security Council passed a resolution ordering the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons and condemning the August 21 Ghouta attack.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 6, 2013 |title=Timeline of events leading up to Syria chemical disarmament |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/131006/timeline-events-leading-syria-chemical-disarmament |agency=AFP |access-date=December 19, 2013 |archive-date=December 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220010648/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/131006/timeline-events-leading-syria-chemical-disarmament |url-status=live }}</ref>

In a speech before the [[Organization of American States]] in November 2013, Kerry remarked that the era of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] was over. He went on to explain, "The relationship that we seek and that we have worked hard to foster is not about a United States declaration about how and when it will intervene in the affairs of other American states. It's about all of our countries viewing one another as equals, sharing responsibilities, cooperating on security issues, and adhering not to doctrine, but to the decisions that we make as partners to advance the values and the interests that we share."<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Keith|title=Kerry Makes It Official: 'Era of Monroe Doctrine Is Over'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/11/18/kerry-makes-it-official-era-of-monroe-doctrine-is-over/|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=November 18, 2013|access-date=August 4, 2017|archive-date=July 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709071816/https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/11/18/kerry-makes-it-official-era-of-monroe-doctrine-is-over/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Marriages and children===
[[File:Secretary Kerry is Congratulated by his Family.jpg|thumb|Kerry's daughter Vanessa and grandson Alexander]]
Kerry was married to [[Julia Thorne]] in 1970, and they had two daughters together: documentary filmmaker [[Alexandra Kerry]] (born September 5, 1973) and physician [[Vanessa Kerry]] (born December 31, 1976).

Alexandra was born days before Kerry began law school.

"After 14 years as a political wife, I associated politics only with anger, fear and loneliness" she wrote in ''A Change of Heart'', her book about depression. Thorne later married Richard Charlesworth, an [[architect]], and moved to [[Bozeman, Montana]], where she became active in local environmental groups such as the [[Greater Yellowstone Coalition]]. Thorne supported Kerry's 2004 presidential run. She died of cancer on April 27, 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/04/28/julia_thorne_author_and_ex_wife_of_sen_kerry_dead_at_61/|title=Julia Thorne, author and ex-wife of Sen.

Kerry and his second wife--[[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambican]]-born businesswoman and philanthropist [[Teresa Heinz]], the widow of Kerry's late Pennsylvania Republican Senate colleague [[John Heinz]]—were introduced to each other by Heinz at an [[Earth Day]] rally in 1990. Early the following year, Senator Heinz was killed in a plane crash near [[Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Merion]]. Teresa has three sons from her marriage to Heinz, Henry John IV, [[André Heinz|André]], and [[Christopher Heinz|Christopher]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-05-23-heinz-kerry-cover_x.htm|title=With Teresa, expect an unconventional campaign|work=usatoday.com|first1=Jill|last1=Lawrence|date=May 26, 2004|access-date=March 1, 2015|archive-date=March 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329011719/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-05-23-heinz-kerry-cover_x.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Heinz and Kerry were married on May 26, 1995, in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/nation/20020605teresanat1p1.asp|title=What Teresa Heinz found and what she lost|work=post-gazette.com|accessdate=August 27, 2015|archive-date=August 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817074104/http://old.post-gazette.com/nation/20020605teresanat1p1.asp|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Net worth===

The ''[[Forbes 400]]'' survey estimated in 2004 that Teresa Heinz Kerry had a [[net worth]] of $750 million. However, estimates have frequently varied, ranging from around $165 million to as high as $3.2 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], according to a study in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Regardless of which figure is correct, Kerry was the wealthiest U.S. Senator while serving in the Senate. Independent of Heinz, Kerry is wealthy in his own right, and is the beneficiary of at least four trusts inherited from [[Forbes family]] relatives, including his mother, [[Rosemary Forbes Kerry]], who died in 2002. ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine (named for the [[Forbes family (publishers)|Forbes family of publishers]], unrelated to Kerry) estimated that if elected, and if Heinz family assets were included, Kerry would have been the third-richest U.S. president in history, when adjusted for [[inflation]].<ref name=Ackman102904>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Ackman |author-link=Dan Ackman |title=Kerry Would Be Third-Richest U.S. President If Elected |url=https://www.forbes.com/2004/02/13/cx_da_0213kerry.html |work=Forbes |date=October 29, 2004 |access-date=September 1, 2017 |archive-date=October 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010200047/https://www.forbes.com/2004/02/13/cx_da_0213kerry.html |url-status=live }}</ref> This assessment was based on Heinz's and Kerry's combined assets, but the couple signed a [[prenuptial agreement]] that keeps their assets separate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040823.html |title=What is George W.

In April 2017, Kerry purchased an 18-acre property on the northwest corner of [[Martha's Vineyard]] overlooking [[Vineyard Sound]] in the town of [[Chilmark, Massachusetts]].

===Religious beliefs===
[[File:Secretary Kerry Tours Chinese Automotive Factory (12538003213).jpg|thumb|Kerry touring a Chinese automobile factory in [[Beijing]]]]
Kerry is a [[Roman Catholic]], and is said to have carried a religious [[rosary]], a [[prayer book]], and a [[St. Christopher]] medal (the patron saint of travelers) when he campaigned. Discussing his faith, Kerry said: "I thought of being a priest. I was very religious while at school in [[Switzerland]]. I was an altar boy and prayed all the time. I was very centered around the Mass and the church." He also said that the [[Pauline epistles|Letters of Paul]] ([[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]]) moved him the most, stating that they taught him to "not feel sorry for myself."<ref name=ReligionBackground/>

Kerry told ''[[Christianity Today]]'' in October 2004:

{{quote|text=I'm a Catholic and I practice, but at the same time I have an open-mindedness to many other expressions of spirituality that come through different religions ... I've spent some time reading and thinking about religion and trying to study it, and I've arrived at not so much a sense of the differences, but a sense of the similarities in so many ways.<ref name="ctoday"/>}}
