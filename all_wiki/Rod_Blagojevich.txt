'''Rod Blagojevich''' ({{IPAc-en|b|l|ə|ˈ|ɡ|ɔɪ|.|ə|v|ɪ|tʃ}} {{Respell|blə|GOY|ə|vitch}}, born December 10, 1956), often referred to by his nickname "'''Blago'''",<ref name="associated press2"/><ref name=DailySouthtown/> is an American former politician, political commentator, and convicted felon who served as the 40th [[Governor of Illinois]] from 2003 to his 2009 impeachment following charges of public corruption for which he was later sentenced to federal prison. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Blagojevich previously worked in both the state and federal legislatures. He served as a congressman for [[Illinois]] from 1997 to 2003 and an [[Illinois House of Representatives|Illinois state representative]] from 1993 to 1997. 

Born and raised in [[Chicago]], Blagojevich graduated from [[Northwestern University]] in 1979 and the [[Pepperdine University School of Law]] in 1983. After graduating, he became a criminal prosecutor at the [[Cook County State's Attorney|Cook County State's Attorney Office]] during the late 1980s. Turning to elective politics, he represented the 33rd state house district in the Illinois House of Representatives where he passed mostly [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] policies. Foregoing a second term in the state legislature, he represented {{ushr|Illinois|5}} for six years, winning re-election twice. He was [[2002 Illinois gubernatorial election|elected Illinois governor in 2003]], the first Democrat to win the office [[List of governors of Illinois#Governors|since 1973]]. His first term saw to increased public education funding, infrastructure development, and criminal justice reforms.

A [[2006 Illinois gubernatorial election|2006 re-election]] and his second term led to the passage of a variety of healthcare, gun control, and anti-discrimination bills. Starting in December 2008, an [[Rod Blagojevich corruption charges|investigation and trial]] found Blagojevich guilty of public corruption after he attempted to solicit bribes to occupy the U.S. Senate seat vacated by then president-elect [[Barack Obama]]. Blagojevich was impeached in 2009, later convicted, and ultimately sentenced to 14 years in federal prison. After [[Rod Blagojevich corruption charges#Criminal Trial|an appeal]] for his release, U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] formally [[List of people granted executive clemency by Donald Trump|commuted his sentence in 2020]]; though Blagojevich was imprisoned for nearly eight years, the executive order ended his sentence six years early.<ref name="Commutation" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Trump commutes prison sentence of disgraced ex-Gov.

===State and federal legislator===
In 1992, with the backing of his influential father-in-law, Blagojevich unseated 14-year incumbent [[Myron Kulas]] in the Democratic primary for the 33rd state house district, in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], which includes part of [[North Side, Chicago#North Side|Chicago's North Side]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/80372366/?terms=Rod+Blagojevicah |title=(unknown) |date=November 4, 1992 |page=5 |newspaper=Herald and Review |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> As is the case with most state legislative elections in Chicago, this [[tantamount to election|virtually assured him of election]] in November.<ref name="chicago mag"/><ref name="ap patti mell">{{cite news |first=Don |last=Babwin |title=Arrest of Ill. governor puts spotlight on his wife |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008492395_apillinoisgovernorwife.html |agency=Associated Press |date=December 10, 2008 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=October 19, 2010}}</ref><ref>'Illinois Blue Book 1995-1996,' Biographical Sketch of Rod R. Blagojevech, pg. 82</ref> He drew on his experiences as a prosecutor to draft bills that he argued would strengthen the state's judicial system and reduce crime.

In 1996, Blagojevich did not seek reelection to the statehouse but instead ran for {{ushr|Illinois|5}}, based on the North Side. The district had long been represented by [[Dan Rostenkowski]], who served as chairman of the [[House Ways and Means Committee]]. Rostenkowski lost reelection in 1994 to Republican [[Michael Patrick Flanagan]] after pleading guilty to mail fraud. However, Flanagan was a conservative Republican representing a heavily Democratic district and was regarded as a heavy underdog. Blagojevich soundly defeated Flanagan by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, with support from his father-in-law. He was elected two more times, taking 74% against a nominal Republican challenger in 1998 and having only a [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] opponent in 2000.

Blagojevich was not known as a particularly active congressman. In the late 1990s, he traveled with [[Jesse Jackson]] to [[Belgrade]] in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to negotiate with President [[Slobodan Milošević]] for the release of American prisoners of war.<ref name="chicago mag"/>

On October 10, 2002, Blagojevich was one of 81 House Democrats, and one of only two from Illinois (the other being [[David D. Phelps]]), who [[Iraq Resolution|voted]] in favor of authorizing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2002/roll455.xml Final Vote Results for Roll Call 455], House Joint Resolution 114, October 10, 2002,</ref>

After the 2002 elections, Democrats had control of the Illinois House, Senate, and all but one statewide office. While in office, Blagojevich signed [[progressivism|progressive]] legislation such as ethics reform, [[death penalty]] reform, a state [[Earned Income Tax Credit]], a statewide comprehensive smoking ban and expansions of health programs like KidCare and FamilyCare (FamilyCare was ruled unconstitutional).<ref name="chicagotribune11"/> Blagojevich signed a bill in 2005 that prohibited discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]] in employment, housing, public accommodations, and credit. Blagojevich originally campaigned against [[pork barrel spending]], but eventually used it himself to gain more votes for bills.<ref name="chicagotribune11"/>

Soon after taking office in 2003, Blagojevich continued support of a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on [[death penalty|executions]] of [[death row]] inmates, even though no such executions are likely to occur for years (his predecessor, [[George Ryan]], [[commutation (law)|commuted]] all of the death sentences in the state shortly before leaving office in 2003).<ref>[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=6&did=483 Outline of Death Penalty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009225709/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=6&did=483 |date=October 9, 2006 }} moratorium and reform in Illinois.</ref> This support continued through his administration.<ref>[http://www.icadp.org/page297.html Reprint of] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010051820/http://www.icadp.org/page297.html |date=October 10, 2006 }} ''Chicago Defender'' at the Illinois Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty website.</ref>

Another notable action of his term was a strict new ethics law. When campaigning for re-election in 2006, Blagojevich said that if his ethics law had existed when former governor George Ryan had been in office, Ryan's corruption might not have occurred.<ref name="scoundrels"/> Blagojevich also signed a comprehensive death penalty reform bill that was written by then-Senator Barack Obama and the late U.S. Senator [[Paul M.

===Education===
Blagojevich oversaw record increases in funding for education every year without raising general sales or income taxes. He was criticized by Republicans and many moderate Democrats for using funds from the state pension system in order to fund other spending.<ref name="chicago mag"/> Another early 2006 proposal included "PreSchool for All" for all three- and four-year-old children in Illinois. Legislation authorizing the program was adopted as part of the fiscal year 2007 budget.<ref>[http://www.earlylearningillinois.org/ Website for] Early Learning Illinois</ref>

===Proposed capital programs===
On January 10, 2006, Blagojevich announced a proposal for a new $3 billion (US) spending plan for Illinois roads, mass transit, and schools, to be paid for by increased tax revenue and new gambling proposals (such as [[Keno]] and lottery games).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-060110blago,1,5817650.story?coll=chi-news-hed |title=Chicago Tribune article on Keno proposals |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=June 4, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The proposal met with immediate opposition by members of the Republican Party of Illinois and many Democrats, who viewed it as "an election year ploy".

In March 2008, Blagojevich announced a bipartisan coalition, chaired by former U.S. Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] and Former U.S. Congressman [[Glenn Poshard]], to develop a capital construction plan that could pass the Illinois General Assembly. The Illinois Works Coalition toured the state and developed a compromise $34 billion package that relied on a lease of the Illinois Lottery, road funds, and expanded gambling for funding.<ref>{{cite web |title=Illinois Works Coalition Update 09/03/08 |url=http://www.illinoisworkscoalition.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014193315/http://www.illinoisworkscoalition.com/ |archivedate=October 14, 2008}}</ref> The plan passed the Senate but stalled in the Illinois House, with opposition from Democrats.<ref name="chicago tribune4"/>

===Special sessions===
Blagojevich called the Illinois General Assembly into special session 36 times while in office, which is half of the total number of special sessions called since 1970.<ref name="chicago mag"/> The sessions were blamed for disrupting lawmakers' time off, while Blagojevich himself did not attend the sessions.<ref name="ap121408"/>

===Relationships with fellow lawmakers===
Blagojevich disagreed with many state Democrats while in office, with House and Senate Republican leaders [[Frank Watson (American politician)|Frank Watson]] and [[Tom Cross (politician)|Tom Cross]] often refereeing among the Democrats.<ref name="chicago mag"/> During 2008, Blagojevich even expressed fear that House Democrats would gain more seats and he would face more opposition.<ref name="southtown star">{{cite news|last=Miller |first=Rich |title=Blagojevich helps constitutional convention call with his 'vote no' comments |website=[[Southtown Star]] |date=November 4, 2008 |url=http://www.southtownstar.com/news/miller/1257928,110408miller.article |accessdate=November 10, 2008 }}{{dead link |date=March 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Blagojevich was often at odds with members of both parties in the state legislature. Democratic legislator [[Jack D. Franks|Jack Franks]] said that the reason Blagojevich had problems passing laws with the cooperation of the General Assembly is that he did not spend enough time with the legislature. "That's a real reason he has such poor relations with the Legislature and can't get any of his agenda passed, because he doesn't talk to anybody."<ref name="apfranks">{{cite news |url= http://www.danrutherford.com/6212007Dailyherald.asp|title= Eight trips = $76,000|agency= Associated Press|date= June 21, 2007|publisher= Dan Rutherford official campaign site}}</ref> When lawmakers working on a budget during a special session met at 10&nbsp;am rather than 2&nbsp;pm, and Blagojevich's attorney threatened that the Governor was considering legal action against the involved representatives, Democratic Rep.

Blagojevich has also disagreed publicly with then-Democratic Chicago Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]]; after their dispute over [[Chicago Transit Authority]] funding, Daley called Blagojevich "cuckoo" and said he did not want to argue with the Governor since "He's arguing with everybody in America."<ref name="chicago tribune5">{{cite news |first=Monique |last=Garcia |title=Blagojevich: 'I don't think I'm cuckoo' |url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2008/09/blagojevich-i-d.html |work=Chicago Tribune |date=September 15, 2008 |accessdate=November 8, 2008}}</ref> Blagojevich replied, "I don't think I'm cuckoo."<ref name="chicago tribune5"/>

Soon after a meeting of 2007 with Democratic State Senator [[Mike Jacobs (IL)|Mike Jacobs]], meant to convince Jacobs to vote for Blagojevich's health insurance proposals, Jacobs emerged telling reporters that the Governor "blew up at him like a 10-year-old child", Blagojevich would not comment on the alleged incident.<ref name="ap072007"/> Jacobs said during 2008: "This is a governor who I don't think has a single ally, except for Senate president [[Emil Jones]]&nbsp;— and that's tenuous at best." Jones and Blagojevich sometimes collaborated, while at other times they disagreed on funding for education.<ref name="chicago mag"/>

During a 2008 Congressional race pitting Democratic state senator [[Debbie Halvorson]] against Republican Marty Ozinga, the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] ran television advertisements attempting to help Halvorson by linking Republican Ozinga to Blagojevich, asserting that Ozinga had given campaign donations to the Democratic governor.<ref name="chicago tribune8">{{cite news |title=Exploiting the Rod curse |work=Chicago Tribune |date=October 28, 2008 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-10-28/news/0810270371_1_rod-blagojevich-democratic-party-democratic-congressional-campaign-committee |accessdate=November 8, 2008}}</ref>

===''The Daily Show'' appearances===
During early February 2006, Blagojevich appeared on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' to discuss his executive order that pharmacists must dispense any drugs for which a customer had a valid prescription, including [[birth control pill]]s and [[Levonorgestrel|Plan B]]. This measure was being challenged on the show by state legislator [[Ron Stephens (Illinois politician)|Ron Stephens]] from [[Greenville, Illinois]]. Blagojevich was interviewed by [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]], who repeatedly pretended to be unable to pronounce Blagojevich's name and simply called him "Governor Smith". At one point in the interview, Jones, who was acting as if he were against the governor's order, told him, "I'll be in charge of what my listeners hear." This prompted Blagojevich to turn to the camera and ask, "Is he teasing me or is that legit?" Two weeks after the interview, Blagojevich said that he was unaware of the nature of the show.<ref name="apdailyshow">{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Davis |title=Ill. governor confused by 'Daily Show' bit |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-02-23-governor_x.htm |agency=Associated Press |work=USA Today |date=February 23, 2006 |accessdate=July 17, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=115852&title=Pill-of-Rights |title=Pill of Rights |work=The Daily Show |date=February 9, 2006}}</ref> Stephens said he knew beforehand that the show was a comedy show: "I thought the governor was hip enough that he would have known that, too."<ref name="apdailyshow"/>

Stephens later said, "With all due respect to the governor, he knew it was a comedy show. It's general knowledge for people under 90 years of age. It was when he came off looking so silly that he said he thought it was a regular news program.

Blagojevich made another appearance on ''The Daily Show'' on August 23, 2010, after his removal from office. During his time on the show, he vehemently defended himself against host [[Jon Stewart]]'s critique of things that he had previously said on the show. Stewart focused on how Blagojevich had expressed a great desire to tell his side in court, but then did not. Stewart attempted to get a promise that next time, Blagojevich would testify. Stewart also focused on Blagojevich's previous statement to him, that if one heard the famous "effing golden" statement in context, it would be seen as innocent. Stewart played the additional recording, and asked him how that sounded any different. The former governor had no concrete answers.<ref>Time/CNN Rod Blagojevich and Jon Stewart Interview, [http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2010/08/24/the-rod-blagojevich-jon-stewart-interview-truly-haunting-tv/], [http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-august-23-2010/rod-blagojevich The Daily Show Interview]</ref>

==Political positions==
===State spending===
Blagojevich was criticized for using what his opponents called "gimmicks" to balance the state budget. Republicans claimed that he was simply passing the state's fiscal problems on to future generations by borrowing his way to balanced budgets. Indeed, the 2005 state budget called for paying the bills by underfunding a state employees' pension fund by $1.2 billion.<ref name="chicago mag"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.uiuc.edu/ii/05/1020/suaa.html |title=New Illinois law affects SURS retirement benefits |work=News.uiuc.edu |accessdate=June 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012155815/http://www.news.uiuc.edu/ii/05/1020/suaa.html |archive-date=October 12, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

===Gun control===
Blagojevich has been described as a "staunch" supporter of gun control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-05-14/news/0005140200_1_gun-control-gun-show-background-checks-gun-control-showdown|title=In Gun-control Showdown, Some Are Slow To Pull Trigger|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>

During his February 2006 "State of the State" address, Blagojevich said the state should ban semi-automatic firearms.

As a state legislator, Blagojevich proposed raising the price of an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card from $5 to $500.
Blagojevich vetoed three gun bills in 2005, which would have:
# Deleted records in gun database after 90 days

===Oprah Winfrey===
In early 2009, Blagojevich reported being so impressed by [[Oprah Winfrey's endorsement of Barack Obama|Oprah Winfrey's influence on the election of Barack Obama]] that he considered offering Obama's vacant Senate seat to Winfrey. Blagojevich summarized his reasons for considering Winfrey on various talk shows:

{{quote|To begin with, she was perhaps the most instrumental person in electing Barack Obama president. She is a larger-than-life figure in America and around the world. She has a huge bully pulpit and tremendous support across America ... She has a voice larger than all 100 senators combined. And if she was a U.S. Senator, she would be a voice for the Obama program, which she supports, and she would be in a position to be able to use an unbelievable bully pulpit to be able to get it done. She obviously can't be bought. And she's actually a very, obviously, in my judgment, a very impressive and a very nice person.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,485046,00.html |title=Part 2 of Gov.

Winfrey noted that although she was uninterested, she did feel she could be a senator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbbm780.com/Oprah--Absolutely-Not--Interested-In-Senate-Seat/3726315 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20090211055831/http://www.wbbm780.com/Oprah--Absolutely-Not--Interested-In-Senate-Seat/3726315 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 11, 2009 |title=Oprah 'Absolutely Not' Interested In Senate Seat |publisher=[[WBBM (AM)|WBBM 780]] |date=January 26, 2009 |accessdate=January 31, 2009}}</ref>

Political analyst [[Chris Matthews]] praised Blagojevich's idea of making Winfrey a senator, suggesting that in one move it would diversify the Senate and raise its collective [[IQ]]. Elaborating further he said:

{{quote|Anybody who doesn't think Winfrey would be a great senator from Illinois or anywhere is crazy. She gets along with everybody. She brings people together. She finds common ground. She's way past race politics 20 years ago. She's so far ahead of most people in human relations. And she listens ... I think she is up there with [[Will Rogers]] and [[Bob Hope]] and some of our great public personalities of the last century.}}

[[Lynn Sweet]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' agreed with Matthews, writing Winfrey would be "terrific" and an "enormously popular pick".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28899478 |title='Hardball with Chris Matthews' for Monday, January 26 |publisher=NBC News |date=January 26, 2009 |accessdate=January 31, 2009}}</ref>

===Post-removal activities===
After being convicted and removed from office by the [[Illinois Senate]], Blagojevich went on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', where he re-affirmed his innocence and stated that the Illinois legislature's decision to remove him from office was politically motivated due to his unwillingness to raise taxes. He has accused his successor, [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]], of using state funds excessively for personal leisure.

Blagojevich attempted to make a deal to star in [[NBC]]'s 2009 summer [[reality show]] ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (American season 2)|I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me out of Here!]]''. He made a request with the judge to ease his travel restrictions so that he could travel to [[Costa Rica]] to star in the show, saying that his family needed to make money. However, his request was formally rejected by U.S. District Judge [[James B. Zagel]], who was sympathetic to Blagojevich's financial situation, but nevertheless stated, "I don't think this defendant fully understands and I don't think he could understand ... the position he finds himself in."

===Appeal===
Blagojevich appealed his conviction, claiming judicial bias and a tainted jury pool. He has also long contended that there was critical evidence the jury never heard, including witness testimony and recorded phone calls that Judge Zagel did not allow to be played during the trial. They have also argued that Blagojevich's own testimony was restricted by Judge Zagel's rulings.<ref>{{cite news|first=Annie|last=Sweeney|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-12-09/news/ct-met-blagojevich-appeal-20111209_1_blagojevich-attorneys-appeals-court-7th-circuit-court |title=Blagojevich attorneys consider prison and appeal|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=December 9, 2011}}</ref>

In August 2016, a resentencing hearing was held in the district court. Judge Zagel re-imposed the same 14-year sentence he had imposed in 2011.

Illinois House GOP leader Jim Durkin criticized the President's decision to commute Blagojevich's sentence, stating that Blagojevich was "rogue on steroids" when he "abused the office" and that Trump was "not concerned about the people of Illinois in November."<ref>https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/483489-gop-illinois-house-leader-slams-trump-for-commuting-blagojevichs</ref> The commutation was satirized by Chicago-based [[The Wieners Circle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicagos-rudest-hot-dog-stand-the-wieners-circle-sends-message-to-blagojevich/2224092/|title=Chicago's Rudest Hot Dog Stand, The Wiener's Circle, Sends Message to Blagojevich|website=NBC Chicago|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> Following the commutation, the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission found that Blagojevich engaged in "a pattern of dishonest and deceptive conduct" and recommended his disbarment to the Illinois Supreme Court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/illinois-disciplinary-panel-recommends-rod-blagojevich-be-disbarred|title=Illinois disciplinary panel recommends Rod Blagojevich be disbarred|last=Journal|first=A.

In August of the same year, it was announced that Blagojevich would be the featured speaker at a fundraising event to benefit Republican state senate candidate Tom McCullagh.
