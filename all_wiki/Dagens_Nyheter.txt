==Location==
''Dagens Nyheter'' operates from the so-called "DN-skrapan" (the DN skyscraper or [[Dagens Nyheter Tower]]) in Stockholm.

In 1996, the entire enterprise moved to its current location on Gjörwellsgatan, which is adjacent to the old tower.<ref>Historia [https://web.archive.org/web/20171001095048/http://info.dn.se/info/om-oss/historia/].</ref> The newspaper ''[[Expressen]]'', also owned by the Bonnier Group,<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert G.
