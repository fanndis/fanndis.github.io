'''Welfare reforms''' are changes in the operation of a given [[Welfare|welfare system]], with the goals of reducing the number of individuals dependent on government assistance, keeping the welfare systems affordable, and assisting recipients to become self-sufficient. [[Classical liberalism|Classical liberals]] and [[Conservatism|conservatives]] generally argue that welfare and other tax-funded services reduce incentives to work, exacerbate the [[free-rider problem]], and intensify poverty. On the other hand, [[Socialism|socialists]] generally [[Criticism of capitalism|criticize welfare reform]] because it usually minimizes the public [[Social safety net|safety net]] and strengthens the capitalist economic system. Welfare reform is constantly debated because of the varying opinions on the government's determined balance of providing guaranteed welfare benefits and promoting self-sufficiency.

== Overview == 
Within the last two decades, welfare systems have been under extreme scrutiny around the world. Demographic changes like the post-war "baby boom" followed by the subsequent "baby bust", coupled with economic shifts such as the 1970 oil shocks, led to aging populations and a dwindling working force. In turn, there became an increased dependency on social welfare systems, which inevitably brought up the issue of welfare reform. U.S systems primarily focused on reducing poor single-parents need for welfare, through employment incentives. The U.K focused primarily on reducing general unemployment through the New Deal. The Netherlands emphasized reforming disability programs, and Latin America focused primarily on pension reforms.

German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was one political leader who attempted to put an end to socialism by proposing government healthcare. He approved the 1883 Health Insurance Act which was the first to introduce compulsory government-monitored health insurance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ottob.html|title=Social Security History|website=www.ssa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-16}}</ref> The German legislation ensured contributory retirement and disability benefits. Participation became mandatory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/112.htm|title=Germany - Social Insurance and Welfare Programs|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2018-06-16}}</ref> Many historians trace the beginnings of contemporary welfare in Europe and America to Bismarck's Health Insurance law. However, this welfare program intended for the working class was practiced by the Roman Empire, China's Song Dynasty, and the 7th Century Islamic System.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/bismarck-tried-end-socialisms-grip-offering-government-healthcare-180964064/|title=Bismarck Tried to End Socialism's Grip—By Offering Government Healthcare|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}</ref> In the United States, the Great Depression and 1929 crash of the stock market contributed significantly to the formation of the concept of welfare as many Americans struggled economically during those times.

In 1964, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] introduced a series of legislation known as the [[War on poverty|War on Poverty]] in response to a persistently high poverty rate around 20%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Lyndon_Johnson_Welfare_+_Poverty.htm|title=Lyndon Johnson on Welfare & Poverty|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=2018-06-16}}</ref> He funded welfare programs such as [[Social Security Act|Social Security]], [[Food Stamps]], [[Job Corps]], and [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/08/war-on-poverty-more-than-feeding-poor|title=President Johnson's war on poverty was about more than feeding and housing the poor {{!}} Ana Marie Cox|last=Cox|first=Ana Marie|date=2014-01-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-16}}</ref> The War on Poverty included new federal programs such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]], which provided seniors, low-income individuals, and other disadvantaged groups with health insurance coverage.

President [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration proposed the 1969 Family Assistance Plan,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nixonfoundation.org/2014/06/family-assistance-plan-families-can-succeed/|title=#FamiliesSucceed: President Nixon's Family Assistance Plan » Richard Nixon Foundation|date=2014-06-23|work=Richard Nixon Foundation|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref> which instituted a work requirement for all welfare recipients except mothers with children under age three. This requirement was removed in 1972 amidst criticism from liberals that the plan provided too little support and having excessively stringent work requirements. Ultimately, the Nixon Administration presided over the continued expansion of major welfare programs.

In 1981, President [[Ronald Reagan]] cut [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)]] spending<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Social Welfare Under Reagan|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1984030900|journal=CQ Researcher by CQ Press|language=en|issn=1942-5635}}</ref> and allowed states to require welfare recipients to participate in workfare programs. [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray's]] book [[Losing Ground (book)|Losing Ground]]: American Social Policy, 1950–1980 (1984) argued that the [[welfare state]] actually harms the poor, especially single-parent families, by making them increasingly dependent on the government, and discouraging them from working.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/11/us/q-a-charles-murray-of-babies-and-stick.html|title=Q&A: Charles Murray; Of Babies And Stick|last=Times|first=Robert Pear and Special To the New York|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}</ref> Murray proposed that current welfare programs be replaced by short-term local programs.<ref>"Welfare."

In his [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|1992 campaign]], [[Bill Clinton]] promised to “end welfare as we have come to know it.” Staying true to his promise, he instated one of the most well-known welfare reforms in U.S. history.<ref>[Clinton, Bill (October 23, 1991). "The New Covenant: Responsibility and Rebuilding the American Community. Remarks to Students at Georgetown University".Democratic Leadership Council. Retrieved 2018-03-08.]</ref> On August 22, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act]] of 1996 (PRWORA), which aligned closely with Murray's views.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/news/clinton-1990s-welfare-reform-facts|title=How Bill Clinton's Welfare Reform Changed America|work=HISTORY|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}</ref> PRWORA instituted the [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] program (TANF) to replace the AFDC, the welfare program which had provided cash to poor families since 1935. TANF instated [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families|work restrictions]] for recipients to qualify for aid. TANF also shifted welfare spending to state governments. Each state was allotted a sum of money to be used for the program, provided that they instituted work requirements and allowed families to stay on the program for a maximum of five-years.<ref>[Schott, Liz. 2011. Policy Basics: An Introduction to TANF. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Accessed 03/07/2018 from http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=936]</ref> 

Since then, other welfare programs have transitioned to the shared model established by TANF. The Federal Government gives money to the states in the form of [[Block grant (United States)|block grants]], which allows states to make decisions on how to allocate welfare.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/welfare-reform-in-the-united-states-3321425|title=Welfare Reform in the United States|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-06-16}}</ref>

Beginning in the mid-1970s, a deficit in the social insurance program began to appear. The deficit saw peaks at 27.75% of the social insurance budget in 1992. This led to a major push by the government to cut back spending in the welfare program. By the end of the 1990s the deficit had been almost completely eradicated. The often large deficits that the program has endured has led to a tremendous amount of opposition to the program as it stands.

In February 2020, a pension overhaul was adopted by decree using [[Article 49 of the French constitution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e83c5d6e-5b31-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4|title=French government adopts pension reform by decree|accessdate=29 February 2020|publisher=Financial Times}}</ref>

=== Brazil ===
During the [[2015–2018 Brazilian economic crisis]], there has been both economic and political turmoil. President [[Dilma Rousseff]], who was later impeached and replaced by President [[Michel Temer]], strived to expand the social welfare program [[Bolsa Família]] instated by her predecessor [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. As a social-democrat, Rousseff pledged that "Brazil will continue to grow, with social inclusion and mobility."<ref>AFP. "Nos EUA, Dilma se manifesta contra privatização de empresas do setor elétrico e da Petrobras". Zero Hora. 6 March 2018.</ref> When Michel Temer took office, to cope with the severe economic recession, he proposed social welfare reforms to change labor rules and the social security pension system. Temer's plan included limiting pension benefits and raising the retirement age in order to save money and fix the economy. Additionally, under his reform, companies have greater power to require longer work days and use part-time workers. In response to this reform, labor unions, rural workers, and government employees held protests all over Brazil.<ref>Voa. “Brazilians Protest against President's Reform Plan.” VOA, VOA, 17 Mar. 2017, learningenglish.voanews.com/a/brazilians-protest-against-presidents-reform-plan/3769485.html.</ref> The vote to approve the pension reform was first suspended until February 2018, and now has been further postponed as a campaign issue in this year's election. Temer's critics believe that the reason for the postponed reform is its vast public disapproval.<ref>Boadle, Anthony (19 February 2018).
