It is the [[administrative centre]] of [[Perth and Kinross]] [[council area]] and the historic [[county town]] of [[Perthshire]]. It had a population of about 47,180 in 2012.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url = http://gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/theme/population/estimates/special-area/settlements-localities/mid-2012/list-of-tables.html|title = Mid-2012 Populations Estimates for Settlements and Localities in Scotland|access-date = 28 November 2014|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141027170905/http://gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/theme/population/estimates/special-area/settlements-localities/mid-2012/list-of-tables.html|archive-date = 27 October 2014|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Perth has been known as ''The Fair City'' since the publication of the story ''[[Fair Maid of Perth]]'' by Scottish writer [[Sir Walter Scott]] in 1828. During the later medieval period the city was also called ''St John's Toun'' or ''Saint Johnstoun'' by its inhabitants in reference to the main church dedicated to St [[John the Baptist]]. This name is preserved by the city's football club, [[St Johnstone F.C.]]

There has been a settlement at Perth since [[prehistoric]] times, on a natural mound raised slightly above the flood plain of the [[River Tay|Tay]], where the river could be crossed at low tide. The area surrounding the modern city is known to have been occupied since [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s arrived more than 8,000 years ago. Nearby [[Neolithic]] standing stones and circles also exist, dating from about 4000 BC, following the introduction of farming in the area.

The presence of [[Scone Abbey]], home of the [[Stone of Scone]] (also known as the Stone of Destiny) where the [[King of Scots]] was crowned, enhanced the early importance of the city. Perth became known as a 'capital' of Scotland, due to the frequent residence of the royal court. [[Royal Burgh]] status was soon given to the city by King [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]] in the early 12th century. The city became one of the richest burghs in the country, doing trade with France, the [[Low Countries]] and [[Baltic Countries]] for goods such as Spanish silk and French wine. The [[Scottish Reformation]] also played a big role in the city with the sacking of the Houses of the Greyfriars and [[Blackfriars, Perth|Blackfriars]], after a sermon given by [[John Knox]] in St John's Kirk in 1559. The [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] later brought about [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] uprisings. The city was occupied by Jacobite supporters on three occasions (1689, 1715 and 1745). The founding of [[Perth Academy]] in 1760 helped to bring major industries, such as [[linen]], [[leather]], [[bleach]] and [[whisky]], to the city. Given its location, Perth was perfectly placed to become a key transport centre with the coming of the [[railway]]s, and its first station was built in 1848.

Today, Perth serves as a retail centre for the surrounding area. The city has a thriving culinary scene and is known for its great selection of restaurants and eateries, having been awarded the title of [https://www.perthcity.co.uk/scotlands-food-town/ 'Scotland's Food Town of 2018'] by the Scottish Food Awards. Following the decline of the [[whisky]] industry locally and building upon its long established presence in the [[insurance]] sector, the city's economy has now diversified to include [[banking]]. 
Due to its location, the city is often referred to as the "Gateway to the Highlands".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g186565-i35930887-Perth_Perth_and_Kinross_Scotland.html |title=Perth – gateway to the highlands – Picture of Perth, Perth and Kinross |publisher=TripAdvisor |date=25 September 2011 |access-date=2 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225115/http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g186565-i35930887-Perth_Perth_and_Kinross_Scotland.html |archive-date=4 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In Australia, [[Perth|Perth in Western Australia]], and [[Perth, Tasmania]] as well as  [[Perth, Ontario|Perth in Canada]] are named after Perth in Scotland. Perth is twinned with [[Aschaffenburg]] in the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Bavaria]].

The name ''Perth'' derives from a [[Pictish language|Pictish]] word for ''wood'' or ''copse''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mills |first1=David |title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names |date=20 Oct 2011 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-960908-6 |page=366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXucAQAAQBAJ |access-date=22 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022153303/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tXucAQAAQBAJ&dq |archive-date=22 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> During much of the later medieval period it was known colloquially by its Scots-speaking inhabitants as "St John's Toun" or "Saint Johnstoun" because the church at the centre of the parish was dedicated to St [[John the Baptist]].<ref name="Graham-Campbell pp1–2">Graham-Campbell ''Perth: The Fair City'' pp1–2</ref> Perth was referred to as "St Johns ton" up until the mid-1600s with the name "Perthia" being reserved for the wider area.<ref name="Jansson">{{Cite map |publisher=Jansson, 1659 |title=Scotiae provintiae inter Taum Fluvium, et Septentrionales oras Angliae. |url=http://maps.nls.uk/scotland/detail.cfm?id=140 |cartography=Jan Jansson |access-date=1 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523184716/http://maps.nls.uk/scotland/detail.cfm?id=140 |archive-date=23 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> At this time, "Perthia" became "Perth Shyre" and "St Johns ton" became known as Perth.<ref name="Jansson" />

Perth's Pictish name, and some archaeological evidence, indicate that there must have been a settlement here from earlier times, probably at a point where a river crossing or crossings coincided with a slightly raised natural mound on the west bank of the Tay (which at Perth flows north-south), thus giving some protection for settlement from the frequent flooding.<ref name="Graham-Campbell pp1–2"/> Finds in and around Perth show that it was occupied by the [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s who arrived in the area more than 8,000 years ago. Nearby [[Neolithic]] standing stones and circles followed the introduction of farming from about 4000 BC, and a remarkably well preserved [[Bronze Age]] [[canoe|log boat]] dated to around 1000 BC was found in the [[mudflats]] of the River Tay at Carpow to the east of Perth.

The presence of [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]] two miles (3&nbsp;km) northeast, the main royal centre of the [[Kingdom of Alba]] from at least the reign of [[Kenneth I]] mac Ailpín (843–58), later the site of the major [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] abbey of the same name founded by [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] (1107–24), enhanced Perth's early importance. Perth was considered the effective 'capital' of Scotland, due to the frequent residence of the royal court. [[Royal Burgh]] status was soon awarded to the city from [[William the Lion|King William the Lion]] in the early 12th century. During the 12th and 13th centuries, Perth was one of the richest trading burghs in the kingdom (along with such places as [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], [[Aberdeen]] and [[Roxburgh]]), residence of numerous craftsmen, organised into guilds (e.g. the Hammermen [metalworkers] or Glovers).  Perth also carried out an extensive trade with France, [[The Low Countries]] and the [[Baltic Countries]] with luxury goods being brought back in return, such as Spanish silk and French pottery and wine.<ref name="Graham-Campbell p8">Graham-Campbell ''Perth:The Fair City'' p8</ref> The royal castle (on or near the site of the present [[multi-storey car park]] adjacent to the new council offices), was destroyed by a flood of the Tay in 1209, one of many that have afflicted Perth over the centuries.<ref name="Graham-Campbell p 6">Graham-Campbell ''Perth:The Fair City'' p6</ref> It was never rebuilt and Perth was protected at this time only by partial walls and an inventive water system consisting of a [[Mill lade]] from the River Almond which divided and flowed to the North on one side and the West and South on the other, eventually joining the Tay.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Guthrie|title=Bygone Perth|year=2005|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, Ayrshire|isbn=9781840333527|pages=3–4|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=415|access-date=23 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528201110/http://stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=415|archive-date=28 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Scotia Depicta - Part of Perth from the north -Plate-.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Engraving of a view of Perth by [[James Fittler]] in Scotia Depicta, published 1804]]

King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] brought his armies to Perth in 1296 and with only a [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]] for defence and little fortification, the city fell quickly.<ref name="Graham-Campbell p14">Graham-Campbell ''Perth: The Fair City'' p14</ref> Stronger fortifications were quickly implemented by the English, and plans to wall the city took shape in 1304. They remained standing until [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]]'s recapture of Perth in 1312.<ref name="Graham-Campbell pp16–17">Graham-Campbell ''Perth: The Fair City'' pp16–17</ref> As part of a plan to make Perth a permanent English base within Scotland, [[Edward III]] forced six monasteries in [[Perthshire]] and [[Fife]] to pay for the construction of stone defensive walls, towers and fortified gates around the city in 1336. These defences were the strongest of any city in Scotland in the Middle Ages.

King [[James I of Scotland]] was assassinated in Perth in 1437, by followers of the [[Earl of Atholl]] at [[Blackfriars, Perth|Blackfriars church]].<ref>Brown, "James I (1394–1437)".</ref> Records survive from the Perth crafts of masons and carpenters, and the hammermen (metal workers), and others.

[[File:Head of John Knox.JPG|thumb|left|100px|Statue of John Knox]]
In May 1559, [[John Knox]] instigated the [[Scottish Reformation]] at grass-roots level with a sermon against 'idolatry' in the burgh kirk of St John the Baptist.<ref>{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Roderick|title=John Knox: Man of Action|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PKlV-mkYDJMC&q=Perth+St+John+the+Baptist+Knox&pg=PA144|year=2013|publisher=St Andrew Press|isbn=9780861537150|page=144|access-date=21 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821174344/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PKlV-mkYDJMC&lpg=PA144&dq=Perth%20St%20John%20the%20Baptist%20Knox&pg=PA144#v=onepage&q=Perth%20St%20John%20the%20Baptist%20Knox&f=false|archive-date=21 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> An inflamed mob quickly destroyed the altars in the kirk, and attacked the Houses of the Greyfriars and [[Blackfriars, Perth|Blackfriars]], and the [[Carthusian]] Priory. Scone Abbey was sacked shortly afterwards. The regent of infant [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], her mother [[Marie de Guise]], was successful in quelling the rioting but [[presbyterianism]] in Perth remained strong. Perth played a part in the Covenanting struggle and Perth was sacked for two days by Royalist troops after the [[Battle of Tippermuir]] in 1644.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=W.

That same year [[Oliver Cromwell]] came to Perth following his victory in the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]] and established a fortified citadel on the South Inch, one of five occupation forts built to control Scotland.<ref>[http://www.perthcity.co.uk/index.asp?pg=61 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824192418/http://www.perthcity.co.uk/index.asp?pg=61 |date=24 August 2012 }}</ref> The restoration of Charles II was not without incident, and with the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] in 1701, came the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] uprisings. The city was occupied by Jacobite soldiers in 1689, 1715 and 1745.

[[File:Rose Terrace.jpg|thumb|The Old Academy in Rose Terrace]]
In 1760, Perth Academy was founded, and major industry came to the city, now with a population of 15,000. [[Linen]], [[leather]], [[bleach]]ed products and [[whisky]] were its major exports. Given its location, Perth was perfectly placed to become a key transport centre with the coming of the [[railway]]s. The first railway station in Perth was built in 1848. Horse-drawn carriages became popular in the 1890s; they were quickly replaced by electric [[tram]]s of [[Perth Corporation Tramways]]. Despite being a garrison city and undergoing major social and industrial developments during the First World War, Perth remained relatively unchanged. In 1829, with the settlement of the Swan River Colony, in Western Australia, [[Sir George Murray]] wanted it to be named [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] after the place where he was born. The old [[Municipal Buildings, Perth|Municipal Buildings]] were completed in 1881, although the Perth and Kinross District Council moved to the former head office of [[General Accident]] at No. 2 High Street in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pkc.gov.uk/media/14401/City-Status-Bid-document/pdf/City_Status_Bid_document.pdf?m=636105872603930000|page=8|title=The Fair City of Perth: Application for City Status|publisher=Perth and Kinross Council|date=5 April 2010|access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref>

===Heraldry===
[[File:Coa Scotland Town Perth.svg|thumb|The coat of arms of Perth]]
The [[coat of arms]] of Perth is: [[Gules (heraldry)|Gules]] a [[Lamb of God|Paschal lamb]] reguardant [[Argent (heraldry)|argent]] haloed [[Or (heraldry)|or]] holding under its right foreleg a flagpole topped with a cross of the second, to which is attached a banner [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] a saltire argent, all within a [[Orle (heraldry)|tressure]] flory-counter-flory of the last. The shield is [[Supporter (heraldry)|supported]] by a [[double-headed eagle]] or, and the motto is ''PRO REGE, LEGE ET GREGE'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: For the King, the Law and the People).<ref name="heraldry">{{cite book|last=Urquhart|first=R.M.|title=Scottish Burgh and County Heraldry|publisher=Heraldry Today|place=London |date=1973 |isbn=978-0900455247 |pages=108–109}}</ref>

The coat of arms dates back to at least the 14th century, and is first recorded, as described, on a seal of 1378. Red and silver are the colours of [[John the Baptist]], the town's patron saint, and the lamb is his symbol. The double-headed eagle, originally a Roman symbol, may refer to a former Roman settlement called "[[Bertha (Perth)|Bertha]]" near where Perth now stands.<ref name="heraldry"/>

The double-headed eagle was adopted as the supporter of the arms of [[Perth and Kinross]] when that [[Subdivisions of Scotland#Council areas|council area]] was created in 1975.

==Governance==
Perth forms part of the [[United Kingdom constituencies|county constituency]] of [[Perth and North Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and North Perthshire]], electing one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the Parliament of the United Kingdom by the first past the post system.

For the purposes of the [[Scottish Parliament]], Perth forms part of the constituencies of [[Perthshire North (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Perthshire North]] and [[Perthshire South and Kinross-shire (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Perthshire South and Kinross-shire]]. These two constituencies were created in 2011 as two of the nine constituencies within the [[Mid Scotland and Fife (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Mid Scotland and Fife]] electoral region. Each constituency elects one [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) by the first past the post system of election, and the region elects seven additional members to produce a form of proportional representation.

=== City status ===
[[File:Perthsigns.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Signage in Perth using the term 'city' prior to the reinstatement of city status.]]
The classic definition of Perth has been as a city. In the late-1990s, the [[UK Government]] and the devolved [[Scottish Executive]] re-examined the definition<ref name="Scottish City Status">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/society/rsca-02.asp |title=Review of Scotland's Cities – The Analysis |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=January 2003 |access-date=14 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424174336/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/society/rsca-02.asp |archive-date=24 April 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> of a city and produced a list of approved cities, from which Perth was omitted. It was therefore considered to be a "former city", like [[Brechin]] and [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].

Yet road signs around the borders used the term "The City of Perth", and directional signs within indicated "City Centre".

===Religion===
[[File:St Ninian&#039;s Cathedral, Perth.jpg|thumb|St Ninian&#039;s Cathedral, Perth]]
[[Christianity]] is the most common religion in the city. In Census 2011, over half of the population of the council area of [[Perth and Kinross]] stated that they belonged to one of the Christian denominations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Statistical Bulletin - Religion |url=https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/documents/censusresults/release2a/StatsBulletin2A.pdf |website=Census 2011 |access-date=17 July 2020}}</ref> The most popular denomination is the [[Church of Scotland]] which is organised through the Presbytery of Perth.

==Economy==
[[File:Perth Concert Hall, Perth, Scotland.jpg|thumb|right|[[Perth Concert Hall (Scotland)|Perth Concert Hall]]]]

The strength of Perth's economy lies in its diversity, with a balance of large companies, the public sector, a broad range of small and medium-sized enterprises and many self-employed business people. The development in [[renewable energy]], [[insurance]], [[manufacturing]], [[leisure]], [[health]] and [[transport]] is stimulating employment. The largest employer in the city is Perth and Kinross Council which employ 6,000 people. Other main employers include [[NHS Tayside]], [[SSE plc]], and [[Perth College UHI]] (part of the [[University of the Highlands and Islands]]). The leading international transportation company, [[Stagecoach Group]] also has its global headquarters in the city.<ref name="Fair City19">Perth and Kinross Council, ''The Fair City of Perth – An application for City Status'', p.19.</ref>

=== Landmarks and tourism ===
[[File:(looking towards) St John's Kirk, Perth.jpg|thumb|right|St John's Kirk]]

Perth has 79 tourist attractions listed on the site [[TripAdvisor]].

The Category A listed<ref name="St John's Kirk listing">{{Historic Environment Scotland|num=LB39300 |desc=St John's Kirk, Kirkside, St John's Place, St John Street |cat=A |access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref> St John's Kirk on South St John's Place is architecturally and historically one of the most significant buildings in Perth.<ref name="Graham-Campbell pp38–39">Graham-Campbell pp38–39</ref> The settlement of the original church dates back to the mid-12th century.<ref name="Walker and Ritchie p122">Walker and Ritchie ''Fife, Perthshire and Angus'' p. 122.</ref> During the middle of the 12th century, the church was allowed to fall into disrepair, when most of the revenues were used by David I to fund [[Dunfermline Abbey]].<ref name="Graham-Campbell pp38–39" /> The majority of the present church was constructed between 1440 and 1500.<ref name="Graham-Campbell pp38–39" /> Though much altered, its tower and [[lead]]-clad spire continue to dominate the Perth skyline. The Church has lost its medieval south porch and [[sacristy]], and the north [[transept]] was shortened during the course of the 19th century during street-widening. A rare treasure, a unique survival in Scotland, is a 15th-century brass candelabrum, imported from the [[Low Countries]]. The survival of this object is all the more remarkable as it includes a statuette of the [[Virgin Mary]]. St John's Kirk also had the finest collection of post-Reformation church plate in Scotland (now housed permanently in Perth Museum and Art Gallery). Equally remarkably, the collection of medieval bells is the largest to have survived in [[Great Britain]].

The spire of Category B listed<ref name="St Paul's Church listing">{{Historic Environment Scotland|num=LB39315 |desc=South Methven Street, High Street and St Paul's Square, St Paul's Church |cat=B |fewer-links=yes |access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref> St Paul's Church, which was completed in 1807 is a major focus point around St Paul's Square at the junction of Old High Street and North Methven Street.

The nearby City Mills built to serve the [[Mill lade|lade]] from the [[River Almond, Perth and Kinross|River Almond]] was once the site of industry until the early 19th century.

== Sport and recreation ==
[[File:McDiarmid Park.jpg|thumb|right|View from the West (Main) Stand of [[McDiarmid Park]], home of [[St Johnstone F.C.]]]]
[[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] is the city's professional [[football (soccer)|football]] club. The team play in the [[Scottish Premiership]] at their home ground, [[McDiarmid Park]], in the [[Tulloch, Perth and Kinross|Tulloch]] area of the city. They won the [[Scottish Cup]] for the first time in 2014, after 130 years without a major trophy.<ref name="St Johnstone Football Club">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/default.stm |title=Clubs in the Scottish Premier League |work=BBC Sport |date=19 January 2011 |access-date=19 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513012621/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/default.stm |archive-date=13 May 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> There are also two [[East of Scotland Football League|East of Scotland League]] clubs based in Perth – [[Jeanfield Swifts F.C.|Jeanfield Swifts]] and [[Kinnoull F.C.|Kinnoull]]. The senior [[rugby union|rugby]] team, [[Perthshire RFC]], play their games on the [[North Inch]] in [[Scottish National League Division Three]]. Between 1995 and 1998 the professional [[Caledonia Reds]] played some of their home matches at McDiarmid Park before they merged with [[Glasgow Warriors]].

[[Perth Leisure Pool]], to the west of the railway station on the Glasgow Road, is the city's swimming centre. The modern leisure pool complex was built in the mid-1980s to replace the traditional public swimming baths (established 1887)<ref name="Perth Leisure Pool">{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Gavin & Ruth |title=Perth in Old Photographs |publisher=Sutton Publishing Limited |year=2000 |page=105}}</ref> which used to sit just off the Dunkeld Road.

There is a large sports complex, Bell's Sports Centre, to the northwest of the city centre, at the western edge of the North Inch. Prior to the building of the Greenwich Dome, it was the largest domed building in Britain.

Perth hosts Scotland's largest [[volleyball]] event every May – the Scottish Open Volleyball Tournament. There is a highly competitive indoor competition held inside Bell's Sports Centre alongside both a competitive and fun outdoor event played on the North Inch. Teams competing traditionally camp alongside the outdoor courts with the campsite being administered by local [[cadet]]s. The Scottish Volleyball Association's annual general meeting is also held at the same time as tournament.

[[File:North Inch.jpg|thumb|left|The [[North Inch]], looking southeast towards the city centre]] The Dewar's Centre, which includes an eight-lane ice rink, has long been a main centre of [[curling]] in Scotland. Many top teams compete in this arena and many major events are held here each year. Curling is available from September to April annually. There is an indoor [[bowls|bowling]] hall, hosting major competitions.  Historically Perth had a successful [[ice hockey]] team, Perth Panthers, who played at the old ice rink on Dunkeld Road.  The rink at Dewars is the wrong shape for ice hockey, so when the team reformed in 2000 for two seasons they played their home games at [[Dundee Ice Arena]].

Perth is also home to two main parks, namely the North Inch and South Inch (the word "Inch" being an anglicisation of the Gaelic ''innis'' meaning island or meadow). The Inches were given to the city in 1377 by [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III]]. The North Inch is directly north of the city centre. It is bordered to the south by Charlotte Street and Atholl Street and to the southwest by Rose Terrace. Its western perimeter consists of part of the exercise path that circumnavigates the entire park. The River Tay bounds it to the east. A little farther to the north is the Inch's eponymous golf course.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pkc.gov.uk/northinchgolf/ |title=North Inch golf course – Perth & Kinross Council |publisher=Pkc.gov.uk |date=17 December 2012 |access-date=2 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000651/http://www.pkc.gov.uk/northinchgolf/ |archive-date=5 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Situated {{convert|1/2|mi|m}} south of the North Inch, directly across the city centre, is the South Inch. The Inches are linked by Tay Street, which runs along the western banks of the Tay. The South Inch is bordered to the north by Marshall Place and Kings Place; to the east by Shore Road; to the south by South Inch View; and to the west by St Leonards Bridge. The Edinburgh Road passes through its eastern third. The South Inch offers various activities, including [[bowls|bowling]], an [[adventure playground]], a [[skate park]], and, in the summer, a [[bouncy castle]]. The Perth Show takes place annually on the section of the Inch between the Edinburgh Road and Shore Road.

==Education==
There are many primary schools in Perth, while secondary education includes [[Perth Academy]], [[Perth Grammar School]], [[Perth High School]], [[St John's Academy]] and [[Bertha Park High School]].

Further and higher education, including a range of degrees, is available through [[Perth College UHI]], one of the largest partners in the [[University of the Highlands and Islands]]. It ran a network of learning centres across the area, in [[Blairgowrie and Rattray|Blairgowrie]], [[Crieff]], [[Kinross]] and Pathways in Perth although these closed in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=New- Learning Centres closing |url=https://www.perth.uhi.ac.uk/news/learning-centres-closing.html |website=UHI Perth College |access-date=17 July 2020}}</ref> In 2000, an interdisciplinary ''Centre for Mountain Studies'' was established at the college.<ref>{{cite web |title=Centre for Mountain Studies |url=https://www.perth.uhi.ac.uk/subject-areas/centre-for-mountain-studies/ |website=UHI Perth College}}</ref>   It also owns AST (Air Service Training) which delivers a range of aircraft engineering courses.

==Judicial system==

Perth is home to a [[Sheriff Court]], in a [[listed building]] on the banks of the river Tay. The building was designed by London architect Sir [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]], built in 1819 and stands on the site of Gowrie House, the place where a plot to kill [[King James VI]] was hatched in 1600.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/coming-to-court/location-information?loc=Perth%20Sheriff%20Court%20and%20Justice%20of%20the%20Peace%20Court |title=Location information |publisher=Scotcourts.gov.uk |access-date=2 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004230811/http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/coming-to-court/location-information?loc=Perth%20Sheriff%20Court%20and%20Justice%20of%20the%20Peace%20Court |archive-date=4 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Perth is also home to a large prison, [[HM Prison Perth]].

==Transport==
[[File:Friarton Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Friarton Bridge on the southern outskirts of Perth]]

Perth remains a key transport hub for journeys by road and rail throughout Scotland. The [[M90 motorway]], the northernmost motorway in Great Britain, runs south from the city to [[Edinburgh]]; the [[A9 road (Great Britain)|A9 road]] connects it to [[Stirling]] and [[Glasgow]] in the south west and [[Inverness]] in the north. Other major roads serving the city include the [[A85 road (Great Britain)|A85]] to [[Crieff]] and [[Crianlarich]] (and ultimately [[Oban]]), the [[A93 road (Great Britain)|A93]] to [[Blairgowrie and Rattray|Blairgowrie]] and [[Braemar]], the [[A94 road (Great Britain)|A94]] to [[Coupar Angus]] and [[Forfar]] and the [[A90 road (Great Britain)|A90]] to [[Dundee]] and Aberdeen.<ref name="Graham-Campbell p139">Graham-Campbell ''Perth: The Fair City'' 1994, p. 139.</ref>

The city itself was [[bypass route|bypass]]ed to the south and east by the M90 in the 1970s and to the west by the A9 in 1986. The M90, A9 and A93 all meet at [[Broxden Junction]], one of the busiest and most important [[road junction]]s in Scotland. Uniquely, all of Scotland's other six cities are signposted from here: [[Glasgow]] and [[Stirling]] via the A9 southbound, Dundee and Aberdeen via the A90, Edinburgh via the M90, and [[Inverness]] via the A9 northbound. The final part of the M90 included the construction of the [[Friarton Bridge]] in 1978 to facilitate travel to Dundee and Aberdeen to the east of the city, finally removing inter-city traffic from the centre.<ref name="Graham-Campbell p139" /> The bridge is the most northerly piece of the [[motorway]] network in the [[United Kingdom]].

[[File:St. Matthew's Church and Smeaton's Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Smeaton's Bridge]], with St Matthew's Church, on Tay Street, on the left, looking north from Queen's Bridge]]

There are four bridges that cross the River Tay in Perth. The northernmost structure is [[Smeaton's Bridge]] (also known as Perth Bridge and, locally, the Old Bridge), completed in 1771 and widened in 1869, which carries the automotive and pedestrian traffic of West Bridge Street (the [[A85 road|A85]]).<ref name="bridges">[http://www.perfectperth.com/index.asp?pg=60 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016214025/http://www.perfectperth.com/index.asp?pg=60 |date=16 October 2007 }}</ref>

Next, some five hundred yards downstream, is Queen's Bridge, which also carries vehicle and pedestrian traffic, this time of South Street and Tay Street. Queen's Bridge was completed in 1960, replacing the old Victoria Bridge (1902–1960), and was opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in October of that year.<ref name="bridges" />

The third bridge in the centre of Perth is a single-track railway bridge, carrying trains to and from the railway station, {{convert|1/2|mi|m}} to the north-west. It was completed in 1863. A pedestrian walkway lies on its northern side.<ref name="bridges" />

Finally, the southernmost crossing of the Tay inside Perth's boundary is the aforementioned Friarton Bridge.

The construction of a fifth bridge farther upstream (north) from the existing bridges was being considered in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/News/Perthshire/article/24160/businessman-proposes-new-bridge-tax-to-get-perth-moving.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804231716/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/News/Perthshire/article/24160/businessman-proposes-new-bridge-tax-to-get-perth-moving.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 August 2012|title=The Courier – Businessman proposes new 'bridge tax' to get Perth moving|date=4 August 2012}}</ref>

[[Perth railway station, Scotland|Perth railway station]] has regular services to [[Fife]], [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh Waverley]] via the [[Forth Bridge]], east to Dundee and Aberdeen, south to [[Stirling railway station (Scotland)|Stirling]] and [[Glasgow Queen Street railway station|Glasgow Queen Street]], and north to [[Inverness railway station|Inverness]].

However, as a result of the [[Beeching Axe]], the main line to Aberdeen through [[Strathmore, Angus|Strathmore]] via Coupar Angus and Forfar was closed to passenger traffic in 1967; Aberdeen services have since taken the less direct route via Dundee. Similarly, the direct main line to Edinburgh via [[Glenfarg]], [[Dunfermline]] and the [[Forth Bridge]] was abandoned in 1970 in favour of the longer, more circuitous route via Stirling. This closure was not recommended by Beeching, but allowed the M90 motorway to be built on top of the former the railway alignment in the Glenfarg area. In 1975, most Edinburgh trains were re-routed via Ladybank and the Forth Bridge, with some improvement in journey time.

There are two direct trains per day to [[London]], the ''[[Highland Chieftain]]'' operated by [[London North Eastern Railway]] to [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] (from Inverness), while the ''[[Caledonian Sleeper]]'' runs overnight to [[Euston railway station|Euston]].

Local buses are run by [[Stagecoach East Scotland]]. Inter-city bus travel is made from Leonard Street bus station and connects to most major destinations in Scotland. The budget [[Megabus (United Kingdom)|Megabus]] service is centred on Broxden Junction ({{convert|2+1/4|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} outside the city centre) and runs direct buses to Scotland's largest cities plus [[Manchester]] and [[London]] in [[England]]. In addition, there is a [[park and ride]] service from the services at Broxden to the city centre.

Perth has a small airport; [[Perth Airport (Scotland)|Perth Airport]] is located at [[Scone, Perthshire|New Scone]], {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east of Perth. There are no commercial flights out of this airport, but it is used by private aircraft and for pilot training. The nearest major commercial airports are [[Edinburgh Airport]], [[Glasgow Airport]] and [[Aberdeen Airport]]. [[Dundee Airport]], which is a 20-minute drive from Perth, offers flights to [[London Stansted Airport]] as well as charter, engineering and training facilities.
