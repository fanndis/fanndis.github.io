<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Asperger syndrome''' ('''AS'''), also known as '''Asperger's''', is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]] characterized by significant difficulties in [[Interpersonal relationships|social interaction]] and [[nonverbal communication]], along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests.<ref name=NIH2015 /> It is an [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD),<ref>{{Cite web|title=What Are the Types of Autism Spectrum Disorders?|url=https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders|access-date=2020-09-10|website=WebMD|language=en}}</ref> but differs from other ASDs by relatively unimpaired [[language development|language]] and [[cognitive development|intelligence]].<ref name=ICD10>{{cite web|title=F84.5 Asperger syndrome|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F84.5|website=World Health Organization|access-date=13 March 2016|date=2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102042503/http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F84.5|archive-date=2 November 2015}}</ref> Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common.<ref name=McPart2006>{{cite journal | vauthors = McPartland J, Klin A | title = Asperger's syndrome | journal = Adolescent Medicine Clinics | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 771–88; abstract xiii | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17030291 | doi = 10.1016/j.admecli.2006.06.010 | doi-broken-date = 24 October 2020}}</ref><ref name=Baskin>{{cite journal | vauthors = Baskin JH, Sperber M, Price BH | title = Asperger syndrome revisited | journal = Reviews in Neurological Diseases | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16596080}}</ref> Signs usually begin before two years of age and typically last for a person's entire life.<ref name=NIH2015 />

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defined Asperger syndrome (AS) as one of the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD) or [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are a [[spectrum disorder|spectrum of psychological conditions]] that are characterized by abnormalities of [[social interaction]] and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior.

As a [[pervasive developmental disorder]], Asperger syndrome is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom.

A lack, or [[wiktionary:dearth|dearth]], of ''demonstrated'' [[empathy]] affects aspects of communal living for persons with Asperger syndrome.<ref name=Baskin /> Individuals with AS experience difficulties in basic elements of social interaction, which may include a failure to develop friendships or to seek shared enjoyments or achievements with others (e.g., showing others objects of interest); a lack of social or emotional [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] (social "games" give-and-take mechanic); and impaired [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal behaviors]] in areas such as [[eye contact]], [[facial expression]], posture, and gesture.<ref name=McPart2006 />

People with AS may not be as withdrawn around others, compared with those with other, more debilitating forms of [[autism]]; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's [[feelings]] or reactions, such as a wish to change the topic of talk or end the interaction.<ref name=Klin /> This social awkwardness has been called "active but odd".<ref name=McPart2006 /> Such failures to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings and may come across as rude or insensitive.<ref name=Klin /> However, not all individuals with AS will approach others. Some of them may even display [[selective mutism]], not speaking at all to most people and excessively to specific others. Some may choose only to talk to people they like.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/912296-overview|work=Medscape eMedicine|title=Asperger's Syndrome| vauthors = Brasic JR|date=7 July 2010|access-date=25 November 2010|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101223170232/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/912296-overview |archive-date=23 December 2010}}</ref>

The cognitive ability of children with AS often allows them to articulate [[social norms]] in a laboratory context,<ref name=McPart2006 /> where they may be able to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations.<ref name=Klin /> People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naïve. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.<ref name=McPart2006 />

==== Violent or criminal behavior ====
The [[hypothesis]] that individuals with AS are predisposed to violent or criminal behavior has been investigated but is not supported by data.{{update after|2020|1|24}}<ref name="McPart2006" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen D, Evans C, Hider A, Hawkins S, Peckett H, Morgan H | s2cid = 12999370 | title = Offending behaviour in adults with Asperger syndrome | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 748–58 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 17805955 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0442-9}}</ref> More evidence suggests that children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome are victims, rather than offenders.<ref name=Tsatsanis>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsatsanis KD | title = Outcome research in Asperger syndrome and autism | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–63, vi | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12512398 | doi = 10.1016/S1056-4993(02)00056-1}}</ref>

A 2008 review found that an overwhelming number of reported violent criminals with Asperger syndrome also had other coexisting psychotic [[psychiatric disorders]] such as [[schizoaffective disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Newman SS, Ghaziuddin M | s2cid = 207158193 | title = Violent crime in Asperger syndrome: the role of psychiatric comorbidity | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 38 | issue = 10 | pages = 1848–52 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18449633 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-008-0580-8}}</ref>

=== Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior ===
People with Asperger syndrome can display behavior, interests, and activities that are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused. They may stick to inflexible routines, move in [[Stereotypy|stereotyped]] and repetitive ways, preoccupy themselves with parts of objects, or engage in compulsive behaviors like lining objects up to form patterns.<ref name=BehaveNet />

Pursuit of specific and narrow areas of interest is one of the most striking among possible features of AS.<ref name=McPart2006 /> Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic.<ref name=McPart2006 /><ref name=Klin /> For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography.<ref name=McPart2006 /> This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6.<ref name=McPart2006 /> Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.<ref name=Klin />

Stereotyped and repetitive motor behaviors are a core part of the diagnosis of AS and other ASDs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = South M, Ozonoff S, McMahon WM | s2cid = 36078197 | title = Repetitive behavior profiles in Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–58 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15909401 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-004-1992-8}}</ref> They include hand movements such as [[stimming|flapping]] or twisting, and complex whole-body movements.<ref name=BehaveNet /> These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than [[tic]]s, which are usually faster, less rhythmical, and less often symmetrical.<ref name=RapinTS>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rapin I | title = Autism spectrum disorders: relevance to Tourette syndrome | journal = Advances in Neurology | volume = 85 | pages = 89–101 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11530449}}</ref> However, in addition to this, various studies have reported a consistent comorbidity between AS and [[Tourette syndrome]] in the range of 8–20%,<ref name=RapinTS/><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Steyaert JG, De la Marche W|year=2008|title=What's new in autism?|url=https://www.academia.edu/24262348|journal=Eur J Pediatr|volume=167|issue=10|pages=1091–101|doi=10.1007/s00431-008-0764-4|pmid=18597114|s2cid=11831418}}</ref><ref name="Mazzone">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mazzone L, Ruta L, Reale L | title = Psychiatric comorbidities in asperger syndrome and high functioning autism: diagnostic challenges | journal = Annals of General Psychiatry | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 16 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22731684 | pmc = 3416662 | doi = 10.1186/1744-859X-11-16}}</ref><ref name="Gillberg&Billstedt2000"/> with one figure as high as 80% for tics of some kind or another,<ref name="Gillberg&Billstedt2000" />  for which several explanations have been put forward, including common genetic factors and [[dopamine]], [[glutamate]], or [[serotonin]] abnormalities.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zafeiriou DI, Ververi A, Vargiami E | title = Childhood autism and associated comorbidities | journal = Brain & Development | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–72 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17084999 | doi = 10.1016/j.braindev.2006.09.003 | s2cid = 16386209}}</ref>

According to the Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA) diagnostic test, a lack of interest in fiction and a positive preference towards non-fiction is common among adults with AS.<ref name=ASAdulthood />

=== Speech and language ===
Although individuals with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, [[language acquisition]] and use is often atypical.<ref name=Klin /> Abnormalities include [[verbosity]]; abrupt transitions; literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance; use of metaphor meaningful only to the speaker; [[Auditory processing disorder|auditory perception deficits]]; unusually [[Pedantic speech|pedantic]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|formal]], or [[Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry|idiosyncratic]] speech; and oddities in loudness, [[Tone (linguistics)|pitch]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and rhythm.<ref name=McPart2006 /> [[Echolalia]] has also been observed in individuals with AS.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Frith U | s2cid = 978233 | title = Social communication and its disorder in autism and Asperger syndrome | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–53 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 22302727 | doi = 10.1177/026988119601000108}}</ref>

Three aspects of communication patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, [[Tangential speech|tangential]] and [[circumstantial speech]], and marked [[verbosity]]. Although [[inflection]] and intonation may be less rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky, or loud. Speech may convey a sense of [[Coherence (linguistics)|incoherence]]; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide [[Context (language use)|context]] for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.<ref name=Klin />

Children with AS may have a sophisticated vocabulary at a young age and such children have often been colloquially called "little professors"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000618mag-asperger.html|title=The Little Professor Syndrome|first=Lawrence|last=Osborne|work=The New York Times|date=18 June 2000}}</ref> but have difficulty understanding [[figurative language]] and tend to use language literally.<ref name=McPart2006 /> Children with AS appear to have particular weaknesses in areas of nonliteral language that include humor, irony, teasing, and sarcasm. Although individuals with AS usually understand the cognitive basis of [[humor]], they seem to lack understanding of the intent of humor to share enjoyment with others.<ref name=Kasari /> Despite strong evidence of impaired humor appreciation, anecdotal reports of humor in individuals with AS seem to challenge some psychological theories of AS and autism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | s2cid = 22187553 | title = Humor in autism and Asperger syndrome | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 521–31 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15628606 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-004-2547-8}}</ref>

=== Motor and sensory perception ===
Individuals with Asperger syndrome may have signs or symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but can affect the individual or the family.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Filipek PA, Accardo PJ, Baranek GT, Cook EH, Dawson G, Gordon B, Gravel JS, Johnson CP, Kallen RJ, Levy SE, Minshew NJ, Ozonoff S, Prizant BM, Rapin I, Rogers SJ, Stone WL, Teplin S, Tuchman RF, Volkmar FR | s2cid = 145113684 | title = The screening and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 439–84 | date = December 1999 | pmid = 10638459 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021943802493}}</ref> These include differences in perception and problems with motor skills, sleep, and emotions.

Children with AS may be delayed in acquiring skills requiring [[dexterity]], such as riding a bicycle or opening a jar, and may seem to move awkwardly or feel "uncomfortable in their own skin". They may be poorly coordinated or have an odd or bouncy gait or posture, poor handwriting, or problems with [[motor coordination]].<ref name="McPart2006" /><ref name="Klin" /> They may show problems with [[proprioception]] (sensation of body position) on measures of [[developmental coordination disorder]] ([[motor planning]] disorder), balance, [[tandem gait]], and finger-[[thumb apposition]].

== Causes ==
{{Further|Causes of autism}}
Hans Asperger described common traits among his patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific genetic factor has yet been identified, multiple factors are believed to play a role in the [[Expressivity (genetics)|expression]] of autism, given the variability in symptoms seen in children.<ref name=McPart2006 /><ref name="Foster" /> Evidence for a [[Behavioral genetics|genetic link]] is that AS tends to run in families where more family members have limited behavioral symptoms similar to AS (for example, some problems with social interaction, or with language and reading skills).<ref name=NINDS /> Most [[behavioral genetic]] research suggests that all [[Heritability of autism|autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms]], but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism.<ref name="McPart2006" /> There may be shared genes in which particular [[allele]]s make an individual vulnerable, and varying combinations result in differing severity and symptoms in each person with AS.<ref name=NINDS />

A few ASD cases have been linked to exposure to [[Teratology#Teratogenic agents|teratogens]] (agents that cause [[birth defect]]s) during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]]. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that ASD arises very early in development.<ref name=Arndt>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM | s2cid = 17797266 | title = The teratology of autism | journal = International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 189–99 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15749245 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001}}</ref> Many [[environmental factor]]s have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutter M | title = Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning | journal = Acta Paediatrica | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–15 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15858952 | doi = 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x | s2cid = 79259285 | author-link = Michael Rutter}}</ref>

Although the specific underpinnings of AS or factors that distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged,<ref name=McPart2006 /> it is still possible that AS's mechanism is separate from other ASDs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rinehart NJ, Bradshaw JL, Brereton AV, Tonge BJ | s2cid = 563134 | title = A clinical and neurobehavioural review of high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder | journal = The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 762–70 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12406118 | doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1614.2002.01097.x}}</ref>

{{Main|Diagnosis of Asperger syndrome}}
Standard diagnostic criteria require impairment in social interaction and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, activities, and interests, without significant delay in language or cognitive development.
