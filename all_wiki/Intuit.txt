'''Intuit Inc.''' is an American [[business software|business]] and [[financial software]] company that develops and sells financial, accounting, and [[tax preparation]] software and related services for [[small business]]es, [[accountants]], and individuals. The company is headquartered in [[Mountain View, California]] and the CEO is [https://www.intuit.com/company/executives/sasan-goodarzi/ Sasan Goodarzi]. {{As of|2019|post=,}} more than 95% of its revenues and earnings come from its activities within the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://s23.q4cdn.com/935127502/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2019/q4/817655_007_Print_CLEAN.pdf|title=2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K|publisher=Intuit.com |page=6|quote=Total international net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2017.|accessdate=December 5, 2019}}</ref> Intuit's products include the tax preparation application [[TurboTax]], personal finance app [[Mint.com|Mint]] and the [[small business]] accounting program [[QuickBooks]].

Intuit has lobbied extensively against the IRS creating its own online system of tax filing (in most wealthy countries, governments have simplified tax filing for its citizens, thus making software such as TurboTax unnecessary for most citizens).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/congress-is-about-to-ban-the-government-from-offering-free-online-tax-filing-thank-turbotax|title=Congress Is About to Ban the Government From Offering Free Online Tax Filing.

==History==
The company was founded in 1983 by [[Scott Cook]] and [[Tom Proulx]] in [[Palo Alto, California]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intuit.com/about_intuit/press_room/fast_facts/ |title=Company Fast Facts |publisher=Intuit |accessdate=2012-01-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914211131/http://www.intuit.com/about_intuit/press_room/fast_facts/ |archivedate=2008-09-14 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=QuickBooks-Maker Intuit Plans To Invest In Indian Startup Ecosystem|url=https://inc42.com/buzz/quickbooks-maker-intuit-looks-to-tap-indian-startup-ecosystem|date=2018-11-09|website=Inc42 Media|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=8 San Diego Brands Explain How They Made It to the Top|url=https://www.sandiegomagazine.com/features/8-san-diego-brands-explain-how-they-made-it-to-the-top/article_e12c6d99-67d9-5294-bea9-cb3bedea6982.html|website=San Diego Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Scott Cook to Address HBS Graduating Class|url=https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2015/03/scott-cook-to-speak-at-hbs|date=2015-03-31|website=Harvard Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref>

Intuit was conceived by Scott Cook, whose prior work at Procter & Gamble helped him realize that [[personal computer]]s would lend themselves towards replacements for paper-and-pencil based personal accounting.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heiserman |first=Hewitt |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1591391369 |title=Inside Intuit book Excerpt – Chapter 1 |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2012-01-27}}</ref> On his quest to find a programmer he ended up running into [[Tom Proulx]] at [[Stanford]]. The two started Intuit, which initially operated out of a modest room on University Avenue in [[Palo Alto]]. The first version of Quicken was coded in Microsoft's [[BASIC programming language]] for the IBM PC and [[UCSD Pascal]] for the [[Apple II]] by Tom Proulx and had to contend with a dozen serious competitors.

In 1991  Microsoft decided to produce a competitor to Quicken called [[Microsoft Money]]. To win retailers' loyalty, Intuit included a US$15 rebate coupon, redeemable on software customers purchased in their stores. This was the first time a software company offered a rebate.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/How-Intuit-bested-Microsoft/2030-1012_3-5100925.html |title=How Intuit bested Microsoft |work=[https://cnet.com] |date=November 2, 2003 |accessdate=2011-02-14 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/how-intuit-bested-microsoft/|title=How Intuit bested Microsoft|website=CNET}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/how-intuit-managed-to-hold-off-microsoft/|title=How Intuit managed to hold off Microsoft|first=Ina|last=Fried|website=CNET}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRs_4U43UcEC | title=Inside Intuit: How the Makers of Quicken Beat Microsoft and Revolutionized an Entire Industry| isbn=9781591391364| last1=Taylor| first1=Suzanne E| last2=Schroeder| first2=Kathy| year=2003}}</ref>

Roughly around the same time the company engaged [[John Doerr]] of [[Kleiner Perkins]] and diversified its product lineup. In 1993 Intuit went public and used the proceeds to make a key acquisition: the tax-preparation software company Chipsoft based in [[San Diego]]. The time after the [[Initial public offering|IPO]] was marked by rapid growth and culminated with a buyout offer from [[Microsoft]] in 1994; at this time Intuit's [[market capitalization]] reached US$2 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]].

When the buyout fell through because of the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s disapproval, the company came under intense pressure in the late 1990s when Microsoft started to compete vigorously with its core Quicken business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10262344-56.html|title=How Intuit managed to hold off Microsoft|publisher=CBS Interactive|website=CNET|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> In response, Intuit launched new web-based products and put more emphasis on QuickBooks and on TurboTax. The company made a number of investments around this time. Among others, it purchased a large stake in [[Excite]] and acquired Lacerte Software, a [[Dallas]]-based developer of tax preparation software used by tax professionals. It also divested itself of its online bill payment service unit and extended and strengthened its partnership with [[CheckFree]].

In June 2013, Intuit announced it would sell its financial services unit to private equity firm [[Thoma Bravo]] for $1.03 billion.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/01/us-intuit-reorganization-idUSBRE9600LV20130701| title=Intuit to sell financial services unit for $1 billion | author=Aman Shah | publisher=Reuters | date=1 July 2013}}</ref>

In June 2015, Intuit laid off approximately 5% of its workforce as part of a company reorganization.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/26/intuit-lays-off-399-employees-in-company-realignment| title=Intuit Lays Off 399 Employees In Company Realignment| author=Matt Lynley | publisher=Techcrunch | date=26 July 2015}}</ref>

As of May 2018, Intuit had more than US$5 billion in annual [[revenue]] and a market capitalization of about US$50 billion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In August 2018,  the company announced that [https://www.intuit.com/company/executives/sasan-goodarzi/ Sasan Goodarzi] would become Intuit's CEO at the beginning of 2019.

In August 2020, Intuit QuickBooks Canada is expected to reveal intentions to partner with Digital Main Street, as the company aims to help digitally turn Canadian small businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=13 August 2020|title=INTUIT CANADA JOINS DIGITAL MAIN STREET TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES WITH DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION|url=https://betakit.com/intuit-canada-joins-digital-main-street-to-support-small-businesses-with-digital-transformation/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 August 2020|website=betakit}}</ref>

'''Intuit Canada ULC''', an indirect [[Subsidiary|wholly owned subsidiary]] of Intuit, is a developer of financial management and tax preparation software for [[personal finance]] and [[small business]] [[accounting software|accounting]]. Services are delivered on a variety of platforms including [[desktop software|application software]], [[Software plus services|software connected to services]], [[SaaS|software as a service]], [[platform as a service]] and [[mobile application]]s. Intuit Canada has employees located all across Canada, with offices in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], and [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]].

'''Intuit Canada''' traces its origins to the 1993 acquisition by Intuit of a Canadian [[tax preparation software]] developer. In 1992, Edmontonians and [[University of Alberta]] graduates [[Bruce Johnson (Canadian executive)|Bruce Johnson]] and Chad Frederick had built a [[Tax preparation software|tax preparation]] product called WINTAX – Canada's first{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} [[Microsoft Windows]]-based personal tax preparation software. In 1993, they agreed to be acquired by Chipsoft, manufacturer of the U.S. personal income tax software [[TurboTax]]. Shortly after the WINTAX acquisition, Chipsoft agreed to merge with Intuit, the developer of the [[Quicken]] financial software.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rick |last=Pilger |url=http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=320 |title=A taxing success story |date=2001-07-09 |work=Express News |publisher=University of Alberta |accessdate=2008-01-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615083202/http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=320 |archivedate=2008-06-15 }}</ref> Intuit Canada continued to update and support the WINTAX software, which was renamed QuickTax in 1995 and then renamed TurboTax in 2010. Intuit Canada quickly became the hub for international development at Intuit, producing localized versions of Quicken and [[QuickBooks]] for Canada (in French and English) and the United Kingdom. The U.K. version of Quicken was discontinued in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quicken.co.uk/index.html |title=Important notice for Quicken Users |work=quicken.co.uk |publisher=Intuit Limited |accessdate=2008-01-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213124622/http://www.quicken.co.uk/index.html |archivedate=2007-12-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==== Discontinued products of Intuit Canada ====

*TaxWiz – Tax preparation software – the company purchased in 2002, discontinued in 2007{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}
*WillExpert – A software package for preparing personal wills (for use within all of Canada with the exception of Quebec, due to specific provincial legislation)

'''Note:''' In 2008, Intuit Canada discontinued the TaxWiz software and added QuickTax Basic to their lineup.  Changes made by the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] forced Intuit and other tax preparing software companies to limit the number of returns available from their software to 20. This caused Intuit Canada to stop offering QuickTax Pro50 and Pro100 products, and they now offer QuickTax 20 as an alternative. Intuit Canada has since announced that for the 2010 tax year, they will discontinue use of the name QuickTax and replace it with the name [[TurboTax]] – thus bringing the product in line with Intuit's American tax-filing software.<ref>https://2009.quicktaxonline.ca/help/main?c=collection_en&_swlg=en&pid=4&tid=d_turbo_tax_rebrand&stepId=&pu=0&mode=PROFILENOTCOMPLETED&br=intuit{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

== Online communities ==
Intuit has several online communities, some of which offer integration or cross-sells into other Intuit products. QuickBooks online community for QuickBooks users and small business owners, Quicken Online Community for Quicken users and those who need help with the personal finances, and the Accountant Online Community and Jump Up. Each consists of blogs, an expert locator map and event calendar, forums and discussion groups, podcasts, videocasts and webinars, and other user-created content.

JumpUp (formerly JackRabbit Beta) is a free social networking and resources site for small business owners and/or start-ups. Free tools and services include an interactive business planner, online training for developing a successful business plan, starting costs calculator, cash flow calculator, break-even calculator, templates for business planning and sample business plans.

TaxAlmanac is a free online tax research resource. The site includes information including the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations, Tax Court Cases, and a variety of articles.

Modeled after [[English Wikipedia]], TaxAlmanac was launched in May 2005. The June 6, 2005 edition of Time magazine featured an article entitled "It's a Wiki, Wiki World"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1066904,00.html |title=It's a Wiki, Wiki World. |work=Time |date=2005-05-29 |first=Chris |last=Taylor |accessdate=2007-06-13 }}</ref> on English Wikipedia in which TaxAlmanac was highlighted as "A Community of Customers". The November 21, 2005 edition of ''[[Business Week]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_47/b3960414.htm |title=The Web Smart 50 |date=2005-11-21 |accessdate=2007-06-13 }}</ref> featured an article titled "50 Smart Ways to Use the Web" in which TaxAlmanac was selected as one of the 50. TaxAlmanac made the short list as one of the 7 in the collaboration category.

Intuit shut down TaxAlmanac effective June 1, 2014.<ref>"The TaxAlmanac.org website will be going offline permanently on 6/1/14. The groups responsible for maintaining the content on this website are no longer able to provide the required maintenance and updates necessary to maintain the website's on-going integrity."|url=taxalmanac.org</ref> Many of the users have migrated to a new site called TaxProTalk.com.<ref>url=https://accountants-community.intuit.com/questions/904294-taxalmanac-is-closing-but-it-s-been-replaced-by-taxprotalk-com</ref>

Zipingo was a free [[website]] where users could rate services such as [[independent contractor|contractors]], [[restaurants]], and other businesses. Ratings and comments were either entered from the website or through Quicken and QuickBooks. The site was closed by Intuit on August 23, 2007.<ref>Zipingo.
