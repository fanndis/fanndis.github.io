== History ==
{{Main|History of the Portuguese language}}

When the [[Rome|Romans]] arrived in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 216&nbsp;BC, they brought the [[Latin language]] with them, from which all Romance languages are descended. The language was spread by Roman soldiers, settlers, and merchants, who built Roman cities mostly near the settlements of previous [[Celts|Celtic]] civilizations established long before the Roman arrivals. For that reason, the language has kept a relevant substratum of much older, [[Atlantic Europe]]an [[Megalithic Culture]]<ref>Benozzo, F. (2018): "Uma paisagem atlântica pré-histórica. Etnogénese e etno-filologia paleo-mesolítica das tradições galega e portuguesa", in proceedings of Jornadas das Letras Galego-Portugesas 2015–2017. Università de Bologna, DTS and Academia Galega da Língua Portuguesa. pp. 159–170</ref> and [[Celts|Celtic culture]],<ref name="Gramatica 2007">{{Citation |last=Bagno |first=Marcos |title=Gramática Histórica do latim ao português brasileiro |date=2007 |url=https://www.academia.edu/29728732 |trans-title=Historical Grammar from Latin to Brazilian Portuguese |publisher=University of Brasília |via=www.academia.edu}}</ref> part of the [[Hispano-Celtic languages|Hispano-Celtic group]] of ancient languages.<ref name="Colera 2007 p.750 quote">"In the northwest of the Iberian Peninula, and more specifically between the west and north Atlantic coasts and an imaginary line running north-south and linking Oviedo and Merida, there is a corpus of Latin inscriptions with particular characteristics of its own. This corpus contains some linguistic features that are clearly Celtic and others that in our opinion are not Celtic. The former we shall group, for the moment, under the label northwestern Hispano-Celtic. The latter are the same features found in well-documented contemporary inscriptions in the region occupied by the Lusitanians, and therefore belonging to the variety known as LUSITANIAN, or more broadly as GALLO-LUSITANIAN. As we have already said, we do not consider this variety to belong to the Celtic language family." Jordán Colera 2007: p.750</ref>

Between AD 409 and AD 711, as the [[Roman Empire]] collapsed in [[Western Europe]], the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by [[Germanic peoples]] of the [[Migration Period]]. The occupiers, mainly [[Suebi]],<ref>{{Citation |title=Comparative Grammar of Latin 34 |url=http://ling.cornell.edu/people/Weiss/CGL_34_Language_Contact_5.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041334/http://ling.cornell.edu/people/Weiss/CGL_34_Language_Contact_5.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.arkeotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm Ethnologic Map of Pre-Roman Iberia (c. 200 BC)].

(in Portuguese)</ref> who originally spoke [[Germanic languages]], quickly adopted late Roman culture and the [[Vulgar Latin]] dialects of the peninsula and over the next 300 years totally integrated into the local populations. Some Germanic words from that period, are part of the Portuguese lexicon. After the [[Moors|Moorish]] invasion beginning in 711, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] became the administrative and common language in the conquered regions, but most of the [[Mozarabs|remaining Christian population]] continued to speak a form of [[Romance languages|Romance]] commonly known as [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]], which lasted three centuries longer in [[Spain]]. Like other Neo-Latin and European languages, Portuguese has adopted a significant number of [[loanword]]s from [[Greek language|Greek]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.eduportal.gr/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/www.eduportal.gr_media_files_lexeis_2.pdf |title=Palavras que cheiram mar 2: Etimologia de mais de 1000 Palavras Gregas Usadas em Português (Λέξεις που μυρίζουν θάλασσα) |first=Dimitrios |last=Koutantos }}</ref> mainly in technical and scientific terminology. These borrowings occurred via Latin, and later during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

Portuguese evolved from the medieval language, known today by linguists as [[Galician-Portuguese]], Old Portuguese or Old Galician, of the northwestern medieval [[Kingdom of Galicia]] and [[County of Portugal]].<ref>https://www.academia.edu/30975383/Vocabulário_Ortográfico_da_Galiza_AGLP_2015_</ref>[[File:Idioma galaicoportugués.png|thumb|Spoken area of [[Galician-Portuguese]] (also known as Old Portuguese or Medieval Galician) in the kingdoms of Galicia and León around the 10th century, before the separation of [[Galician language|Galician]] and Portuguese]]It is in Latin administrative documents of the 9th century that written Galician-Portuguese words and phrases are first recorded. This phase is known as Proto-Portuguese, which lasted from the 9th century until the 12th-century independence of the [[County of Portugal]] from the Kingdom of León, which had by then assumed reign over [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].

In the first part of the [[Galician-Portuguese]] period (from the 12th to the 14th century), the language was increasingly used for documents and other written forms. For some time, it was the language of preference for [[lyric poetry]] in Christian [[Hispania]], much as [[Occitan]] was the language of the [[Occitan literature#Poetry of the troubadours|poetry of the troubadours]] in France. The Occitan digraphs ''lh'' and ''nh'', used in its classical orthography, were adopted by the [[Portuguese alphabet#Basic digraphs|orthography of Portuguese]], presumably by [[Gerald of Braga]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lay |first=Stephen |date=2015 |title=Sanctity and Social Alienation in Twelfth-Century Braga as Portrayed in the Vita Sancti Geraldi |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=153–168 |doi=10.5699/portstudies.31.2.0153 |journal=Portuguese Studies}}</ref> a monk from [[Moissac]], who became bishop of [[Braga]] in Portugal in 1047, playing a major role in modernizing written Portuguese using classical [[Occitan language|Occitan]] norms.<ref>Jean-Pierre Juge (2001) ''Petit précis – Chronologie occitane – Histoire & civilisation'', p. 25</ref> Portugal became an independent kingdom in 1139, under King [[Afonso I of Portugal]]. In 1290, King [[Denis of Portugal]] created the first Portuguese university in Lisbon (the ''Estudos Gerais'', which later moved to [[University of Coimbra|Coimbra]]) and decreed for Portuguese, then simply called the "common language", to be known as the Portuguese language and used officially.

In the second period of Old Portuguese, in the 15th and 16th centuries, with the [[Age of Discovery|Portuguese discoveries]], the language was taken to many regions of Africa, Asia, and the [[Americas]]. By the mid-16th century, Portuguese had become a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in Asia and Africa, used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and Europeans of all nationalities.

Its spread was helped by mixed marriages between Portuguese and local people and by its association with [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[missionary]] efforts, which led to the formation of [[creole language]]s such as that called [[Kristang language|Kristang]] in many parts of Asia (from the word ''cristão'', "Christian"). The language continued to be popular in parts of Asia until the 19th century. Some Portuguese-speaking Christian communities in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]] preserved their language even after they were isolated from Portugal.

The end of the Old Portuguese period was marked by the publication of the ''Cancioneiro Geral'' by [[Garcia de Resende]], in 1516. The early times of Modern Portuguese, which spans the period from the 16th century to the present day, were characterized by an increase in the number of learned words borrowed from [[Classical Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]] because of the [[Renaissance]] (learned words borrowed from Latin also came from [[Renaissance Latin]], the form of Latin during that time), which greatly enriched the lexicon. Most literate Portuguese speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing&nbsp;– and eventually speech&nbsp;– in Portuguese.<ref>{{Citation |last=de Assis |first=Maria Cristina |title=História da língua portuguesa |url=http://biblioteca.virtual.ufpb.br/files/histaria_da_langua_portuguesa_1360184313.pdf}}</ref>

Spanish author [[Miguel de Cervantes]] once called Portuguese "the sweet and gracious language", while the Brazilian poet [[Olavo Bilac]] described it as {{lang|pt|a última flor do Lácio, inculta e bela}} ("the last flower of [[Latium]], naive and beautiful"). Portuguese is also termed "the language of Camões", after [[Luís Vaz de Camões]], one of the greatest literary figures in the Portuguese language and author of the Portuguese [[epic poem]] ''[[The Lusiads]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Watts |first=Henry Edward |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofmigueldece00watt |title=Miguel de Cervantes: His Life & Works |publisher=Walter Scott |year=1891 |location=London |author-link=Henry Edward Watts}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Literature|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofli01ship|url-access=registration|first=Joseph T.|last=Shipley|publisher=Philosophical Library|year=1946|page=1188}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A historical companion to postcolonial literatures: continental Europe and its empires|first1=Prem |last1=Poddar |first2=Rajeev S. |last2=Patke |first3=Lars |last3=Jensen |publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2008|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ghah5S3usnsC&q=%22language+of+Cam%C3%B5es%22&pg=PA431|chapter=Introduction: The Myths and Realities of Portuguese (Post) Colonial Society|page=431|isbn=978-0-7486-2394-5}}</ref>

<small>Notes:

#[[Macau]] is one of the two autonomous [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China]] (the other being [[English language|Anglophone]] [[Hong Kong]], a former [[United Kingdom|British]] colony).
# [[Equatorial Guinea]] adopted Portuguese as one of its official languages in 2007, being admitted to CPLP in 2014. The use of the Portuguese language in this country is limited. However, a Portuguese-based creole language, [[Annobonese Creole]], is used, mainly on the islands of [[Annobon]] and [[Bioko]].</small>

The combined population of the entire [[Lusophone]] area was estimated at 279 million in July 2017. This number does not include the Lusophone [[diaspora]], estimated at approximately 10 million people (including 4.5 million Portuguese, 3 million Brazilians, and half a million Cape Verdeans, among others), although it is hard to obtain official accurate numbers of diasporic Portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of Lusophone territory or are children of immigrants, and may have only a basic command of the language. Additionally, a large part of the diaspora is a part of the already-counted population of the Portuguese-speaking countries and territories, such as the high number of Brazilian and [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|PALOP]] emigrant citizens in Portugal or the high number of Portuguese emigrant citizens in the PALOP and Brazil.

The Portuguese language therefore serves more than 250 million people daily, who have direct or indirect legal, juridical and social contact with it, varying from the only language used in any contact, to only education, contact with local or international administration, commerce and services or the simple sight of road signs, public information and advertising in Portuguese.

=== Future ===
According to estimates by [[UNESCO]], Portuguese is the fastest-growing [[European language]] after [[English language|English]] and the language has, according to the newspaper ''The Portugal News'' publishing data given from UNESCO, the highest potential for growth as an international language in [[southern Africa]] and [[South America]].<ref name="The Portugal News">{{cite web|url= http://www.theportugalnews.com/cgi-bin/article.pl?id=906-9|title= Portuguese language gaining popularity|publisher= Anglopress Edicões e Publicidade Lda|date= 5 May 2007|accessdate= 18 May 2011|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120318152307/http://www.theportugalnews.com/cgi-bin/article.pl?id=906-9|archive-date= 18 March 2012|url-status= dead}}</ref> Portuguese is a globalized language spoken officially on five continents, and as a second language by millions worldwide.

Since 1991, when Brazil signed into the economic community of [[Mercosul]] with other South American nations, namely Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Portuguese is either mandatory, or taught, in the schools of those South American countries.

Although early in the 21st century, after Macau was returned to China and Brazilian immigration to Japan slowed down, the use of Portuguese was in decline in Asia, it is once again becoming a language of opportunity there, mostly because of increased diplomatic and financial ties with economically powerful Portuguese-speaking countries (Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, etc.) in the world.<ref>{{cite web|last=Leach |first=Michael |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6469/is_92/ai_n29406744/ |title=talking Portuguese; China and East Timor |accessdate=18 May 2011 |website=Arena Magazine |year=2007 |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105033001/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6469/is_92/ai_n29406744/ |archivedate=5 November 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.macaomagazine.net/china/promising-future-portuguese-language-china |title=Promising future for Portuguese language in China |last=Bilrero |first=António |date=15 March 2018 |website=Macao Magazine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702230400/https://www.macaomagazine.net/china/promising-future-portuguese-language-china |archive-date=2019-07-02}}</ref>

{{Main|Portuguese dialects|List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language}}
[[File:Sprachen_Osttimors-en.png|thumb|Ethnically diverse [[East Timor]] has Portuguese as one of its official languages]]

{{lang|pt|Você}}, a pronoun meaning "you", is used for educated, formal, and colloquial respectful speech in most Portuguese-speaking regions. In the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, {{lang|pt|você}} is virtually absent from the spoken language. Riograndense and European Portuguese normally distinguishes formal from informal speech by verbal conjugation. Informal speech employs {{lang|pt|tu}} followed by second person verbs, formal language retains the formal {{lang|pt|você}}, followed by the third person conjugation.

Conjugation of verbs in {{lang|pt|tu}} has three different forms in Brazil (verb "to see": {{lang|pt|tu viste?}}, in the traditional second person, {{lang|pt|tu viu?}}, in the third person, and {{lang|pt|tu visse?}}, in the innovative second person), the conjugation used in the Brazilian states of Pará, Santa Catarina and Maranhão being generally traditional second person, the kind that is used in other Portuguese-speaking countries and learned in Brazilian schools.

The predominance of Southeastern-based media products has established {{lang|pt|você}} as the pronoun of choice for the second person singular in both writing and multimedia communications. However, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the country's main cultural center, the usage of {{lang|pt|tu}} has been expanding ever since the end of the 20th century,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.celsul.org.br/Encontros/09/artigos/Viviane%20dos%20Santos.pdf |title=A Constituição de Corpora Orais Para a Análise das Formas de Tratamento |last=Viviane Maia dos Santos |publisher=Anais do IX Encontro do CELSUL Palhoça, SC, out. 2010 Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034721/http://www.celsul.org.br/Encontros/09/artigos/Viviane%20dos%20Santos.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |access-date=10 August 2017}}</ref> being most frequent among youngsters, and a number of studies have also shown an increase in its use in a number of other Brazilian dialects.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.uel.br/revistas/uel/index.php/signum/article/view/11776/11181 |title='Por onde tá "o tu"?' no português falado no Maranhão |last=Béliche Alves |first=Cibelle Corrêa |journal=Signum: Estudos da Linguagem |volume=15 |number=1 |pages=13–31 |year=2012 |doi=10.5433/2237-4876.2012v15n1p13 |accessdate=10 August 2017|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Loregian-Penkal |first=Loremi |date=2005 |title=Alternância tu/você em Santa Catarina: uma abordagem variacionista |url=http://www.gel.org.br/estudoslinguisticos/edicoesanteriores/4publica-estudos-2005/4publica-estudos-2005-pdfs/alternancia-tu-voce-411.pdf |journal=Estudos Lingüísticos |language=Portuguese |volume=XXXIV |pages=362–367 |access-date=10 August 2017 |via=Tu/você alternation in Santa Catarina: a variationist approach}}</ref>

Modern Standard [[European Portuguese]] ({{lang|pt|português padrão}}{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} or {{lang|pt|português continental}}) is based on the Portuguese spoken in the area including and surrounding the cities of [[Coimbra]] and [[Lisbon]], in central Portugal. Standard European Portuguese is also the preferred standard by the Portuguese-speaking African countries. As such, and despite the fact that its speakers are dispersed around the world, Portuguese has only two dialects used for learning: the European and the Brazilian. Some aspects and sounds found in many dialects of Brazil are exclusive to South America, and cannot be found in Europe. The same occur with the Santomean, Mozambican, Bissau-Guinean, Angolan and Cape Verdean dialects, being exclusive to Africa. See [[Portuguese in Africa]].

Audio samples of some dialects and accents of Portuguese are available below.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/hlp/geografia/mapa07.html|title=Audio samples of the dialects of Portuguese|accessdate=12 June 2015|publisher=[[Instituto Camões]]}}</ref> There are some differences between the areas but these are the best approximations possible.

# ''[[Caipira dialect|Caipira]]''&nbsp;– Spoken in the states of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] (most markedly on the countryside and rural areas); southern [[Minas Gerais]], northern [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] and southeastern [[Mato Grosso do Sul]]. Depending on the vision of what constitutes ''caipira'', [[Triângulo Mineiro]], border areas of [[Goiás]] and the remaining parts of Mato Grosso do Sul are included, and the frontier of ''caipira'' in Minas Gerais is expanded further northerly, though not reaching metropolitan [[Belo Horizonte]].

# [[North coast Portuguese|''Cearense'' or ''Costa norte'']]&nbsp;– is a dialect spoken more sharply in the states of Ceará and Piauí. The variant of Ceará includes fairly distinctive traits it shares with the one spoken in Piauí, though, such as distinctive regional phonology and vocabulary (for example, a debuccalization process stronger than that of Portuguese, a different system of the vowel harmony that spans Brazil from ''fluminense'' and ''mineiro'' to ''amazofonia'' but is especially prevalent in ''nordestino'', a very coherent coda sibilant palatalization as those of Portugal and Rio de Janeiro but allowed in fewer environments than in other accents of ''nordestino'', a greater presence of dental stop palatalization to palato-alveolar in comparison to other accents of ''nordestino'', among others, as well as a great number of archaic Portuguese words).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://repositorio.ufc.br/bitstream/riufc/31547/1/2000_art_jlmonteiro.pdf |title=As descrições fonológicas do português do Ceará: de Aguiar a Macambira |first=José Lemos |last=Monteiro |journal=Revista do GELNE |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2000}}</ref><ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Maia |first=Viviane dos Santos |title='Tu vai para onde? ...

# ''Baiano''&nbsp;– Found in [[Bahia]], [[Sergipe]], northern Minas Gerais and border regions with [[Goiás]] and [[Tocantins]]. Similar to ''nordestino'', it has a very characteristic [[Stress timing|syllable-timed rhythm]] and the greatest tendency to pronounce unstressed vowels as open-mid {{IPAblink|ɛ}} and {{IPAblink|ɔ}}.[[File:Portugueselanguagedialects-Brazil (colored).svg|thumb|[[Variety (linguistics)|Variants]] and [[sociolect]]s of Brazilian Portuguese.]]
# [[File:Loudspeaker.svg|11px]] [http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/hlp/geografia/som90.html ''Fluminense'']&nbsp;– A broad dialect with many variants spoken in the states of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Espírito Santo]] and neighboring eastern regions of [[Minas Gerais]]. ''Fluminense'' formed in these previously ''caipira''-speaking areas due to the gradual influence of European migrants, causing many people to distance their speech from their original dialect and incorporate new terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sibila.com.br/english/learn-about-portuguese-language-2/2721|title=Learn about Portuguese language|publisher=Sibila|accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref> ''Fluminense'' is sometimes referred to as ''carioca'', however ''carioca'' is a more specific term referring to the accent of the [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] area by speakers with a ''fluminense'' dialect.
# ''[[Gaúcho dialect|Gaúcho]]''&nbsp;– in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], similar to ''sulista''. There are many distinct accents in Rio Grande do Sul, mainly due to the heavy influx of European immigrants of diverse origins who have settled in colonies throughout the state, and to the proximity to [[Hispanosphere|Spanish-speaking nations]]. The ''gaúcho'' word in itself is a Spanish [[loanword]] into Portuguese of obscure [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Indigenous Amerindian]] origins. [[File:Falantes no mundo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Percentage of worldwide Portuguese speakers per country.]]
# ''[[Mineiro]]''&nbsp;– [[Minas Gerais]] (not prevalent in the [[Triângulo Mineiro]]). As the ''fluminense'' area, its associated region was formerly a sparsely populated land where ''caipira'' was spoken, but [[Minas Gerais#History|the discovery of gold and gems made it the most prosperous Brazilian region]], what attracted Portuguese colonists, commoners from other parts of Brazil and their African slaves. South-southwestern, [[Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais)|southeastern]] and northern areas of the state have fairly distinctive speech, actually approximating to ''caipira'', ''fluminense'' (popularly called, often pejoratively, ''carioca do brejo'', "marsh carioca") and ''baiano'' respectively. Areas including and surrounding [[Belo Horizonte]] have a distinctive accent.
# [[File:Loudspeaker.svg|11px]] [http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/hlp/geografia/som91.html ''Nordestino'']<ref name="ReferenceB">Note: the speaker of this sound file is from Rio de Janeiro, and he is talking about his experience with ''nordestino'' and ''nortista'' accents.</ref>&nbsp;– more marked in the [[Sertão]] (7), where, in the 19th and 20th centuries and especially in the area including and surrounding the ''sertão'' (the dry land after [[Agreste]]) of Pernambuco and southern Ceará, it could sound less comprehensible to speakers of other Portuguese dialects than Galician or [[Rioplatense Spanish]], and nowadays less distinctive from other variants in the metropolitan cities [[Zona da Mata|along the coasts]]. It can be divided in two regional variants, one that includes the northern [[Maranhão]] and southern of [[Piauí]], and other that goes from [[Ceará]] to [[Alagoas]].
# ''Nortista'' or ''amazofonia''&nbsp;– Most of [[Amazon Basin]] states, i.e. [[North Region, Brazil|Northern Brazil]]. Before the 20th century, most people from the ''nordestino'' area fleeing the droughts and their associated poverty settled here, so it has some similarities with the Portuguese dialect there spoken. The speech in and around the cities of [[Belém]] and [[Manaus]] has a more European flavor in phonology, prosody and grammar.
# ''[[Paulistano dialect|Paulistano]]''&nbsp;– Variants spoken around [[Greater São Paulo]] in its maximum definition and more easterly areas of São Paulo state, as well perhaps "educated speech" from anywhere in [[São Paulo (state)|the state of São Paulo]] (where it coexists with ''caipira''). ''Caipira'' is the hinterland sociolect of much of the [[Centro-Sul|Central-Southern half]] of Brazil, nowadays conservative only in the rural areas and associated with them, that has a historically [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|low prestige]] in cities as Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, Belo Horizonte, and until some years ago, in São Paulo itself. [[Sociolinguistics]], or what by times is described as '[[linguistic discrimination|linguistic prejudice]]', often correlated with [[Class discrimination|classism]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=O MEC, o "português errado" e a linguistica... |url=http://www.imprenca.com/2011/05/mec-portugues-errado-e-linguistica.html |date=2011-05-17 |website=Imprenca.com |language=Portuguese |trans-title=MEC, "wrong Portuguese" and linguistics…  |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419090139/http://www.imprenca.com/2011/05/mec-portugues-errado-e-linguistica.html |archive-date=19 April 2012 |access-date=23 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Cartilha do MEC ensina erro de Português |url=http://www.saindodamatrix.com.br/archives/2011/05/cartilha_do_mec.html |date=18 May 2011 |website=Saindo da Matrix |language=Portuguese |trans-title=MEC primer teaches Portuguese error |access-date=23 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jornaldebeltrao.com.br/noticia/63414/livro-do-mec-ensina-o-portugues-errado-ou-apenas-valoriza-as-formas-linguisticas |title=Livro do MEC ensina o português errado ou apenas valoriza as formas linguísticas?|work=Jornal de Beltrão |language= pt |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> is a polemic topic in the entirety of the country since the times of [[Adoniran Barbosa#Musical production|Adoniran Barbosa]]. Also, the "Paulistano" accent was heavily influenced by the presence of immigrants in the city of São Paulo, especially the Italians.
# ''Sertanejo''&nbsp;– [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-Western states]], and also much of [[Tocantins]] and [[Rondônia]]. It is closer to ''mineiro'', ''caipira'', ''nordestino'' or ''nortista'' depending on the location.
# ''Sulista''&nbsp;– The variants spoken in the areas between the northern regions of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and southern regions of São Paulo state, encompassing most of [[South Region, Brazil|southern Brazil]]. The city of [[Curitiba]] does have a fairly distinct accent as well, and a relative majority of speakers around and in [[Florianópolis]] also speak this variant (many speak ''florianopolitano'' or ''manezinho da ilha'' instead, related to the European Portuguese dialects spoken in [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]]). Speech of northern Paraná is closer to that of inland São Paulo.
# ''[[Florianopolitan dialect|Florianopolitano]]''&nbsp;– Variants heavily influenced by European Portuguese spoken in [[Florianópolis]] city (due to a heavy immigration movement from Portugal, mainly its [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|insular regions]]) and much of its metropolitan area, [[Grande Florianópolis]], said to be a continuum between those whose speech most resemble ''sulista'' dialects and those whose speech most resemble ''fluminense'' and European ones, called, often pejoratively, ''manezinho da ilha''.
# ''[[Carioca]]''&nbsp;– Not a dialect, but [[sociolect]]s of the ''fluminense'' variant spoken in an area roughly corresponding to [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]]. It appeared after locals came in contact with the Portuguese aristocracy amidst the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Portuguese royal family fled]] in the early 19th century. There is actually a continuum between Vernacular countryside accents and the ''carioca'' sociolect, and the educated speech (in Portuguese ''norma culta'', which most closely resembles other Brazilian Portuguese standards but with marked recent Portuguese influences, the nearest ones among the country's dialects along ''florianopolitano''), so that not all people native to the state of Rio de Janeiro speak the said sociolect, but most ''carioca'' speakers will use the standard variant not influenced by it that is rather uniform around Brazil depending on context (emphasis or formality, for example).
# ''Brasiliense''&nbsp;– used in [[Brasília]] and its metropolitan area.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sotaque branco |url=http://www.meiamaratonadebrasilia.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=73&Itemid=71 |publisher=Meia Maratona Internacional CAIXA de Brasília |language=Portuguese |trans-title=White accent |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517200320/http://www.meiamaratonadebrasilia.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=73&Itemid=71 |archive-date=17 May 2016 |access-date=25 September 2012}}</ref> It is not considered a dialect, but more of a regional variant&nbsp;– often deemed to be closer to ''fluminense'' than the dialect commonly spoken in most of Goiás, ''sertanejo''.
# ''Arco do desflorestamento'' or ''[[:pt:Dialeto da serra amazônica|serra amazônica]]''&nbsp;–  Known in its region as the "accent of the migrants", it has similarities with ''caipira'', ''sertanejo'' and often ''sulista'' that make it differing from ''amazofonia'' (in the opposite group of Brazilian dialects, in which it is placed along ''nordestino'', ''baiano'', ''mineiro'' and ''fluminense''). It is the most recent dialect, which appeared by the settlement of families from various other Brazilian regions attracted by the cheap land offer in recently [[Deforestation|deforested]] areas.<ref>{{Cite web |title=O Que É?

Differences between dialects are mostly of [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] and [[vocabulary]], but between the Brazilian dialects and other dialects, especially in their most colloquial forms, there can also be some grammatical differences. The [[Portuguese creole|Portuguese-based creoles]] spoken in various parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas are independent languages.

[[File:Portugués_europeo.png|thumb|left|200px|Map highlighting the different [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] within the [[Portuguese Republic]]]]
Portuguese, like [[Catalan language|Catalan]], preserved the stressed vowels of [[Vulgar Latin]] which became diphthongs in most other Romance languages; cf. Port., Cat., Sard. ''[[wikt:pedra|pedra]]'' ; Fr. ''{{wiktfr|pierre}}'', Sp. ''{{wiktes|piedra}}'', It. ''{{wiktit|pietra}}'', Ro. ''{{wiktro|piatră}}'', from Lat. ''{{wiktla|petra}}'' ("stone"); or Port. ''{{wiktpt|fogo}}'', Cat. ''{{wiktca|foc}}'', Sard. ''{{wiktsc|fogu}}''; Sp. ''{{wiktes|fuego}}'', It. ''{{wiktit|fuoco}}'', Fr. ''{{wiktfr|feu}}'', Ro. ''{{wiktro|foc}}'', from Lat. ''{{wiktla|focus}}'' ("fire"). Another characteristic of early Portuguese was the loss of [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]] ''l'' and ''n'', sometimes followed by the merger of the two surrounding vowels, or by the insertion of an [[epenthesis|epenthetic vowel]] between them: cf. Lat. ''{{wiktla|salire}}'' ("to exit"), ''{{wiktla|tenere}}'' ("to have"), ''{{wiktla|catena}}'' ("jail"), Port. ''{{wiktpt|sair}}'', ''{{wiktpt|ter}}'', ''{{wiktpt|cadeia}}''.

When the [[elision|elided]] consonant was ''n'', it often [[nasalization|nasalized]] the preceding vowel: cf. Lat. ''{{wiktla|manum}}'' ("hand"), ''{{wiktla|ranam}}'' ("frog"), ''{{wiktla|bonum}}'' ("good"), Old Portuguese ''{{wiktpt|mão}}'', ''{{wiktpt|rãa}}'', ''{{wiktpt|bõo}}'' (Portuguese: ''{{wiktpt|mão}}'', ''{{wiktpt|rã}}'', ''{{wiktpt|bom}}''). This process was the source of most of the language's distinctive nasal diphthongs. In particular, the Latin endings ''-anem'', ''{{wiktla|-anum}}'' and ''{{wiktla|-onem}}'' became ''{{wiktpt|-ão}}'' in most cases, cf. Lat. ''{{wiktla|canis}}'' ("dog"), ''{{wiktla|germanus}}'' ("brother"), ''{{wiktla|ratio}}'' ("reason") with Modern Port. ''{{wiktpt|cão}}'', ''{{wiktpt|irmão}}'', ''{{wiktpt|razão}}'', and their plurals ''-anes'', ''-anos'', ''-ones'' normally became ''-ães'', ''-ãos'', ''-ões'', cf. ''cães'', ''irmãos'', ''razões''.

The Portuguese language is the only [[Romance language]] that has preserved the clitic case [[mesoclisis]]: cf. {{lang|pt|dar-te-ei}} (I'll give thee), {{lang|pt|amar-te-ei}} (I'll love you), {{lang|pt|contactá-los-ei}} (I'll contact them). Like [[Galician language|Galician]], it also retains the Latin synthetic [[pluperfect]] tense: {{lang|pt|eu estivera}} (I had been), {{lang|pt|eu vivera}} (I had lived), {{lang|pt|vós vivêreis}} (you had lived).<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GILmCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA49 |chapter=On the Italian, Latin, and Portuguese Temporal Systems |title=Tense and Aspect: From Semantics to Morphosyntax |isbn=978-0-19-509193-9|last1=Giorgi|first1=Alessandra|last2=Pianesi|first2=Fabio|year=1997}}</ref> [[Romanian language|Romanian]] also has this tense, but uses the -s- form.

[[File:Heranca linguistico-cultural Sueva Portugal-Galiza.jpg|thumb|left| Incidence of Germanic toponymy in Portugal-Galicia]]

Most of the lexicon of Portuguese is derived, directly or through other Romance languages, from Latin. Nevertheless, because of its original [[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]] and Celtic [[Gallaeci]]an heritage, and the later participation of Portugal in the [[Age of Discovery]], it has a relevant number of words from the ancient [[Hispano-Celtic languages|Hispano-Celtic group]]<ref name="Colera 2007 p.750 quote" /> and adopted [[loanword]]s from other languages around the world.

A number of Portuguese words can still be traced to the [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|pre-Roman inhabitants of Portugal]], which included the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]]. Most of these words derived from the [[Hispano-Celtic]] [[Gallaecian language]] of northwestern Iberia, and are very often shared with [[Galician language|Galician]] since both languages have the same origin in the medieval language of Galician-Portuguese. A few of these words existed in Latin as loanwords from other [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] sources, often [[Gaulish]]. Altogether these are over 2,000 words, some verbs and toponymic names of towns, rivers, utensils and plants.

In the 5th century, the Iberian Peninsula (the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Hispania]]) was conquered by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]]. As they adopted the Roman civilization and language, however, these people contributed with some 500 
[[Germanic languages|Germanic]] words to the lexicon. Many of these words are related to warfare&nbsp;– such as {{lang|pt|espora}} 'spur', {{lang|pt|estaca}} 'stake', and {{lang|pt|guerra}} 'war', from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''*spaúra'', ''*stakka'', and ''*wirro'' respectively; the natural world i.e. {{lang|pt|suino}} 'swine' from ''*sweina'', {{lang|pt|gavião}} 'hawk' from ''*gabilans'', {{lang|pt|vaga}} 'wave' from ''*vigan''' human emotions such as {{lang|pt|orgulho}} or {{lang|pt|orgulhoso}} ('pride', 'proud') from Old Germanic ''*urguol'' or verbs like {{lang|pt|gravar}} 'to craft, record, graft' from ''*graba'' or {{lang|pt|esmagar}} 'to squeeze, quash, grind' from Suebian ''*magōn'' or {{lang|pt|esfarrapar}} 'to shred' from ''*harpō''. The [[Germanic languages]] influence also exists in [[toponymic surname]]s and [[patronymic surname]]s borne by Visigoth sovereigns and their descendants, and it dwells on placenames such as [[Ermesinde]], [[Esposende]] and [[Resende, Portugal|Resende]] where ''sinde'' and ''sende'' are derived from the Germanic ''sinths'' (military expedition) and in the case of Resende, the prefix ''re'' comes from Germanic ''reths'' 'council'. Other examples of Portuguese names, surnames and town names of Germanic [[toponymic]] origin include Henrique, [[Henriques (surname)|Henriques]], Vermoim, Mandim, Calquim, Baguim, Gemunde, Guetim, Sermonde and many more, are quite common mainly in the old [[Suebi]] and later [[Visigothic]] dominated regions, covering today's Northern half of Portugal and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].

Between the 9th and early 13th centuries, Portuguese acquired some 400 to 600 words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] by influence of [[al-Andalus|Moorish Iberia]]. They are often recognizable by the initial [[Definite article in Arabic|Arabic article ''a(l)-'']], and include common words such as {{lang|pt|aldeia}} 'village' from الضيعة ''alḍaiʿa''  {{lang|pt|alface}} 'lettuce' from الخس ''alkhass'', {{lang|pt|armazém}} 'warehouse' from المخزن ''almakhzan'', and {{lang|pt|azeite}} 'olive oil' from الزيت ''azzait''.

[[File:State_Central_Library,_Goa_Dec_27,_2012_14.JPG|thumb|left|A sign at [[Goa State Central Library|Goa Central Library]], in [[Panaji]], India]]

Starting in the 15th century, the Portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from Asian languages. For instance, {{lang|pt|catana}} 'cutlass' from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''katana'', {{lang|pt|chá}} 'tea' from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''[[Tea#Etymology|chá]]'', and {{lang|pt|canja}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Canja |url=https://dicionario.priberam.org/Canja |website=Dicionário Priberam}}</ref> 'chicken-soup, piece of cake' from [[Malay language|Malay]].

From the 16th to the 19th centuries, because of the role of Portugal as intermediary in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and the establishment of large Portuguese colonies in Angola, Mozambique, and Brazil, Portuguese acquired several words of African and [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|Amerind]] origin, especially names for most of the animals and plants found in those territories. While those terms are mostly used in the former colonies, many became current in European Portuguese as well. From [[Kimbundu language|Kimbundu]], for example, came ''kifumate'' > {{lang|pt|cafuné}} 'head caress' (Brazil), ''kusula'' > {{lang|pt|caçula}} 'youngest child' (Brazil), {{lang|pt|marimbondo}} 'tropical wasp' (Brazil), and ''kubungula'' > {{lang|pt|bungular}} 'to dance like a wizard' (Angola). From South America came {{lang|pt|batata}} '[[potato]]', from [[Taíno language|Taino]]; {{lang|pt|ananás}} and {{lang|pt|abacaxi}}, from [[Tupi–Guarani languages|Tupi–Guarani]] ''naná'' and [[Tupi language|Tupi]] ''ibá cati'', respectively (two species of [[pineapple]]), and {{lang|pt|pipoca}} '[[popcorn]]' from Tupi and {{lang|pt|tucano}} '[[toucan]]' from [[Guarani language|Guarani]] ''tucan''.

Finally, it has received a steady influx of loanwords from other European languages, especially French and [[English language|English]]. These are by far the most important languages when referring to loanwords. There are many examples such as: {{lang|pt|colchete}}/{{lang|pt|crochê}} 'bracket'/'crochet', {{lang|pt|paletó}} 'jacket', {{lang|pt|batom}} 'lipstick', and {{lang|pt|filé}}/{{lang|pt|filete}} 'steak'/'slice', {{lang|pt|rua}} 'street' respectively, from French {{lang|fr|crochet}}, {{lang|fr|paletot}}, {{lang|fr|bâton}}, {{lang|fr|filet}}, {{lang|fr|rue}}; and {{lang|pt|bife}} 'steak', {{lang|pt|futebol}}, {{lang|pt|revólver}}, {{lang|pt|stock}}/{{lang|pt|estoque}}, {{lang|pt|folclore}}, from English "beef", "football", "revolver", "stock", "folklore".

Examples from other European languages: {{lang|pt|macarrão}} 'pasta', {{lang|pt|piloto}} 'pilot', {{lang|pt|carroça}} 'carriage', and {{lang|pt|barraca}} 'barrack', from Italian {{lang|it|maccherone}}, {{lang|it|pilota}}, {{lang|it|carrozza}}, and {{lang|it|baracca}}; {{lang|pt|melena}} 'hair lock', {{lang|pt|fiambre}} 'wet-cured ham' (in Portugal, in contrast with ''presunto'' 'dry-cured ham' from Latin ''prae-exsuctus'' 'dehydrated') or 'canned ham' (in Brazil, in contrast with non-canned, wet-cured ''presunto cozido'' and dry-cured ''presunto cru''), or ''castelhano'' 'Castilian', from Spanish ''melena'' 'mane', ''fiambre'' and ''castellano.''

{{Main|Iberian Romance languages|Galician-Portuguese|Comparison of Spanish and Portuguese}}

Portuguese belongs to the [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian]] branch of the [[Romance language]]s, and it has special ties with the following members of this group:
* [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Fala language|Fala]] and [[Riverense Portuñol language|''portunhol do pampa'']] (the way ''riverense'' and its sibling dialects are referred to in Portuguese), its closest relatives.
* [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Extremaduran language|Extremaduran]] and [[Cantabrian dialect|Cantabrian]] ([[Astur-Leonese languages]]). Mirandese is the only recognised regional language spoken in Portugal (beside Portuguese, the only official language in Portugal).
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Caló language|''calão'']] (the way ''caló'', language of the Iberian [[Romani people|Romani]], is referred to in Portuguese).

Portuguese and other Romance languages (namely [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]) are moderately mutually intelligible, and share considerable similarities in both vocabulary and grammar. Portuguese speakers will usually need some formal study before attaining strong comprehension in those Romance languages, and vice versa. However, Portuguese and Galician are [[mutually intelligible]], and Spanish is [[Mutual intelligibility#Asymmetric intelligibility|asymmetrically comprehensible]] to Portuguese speakers. Given that Portuguese has a larger phonemic inventory than Spanish, Portuguese is still considerably intelligible (if spoken slowly and without jargon) to most Spanish speakers, owing to their genealogical proximity and shared genealogical history as [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian]] ([[Ibero-Romance languages]]), historical contact between speakers and mutual influence, shared [[areal features]] as well as modern lexical, structural, and grammatical similarity (89%) between them.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Jensen

[[Portuñol]]/Portunhol, a form of [[code-switching]], has a more lively use and is more readily mentioned in popular culture in South America. Said code-switching is not to be confused with the Portuñol spoken on the borders of Brazil with Uruguay ({{lang|pt|dialeto do pampa}}) and Paraguay ({{lang|pt|dialeto dos [[Brasiguayos|brasiguaios]]}}), and of Portugal with Spain ({{lang|pt|[[barranquenho]]}}), that are Portuguese dialects spoken natively by thousands of people, which have been heavily influenced by Spanish.<ref name="Lipski">{{Cite conference |last=Lipski |first=John M |year=2006 |editor-last=Face |editor-first=Timothy L |editor2-last=Klee |editor2-first=Carol A |title=Too close for comfort? the genesis of 'portuñol/portunhol' |url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/hls/8/paper1251.pdf |pages=1–22 |access-date=21 June 2015 |journal=Selected Proceedings of the 8th Hispanic Linguistics Symposium}}</ref>

Portuguese and Spanish are the only Ibero-Romance languages, and perhaps the only Romance languages with such thriving inter-language forms, in which visible and lively bilingual contact dialects and code-switching have formed, in which functional bilingual communication is achieved through attempting an approximation to the target foreign language (known as 'Portuñol') without a learned acquisition process, but nevertheless facilitates communication. There is an emerging literature focused on such phenomena (including informal attempts of standardization of the linguistic continua and their usage).<ref name="Lipski" />

=== Galician-Portuguese in Spain ===
{{see also|Reintegrationism}}
The closest relative of Portuguese is Galician, which is spoken in the autonomous community (region) and [[historical nationality]] of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (northwestern Spain). The two were at one time a single language, known today as [[Galician-Portuguese]], but they have diverged especially in pronunciation and vocabulary due to the political separation of Portugal from Galicia. There is, however, still a linguistic continuity consisting of the variant of Galician referred to as ''galego-português baixo-limiao'', which is spoken in several Galician villages between the municipalities of [[Entrimo]] and [[Lobios]] and the transborder region of the [[Peneda-Gerês National Park|natural park of Peneda-Gerês/Xurês]]. It is "considered a rarity, a living vestige of the medieval language that ranged from [[Cantabria]] to [[Mondego River|Mondego]] [...]".<ref name="agal-gz.or">{{Citation |title=A Fala Galego-Portuguesa da Baixa-Limia e Castro Laboreiro |url=http://www.agal-gz.org/pdf/falabaixalimia.pdf |trans-title=The Galician-Portuguese Speech of Baixa-Limia and Castro Laboreiro |language=Portuguese |access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref>
As reported by UNESCO, due to the pressure of the Spanish language on the standard official version of the Galician language, the Galician language was on the verge of disappearing.<ref name="agal-gz.or" /> According to the UNESCO philologist Tapani Salminen, the proximity to Portuguese protects Galician.<ref>{{Cite news |date=20 February 2009 |title=O galego deixa de ser unha das linguas 'en perigo' para a Unesco |language=Galician |trans-title=Galician is no longer one of the "endangered" languages for Unesco |work=Galicia Hoxe |url=http://www.galiciahoxe.com/mare/gh/galego-deixa-ser-unha-das-linguas-perigo-unesco/idNoticia-397878 |access-date=30 May 2015}}</ref>
Nevertheless, the core vocabulary and grammar of Galician are still noticeably closer to Portuguese than to those of Spanish. In particular, like Portuguese, it uses the future subjunctive, the personal infinitive, and the synthetic pluperfect. Mutual intelligibility (estimated at 90% by R. A. Hall, Jr., 1989)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=glg |title=Galician |publisher=Ethnologue |accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref> is excellent between Galicians and northern Portuguese. Many linguists consider [[Galician language|Galician]] to be a co-dialect of the Portuguese language.

Another member of the Galician-Portuguese group, most commonly thought of as a Galician dialect, is spoken in the [[Galician-Asturian|Eonavian]] region in a western strip in [[Asturias]] and the westernmost parts of the provinces of [[Province of León|León]] and [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]], along the frontier with Galicia, between the [[Eo (river)|Eo]] and [[Navia (river)|Navia]] rivers (or more exactly Eo and Frexulfe rivers). It is called ''eonaviego'' or ''gallego-asturiano'' by its speakers.

The Fala language, known by its speakers as ''xalimés'', ''mañegu'', ''a fala de Xálima'' and ''chapurráu'' and in Portuguese as ''a fala de Xálima'', ''a fala da Estremadura'', ''o galego da Estremadura'', ''valego'' or ''galaico-estremenho'', is another descendant of Galician-Portuguese, spoken by a small number of people in the Spanish towns of [[Valverde del Fresno]] (''Valverdi du Fresnu''), [[Eljas]] (''As Ellas'') and [[San Martín de Trevejo]] (''Sa Martín de Trevellu'') in the autonomous community of [[Extremadura]], near the border with Portugal.

There are a number of other places in Spain in which the native language of the common people is a descendant of the Galician-Portuguese group, such as [[La Alamedilla]], [[Cedillo]] (''Cedilho''), [[Herrera de Alcántara]] (''Ferreira d'Alcântara'') and [[Olivenza]] (''Olivença''), but in these municipalities, what is spoken is actually Portuguese, not disputed as such in the mainstream.

The diversity of dialects of the Portuguese language is known since the time of medieval Portuguese-Galician language when it coexisted with the Lusitanian-Mozarabic dialect, spoken in the south of Portugal. The dialectal diversity becomes more evident in the work of Fernão d'Oliveira, in the ''Grammatica da Lingoagem Portuguesa'', (1536), where he remarks that the people of Portuguese regions of Beira, Alentejo, Estremadura, and Entre Douro e Minho, all speak differently from each other. Also Contador d'Argote (1725) distinguishes three main varieties of dialects: the local dialects, the dialects of time, and of profession (work jargon). Of local dialects he highlights five main dialects: the dialect of Estremadura, of Entre-Douro e Minho, of Beira, of Algarve and of Trás-os-Montes. He also makes reference to the overseas dialects, the rustic dialects, the poetic dialect and that of prose.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jerónimo Cantador de Argote e a Dialectologia Portuguesa (continuação) |url=http://lusografias.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/jeronimo-cantador-de-argote-e-a-dialectologia-portuguesa-continuacao/ |date=2008-08-27 |website=Lusografias |language=Portuguese |access-date=30 May 2015}}</ref>

In the kingdom of Portugal, ''Ladinho'' (or ''Lingoagem Ladinha'') was the name given to the pure Portuguese romance language, without any mixture of Aravia or Gerigonça Judenga.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/diccionariodalin02morauoft|page=[https://archive.org/details/diccionariodalin02morauoft/page/140 140]|quote=aravia.|title=Diccionario da lingua portugueza|publisher=Na typ. de M.

In a historical perspective the Portuguese language was never just one dialect. Just like today there is a standard Portuguese (actually two) among the several dialects of Portuguese, in the past there was Galician-Portuguese as the "standard", coexisting with other dialects.

Portuguese has provided [[loanword]]s to many languages, such as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Manado Malay]], [[Malayalam]], [[Sri Lanka Tamils (native)|Sri Lankan Tamil]] and [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[English (language)|English]], [[Hindi]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Tetum language|Tetum]], [[Tsonga language|Xitsonga]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Lanc-Patuá creole|Lanc-Patuá]], [[Esan people#Language|Esan]], [[Bandar Abbas|Bandari]] (spoken in Iran) and [[Sranan Tongo]] (spoken in Suriname). It left a strong influence on the ''[[Old Tupi|língua brasílica]]'', a [[Tupi–Guarani language]], which was the most widely spoken in Brazil until the 18th century, and on the language spoken around [[Sikka Regency|Sikka]] in [[Flores]] Island, [[Indonesia]]. In nearby [[Larantuka]], Portuguese is used for prayers in [[Holy Week]] rituals.
The Japanese–Portuguese dictionary ''[[Nippo Jisho]]'' (1603) was the first dictionary of Japanese in a European language, a product of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary activity in Japan. Building on the work of earlier Portuguese missionaries, the ''[[Dictionarium Anamiticum, Lusitanum et Latinum]]'' (Annamite–Portuguese–Latin dictionary) of [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] (1651) introduced the modern [[Vietnamese alphabet|orthography of Vietnamese]], which is based on the orthography of 17th-century Portuguese. The [[Romanization]] of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was also influenced by the Portuguese language (among others), particularly regarding [[List of common Chinese surnames|Chinese surnames]]; one example is ''Mei''. During 1583–88 [[Italians|Italian]] [[Jesuits]] [[Michele Ruggieri]] and [[Matteo Ricci]] created a Portuguese–Chinese dictionary&nbsp;– the first ever European–Chinese dictionary.<ref name=camus>{{cite web|url=http://www.riccimac.org/doc/JesuitsJourneys.pdf|title=Jesuits' Journeys in Chinese Studies|last=Camus|first=Yves|accessdate=12 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924090942/http://www.riccimac.org/doc/JesuitsJourneys.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref><ref name="ricciDict">''Dicionário Português–Chinês : Pu Han ci dian: Portuguese–Chinese dictionary'', by Michele Ruggieri, Matteo Ricci; edited by John W.

For instance, as [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese merchants]] were presumably the first to introduce the [[sweet orange]] in Europe, in several modern [[Indo-European languages]] the fruit has been named after them. Some examples are Albanian ''[[wikt:portokall#Albanian|portokall]]'', Bosnian (archaic) ''portokal'', ''prtokal'', Bulgarian [[wikt:портокал#Bulgarian|портокал]] (''portokal''), Greek [[wikt:πορτοκάλι#Greek|πορτοκάλι]] (''portokáli''), [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] ''{{transl|mk|portokal}}'', Persian [[wikt:پرتقال#Persian|پرتقال]] (''porteghal''), and Romanian ''[[wikt:portocală#Romanian|portocală]]''.<ref name="plantname">{{cite web |title=Multilingual Multiscript Plant Name Database: Sorting Citrus Names |url=http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/Sorting/Citrus_2.html|publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] <http://www.search.unimelb.edu.au> |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="OstergrenBosse2011">{{cite book |author1=Ostergren, Robert C.  |author2=Le Bosse, Mathias  |name-list-style=amp |title=The Europeans, Second Edition: A Geography of People, Culture, and Environment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-1fwix23zMC&pg=PA129 |year= 2011 |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |isbn=978-1-60918-140-6 |page=129}}</ref> Related names can be found in other languages,<!--"[[Amharic language|Amharic]] birtukan": NOT in sources--> such as Arabic [[wikt:البرتقال#Arabic|البرتقال]] (''burtuqāl''), [[Georgian language|Georgian]] [[wikt:ფორთოხალი#Georgian|ფორთოხალი]] (''p'ort'oxali''), Turkish ''[[wikt:portakal#Turkish|portakal]]'' and [[Amharic]] ''birtukan''.<ref name="plantname" /> Also, in [[Regional Italian|southern Italian dialects]] (e.g. [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]]), an orange is ''[[:wikt:portogallo|portogallo]]'' or ''[[:wikt:it:purtuallo|purtuallo]]'', literally "(the) Portuguese (one)", in contrast to [[standard Italian]] ''arancia''.

Beginning in the 16th century, the extensive contacts between Portuguese travelers and settlers, African and Asian slaves, and local populations led to the appearance of many [[pidgin]]s with varying amounts of Portuguese influence. As each of these pidgins became the mother tongue of succeeding generations, they evolved into fully fledged [[creole language]]s, which remained in use in many parts of Asia, Africa and South America until the 18th century. Some Portuguese-based or Portuguese-influenced creoles are still spoken today, by over 3 million people worldwide, especially people of partial [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry.

{{Contains special characters|IPA}}
[[File:WIKITONGUES-_Sara_speaking_Portuguese.webm|thumb|Sara, a native speaker of [[European Portuguese]]]]
[[File:2JOB Brasilândia.ogg|thumb|Spoken [[Brazilian Portuguese]]]]

Portuguese phonology is similar to those of languages such as [[French phonology|French]] (especially [[Quebec French phonology|that of Quebec]]), the [[Gallo-Italic languages]], [[Occitan phonology|Occitan]], [[Catalan phonology|Catalan]] and [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], unlike [[Spanish phonology|that of Spanish]], which is similar to those of [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] and the [[Neapolitan language|Southern Italian dialects]]. Some would describe the phonology of Portuguese as a blend of [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] (e.g. [[French language|French]]) and the [[Gallo-Italic languages|languages of northern Italy]] (especially [[Genoese dialect|Genoese]]), but with a deeper [[Celtic language|Celtic]] [[substratum]].<ref>''Handbook of the International Phonetic Association'' pp.&nbsp;126–130</ref><ref name="Gramatica 2007" />

There is a maximum of 9 oral vowels, 2 semivowels and 21 consonants; though some varieties of the language have fewer phonemes. There are also five [[nasal vowel]]s, which some linguists regard as allophones of the oral vowels.

=== Vowels ===
[[File:European Portuguese vowel chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Chart of monophthongs of the Portuguese of Lisbon, with its {{IPA|/ɐ, ɐ̃/}} in central [[schwa]] position.]]

Like [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[German language|German]], Portuguese uses vowel quality to contrast stressed syllables with unstressed syllables. Unstressed isolated vowels tend to be [[vowel height|raised]] and sometimes centralized.

=== Consonants ===

'''Phonetic notes'''
* Semivowels contrast with unstressed high vowels in verbal conjugation, as in ''(eu) rio'' {{IPA|/ˈʁi.u/}} and ''(ele) riu'' {{IPA|/ˈʁiw/}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rodrigues|2012|pp=39–40}}</ref> Phonologists discuss whether their nature is vowel or consonant.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bisol|2005|p=123}}</ref>
* In most of Brazil and Angola, the consonant hereafter denoted as {{IPA|/ɲ/}} is realized as a [[nasal palatal approximant]] {{IPAblink|ȷ̃|j̃}}, which [[Nasalization|nasalizes]] the vowel that precedes it: {{IPA|[ˈnĩj̃u]}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|1974|p=8}}</ref><ref>{{Citation

}}</ref>
* {{Harvcoltxt|Bisol|2005|p=122}} proposes that Portuguese possesses labio-velar stops {{IPA|/kʷ/}} and {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}} as additional phonemes rather than sequences of a velar stop and {{IPA|/w/}}.<ref name="labialized velar - Bisol" />
* The consonant hereafter denoted as {{IPA|/ʁ/}} has a variety of realizations depending on dialect. In Europe, it is typically a [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[ʀ]}}; however, a pronunciation as a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}} may be becoming dominant in urban areas. There is also a realization as a [[voiceless uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[χ]}}, and the original pronunciation as an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}} also remains very common in various dialects.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mateus|d'Andrade|2000|pp=5–6, 11}}</ref> A common realization of the word-initial {{IPA|/r/}} in the Lisbon accent is a voiced uvular fricative trill {{IPAblink|ʀ̝}}.<ref name="gr157">{{Harvcoltxt|Grønnum|2005|p=157}}</ref> In Brazil, {{IPA|/ʁ/}} can be [[velar consonant|velar]], [[uvular consonant|uvular]], or [[glottal consonant|glottal]] and may be voiceless unless between voiced sounds.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Barbosa|Albano|2004|p=228}}</ref> It is usually pronounced as a [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}}, a [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} or [[voiceless uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[χ]}}. See also ''[[Guttural R#Portuguese|Guttural R in Portuguese]]''.
* {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} are normally {{lcons|lamino-alveolar}}, as in English. However, a number of dialects in northern Portugal pronounce {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} as [[apico-alveolar]] [[sibilant]]s (sounding somewhat like a soft {{IPA|[ʃ]}} or {{IPA|[ʒ]}}), as in the Romance languages of northern Iberia. A very few northeastern Portugal dialects still maintain the medieval distinction between apical and laminal sibilants (written ''s/ss'' and ''c/ç/z'', respectively).
* As a phoneme, {{IPA|/tʃ/}} occurs only in loanwords, with a tendency for speakers to substitute in {{IPA|/ʃ/}}. However, {{IPA|[tʃ]}} is an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/t/}} before {{IPA|/i/}} in a number of Brazilian dialects. Similarly, {{IPA|[dʒ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/d/}} in the same contexts.
* In northern and central Portugal, the voiced stops ({{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}) are usually lenited to [[fricative]]s {{IPA|[β]}}, {{IPA|[ð]}}, and {{IPA|[ɣ]}}, respectively, except at the beginning of words or after nasal vowels.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Cruz-Ferreira|1995|p=92}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mateus|d'Andrade|2000|p=11}}</ref>

== Grammar ==
{{Main|Portuguese grammar}}

A notable aspect of the grammar of Portuguese is the verb. Morphologically, more verbal inflections from classical Latin have been preserved by Portuguese than by any other major [[Romance language]]. Portuguese and Spanish share very similar grammar. Portuguese also has some grammatical innovations not found in other Romance languages (except Galician and Fala):
* The [[present perfect]] has an iterative sense unique to the Galician-Portuguese language group. It denotes an action or a series of actions that began in the past but expected to occur again in the future. For instance, the sentence ''Tenho tentado falar com ela'' would be translated to "I have been trying to talk to her", not "I have tried to talk to her." On the other hand, the correct translation of "Have you heard the latest news?" is not ''*Tem ouvido a última notícia?'' but ''Ouviu a última notícia?'' since no repetition is implied.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Verbal Periphrases in Romance: Aspect, Actionality, and Grammaticalization |last=Squartini |first=Mario |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |year=1998 |isbn=978-3-11-016160-1 |location=Berlin |oclc=39007172}}</ref>
* [[Vernacular]] Portuguese makes use of the future [[subjunctive mood]], which developed from medieval [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance]]. In modern Spanish and Galician, it has almost entirely fallen into disuse. The future subjunctive appears in dependent clauses that denote a condition that must be fulfilled in the future so that the independent clause will occur. English normally employs the present tense under the same circumstances:

:''Se eu ''for'' eleito presidente, mudarei a lei.''
:If ''I am'' elected president, I will change the law.

:''Quando ''fores'' mais velho, vais entender.''
:When ''you grow'' older, you will understand.
* The personal [[infinitive]] can [[inflection|inflect]] according to its subject in [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]]. It often shows who is expected to perform a certain action. ''É melhor voltares'' "It is better [for you] to go back," ''É melhor voltarmos'' "It is better [for us] to go back." Perhaps for that reason, infinitive clauses replace subjunctive clauses more often in Portuguese than in other Romance languages.
