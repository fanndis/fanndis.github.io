The '''American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009''' ('''ARRA''') ({{USPL|111|5}}), nicknamed the '''Recovery Act''', was a [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus package]] enacted by the [[111th U.S. Congress]] and signed into law by [[President Barack Obama]] in February 2009. Developed in response to the [[Great Recession]], the primary objective of this federal statute was to save existing jobs and create new ones as soon as possible. Other objectives were to provide temporary relief programs for those most affected by the recession and invest in infrastructure, education, health, and renewable energy.

The approximate cost of the economic stimulus package was estimated to be $787 billion at the time of passage, later revised to $831 billion between 2009 and 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Estimated Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on Employment and Economic Output from October 2011 Through December 2011|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/02-22-ARRA.pdf|website=A CBO Report|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|access-date=February 19, 2017|date=February 2012}}</ref> The ARRA's rationale was based on the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian economic theory]] that, during recessions, the government should offset the decrease in private spending with an increase in public spending in order to save jobs and stop further economic deterioration.

Surveys of economists show overwhelming agreement that the stimulus reduced unemployment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Economic Stimulus|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_cw5O9LNJL1oz4Xi|website=IGM Forum|publisher=The Initiative on Global Markets; Chicago Booth|access-date=February 19, 2017|date=February 15, 2012}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> In a 2014 IGM Forum survey, only one economist disagreed that the stimulus had lowered unemployment.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title=Economic Stimulus (revisited)|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/economic-stimulus-revisited|website=IGM Forum|publisher=The Initiative on Global Markets; Chicago Booth|access-date=February 19, 2017|date=July 29, 2014}}</ref> The survey also showed majority support for the notion that the benefits of the stimulus outweighed the costs, with only two economists disagreeing.<ref name=":1" />

The politics around the stimulus was very contentious. On the right, it spurred the [[Tea Party movement]] and may have contributed to Republicans winning the House in the 2010 midterms.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/american-political-history-a-very-short-introduction-9780199340057|title=American Political History: A Very Short Introduction|last=Critchlow|first=Donald|date=2014-12-25|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-934005-7|series=Very Short Introductions|location=Oxford, New York}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783319410326|title=The Obama Presidency and the Politics of Change {{!}} Edward Ashbee {{!}} Palgrave Macmillan|pages=223|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-tea-party-and-the-remaking-of-republican-conservatism-9780190633660|title=The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism|last1=Skocpol|first1=Theda|last2=Williamson|first2=Vanessa|date=2016-09-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-063366-0|location=Oxford, New York|pages=6–7}}</ref> Not a single Republican member of the House voted for the stimulus.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://rowman.com/isbn/9781442261259/debating-the-obama-presidency|title=Debating the Obama Presidency|language=en-us}}</ref> Only three Republican Senators voted for it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0209/18837.html|title=Senate passes $787 billion stimulus bill|last=Rogers|first=David|website=POLITICO|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> On the left, there were criticisms that the stimulus was watered down and did not do enough.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/health-care-reform-and-american-politics-9780190262044?cc=us&lang=en&|title=Health Care Reform and American Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know, 3rd Edition|date=2015-12-28|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-026204-4|edition=Third Edition, New to this|series=What Everyone Needs To Know®|location=Oxford, New York|pages=76}}</ref> Economist Paul Krugman argued that the stimulus was far smaller than the economic crisis warranted.<ref name=":2" />

== Legislative history ==
Both the House and the Senate versions of the bills [http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1877192,00.html#ixzz1Sgy68HdV were primarily written by Democratic Congressional committee leaders and their staffs]. Because work on the bills started before President Obama officially took office on January 20, 2009, top aides to President-Elect Obama held multiple meetings with committee leaders and staffers. On January 10, 2009, President-Elect Obama's administration released a report<ref name="RC">{{Citation | last1 = Romer | first1 = Christina| author-link = Christina Romer | last2 = Bernstein| first2 = Jared | author2-link = Jared Bernstein| title = The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan| date = January 10, 2009| url = http://www.ampo.org/assets/library/184_obama.pdf| access-date =July 7, 2011 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110709043551/http://www.ampo.org/assets/library/184_obama.pdf| archive-date= July 9, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> that provided a preliminary analysis of the impact to jobs of some of the prototypical recovery packages that were being considered.

The House version of the bill, {{USBill|111|H.R.|1}}, was introduced on January 26, 2009.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/floorsummary/floor.html?day=20090126&today=20100630 Legislative Day of January 26, 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610211330/http://clerk.house.gov/floorsummary/floor.html?day=20090126&today=20100630 |date=June  >:) [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]]</ref> chairman, and was co-sponsored by nine other Democrats.

On January 28, 2009, the House passed the bill by a 244–188 vote.<ref name="House vote">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/29/us/politics/29obama.html?hp | title=House Passes Stimulus Plan Despite G.O.P.

=== Senate ===
The Senate version of the bill, {{USBill|111|S.|1}}, was introduced on January 6, 2009, and later substituted as an amendment to the House bill, {{USBill|111|SA|570}}. It was sponsored by [[Harry Reid]], the [[Majority Leader of the United States Senate|Majority Leader]], co-sponsored by 16 other Democrats and [[Joe Lieberman]], an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] who [[Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate|caucused with the Democrats]].

The Senate then began consideration of the bill starting with the $275 billion tax provisions in the week of February 2, 2009.<ref name="Newsday Obama seeks" /> A significant difference between the House version and the Senate version was the inclusion of a one-year extension of revisions to the [[alternative minimum tax]], which added $70 billion to the bill's total.

Republicans proposed several amendments to the bill directed at increasing the share of tax cuts and downsizing spending as well as decreasing the overall price.<ref>See, for example: S.Amdt. 106, S.Amdt. 107, S.Amdt. 108, and S.Amdt. 109</ref> President Obama and Senate Democrats hinted that they would be willing to compromise on Republican suggestions to increase infrastructure spending and to double the housing tax credit proposed from $7,500 to $15,000 and expand its application to all home buyers, not just first-time buyers.<ref>{{cite news | title=Obama Predicts Support From G.O.P. for Stimulus Proposal | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/us/politics/02obama.html?ref=business | work=The New York Times | date=February 2, 2009 | author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg}}</ref>
Other considered amendments included the [[Freedom Act of 2009]], an amendment proposed by [[Senate Finance Committee]] members [[Maria Cantwell]] (D) and [[Orrin Hatch]] (R) to include tax incentives for [[battery electric vehicle|plug-in electric vehicles]].<ref name="Cantwell">[http://cantwell.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=306895 cantwell.senate.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130013720/http://cantwell.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=306895 |date=January 30, 2009 }}</ref>

The Senate called a special Saturday debate session for February 7 at the urging of President Obama. The Senate voted, 61–36 (with 2 not voting) on February 9 to end debate on the bill and advance it to the Senate floor to vote on the bill itself.<ref>{{USSRollCall|111|1|59}}</ref> On February 10, the Senate voted 61–37 (with one not voting)<ref>Senator [[Judd Gregg]] (R) did not vote because, at the time, he was a nominee of the Democratic president to become [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]]. Gregg also did not participate in the cloture vote.</ref>
All the Democrats voted in favor, but only three Republicans voted in favor ([[Susan Collins]], [[Olympia Snowe]], and [[Arlen Specter]]).<ref>{{USSRollCall|111|1|60}}</ref> Specter [[party switching in the United States|switched]] to the Democratic Party later in the year.

=== Comparison of the House, Senate and Conference versions ===
[[File:Barack Obama signs American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on February 17.jpg|thumb|[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] signs the ARRA into law on February 17, 2009 in [[Denver]], Colorado. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] stands behind him.]]

The president is joined by Vice President [[Joe Biden]] and [[Secretary of Transportation]] [[Ray LaHood]].]]
Senate Republicans forced a near unprecedented level of changes (near $150 billion) in the House bill, which had more closely followed the Obama plan. A comparison of the $827 billion economic recovery plan drafted by Senate Democrats with an $820 billion version passed by the House and the final $787 billion conference version shows huge shifts within these similar totals. Additional debt costs would add about $350 billion or more over 10 years. Many provisions were set to expire in two years.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29050187 "Stimulus bill far from perfect, Obama says" NBC News]</ref>

The main funding differences between the Senate bill and the House bill were: More funds for health care in the Senate ($153.3 vs $140 billion), renewable energy programs ($74 vs. $39.4 billion), for home buyers tax credit ($35.5 vs. $2.6 billion), new payments to the elderly and a one-year increase in AMT limits. The House had more funds appropriated for education ($143 vs. $119.1 billion), infrastructure ($90.4 vs. $62 billion) and for aid to low income workers and the unemployed ($71.5 vs. $66.5 billion).<ref name="AJC Stimulus survives" />

* Aid to low income workers and the unemployed
** Senate – $47 billion to provide extended unemployment benefits through December 31, increased by $25 a week, and provide job training; $16.5 billion to increase [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamp]] benefits by 12 percent through fiscal 2011 and issue a one-time bonus payment; $3 billion in temporary welfare payments.

* Direct cash payments
** Senate – $17 billion to give one-time $300 payments to recipients of [[Supplemental Security Income]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], and veterans receiving disability and pensions.
** House – $4 billion to provide a one-time additional Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance payment to the elderly, of $450 for individuals and $630 for married couples.
** Conference – $250 one-time payment to each recipient of Supplemental Security Income, Social Security (Regular & Disability) Insurance, Veterans pension, Railroad Retirement, or State retirement system<ref>Conference report 111-16, Division B Title II 2/13/09</ref>
* Infrastructure
** Senate – $46 billion for transportation projects, including $27 billion for highway and bridge construction and repair and $11.5 billion for mass transit and rail projects; $4.6 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers; $5 billion for public housing improvements; $6.4 billion for clean and drinking water projects.
** House – $47 billion for transportation projects, including $27 billion for highway and bridge construction and repair and $12 billion for mass transit, including $7.5 billion to buy transit equipment such as buses; and $31 billion to build and repair federal buildings and other public infrastructures.
* Health care
** Senate – $21 billion to subsidize the cost of continuing health care insurance for the [[involuntary unemployment|involuntarily unemployed]] under the [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]] program; $87 billion to help states with [[Medicaid]]; $22 billion to modernize health information technology systems; and $10 billion for health research and construction of [[National Institutes of Health]] facilities.
** House – $40 billion to subsidize the cost of continuing health care insurance for the involuntarily unemployed under the COBRA program or provide health care through Medicaid; $87 billion to help states with Medicaid; $20 billion to modernize health information technology systems; $4 billion for preventive care; $1.5 billion for community health centers; $420 million to combat avian flu; $335 million for programs that combat AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis.
** Conference – A 65% COBRA subsidy for 9 months will apply to workers laid off between Sep 1, 2008 and Dec 31, 2009. Those already laid off have 60 days to apply for COBRA.<ref>Conference report 111-16</ref>
* Education
** Senate – $55 billion in state fiscal relief to prevent cuts in education aid and provide block grants; $25 billion to school districts to fund special education and the [[No Child Left Behind]] K–12 law; $14 billion to boost the maximum [[Pell Grant]] by $400 to $5,250; $2 billion for [[Head Start Program|Head Start]].
** House – Similar aid to states and school districts; $21 billion for school modernization; $16 billion to boost the maximum Pell Grant by $500 to $5,350; $2 billion for Head Start.
** Conference – The Conference Report merged most education aid with the State Fiscal Stabilization fund (administered by the Department of Education) and gave power over the funds to each governor under voluminous restrictions. The Governor is "Required" to spend $45 billion of the money on education to restore funding to 2008 levels but the mechanisms to enforce state maintenance of effort at 2005–06 levels are complex and potentially impossible to implement.<ref>Conference report 111-16, 2-13-09, Title 14</ref> Hard hit states such as Nevada cannot possibly find enough funds to get to the 2005–06 state funding levels for education.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/39257837.html |title=ReviewJournal.com – News – Stimulus in Nevada: Raggio presses Reid: 'We can't be required to give what we don't have' |publisher=Lvrj.com |date=February 7, 2009 |access-date=February 18, 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090210113741/http://www.lvrj.com/news/39257837.html| archive-date= February 10, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Some states with no current budget cuts for education, such as Arkansas and North Carolina, may get nothing.<ref>{{cite news |last=Davey |first=Monica |title=States and Cities Angle for Stimulus Cash |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/us/politics/16stimulus.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 16, 2009 |page=A1 |access-date=January 17, 2013}}</ref> This will result in a monumental 50 state legal and political fight over how to re-budget to best take advantage of the federal legislation. Many states will further reduce state funds for education to the 2005–06 minimum so these state resources can be used for other state priorities and the net gain for education will be far less than the total federal appropriation.
* Energy
** Senate – $40 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, including $2.9 billion to weatherize modest-income homes; $4.6 billion for fossil fuel research and development; $6.4 billion to clean up nuclear weapons production sites; $11 billion toward a smart electricity grid to reduce waste; $8.5 billion to subsidize loans for renewable energy projects; and $2 billion for advanced battery systems.
** House – $28.4 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, including $6.2 billion to weatherize homes; $11 billion to fund a smart electricity grid.
* Homeland security
** Senate – $4.7 billion for homeland security programs, including $1 billion for airport screening equipment and $800 million for port security.
** House – $1.1 billion, including $500 million for airport screening equipment.
* Law enforcement
** Senate – $3.5 billion in grants to state and local law enforcement to hire officers and purchase equipment.
** House – Comparable provision.

==== Tax changes ($275 billion) ====
** House – About $145 billion for $500 per-worker, $1,000 per-couple tax credits in 2009 and 2010. For the last half of 2009, workers could expect to see about $20 a week less withheld from their paychecks starting around June. Millions of Americans who don't make enough money to pay federal income taxes could file returns next year and receive checks. Individuals making more than $75,000 and couples making more than $150,000 would receive reduced amounts.
** Senate – The credit would phase out at incomes of $70,000 for individuals and couples making more than $140,000 and phase out more quickly, reducing the cost to $140 billion.
** Conference – Tax Credit reduced to $400 per worker and $800 per couple in 2009 and 2010 and phaseout begins at $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for joint filers. Note retirees with no wages get nothing.<ref name="handwritten1">House Conference report 111-? Final partially handwritten report released by Nancy Pelosi's Office 2/13/09</ref>
* [[Alternative minimum tax]]
** House – No provision.
** Senate – About $70 billion to prevent 24 million taxpayers from paying the alternative minimum tax in 2009. The tax was designed to make sure wealthy taxpayers can't use credits and deductions to avoid paying any taxes or paying at a far lower rate than would otherwise be possible. But it was never indexed to inflation, so critics now contend it taxes people it was not intended to. Congress addresses it each year, usually in the fall.
** Conference – Includes a one-year increase in AMT floor to $70,950 for joint filers for 2009.<ref name="handwritten1" />
* Expanded child credit
** House – $18.3 billion to give greater access to the $1,000 per-child tax credit for low income workers in 2009 and 2010. Under current law, workers must make at least $12,550 to receive any portion of the credit. The change eliminates the floor, meaning more workers who pay no federal income taxes could receive checks.
** Senate – Sets a new income threshold of $8,100 to receive any portion of the credit, reducing the cost to $7.5 billion.
** Conference – The income floor for refunds was set at $3,000 for 2009 & 2010.<ref name="conference1">House Conference report 111-16  2/13/09</ref>
* Expanded earned income tax credit
** House – $4.7 billion to increase the [[earned income tax credit]] – which provides money to low income workers – for families with at least three children.
** Senate – Same.
* Expanded college credit
** House – $13.7 billion to provide a $2,500 expanded tax credit for college tuition and related expenses for 2009 and 2010. The credit is phased out for couples making more than $160,000.
** Senate – Reduces the amount that can be refunded to low-income families that pay no income taxes, lowering the cost to $13 billion.
* Homebuyer credit
** House – $2.6 billion to repeal a requirement that a $7,500 first-time homebuyer tax credit be paid back over time for homes purchased from Jan 1 to July 1, unless the home is sold within three years. The credit is phased out for couples making more than $150,000.
** Senate – Doubles the credit to $15,000 for homes purchased for a year after the bill takes effect, increasing the cost to $35.5 billion.
** Conference – $8,000 credit for all homes bought between 1/1/2009 and 12/1/2009 and repayment provision repealed for homes purchased in 2009 and held more than three years.<ref name="conference1" />
* Home energy credit
** House – $4.3 billion to provide an expanded credit to homeowners who make their homes more energy-efficient in 2009 and 2010. Homeowners could recoup 30 percent of the cost up to $1,500 of numerous projects, such as installing energy-efficient windows, doors, furnaces and air conditioners.
** Senate – Same.
** Conference – Same.
* Unemployment
** House – No similar provision.
** Senate – $4.7 billion to exclude from taxation the first $2,400 a person receives in unemployment compensation benefits in 2009.
** Conference – Same as Senate
* Bonus depreciation
** House – $5 billion to extend a provision allowing businesses buying equipment such as computers to speed up its depreciation through 2009.
** Senate – Similar.
* Money-losing companies
** House – $15 billion to allow companies to use current losses to offset profits made in the previous five years, instead of two, making them eligible for [[tax refund]]s.
** Senate – Allows companies to use more of their losses to offset previous profits, increasing the cost to $19.5 billion.

* Government contractors
** House – Repeal a law that takes effect in 2011, requiring government agencies to withhold three percent of payments to contractors to help ensure they pay their tax bills. Repealing the law would cost $11 billion over 10 years, in part because the government could not earn interest by holding the money throughout the year.
** Senate – Delays the law from taking effect until 2012, reducing the cost to $291 million.
* Energy production
** House – $13 billion to extend tax credits for renewable energy production.
** Senate – Same.
** Conference – Extension is to 2014.
* Repeal bank credit
** House – Repeal a Treasury provision that allowed firms that buy money-losing banks to use more of the losses as tax credits to offset the profits of the merged banks for tax purposes. The change would increase taxes on the merged banks by $7 billion over 10 years.
** Senate – Same.

== Buy American provision ==
ARRA included a [[Protectionism|protectionist]] 'Buy American' provision, which imposed a general requirement that any public building or public works project funded by the new stimulus package must use only iron, steel and other manufactured goods produced in the United States.

A May 15, 2009, ''Washington Post'' article reported that the 'Buy American' provision of the stimulus package caused outrage in the Canadian business community, and that the government in Canada "retaliated" by enacting its own restrictions on trade with the U.S.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/14/AR2009051404241_pf.html | title=Trade Wars Brewing In Economic Malaise | work=The Washington Post | date=May 15, 2009 | first1=Anthony | last1=Faiola | first2=Lori | last2=Montgomery | access-date=April 23, 2010}}</ref>  On June 6, 2009, delegates at the [[Federation of Canadian Municipalities]] conference passed a resolution that would potentially shut out U.S. bidders from Canadian city contracts, in order to help show support for Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]]'s opposition to the "Buy American" provision. [[Sherbrooke]] Mayor [[Jean Perrault]], president of the federation, stated, "This U.S. protectionist policy is hurting Canadian firms, costing Canadian jobs and damaging Canadian efforts to grow in the world-wide recession." On February 16, 2010, the United States and Canada agreed on exempting Canadian companies from Buy American provisions, which would have hurt the [[Canadian economy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/commerce/buyamerican-2010.aspx|title=Canada-U.S. agreement on Buy American came into force|publisher=Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada|access-date=February 21, 2010|date=February 16, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Canada-U.S. Agreement on Government Procurement|publisher=[[Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada]]|date=February 11, 2010}}</ref>

[[File:CBO GDP impact of ARRA 2009.png|thumb|250px|right|CBO estimates of the impact of the stimulus on GDP]]

The CBO estimated ARRA would positively impact GDP and employment. It projected an increase in the GDP of between 1.4&nbsp;percent and 3.8&nbsp;percent by the end of 2009, between 1.1&nbsp;percent and 3.3&nbsp;percent by the end of 2010, between 0.4&nbsp;percent and 1.3&nbsp;percent by the end of 2011, and a decrease of between zero and 0.2&nbsp;percent beyond 2014.<ref name="Feb 11 letter" /> The impact to employment would be an increase of 0.8&nbsp;million to 2.3&nbsp;million by the end of 2009, an increase of 1.2&nbsp;million to 3.6&nbsp;million by the end of 2010, an increase of 0.6&nbsp;million to 1.9&nbsp;million by the end of 2011, and declining increases in subsequent years as the U.S. labor market reaches nearly full employment, but never negative.<ref name="Feb 11 letter" /> Decreases in GDP in 2014 and beyond are accounted for by [[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]], where government debt absorbs finances that would otherwise go toward investment.<ref name="Feb 11 letter" /> A 2013 study by economists [[Stephen Marglin]] and Peter Spiegler found the stimulus had boosted GDP in line with CBO estimates.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Marglin | first1 = Stephen A. | author1-link = Stephen Marglin | last2 = Spiegler | first2 = Peter M. | date = July 2013 | title = Where Did All the Money Go?

A February 4, 2009, report by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) said that while the stimulus would increase economic output and employment in the short run, the GDP would, by 2019, have an estimated net decrease between 0.1% and 0.3% (as compared to the CBO estimated baseline).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/96xx/doc9619/Gregg.pdf | title=Official CBO report to the Senate budget committee | work=Congressional Budget Office | access-date=February 7, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207080825/http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/96xx/doc9619/Gregg.pdf | archive-date=February 7, 2009 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The CBO estimated that enacting the bill would increase federal budget deficits by $185 billion over the remaining months of fiscal year 2009, by $399 billion in 2010, and by $134 billion in 2011, or $787 billion over the 2009–2019 period.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/99xx/doc9989/hr1conference.pdf | title=CBO-Budgetary Impact of ARRA | work= Congressional Budget Office}}</ref>

In a February 11 letter, CBO Director [[Douglas Elmendorf]] noted that there was disagreement among economists about the effectiveness of the stimulus, with some skeptical of any significant effects while others expecting very large effects.<ref name="Feb 11 letter">{{cite web | url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/20474| title=Letter by Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the CBO | work= Congressional Budget Office | date= February 11, 2009}}</ref> Elmendorf said the CBO expected short term increases in GDP and employment.<ref name="Feb 11 letter" /> In the long term, the CBO expects the legislation to reduce output slightly by increasing the nation's debt and [[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]] private investment, but noted that other factors, such as improvements to roads and highways and increased spending for basic research and education may offset the decrease in output and that crowding out was not an issue in the short term because private investment was already decreasing in response to decreased demand.<ref name="Feb 11 letter" />

In February 2015, the CBO released its final analysis of the results of the law, which found that during six years:<ref>https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/49958-ARRA.pdf</ref>
* Real GDP was boosted by an average ranging from a low of 1.7% to a high of 9.2%
* The unemployment rate was reduced by an average ranging from a low of 1.1 percentage points to a high of 4.8 percentage points
* Full-time equivalent employment-years was boosted by an average ranging from 2.1 million to 11.6 million
* Total outlays were $663 billion, of which $97 billion were refundable tax credits

In the primary justification for the stimulus package, the Obama administration and Democratic proponents presented a graph in January 2009 showing the projected unemployment rate with and without the ARRA.<ref name="RC" /> The graph showed that if ARRA was not enacted the unemployment rate would exceed 9%; but if ARRA was enacted it would never exceed 8%. After ARRA became law, the actual unemployment rate exceeded 8% in February 2009, exceeded 9% in May 2009, and exceeded 10% in October 2009. The actual unemployment rate was 9.2% in June 2011 when it was projected to be below 7% with the ARRA. However, supporters of the ARRA claim that this can be accounted for by noting that the actual recession was subsequently revealed to be much worse than any projections at the time when the ARRA was drawn up.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}[[File:ARRA Unemployment Rate Graph 2011-05.jpg|thumb|Projected Unemployment Rate]]

According to a March 2009 Industry Survey of and by the National Association of Business Economists, 60.3% of their economists who had reviewed the fiscal stimulus enacted in February 2009 projected it would have a modest impact in shortening the recession, with 29.4% anticipating little or no impact as well as 10.3% predicting a strong impact.

One year after the stimulus, several independent macroeconomic firms, including [[Moody's]] and [[Global Insight|IHS Global Insight]], estimated that the stimulus saved or created 1.6 to 1.8 million jobs and forecast a total impact of 2.5 million jobs saved by the time the stimulus is completed.<ref name="Leonhardt Judging Stimulus">{{cite news |last=Leonhardt |first=David |title=Economic Scene: Judging Stimulus by Job Data Reveals Success |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 17, 2010 |page=B1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/business/economy/17leonhardt.html |access-date=January 17, 2013}}</ref> The Congressional Budget Office considered these estimates conservative.<ref name="Leonhardt Judging Stimulus" /> The CBO estimated according to its model 2.1 million jobs saved in the last quarter of 2009, boosting the economy by up to 3.5 percent and lowering the unemployment rate by up to 2.1 percent.<ref name="sullivan">{{cite news | last = Sullivan | first = Andy | title = Update 2-US stimulus added up to 2.1 mln jobs in Q4 2009-CBO | work = Reuters | date = February 23, 2010| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2311303720100223| access-date =February 28, 2010}}</ref> The CBO projected that the package would have an even greater impact in 2010.<ref name="sullivan" /> The CBO also said, "It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package."<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/106xx/doc10682/Frontmatter.2.2.shtml Estimated Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on Employment and Economic Output]</ref> The CBO's report on the first quarter of 2010 showed a continued positive effect, with an employment gain in that quarter of up to 2.8 million and a GDP boost of up to 4.2 percent.<ref>{{cite news | last = Sullivan| first = Andy| title = Corrected – Update 2-Stimulus raised GDP by up to 4.2 pct in Q1 2010 -CBO| work = Reuters| date = May 25, 2010| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2512520220100526?type=marketsNews| access-date =May 27, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100601233822/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2512520220100526?type=marketsNews| archive-date= June 1, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>  Economists Timothy Conley of the University of Western Ontario and Bill Dupor of the Ohio State University found that while the stimulus' effects on public sector job creation were unambiguously positive, the effects on private sector job creation were ambiguous.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jmoneco.2013.04.011| title=The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act: Solely a government jobs program?| journal=Journal of Monetary Economics| volume=60| issue=5| pages=535–549| year=2013| last1=Conley| first1=Timothy G.| last2=Dupor| first2=Bill}}</ref> Economist Dan Wilson of the Federal Reserve, who used similar methodology, without the same identified errors, estimates that "ARRA spending created or saved about 2 million jobs in its first year and over 3 million by March 2011."<ref>[http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2010/wp10-17bk.pdf Fiscal Spending Jobs Multipliers: Evidence from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act].

The CBO also revised its assessment of the long-term impact of the bill. After 2014, the stimulus is estimated to decrease output by zero to 0.2%. The stimulus is not expected to have a negative impact on employment in any period of time.<ref>CBO letter to Sen. Judd Gregg.

In 2011, the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] revised some of its previous estimates. Economist [[Dean Baker]] commented:

<blockquote>[T]he revised data ... showed that the economy was plunging even more rapidly than we had previously recognised in the two quarters following the collapse of [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman]]. Yet, the plunge stopped in the second quarter of 2009 – just as the stimulus came on line. This was followed by respectable growth over the next four quarters. Growth then weakened again as the impact of the stimulus began to fade at the end of 2010 and the start of this year.

In other words, the growth pattern shown by the revised data sure makes it appear that the stimulus worked. The main problem would seem to be that the stimulus was not big enough and it wasn't left in place long enough to lift the economy to anywhere near potential output.<ref>{{Citation| last = Baker| first = Dean| author-link = Dean Baker| title = US debt deal: how Washington lost the plot| newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | date = August 1, 2011| url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/01/us-debt-deal-washington-unemployment | access-date =August 3, 2011 | location=London}}</ref></blockquote>

The [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) established a "Hypocrisy Hall of Fame" to list Republican Representatives who had voted against ARRA but who then sought or took credit for ARRA programs in their districts. As of September 2011, the DCCC was listing 128 House Republicans in this category.<ref>{{cite web| title = Hypocrisy Alert: 128 House Republicans Take Credit for the Economic Bills They Opposed| publisher = [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]]| url = http://www.dccc.org/page/content/hhof| access-date = September 10, 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110909000218/http://www.dccc.org/page/content/hhof/| archive-date = September 9, 2011| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref> ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that many of the Republican legislators who publicly argued that the stimulus would not create jobs were writing letters seeking stimulus programs for their districts on the grounds that the spending would create jobs.<ref>{{Citation| last = Stone | first = Daniel | title = The Tea Party Pork Binge| newspaper = [[The Daily Beast]]  | date = October 30, 2011  | url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/10/30/conseratives-brought-nation-to-default-ask-for-govt-handouts.html| access-date =November 10, 2011}}</ref>

The stimulus has been criticized as being too small. In July 2010, a group of 40 prominent economists issued a statement calling for expanded stimulus programs to reduce unemployment. They also challenged the view that the priority should be reducing the deficit: "Making deficit reduction the first target, without addressing the chronic underlying deficiency of demand, is exactly the error of the 1930s."<ref>{{cite web|title=Reboot America – Manifesto Support Surges |website=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=July 19, 2010 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-07-20/reboot-america-manifesto-supporters-swells-to-40/ |access-date=July 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723133508/http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-07-20/reboot-america-manifesto-supporters-swells-to-40/ |archive-date=July 23, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In July 2010, the White House [[Council of Economic Advisers]] (CEA) estimated that the stimulus had "saved or created between 2.5 and 3.6 million jobs as of the second quarter of 2010".<ref>[[Council of Economic Advisers]], [http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/cea_4th_arra_report.pdf "The Economic Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805070850/http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/cea_4th_arra_report.pdf |date=August 5, 2010 }}, July 14, 2010, p. 1.</ref>  At that point, spending outlays under the stimulus totaled $257 billion and tax cuts totaled $223 billion.<ref>[[Council of Economic Advisers]], [http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/cea_4th_arra_report.pdf "The Economic Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805070850/http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/cea_4th_arra_report.pdf |date=August 5, 2010 }}, July 14, 2010, p. 4.</ref> In July 2011, the CEA estimated that as of the first quarter of  2011,<ref>[[Council of Economic Advisers]], [http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/cea_7th_arra_report.pdf "The Economic Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706130436/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/cea_7th_arra_report.pdf |date=July 6, 2011 }}, July 1, 2011, p. 1.</ref> the ARRA raised employment relative to what it otherwise would have been by between 2.4 and 3.6 million. The sum of outlays and tax cuts up to this point was $666 billion. Using a straight mathematical calculation, critics reported that the ARRA cost taxpayers between $185,000 to $278,000 per job that was created, though this computation does not include the permanent infrastructure that resulted.

In August 2010, Republican Senators [[Tom Coburn]] and [[John McCain]] released a report listing 100 projects it described as the "most wasteful projects" funded by the Act. In total, the projects questioned by the two senators amounted to about $15 billion, or less than 2% of the $862 billion. The two senators did concede that the stimulus has had a positive effect on the economy, though they criticized it for failing to give "the biggest bang for our buck" on the issue of job creation. CNN noted that the two senators' stated objections were brief summaries presenting selective accounts that were unclear, and the journalists pointed out several instances where they created erroneous impressions.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/08/03/senators.stimulus.spending.hfr/?hpt=Sbin#fbid=ArbgvoCEUuW | work=CNN | title=GOP slams stimulus plan with list of 100 worst projects | date=August 3, 2010}}</ref>

One of the primary purposes and promises of the Act was to launch a large number of "[[shovel ready]]" projects that would generate jobs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Calmes |first=Jackie |author2=Carl Hulse |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/us/politics/04stimulus.html |title=Obama Considers Major Expansion in Aid to Jobless |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 4, 2009 |page=A1 |access-date=November 16, 2010|author2-link=Carl Hulse }}</ref> However, a sizable number of these projects, most of which pertained to infrastructure, took longer to implement than they had expected by most.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cooper |first=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/us/19stimulus.html |title=Obama Hopes 'Recovery Summer' Will Warm Voters to the Stimulus |date=June 19, 2010 |page=A8 |access-date=November 16, 2010 |work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Peter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/magazine/17obama-t.html |title=Education of a President |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 17, 2010 |page=MM40 of the Sunday Magazine |quote=He realized too late that 'there's no such thing as shovel-ready projects' when it comes to public works. |access-date=November 16, 2010}}</ref> This was largely attributed to the regulatory process that is involved in such projects. {{citation needed|reason="Generally implied by earlier mentioned citations in this paragraph but not directly stated"|date=April 2012}}

Some of the tax incentives in the Act, including those related to the [[American opportunity tax credit]] and [[Earned Income Tax Credit]], were extended for a further two years by the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]].<ref name="at-sum">{{cite news | url= http://www.accountingtoday.com/news/Tax-Cut-Extension-Bill-Wends-Way-White-House-56664-1.html | title=Tax Cut Extension Bill Wends Its Way to White House | magazine=[[Accounting Today]] | date=December 17, 2010 | access-date=December 17, 2010}}</ref>

In November 2011, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) updated its earlier reports concerning the Act. The CBO stated that "the employment effects began to wane at the end of 2010 and have continued to do so throughout 2011."  Nevertheless, in the third quarter of 2011, the CBO estimated that the Act had increased the number of full-time equivalent jobs by 0.5 million to 3.3 million.<ref>{{cite web| title = Estimated Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on Employment and Economic Output from July 2011 Through September 2011| publisher = [[Congressional Budget Office]]| date = November 2011| url = http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/125xx/doc12564/11-22-ARRA.pdf| access-date =November 24, 2011}}</ref> Section 1513 of the Recovery Act stated that reports on the impact of the act were to be submitted quarterly, however the last report issued occurred for the second quarter of 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ahead of Election, Obama Stops Releasing 'Stimulus' Reports |author=Jeffrey H.

In 2013, the [[Reason Foundation]], an American [[libertarian]] group, conducted a study of the results of the ARRA. Only 23% of the 8,381 sampled companies hired new workers and kept all of them when the project was completed. Also, just 41% of sampled companies hired workers at all, while 30% of sampled companies did hire but laid off all workers once the government money stopped funding.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stimulus Jobs Vanish|author=Anthony Randazzo|url=http://reason.com/archives/2013/04/16/stimulus-jobs-vanish|newspaper=Reason Magazine|date=16 April 2013|access-date=16 April 2013}}</ref> These results cast doubt on previously stated estimates of job creation numbers, which do not factor those companies that did not retain their workers or hire any at all.

In February 2014, the White House stated in a release that the stimulus measure saved or created an average of 1.6 million jobs a year between 2009 and 2012, thus averting having the recession descend into another [[Great Depression]]. Republicans, such as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[John Boehner]] of Ohio, criticized the report since, in their views, the Act cost too much for too little result.<ref name=superville>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2014/02/17/white-house-stimulus-bill-was-good-for-economy|access-date=February 24, 2014|date=February 17, 2014|title=White House: Stimulus was good for economy; GOP says big spending produced little results|first=Darlene|last=Superville|magazine=[[US News & World Report]]}}</ref>

== Oversight and administration ==
In addition to the Vice President Biden's oversight role, a high-level advisory body, the [[President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board]] (later renamed and reconstituted as the "President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness"), was named concurrent to the passage of the act.

As well, the President named [[Inspector General#United States|Inspector General]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior]] [[Earl Devaney]] and the [[Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board]] (RATB) to monitor administration of the Act, and prevent low levels of fraud, waste and loss in fund allocation.<ref>Wolf, Paula, [http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/234298 "Obama picks F&M alum to oversee stimulus plan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228083224/http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/234298 |date=February 28, 2009 }}, ''LancasterOnline'', February 25, 2009.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/09/10/10greenwire-interior-ig-brings-detectives-zeal-to-stimulus-6880.html?pagewanted=1|title=Interior IG Brings Detective's Zeal to Stimulus Watchdog Post|last=Yehle|first=Emily|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> Eleven other inspectors general served on the RATB, and the board also had a [[Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board#Advisory Panel|Recovery Independent Advisory Panel]].

In late 2011, Devaney and his fellow inspectors general on RATB, and more who were not, were credited with avoiding any major scandals in the administration of the Act, in the eyes of one Washington observer.<ref>[[Jonathan Alter|Alter, Jonathan]], [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/november_december_2011/features/scandal_in_the_age_of_obama032995.php?page=4 "Scandal in the Age of Obama"], ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', November/ December 2011.

In May 2016, the chairman of the U.S. [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]], Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-UT), launched the first steps of an investigation into a part of the stimulus law that gave grants to solar and green energy companies. Hatch sent a letter to the IRS and Treasury Department with a list of questions about the program. According to the ''Wall Street Journal'', letters from senior senators who chair committees can lead to formal investigations by Congress.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/senior-senator-launches-inquiry-on-green-energy-grants-1458079073|title=Senior Senator Launches Inquiry on 'Green Energy' Grants|last1=Mullins|first1=Brody|date=2016-03-15|last2=Dugan|first2=Ianthe Jeanne|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-05-16}}</ref>

One part of the stimulus law, section 1603, gave cash grants to solar companies to encourage investment in solar technology. Because many companies didn't yet make a profit in 2009 in that industry, they were offered cash instead of tax credits. In September 2015, the U.S. government asked that a Spanish company return $1 million it had received from the program. The company issued a statement saying it fully complied with the request.<ref name=":0" />
