'''United Way of America''' (now '''United Way Worldwide'''), based in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], is a [[nonprofit organization]] that works with almost 1,200 offices throughout the country in a coalition of [[charitable organization]]s to pool efforts in fundraising and support. United Way's focus is to identify and resolve pressing community issues and to make measurable changes in communities through partnerships with schools, government agencies, businesses, organized labor, financial institutions, community development corporations, voluntary and neighborhood associations, the faith community, and others. The main areas include education, income, and health.

United Way of America has been the largest non-profit organization by donations from the public, prior to 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2017/03/23/a-philanthropic-boom-donor-advised-funds|title=A philanthropic boom: "donor-advised funds"|website=The Economist|date=March 23, 2017|accessdate=June 9, 2019}}</ref>

==History==
The organization has roots in [[Denver, Colorado]], where in 1887 [[Frances Wisebart Jacobs]], along with other religious leaders, began the [[Charity Organization Society]], which coordinated services between Jewish and Christian charities and fundraising for 22 agencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liveunited.org/about/history.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429190240/http://www.liveunited.org/about/history.cfm|url-status=dead|archivedate=April 29, 2008|title=history page on the United Way Web site|website=liveunited.org}}</ref> Many [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]] organizations, which were founded in the first half of the twentieth century to jointly collect and allocate money, joined the American Association for Community Organizations in 1918. The first Community Chest was founded in 1913 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]],<ref>Ohiolink, [http://ead.ohiolink.edu/xtf-ead/view?docId=ead/OCLWHi1512.xml Biography of Whiting Williams] (accessed August 29, 2013).  See also [[Whiting Williams]] article.</ref> after the example of the [[Jewish Federation]] in Cleveland—which served as an exemplary model for "federated giving". The number of Community Chest organizations increased from 39 to 353 between 1919 and 1929 and surpassed 1,000 by 1948. In 1948, Walter C. Laidlaw merged the Community Chest and other Detroit charities to form the United Foundation.<ref>https://reuther.wayne.edu/files/UR001289_WCL.pdf</ref> Walter Laidlaw's work with the United Foundation became the model for united funds nationally and eventually the United Way organization.

In 1928, a Community Chest organization was established in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. (In 2015, continued neglect by United Way Worldwide, including legal and financial scandals, has led to no active United Way presence in the country and completely severed ties with Community Chest).  By 1974, there were enough United Way organizations internationally to demand the kind of support provided by the national organization, United Way of America and United Way International was born (later these organizations were joined together and renamed to [[United Way Worldwide]]). Its staff spoke eight languages, with a Board of Directors from more than seven countries, working with member organizations. Amundsen, Chief Administrative Officer, served as interim president during a yearlong search.

By 1963, and after several name changes, the term ''United Way'' was adopted, but not everyone chose to use it. After Walter C. Laidlaw fell ill, [[William Aramony]] became [[CEO]] of the national governing body known as the ''United Community Funds and Council of America'' (UCFCA) and in 1970 the organization was renamed United Way of America (UWA). It moved from [[New York City]] to [[Alexandria, Virginia]] in 1971.<ref name=UNIV>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/United-Way-of-America-Company-History.html|title=History of United Way of America – FundingUniverse}}</ref>

After Aramony's departure in 1992, Kenneth W. Dam was named interim CEO until [[Elaine Chao]] was selected as UWA's second president. Betty Stanley Beene took over in 1997 and stayed until 2002.<ref>{{cite news|author=David Cay Johnston|title=United Way Faces Crisis As President Plans to Leave|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 19, 2000|page=A00019}}</ref> Chris Brian Gallagher, former head of United Way in [[Columbus, Ohio]], accepted the job in 2002<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unitedway.org/about/leadership/brian-a-gallagher|title=Brian Gallagher {{!}} United Way Worldwide|website=www.unitedway.org|accessdate=June 9, 2019}}</ref> and as president and CEO, Brian Gallagher was compensated over $1.5 million in 2012<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unway.3cdn.net/b17e3f7b4d9d76de87_ddm6brj5p.pdf|title=United Way Worldwide IRS Form 990 2012}}</ref> with eight executives receiving over $300,000 in compensation in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unway.3cdn.net/fd5e6a3164927c2cc2_l3jm65q2d.pdf|title=United Way Worldwide IRS Form 990 2013}}</ref> In 2014, Brian Gallagher received $1.54 million in compensation while the organization experienced its largest worldwide loss in revenue, volunteers, and donors in many years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/uww.assets/site/reporting/UWW_IRS_Form_990_(2014_-_Public_Disclosure_Copy).pdf|title=United Way Worldwide IRS Form 990 2014}}</ref>

In the 2007 ''Philanthropy 400'', United Way Worldwide was again the largest charity in the United States, with 1,285 local United Ways reporting over $4.2 billion in contributions, a 2.2% increase over 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Philanthropy 400|work=[[The Chronicle of Philanthropy]]|page=10|date=October 30, 2008}}</ref>

In May 2009, United Way of America and [[United Way International]] were integrated as one global entity, [[United Way Worldwide]].<ref>[http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.united_way_worldwide.7dbd547abf55f60e.html "United Way Worldwide"] Hoovers Business Intelligence, company profiles</ref>

==National partnerships==
*The ongoing partnership with the [[National Football League]] began in 1973 when the NFL and United Way of America came together to discuss the possibility of using the NFL's network contract airtime to promote United Way during game telecasts. NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] recognized the partnership as a viable means of communicating the good works of United Ways while putting faces on a league of players hidden by helmets.
*National partnerships with over 100 corporations are formalized through the National Corporate Leadership Program.<ref>[https://www.unitedway.org/our-partners Our Partners]</ref>
*Since 1946, the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations ([[AFL-CIO]]) and United Way Worldwide have enjoyed a cooperative relationship

==Scandals and criticism==
*In 1986, The United Way of Cleveland, Ohio, held an event called [[Balloonfest '86]], setting a world record by releasing 1.5 million balloons. Unfortunately, the event had disastrous consequences, wreaking havoc at [[Burke Lakefront Airport]] and [[Lake Erie]], causing injury to animals and contributing to two fishermen's deaths.<ref>{{cite news|author=John Kroll|url=https://www.cleveland.com/remembers/2011/08/balloonfest_1986_the_spectacle.html|title=Balloonfest 1986, the spectacle that became a debacle: Cleveland Remembers (video)|work=The Plain Dealer|date=August 15, 2011|accessdate=June 9, 2019}}</ref>
*[[William Aramony]], CEO of the national organization for over 20 years, retired in 1992 amid allegations of fraud and financial mismanagement, of which he was subsequently convicted.

After the 2012 [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], the United Way of Western Connecticut was criticized by some victims' family members for a lack of transparency in fundraising. According to those critical of the agency, the money was raised in a way that implied it would be used for the families, but then much of it re-purposed for broader community needs. As the organization focuses on community long term work, the United Way stated that majority was intended to go to non-exclusive, community support programs like counseling, after school or job-support programs; however, this angered those who felt the money should go directly to the families of those affected.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/us/politics/sandy-hook-money.html|author=Williamson, Elizabeth|title=A Lesson of Sandy Hook: ‘Err on the Side of the Victims’|work=The New York Times|date=May 25, 2019|accessdate=June 9, 2019}}</ref>
