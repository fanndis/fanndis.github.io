The '''Supreme Court''' ([[initialism]]: '''UKSC''' or the [[acronym]]: '''SCOTUK''') is the [[Supreme court|final court of appeal]] in the United Kingdom for civil cases, and for criminal cases from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It hears cases of the greatest public or constitutional importance affecting the whole population, including disputes relating to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]].<ref name="UKSC Online Introduction">{{cite web |title=The Supreme Court |url= https://www.supremecourt.uk/ |date=12 January 2013 |publisher=The Registry, the Supreme Court (The Registry of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom) |access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref>

The Court usually sits in the [[Middlesex Guildhall]] in [[Westminster]], though can sit elsewhere and has, for example, sat in the [[Edinburgh City Chambers]],<ref>'[https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/supreme-court-to-sit-in-scotland.html Supreme Court to sit in Scotland]': Press release from the Supreme Court, 1 March 2017</ref> the [[Royal Courts of Justice, Belfast|Royal Courts of Justice]] in Belfast,<ref>'[https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/uk-supreme-court-bound-for-northern-ireland.html UK Supreme Court bound for Northern Ireland]': Press release from the Supreme Court, 27 November 2017</ref> and the Tŷ Hywel Building in Cardiff.<ref>[https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/uk-supreme-court-to-sit-in-wales-this-summer.html UK Supreme Court to sit in Wales this summer]': Press release from the Supreme Court, 1 March 2017</ref>

The United Kingdom has a doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], so the Supreme Court is much more limited in its powers of [[judicial review]] than the constitutional or supreme courts of some other countries. It cannot overturn any [[primary legislation]] made by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. However, it can overturn [[secondary legislation]] if, for an example, that legislation is found to be ''[[ultra vires]]'' to the powers in primary legislation allowing it to be made.

Further, under [[Sections 4 and 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998|section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998]], the Supreme Court, like some other courts in the United Kingdom, may make a [[declaration of incompatibility]], indicating that it believes that the legislation subject to the declaration is incompatible with one of the rights in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Such a declaration can apply to primary or secondary legislation. The legislation is not overturned by the declaration, and neither Parliament nor the government is required to agree with any such declaration. However, if they do accept a declaration, ministers can exercise powers under [[Sections 4 and 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998|section 10 of the Human Rights Act]] to amend the legislation by statutory instrument to remove the incompatibility or ask Parliament to amend the legislation.

As authorised by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], Part 3, Section 23(1),<ref name="UKSC Enabling legislation" /> the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom was formally established on 1 October 2009 and is a [[non-ministerial government department]] of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations|title=Departments, agencies and public bodies|website=GOV.UK|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>

It assumed the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords]], which had been exercised by the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]] (commonly called "[[Law Lords]]"), the 12 judges appointed as members of the [[House of Lords]] to carry out its judicial business as the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]]. Its jurisdiction over devolution matters had previously been [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council#Domestic jurisdiction|exercised]] by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].

The current President of the Supreme Court is [[Robert Reed, Lord Reed|Lord Reed]].

== History ==
=== Creation ===
[[File:Middlesex Guildhall (cropped).jpg|thumb|The [[Middlesex Guildhall]] in London is the location of the Supreme Court]]

The creation of a Supreme Court for the United Kingdom was first mooted in a consultation paper published by the [[Department of Constitutional Affairs]] in July 2003.<ref name="DCA paper">{{cite document |publisher=[[Department of Constitutional Affairs]] |title=Constitutional Reform: A Supreme Court for the United Kingdom |date=July 2003 |url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/ }}</ref> Although the paper noted that there had been no criticism of the then-current Law Lords or any indication of an actual bias, it argued that the separation of the [[judicial]] functions of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] from the legislative functions of the [[House of Lords]] should be made explicit. The paper noted the following concerns:

# Whether there was any longer sufficient transparency of independence from the executive and the legislature to give assurance of the independence of the judiciary.<ref name="DCA paper" />
# The requirement for the appearance of impartiality and independence limited the ability of the Law Lords to contribute to the work of the House itself, thus reducing the value to both them and the House of their membership.<ref name="DCA paper" />
# It was not always understood by the public that judicial decisions of "the House of Lords" were in fact taken by the Appellate Committee and that non-judicial members were never involved in the judgments. Conversely, it was felt that the extent to which the Law Lords themselves had decided to refrain from getting involved in political issues in relation to legislation on which they might later have had to adjudicate was not always appreciated.<ref name="DCA paper" /> The new President of the Court, [[Nick Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers|Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers]], has claimed that the old system had confused people and that with the Supreme Court there would for the first time be a clear [[separation of powers]] among the judiciary, the legislature and the executive.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/6251272/New-Supreme-Court-opens-with-media-barred.html |title=New Supreme Court opens with media barred |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=1 October 2009 |quote=For the first time, we have a clear separation of powers between the legislature, the judiciary and the executive in the United Kingdom. This is important. It emphasises the independence of the judiciary, clearly separating those who make the law from those who administer it. |location=London |access-date=24 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004110430/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/6251272/New-Supreme-Court-opens-with-media-barred.html |archive-date=4 October 2009}}</ref>
# Space within the House of Lords was at a constant premium and a separate supreme court would ease the pressure on the Palace of Westminster.<ref name="DCA paper" />

The main argument against a new Supreme Court was that the previous system had worked well and kept costs down.<ref>Wakeham report 2000, Chapter 9, Recommendation 57.</ref>
Reformers expressed concern that this second main example of a mixture of the legislative, judicial and executive might conflict with professed values under the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Officials who make or execute laws have an interest in court cases that put those laws to the test. When the state invests judicial authority in those officials or even their day-to-day colleagues, it puts the independence and impartiality of the courts at risk. Consequently, it was hypothesised closely connected decisions of the Law Lords to debates had by friends or on which the [[Lord Chancellor]] had expressed a view might be challenged on human-rights grounds on the basis that they had not constituted a fair trial.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/6252414/The-Supreme-Court-is-an-unnecessary-attack-on-the-constitution.html |title=The Supreme Court is an unnecessary attack on the constitution |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=1 October 2009 |quote=The Government argued that there must be a separation in order to comply with Article Six of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees a fair trial. |location=London |access-date=24 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005191604/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/6252414/The-Supreme-Court-is-an-unnecessary-attack-on-the-constitution.html |archive-date=5 October 2009 }}</ref>

[[David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury|Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury]], later President of the Supreme Court, expressed fear that the new court could make itself more powerful than the House of Lords committee it succeeded, saying that there is a real risk of "judges arrogating to themselves greater power than they have at the moment". Lord Phillips said such an outcome was "a possibility", but was "unlikely".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8237855.stm |first=Joshua |last=Rozenberg |title=Fear over UK Supreme Court impact |work=[[BBC News]] |date=8 September 2009}}</ref>

The reforms were controversial and were brought forward with little consultation but were subsequently extensively debated in Parliament.<ref>See A Le Sueur, 'From Appellate Committee to Supreme Court: A Narrative', chap 5 in L. Blom-Cooper, G. Drewry and B. Dickson (eds),''The Judicial House of Lords'' (Oxford University Press, 2009); Queen Mary School of Law Legal Studies Research Paper No. 17/2009.

=== Cases and competences ===
The first case heard by the Supreme Court was ''[[HM Treasury v Ahmed]]'', which concerned "the separation of powers", according to Phillips, its inaugural President. At issue was the extent to which Parliament has, by the [[United Nations Act 1946]], delegated to the executive the power to legislate. Resolution of this issue depended upon the approach properly to be adopted by the court in interpreting legislation which may affect fundamental rights at common law or under the European Convention on Human Rights.

From the Supreme Court —

{{Quote|quote  = The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal in the UK for civil cases, and for criminal cases from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It hears cases of the greatest public or constitutional importance affecting the whole population.<ref name="UKSC Online Introduction"/>}}

For Scottish civil cases decided prior to September 2015, permission to appeal from the Court of Session was not required and any such case can proceed to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom if two [[Faculty of Advocates|advocates]] certify that an appeal is suitable.  The entry into force of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 has essentially brought the procedure for current and future Scottish civil cases into line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland, where permission to appeal is required, either from the Court of Session or from a [[Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Justice of the Supreme Court]] itself.

The Supreme Court's focus is on cases that raise points of law of general public importance. As with the former [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]], appeals from many fields of law are likely to be selected for hearing, including commercial disputes, family matters, judicial review claims against public authorities and issues under the Human Rights Act 1998.

The Supreme Court only exceptionally hears criminal appeals from the [[High Court of Justiciary]] with respect to "devolution issues".

The Supreme Court also determines "devolution issues" (as defined by the [[Scotland Act 1998]], the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] and the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]]). These are legal proceedings about the powers of the three [[devolved]] administrations—the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], the [[Scottish Government]] and the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[Welsh Government]] and [[Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament|Senedd Cymru]]. Devolution issues were previously heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and most are about compliance with rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, brought into national law by the Devolution Acts and the Human Rights Act 1998.

==Panels and sittings==
All twelve justices do not all hear every case. Unless there are circumstances requiring a larger panel, a case is usually heard by a panel of five justices.<ref name=PanelNumbers>{{cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/procedures/panel-numbers-criteria.html |title=Panel numbers criteria|publisher=Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|access-date= 17 September 2019}}</ref> More than five justices may sit on a panel where the case is of "high constitutional importance" or "great public importance"; if the case raises "an important point in relation to the European Convention on Human Rights"; if the case involves a conflict of decisions among the House of Lords, [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], or Supreme Court; or if the Court "is being asked to depart, or may decide to depart from" its previous precedent.<ref name=PanelNumbers/> 

To avoid a tie, all cases are heard by a panel containing an odd number of justices.<ref name="Casciani">{{cite news|author=Dominic Casciani|title=What is the UK Supreme Court? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49663001|work=BBC News}}</ref> Thus, the largest possible panel for a case is 11 justices.<ref name="Casciani"/> To date, there have been only two occasions (both involving matters of major constitutional importance)  heard by 11 justices: the case of ''[[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]]'' (argued in 2016 and decided in 2017) and the cases of [[R (Miller) v The Prime Minister and Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland|''R (Miller) v The Prime Minister'' and ''Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland'']] (argued and decided in 2019).<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37874388 The 11 Supreme Court judges who ruled on UK's Brexit appeal], BBC News (24 January 2017).</ref><ref>Owen Bowcott, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/16/supreme-court-to-hear-claims-suspension-of-parliament-is-unlawful Supreme court to hear claims suspension of parliament is unlawful], ''The Guardian'' (16 September 2019).</ref>

== Administration ==
The Supreme Court has a separate administration from the other courts of the United Kingdom, under a Chief Executive who is appointed by the Court's President.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/mark-ormerod-to-be-supreme-court-chief-executive.html|title=Mark Ormerod to be Supreme Court's Chief Executive - The Supreme Court|last=Court|first=The Supreme|website=www.supremecourt.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/about/executive-team.html|title=Executive Team - The Supreme Court|last=Court|first=The Supreme|website=www.supremecourt.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite legislation UK

== Other "supreme courts" in the United Kingdom ==
{{PoliticsUK}}
The High Court of Justiciary, the [[Court of Session]], and the [[Office of the Accountant of Court]] make up the [[College of Justice]], and are known as "the Supreme Courts of Scotland".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/docs/you_and_us/recruitment/SCS%20An%20Introduction.pdf |title=Scottish Court Service: An Introduction |quote=The Supreme Courts are made up of the Court of Session, the High Court of Justiciary and the Accountant of Court's Office |publisher=[[Scottish Court Service]] |access-date=23 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721231546/http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/docs/you_and_us/recruitment/SCS%20An%20Introduction.pdf |archive-date=21 July 2011 }}</ref>

Prior to 1 October 2009, there were two other courts known as "the supreme court", namely the Supreme Court of England and Wales (known as "the Supreme Court of Judicature", prior to the passing and coming-into-force of the [[Senior Courts Act 1981]]), which was created in the 1870s under the [[Judicature Acts]], and the Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland, both of which consisted of a [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], a [[High Court of Justice]] and a [[Crown Court]]. When the provisions of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 came into force these became known as the [[Senior Courts of England and Wales]] and the [[Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland|Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland]] respectively.

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council also retains [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council#Jurisdiction|jurisdiction]] over certain matters. By Section 4 of the [[Judicial Committee Act 1833]], the Sovereign may refer any matter whatsoever to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to provide advice, although this does not confer judicial authority.<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Will4/3-4/41/section/4 Section 4, Judicial Committee Act 1833]: Legislation.gov.uk</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Peplow |first1=Alex |title=A Curious Jurisdiction – Section 4 of the Judicial Committee Act 1833 |url=https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2016/07/15/alex-peplow-a-curious-jurisdiction-section-4-of-the-judicial-committee-act-1833/ |website=UK Constitutional Law Association |access-date=22 May 2020 |language=en |date=15 July 2016}}</ref>

The judicial functions of the House of Lords have all been abolished, other than the [[Impeachment in the United Kingdom|trial of impeachments]], a procedure which has been obsolete for 200 years.

== Judges ==
{{Main|Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom}}
The court is composed of the [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|President]] and [[Deputy President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Deputy President]] and ten other [[Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Justices of the Supreme Court]], all with the style of "''Justices of the Supreme Court''" under section 23(6) of the Constitutional Reform Act.<ref name="UKSC Enabling legislation"/> The President and Deputy President of the court are separately appointed to those roles.

The ten [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary|Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]] (Law Lords) holding office on 1 October 2009 became the first judges of the twelve-member Supreme Court.<ref>Constitutional Reform Act 2005, section 24</ref> The eleventh place on the Supreme Court was filled by [[Tony Clarke, Baron Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony|Lord Clarke]] (formerly the [[Master of the Rolls]]), who was the first justice to be appointed directly to the Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page19036 |title=Justice of the UK Supreme Court |publisher=10 Downing Street |access-date=30 August 2009 |location=London, United Kingdom |date=20 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100408130944/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page19036 |archive-date=8 April 2010 }}</ref> One of the former Law Lords, Lord Neuberger, was appointed to replace Clarke as Master of the Rolls,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article6724777.ece |author=[[Frances Gibb]] |title=Lord Neuberger named Master of the Rolls |date=23 July 2009 |access-date=30 August 2009 |work=The Times | location=London}}</ref> and so did not move to the new court.

On 30 September 2010 [[Mark Saville, Baron Saville of Newdigate|Lord Saville]] became the first justice to retire,<ref name="sav-ret">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/jun/24/supreme-court-vacancy-retirement-age|title=Vacancy in the supreme court – and age could be a deciding factor – Joshua Rozenburg|first=Joshua|last=Rozenberg|date=24 June 2010|website=the Guardian|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref> followed by [[Lawrence Collins, Baron Collins of Mapesbury|Lord Collins]] on 7 May 2011, although the latter remained as an acting judge until the end of July 2011.

In June 2011 [[Alan Rodger, Baron Rodger of Earlsferry|Lord Rodger]] became the first justice to die in office, after a short illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-13922675|title=Supreme Court judge dies aged 66|date=27 June 2011|access-date=2 September 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

=== Acting judges ===
In addition to the twelve permanent judges, the President may request other senior judges drawn from two groups to sit as "acting judges" of the Supreme Court.<ref>Constitutional Reform Act 2005, section 38</ref>
* The first group are those judges who hold 'office as a senior territorial judge': judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, judges of the [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland]] and judges of the First or Second Division of the [[Inner House]] of the Court of Session in Scotland.
* The second group are known as the 'supplementary panel'. The President may approve in writing retired senior judges' membership of this panel if they are under 75 years of age (a system similar to [[senior status]] in the United States [[United States courts of appeal|Federal Courts of Appeal]]).

=== Appointment process ===
The [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] makes provision for a new appointment process for Justices of the Supreme Court. An independent selection commission is to be formed when vacancies arise. This is to be composed of the President of the Supreme Court (the chair), another senior UK judge (not a Supreme Court Justice), and a member of the [[Judicial Appointments Commission]] of England and Wales, the [[Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland]] and the Northern Ireland Judicial Appointments Commission. By law, at least one of these cannot be a lawyer. However, there is a similar but separate commission to appoint the next President of the Supreme Court, which is chaired by one of the non-lawyer members and features another Supreme Court Justice in the place of the President. Both of these commissions are convened by the [[Secretary of State for Justice]] (Lord Chancellor).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/supreme-court-selection-process-for-president-and-justices-2019.html|title=Supreme Court selection process for President and Justices|publisher=The Supreme Court|access-date=7 April 2020|date=8 February 2019}}</ref> In October 2007, the Ministry of Justice announced that the appointment process would be adopted on a voluntary basis for appointments of [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/announcement_081007c.htm |title=Supreme Court – new appointments process |publisher=Ministry of Justice |access-date=16 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224063723/http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/announcement_081007c.htm |archive-date=24 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The commission selects one person for the vacancy and notifies the Secretary of State for Justice of its choice. The Secretary of State for Justice then either
* approves the commission's selection
* rejects the commission's selection, or
* asks the commission to reconsider its selection.

If the Secretary of State for Justice approves the person selected by the commission, the Prime Minister must then recommend that person to the Monarch for appointment.<ref>Constitutional Reform Act 2005, sections 25–31</ref>

New judges appointed to the Supreme Court after its creation will not necessarily receive peerages; however, they are given the [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] of Lord or Lady upon appointment.<ref name="Gazette Lord Warrant"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/pr_1013.pdf|title=Courtesy titles for Justices of the Supreme Court|date=13 December 2010|publisher=Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|access-date=14 December 2010}}</ref> The President and Deputy President are appointed to those roles rather than being the most senior by tenure in office.

After a lengthy survey of suitable sites, including [[Somerset House]], the Government announced that the new court would be at the Middlesex Guildhall, in [[Parliament Square]], Westminster. That decision was examined by the Constitutional Affairs Committee,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmconst/465/7041701.htm |title=Minutes of Oral Evidence Taken before the Constitutional Affairs Committee 17 April 2007 |access-date=23 May 2008}}</ref> and the grant of planning permission by [[Westminster City Council]] for refurbishment works was challenged in a [[Judicial review in English Law|judicial review]] by the conservation group [[Save Britain's Heritage]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/807.html |title=''The Queen on the application of Save Britain's Heritage v. Westminster City Council'' |publisher=High Court (Administrative Court) |access-date=23 May 2008}}</ref> It was also reported that [[English Heritage]] had been put under great pressure to approve the alterations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article677664.ece|title=Lord Falconer's supreme blunder'' |work=The Times |access-date=26 October 2008 | location=London | first=Marcus | last=Binney | date=22 June 2006}}</ref> Feilden + Mawson, supported by Foster & Partners, were the appointed architects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070115/text/70115w0026.htm |title=Questions to the Department for Constitutional Affairs, 15 January 2007 (Col. 877W) |publisher=Commons Hansard}}</ref>

The building had been used as the Middlesex [[Quarter Sessions]] House, adding later its [[Middlesex County Council|county council]] chamber, and lastly as a Crown Court centre.

== Temporary sittings ==
To provide more members of the public in different parts of the United Kingdom with the opportunity to see the work of the court, a five-member panel of the court will sit during June 2017 at the [[Edinburgh City Chambers]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-40241851|title=UK Supreme Court sits in Edinburgh for the first time|date=12 June 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=18 June 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>-->

== Badge ==
The official badge of the Supreme Court was granted by the [[College of Arms]] in October 2008.<ref name="collegeofarms">{{cite web|url=https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/newsletter/2008/item/47-december-2008-newsletter-no-19|title=The College of Arms Newsletter|date=December 2008|publisher=College of Arms|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> It comprises both the Greek letter [[omega]] (representing finality) and the symbol of [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] (symbolising the scales of justice), in addition to the four [[Floral emblem#United Kingdom|floral emblems of the United Kingdom]]: a [[Tudor rose]], representing England, conjoined with the leaves of a [[leek]], representing Wales; a [[flax]] (or 'lint') blossom for Northern Ireland; and a [[thistle]], representing Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/visiting/new-artwork.html#emblem|title=New artwork: Supreme Court emblem|publisher=The Supreme Court|access-date=29 November 2015}}</ref>

Two adapted versions of its official badge are used by the Supreme Court. One features the words "The Supreme Court" and the letter omega in black (in the official badge granted by the College of Arms, the interior of the Latin and Greek letters are gold and white, respectively), and displays a simplified version of the crown (also in black) and larger, stylised versions of the floral emblems; this modified version of the badge is featured on the new Supreme Court website,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk |title=The Supreme Court |publisher=The Supreme Court |access-date=16 May 2010}}</ref> as well as in the forms that will be used by the Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web |title=Notice of appeal (or application for permission to appeal) |url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/sc001_0409x1.pdf |website=www.supremecourt.uk}}</ref> A further variant omits the crown entirely and is featured prominently throughout the building.<ref>{{cite news|title=In pictures: UK Supreme Court|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/8151625.stm|work=BBC News|date=15 July 2009|access-date=18 August 2009}}</ref>
[[File:UK Supreme Court badge 2.svg|thumb|upright|The Blake emblem with stylised depictions of the four floral emblems.]]
Another emblem is formed from a more abstract set of depictions of the four floral emblems and is used in the carpets of the Middlesex Guildhall designed by [[Peter Blake (artist)|Sir Peter Blake]], creator of such works as the cover of [[The Beatles]]' 1967 album, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Inside the UK Supreme Court|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8152427.stm|work=BBC News|date=15 July 2009|access-date=18 August 2009}}</ref>
