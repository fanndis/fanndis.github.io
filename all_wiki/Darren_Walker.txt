At the Rockefeller Foundation, Walker led the foundation’s work in the United States and globally - in supporting innovations that built economic development, sustainability and assets of poor and disadvantaged people - while creating long-term strategies that addressed increasing global migration, movements and urbanization. He also oversaw the foundation’s new strategy and vision for New York City, including directing the Rockefeller Foundation's support of the re-building of [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/uploads/files/e0601fcc-8073-4692-8ebe-16b8d16c37d5.pdf |title= New Orleans: Planning for a Better Future |publisher= Rockefeller Foundation |accessdate= April 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philanthropynewsdigest.org/5-questions-for/darren-walker-rockefeller-foundation |title= Darren Walker, Vice President of Foundation Initiatives, Rockefeller Foundation |publisher= Philanthropy News Digest |accessdate= April 27, 2014}}</ref>

===Operation Detroit===
 	
Walker spearheaded efforts to save the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] and city workers' pensions in the [[Detroit bankruptcy]] process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordfoundation.org/newsroom/news-from-ford/842 |title= A Statement to the People of Detroit |publisher= Ford Foundation Newsroom |accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/7914/is_the_ford_foundation_s_darren_walker_the_savior_of_detroit#.U18L26LQvyQ |title= Is The Ford Foundation's Darren Walker The Savior Of Detroit? |publisher= Deadline Detroit, Inc. |accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> Walker stated that it was "unprecedented and monumental for philanthropies to undertake this kind of initiative, but if there was ever a time when philanthropy should step up, this is it."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbnpov.com/?p=1418 |title= Detroit Bankruptcy: Struggling city ready for comeback |publisher= Point of View |accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref>
 	
Walker led nine foundations, many with ties to Michigan - including [[Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan]], [[William Davidson Foundation]], [[Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation]], [[Ford Foundation]], [[Hudson-Webber Foundation]], [[Kresge Foundation]], [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]], [[McGregor Fund]], and [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]]. These US [[Private foundation|foundation]]s "have pledged to pool the $330 million, which would essentially relieve the city-owned Detroit Institute of Arts museum of its responsibility to sell some of its collection to help Detroit pay its $18 billion in debts. In particular, the foundation money would help reduce a portion of the city’s obligations to retirees, whose pensions are at risk of being reduced in the bankruptcy proceedings. By some estimates, the city’s pensions are underfunded by $3.5 billion."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/14/us/300-million-pledged-to-save-detroits-art-collection.html?_r=0 |title= Foundations Aim to Save Pensions in Detroit Crisis|work= New York Times |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref> Walker's Ford Foundation pledged to provide $125 million for the $330 million common fund from the nine foundations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://createquity.com/2014/02/to-save-detroit-institute-of-arts-no-cost-too-great.html |title= To save Detroit Institute of Arts, no cost too great? |publisher= Createquity |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/28/foundation-adds-40m-to-detroit-deal/4989239 |title= Foundation adds $40M to Detroit deal |publisher= USA Today |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref>
