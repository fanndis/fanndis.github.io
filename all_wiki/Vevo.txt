These views are believed to have been earned during the final weeks leading up to the December 8, 2009, launch. In early 2013, these views were subtracted from various Vevo channels, most notably Lady Gaga's Vevo channel. The affected videos include the "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" video, which lost more than half of its existing views. Other affected videos include "[[Heartless (Kanye West song)|Heartless]]" and "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]", whose graphs showed similar traces of inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://readwrite.com/2013/01/28/youtube-bot-vevo-videos-lady-gaga-spk/|title=Did YouTube Buy Fake VEVO Video Views?|author=Fruzsina Eordogh|date=28 Jan 2013|website=readwrite}}</ref>

In April 2018, Vevo's YouTube channel was hacked by two hackers using the name of Prosox and Kuroi'SH and caused the renaming of many videos and the deletion of the most viewed YouTube video, "[[Despacito]]" by [[Luis Fonsi]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/10/17220114/vevo-hack-despacito-youtube|title=Vevo's channel was hacked, not YouTube — there's a difference|work=Polygon|access-date=April 24, 2018}}</ref>

===Vevo TV===
On March 15, 2013, Vevo launched '''Vevo TV''', an [[Internet television]] channel running 24 hours a day, featuring blocks of music videos and specials. The channel was only available to viewers in North America and Germany, with [[Geo-blocking|geographical]] [[IP address blocking]] being used to enforce the restriction. Vevo had planned launches in other countries.<ref name=vevotv-launch>{{cite web|title=Beyond on-demand: Vevo launches Vevo TV, an MTV-inspired linear music video channel|url=https://thenextweb.com/media/2013/03/12/vevo-launches-vevo-tv-an-mtv-inspired-linear-music-video-channel/|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=March 12, 2013}}</ref> After revamping its website, Vevo TV later branched off into three separate networks: '''Hits''', '''Flow''' (hip hop and R&B), and '''Nashville''' (country music).<ref>{{cite web|first=Elyse|last=Betters|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/124825-vevo-s-been-rebuilt-major-redesign-launched-for-web-and-mobile-web|title=Vevo's been rebuilt: Major redesign launched for web and mobile web|work=Pocket-Lint|date=November 3, 2013|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}</ref> Vevo shut down the service during the first half of 2016 as part of a site wide redesign.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vevo Gets a Redesign, Ditches Flash Video & Vevo TV|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7350238/vevo-gets-a-redesign-ditches-flash-video-vevo-tv|website=Billboard|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}</ref>

Vevo TV ran on an automated schedule, similar to video-exclusive networks run by [[Viacom Media Networks]]. Music videos would play twice within an hour and original programming, such as ''Top 10 Now'' and ''Vevo Lift'', would air several times per day. After rebranding in 2016, Vevo TV was slowly phased out. Vevo's mobile app continued to run the channel until they were relaunched later that year.

The '''24-Hour Vevo Record''', commonly referred to as the '''Vevo Record''', is the record for the most views a music video associated with Vevo has received within 24 hours of its release. The video that currently holds this record is [[Taylor Swift]]'s "[[Me!]]" with 65.2 million views.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Vevo/status/1068980708696342531|title=Vevo on Twitter|website=Twitter|language=en|access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref>

In 2012, [[Nicki Minaj]]'s "[[Stupid Hoe]]" became one of the first Vevo music videos to receive a significant amount of media attention upon its release day, during which it accumulated 4.8 million views. The record has consistently been kept track of by Vevo ever since. Total views of a video are counted from across all of Vevo's platforms, including YouTube, [[Yahoo!]] and other syndication partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=On Breaking The 24 Hour Views Record|url=http://vevo.tumblr.com/post/68805707209/on-breaking-the-24-hour-views-record|publisher=Vevo}}</ref>

On April 14, 2013, [[Psy]]'s "[[Gentleman (Psy song)|Gentleman]]" unofficially broke the record by reaching 38.4 million views in its first 24 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2013/4/psy-secures-new-youtube-world-record-with-gentleman-48291|title=PSY secures new YouTube world record with "Gentleman"|publisher=Guinness World Records}}</ref> However, this record was not acknowledged by Vevo because it was not associated with them until four days after its release to YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/1557490/psys-gentleman-gains-70-million-youtube-views-in-3-days-breaks|title=PSY's 'Gentleman' Gains 70 Million YouTube Views in 3 Days, Breaks Single-Day Record|website=Billboard}}</ref> Both the YouTube and Vevo records were eventually eclipsed by Taylor Swift's "[[Look What You Made Me Do]]" on August 28, 2017, which gained 43.2 million views in 24 hours.

On December 1, 2018, [[Ariana Grande]]'s "[[Thank U, Next (song)|Thank U, Next]]" beat Swift's record in Vevo, accumulating 55.4 million views in 24 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-youtube-record-video-views-1203071119/|title=Ariana Grande's 'Thank U, Next' Video Breaks YouTube Record for Most Views in 24 Hours|first1=Todd|last1=Spangler|date=December 1, 2018}}</ref>

Swift then took the award again on April 27, 2019 when her video for "Me!" garnered 65.2 million views in 24 hours.

[[Taylor Swift]]<!--record belongs to channel owner artist--> is the only artist to break the record three times on her channel. [[One Direction]], [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Miley Cyrus]], have all broken the record twice.
