'''''The Daily Beast''''' is an <!--do not insert left-wing or other political orientations, these edits have been rejected earlier. Please discuss them at the talk page-->American news publication focused on politics, media and pop culture.  In a 2015 interview, former [[editor-in-chief]] [[John Avlon]] described the ''Beast''{{'}}s editorial approach: "We seek out scoops, scandals, and stories about secret worlds; we love confronting bullies, bigots, and hypocrites." In 2018, Avlon described the ''Beast''{{'}}s "strike zone" as "politics, pop culture, and power".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/the-daily-beast-is-buzzing-with-solid-scoops-and-an-editor-who-knows-how-to-spread-the-word/ |title=The Daily Beast is buzzing with solid scoops and an editor who knows how to spread the word |last=McLaughlin |first=Aidan |date=April 24, 2018 |website=Mediaite |access-date=May 7, 2018 |quote=It doesn't hurt that the Trump presidency manages to sit squarely within what Avlon calls the Daily Beast's 'strike zone' of 'politics, pop culture, and power'.

==History==
''The Daily Beast'' began publishing on October 6, 2008. Its founding editor was [[Tina Brown]], a former editor of [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']] and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as well as the short-lived [[Talk (magazine)|''Talk'']] magazine. Brown stepped down as editor in September 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/11/tina-brown-steps-down-daily-beast-editor |title=Tina Brown steps down after tumultuous tenure at ''Daily Beast'' |date=11 September 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |place=London, UK}}</ref> [[John Avlon]], an American journalist and political commentator as well as a [[CNN]] contributor, was the site's editor-in-chief and managing director from 2013 to 2018.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2018/05/24/john-avlon-joins-cnn-full-time-as-senior-political-analyst-with-regular-daily-presence-on-new-day/ |title=John Avlon Joins CNN Full Time as Senior Political Analyst, with Regular Daily Presence on New Day |date=May 24, 2018 |publisher=CNN Press Room |access-date=June 3, 2018 |quote=Most recently, Avlon was Editor-in-Chief of ''The Daily Beast'' since 2013, succeeding the site's founder Tina Brown.

In 2010, ''The Daily Beast'' merged with the magazine ''[[Newsweek]]'' creating a combined company, [[The Newsweek Daily Beast Company]]. The merger ended in 2013, when ''Daily Beast'' owner [[IAC (company)|IAC]] sold ''Newsweek'' to [[IBT Media]], owner of the ''[[International Business Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/08/iac-found-someone-to-buy-newsweek.html |title=IAC found someone to buy zombie Newsweek |date=3 August 2013  |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |series=Daily Intelligencer}}</ref>

In September 2014, ''The Daily Beast'' reached a new record of 21&nbsp;million unique visitors – a 60% year-over-year increase in readers, accompanied by a 300% increase in the overall size of its social media community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/10/one-year-after-tina-brown-exit-daily-beast-traffic-196426.html |title=One year after Tina Brown exit, ''Daily Beast'' traffic surges |first=Hadas |last=Gold |date=1 October 2014 |website=Politico}}</ref>

In May&nbsp;2018 Avlon departed from the ''Beast'' to become full-time Senior Political Analyst and anchor at [[CNN]].

In March&nbsp;2017 former chief strategy and product officer Mike Dyer left for [[Intel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/media/story/2017/03/daily-beast-president-leaving-to-join-intel-004937 |title=Daily Beast president leaving to join Intel |last=Gold |first=Hadas |authorlink=Hadas Gold |date=3 March 2017 |website=Politico.com |accessdate=7 June 2017 |quote=Daily Beast president and publisher Mike Dyer is leaving the company for a new position at technology firm Intel, he announced to staff on Friday.}}</ref> In May&nbsp;2017, Heather Dietrick was appointed president and publisher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iac.com/media-room/press-releases/daily-beast-appoints-heather-dietrick-president-and-publisher |title=''The Daily Beast'' appoints Heather Dietrick as president and publisher |date=18 May 2017 |publisher=IAC |accessdate=7 June 2017 |quote=Today, ''The Daily Beast'' announced the appointment of Heather Dietrick as President and Publisher, where she will oversee all company operations with an emphasis on growing ''The Daily Beast''{{'}}s journalistic influence and building out new revenue streams.}}</ref>

==Editorial stance==
In an April&nbsp;2018 interview, Avlon described the publication's political stance as "non-partisan but not neutral": "what that means is we're going to hit both sides where appropriate, but we're not going for mythic moral equivalence on every issue."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/the-daily-beast-is-buzzing-with-solid-scoops-and-an-editor-who-knows-how-to-spread-the-word/ |title=''The Daily Beast'' is buzzing with solid scoops and an editor who knows how to spread the eord |last=McLaughlin |first =Aidan |date=April 24, 2018|website=Mediaite |access-date=May 9, 2018 |quote='I describe our political perspective as nonpartisan but not neutral,' he said.

But we're also not going to pretend there's a mythic moral equivalence between candidates or on any given issue. For me, the key quote for our times is actually an older quote from Daniel Patrick Moynihan who said that everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts.}}</ref> In December&nbsp;2017, [[NPR]] reported that ''The Daily Beast''{{'}}s editor-in-chief John Avlon had begun pairing reporters from both the right and left sides of the [[political spectrum]] to cover [[White House]] stories. Specifically, reporters Asawin Suebsaeng (formerly of ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'') and Lachlan Markay (formerly of [[The Heritage Foundation]]) were tasked with covering the [[Trump Administration]].<ref>C-Span (13 February 2020).

==Controversies==

===Plagiarism===
In February 2010, [[Jack Shafer]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine claimed that the chief investigative reporter for ''The Daily Beast'', [[Gerald Posner]], had plagiarised five sentences from an article published by the ''[[Miami Herald]]''. Shafer also discovered that Posner had plagiarized content from a ''Miami Herald'' blog, a ''Miami Herald'' editorial, ''Texas Lawyer'' magazine and a health care journalism blog.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2010/02/plagiarism_at_the_daily_beast.html "Plagiarism at the Daily Beast: Gerald Posner concedes lifting from the Miami Herald"].

===Taliban denouncement===
A 2013 article about the [[Taliban]] seeking peaceful negotiations in Afghanistan prompted a direct response from the organization. The Taliban denounced the article as false and claimed ''The Daily Beast'' violated the basic principles of journalism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jihadology.net/category/individuals/leaders/zabihullah-mujahid/page/5/?iframe=true&theme_preview=true%2Ffeed%2F |title=New statement from the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan's Zabīhullah Mujāhid: 'Remarks Regarding the Baseless Report by 'The Daily Beast{{"'}} |last=Mujāhid |first=Zabīhullah |date=November 3, 2013 |website=jihadology.net |publisher=Jihadology |access-date=October 15, 2017 |quote=We reject every aspect of this report.

=== Doxing ===
In June 2019, ''The Daily Beast'' reporter [[Kevin Poulsen]] was accused of [[doxing]] Shawn Brooks, a 34-year-old [[Trump supporter]] living in [[the Bronx]], when Poulsen revealed his identity in an article published on June 1, 2019 for being the alleged creator and disseminator of a fake video, which showed [[Nancy Pelosi]] speaking in a slurred manner.<ref name=":3">{{cite web |last1=Miles |first1=Frank |title=Daily Beast accused of 'doxxing' alleged creator of 'Drunk Pelosi' video |url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/daily-beast-facing-backlash-for-outing-alleged-creator-of-drunk-pelosi-video |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=June 3, 2019 |date=June 2, 2019}}</ref><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/446621-man-accused-of-creating-fake-pelosi-video-plans-to-sue-daily-beast|title=Man accused of creating fake Pelosi video plans to sue Daily Beast|last=Conradis|first=Brandon|date=2019-06-03|website=TheHill|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref> Hours after being posted on May 22, 2019, the fake video had been shared over 60,000 times on [[Facebook]] and had more than 4 million views.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cjr.org/analysis/daily-beast-drunk-pelosi.php|title=Should The Daily Beast have exposed the man behind 'drunk Pelosi' video?|last=Ingram|first=Mathew|date=June 3, 2019|website=Columbia Journalism Review|url-status=live|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> The fake video also spread to [[Twitter]] and [[YouTube]], but was taken down on YouTube after the video was shown to be fake.<ref name=":2" /> As of June 4, 2019, the fake video on Facebook had been removed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/5351057/distorted-nancy-pelosi-video-removed/|title=Doctored Nancy Pelosi video disappears from Facebook|last=Joseph|first=Rebecca|date=2019-06-04|website=Global News|url-status=live|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>

''[[The Intercept]]'' co-founder [[Glenn Greenwald]] criticized ''The Daily Beast'' for revealing Brooks' identity, saying on Twitter it was "repellent to unleash the resources of a major news outlet on an obscure, anonymous, powerless, quasi-unemployed citizen for the crime of trivially mocking the most powerful political leaders".<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> ''[[HuffPost]]'' and ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' contributor [[Yashar Ali]] also criticized ''The Daily Beast'' for revealing Brooks' identity, saying it "sets a really bad precedent when a private citizen has their identity publicly revealed simply because they made a video of a politician appearing to be drunk".<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":0" /> ''[[The Daily Wire]]'' [[editor-in-chief]] [[Ben Shapiro]] said on [[Laura Ingraham]]'s ''[[The Ingraham Angle]]'' on June 3 that "My impression was that if you are posting anonymously on Facebook, then it's not really within Facebook's purvey <i>(sic)</i> to start handing that information to media outlets, but I guess that isn't true".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ben-shapiro-slams-vile-and-angry-left-media-in-doxxing-case-involving-drunken-pelosi-creator|title=Ben Shapiro slams 'vile and angry left' media in doxxing case involving 'Drunken Pelosi' creator|last=Wallace|first=Danielle|date=2019-06-04|website=Fox News|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref>

Other journalists who criticized ''The Daily Beast'' include [[freelance journalist]] and former ''[[The Young Turks]]'' journalist Michael Tracey, who said on Twitter that "No one on the planet ever thought "disinformation is the purview of Russia alone" other than self-aggrandizing, sleazy, click-chasing Daily Beast journalists", and media editor for ''[[TheWrap]]'' [[John R. Levine|Jon Levine]], who called the article a "hit job over a joke video that happened to go viral".<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

When ''The Daily Beast'' editor [[Noah Shachtman]] was asked about these criticisms by [[CNN]] media reporter [[Brian Stelter]] on his "[[Reliable Sources]]" show on June 2, 2019, Shachtman defended the article, noting that the fake video had reached "the highest levels of power, with Rudy Giuliani himself tweeting it out" and therefore, according to Shachtman, it was worth identifying the creator of the fake video.<ref name=":0" />

In response, Shawn Brooks denied creating the fake video, despite admitting to being one of the administrators of the group Politics WatchDog who had originally posted the video and blamed a "female admin" of the group.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Brooks said that he would sue ''The Daily Beast'' and Poulsen for publishing "inaccurate trash", and created a [[GoFundMe]] page to raise money for [[legal costs]], with a goal of raising $10,000.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/man-accused-of-faking-drunk-pelosi-video-wants-to-sue-reporter-who-outed-him/|title=Man accused of faking 'drunk Pelosi' video wants to sue reporter who outed him|date=June 4, 2019|website=The Times of Israel|url-status=live|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref> As of the morning of June 3, 2019, he had raised more than $4,400.<ref name=":1" />
