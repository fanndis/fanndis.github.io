According to a recent case in August 2020, Bloomberg LP is again being charged with discrimination against blacks, and against non-white workers. Nafeesa Syeed, who served at Bloomberg for around four years as a national security reporter and Middle East reporter, sued the corporation in New York city court for sexism based on her gender and her ethnicity as a South Asian-American. Bloomberg faces a related complaint by a former saleswoman, who filed under a pseudonym in June and the corporation is now seeking to compel a public release of her name. Throughout both cases the same law firm defends the victims.<ref>{{Cite web|date=11 August 2020|title=Bloomberg LP Hit With More Discrimination Claims by Former Reporter|url=https://wwd.com/business-news/media/bloomberg-lp-sued-for-gender-race-discrimination-1203697697/|access-date=13 August 2020|website=WWD}}</ref>
