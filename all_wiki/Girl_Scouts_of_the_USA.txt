'''Girl Scouts of the United States of America''' ('''GSUSA'''), commonly referred to as simply '''Girl Scouts''', is a [[youth organization]] for girls in the United States and American girls living abroad.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Maurer |first=Elizabeth |date=June 2017 |title=What Did Girls Want?

Girl Scouts prepares girls to empower themselves and promotes compassion, courage, confidence, character, leadership, entrepreneurship, and active [[citizenship]] through activities involving [[camping]], [[community service]], learning [[first aid]], and earning badges by acquiring practical skills. Girl Scouts' achievements are recognized with various special awards, including the Girl Scout Gold, Silver, and Bronze Awards.

Girl Scout membership is organized according to grade, with activities designed for each level. GSUSA is a member of the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS) and accepts girls of all backgrounds.

A 1994 ''[[Chronicle of Philanthropy]]'' poll showed Girl Scouts ranked by the public as the eighth "most popular charity/non-profit in America" among more than 100 charities.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=1996-12-13 |title=The Charities Americans Like Most and Least |journal=The Chronicle of Philanthropy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=1994-12-20 |title=Charity Begins with Health |page=01D |publisher=USA Today}}</ref> It describes itself as "the world's preeminent organization dedicated solely to girls."<ref>{{Cite web |year=2008 |title=About Girl Scouts of the USA |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are |access-date=2008-02-23 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref>

==History ==

=== Girl Guides of America ===
[[File:Juliette Gordon Low dai.jpg|thumb|right|[[Juliette Gordon Low]] (center), with two Girl Scouts.]]
Girl Scouting in the United States of America began on March 12, 1912, when [[Juliette Gordon Low|Juliette "Daisy" Gordon Low]] organized the first Girl Guide troop meeting of 18 girls in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia. It has since grown to 3.7 million members.<ref name="JGL" /> Low, who had met [[Baden-Powell]] in London while she was living in the United Kingdom, dreamed of giving the United States and the world "something for all the girls." She envisioned an organization that would bring girls out of their homes to serve their communities, experience the out-of-doors, and have the opportunity to develop "self-reliance and resourcefulness." From its inception, the Girl Scouts has been organized and run exclusively by women, for girls and women.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Aickin Rothschild |first=Mary |date=Autumn 1981 |title=To Scout or to Guide? The Girl Scout-Boy Scout Controversy, 1912-1941 |journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=115–121 |doi=10.2307/3346224 |jstor=3346224}}</ref>

Juliette Gordon Low was the granddaughter of Juliette Magill Kinzie and John Harris Kinzie, whose childhood family was one of the earliest settlers of Chicago, IL. Juliette Kinzie wrote about her experiences in the Northwest Territory (now the state of Wisconsin) in her book ''Wau-Bun: The Early Day''. Some of what her granddaughter, Juliette Gordon Low, knew firsthand about her grandmother's experiences on the frontier were incorporated into the beginnings and traditions of Girl Scouts. The early home of Juliette Low's grandparents can be visited May 15 through October 15 in [[Portage, Wisconsin]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=FORT WINNEBAGO'S HISTORIC INDIAN AGENCY HOUSE |url=http://www.agencyhouse.org |access-date=2016-03-12}}</ref>

In late 1912, Low proposed that the [[Camp Fire Girls]] merge with the Girl Guides but was rejected in January 1913 as Camp Fire was then the larger group. Next, Low attempted to merge her organization with the [[Girl Scouts of America]] which was founded in Des Moines, Iowa by [[Clara Lisetor-Lane]]. She thought their similarities would make this easier but Lisetor-Lane felt Daisy copycatted her organization and threatened to sue. Lisetor-Lane later claimed Low's organization was luring members away but the GSA's growth was limited by a lack of financial resources which led to its eventual demise.<ref name="chirhart2007">{{Cite book |last1=Chirhart |first1=Ann Short |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqU2PsmlYpMC&pg=PA381 |title=Georgia Women: Their Lives and Times |last2=Wood |first2=Betty |date=2007 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=9780820339009 |page=381}}</ref>

=== Girl Scouts of the United States===
[[File:SaturdayEveningPost25Oct1924.jpg|thumb|Cover story from ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' on the Girl Scouts (25 Oct 1924)]]
The Girl Guides of America in 1913 changed its name to Girl Scouts of the United States and moved its headquarters to [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name="chirhart2007" /> In 1915 the organization was incorporated<ref name="preuss">{{Cite book |last=Preuss |first=Arthur |url=https://archive.org/details/PreussPDF |title=A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies |publisher=B. Herder Book Co. |year=1924 |location=St. Louis |page=[https://archive.org/details/PreussPDF/page/n218 152] |quote=republished Detroit: Gale Reference Company 1966}}</ref> and the national headquarters was moved to [[New York City]].<ref name = chirhart2007 /> The name reached its current form, Girl Scouts of the United States of America, in 1947. The organization was given a [[congressional charter]] on March 16, 1950.

GSUSA started with 18 members. Within months, members were hiking through the woods in knee-length blue uniforms, playing basketball on a curtained-off court, and going on camping trips. In 1916, Low established an aviation badge—even before women could vote. By 1920, there were nearly 70,000 members.<ref name="Who We Are">{{Cite web |year=2013 |title=Who We Are: Facts |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/facts/ |access-date=July 10, 2013 |publisher=Girl Scouts of The USA}}</ref> By 1923 the organization had branches in every state in the union, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, and a total membership of 125,738.<ref name="preuss" /> In 1930 it had over 200,000. In 2013 there were over 3.2&nbsp;million Girl Scouts: 2.3 million girl members and 890,000 adult members in the United States.<ref name="Who We Are" /> More than 50&nbsp;million American women have participated in Girl Scouts. Through its membership in [[WAGGGS]], GSUSA girls and adults are among over 10 million members in 146 countries.<ref name="Who We Are" />

The names and ages of the [[Girl Scout levels (USA)|levels]] and the larger structure of the program have changed significantly over time. In 1923 Girl Scouts were organized into patrols, troops, local councils, and the National Council.<ref name="preuss" /> Troops were initially fairly independent before joining together into small councils, which recently merged to form larger councils. Today there are over 100 councils across the U.S.<ref name="Who We Are" />

The [[Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace]], located in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia, in the former Gordon family home, became the national Girl Scout program center in 1956.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Girl Scouting in Indiana |url=http://www.statelib.lib.in.us/www/ihb/publications/girlscout.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015143935/http://www.statelib.lib.in.us/www/ihb/publications/girlscout.pdf |archive-date=October 15, 2006 |access-date=November 4, 2006 |publisher=The Indiana Historian |df=mdy}}</ref> It provides tours to thousands of Girl Scouts yearly.

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], 1943–1945, many young Japanese American girls were confined in [[Japanese American internment|internment]] camps with their families. Girl Scout troops were organized, even in these camps. These girls participated in many activities, including dramatic presentations that took place in the [[Crystal City Internment Camp]] in [[Crystal City, Texas|Crystal City]], Texas.

===Desegregation===
Most Girl Scout units were originally [[Racial segregation|segregated]] by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] according to state and local laws and customs. The first troop for African American girls was founded in 1917; the first [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] troop was formed in [[New York State]] in 1921; and the first troop for [[Mexican Americans]] was formed in [[Houston]], Texas, in 1922. In 1933, Josephine Groves Holloway founded unofficial African American troops in [[Tennessee]]. She also fully desegregated the Cumberland Valley council in 1962.<ref name="groves">{{Cite book |last=Elisabeth Israels Perry |url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=641 |title=Josephine Groves Holloway |work=Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture |others=Tennessee Historical Society, Nashville, Tenn. |year=2002 |edition=Online |access-date=2006-09-08 |orig-year=1998}}</ref> The first official African American troop in the South was founded in 1932 in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Virginia by Lena B. Watson and led initially by Lavnia Banks, a teacher from Armstrong High School. It first met in Hartshorn Hall at [[Virginia Union University]].<ref>{{Cite web |year=2008 |title=Girl Scout Commonwealth Council to celebrate and honor first African-American Troop in the South |url=http://www.comgirlscouts.org/News%20Room/vuu.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326055255/http://www.comgirlscouts.org/News%20Room/vuu.pdf |archive-date=March 26, 2009 |access-date=December 19, 2008}}</ref>

By the 1950s, GSUSA had begun significant national efforts to desegregate the camps and maintain racial balance. One of the first desegregations, accomplished by [[Murray Atkins Walls]] in 1956, was Camp Shantituck in [[Kentucky]].<ref name="walls">{{Cite book |url=http://www.state.ky.us/agencies2/kchr/pdf/Winter%20newsletter%202005.pdf |title=Human Rights Report: New Great Black Kentuckian poster unveiled |date=Winter 2005 |publisher=Kentucky Commission on Human Rights |page=3 |access-date=September 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923073929/http://www.state.ky.us/agencies2/kchr/pdf/Winter%20newsletter%202005.pdf |archive-date=September 23, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Later the same year, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] described Girl Scouts as "a force for desegregation".<ref name="gordonlow">{{Cite web |last=Montgomery |first=Dana |year=2006 |title=Getting to Know Juliette Gordon Low |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/for_adults/leader_magazine/2006_spring/getting_to_know_jgl.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929124332/http://www.girlscouts.org/for_adults/leader_magazine/2006_spring/getting_to_know_jgl.asp |archive-date=September 29, 2006 |access-date=September 8, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref> In 1969, a national Girl Scout initiative called Action 70 was created that aimed to eliminate [[prejudice]].

=== Wing Scouts===
{{Main|Wing Scout}}
The '''Wing Scout''' program was a Senior Girl Scout program for girls interested in flying and wanting to serve their country that started in 1941 and ended in the 1970s. In July 1942, 29 troop leaders from 15 states met in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, to take Wing Scout leadership training. They returned to their councils and began setting up Wing Scout troops. In 1959, the Girl Scout council in North [[San Mateo County]], California, was presented with an offer from [[United Airlines]] San Francisco Management Club President J. L. Burnside to start an aviation program for Senior Girl Scouts. One of the highlights of the Wing Scout program was the courtesy flight provided to Senior Girl Scouts using United Airlines' jets. For many of the girls, this was the first time they had flown in a [[airplane|plane]]. Senior Girl Scouts who had been in the program for three years were given the opportunity to take over the controls during flight in a small aircraft. The program was discontinued after [[United Airlines]] experienced financial setbacks in the 1970s.<ref name="wings1">{{Cite book |title=Highlights in Girl Scout 1912-1996 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |year=1996}} GSP154.2001</ref>

The program was originally for girls ages 10 to 18, but it was subsequently divided into three levels. [[Brownie (Girl Guides)|Brownies]] (for younger girls) was based on a program developed in England in 1914 and was officially recognized in the mid-1920s. At the same time, girls over 18, or over 16 if First Class Scouts, became known as Senior Scouts. In 1938, the age divisions were: Brownies (ages 7 through 9), Intermediates (ages 10 through 13), and Seniors (ages 14 through 18).<ref name="GSUSA Timeline">{{Cite web |title=Timeline of GSUSA - 1930s |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/history/timeline/1930s.asp |access-date=November 2, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref>

In 1965 the age structure was rearranged to Brownies (ages 7 and 8, or 2nd and 3rd grades), Juniors (ages 9 through 11, or 4th through 6th grades), Cadettes (ages 11 through 14, or 7th through 9th grades), and Seniors (ages 14 through 18, or 10th through 12th grades).<ref name="GSUSA Timeline1960s">{{Cite web |title=Timeline of GSUSA 1970s |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/history/timeline/1970s.asp |access-date=November 2, 2004 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref> In the early 1970s, the Brownie level was extended to girls six years old or in the first grade, and the [[Membership levels of the Girl Scouts of the USA#Girl Scout Daisies|Daisy]] program for [[kindergarten]] girls or those age five was introduced in 1984.<ref name="GSUSA Timeline1970s">{{Cite web |title=Timeline of GSUSA - 1980s |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/history/timeline/1980s.asp |access-date=November 2, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref> The Daisy program began as a pilot program called Pixies in 1976.

In 2003, the [[Studio 2B]] program for girls ages 11 to 17 was introduced for Cadettes and Seniors.<ref name="GSUSA TimelineToday">{{Cite web |title=Timeline of GSUSA&nbsp;— Today |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/history/timeline/today.asp |access-date=November 2, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref> Studio 2B allowed girls to call themselves by any name of their choosing, including but not limited to "Studio 2Bs,"<ref>{{Cite web |title=STUDIO 2B…The Excitement Is Spreading |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/studio2b/studio2b_quickreference.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228113814/http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/studio2b/studio2b_quickreference.pdf |archive-date=February 28, 2005 |access-date=November 7, 2018}}</ref> "teen Girl Scouts," or Cadettes and Seniors. Under the Studio 2B programs, girls were able to work on traditional badges as well as Studio 2B activities, and the Silver Award and Gold Award requirements were rewritten to require both. Studio 2B activities differed from badges in two ways: each booklet focused on a topic such as environmentalism or self-confidence rather than being skill-based like a [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|badge]]; and to earn each Studio 2B charm, the Girl Scout had to choose activities from the booklet and then meet a goal relevant to the booklet topic. She would create her own plan for achieving her goal, following a basic planning procedure called [[SMART (project management)|SMART]] (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely).

On October 1, 2008, all levels were renamed to have "Girl Scout" as the beginning of their name, e.g., Girl Scout Brownies instead of Brownie Girl Scouts, and all levels are by grade only instead of by age or grade. A new level, Girl Scout Ambassadors, was created for girls in [[Educational stages|grades]] 11 and 12 (around 16 to 18 years old), with Girl Scout Seniors to be only in ninth and tenth grade (around 14 to 16 years old), and sixth grade girls were reclassified from the Junior level to Cadette to conform with school grade levels. (By this time, sixth grade was considered a middle school rather than an elementary school grade.) The new levels were tried in approximately six councils in spring 2008 and were put to use nationally after October 1, 2008.

Although troop membership has always and is still the most common way to participate in Girl Scouting, girls who do not have a local troop, or who do not desire or have the time to participate in traditional troop activities, can still sign up as individual Girl Scouts. Individual Girls Scouts were known in the early years of Girl Scouting as Lone Scouts and later as Juliettes; they attend activities independently and work individually on badges and awards. In 2015–2016, the term Juliette was phased out at the national level, in favor of the term Independent Girl Scouts, although some councils still use the term Juliette.

The [[Campus Girl Scouts]] program allows women (ages 18 and older) to be active in Girl Scouting while in college. Campus Girl Scouting is an organization that helps promote and build student involvement in the community, the local council, and the college campus through service.<ref name="gsusacampus">{{Cite web |title=Campus Girl Scouts |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/join/campus |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819145031/http://www.girlscouts.org/join/campus |archive-date=August 19, 2006 |access-date=September 25, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref>

===Mariner Scouts===
The 20th National Council of GSUSA launched the Mariner Girl Scout program in October 1934.<ref name="vintagemariner">{{Cite web |title=Vintage Girl Scout Online Museum |url=http://www.vintagegirlscout.com/unimariner.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031234227/http://www.vintagegirlscout.com/unimariner.htm |archive-date=October 31, 2007 |access-date=October 28, 2007 |website=Mariner Girl Scouts |publisher=Vintage Girl Scouts}}</ref> Similar to the [[Boy Scouts of America]]'s [[Sea Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouting]], the program was designed for older Girl Scouts interested in outdoor water-based activities. By the end of 1934, 12 Mariner ships were registered and the first two handbooks, ''Launching a Girl Scout Mariner Ship'' and ''Charting the Course of a Girl Scout Mariner Ship,'' were published. The Mariner Girl Scout program remains active but in a smaller form; most girls have instead joined Sea Scouting, which has been coed since 1971.<ref name="troop1440">{{Cite web |title=History of Girl Scouts |url=http://cheesecakeandfriends.com/troop1440/history.htm |access-date=October 28, 2007 |publisher=Troop 1440}}</ref>

===Special programs===
There are programs for girls in very unusual situations that make it difficult for them to participate in the standard given programs. The Girl Scouts "Beyond Bars program" helps daughters of incarcerated mothers connect with their mothers and helps mothers participate in Girl Scout activities. Another program, Girl Scouting in Detention Centers, allows girls who are themselves in detention centers to participate in Scouting. Other initiatives try to help girls in rural areas or in public housing. There are also programs for American girls living overseas.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Goddard |first=Jennifer |year=2003 |title=Where Girls Go, Girl Scouting Follows |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/for_adults/leader_magazine/2003_spring/where_girls_go.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929124021/http://www.girlscouts.org/for_adults/leader_magazine/2003_spring/where_girls_go.asp |archive-date=September 29, 2006 |access-date=September 25, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts Cross Timbers Council}}</ref>

==Organizational structure==
[[File:Girl Scouts of Connecticut building.jpg|thumb|Girl Scouts of Connecticut, Hartford, Connecticut]]
The national organization has its central headquarters in New York City. It is headed by a chief executive officer and a 40-member national board of directors. Judith Batty currently serves as the interim chief executive officer, and was officially appointed in August 2020. The chair of the national board of directors, the highest volunteer position, is Kathy Hopinkah Hannan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Girl Scouts - Official Web Site |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/ |access-date=March 12, 2016 |website=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref><ref name="dorn">{{cite news |last=Dorn |first=Angela |date=15 Aug 2020 |title=Judith Batty Makes History As First Black Woman To Lead Girl Scouts U.S. |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/angeladorn/2020/08/15/judith-batty-makes-history-as-first-black-woman-to-lead-girl-scouts-usa/#1bbe2a90688a |work=Forbes Media |location=Jersey City, NJ, USA |access-date=21 Sep 2020}}</ref>

Below the national organization are [[List of councils (Girl Scouts of the USA)|councils]], which cover a large portion of a state or geographic region. Some councils own and run camps for the troops within their area of responsibility. Councils are usually subdivided into areas, called neighborhoods, service units, or associations (terms vary), which are program delivery areas that consist of troops at all age levels in a smaller area, such as a town.

The basic unit is the troop which may or may not be sponsored. In contrast to Boy Scout troop-chartered organizations, Girl Scout troop sponsors do not own the troop. Troops range in size from as small as 5 to as large as 30 or more girls and may be divided into several patrols of 8 or fewer girls.

===Realignment===
In 2004, Girl Scouts of the USA hired a consultant "to help Girl Scouts develop a strategy to ensure our future success and growth." They set targets and implemented ways to change the organization for the better. In addition, six "gap teams" looked at ways Girl Scouts could improve its structure to prepare for future growth and success of the organization.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Girl Scouts&nbsp;— Core Business Strategy: Facts |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/strategy/facts.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112224613/http://www.girlscouts.org/strategy/facts.asp |archive-date=January 12, 2006 |access-date=July 21, 2010 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref> This followed declines in membership and in revenue, as well as challenges in subsidizing programs for inner-city girls. The governance gap team found that consolidation decreased confusion and provided economies of scale, and recommended an optimal council size of approximately 10,000 girls.<ref name="lb7.uscourts.gov">{{Cite web |title=Girl Scouts of Manitou Council Inc., v. Girl Scouts of United States of America Inc. |url=http://www.lb7.uscourts.gov/documents/WIED/08-cv-00184op.pdf |access-date=2016-03-12 |website=Lb7.uscourts.gov}}</ref> As of 2006, there were 312 regional Girl Scout councils, which own the 236,000 local troops and other groups.

As part of a 2006 reorganization, the national board of directors consolidated the 312 councils into 109 councils.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Girl Scouting Undergoes Historic Transformation to Focus on Leadership Development for 21st century Girls |date=September 18, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/news/news_releases/2006/historic_transformation.asp |access-date=September 26, 2006}}</ref>

This was not without resistance; the Manitou Girl Scout council in [[Wisconsin]] sued the national GSUSA in federal district court, alleging breach of the Girl Scout charter. Although the suit was summarily dismissed with prejudice by the district court,<ref name="lb7.uscourts.gov" /> the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh U.S. Circuit of Appeals]] overturned that decision, stating that a Girl Scout council agreement "was no different than a [[Dunkin' Donuts]] franchise." The decision of the appeals court maintained the status of the Manitou council. As a result, there are 112 Girl Scout councils in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Manitou Girl Scout Council proves to be one tough cookie |url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/122907563.html |website=jsonline.com}}</ref>

And to live by the Girl Scout Law.<ref name="Girl Scout Promise">{{Cite web |title=Girl Scout Promise and Law |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/promise_law/ |access-date=February 4, 2009 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref></poem></blockquote>

The Promise is often recited at Girl Scout troop meetings while holding up the [[Scout sign and salute|three middle fingers]] of the right hand, which forms the Girl Scout sign. Girl Scout policy states that the organization does not endorse or promote any particular philosophy or religious belief. The movement is nonsectarian, founded on American democratic principles, one of which is freedom of religion. In this context, the word "God" may be interpreted by each Girl Scout depending on her individual spiritual beliefs, and Girl Scouts are free to substitute the word consistent with their beliefs, such as "Creator," "my faith," "Allah," etc.<ref name="Nelson">{{Cite web |last=Nelson |first=Bill |title=What is the position of the GSUSA as related to God and religion? |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/scouting/rec.scouting.issues/section-25.html |access-date=September 25, 2006 |publisher=[rec.scouting.issues] Commonly asked questions}}</ref>

The aim of Girl Scouts is to help girls pursue four goals: develop to their full potential; relate to others with increasing understanding, skill, and respect; develop a meaningful set of values to guide their actions and make sound decisions; and contribute to the improvement of society.<ref name="gsusaprogram">{{Cite web |title=Girl Scout Program |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/program |access-date=September 29, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref>

The Girl Scout Law has been changed several times since 1912. The original Girl Scout Law written by Juliette Gordon Low was:<ref>{{Cite web |title=Girl Scout Law History |url=http://www.epilogsys.com/scoutingweb/SubPages/GSLawHis.htm |access-date=2016-03-12 |website=Epilogsys.com}}</ref>

The Girl Scout Law
# A Girl Scout's honor is to be trusted
# A Girl Scout is loyal

# A Girl Scout is a friend to all, and a sister to every other girl scout no matter to what social class she may belong
# A Girl Scout is courteous
# A Girl Scout keeps herself pure
# A Girl Scout is a friend to animals
# A Girl Scout obeys orders
# A Girl Scout is cheerful
# A Girl Scout is thrifty

===Girl Scout uniforms===
[[File:Girl Scout in uniform, 1973.JPG|thumb|Girl Scout in uniform, 1973]]

For girls ages 5 to 14, the unifying look includes wearing a choice of a tunic, vest, sash for displaying official pins and awards, combined with their own solid white shirts and khaki pants or skirts. Girl Scouts in high school can also wear a scarf that unites their look with the sisterhood of Girl Scouts around the world. For adult members the unifying look of the uniform is a Girl Scout official scarf or tie for men, worn with the official membership pins, combined with their own navy blue business attire. Girl Scouts at the Daisy and Brownie levels will continue to have a full uniform ensemble available.<ref name="girlscouts.org">{{Cite web |title=Where to Place Insignia - Girl Scouts |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/insignia/where_to_place/ |access-date=March 12, 2016 |website=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref>

Girl Scout uniforms have changed significantly over the years from the original navy blue in 1912, to khaki in 1914, to the familiar green. The evolution has included uniforms with the specificity to designate each age level of Girl Scouting. Since 2008, Girl Scouts at each level have one required element ([[tunic]], [[sash]] or vest) for the display of official pins and awards which will be required when girls participate in ceremonies or officially represent the Girl Scout Movement.

For all levels, earned awards go on the front of the vest or sash following official placements. Fun patches can be displayed on the back of a vest or sash. Girl Scout Daisies can choose a blue vest or a smock with a full uniform or white shirt and khaki pants and skirt. They have their own Daisy pin and a choice of accessories. Girl Scout Brownies can choose a traditional brown vest or sash to be worn with the historic Brownie pin and other uniform pieces or white shirt and khaki pants or skirts. Girl Scout Juniors wear their official vest or sash to display insignia including awards, coupled with a white shirt and khaki pants or skirt. Girl Scout Cadettes, Seniors, and Ambassadors can choose a khaki sash or vest to go with khaki pants or skirt and a white shirt.

The adult uniform also changed, with registered women and men wearing navy blue business attire, again from their regular wardrobes. Also available for women are official sweaters and an insignia scarf, while men have the option of an official tie.<ref name="girlscouts.org" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Uniform |url=http://www.girlscoutshop.com/gsusaonline/LandingPage.aspx?subCatId%3DUniform-Women%26menuItemId%3DUniform.5 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030165936/http://www.girlscoutshop.com/gsusaonline/LandingPage.aspx?subCatId=Uniform-Women&menuItemId=Uniform.5 |archive-date=2010-10-30 |access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>

===Logos===
[[File:Girl Scouts of the USA 1912-1976.svg|thumb|left|Designed by [[Juliette Low]], the sole emblem of the Girl Scouts of the USA from 1912 until 1978]] The emblem designed by [[Juliette Low]] was the only emblem used for Girl Scout pins through 1980. At the 1978 GSUSA National Convention, the use of two logos was voted on, allowing Girl Scouts to pick which they wanted to wear as their Girl Scout pin (for Girl Scout Juniors and up).

The current Girl Scouts of the USA logo is a rejuvenation of the original logo based on [[Saul Bass]]' 1978 design<ref>{{Cite web |last=Armin |date=July 7, 2010 |title=This is not your Mom's Girl Scouts |url=https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/this_is_not_your_moms_girl_scouts.php |access-date=April 13, 2018 |website=Brand New |publisher=Under Consideration}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017 |title=Girl Scout Cookie History |url=https://www.girlscouts.org/en/cookies/all-about-cookies/Cookie-History.html |access-date=April 13, 2018 |website=Girl Scouts of the USA |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref>
, Bass being a graphic designer known for his motion picture title sequences and design of various other well known logos. In 2010, the hair and facial styles were updated by Jennifer Kinon and Bobby C. Martin, Jr. of The Original Champions of Design.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Walker |first=Alissa |date=July 6, 2010 |title=A Fresh Identity for the Girl Scouts of America |url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1661850/a-fresh-identity-for-the-girl-scouts-of-america |access-date=July 6, 2010 |website=Co Design |publisher=Fast Company}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2010 |title=Girl Scouts of the USA: An American Institution |url=http://originalchampionsofdesign.com/girl-scouts-rebrand/ |access-date=April 13, 2018 |website=OCD Agency |publisher=Original Champions of Design}}</ref>

==Activities and programs==
One of the original and continuing attractions of Girl Scouts is that girls become proficient campers and participate in many outdoor activities such as [[canoe]]ing or [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] with their troops. Troops do service projects such as carrying out flag ceremonies, collecting food for food drives, visiting nursing homes, and Christmas caroling or other community services.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What is Girl Scouting? |url=http://www.talusrockpa.org/Girls/girlscouting.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050908113945/http://talusrockpa.org/Girls/girlscouting.asp |archive-date=September 8, 2005 |access-date=November 1, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA, Talus Rock Council}}</ref> Troops may also plan and take extended trips within the United States or even to another country. Troops may organize [[culture|cultural]] or learning events such as first-aid training or attending live theater. The Girl Scout activity most familiar to the general public may be the annual sale of [[Girl Scout Cookies]], which started in 1917 as a money-earning opportunity for councils and troops.

===Girl Scouts and STEM===
In the past few years, Girl Scouts has incorporated [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]]-related programs and badges in order to encourage more interest in Scouts in STEM fields.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Girl Scouts look to build future STEM leaders - May. 25, 2012 |url=https://money.cnn.com/2012/05/24/news/economy/girl-scouts-stem/ |access-date=March 12, 2016 |website=CNNMoney}}</ref> From 2005 to 2007, more than 8.6 million STEM-related badges were sold.<ref>Huband, Frank L.

In June 2017, Girl Scouts announced a partnership with Palo Alto Networks to create 18 cybersecurity badges by September 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-06-15 |title=The Future of Cybersecurity Sells Cookies |url=http://windowsitpro.com/security/future-cybersecurity-sells-cookies |access-date=2017-06-23 |website=windowsitpro.com |language=en}}</ref>

==International Convention==
Every three years Girl Scouts holds an international convention, featuring voting on policies and procedures, as well as guest speakers and activities and events for upwards of 10,000 girls and Girl Scout alums. The next convention will be held in 2020 in Orlando, Florida.

===Destinations===
{{Main|Destinations}}
Once known as "Wider Opportunities" or [[Wider Ops]], [[Destinations]] are travel opportunities for individual older Girl Scouts. Destinations are held within the United States and in other countries. Destinations are primarily international, outdoor, science, people, or apprenticeship oriented,<ref name="toolkit">{{Cite web |title=GSUSA Global Toolkit 'Your Passport to Travel' |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/forgirls/travel//global_travel_toolkit/pdf/destinations_brochure_lores.pdf |access-date=February 26, 2011 |publisher=GSUSA}}</ref> such as [[kayaking]] in Alaska, or career oriented such as learning about working for [[NASA]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Destinations 411 |url=http://www.studio2b.org/escape/destinations/destinations_411.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019001911/http://www.studio2b.org/escape/destinations/destinations_411.asp |archive-date=October 19, 2006 |access-date=November 1, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA |df=mdy}}</ref>

A "Destination" may be a trip to one of the WAGGGS World Centres:

* [[Our Cabaña]] in [[Cuernavaca, Mexico|Cuernavaca]], Mexico
* [[Our Chalet]] in [[Adelboden, Switzerland]]
* [[Pax Lodge]] in London, England
* [[Sangam World Centre]] in [[Pune, India|Pune]], India<ref>{{Cite web |title=Global - Girl Scouts |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/global/wagggs/world_centers.asp |access-date=March 12, 2016 |website=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref>

==Traditions==
The Girl Scouts of the USA have many customs and traditions: camping, community service, singing, and money earning to support their activities. The Girl Scout Handshake and the Girl Scout signal for silence are two shared by WAGGGS member organizations. Other traditions include the Friendship Circle with "the squeeze," taking bandanas and homemade sit-upons on camping trips, and the buddy system.

"Bridging" is the process of going from one level to another. Bridging is usually done at the troop level, although area bridgings are often held. The girls that are bridging walk across a bridge to their new level and are greeted with the Girl Scout Handshake. There is a notable bridging ceremony held in San Francisco, as GS Juniors bridge to GS Cadettes over the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].

[[World Thinking Day]] and "Girl Scouts' Own" are traditions throughout the world of Girl Scouting. World Thinking Day has occurred annually since 1926 on February 22, the birthday of both [[Robert Baden-Powell]] and [[Olave Baden-Powell]]. On World Thinking Day, Girl Scouts and Guides around the world think about their sisters in other lands;<ref name="thinkday">{{Cite web |year=2005 |title=World Thinking Day |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/global/world_thinking_day/world_thinking_day_2005.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221235704/http://www.girlscouts.org/who_we_are/global/world_thinking_day/world_thinking_day_2005.asp |archive-date=February 21, 2007 |access-date=September 25, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref> Councils or local service units (associations) hold a celebration on or near this day, in which each participating troop gives a presentation of the culture and customs of a country selected by the troop. Many Girl Scouts in America celebrate Juliette Gordon Low's birthday on October 31, Founder's Day. The parties often include the girls dressing up in Halloween costumes, and serving birthday cake.

A "Girl Scouts' Own" is a special ceremony that expresses the spirit of Girl Scouting when the girls reflect upon their feelings about Girl Scouting and the world around them. A "Girl Scouts' Own" can have any theme, or none at all. It is a solemn time given for Girl Scouts to create a moment of their very own. It can be held at any time and include the girls' troop or be held at any inter-troop gathering.<ref name="ceremony">{{Cite web |title=CEREMONIES AND CELEBRATIONS |url=http://www.scoutingweb.com/scoutingweb/SubPages/CeremoniesCelebrationsGS.htm |access-date=2016-03-12 |website=Scoutingweb.com}}</ref>

==Badges and other awards==
All levels of Girl Scouts can earn badges. Each level has specific badges that can be earned. Daisies earn badges shaped like flowers. Brownies earn badges shaped like triangles. Juniors earn badges shaped like circles. Cadettes earn badges shaped like diamonds. Seniors earn badges shaped like rectangles. Ambassadors earn badges shaped like squares.

Earned Badges and Awards are worn on the front of a Girl Scout's vest (or sash). Fun Patches are worn on the back of the vest. Daisies wear blue vests. Brownies wear brown vests. Juniors wear green vests. Cadettes, Seniors, and Ambassadors wear khaki vests. For Cadettes, Seniors, and Ambassadors, a Girl Scout may choose wear the same khaki vest for all three levels. Active Girl Scouts, who earn a lot of badges, may opt to get a new khaki vest when they change levels so they have more room to display their awards.

===Journey awards===
Each level of Girl Scouting has multiple Journey programs. A Journey is a series of lessons on a particular topic. The Journeys are made up of multiple parts and all parts of the Journey must be earned for it to be complete. A Girl Scout who completes three Journeys at one level earns a Summit Pin. Before beginning work on a Bronze, Silver, or Gold Award project, a Girl Scout must complete one Journey at her level. A Girl Scout who did not earn her Silver Award must complete two Journeys at her current level, instead of one, to work on her Gold Award.

===Highest awards===
The highest achievement in Girl Scouting is the [[Gold Award (Girl Scouts of the USA)|Girl Scout Gold Award]], which can only be earned by Girl Scout Seniors and Ambassadors. The highest award for Girl Scout Cadettes is the [[Silver Award (Girl Scouts of the USA)|Silver Award]], and [[Bronze Award (Girl Scouts of the USA)|Bronze Award]] is the highest award for Girl Scout Juniors. These awards require large-scale service projects showing leadership along with service hours.<ref>{{Cite web |title=List of Insignia |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/insignia/list/11_17.asp |access-date=November 1, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA}}</ref>

The [[Gold Award (Girl Scouts of the USA)|Girl Scout Gold Award]] is the highest honor a Girl Scout can earn. This award can be earned by Girl Scout Seniors and Girl Scout Ambassadors. This prestigious award represents a Girl Scout's dedication and commitment to Girl Scouting and to her community. Earning the Girl Scout Gold Award requires hard work and a willingness to take on significant responsibility. For many, the leadership and organizational skills and sense of community and commitment that come from earning the Gold Award set the foundation for a lifetime of active citizenship. The Gold Award project takes a minimum of 80 hours to complete.

The [[Silver Award (Girl Scouts of the USA)|Silver Award]], the highest honor a Girl Scout Cadette can earn, gives girls the chance to do big things and make their community better in the process. The Silver Award takes the participants through a seven-step process: identify an issue, build a Girl Scout Silver Award team, explore the community needs, choose a project, develop the project, make a plan, and put it into motion. The Silver Award project takes a minimum of 50 hours to complete.

The [[Bronze Award (Girl Scouts of the USA)|Bronze Award]], the highest honor a Girl Scout Junior can earn, requires girls to learn the leadership and planning skills necessary to follow through on a project that makes a positive impact on her community. Working toward this award demonstrates a Girl Scout's commitment to helping others, improving her community and the world, and becoming the best she can be. The Bronze Award project takes a minimum of 20 hours to complete.

===Adult recognition===
There are also GS awards for adults including: Outstanding Volunteer, Outstanding Leader, Appreciation Pin, Honor Pin, [[Thanks Badge (GSUSA)|Thanks Badge]], and Thanks Badge II. Outstanding Volunteer is awarded for Outstanding service as Girl Scout volunteer (other than a leader). Outstanding Leader is awarded for Outstanding service as Girl Scout leader. Appreciation Pin is awarded for exceptional performance beyond expectations for the position. The Honor Pin recognizes an adult member who has delivered exceptional service beyond expectations to two or more geographic areas, service units or program delivery audiences in a way that furthers the council's goals.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Honor Pin Criteria |url=http://www.tongassgirlscouts.org/Forms/Honor%20Pin%20Award%20Nomination%20Form.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811170049/http://www.tongassgirlscouts.org/Forms/Honor%20Pin%20Award%20Nomination%20Form.pdf |archive-date=August 11, 2006 |access-date=November 2, 2006 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA, Tongass Alaska Girl Scout Council}}</ref> Thanks Badge recognizes outstanding service for a Council as a whole or the Girl Scout Movement as a whole. Different GS councils use different terminology for regions within their council. Thanks Badge II is awarded where the recipient has received the Thanks Badge and the recipient's service continues to merit further recognition. At least one nomination, two endorsements, and a review of the forms is required for each of these awards.<ref>{{Cite web |title=GSUSA Awards |url=http://www.gsnnj.org/adult_recognition2011.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223000047/http://gsnnj.org/adult_recognition2011.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archive-date=December 23, 2010 |access-date=February 2, 2011 |publisher=Girl Scouts of the USA, Girl Scouts of Northern New Jersey}}</ref>

===The American Girl===
From 1917 until 1979 Girl Scouts published a magazine, originally called ''The Rally'' (1917–1920) and then ''The American Girl'', with "The" later dropped (but not to be confused with the currently published ''[[American Girl (magazine)|American Girl]]'' magazine).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Girl Scouting in Indiana&nbsp;— Timeline |url=http://www.in.gov/history/2538.htm |access-date=June 22, 2009 |publisher=Indiana Historical Bureau}}</ref> Circulation exceed 200,000 in the 1940s,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Amar |first=Wesley Francis |year=1943 |title=Children's Magazines Today |journal=The Elementary English Review |volume=20 |issue=7 |page=289 |jstor=41382721}}</ref> and reached as high as 510,000 per month by 1949.<ref>{{Cite book |last=United States.

==Issues==

=== Religion===

====Non-sectarian founding====
When the Girl Scouts were first organized the organization claimed to be "non-sectarian in practice as well as theory". By the early 1920s Catholic Girl Scout units had been founded in New York, Philadelphia, Washington and other cities. In the 1920s about 2,000 Girl Scouts were Catholic.<ref name="preuss" /> From its founding in 1912, it had Jewish leaders and scouts.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Alroy |first=Tal Trachtman |date=30 March 2015 |title=The Jewish History Behind the Girl Scouts |url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/189879/girl-scouts-jewish-history |journal=Tablet Magazine |language=en |access-date=24 December 2018}}</ref>

==== "To serve God" in the Promise====

Since 1993, Girl Scouts have been able to substitute something appropriate to their own beliefs for the phrase "To serve God" in the Girl Scout Promise. This option appears in the guidelines distributed to adult volunteers but not in the actual girls' books. Official volunteer documentation contains this note:<ref name="vol2018">{{Cite book |url=https://www.girlscoutsww.org/content/dam/girlscouts-girlscoutsww/documents/volunteer-essentials.pdf |title=Volunteer Essentials 2018/2019 |date=2018 |publisher=GSUSA |page=24}}</ref>

{{quote|text = Girl Scouts of the USA makes no attempt to define or interpret the word “God” in the Girl Scout Promise. It looks to individual members to establish for themselves the nature of their spiritual beliefs. When making the Girl Scout Promise, individuals may substitute wording appropriate to their own spiritual beliefs for the word "God."}}

This note or a shorter variant also frequently appears on local council web pages.<ref name="utah">{{Cite web |title=Who we are |url=http://www.gsutah.org/en/about-girl-scouts/who-we-are.html |access-date=24 December 2018 |website=Girl Scouts of Utah}}</ref><ref name="GSONC">{{Cite web |title=Who We Are |url=http://www.gscnc.org/en/about-girl-scouts/who-we-are.html |access-date=24 December 2018 |website=Girl Scouts of the National Capital}}</ref>

Volunteers are reminded "to be sensitive to the spiritual beliefs of the girls in your group and to make sure that everyone in the group feels comfortable and included in Girl Scouting" and to feel free to share the policy with the girls' families.<ref name="vol2018" />

The policy change was prompted by attempts to be more inclusive and lawsuits. [[Atheism|Atheist]] parents sued the Boy Scouts of America in 1991 for denying membership in the Cub Scouts to their sons. Considering this news, the Totem Girl Scout Council of Seattle attempted to change the Girl Scout Promise to make mention of "God" optional, which would be more inclusive of local non-theist Native American and Southeast Asian girls. After the national organization asserted this could not be changed locally, the Seattle council advocated that the change be adopted nation-wide.
In November 1992, the parents of Nitzya Cuevas-Macias sued for their daughter to be permitted to participate in the Girl Scouts even though she refused to promise to serve God.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brennan |first=Pat |date=November 19, 1992 |title=OC lawyer moves battle over oath to Girl Scouts&nbsp;— Man who won suit for sons now backing Daisy hopeful |url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/gsusa-problems.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019021525/http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/gsusa-problems.html |archive-date=2016-10-19 |access-date=October 20, 2006 |publisher=BSA Discrimination.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Brennan |first=Pat |date=December 20, 1992 |title=Girl Scout troop ordered to readmit atheist |url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/gsusa-problems.html#921222 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019021525/http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/gsusa-problems.html |archive-date=2016-10-19 |access-date=March 20, 2007 |publisher=BSA Discrimination.org}}</ref>

On October 23, 1993, at the Girl Scouts of the USA annual national convention, delegates voted 1,560 "yes" against 375 "no"<ref>{{Cite news |date=25 Oct 1993 |title=Girl Scouts Allow for Religious Diversity in Pledge |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/25/us/girl-scouts-allow-for-religious-diversity-in-pledge.html}}</ref><ref name="vote">{{Cite web |title=Boy Scouts Of America Practices Discrimination |url=https://ffrf.org/news/timely-topics/item/12599-boy-scouts-of-america-practices-discrimination |access-date=March 2, 2015 |publisher=Freedom From Religion Foundation}}</ref> to permit individuals to substitute another word or phrase for "God" in their promise.<ref name="Nelson" /> The convention gave this explanation:

{{quote|text = For some individuals, the word "God", no matter how broadly interpreted, does not appropriately reflect their spiritual beliefs. Since the belief in a spiritual principle is fundamental to Girl Scouting, not the word used to define that belief, it is important that individuals have the opportunity to express that belief in wording meaningful to them. It is essential to maintain the spiritual foundation of Girl Scouting, yet be inclusive of the full range of spiritual beliefs. This [policy change] does not take the word "God" out of the Girl Scout Promise. It gives those individuals who wish to do so the option to state their commitment to the spiritual concepts fundamental to the Movement with a word or words more appropriate to their own beliefs. For instance, an individual may say "my faith" or "Allah" or "the Creator".<ref>{{Cite web |title=&#91;rec.scouting.issues&#93; Commonly asked questions (FAQ 2)Section - What is the position of the GSUSA as related to God and |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/scouting/rec.scouting.issues/section-25.html}}</ref>}}

Some consider that the Girl Scouts of the USA have not gone far enough in making Scouting open to [[non-theists]]; others that they have gone too far in removing God or that they are violating the constitution of the [[WAGGGS]].

In October 2011, the [[Girl Scouts of Colorado]] council publicly stated, "If a child identifies as a girl and the child's family presents her as a girl, Girl Scouts of Colorado welcomes her as a Girl Scout", when overturning a local troop's rejection of a seven-year-old transgender girl.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 29, 2011 |title=Transgender boy allowed to join Girl Scouts |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/transgender-boy-allowed-to-join-girl-scouts/story-e6freuyi-1226180155319 |access-date=October 29, 2011 |website=The Telegraph |location=Australia}}</ref> In July 2015, the Girl Scouts of Western Washington returned a $100,000 donation after the donor stipulated that the money could not be used to support services for transgender Scouts.

===Local objections to sex education sponsored by Planned Parenthood in Waco, Texas===
GSUSA is not aligned with and does not endorse, at the national level, the reproductive health organization [[Planned Parenthood]]; Girl Scout councils may choose to have or not have connections with Planned Parenthood.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kleder |first=Martha |date=March 30, 2004 |title=Girl Scouts' Stumble Boosts Christian-Based American Heritage Girls |url=http://www.cwfa.org/articles/5431/CWA/misc/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103005050/http://www.cwfa.org/articles/5431/CWA/misc/index.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=November 3, 2006 |access-date=November 4, 2006}}</ref> In 2003, in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], Texas, the local Bluebonnet Council was listed as a co-sponsor, with the Girl Scouts logo printed on the promotional flyer, of the Planned Parenthood of Central Texas event titled "Nobody's Fool '03: Dating, Love, Sex & HIV."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Honest Girl Scouts |url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/HonestGirlScout/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1600373513319974}}</ref> In 2004, the same Council promoted a Planned Parenthood education event without providing money nor sending Girl Scouts to it.
