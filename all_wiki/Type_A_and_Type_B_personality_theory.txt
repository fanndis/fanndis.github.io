{{short description|Hypothesized duality of personality types}}
{{Distinguish|Cluster A personality disorder|Cluster B personality disorder}}

'''Type A and Type B personality hypothesis''' describes two contrasting [[personality type]]s. In this hypothesis, personalities that are more competitive, highly organized, ambitious, impatient, highly aware of time management or aggressive are labeled Type A, while more relaxed, less "neurotic", "frantic", "explainable" personalities are labeled Type B.

The two cardiologists who developed this theory came to believe that Type A personalities had a greater chance of developing [[coronary artery disease|coronary heart disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.4.783 |title=Personality, Type a behavior, and coronary heart disease: The role of emotional expression |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=783–792 |year=1987 |last1=Friedman |first1=Howard S. |last2=Booth-Kewley |first2=Stephanie |pmid=3681651 |s2cid=25769007 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6facf711ecd374ac414ca2953d0aa2d6f94f17a9 }}</ref> Following the results of further studies and considerable controversy about the role of the [[tobacco industry]] funding of early research in this area, some reject, either partially or completely, the link between Type A personality and coronary disease.

== History ==
Type A personality behavior was first described as a potential risk factor for [[coronary heart disease|heart disease]] in the 1950s by [[cardiology|cardiologists]] [[Meyer Friedman]] and [[Ray Rosenman]]. They credit their insight to an upholsterer who called to their attention the peculiar fact that the chairs in their waiting rooms were only worn out on the front edge of the seat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul|title=Type A personality|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/personality-a.html|website=Simply Psychology|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> After an eight-and-a-half-year-long study of healthy men between the ages of 35 and 59, Friedman and Rosenman estimated that Type A behavior more than doubled the risk of [[coronary heart disease]] in otherwise healthy individuals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=M.|author2=Rosenman, R. |title=Association of specific overt behaviour pattern with blood and cardiovascular findings|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|year=1959|volume=169|issue=12|pages=1286–1296|doi=10.1001/jama.1959.03000290012005|pmid=13630753}}</ref> The individuals enrolled in this study were followed well beyond the original time frame of the study. Participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire, that asked questions like "Do you feel guilty if you use spare time to relax?" and "Do you generally move, walk, and eat rapidly?"<ref name="Type A Personality">{{cite web|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul|title=Type A Personality|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/personality-a.html|website=Simply Psychology|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> Subsequent analysis indicated that although Type A personality is associated with the incidence of coronary heart disease, it does not seem to be a risk factor for mortality.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ragland|first=D.|author2=Brand, R. |title=Type A Behavior and Mortality from Coronary Heart Disease|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|year=1988|volume=388|issue=2|pages=65–69|doi=10.1056/nejm198801143180201|pmid=3336396}}</ref> It was originally called 'Type A Personality' by Friedman and Roseman, it has now been conceptualized as the Type A behavior pattern. <ref>https://www.simplypsychology.org/personality-a.html</ref>

== The types ==
=== Type A ===
The hypothesis describes Type A individuals as outgoing, ambitious, rigidly organized, highly [[Social status|status]]-conscious, impatient, anxious, proactive, and concerned with [[time management]]. People with Type A personalities are often high-achieving "[[workaholic]]s". They push themselves with deadlines, and hate both delays and ambivalence.<ref>{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=Type A Personality|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/personality-a.html|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> People with Type A personalities experience more job-related stress and less job satisfaction.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(02)00018-1 |title=The influence of type a behaviour and locus of control upon job satisfaction and occupational health |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=1361–1371 |year=2002 |last1=Kirkcaldy |first1=Bruce D. |last2=Shephard |first2=Roy J. |last3=Furnham |first3=Adrian F. }}</ref> Interestingly, those with Type A personalities do not always outperform those with Type B personalities.

"Examining Type A Behavior Pattern to Explain the Relationship Between Job Stressors and Psychosocial Outcomes"</ref>

In his 1996 book dealing with extreme Type A behavior, ''Type A Behavior: Its Diagnosis and Treatment'', [[Meyer Friedman|Friedman]] suggests that dangerous Type A behavior is expressed through three major symptoms: (1) free-floating hostility, which can be triggered by even minor incidents; (2) time urgency and impatience, which causes [[irritation]] and [[exasperation]] usually described as being "short-fused"; and (3) a [[competitive]] [[drive theory|drive]], which causes [[stress (biology)|stress]] and an achievement-driven mentality. The first of these symptoms is believed to be covert and therefore less observable, while the other two are more overt.<ref>Friedman, M. (1996). ''Type A Behavior: Its Diagnosis and Treatment''. New York, Plenum Press (Kluwer Academic Press), pp. 31 ff.</ref>

Type A people were said to be hasty, impatient, impulsive, hyperalert, potentially hostile, and angry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=T.

Janet Spence's research has shown that the Type A archetype can be broken down into two factors: Achievement Striving (AS) and Impatience Irritability (II), assessed using a modified Jenkins activity survey (with 7 questions assessing AS and 5 items assessing II). AS is a desirable factor which is characterized by being hard working, active, and taking work seriously. II is undesirable and is characterized by impatience, irritability, and anger.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.72.4.522 |title=Impatience versus achievement strivings in the Type a pattern: Differential effects on students' health and academic achievement |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=522–528 |year=1987 |last1=Spence |first1=Janet T. |last2=Helmreich |first2=Robert L. |last3=Pred |first3=Robert S. |pmid=3680097 |hdl=2060/19870017967 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> Subsequent work by Day and Jreige has further clarified the independence of these two subtypes of type A personality. Additionally they further defined the interactions between AS and II subtypes and psychosocial outcomes.  AS was more strongly linked to job satisfaction while II was linked to self report of satisfaction and life satisfaction.  Associations were demonstrated between AS and II subtypes moderating the impact of job stressors (job control, role overload and role ambiguity) on outcomes of job satisfaction, life satisfaction and perceived stress.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Day|first1=Arla L.|last2=Jreige|first2=Steve|date=2002|title=Examining Type A behavior pattern to explain the relationship between job stressors and psychosocial outcomes.|journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|volume=7|issue=2|pages=109–120|doi=10.1037/1076-8998.7.2.109|issn=1076-8998}}</ref>

There are two main methods to assessing Type A behavior. The first being the SI and the second being the [[Jenkins activity survey|Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS)]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Howard, S.|last2=Booth-Kewley|first2=Stephanie|title=Personality, type a behaviour, and coronary heart disease: the role of emotional expression|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 October 1987|volume=53|issue=4|pages=783–792|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.4.783|pmid=3681651|s2cid=25769007|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6facf711ecd374ac414ca2953d0aa2d6f94f17a9}}</ref> The SI assessment involves an interviewer measuring a person's emotional, nonverbal and verbal responses (your expressive style). The JAS involves a self questionnaire with three main categories: Speed and Impatience, Job Involvement, and Hard-Driving Competitiveness.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Howard, S.|last2=Booth-Kewley|first2=Stephanie|title=Personality, type a behavior, and coronary heart disease: the role of emotional expression|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 October 1987|volume=53|issue=4|pages=783–792|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.4.783|pmid=3681651|s2cid=25769007|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6facf711ecd374ac414ca2953d0aa2d6f94f17a9}}</ref>

=== Type B ===
Type B is a behavior pattern that is lacking in Type A behaviors. A-B personality is a continuum where one either leans to be more Type A or Non Type A (Type B).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fretwell |first1=Cherie E |last2=Lewis |first2=Carmen C |last3=Hannay |first3=Maureen |title=Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, A/B Personality Types, and Locus of Control: Where Do They Intersect? |journal=American Journal of Management |date=2013 |volume=13 |issue=3 |page=57–66 |url=http://www.na-businesspress.com/AJM/FretwellCE_Web13_3_.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref>

The hypothesis describes Type B individuals as a contrast to those of Type A. Type B personality, by definition, are noted to live at lower stress levels. They typically work steadily, and may enjoy achievement, although they have a greater tendency to disregard physical or mental stress when they do not achieve. When faced with competition, they may focus less on winning or losing than their Type A counterparts, and more on enjoying the game regardless of winning or losing. Unlike the Type A personality's rhythm of multi-tasked careers, Type B individuals are sometimes attracted to careers of creativity: writer, counselor, therapist, actor or actress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Their personal character may enjoy exploring ideas and concepts.

Type B personality types are more tolerant than individuals in the Type A category.<ref name="Type A Personality"/> This can be evident through their relationship style that members of upper management prefer. Type B individuals can "...see things from a global perspective, encourage teamwork, and exercise patience in decision making..."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=W.E. |last2=Minzenmayer |first2=T. |last3=Bowler |first3=M. |title=Type A personality characteristics and the effect on individual and team academic performance |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |date=2006 |volume=36 |issue=5 |page=1110–1128 |doi=10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00033.x }}</ref>

=== Interactions between Type A and Type B ===
Type A individuals' proclivity for competition and aggression is illustrated in their interactions with other Type As and with Type Bs. When playing a modified [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] game, Type A individuals elicited more competitiveness and angry feelings from both Type A and Type B opponents than did the Type B individuals. Type A individuals punished their Type A counterparts more than their Type B counterparts, and more than Type Bs punished other Type Bs. Rivalry between Type A individuals was shown by more aggressive behavior in their interactions, including initial antisocial responses, refusal to cooperate, verbal threats, and behavioral challenges.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Karen|date=1982|title=Psychological Perspectives on the Type A Behavior Pattern|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=91|issue=2|pages=302|pmid=7071263|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.91.2.293}}</ref>

=== Funding by tobacco companies ===
Further discrediting the so-called Type A Behavior Pattern (TABP), a study from 2012 – based on searching the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library – suggests the phenomenon of initially promising results followed by negative findings to be partly explained by the tobacco industry's involvement in TABP research to undermine the scientific evidence on smoking and health. The industry's interest in TABP lasted at least four decades until the late 1990s, involving substantial funding to key researchers encouraged to prove smoking to simply correlate with a personality type prone to coronary heart disease (CHD) and cancer.<ref name="Petticrew et al., 2012">{{cite journal|last=Petticrew|first=M.

Moreover, Philip Morris primarily funded the Meyer Friedman Institute, e.g. conducting the "crown-jewel" trial on the effectiveness of reducing TABP whose expected findings could discredit studies associating smoking with CHD and cancer but failing to control for Type A behavior.<ref name="Petticrew et al., 2012" />

In 1994, Friedman wrote to the US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] criticising restrictions on indoor smoking to reduce CHD, claiming the evidence remained unreliable since it did not account for the significant confounder of Type A behavior, notwithstanding the fact that by then, TABP had proven to be significant in only three of twelve studies. Though apparently unpaid for, this letter was approved by and blind-copied to Philip Morris, and Friedman (falsely) claimed to receive funding largely from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.<ref name="Friedman, 1994">{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Meyer|title=Letter to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/doe42d00|work=Legacy Tobacco Documents Library|accessdate=13 November 2013}}</ref>

Some scholars argue that Type A behavior is not a good predictor of [[coronary heart disease]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web| url=http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0607/Sept05_06/03.shtml | title=Bates, K.

''Handbook of Health Psychology''. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.</ref> Thus, it is a high level of expressed anger and hostility, not the other elements of Type A behavior, that constitutes the problem.

The initial study that pointed to the association of Type A personality and heart attacks had a massive number of questions under consideration. When there are a lot of questions there is a high probability of a false positive. A study undertaken by the U.S. National Institute of Aging, Sardinian and Italian researchers, as well as bio-statisticians from the University of Michigan, had specifically tested for a direct relation between coronary heart disease and Type A personalities, and the results had indicated that no such relation exists.<ref name=":0" /> A simple explanation{{weasel inline|date=March 2018}} is that the initial finding was chance due to multiple questions being under consideration. Those considerations may have changed.

The effects were not as dramatic as behavior therapy, but still showed improvement in preventing death among cancer and CHD patients.

From the study above, several conclusions have been made. A relationship between personality and cancer exists, along with a relationship between personality and coronary heart disease. Personality type acts as a risk factor for diseases and interacts synergistically with other risk factors, such as smoking and heredity. It has been statistically proven that behavior therapy can significantly reduce the likelihood of cancer or coronary heart disease mortality.<ref>{{Citation|last=Stoll|first=Basil A.|chapter=Does the Mind Affect Cancer Risk?|date=1989|pages=103–114|publisher=Macmillan Education UK|isbn=9781349107100|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-10708-7_10|title=Social Dilemmas in Cancer Prevention}}</ref> Studies suggest that both body and mental disease arise from each other.

A study conducted by the ''International Journal of Behavioral Medicine'' re-examined the association between the Type A concept with cardiovascular (CVD) and non-cardiovascular (non-CVD) mortality by using a long follow-up (on average 20.6 years) of a large population-based sample of elderly males (N = 2,682), by applying multiple Type A measures at baseline, and looking separately at early and later follow-up years. The study sample were the participants of the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, (KIHD), which includes a randomly selected representative sample of Eastern Finnish men, aged 42–60 years at baseline in the 1980s. They were followed up until the end of 2011 through linkage with the National Death Registry. Four self-administered scales, Bortner Short Rating Scale, Framingham Type A Behavior Pattern Scale, Jenkins Activity Survey, and Finnish Type A Scale, were used for Type A assessment at the start of follow-up. Type A measures were inconsistently associated with cardiovascular mortality, and most associations were non-significant. Some scales suggested slightly decreased, rather than increased, risk of CVD death during the follow-up. Associations with non-cardiovascular deaths were even weaker. The study's findings further suggest that there is no evidence to support the Type A as a risk factor for CVD and non-CVD mortality.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=25169700 | doi=10.1007/s12529-014-9435-1 | volume=22 | issue=2 | title=Type A behavior pattern is not a predictor of premature mortality | year=2015 | journal=Int J Behav Med | pages=161–9 |vauthors=Šmigelskas K, Žemaitienė N, Julkunen J, Kauhanen J | s2cid=29235179 }}</ref>

Maintaining healthy [[magnesium]] (Mg) levels in the body plays a strong role in protecting the cardiovascular health of an individual. An analysis of the literature suggests the possible role of Mg deficiency in the susceptibility to [[cardiovascular disease]]s, observed among subjects displaying a Type A behavior pattern. Type A subjects are more sensitive to stress and produce more catecholamines than Type B subjects. This, in turn, seems to induce an intracellular Mg loss. In the long run, type A individuals would develop a state of Mg deficiency, which may promote a greater sensitivity to stress and, ultimately, lead to the development of cardiovascular problems.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Type A behavior and magnesium metabolism|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=3523058 | volume=5|issue=3–4 |journal=Magnesium|pages=201–10 | author = Henrotte JG}}</ref>

=== Substance abuse ===
In a 1998 study done by Ball et al., they looked at differences in Type A and Type B personalities based on substance use. Their results showed that Type B personalities had more severe issues with substance abuse than Type A personalities.<ref name="Samuel, A 1998">{{cite journal|last1=Ball|first1=Samuel, A.|last2=Kranzler|first2=Henry, R.|last3=Tennen|first3=Howard|last4=Poling|first4=James, C.|last5=Rounsaville|first5=Bruce, J.|title=Personality disorder and dimension differences between type a and type b substance abusers|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|date=1998|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1521/pedi.1998.12.1.1|pmid=9573515}}</ref> Another discovery in their research was more Type B personalities had been diagnosed with a personality disorder than users who had Type A personalities.<ref name="Samuel, A 1998"/> Type B personalities were rated higher than Type A personalities on symptoms of all [[DSM-IV]] personality disorders, with the exception of [[schizoid personality disorder]].<ref name="Samuel, A 1998"/>

The research conducted in the experiment was tested on 370 outpatients and inpatients of alcohol, cocaine, and opiate substance abusers. The personality types and distinctions were replicated.<ref name="Samuel, A 1998"/> Additionally within the personality dimensions Type A and Type B exhibited different results. Type A personality portrayed higher levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, cooperativeness, and self-directedness. In contrast, Type B personality showed higher levels of neuroticism, novelty seeking, and harm avoidance.<ref name="Samuel, A 1998"/> These dimensions can have high correlational levels with mental illness or substance abuse. Furthermore, even after antisocial personality and psychiatric symptoms, these effects remained.<ref name="Samuel, A 1998"/>.
