'''Ban Bossy''' is a [[self-censorship]] campaign launched in 2014 by [[LeanIn.org]]. The campaign criticizes the use of the word "[[wikt:bossy#Adjective|bossy]]" to describe assertive girls and women, proposing that the word is stigmatizing and may discourage girls and women from seeking positions of leadership.<ref name="Time1">{{cite magazine |title=Dad: I'm Going to Keep Calling My Daughter Bossy |url=http://time.com/27200/dad-why-im-going-to-keep-calling-my-daughter-bossy/|magazine=Time |accessdate=20 March 2014|date=17 March 2014}}</ref>

== Promotion ==

The campaign website also features training material designed for schools, teachers, parents and children to further the project.

== Criticism ==
The campaign has received criticism since its launch. [[Joan Rivers]] commented that she found the online movement to be "so stupid" and added, "I find it outrageous and I find it petty ... and I find we're so damn uptight in this country that this whole country is being divided."<ref name="SiriusXM1">{{cite web|title='It's so stupid'– Joan Rivers isn't a fan of 'ban bossy'|url=http://blog.siriusxm.com/2014/03/25/its-so-stupid-joan-rivers-isnt-a-fan-of-ban-bossy/|publisher=[[SiriusXM]]|accessdate=11 April 2014|date=25 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022624/http://blog.siriusxm.com/2014/03/25/its-so-stupid-joan-rivers-isnt-a-fan-of-ban-bossy/|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Phil Mason]] has drawn parallels between the banning of words and [[authoritarianism]], observing that telling people what words they can or cannot use is inherently bossy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thunderf00t |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVKyesBzDAs |title=Epic Feminist Fails of our time: 'Ban Bossy' |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-03-29 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>

In ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Margaret Talbot]] criticized the campaign itself as bossy and instead suggested reclaiming the word, much as has been done for "nerd" and "queer".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/dont-ban-bossy|title=Don’t Ban "Bossy"|last=Talbot|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Talbot|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=13 March 2014|accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref> 
''[[Media Research Center#NewsBusters|NewsBusters]]'' blogger Katie Yoder described Beyoncé's support of the campaign as hypocritical, in light of how the word "bitch" is spoken nine times on the singer's [[Beyoncé (album)|self-titled album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsbusters.org/blogs/katie-yoder/2014/03/18/ban-bossy-beyonc-says-b-9x-new-album|title=Ban 'Bossy?'
