The PDB is produced by the [[United States Director of National Intelligence|director of national intelligence]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36532-2005Feb18.html |title=CIA to Cede President's Brief to Negroponte |last=Pincus |first=Walter |date=February 19, 2005 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=August 29, 2019}}</ref> and involves fusing intelligence from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] and other members of the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]].

==Purpose and history==
The PDB is intended to provide the president with new [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] warranting attention and analysis of sensitive international situations. The prototype of the PDB was termed the President's Intelligence Check List (PICL);<ref name=CIA2014Evol/> the first was produced by CIA officer [[Richard Lehman (CIA officer)|Richard Lehman]] at the direction of [[Huntington D. Sheldon]] on June 17, 1961 for [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/presidents-daily-brief-1961-1969 |title=The Collection of Presidential Briefing Products from 1961 to 1969 |website=CIA Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Electronic Reading Room |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0005958911.pdf |title=The President's Intelligence Checklist 17 June 1961 |date=June 17, 1961 |website=CIA Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Electronic Reading Room |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}</ref>

Although the production and coordination of the PDB was a CIA responsibility, other members of the U.S. intelligence community reviewed articles (the "coordination" process) and were free to write and submit articles for inclusion.<ref name="KennedyJohnson">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/intelligence-history/presidents-daily-brief/PDB_Kennedy_and_Johnson_public16Sep2015.pdf |title=The President's Daily Brief: Delivering Intelligence to Kennedy and Johnson |first=Celia |last=Mansfield |date=September 16, 2015 |website=CIA Historical Collections |accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref>

While the name of the PDB implies exclusivity, it has historically been briefed to other high officials. The distribution list has varied over time but has always or almost always included the [[Vice-President of the United States|Vice-President]], [[United States Secretary of State|secretaries of state]] and [[United States Secretary of Defense|defense]] and the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|national security advisor]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Rarely, special editions of the PDB have actually been "for the president's eyes only," with further dissemination of the information left to the president's discretion.<ref name="KennedyJohnson" />

Production of the PDB is associated with that of another publication, historically known as the '''National Intelligence Daily''', that includes many of the same items but is distributed considerably more widely than the PDB.

==Political importance==
Former CIA director [[George Tenet]] considered the PDB so sensitive that during July 2000 he indicated to the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] that none of them could be released for publication "no matter how old or historically significant it may be."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A2130-2002May23 |title=Under Bush, the Briefing Gets Briefer |last=Pincus |first=Walter |date=May 24, 2002 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=September 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824111836/https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A2130-2002May23 |archive-date=August 24, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During a briefing on May 21, 2002, [[Ari Fleischer]], former [[White House Press Secretary]], characterized the PDB as "the most highly sensitized classified document in the [[Federal government of the United States|government]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/05/20020521-9.html |title=Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer |date=May 21, 2002 |website=[[White House]] |access-date=August 29, 2019}}</ref>

On September 16, 2015, CIA director [[John O. Brennan|John Brennan]] spoke at the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|LBJ Presidential Library]], at the public release of a total of 2,500 daily briefs and intelligence checklists from the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]] and [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon B.

==Public awareness==
The PDB was scrutinized by news media during [[testimony]] to the [[9/11 Commission]], which was convened during 2004 to analyze the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].  On April 8, 2004, after a testimony by then-National Security Advisor [[Condoleezza Rice]], the commission renewed calls for the [[declassification]] of a PDB from August 6, 2001, entitled ''[[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US]]''.  Two days later, the White House complied and released the document with [[redaction]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB116/ |title=The President's Daily Brief |last=Blanton |first=Thomas S. |date=April 12, 2004 |website=[[National Security Archive]] |access-date=January 12, 2017}}</ref>

==Usage by presidents and presidents-elect==
During the 2012 re-election campaign, a former [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] official and President [[Barack Obama]] critic reported that "officials tell me the former president [Bush] held his intelligence meeting six days a week, no exceptions" (for a putative 86% in-person attendance record) though "Bush records [were] not yet available electronically for analysis". Obama records, by contrast in this analysis, showed that during "his first 1,225 days in office, Obama attended his PDB just 536 times — or 43.8 percent of the time. During 2011 and the first half of 2012 [within the 1,225 days analyzed], his attendance ... [fell] to just over 38 percent."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-is-obama-skipping-more-than-half-of-his-daily-intelligence-meetings/2012/09/10/6624afe8-fb49-11e1-b153-218509a954e1_story.html |title=Opinions: ...

In the first six weeks of the [[presidential transition of Donald Trump]] in 2016, the president-elect averaged about one PDB a week. He had "participated in multiple PDBs in some weeks, CNN has learned. And the transition team said last week Trump would be increasing his PDB participation to three times a week."<ref name=CNN01>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/21/politics/trump-intel-briefings-flynn-meeting/ |title=Trump to receive intel briefing, meet Flynn |last1=Wright |first1=David |last2=Starr |first2=Barbara |date=December 21, 2016 |website=[[CNN]] |access-date=January 12, 2017}}</ref>  In mid-December 2016, the CIA website said Obama had initiated electronic delivery of the written brief in 2014 and that he received it six days a week.<ref name=CIA2014Evol>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2014-featured-story-archive/the-evolution-of-the-presidents-daily-brief.html |title=The Evolution of the President's Daily Brief |date=July 10, 2014 |website=CIA |access-date=January 12, 2017}}</ref>
