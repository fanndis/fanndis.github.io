The '''University of Hull''' is a [[public research university]] in [[Kingston upon Hull]], a city in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England. It was founded in 1927 as '''University College Hull'''. The main university campus is located in Hull and is home to the [[Hull York Medical School]], a joint initiative with the [[University of York]]. Students are served by [[Hull University Union]].

The first chancellor of the university was [[Michael Willoughby, 11th Baron Middleton|Lord Middleton]] (1954–1969), followed by [[Henry Cohen, 1st Baron Cohen of Birkenhead|Lord Cohen]] (1970–1977), [[Richard Wilberforce, Baron Wilberforce|Lord Wilberforce]] (1978–1994), and [[Robert Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Ilminster|Lord Armstrong]] (1994–2006). [[Virginia Bottomley]] (Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone) was installed as the current chancellor in April 2006.

==History==

===University College===

[[File:"Moving Matter" by Joseph Hillier - geograph.org.uk - 745357.jpg|thumb|‘Moving Matter’ by Joseph Hillier]]

The foundation stone of '''University College Hull''', then an external college of the [[University of London]], was laid in 1927 by Prince Albert, the [[Duke of York]] (who later became king as [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]]).<ref>Bamford, plate facing p. 23</ref> The college was built on land donated by [[Hull City Council]] and by two local benefactors, [[Thomas Ferens]] and G F Grant. A year later the first 14 departments, in pure sciences and the arts, opened with 39 students. The college at that time consisted of one building, now named the Venn building (after the mathematician [[John Venn]], who was born in Hull). The building now houses the administrative centre of the university. Other early buildings include the Cohen Building, which originally housed the college library, and Staff House, now named Canham Turner building, built in 1948 as the Students' Union. Another early structure was the Chemistry Building, built in 1953. With the rapid expansion of student numbers which took place in the 1950s many many academic departments were housed in temporary buildings, colloquially known as 'huts', which gave the campus the feel of an 'academic army camp'.<ref name="www2.hull.ac.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www2.hull.ac.uk/administration/staffinduction/aboutus/thehistoryofourbuildings.aspx |title=The history of our buildings – University of Hull |publisher=University of Hull |accessdate=15 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201215434/http://www2.hull.ac.uk/administration/staffinduction/aboutus/thehistoryofourbuildings.aspx |archivedate=1 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Bamford, pp, 222–234</ref>

Though many of the older buildings on Hull's campus are of [[red brick]] it is not a ''[[redbrick university]]'' in the strictest sense of the term, as it was not founded as part of the civic university movement of the late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] eras.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/into-university/az-uni-colleges/hull-university-of-458957.html |title=The Independent newspaper, A-Z of universities, 3rd para |work=The Independent |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |location=London}}</ref> Hull, with its origins in the 1920s, has been categorised as a 'younger civic university' (also referred to as a "Whitetile university") and it is placed between the 'redbricks' and the 'plateglass universities' founded in the 1960s.<ref>Beloff, Michael (1970) ''The Plateglass Universities'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, p. 19.</ref>

The first principal of the college was [[Arthur Eustace Morgan|Arthur E. Morgan]] (1926–1935), the second was [[John H Nicholson]] (1935–1954), who also served as the university's first vice-chancellor when the college was granted university status (1954–1956).<ref>Bamford, pp. 23–27, 68–69</ref>

====Coat of arms====
The university coat of arms was designed by Sir Algernon Tudor-Craig in 1928. The symbols are the torch for learning, the rose for Yorkshire, the ducal coronet from the arms of the City of Hull, the fleur-de-lys for Lincolnshire and the dove, symbolising peace, from the arms of Thomas Ferens. These symbols were later reused to create the current university logo. The motto, ''Lampada Ferens'' (Bearing the Torch), incorporates the name of the university's founding father within a Latin pun.<ref name="Hullalumni.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.hullalumni.org/info/themace.cfm |title="The Mace – a potent symbol of authority", University of Hull Alumni Site |publisher=Hullalumni.org |accessdate=28 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206053859/http://www.hullalumni.org/info/themace.cfm |archivedate=6 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Bamford, p. 47</ref>

===Royal charter===
The college gained its [[royal charter]] on 6 September 1954. This empowered it to award degrees of its own, making it the 3rd university in Yorkshire and the 14th in England. The twenty six years between the formation of the university college and the awarding of the charter were the shortest such period in the history of university formation in England up to that time.<ref>Bamford, pp. 150–151</ref> Within a year of the charter being granted applications to study at the new university had doubled, and in 1956 student numbers topped 1,000 for the first time.

===The mace===
The academic authority and autonomy of the university is symbolically embodied in the ceremonial mace. Made of gilt silver, and incorporating devices from the Hull University coat of arms, the mace was presented to the university in December 1956 by the Lord Mayor of Hull. As a gift from the city it also reflects the close relationship between "town and gown" existing in Hull. The mace is carried in procession and displayed at all major university ceremonies.<ref name="Hullalumni.org"/>

===Expansion in the 1950s and 1960s===
[[File:Brynmor Jones Library -Hull -2003.JPG|thumb|Brynmor Jones Library]]
The period of rapid expansion of Hull University coincided with the vice-chancellorship of Sir [[Brynmor Jones (academic)|Brynmor Jones]] (1956–1972), during whose time in office student numbers quadrupled.

The [[Brynmor Jones Library]], which houses more than a million volumes, was constructed in two phases: the first phase was fully completed in 1959, with a tower block extension officially opened in 1970. During the 1950s and 1960s a considerable number of academic buildings were built, including the Larkin and Wilberforce Buildings (originally given other names). The 'Martin Plan' of 1967, Sir [[Leslie Martin]] was the university architect, envisaged a campus with its tallest buildings in the centre surrounded by buildings diminishing in height towards the perimeter. In the course of the 1960s most of the departments housed in temporary structures were moved into new purpose-built premises.<ref>Bamford, pp, 222–246</ref> However, Biochemistry was still partially located in a 'hut' to the rear of the Venn building into the early 1980s.<ref name="www2.hull.ac.uk"/> This early phase of expansion through building ended in 1974, after this year there was to be no further academic building construction on the campus until 1996. However, student numbers doubled in this period, with the university becoming highly efficient in using its existing building stock.<ref name="History: University of Hull Website">{{cite web |url=http://www2.hull.ac.uk/theuniversity/history.aspx |title=History – University of Hull |publisher=University of Hull |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=15 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107013059/http://www2.hull.ac.uk/theuniversity/history.aspx |archivedate=7 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Liquid crystal technology===
In 1972 [[George William Gray|George Gray]] and Ken Harrison created room-temperature stable [[liquid crystal]]s in the university chemistry laboratories, which were an immediate success in the electronics industry and consumer products. This led to Hull becoming the first university to be awarded the [[Queen's Award for Technological Achievement]] for the joint-development of the long-lasting materials that made [[liquid crystal display]]s possible.<ref name="History: University of Hull Website"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hull.ac.uk/chemistry/research/LCgroup/history.htm |title=You are being redirected |publisher=University of Hull |accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref>

===Expansion in the 21st century===
In 2000 the university bought the site of [[University College Scarborough]] on Filey Road, [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], plus two linked buildings on the same road. This became the University of Hull Scarborough Campus.

A further significant expansion took place in 2003, when the buildings of the former [[Humberside University]] campus, which were situated immediately adjacent to Hull University's main campus, were purchased. The acquisition increased the size of the Cottingham Road campus by more than a third. It was the largest single act of expansion in the history of the university. Hull University fully occupied the newly acquired premises in the 2005 academic year; the area becoming the university's West Campus. The site now houses the [[Hull York Medical School]] and the relocated business school, which is located in three of the most prominent buildings – Wharfe, Derwent and Esk.<ref name="History: University of Hull Website"/>

In 2012, the University began the ambitious refurbishment of the Brynmor Jones Library, a £28&nbsp;million project which will transform the 7 storey former workplace of Philip Larkin, into a learning hub suitable for students for years to come. The project was completed in 2015.<ref name="History: University of Hull Website"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-34262641|title=Poet laureate opens £28m library|date=16 September 2015|accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>

===Hull History Centre===
The [[Hull History Centre]], which opened in 2010, is located in a new building on Worship Street in Hull city centre. It unites the holdings of Hull City Library's Local Studies collections and Hull University's archives and is run in partnership between the City Library and University Library.

===City of Culture 2017===
[[File:University of Hull graduates and Blade.jpg|thumb|Graduates from a ceremony at the University of Hull gather outside [[Hull City Hall]] under the installation Blade, part of the [[Hull UK City of Culture 2017]] celebrations]]
The University was a principal partner of the City's bid to become [[UK City of Culture]] in 2017. As well as being involved in the planning and preparation of the bid, the University and its staff and students have been involved in many of the events of the year. For example, during the initial three-month season, [[Hull Maritime Museum]] displayed a multimedia installation depicting a [[Bowhead whale]]<ref>{{Cite web| title = Bowhead| work = Hull UK City of Culture 2017| accessdate = 18 January 2017| url = https://www.hull2017.co.uk/whatson/events/bowhead/}}</ref> The installation was designed by students from [[Hull School of Art|Hull School of Art and Design]] with music by students from Hull University.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Young| first = Angus| title = Family of whales brought to life for amazing City of Culture show| work = Hull Daily Mail| accessdate = 18 January 2017| date = 5 January 2017| url = http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/bowhead-at-hull-maritime-museum-brings-family-of-whales-to-life-for-stunning-city-of-culture/story-30024964-detail/story.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170118214712/http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/bowhead-at-hull-maritime-museum-brings-family-of-whales-to-life-for-stunning-city-of-culture/story-30024964-detail/story.html| archivedate = 18 January 2017| url-status = dead }}</ref> The opening event of the whole year, from 1–7 January, included a multimedia projection called ''Arrivals and Departures'' which was greatly influenced by the work of Dr Nick Evans on migration patterns into and through Hull. The installation was projected onto [[The Deep (aquarium)|The Deep]] using stop-frame animation, image and sound.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Made in Hull: migrant research transformed into visual journey – University of Hull| accessdate = 20 January 2017| url = http://www2.hull.ac.uk/news-and-events-1/news-archive/2017newsarchive/january/made-in-hull.aspx#.WH-LlpGjDdI.twitter| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170202005257/http://www2.hull.ac.uk/news-and-events-1/news-archive/2017newsarchive/january/made-in-hull.aspx#.WH-LlpGjDdI.twitter| archivedate = 2 February 2017| url-status = dead }}</ref>

==Campuses==

The main campus is located in a residential district of North Hull on [[Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire|Cottingham]] Road. The University had a smaller campus in Scarborough on the North Yorkshire coast.

Hull University is a campus university; though situated in a city, its main campus is in a suburban rather than urban district. The main campus occupies a single, clearly defined site and is self-contained in regard to catering and entertainment for students and staff. Most of the major features of the campus are described in the 'history' section above; in addition, the campus has a large Students' Union building, which is often described as one of the finest in the country, and extensive playing fields and other sports facilities. The large village of [[Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire|Cottingham]] on Hull's north-western outskirts houses some of the university-owned student accommodation.

===University College Scarborough===
'''University of Hull: Scarborough Campus''' was a [[satellite campus]] of the university located in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[North Yorkshire]], attended by approximately 2,000 students. Formerly a higher education institution offering BSc and [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degrees, the building was acquired by the University of Hull in 2000, offering Education courses, particularly at a [[primary school|primary level]], as well as courses in [[Marine Biology]], [[Digital Media]], [[Music Technology]] [[Theatre Studies]], [[Hospitality management studies|Tourism Management]], and a number of [[Business studies|Business]] and [[English studies|English]] courses.

Scarborough ran somewhat independently of the main campus in [[Kingston-upon-Hull|Hull]], with its own branch of the [[Hull University Union]]. Graduation ceremonies took place within Scarborough's historic [[The Spa, Scarborough|Spa Complex]]. The campus also contained basic amenities for study, such as [[computer lab]]s, performance studios for students of Theatre and Dance related courses as well as dedicated music suites in the "Filey Road Studios" building opposite the campus.

In April 2014, the University released a statement that Scarborough Campus was "not sustainable in the medium to long term", and in June held a public consultation outlining the future of the campus with a new academic model in mind. In March 2015, it was revealed that the [[Hull College|Hull College Group]] were the University's "preferred partners for taking forward the Scarborough Campus". The college returned to its former name, "University College Scarborough" and became part of the Hull College group, but still hosts programmes from both Hull College and the University of Hull.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.hull.ac.uk/scarborough/scarborough-future.aspx|publisher=University of Hull|title=Scarborough Campus Future|accessdate=20 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019175202/http://www2.hull.ac.uk/scarborough/scarborough-future.aspx|archivedate=19 October 2015}}</ref>

* Westfield Court partially opened in 2018, with a full opening in 2019 on the site of the former medical school. It houses a total of 1462 students in a mix of single and cluster flats.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hull.ac.uk/choose-hull/student-life/accommodation/westfield-court.aspx|title=Westfield Court|publisher=University of Hull|accessdate=31 March 2019}}</ref>

In the recent past there were halls of residence in Cottingham at [[The Lawns]], seven halls which could hold around 1,000 students. In March 2019 it was announced that The Lawns would close. Historically, the main concentration of 'traditional' (catered) university halls of residence was in Cottingham. These comprised: Cleminson Hall (closed in 2004), [[Needler Hall]] (closed in 2016), and [[Thwaite Hall]] (closed in 2017). [[Ferens Hall]] was originally a traditional hall, but was later amalgamated with the adjoining Lawns halls. Prior to the mid 1980s, Cleminson and Thwaite halls were exclusively for female residents, Needler and Ferens exclusively for male residents. There was a former on-campus student residence, Loten Hall (now known as the Loten Building).

Student housing is based primarily in the terraced streets around the university campus itself, as well as around the Newland Avenue and Beverley Road areas of the city.
