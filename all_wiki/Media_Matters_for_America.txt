==Founding==
Media Matters for America was founded in May 2004 by [[David Brock]],<ref>{{cite web | last=Hiatt | first=Brian | last2=Hiatt | first2=Brian | title=The 24/7 Fight Against Fox News | website=Rolling Stone | date=July 28, 2019 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/fox-news-media-matters-watchdog-861914/ | access-date=February 2, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115075727/https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/fox-news-media-matters-watchdog-861914/ | archive-date=January 15, 2020 | url-status=live }}</ref> a former [[Left–right political spectrum|conservative]] journalist who has since become a prominent Democratic party political operative. Brock said that he founded the organization to combat the conservative journalism sector that he had once been a part of, although some critics say he has simply adopted the tactics of his part for a new political side. Brock further explained his motives for starting the group, telling ''[[The New York Times]]'', that "the central thrust of his group would be to closely monitor conservative commentators and journalists and, when they make erroneous or misleading claims, to point them out and set the record straight."<ref name="rutenberg" /> 

Brock said he founded the organization because conservative "monitoring groups have helped build the conservative media's influence, in part by making mainstream journalists toe a more conservative line by convincing them that they are liberally biased... The right wing in this country has dominated the debate over liberal bias. By dominating that debate, my belief is they've moved the media itself to the right and therefore they've moved American politics to the right.''<ref name="rutenberg" />

He added, "I wanted to create an institution to combat what they're doing."<ref name="rutenberg" />
 
Brock founded the group with help from the [[Center for American Progress]]. Initial donors included [[Leo Hindery]], [[Susie Tompkins Buell]], and [[James Hormel]].<ref name=rutenberg/>

==Organization overview==

Media Matters analyzes American news sources including [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC, CBS]], [[PBS]], [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]], [[CNBC]], [[One America News Network|OAN]], [[Breitbart News|Breitbart]], the [[Fox News]] channel, and conservative talk radio. Its techniques include [[content analysis]], [[fact checking]], monitoring, and comparison of quotes or presentations from media figures to primary documents such as [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]] or [[Government Accountability Office]] reports.<ref name="rutenberg" /><ref>MMfA has used the [[Government Accountability Office]] in make fact-checking articles.

Beginning in 2006, Media Matters for America has released a number of studies which documented that Democrats and progressives are outnumbered by Republicans and conservatives in terms of guest appearances on television news programs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid%3A458467|first=Kevin|last=Brass|title=Media Watch: Sunday Morning Blues?|date=March 23, 2007|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=September 26, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171705/http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid:458467|archive-date=September 30, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

On September 12, 2007, Media Matters released a comprehensive study of 1,377 U.S. newspapers and the 201 syndicated political columnists the papers carry on a regular basis. Media Matters said "in paper after paper, state after state, and region after region, conservative syndicated columnists get more space than their progressive counterparts."<ref name="Syndicated">{{cite news|url=http://mediamatters.org/research/oped|title=Black and White and Re(a)d All Over: The Conservative Advantage in Syndicated Op-Ed Columnists|publisher=Media Matters for America|date=September 12, 2006|access-date=November 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007014810/http://mediamatters.org/research/oped/|archive-date=October 7, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

John Diaz, editorial page editor of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', said by over-factoring conservative columns in smaller newspapers, Media Matters' study had overestimated how many conservative columns appeared in daily newspapers. Diaz said Media Matters had obscured the nuanced ideological positions of some columnists classified in the study as conservative.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Beyond-the-right-left-labels-2537719.php|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|title=John Diaz An Editor's Note/Beyond the right-left labels|date=September 30, 2007|access-date=November 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203012722/http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Beyond-the-right-left-labels-2537719.php|archive-date=December 3, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2004, MMfA received the endorsement of the [[Democracy Alliance]], a partnership of wealthy and politically active progressive donors. The Alliance itself does not fund endorsees, but many wealthy Alliance members acted on the endorsement and donated directly to MMfA.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/410000040.html|title=A New Alliance of Democrats Spreads Funding; But Some in Party Bristle at Secrecy and Liberal Tilt|date=July 17, 2006|work=The Washington Post|first1=Jim|last1=VandeHei|first2=Chris|last2=Cillizza|page=A1|access-date=May 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203062534/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/410000040.html|archive-date=December 3, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wash.

Media Matters has a policy of not comprehensively listing donors. In 2010, six years after the Democracy Alliance initially endorsed MMfA, financier [[George Soros]] — a founding and continuing member of the Alliance — announced that he was donating $1 million to MMfA. Soros said his concern over "recent evidence suggesting that the incendiary rhetoric of Fox News hosts may incite violence" had moved him to donate to MMfA.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shear|first1=Michael|title=Soros Donates $1 Million to Media Matters|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/soros-donates-1-million-to-media-matters|access-date=September 10, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=October 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908005612/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/soros-donates-1-million-to-media-matters/|archive-date=September 8, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Ben|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1010/Soros_gives_to_Media_Matters_publicly.html|title=Soros gives to Media Matters, publicly|publisher=Politico.com|date=October 20, 2010|access-date=November 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113065909/http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1010/Soros_gives_to_Media_Matters_publicly.html|archive-date=November 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> During a 2014 CNN interview, [[David Brock]] stated that Soros' contributions were "less than 10 percent" of Media Matters' budget.<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1404/27/rs.01.html Transcript of David Brock on Soros contributions to Media Matters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225025247/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1404/27/rs.01.html |date=February 25, 2015 }}, CNN.

==Criticism of conservative media==
===Don Imus===
On April 4, 2007, Media Matters posted a video clip of [[Don Imus]] calling the [[Rutgers University]] [[women's basketball]] team members "nappy-headed hoes" and made their discovery known in Media Matters' daily e-mailing to hundreds of journalists. The next day, according to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', "top news outlets didn't mention the incident." It was objections made to [[CBS Radio]] by the [[National Association of Black Journalists]] that led to an on-the-air apology from Imus. MSNBC, calling Imus's comments "racist" and "abhorrent," suspended Imus' show, and within minutes, CBS suspended Imus's radio show. ''The Wall Street Journal'' said Imus's apology "seemed to make matters worse, with critics latching on to Mr. Imus's use of the phrase 'you people.'" Included among those dissatisfied with Imus's apology and suspension were the coach of the Rutgers team and a group of MSNBC African-American employees. After [[Procter & Gamble]] pulled advertising from all of MSNBC's daytime schedule, and other advertisers, including [[General Motors]] and [[American Express]] requested CBS to cancel any upcoming advertising they had bought for "Imus in the Morning", MSNBC and CBS dropped Imus's show.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB117641076468168180|title=Behind the Fall of Imus, A Digital Brush Fire|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=April 13, 2007|first=Brooks|last=Barnes|access-date=September 9, 2007|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204151349/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB117641076468168180|archive-date=December 4, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Rush Limbaugh "phony soldiers"===
{{Main|Phony soldiers controversy}}
In September 2007, Media Matters' reported radio talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] saying [[Iraq War]] veterans opposed to the war as "the phony soldiers." Limbaugh later said he was speaking of only one soldier, [[Jesse MacBeth]], who had falsely claimed to have been decorated for valor but had never seen combat. Limbaugh said he was the victim of a "smear" by Media Matters, which had taken out of context and selectively edited his comments. After Limbaugh published what he said was the entire transcript of phony soldiers discussion, Media Matters reported that over a minute and 30 seconds was omitted without "notation or ellipsis to indicate that there is, in fact, a break in the transcript."<ref name="mmsmearrecast">{{cite web|title=Limbaugh falsely recasts 'phony soldiers' smear|publisher=Media Matters|date=September 28, 2007|url=http://mediamatters.org/research/2007/09/28/limbaugh-falsely-recasts-phony-soldiers-smear/139980|access-date=August 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010235353/http://mediamatters.org/research/2007/09/28/limbaugh-falsely-recasts-phony-soldiers-smear/139980|archive-date=October 10, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="clipedit">{{cite web|title=Limbaugh selectively edited 'phony soldiers' clip, claimed it was "the entire transcript"|publisher=Media Matters|date=September 28, 2007|url=http://mediamatters.org/research/2007/09/28/limbaugh-selectively-edited-phony-soldiers-clip/139979|access-date=August 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925014757/http://mediamatters.org/research/2007/09/28/limbaugh-selectively-edited-phony-soldiers-clip/139979|archive-date=September 25, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Limbaugh told ''[[National Review]]'' that the gap between referring to "phony soldiers" and MacBeth was a delay because his staff printed out an ABC news story that reported on what it called "phony soldiers" and that his transcript and audio edits were "for space and relevance reasons, not to hide anything."<ref name="RLexplains">{{cite web|title=Limbaugh Makes His Case|work=National Review Online|date=October 3, 2007|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/222373/limbaugh-makes-his-case/byron-york|access-date=August 16, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512221334/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/222373/limbaugh-makes-his-case/byron-york|archive-date=May 12, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Laura Schlessinger racial slur===
On August 12, 2010, Media Matters reported that radio host [[Laura Schlessinger]] said "nigger" eleven times during a discussion with an African-American woman, continuing to say it after the caller took offense at the word. Schlessinger told the woman she was too sensitive and that a double standard determined who could say the word. Schlessinger also said that those "hypersensitive" about color should not "marry outside of their race." The caller had earlier in the discussion said her husband was white.<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/arts/television/19laura.html|work=The New York Times|title='Dr. Laura' Retreats After Use of Epithet|first=Joseph|last=Plambeck|date=August 19, 2010|access-date=February 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812102252/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/arts/television/19laura.html|archive-date=August 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2010/08/12/full-audio-dr-laura-schlessingers-n-word-rant/169161 |title=Full Audio: Dr. Laura Schlessinger's N-word rant |access-date=November 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203064119/http://mediamatters.org/blog/2010/08/12/full-audio-dr-laura-schlessingers-n-word-rant/169161 |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Schlessinger apologized for the epithet the day after the broadcast.

===War on Fox===
In March 2010, MMfA declared a "War on Fox." David Brock said MMfA would focus its efforts on Fox and select conservative websites in what Brock called an "all-out campaign of 'guerrilla warfare and sabotage.'"<ref name=Politico20110326>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/51949.html|title=Media Matters' war against Fox|first=Ben|last=Smith|publisher=Politico|date=March 26, 2011|access-date=March 27, 2011|author-link=Ben Smith (journalist)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110328075934/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/51949.html|archive-date=March 28, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> MMfA said the greater attention given to Fox was part of a campaign to educate the public about what it regarded as the distortions of conservative media, and the greater attention given to Fox was in line with its prominence. MMfA said its Drop Fox campaign for advertisers to boycott Fox was also part of the organisation's educational mission. MMfA said that changing Fox, not shutting it down, was its goal.<ref name="politico">{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/58468.html|title=Fox News takes on Media Matters|publisher=Politico.com|access-date=November 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204012302/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/58468.html|archive-date=December 4, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 2013, the War on Fox was officially concluded, with MMfA Executive VP Angelo Carusone claiming the "War on Fox is over. And it's not just that it's over, but it was very successful. To a large extent, we won," claiming to have "effectively discredited the network's desire to be seen as 'fair and balanced.'" Around that time, [[Glenn Beck]] had departed the network and [[Sean Hannity]]'s time slot was moved from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/13/media-matters-fox_n_4433207.html Quote from MMfA Executive Vice President Angelo Carusone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211184220/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/13/media-matters-fox_n_4433207.html |date=February 11, 2014 }}, ''The Huffington Post''; December 13, 2013.

===Tucker Carlson blog posts===
In March 2019, [[Tucker Carlson#Media Matters for America revelations|MMfA released audio recordings]] of [[Fox News]] host [[Tucker Carlson]], in which he made remarks demeaning to women between 2006 and 2011 on the call-in show hosted by shock jock [[Bubba The Love Sponge]]. Among other comments, Carlson called [[rape shield law]]s "unfair", defended [[Mormon fundamentalist]] church leader [[Warren Jeffs]], who had been charged of [[child sexual assault]], and called women "extremely primitive". After Carlson's remarks had been widely reported, Carlson tweeted: "Media Matters caught me saying something naughty on a radio show more than a decade ago" and declined to apologize.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/11/fox-tucker-carlson-bubba-love-sponge-comments-spark-uproar/3127666002/|title=Tucker Carlson refuses to apologize amid uproar over past comments on 'extremely primitive' women|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728053203/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/11/fox-tucker-carlson-bubba-love-sponge-comments-spark-uproar/3127666002/|archive-date=July 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The following day, MMfA released a second set of audio recordings in which Carlson referred to Iraqis as “semiliterate primitive monkeys” and said they “don’t use toilet paper or forks.” Carlson also suggested that immigrants to the U.S. should be “hot” or “really smart” and that white men “created civilization.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/03/12/new-tucker-carlson-audio-released-this-time-using-racist-homophobic-language/|title=Fox News host Tucker Carlson uses racist, homophobic language in second set of recordings|date=March 11, 2019|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190319225139/https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/03/12/new-tucker-carlson-audio-released-this-time-using-racist-homophobic-language/|archive-date=March 19, 2019|access-date=March 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

''[[The Daily Caller]]'', which Carlson co-founded, responded by resurfacing blog posts made by MMfA's president Angelo Carusone. These blog posts included derogatory comments about transvestites, Jews, and people from Japan and Bangladesh. Carusone responded by saying that posts were supposed to be a "caricature of what a right wing blowhard would sound like if he was living my life" and apologized for the "gross" remarks.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Axelrod |first1=Tal |title=Media Matters president facing scrutiny for derogatory comments, racial slurs in resurfaced posts |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/433979-media-matters-president-made-insensitive-comments-used-racial-slurs-in |work=TheHill |date=13 March 2019 |language=en |access-date=March 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314235320/https://thehill.com/homenews/media/433979-media-matters-president-made-insensitive-comments-used-racial-slurs-in |archive-date=March 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Palmer |first1=Ewan |title=Donald Trump Jr. wants to know where's the outrage over Media Matters president's blog comments |url=https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-jr-media-matters-angelo-carusone-blog-tucker-carlson-1362709 |work=Newsweek |date=14 March 2019 |language=en |access-date=March 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314185730/https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-jr-media-matters-angelo-carusone-blog-tucker-carlson-1362709 |archive-date=March 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Levine |first1=Jon |title=Tucker Carlson Lashes Out at Media Matters Chief Angelo Carusone Over Past ‘Racist Blog’ |url=https://www.thewrap.com/tucker-carlson-lashes-out-at-media-matters-chief-angelo-carusone-over-past-racist-blog/ |work=www.thewrap.com |access-date=March 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314215212/https://www.thewrap.com/tucker-carlson-lashes-out-at-media-matters-chief-angelo-carusone-over-past-racist-blog/ |archive-date=March 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Choi |first1=David |title='Everything is irony': Fox News' Tucker Carlson fires back at progressive watchdog amid resurrected offensive statements |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-tucker-carlson-media-matters-blog-posts-2019-3 |work=Business Insider |access-date=March 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328043409/https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-tucker-carlson-media-matters-blog-posts-2019-3 |archive-date=March 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Erik Wemple]], writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', expressed scepticism at Carusone's parody explanation.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wemple |first1=Erik |title=Media Matters president apologizes for offensive statements on old blog |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/14/media-matters-president-apologizes-offensive-statements-old-blog/ |work=Washington Post |date=14 March 2019 |language=en |access-date=March 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315050917/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/14/media-matters-president-apologizes-offensive-statements-old-blog/ |archive-date=March 15, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Reception==
In 2008, columnist [[Jacques Steinberg]] of ''The New York Times'' quoted [[David Folkenflik]] of [[National Public Radio]] as telling him that although Media Matters looked "at every dangling participle, every dependent clause, every semicolon, every quotation" for the benefit of "a cause, a party, a candidate, that they may have some feelings for", they were still a useful source for leads, partly due to the "breadth of their research." Steinberg further explained: "Ripping a page from an old Republican Party playbook, Media Matters has given the Democrats a weapon they have not had in previous campaigns: a rapid-fire, technologically sophisticated means to call out what it considers “conservative misinformation” on air or in print, then feed it to a Rolodex of reporters, cable channels and bloggers hungry for grist."<ref name=NYTProfile/>

Conversely, political analyst and columnist [[Stuart Rothenberg]] told Steinberg that he did not pay attention to them, as he had no confidence in "ideological stuff." In Steinberg's view, Media Matters is a new weapon for the Democratic Party employing "rapid-fire, technologically sophisticated means to call out what it considers 'conservative misinformation' on air or in print, then feed it to a Rolodex of reporters, cable channels and bloggers hungry for grist."<ref name=NYTProfile/>

According to a 2010 opinion piece by "M. S." on the blog of ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, "because it is dedicated to critiquing distortions by conservatives, its critiques carry no weight with conservatives."<ref>{{cite news|author=M.S.|title=Epistemic closure and political disinformation|work=[[The Economist]]|date=May 5, 2010|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/05/health-care_reform|access-date=July 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816034937/https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/05/health-care_reform|archive-date=August 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Some news organizations have cited Media Matters reports and credited it for bringing attention to issues including the story of James Guckert, formerly a reporter for the web-based ''[[Talon News]]''.  During [[George W. Bush]]'s administration, Guckert gained White House press access using the pseudonym [[Jeff Gannon]] and attended 155 White House press briefings.  It was revealed that he had also worked as a prostitute soliciting male clientele on the Internet with photos of himself fully naked.<ref name="urlWeb-Houston Chronicle">{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/business/technology/article/Web-CEO-in-midst-of-political-scandal-1926513.php|title=Web CEO in midst of political scandal|access-date=May 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019074052/http://www.chron.com/business/technology/article/Web-CEO-in-midst-of-political-scandal-1926513.php|archive-date=October 19, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Leftist columnists and writers such as [[Paul Krugman]] and the late [[Molly Ivins]] cited Media Matters or identified it as a helpful source.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/11/ivins.future.journalism/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=CNN.com – Molly Ivins: Developments in journalism's frontier|date=May 11, 2006|access-date=May 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609093646/http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/11/ivins.future.journalism/index.html|archive-date=June 9, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/the-oil-spill-is-obamas-fault|work=The New York Times|title=The Oil Spill Is Obama's Fault|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=April 30, 2010|access-date=February 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908002223/http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/the-oil-spill-is-obamas-fault/|archive-date=September 8, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2015, Emma Roller in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' described MMFA as part of Brock's "three-pronged empire", along with the super [[political action committee|PACs]] [[American Bridge 21st Century]] and [[Correct the Record]].
