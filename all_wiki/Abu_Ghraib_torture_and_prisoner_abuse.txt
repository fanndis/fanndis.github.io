Documents popularly known as the [[Torture Memos]] came to light a few years later. These documents, prepared shortly before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by the [[United States Department of Justice]], authorized certain [[enhanced interrogation techniques]], (generally held to involve torture) of foreign detainees. The memoranda also argued that [[International law|international humanitarian laws]], such as the [[Geneva Conventions]], did not apply to American interrogators overseas. Several subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, including ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2006), have overturned Bush administration policy, and ruled that the Geneva Conventions apply.

In response to the events at Abu Ghraib, the United States Department of Defense removed 17 soldiers and officers from duty. Eleven soldiers were charged with [[dereliction of duty]], maltreatment, [[aggravated assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]]. Between May 2004 and April 2006, these soldiers were [[courts-martial|court-martialed]], convicted, sentenced to military prison, and [[dishonorable discharge|dishonorably discharged]] from service. Two soldiers, Specialist [[Charles Graner]] and PFC [[Lynndie England]], were sentenced to ten and three years in prison, respectively. [[Brigadier General]] [[Janis Karpinski]], the commanding officer of all detention facilities in Iraq, was reprimanded and demoted to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. Several more military personnel who were accused of perpetrating or authorizing the measures, including many of higher rank, were not prosecuted. In 2004, President [[George W. Bush]] and Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] apologized for the Abu Ghraib abuses. Numerous news articles reported that Israelis were employed by the Coalition as interrogators because they spoke Arabic.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3863235.stm</ref><ref>https://www.democracynow.org/2016/4/7/ex_abu_ghraib_interrogator_israelis_trained</ref>

===Abu Ghraib prison===
{{Further|Abu Ghraib prison}}
The [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in the town of [[Abu Ghraib]] was one of the most notorious prisons in Iraq during the government of Saddam Hussein. The prison was used to hold approximately 50,000 men and women in poor conditions, and torture and execution were frequent.<ref name="Hersh 2004"/> The prison was located on 280 acres of land 32 kilometers west of [[Baghdad]].<ref name="Fast facts">{{cite web|author=CNN Library|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/30/world/meast/iraq-prison-abuse-scandal-fast-facts/|title=Iraq Prison Abuse Scandal Fast Facts|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2016-03-12|access-date=2016-09-17|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905090342/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/30/world/meast/iraq-prison-abuse-scandal-fast-facts/|archive-date=September 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After the collapse of Saddam Hussein's government, the prison was looted and everything that was removable was carried away.

Three categories of prisoners were imprisoned at Abu Ghraib by the U.S. military. These were "common criminals", individuals suspected of being leaders of the insurgency, and individuals suspected of committing crimes against the occupational force led by the U.S.{{sfn|Hersh|2004|pp=20-21}} Although most prisoners lived in tents in the yard, the abuses took place inside cell blocks 1a and 1b.<ref name="Fast facts"/> The 800th Military Police Brigade, from [[Uniondale, New York|Uniondale]], New York, was responsible for running the prison.<ref name="ASIL 2004"/> The brigade was commanded by Brigadier General [[Janis Karpinski]], who was in charge of all of the U.S.-run prisons in Iraq. She did not have previous experience in running a prison.{{sfn|Hersh|2004|pp=20-21}} The individuals who committed abuses at the prison were members of the 372nd Military Police Company, which was a constituent of the 320th Military Police Battalion, which was overseen by Karpinski's Brigade headquarters.{{sfn|Hersh|2004|p=22}}

The [[Fay Report]] noted that "contracting-related issues contributed to the problems at Abu Ghraib prison". Over half the interrogators working at the prison were employees of [[CACI International]], while [[Titan Corporation]] supplied linguistics personnel. In his report, General Fay notes that "The general policy of not contracting for intelligence functions and services was designed in part to avoid many of the problems that eventually developed at Abu Ghraib..."<ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 16| pages = 25| last = Schooner| first = Steven L| title = Contractor Atrocities at Abu Ghraib: Compromised Accountability in a Streamlined, Outsourced Government| journal = Policy Review| url = https://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&context=faculty_publications| date = 2005| access-date = July 12, 2018| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170904211537/http://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&context=faculty_publications| archive-date = September 4, 2017| url-status = live| df = mdy-all}}</ref>

On July 23, 2003, Amnesty International issued a press release condemning widespread human rights abuses by U.S. and coalition forces. The release stated that prisoners had been exposed to extreme heat, not provided clothing, and forced to use open trenches for toilets. They had also been tortured, with the methods including denial of sleep for extended periods, exposure to bright lights and loud music, and being restrained in uncomfortable positions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amnesty.nl/nieuwsportaal/pers/continuing-failure-uphold-human-rights |title=Iraq: Continuing failure to uphold human rights |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=July 23, 2003 |publisher=Amnesty International |access-date=February 6, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207004452/http://www.amnesty.nl/nieuwsportaal/pers/continuing-failure-uphold-human-rights |archive-date=February 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On November 1, 2003, the [[Associated Press]] presented a special report on the massive human rights abuses at Abu Ghraib. Their report began; "In Iraq's American detention camps, forbidden talk can earn a prisoner hours bound and stretched out in the sun, and detainees swinging tent poles rise up regularly against their jailers, according to recently released Iraqis." The report went on to describe abuse of the prisoners at the hands of their American captors: "'They confined us like sheep,' the newly freed Saad Naif, 38, said of the Americans. 'They hit people. They humiliated people.'" In response, U.S. Brigadier General [[Janis Karpinski]], who oversaw all U.S. detention facilities in Iraq, claimed that prisoners were being treated "humanely and fairly."<ref name="AP 2003">{{cite web |url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/world/iraq/20031101-0936-iraq-thecamps.html |title=AP Enterprise: Former Iraqi detainees tell of riots, punishment in the sun, good Americans and pitiless ones |last1=Hanley |first1=Charles J. |date=November 1, 2003 |website=utsandiego.com |publisher=San Diego Union Tribune |access-date=April 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503221406/http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/world/iraq/20031101-0936-iraq-thecamps.html |archive-date=May 3, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The AP report also stated that as of November 1, 2003, there were two legal cases pending against U.S. military personnel; one involving the beating of an Iraqi prisoner, while the other arose out of the death of a prisoner in custody.<ref name="AP 2003"/>

Since the beginning of the invasion, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) had been allowed to oversee the prison, and submitted reports about the treatment of the prisoners.

The author also stated that [[the Pentagon]] had limited use of the techniques by requiring specific authorization from the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]. The author identifies "physical beatings, sexual humiliation or touching" as being outside the Executive Order.

===Systematic torture===
[[File:Abu Ghraib 64.jpg|thumb|A detainee handcuffed in the nude to a bed with female [[panties]] soaked in urine covering his face.]]

On May 7, 2004, [[Pierre Krähenbühl]], Operations Director for the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC), stated that inspection visits made by the ICRC to detention centers run by the U.S. and its allies showed that acts of prisoner abuse were not isolated acts, but were part of a "pattern and a broad system." He went on to say that some of the incidents they had observed were "tantamount to torture".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3694521.stm | title=Red Cross saw 'widespread abuse' | date=May 8, 2004 | work=BBC News | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040722000029/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3694521.stm | archive-date=July 22, 2004 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Many of the torture techniques used were developed at Guantánamo detention center, including prolonged isolation; the [[Frequent flyer program (Guantanamo)|frequent flyer program]], a sleep deprivation program whereby people were moved from cell to cell every few hours so they could not sleep for days, weeks, or even months; [[short shackling]] in painful positions; nudity; extreme use of heat and cold; the use of loud music and noise; and preying on phobias.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wikileaksdecrypted.com/guantanamo-torture-columbia-university/|title=Investigative Reporter Andy Worthington on Guantanamo Torture|website=wikileaksdecrypted.com|access-date=2016-12-02|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220030351/http://wikileaksdecrypted.com/guantanamo-torture-columbia-university/|archive-date=December 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=January 2018}}

Armed forces in the U.S. and the UK are jointly trained in techniques known as ''[[R2I|resistance to interrogation]] (R2I)'' techniques. These R2I techniques are taught ostensibly to help soldiers cope with, or resist, torture if they are captured. On May 8, 2004, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that according to a former British special forces officer, the acts committed by the Abu Ghraib prison military personnel resembled the techniques used in R2I training.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12956,1212199,00.html | location=London | title=UK forces taught torture methods | date=May 8, 2004 | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Leigh | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040530070404/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12956,1212199,00.html | archive-date=May 30, 2004 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

{{Quote|The US commander in charge of military jails in Iraq, Major General [[Geoffrey Miller (general)|Geoffrey Miller]], has confirmed that a battery of 50-odd special "coercive techniques" can be used against enemy detainees.

Historian [[Alfred W.

===Casualties===
A 2006 study tried to count the number of deaths by looking at public domain reports, as total figures had not been given by the US government. It counted 63 detainee deaths at Abu Ghraib from all causes. 36 of these deaths occurred due to insurgent mortar attacks, others were due to natural causes and homicide.<ref name=med>{{cite journal|author=Scott A.

In late April 2004, the U.S. television news-magazine ''[[60 Minutes II]]'', a franchise of [[CBS]], broadcast a story on the abuse. The story included photographs depicting the abuse of prisoners.<ref name="main614063.shtml">{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/27/60II/main614063.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Abuse Of Iraqi POWs By GIs Probed | date=April 27, 2004 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208135011/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/27/60II/main614063.shtml | archive-date=February 8, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The news segment was delayed by two weeks at the request of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[Richard Myers]], an air force general and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. After learning that ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine planned to publish an article and photographs on the topic in its next issue, CBS proceeded to broadcast its report on April 28.<ref name="zmag itemID 7926"/> In the CBS report, [[Dan Rather]] interviewed then-deputy director of Coalition operations in Iraq, Brigadier General [[Mark Kimmitt]], who said:

{{Quote|The first thing I'd say is we're appalled as well. These are our fellow soldiers. These are the people we work with every day, and they represent us. They wear the same uniform as us, and they let their fellow soldiers down [...] Our soldiers could be taken prisoner as well. And we expect our soldiers to be treated well by the adversary, by the enemy. And if we can't hold ourselves up as an example of how to treat people with dignity and respect [...] We can't ask that other nations do that to our soldiers as well. [...] So what would I tell the people of Iraq? This is wrong. This is reprehensible. But this is not representative of the 150,000 soldiers that are over here [...] I'd say the same thing to the American people ... Don't judge your army based on the actions of a few.''<ref name="main614063.shtml" />''}}

Kimmitt also acknowledged that he knew of other cases of abuse during the American occupation of Iraq.<ref name="main614063.shtml"/> Bill Cowan, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, was also interviewed, and said: "We went into Iraq to stop things like this from happening, and indeed, here they are happening under our tutelage."<ref name="main614063.shtml"/> In addition, Rather interviewed Army Reserve Staff Sergeant [[Ivan Frederick]], who was party to some of the abuses. Frederick's civilian job was as a corrections officer at a Virginia prison. He said, "We had no support, no training whatsoever. And I kept asking my chain of command for certain things ... like rules and regulations, and it just wasn't happening."<ref name="main614063.shtml"/> Frederick's video diary, sent home from Iraq, provided some of the images used in the story. In it he listed detailed, dated, entries that chronicled abuse of CIA prisoners, as well as their names: "The next day the medics came in and put his body on a stretcher, placed a fake [intravenous drip] in his arm and took him away. This [CIA prisoner] was never processed and therefore never had a number."<ref name="shane">{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-05-01/news/0405010122_1_prisoner-military-intelligence-cells|title=Soldier's diary details wider abuse at prison - Baltimore Sun|last=Shane|first=Scott|date=May 1, 2004|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|access-date=March 5, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610195115/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-05-01/news/0405010122_1_prisoner-military-intelligence-cells|archive-date=June 10, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Frederick implicated the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Military Intelligence Corps]] as well, saying "MI has been present and witnessed such activity.

In 2004, [[Seymour M. Hersh]] authored an article in ''The New Yorker'' magazine discussing the abuses in detail, and used as its source a copy of the Taguba report. Under the direction of editor [[David Remnick]], the magazine also posted a report on its website by Hersh, along with a number of images of the torture taken by U.S. military prison guards. The article, entitled "Torture at Abu Ghraib", was followed in the next two weeks by two further articles on the same subject, "Chain of Command" and "The Gray Zone", also by Hersh.<ref name="zmag itemID 7926">{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&ItemID=7926 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090701041008/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&ItemID=7926 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 1, 2009 |title=ZNet &#124;Iraq &#124; Abu Ghraib |publisher=Zmag.org |access-date=April 3, 2012 }}</ref>

===Later coverage, 2006===
In February 2006, previously unreleased photos and videos were broadcast by [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]], an Australian television network, on its [[Dateline (Australian TV program)|''Dateline'']] program. The Bush administration attempted to prevent release of the images in the U.S., arguing that their publication could provoke antagonism. These newly released photographs depicted prisoners crawling on the floor naked, being forced to perform sexual acts, and being covered in feces. Some images also showed prisoners killed by the soldiers, some shot in the head and some with slit throats. BBC World News stated that one of the prisoners, who was reportedly mentally unstable, was considered by prison guards as a "pet" for torture.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://smh.com.au/news/world/the-photos-america-doesnt-want-seen/2006/02/14/1139890737099.html# |title=The photos America doesn't want seen – World – |work=Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=April 3, 2012 |date=February 15, 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412221602/http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/the-photos-america-doesnt-want-seen/2006/02/14/1139890737099.html |archive-date=April 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The UN expressed hope that the pictures would be investigated immediately, but the Pentagon stated that the images "have been previously investigated as part of the Abu Ghraib investigation."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18166472-26619,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107133700/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C10117%2C18166472-26619%2C00.html|url-status=dead|title=Anger at Abu Ghraib photos &#124; NEWS.com.au<!-- Bot generated title -->|archive-date=November 7, 2007}}</ref>

===Response of U.S. government===
The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] did not initially acknowledge the abuses at Abu Ghraib. After the pictures were published and the evidence became incontrovertible, the initial reaction from the administration characterized the scandal as an isolated incident uncharacteristic of U.S. actions in Iraq.<ref name="Smeulers"/> Bush described the abuses as the actions of a few individuals, who were disregarding the values of the US.<ref name="Smeulers"/> This view was widely disputed, notably in Arab countries. In addition, the [[International Red Cross]] had been making representations about abuse of prisoners for more than a year before the scandal broke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf |title=Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the Treatment by the Coalition Forces of Prisoners of War and Other Protected Persons by the Geneva Conventions in Iraq During Arrest, Internment and Interrogation |publisher=ICRC |date=February 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513090151/http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf |archive-date=May 13, 2008 }}</ref> Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]'s office had played a central role in eliminating limits on coercion in U.S. custody, commissioning and defending legal opinions that the administration later portrayed as the initiatives of lower-ranking officials.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/cheney/chapters/pushing_the_envelope_on_presi/|title=Pushing the Envelope on Presidential Power|access-date=September 16, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=January 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309121555/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/cheney/chapters/pushing_the_envelope_on_presi/|archive-date=March 9, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On May 7, 2004, President Bush publicly apologized for the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib, stating that he was "'sorry for the humiliations suffered by the Iraqi prisoners and the humiliations suffered by their families'". In an appearance with King Abdullah II of Jordan, Bush said he had told the king that he was "'equally sorry that the people that have been seeing those pictures did not understand the true nature and the heart of America, and I assured him that Americans like me didn't appreciate what we saw and it made us sick to our stomachs'". Describing the abuse as "'abhorrent'" and "'a stain on our country's honor and our country's reputation'", Bush added that "those responsible for the maltreatment 'will be brought to justice'" and that he would prevent the occurrence of future abuses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/05/07/bush.apology/|title=CNN.com - Bush 'sorry' for abuse of Iraqi prisoners - May 7, 2004|website=cnn.com|access-date=September 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111153656/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/05/07/bush.apology/|archive-date=January 11, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

On the same day, United States Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] said the following in a hearing before the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]]:

{{Quote|These events occurred on my watch. As Secretary of Defense, I am accountable for them. I take full responsibility. It is my obligation to evaluate what happened, to make sure those who have committed wrongdoing are brought to justice, and to make changes as needed to see that it doesn't happen again. I feel terrible about what happened to these Iraqi detainees. They are human beings. They were in U.S. custody. Our country had an obligation to treat them right. We didn't do that. That was wrong. To those Iraqis who were mistreated by members of U.S. armed forces, I offer my deepest apology. It was un-American.

He also commented on the very existence of the evidence of abuse:
{{Quote|We're functioning in a – with peacetime restraints, with legal requirements in a wartime situation, in the information age, where people are running around with digital cameras and taking these unbelievable photographs and then passing them off, against the law, to the media, to our surprise, when they had not even arrived in the Pentagon.<ref>{{cite web |last=Washington |first=The |url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040507-115901-6736r.htm |title=Washington Times – Iraq prisoner abuse 'un-American,' says Rumsfeld |publisher=Washtimes.com |date=May 7, 2004 |access-date=April 3, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613172647/http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040507-115901-6736r.htm |archive-date=June 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}

Rumsfeld was careful to draw a distinction between abuse and [[torture]]: "What has been charged so far is abuse, which I believe technically is different from torture.

[[James Inhofe]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services]], stated that the events were being blown out of proportion: "I'm probably not the only one up at this table that is more outraged by the outrage than we are by the treatment [...] [They] are not there for traffic violations.

On May 26, 2004, [[Al Gore]] gave a sharply critical speech on the scandal and the Iraq War. He called for the resignations of Rumsfeld, [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], CIA Director [[George Tenet]], Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Paul Wolfowitz]], Under Secretary of Defense for Policy [[Douglas J. Feith]], and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence [[Stephen A. Cambone]], for encouraging policies that led to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and fanned hatred of Americans abroad. Gore also called the Bush administration's Iraq war plan "incompetent" and described Bush as the most dishonest president since [[Richard Nixon]]. Gore commented; "In Iraq, what happened at that prison, it is now clear, is not the result of random acts of a few bad apples. It was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moveonpac.org/goreremarks052604.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040609101212/http://www.moveonpac.org/goreremarks052604.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 9, 2004 |title=MoveOn PAC |publisher=MoveOn PAC |access-date=April 3, 2012 }}</ref>{{better source|date=September 2019}}

=== Iraqi response ===
The news website [[AsiaNews]] quoted Yahia Said, an Iraqi scholar at the [[London School of Economics]], as saying: "The reception [of the news about Abu Ghraib] was surprisingly low-key in Iraq. Part of the reason was that rumors and tall stories, as well as true stories, about abuse, mass rape, and torture in the jails and in coalition custody have been going round for a long time. So compared to what people have been talking about here the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: why did they come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there's some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point."<ref name=iraqreaction1>{{cite web|url=http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l%3Den%26art%3D791 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-02-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134347/http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&art=791 |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> [[CNN]] reporter [[Ben Wedeman]] reported that Iraqi reaction to George W.

[[Stanley A. McChrystal|General Stanley McChrystal]], who held several command positions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said that, "In my experience, we found that nearly every first-time jihadist claimed Abu Ghraib had first jolted him into action."{{sfn|McChrystal|2013|p=172}} He also said that, "mistreating detainees would discredit us. ... The pictures [from] Abu Ghraib represented a setback for America's efforts in Iraq. Simultaneously undermining U.S. domestic confidence in the way in which America was operating, and creating or reinforcing negative perceptions worldwide of American values, it fueled violence".{{sfn|McChrystal|2013|pp=200-201}}

On 2015-11-27, this Wikipedia article listed a beheading in Paikistan almost 27 months before the Abu Ghraib revelations.  It then lists 10 beheadings in the next 6 months.  The next video is just over 4 years later on Feb. 7, 2009 in Pakistan, possibly before Miles' completed his book.  This count of beheadings seems consistent with Miles' comment, even if it does not match perfectly.  Miles continues, "Pursuing justice differs from being consumed by revenge.  The former proceeds from crime to investigation, to trial, to punishment, and then to closure.  Vengeance is a whirlwind, where atrocity justifies revenge, and revenge becomes an atrocity."</ref>

===Scholarly analysis===
In 2008, scholars Alette Smeulers and Sander van Niekerk published an article entitled "Abu Ghraib and the War on Terror—a case against Donald Rumsfeld?".<ref name="Smeulers"/> According to the authors, the [[September 11 attacks]] led to demands from the public that U.S. president George W. Bush take actions that would prevent further attacks.<ref name="Smeulers"/> This pressure led to the launch of the [[War on Terror]].<ref name="Smeulers"/>{{Better source|date=August 2018}} Smeulers and van Niekerk argued that because the perceived enemies in the War on Terror were stateless individuals, and because the perceived threats included extreme strategies such as [[suicide bombing]], the Bush administration was under pressure to act decisively in the War on Terror.<ref name="Smeulers"/> In addition, these tactics created the perception that the "legitimate" techniques used in the [[Cold War]] would not be of much use. The article noted that Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] has stated that the United States "[had] to work sort of on the dark side", and that it had to "use any means at [its] disposal".<ref name="Smeulers"/> Smeulers and van Niekerk opined that the abuses at Abu Ghraib constituted state-sanctioned crimes.<ref name="Smeulers"/> Scholar Michelle Brown agreed.<ref name="Brown 2005"/>

A number of feminist academics have examined how ideas of masculinity and race likely influenced the violence perpetrated at Abu Ghraib.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Eichert |first1= David|date= 2019|title= 'Homosexualization' Revisited: An Audience-Focused Theorization of Wartime Male Sexual Violence|journal= International Feminist Journal of Politics|volume= 21|issue= 3|pages= 409–433|doi= 10.1080/14616742.2018.1522264|s2cid= 150313647}}</ref> [[Laura Sjoberg]], for example, has argued that the sexual humiliation of detainees was meant to mark “the victory of hegemonic American manliness over subordinated Iraqi masculinities.”<ref>{{cite book | last = Sjoberg | first = Laura| title = Gender, Justice, and the Wars in Iraq| publisher = Lexington Books| date = 2006| location = Oxford| pages = 143}}</ref> Similarly, [[Jasbir Puar]] and others have pointed out how ideas about American cultural supremacy over the "sexually repressed" and "homophobic" Muslim detainees were used to dehumanize victims.<ref>{{cite book | last = Puar| first = Jasbir| title = Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times| publisher = Duke University Press| date = 2007| location = Durham, NC| pages = 94}}</ref>

==Repercussions==

===Convictions of soldiers===
[[File:Navy consolidated brig -- Mirimar CA.jpg|thumb|[[Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar]], where [[Lynndie England|England]] and Harman served their sentences]]

Eleven soldiers were convicted of various charges relating to the incidents, with all of the convictions including the charge of [[dereliction of duty]]. Most soldiers only received minor sentences. Three other soldiers were either cleared of charges or were not charged. No one was convicted for the murders of the detainees.

* Colonel [[Thomas Pappas]] was relieved of his command on May 13, 2005, after receiving [[non-judicial punishment]] for two instances of dereliction of duty, including that of allowing dogs to be present during interrogations. He was fined $8000 under the provisions of Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (non-judicial punishment). He also received a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand which effectively ended his military career. He did not face criminal prosecution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/may/12/20050512-111801-2679r/ |title=Colonel loses command for abuses |publisher=Washington Times |date=12 May 2005 |access-date=2016-08-08 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809110733/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/may/12/20050512-111801-2679r/ |archive-date=August 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Legal issues==

===International law===

The United States has ratified the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]] and the [[Third Geneva Convention|Third]] and [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]s. The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] took the position that: "Both the United States and Iraq are parties to the Geneva Conventions. The United States recognizes that these treaties are binding in the war for the 'liberation of Iraq'".<ref>Alberto Gonzales, OP-ED: "The Rule of Law and the Rules of War", ''The New York Times'', May 15, 2004</ref>
[[File:Abu Ghraib 22.jpg|thumb|A U.S. soldier beats a bleeding Iraqi detainee]]

The Convention Against Torture defines [[torture]] in the following terms:
{{Quote|For the purposes of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person, information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.|[[United Nations Convention Against Torture]]|(Article 1)}}
[[File:Abu Ghraib 29.JPG|thumb|upright=0.5|A nude prisoner used as a target for shooting practice by U.S. soldiers.]]

According to [[Human Rights Watch]]:
{{quote|Al-Qaeda detainees would likely not be accorded [[Prisoner of War]] (POW) status, but the Conventions still provide explicit protections to all persons held in an international armed conflict, even if they are not entitled to POW status. Such protections include the right to be free from coercive interrogation, to receive a fair trial if charged with a criminal offense, and, in the case of detained civilians, to be able to appeal periodically the security rationale for continued detention.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/12123/section/3 |title="The Road to Abu Ghraib", Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=June 9, 2004 |access-date=April 3, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011111447/http://www.hrw.org/en/node/12123/section/3 |archive-date=October 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) concluded in its confidential February 2004 report to the Coalition Forces (CF) that it had documented "serious violations" of international law in connection with prisoners held in Iraq. The ICRD added that its report "establishes that persons deprived of their liberty face the risk of being subjected to a process of physical and psychological coercion, in some cases tantamount to torture, in the early stages of the internment process".<ref name="ICRC04report"/> There were several major violations described in the ICRC report. These included brutality against protected persons upon capture and initial custody, sometimes causing death or serious injury; absence of notification of arrest of persons deprived of their liberty to their families causing distress among persons deprived of their liberty and their families; physical or psychological coercion during interrogation to secure information; prolonged solitary confinement in cells devoid of daylight; excessive and disproportionate use of force against persons deprived of their liberty resulting in death or injury during their period of internment.<ref name="ICRC04report">{{cite web|url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf |title=Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the Treatment by the Coalition Forces of Prisoners of War and Other Protected Persons by the Geneva Conventions in Iraq During Arrest, Internment and Interrogation (section 3.1) |publisher=ICRC |date=February 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513090151/http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf |archive-date=May 13, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Some legal experts have said that the United States could be obligated to try some of its soldiers for [[war crimes]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war and civilians detained in a war may not be treated in a degrading manner, and violation of that section is a "grave breach". In a November 5, 2003 report on prisons in Iraq, the Army's provost marshal, Maj. Gen. Donald J. Ryder, stated that the conditions under which prisoners were held sometimes violated the Geneva Conventions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===United Nations resolution 1546===
In December 2005, John Pace, human rights chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), criticized the U.S. military's practice of holding Iraqi prisoners in Iraqi facilities such as Abu Ghraib. Pace stated that this practice was not mandated by UN Resolution 1546, according to which the U.S. government has claimed a legal mandate permitting its ongoing occupation of Iraq. Pace said, "All except those held by the Ministry of Justice are, technically speaking, held against the law because the Ministry of Justice is the only authority that is empowered by law to detain, to hold anybody in prison. Essentially none of these people have any real recourse to protection and therefore we speak ... of a total breakdown in the protection of the individual in this country."<ref>Quoted in ''The Age'', December 6, 2005, {{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/america-abusing-mandate-in-iraq/2005/12/05/1133631201911.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-06-23 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516033839/http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/america-abusing-mandate-in-iraq/2005/12/05/1133631201911.html |archive-date=May 16, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Torture Memos===
[[Alberto Gonzales]] and other senior administration lawyers argued that detainees at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] and other similar prisons should be considered "[[unlawful combatant]]s" and were not protected by the [[Geneva Conventions]]. These opinions were issued in multiple memoranda, known today as the "[[Torture Memos]]", in August 2002, by the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] (OLC) in the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/02/23/yoo/index_np.html |title=Walter Shapiro, "Parsing pain" |access-date=September 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307223219/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/02/23/yoo/index_np.html |archive-date=March 7, 2008 }}</ref> They were written by [[John Yoo]], deputy assistant attorney-general in the OLC, and two of three were signed by his boss [[Jay Bybee|Jay S.

An additional memo was issued on March 14, 2003, after the resignation of Bybee, and just prior to the American invasion of Iraq.

===Other legal proceedings===
In ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2006), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] ruled that Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions applied to all detainees in the [[War on Terror]]. It said that the [[Guantanamo military commission|military tribunals]] used to try these suspects were in violation of U.S. and international law. It said that the president could not unilaterally establish such tribunals, and that Congress needed to authorize a means by which detainees could confront their accusers and challenge their detention.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060718003322/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13773997/site/newsweek/ Michael Isikoff and Stuart Taylor Jr., "The Gitmo Fallout: The fight over the Hamdan ruling heats up—as fears about its reach escalate"], ''Newsweek,'' July 17, 2006</ref>

In June 2014, the U.S. court of appeals in Richmond, Virginia, found that an 18th-century law known as the [[Alien Tort Statute]], allowed non-US citizens access to U.S. courts for violations of "the law of nations or a treaty of the United States". This would enable abused Iraqis to file suit against contractor CACI International. Employees of CACI International are being accused of encouraging torture and abuse as well as taking part in it as the four Iraqi's contend that they were "repeatedly shot in the head with a taser gun", "beaten on the genitals with a stick", and forced to watch the "rape [of] a female detainee", during their time at the prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/30/iraq-lawsuit-defense-contractor-torture-abu-graib|title=Abu Ghraib torture suit against contractor revived by federal court - Law - theguardian.com|author=Spencer Ackerman|work=the Guardian|access-date=September 16, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805225638/http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/30/iraq-lawsuit-defense-contractor-torture-abu-graib|archive-date=August 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Critics consider the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] an amnesty law for crimes committed in the War on Terror by retroactively rewriting the War Crimes Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20061016/ratner|title=Michael Ratner, Center for Constitutional Rights|date=October 16, 2006|access-date=September 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428083852/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20061016/ratner|archive-date=April 28, 2007|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It abolished [[habeas corpus]] for foreign detainees, effectively making it impossible for detainees to challenge crimes committed against them.<ref>Military Commissions Act of 2006</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dorf/20061011.html|title=MICHAEL C.

==Later developments==
On October 29, 2007, the memoir of a soldier stationed in Abu Ghraib, Iraq from 2005 to 2006 was published. ''[[Torture Central]]'' chronicled many events previously unreported in the news media, including torture that continued at Abu Ghraib over a year after the abuse photos were published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torturecentral.com| title=Torture Central| author=Michael Keller|year=2007| access-date=November 11, 2007| publisher=iUniverse| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071123092432/http://www.torturecentral.com/| archive-date= November 23, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In 2010, the last of the prisons were turned over to the Iraqi government to run. An [[Associated Press]] article said {{quote|Despite Abu Ghraib- or perhaps because of reforms in its wake- prisoners have more recently said they receive far better treatment in American custody than in Iraqi jails.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Sameer | last=Yacoub | title=Changing of the guard at last U.S. run prison | publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 8A | date=July 15, 2010 }}</ref>}}

In September 2010, [[Amnesty International]] warned in a report titled ''New Order, Same Abuses; Unlawful Detentions and Torture in Iraq'' that up to 30,000 prisoners, including many veterans of the U.S. detention system, remain detained without rights in Iraq and are frequently tortured or abused. Furthermore, it describes a detention system that has not evolved since Saddam Hussein's regime, in which human rights abuses were endemic with arbitrary arrests and secret detention common and a lack of accountability throughout the military forces. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Malcolm Smart went on to say: "Iraq's security forces have been responsible for systematically violating detainees' rights and they have been permitted. U.S. authorities, whose own record on detainees' rights has been so poor, have now handed over thousands of people detained by U.S. forces to face this catalogue of illegality, violence and abuse, abdicating any responsibility for their human rights."<ref>{{cite news |author=Martin Chulov |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/iraq-prisons-and-probation |title=Abuse and torture rife in Iraqi prisons |work=The Guardian |access-date=April 3, 2012 |date=September 23, 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917001303/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/iraq-prisons-and-probation |archive-date=September 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On October 22, 2010, nearly 400,000 secret United States Army [[Iraq War documents leak|field reports and war logs]], detailing torture, [[summary execution]]s and war crimes, were passed on to the British paper, ''[[The Guardian]]'', and several other international media organisations through the [[Whistleblower|whistleblowing]] website [[WikiLeaks]]. Among other things, the logs detail how U.S. authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape, and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers, whose conduct appeared to be systematic and normally unpunished, and that U.S. troops abused prisoners for years even after the Abu Ghraib scandal.<ref>{{cite news |author=Nick Davies, Jonathan Steele and David Leigh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks |title=Iraq war logs: secret files show how U.S. ignored torture |work=The Guardian |access-date=April 3, 2012 |date=October 22, 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730184021/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks |archive-date=July 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/22/wikileaks-iraq-war-logs-i_n_772658.html |title=WikiLeaks' Iraq War Logs: US Troops Abused Prisoners For Years After Abu Ghraib |work=Huffington Post |access-date=April 3, 2012 |first=Marcus |last=Baram |date=October 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910182334/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/22/wikileaks-iraq-war-logs-i_n_772658.html |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2013, Associated Press stated that Engility Holdings, of [[Chantilly, Virginia]], paid $5.28 million in a settlement to 71 former inmates held at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run detention sites between 2003 and 2007. The settlement was the first successful attempt by the detainees to obtain reparations for the abuses they had experienced.<ref>{{cite news|title=$5M PAID IRAQIS OVER ABU GHRAIB ABUSE|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/apnewsbreak-5m-paid-iraqis-over-abu-ghraib-abuse|agency=Associated Press|access-date=January 8, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111231504/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/apnewsbreak-5m-paid-iraqis-over-abu-ghraib-abuse|archive-date=January 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Popular culture==
*The EP ''[[American Beauty (EP)|American Beauty]]'' was described by [[Bruce Springsteen]] (a singer and musician) as "...a metaphor for the house of horrors our government's actions created in the years following the invasion of Iraq. At its center is the repressed sexuality and abuse of power that characterized Abu Ghraib prison. I feel this is a shadow we as a country have yet to emerge from."<ref>{{cite web |author=The Official Bruce Springsteen Website |url=http://brucespringsteen.net/news/2014/american-beauty-celebrates-record-store-day |title=American Beauty celebrates Record Store Day - The Official Bruce Springsteen Website |publisher=Brucespringsteen.net |date=April 19, 2014 |access-date=April 30, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423021641/http://brucespringsteen.net/news/2014/american-beauty-celebrates-record-store-day |archive-date=April 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

*The poetic sequence, "abu ghraib arias," by [[Philip Metres]], was first published as a [[chapbook]], then included in the collection ''[[Sand Opera]]'' (Alice James Books, 2015).
*The cover of the 2013 album ''[[Virgins (album)|Virgins]]'' released by [[Tim Hecker]] features a figure bearing a pose similar to that of [[commons:File:AbuGhraibAbuse-standing-on-box.jpg|an Abu Ghraib detainee with a bag over his head.]]
*The film ''[[Children of Men]]'' contains allusions to images from Abu Ghraib. In a sequence where a bus enters a refugee camp, many prisoners are shown in positions similar to imagery of the prisoners in Abu Ghraib, including a recreation of the infamous photo of Abdou Hussain Saad Faleh.
