<!-- Do not add "Sir", see above -->'''Edward Moore Kennedy'''<!-- Do not add "KBE", see above --> (February 22, 1932 – August 25, 2009) was an American politician and lawyer who served as a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]] for almost 47 years, from 1962 until his death in 2009. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Kennedy family|Kennedy political family]], he was the [[List of United States Senators in the 111th Congress by seniority|second most senior]] member of the Senate when he died and is the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service#Senate time|fourth-longest-continuously-serving senator]] in United States history. Kennedy was the younger brother of President [[John F. Kennedy]] and U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and was the father of [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Patrick J. Kennedy]].

After attending [[Harvard University]] and receiving his law degree from the [[University of Virginia]], he began his career as an assistant district attorney in [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts]]. Kennedy was 30 years old when he first entered the Senate following a [[1962 United States Senate special election in Massachusetts|November 1962 special election in Massachusetts]] to fill the vacant seat previously held by his brother John, who had taken office as the president. He was [[1964 United States Senate election in Massachusetts|elected to a full six-year term in 1964]] and was later re-elected seven more times. The [[Chappaquiddick incident]] in 1969 resulted in the death of his automobile passenger, [[Mary Jo Kopechne]], as well as physical injuries and mental anguish to Kennedy. He pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and later received a two-month [[suspended sentence]]. The incident and its aftermath hindered his chances of ever becoming president. His only attempt, in the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 election]], resulted in a [[1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic primary campaign]] loss to the incumbent president, [[Jimmy Carter]].

Kennedy was known for his [[Public speaking|oratorical skills]]. His 1968 eulogy for his brother Robert and his [[The Dream Shall Never Die|1980 rallying cry]] for [[modern American liberalism]] were among his best-known speeches. He became recognized as "The Lion of the Senate" through his long tenure and influence. Kennedy and his staff wrote more than 300 bills that were enacted into law. Unabashedly liberal, Kennedy championed an interventionist government that emphasized [[economic justice|economic]] and [[social justice]], but he was also known for working with Republicans to find compromises. Kennedy played a major role in passing many laws, including the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], the [[National Cancer Act of 1971]], the [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA health insurance provision]], the [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986]], the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]], the [[Ryan White AIDS Care Act]], the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]], the [[Mental Health Parity Act]], the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|S-CHIP children's health program]], the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], and the [[Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act]]. During the 2000s, he led several unsuccessful [[immigration reform]] efforts. Over the course of his Senate career, Kennedy made efforts to enact [[universal health care]], which he called the "cause of my life." By the later years of his life, Kennedy had come to be viewed as a major figure and spokesman for [[American progressivism]].

He died on August 25, 2009, of a [[malignant]] [[brain tumor]] at his home in [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]], and was buried near his brothers John and Robert at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

==Early life==
Edward Moore Kennedy was born on February 22, 1932, at St. Margaret's Hospital in the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] section of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].<ref name="bg-series-1"/> He was the last of the nine children of [[Joseph P.

John asked to be the newborn's godfather, a request his parents honored, though they did not agree to his request to name the baby George Washington Kennedy (Ted was born on President [[George Washington]]'s 200th birthday) and instead named him after their father's assistant.<ref name="bg-obit">{{cite news| title=Kennedy dead at 77 |url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/08/26/kennedy_dead_at_77/ | last=Nolan| first=Martin F.| authorlink=Martin Nolan| newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=August 26, 2009 | accessdate=August 26, 2009}}</ref>

As a child, Ted was frequently uprooted by his family's moves among [[Bronxville, New York]]; [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]]; [[Palm Beach, Florida]]; and the [[Court of St. James's]], in London, England.{{sfn|Clymer|1999|pp=13, 16–17}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bronxville.dailyvoice.com/lifestyle/looking-back-on-jfks-time-in-bronxville/512600/|title=Looking Back on JFK's Time in Bronxville|last=Failla|first=Zak|date=November 18, 2013|work=[[The Daily Voice (U.S. hyperlocal news)|The Daily Voice]]|access-date=August 14, 2017}}</ref> His formal education started at Gibbs School in Kensington, London.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Edward M.|title=True Compass: A Memoir |date=2011 |publisher=Hachette|location=London, England|isbn=9780748123353|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jASECQl2P0C&pg=PT42|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref> He had attended ten schools by the age of eleven; this was a series of disruptions that interfered with his academic success.{{sfn|Burns|1976|pp=36, 38–39, 352n}} He was an [[altar boy]] at the [[Church of St. Joseph (Bronxville, New York)|St. Joseph's Church]] and was seven when he received his [[First Communion]] from [[Pope Pius XII]] in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]].{{sfn|Clymer|1999|p=11}} He spent sixth and seventh grades at the [[Fessenden School]], where he was a mediocre student,<ref name="bg-series-1"/> and eighth grade at Cranwell Preparatory School; both schools located in [[Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Clymer|1999|pp=13, 16–17}} He was the youngest child and his parents were affectionate towards him, but they also compared him unfavorably with his older brothers.<ref name="bg-series-1"/>

In June 1951, Kennedy enlisted in the [[United States Army]] and signed up for an optional four-year term that was shortened to the minimum of two years after his father intervened.{{sfn|Clymer|1999|pp=18–19}} Following [[United States Army Basic Training|basic training]] at [[Fort Dix]] in [[New Jersey]], he requested assignment to [[Fort Holabird]] in [[Maryland]] for [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]] training, but was dropped without explanation after a few weeks.{{sfn|Clymer|1999|pp=18–19}} He went to [[Camp Gordon]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for training in the [[Military Police Corps (United States Army)|Military Police Corps]].{{sfn|Clymer|1999|pp=18–19}} In June 1952, Kennedy was assigned to the [[Guard of honour|honor guard]] at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] headquarters in Paris, France.<ref name="bg-series-1"/>{{sfn|Clymer|1999|pp=18–19}} His father's political connections ensured that he was not deployed to the ongoing [[Korean War]].<ref name="bg-series-1"/>{{sfn|McGinnis|1993|p=198}} While stationed in Europe, he traveled extensively on weekends and climbed the [[Matterhorn]] in the [[Pennine Alps]].<ref name="kennedyism"/> After 21 months,  he was discharged in March 1953 as a [[Private first class#United States Army|private first class]].{{sfn|Clymer|1999|pp=18–19}}<ref name="kennedyism"/>

===Chappaquiddick incident===
{{Main|Chappaquiddick incident}}
On the night of July 18, 1969, Kennedy was at [[Chappaquiddick Island]] on the eastern end of [[Martha's Vineyard]]. He was hosting a party for the [[Boiler Room Girls]], a group of young women who had worked on his brother Robert's ill-fated 1968 presidential campaign.<ref name="bg-series-3"/> Kennedy left the party with one of the women, 28-year-old [[Mary Jo Kopechne]].

Driving a [[Oldsmobile Delmont 88#1965–68|1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88]], he attempted to cross the Dike Bridge, which did not have a guardrail at that time. Kennedy lost control of his vehicle and crashed in the [[Poucha Pond]] inlet, which was a tidal channel on Chappaquiddick Island. Kennedy escaped from the overturned vehicle, and, by his description, dove below the surface seven or eight times, vainly attempting to reach and rescue Kopechne. Ultimately, he swam to shore and left the scene, with Kopechne still trapped inside the vehicle. Kennedy did not report the accident to authorities until the next morning, by which time Kopechne's body had already been discovered.<ref name="bg-series-3"/> Kennedy's cousin [[Joseph Gargan|Joe Gargan]] later said that both he and Kennedy's friend [[Paul Markham]], both of whom were at the party and came to the scene, had urged Kennedy to report it at the time.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ronald|last=Kessler|title=The Sins of the Father: Joseph P.

A week after the incident, Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and was given a [[suspended sentence|suspended]] sentence of two months in jail.<ref name="bg-series-3"/> That night, he gave a national broadcast in which he said, "I regard as indefensible the fact that I did not report the accident to the police immediately," but he denied driving under the influence of alcohol and also denied any immoral conduct between him and Kopechne.<ref name="bg-series-3"/> Kennedy asked the Massachusetts electorate whether he should stay in office or resign; after getting a favorable response in messages sent to him, Kennedy announced on July 30 that he would remain in the Senate and run for re-election the next year.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4AwwAAAAIBAJ&pg=6648,3488972 | title=Kennedy Stays in Senate; Will Seek New Term | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[Toledo Blade|The Blade]] | location=Toledo | date=July 31, 1969 | page=1}}</ref>

On [[Easter weekend]] 1991, Kennedy was at a get-together at the family's [[Palm Beach, Florida]], estate. After reminiscing about his brother-in-law, Kennedy was restless and maudlin when he left for a late-night visit to a local bar. He got his son [[Patrick J.

Bork and [[Clarence Thomas]] were the two most contentious Supreme Court nominations in United States history.{{sfn|Barone|Cohen|2008|p=364}} When the [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Thomas hearings]] began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about ''[[Roe v.

Biographer [[Adam Clymer]] rated Kennedy's silence during the Thomas hearings as the worst moment of his Senate career.{{sfn|Clymer|1999|pp=493–499}} Writer [[Anna Quindlen]] said "[Kennedy] let us down because he had to; he was muzzled by the facts of his life".{{sfn|Clymer|1999|pp=493–499}} On the day before the full Senate vote, Kennedy gave an impassioned speech against Thomas, declaring that the treatment of Hill had been "shameful" and that "[t]o give the benefit of the doubt to Judge Thomas is to say that Judge Thomas is more important than the Supreme Court."<ref>{{cite news | author=Welch, William | title='Benefit of the Doubt' – Key Senators Give Thomas Support for Confirmation | newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] | date=October 15, 1991 | url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19911015&slug=1311090}}</ref> He then voted against the nomination.{{sfn|Clymer|1999|pp=493–499}} Thomas was confirmed by a 52–48 vote, one of the narrowest margins ever for a successful nomination.{{sfn|Clymer|1999|pp=493–499}}

Due to the Palm Beach media attention and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered.

[It] involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings&nbsp;– the faults in the conduct of my private life.
