In October 2014, European Union leaders agreed to appoint Stylianides as the bloc's point person on the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]], as it sought to step up its response to the spread of the virus.<ref>Naftali Bendavid (October 23, 2014), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-appoints-ebola-response-coordinator-1414100467 EU Appoints Ebola Response Coordinator] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> He later impressed many lawmakers at his parliamentary hearing as nominee for the post of [[European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection|European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management]] in the [[Juncker Commission]].<ref>Alastair Macdonald (October 2, 2014), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/02/uk-eu-commission-penpix-idUKKCN0HR2BO20141002 EU Commission nominees face further hearings] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

== Life after politics ==
Since July 2020, Stylianides has been serving as a special advisor on education in emergencies, migration and inclusion to [[Vice-President of the European Commission]] [[Margaritis Schinas]].<ref>[https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-commission/service-standards-and-principles/transparency/special-advisers_en Non-institutional special advisers] [[European Commission]].</ref>

==Political positions==
Considered a "hardcore Europeanist", Stylianides advocated Cyprus's accession to the [[European Union]] as far back as the mid-1990s, when he co-founded the Movement for Political Modernisation and Reform, despite the initial scepticism of many on the political scene.<ref>Helena Smith (October 30, 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/christos-stylianides-crisis-commissioner/ Christos Stylianides – crisis commissioner] ''[[Politico Europe|European Voice]]''.</ref>

Although Stylianides is widely regarded a liberal by inclination, his political career has always been with the centre-right Democratic Rally party, DISY, on the grounds that it takes a more conciliatory approach to reuniting Cyprus. He supported the controversial United Nations-brokered blueprint for Cyprus known as the [[Annan plan]], which called for an end to the island's division and for reunification of its two feuding communities in a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation – in a referendum in 2004, the plan was accepted by a majority of Turkish Cypriots but overwhelmingly rejected by Stylianides's fellow Greeks Cypriots.<ref>Helena Smith (October 30, 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/christos-stylianides-crisis-commissioner/ Christos Stylianides – crisis commissioner] ''[[Politico Europe|European Voice]]''.</ref>
