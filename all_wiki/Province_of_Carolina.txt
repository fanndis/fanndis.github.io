Although the division between the northern and southern governments became complete in 1712, both colonies remained in the hands of the same group of proprietors. A rebellion against the proprietors broke out in 1719 which led to the appointment of a [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|royal governor]] for South Carolina in 1720. After nearly a decade in which the British government sought to locate and buy out the proprietors, both [[Province of North Carolina|North]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]] became [[crown colony|royal colonies]] in 1729.

===1629 Charter===
On October 30, 1629, King [[Charles I of England]] granted a patent to Sir [[Robert Heath]] for the lands south of [[36th parallel north|36 degrees]] and north of [[31st parallel north|31 degrees]], "under the name, in honor of that king, of [[Carolana]]."<ref name="cummings1998">{{Cite book |last=Cummings |first=William |title=The Southeast in Early Maps, Third Edition |date=1998 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn=0807823716 |location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina |page=14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=N.

Heath wanted the land for French [[Huguenots]], but when Charles restricted use of the land to members of the [[Church of England]], Heath assigned his grant to George, Lord Berkeley.<ref>{{Cite web |title=NHC Public Library – New Hanover County – North Carolina |url=http://www.nhcgov.com/Library/Documents/History+of+the+Lower+Cape+Fear.pdf |website=New Hanover County}}</ref> King Charles I was executed in 1649 and Heath fled to France where he died. Following the 1660 [[English Restoration|restoration of the monarchy]], Heath's heirs attempted to reassert their claim to the land, but [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] ruled the claim invalid.

===1663 Charter===
[[File:Carolina Vintage Map.JPG|thumb|left|"A New Description of Carolina", engraved by Francis Lamb (London, Tho. Basset and Richard Chiswell, 1676)]]
On March 24, 1663, Charles II issued a new charter to a group of eight English noblemen, granting them the land of Carolina, as a reward for their faithful support of his efforts to regain the throne of England. The eight were called ''Lords Proprietors'' or simply ''Proprietors''. The 1663 charter granted the Lords Proprietor title to all of the land from the southern border of the [[Virginia Colony]] at [[36th parallel north|36 degrees north]] to [[31st parallel north|31 degrees north]] (along the coast of present-day [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]).<ref name=charter2/>

In 1665, the charter was revised slightly (see [[Royal Colonial Boundary of 1665]]), with the northerly boundary extended to [[Parallel 36°30' north|36 degrees 30 minutes north]] to include the lands of settlers along the [[Albemarle Sound]] who had left the [[Virginia Colony]]. Likewise, the southern boundary was moved south to [[29th parallel north|29 degrees north]], just south of present-day [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], which had the effect of including the existing [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] settlement at [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. The charter also granted all the land, between these northerly and southerly bounds, from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], westward to the shores of the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name="Avalon2008" />

The Lords Proprietors named in the charter were [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]]; [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle]]; [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven, 1st Baron Craven|William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven]]; [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton]]; [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]]; Sir [[George Carteret]]; Sir [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]] (brother of John); and Sir [[John Colleton]]. Of the eight, the one who demonstrated the most active interest in Carolina was Lord Shaftesbury. Shaftesbury, with the assistance of his secretary, the philosopher [[John Locke]], drafted the [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina]] (which included the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]]), a plan for government of the colony heavily influenced by the ideas of the English political scientist, [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]]. Some of the other Lords Proprietors also had interests in other colonies: for instance, John Berkeley and George Carteret held stakes in the [[Province of New Jersey]], and William Berkeley had an interest in [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]].

The Lords Proprietors, operating under their royal charter, were able to exercise their authority with nearly the independence of the king himself. The actual government consisted of a governor, a powerful council, on which half of the councillors were appointed by the Lords Proprietors themselves, and a relatively weak, popularly elected assembly.

Within three generations of Columbus, the Spanish from their Florida base had started to emigrate up the coast of modern North Carolina. A hostile Virginia tribe drove them back to Georgia.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  A Scottish contingent had meanwhile settled in South Carolina only to be extirpated by the Spanish, who inhabited [[Parris Island]], SC, as late as 1655. The Spanish were again beaten back to Georgia.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Crane |first=Vernon |title=The Southern Frontier 1670–1732 |publisher=University of North Carolina |year=1928}}</ref>

Although the [[Lost Colony]] on [[Roanoke Island]] was the first English attempt at settlement in the Carolina territory, the first permanent English settlement was not established until 1653, when emigrants from the [[Virginia Colony]], with others from [[New England]] and [[Bermuda]], settled at the mouths of the [[Chowan River|Chowan]] and [[Roanoke River]]s, on the shores of [[Albemarle Sound]], in the northeastern corner of present-day [[North Carolina]]. The [[Albemarle Settlements]], preceding the royal charter by ten years, came to be known in Virginia as "Rogues' Harbor".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Part IV, Chapter 42 |url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/marshall/country/country-IV-42.html |access-date=2012-07-31 |publisher=Digital.library.upenn.edu}}</ref> By 1664, the region was organized as [[Albemarle County, North Carolina|Albemarle County]].

In 1663, Captain William Hilton had noted the presence of a wooden cross erected by the Spaniards that still stood before the town meeting house of the Indians living at what later became [[Port Royal, South Carolina|Port Royal]].<ref name="Crane1928">{{Cite book |last=Verner Crane |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4voBZqHuCIUC&pg=PA6 |title=The Southern Frontier 1670–1732 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |year=1928 |isbn=978-0-8173-5082-6 |page=6}}</ref> In 1665, Sir [[John Yeamans]] established a second short-lived English settlement on the [[Cape Fear River]], near present-day [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], which he named Clarendon.

The Lords Proprietors founded a sturdier new settlement when they sent 150 colonists to the province in early 1670, landing them at a location south of the other settlements, near present-day [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. In 1669, [[William Sayle]] of Bermuda had taken over the command of the party of settlers gathered in Bermuda after Sir [[John Yeamans]] resigned while undergoing repairs of his vessel in Bermuda. Most of the party was made up of emigrants from England who had arrived in Bermuda enroute to the establishment of the settlement in the Carolinas. Sayle arrived in Carolina aboard a [[Bermuda sloop]] with a number of Bermudian families to found the town of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. In 1670, William Sayle, then in his eighties, became the first [[List of colonial governors of South Carolina|Colonial Governor of the colony of Carolina]].<ref>''The Exodus'', by Michael Jarvis, in The Bermudian magazine, June 2001.</ref><ref>''In the Eye of All Trade'', by Michael Jarvis. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press (2010). {{ISBN|9780807872840}}.</ref> Many of the other colonists were planters from [[Barbados]]. The "[[History of Charleston, South Carolina|Charles Town]]" settlement, as it was known then, developed more rapidly than the Albemarle and Cape Fear settlements due to the advantages of a natural harbor and expanding trade with the [[West Indies]]. Charles Town was made the principal seat of government for the entire province; Lord Shaftesbury specified its street plan. The nearby [[Ashley River (South Carolina)|Ashley]] and [[Cooper River (South Carolina)|Cooper river]]s are named for him.

Due to their remoteness from each other, the northern and southern sections of the colony operated more or less independently until 1691, when [[Philip Ludwell]] was appointed governor of the entire province. From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. The north continued to have its own assembly and council; the governor resided in Charles Towne and appointed a deputy-governor for the north. During this period, the two-halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina.

Carolina was the first of three colonies in North America settled by the English to have a comprehensive plan. Known as the [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina|Grand Model]], or Grand Modell, it was composed of a constitution and detailed guidelines for settlement and development. The constitution, titled [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]], was drafted by the philosopher John Locke under the direction of Anthony Ashley Cooper (later made [[Earl of Shaftesbury]]).<ref>Wilson, Thomas D. ''The Ashley Cooper Plan: The Founding of Carolina and the Origins of Southern Political Culture.'' Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2016. Chapter 1.</ref>

===Dissent===
From 1708 to 1710, due to disquiet over attempts to establish the Anglican church in the province, the people were unable to agree on a slate of elected officials; consequently, there was no recognized and legal government for more than two years, a period which culminated in [[Cary's Rebellion]] when the Lords Proprietors finally commissioned a new governor. This circumstance, coupled with the [[Tuscarora War]] and the [[Yamasee War]], and the inability of the Lords Proprietors to act decisively, led to separate governments for North and South Carolina.

Some take this period as the establishment of separate colonies, but that did not officially occur until 1729 when seven of the Lords Proprietors sold their interests in Carolina to [[the Crown]], and both North Carolina and South Carolina became royal colonies. The eighth share was Sir George Carteret's, which had passed to his great-grandson [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville]]. He retained ownership of a sixty-mile-wide strip of land in North Carolina adjoining the Virginia boundary, which became known as the [[Granville District]]. This district was to become the scene of many disputes, from 1729 until the [[American Revolutionary War]], at which time it was seized by the North Carolina revolutionary government.

Governments under proprietary rule and under crown rule were similarly organized. The primary difference was who was to appoint the governing officials: the Lords Proprietors or the Sovereign.

===Georgia===
In 1732, a corporate charter for the [[Province of Georgia]] was carved out of South Carolina by King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]].
