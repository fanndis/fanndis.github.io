'''Harriet Ruth Harman''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|QC|MP}} (born 30 July 1950) is a British politician and solicitor who has served as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for  [[Camberwell and Peckham (UK Parliament constituency)|Camberwell and Peckham]], formerly [[Peckham (UK Parliament constituency)|Peckham]], since [[1982 Peckham by-election|1982]]. A member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], she has served in various [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] and [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] positions.

Born in London to a doctor and a barrister, Harman was privately educated at [[St Paul's Girls' School]] before going on to study Politics at the [[University of York]]. After working for [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]] [[Law Centre]], she became a legal officer for the [[Liberty (advocacy group)|National Council for Civil Liberties]], a role in which she was found in [[contempt of court]] following action pursued by [[Michael Havers, Baron Havers|Michael Havers]], a former [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]]. She successfully took a case, ''Harman v United Kingdom'', to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] which found Havers had breached her right to freedom of expression.

Harman was elected as MP for [[Peckham (UK Parliament constituency)|Peckham]] at a [[1982 Peckham by-election|1982 by-election]]. She was made a shadow social services minister in 1984 and a shadow health minister in 1987. Under [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], she served as [[Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] and, under [[Tony Blair]], as [[Secretary of State for Employment|Shadow Employment Secretary]], [[Shadow Health Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Shadow Social Security Secretary]] respectively. Following the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election victory]], she was appointed [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Secretary of State for Social Security]] and the first ever [[Minister for Women and Equalities|Minister for Women]], serving until 1998 when she left the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. In 2001, she was appointed [[Solicitor General for England and Wales]], serving until 2005 when she became [[Department for Constitutional Affairs|Minister of State for Constitutional Affairs]]. She ran in the [[2007 Labour Party deputy leadership election|2007 deputy leadership election]] and defeated five other candidates, ultimately defeating [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Alan Johnson]], by 50.43% to 49.56%. [[Gordon Brown]], who was [[2007 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|elected as party leader]], appointed her [[Leader of the House of Commons]], [[Lord Privy Seal]], [[Minister for Women and Equalities|Minister for Women and Equality]] and [[Chairman of the Labour Party (UK)|Chairman of the Labour Party]], although she was not appointed Deputy Prime Minister.

Upon defeat at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Brown resigned as party leader and Harman, as [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]], became [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Acting Leader]] of the Labour Party and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] until [[Ed Miliband]] was [[2010 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|elected leader]]. She subsequently served as [[Shadow Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Shadow Deputy Prime Minister]], combining the position with that of [[Shadow Secretary of State for International Development]] (2010–2011) and then [[Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]] (2011–2015). After Labour's defeat at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], Miliband resigned as Leader of the Labour Party and Harman once again became Acting Leader and Leader of the Opposition. She announced that she would also resign as Deputy Leader, prompting a concurrent [[2015 Labour Party deputy leadership election|deputy leadership election]].

Harman gained a [[British undergraduate degree classification|2:1]] BA in Politics from the [[University of York]]. During her time at York, she was a member of [[Goodricke College, York|Goodricke College]] and was involved with student politics. After York, Harman went on to qualify as a solicitor and worked for Brent [[Law Centre]] in London. Between 1978 and 1982, she was employed as a legal officer for the [[Liberty (pressure group)|National Council for Civil Liberties]]. In this capacity, and just before becoming MP for Peckham in a by-election in 1982, she represented a prisoner who was kept in solitary confinement against the [[Home Office]]. However, she was found in [[contempt of court]] for sharing documents she had read aloud in the courtroom with a journalist. The contempt of court action was pursued by [[Michael Havers, Baron Havers|Michael Havers]], a former [[Attorney General for England and Wales]].<ref>See ''Harman v The Home Office'' (the conviction for contempt being upheld on appeal) [1983] 1 AC 280, 308; {{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19890857/Home-Office-v-Harman-1983-1-AC-280-HL |title=<nowiki>Home Office v.

Harman was later involved in a [[European Court of Human Rights]] case against [[MI5]].

==Opposition Member of Parliament==
[[Harry Lamborn]], the Labour MP for [[Peckham (UK Parliament constituency)|Peckham]], died on 21 August 1982. In the subsequent [[1982 Peckham by-election|by-election]] held on 28 October 1982, Harman was elected to succeed Lamborn with 11,349 votes (50.34%), a majority of 3,931 over [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic]] candidate [[Dick Taverne]], a former Labour MP for [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate was [[John Redwood]], who came third, and went on to be elected MP for [[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wokingham]] in 1987.

In 1984, Harman became a Shadow Social Services minister and served as a Shadow Health minister in 1987. After the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] she entered the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] as [[Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] (1992–1994) and later served as [[Secretary of State for Employment|Shadow Employment Secretary]] (1994–1995), [[Shadow Health Secretary]] (1995–1996) and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Shadow Social Security Secretary]] (1996–1997).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/background/frontbench/socsec.shtml|title=Social Security Secretary; Minister for Women – Harriet Harman|work=BBC Political Research Unit|publisher=[[BBC]]|year=1997|accessdate=30 September 2008}}</ref>

==Labour in Government==

===Under Tony Blair===
After Labour's victory in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], she became [[Secretary of State for Social Security]] and the first ever [[Minister for Women and Equalities|Minister for Women]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6918188.stm |title=Harman made equalities secretary |work=[[BBC News]] | date=26 July 2007 |access-date=5 January 2010}}</ref> She was given the task of reforming the Welfare State. During this time, her more notable policies included introducing a minimum income guarantee and winter fuel payments for the elderly. It was later ruled that the fuel payments policy breached European [[sex discrimination]] laws in that men had to wait five years longer to receive them than women.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/567208.stm |title=Winter fuel payments 'sexist' |work=BBC News |date=16 December 1999 |accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref> The policy was amended so both sexes qualified at age 60.

According to many in the media, this was the result of a series of public rows with junior minister [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]], though others also cited her decision to cut benefits to lone parents as a factor.<ref name="timesonline.co.uk">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5780320.ece Profile: Harriet Harman] ''The Times'', 22 February 2009</ref> Harman voted with the party on all but a few instances during its period in government.

Harman made a return to the front bench after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], with her appointment to the office of [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]], thus becoming the first female Solicitor General. In accordance with convention, she was appointed as [[Queen's Counsel]], although she had previously had no rights of audience in the higher courts, did not obtain them and never presented a case during her time as Solicitor General, or at all.

After the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], she became a Minister of State in the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]] with responsibilities including constitutional reform, legal aid and court processes and she represented [[Charlie Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Falconer]] in the House of Commons on the frontbench.

On 16 March 2006, Harman relinquished her ministerial responsibilities for electoral administration and reform of the [[House of Lords]]. She stated that this was to avoid any potential conflict of interest after her husband [[Jack Dromey]], the Treasurer of the Labour Party, announced that he would be investigating a number of [[2006–2007 Life Peerages scandal|loans made to the Labour Party]] that had not been disclosed to party officers. She retained her other responsibilities.<ref>{{cite news | title=Harman gives up Lords reform role | date=16 March 2006 | work =BBC News| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4812666.stm | accessdate = 25 June 2007 }}</ref>

====Campaign donations====
{{Main|Labour party proxy and undeclared donations (2007)}}
In November 2007, it emerged that [[property developer]] [[David Abrahams (Labour party donor)|David Abrahams']] secretary Janet Kidd had donated £5,000 to Harman's successful deputy leadership bid. After an investigation by ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' newspaper into other donations made by people associated with Abrahams, and Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]]'s assertion that all such monies would be returned, Harman issued a statement saying she accepted the donation on 4 July "in good faith," had registered the monies with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] and the Register of Members' Interests, and that she "was not aware of any funding arrangements... between David Abrahams and Janet Kidd".<ref name="BBCN3">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7115016.stm |title=Harman took cash 'in good faith' |work=BBC News |date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2007}}</ref>

Brown must ditch his pride|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate= 18 December 2009 | location=London | first=Jackie | last=Ashley | date=9 March 2009}}</ref> On 28 June 2007, after she became Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and Brown was appointed Prime Minister, Harman joined [[Brown Ministry|Brown's Cabinet]] as [[Leader of the House of Commons]], [[Lord Privy Seal]] and [[Minister for Women and Equality]], and was also [[Chairman of the Labour Party (UK)|Chairman of the Labour Party]]. Unlike the previous Deputy Leader, [[John Prescott]], Harman was not made [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].

When Harman, as Leader of the House of Commons, stood in for Gordon Brown during [[Prime Minister's Questions|Prime minister's questions]] on Wednesday 2 April 2008 (due to the Prime Minister attending a [[NATO]] summit in [[Romania]]), she became the first female Labour Minister to take Prime Minister's Questions. She subsequently repeated this during Brown's absences.

Harman attacked the Conservative Party at the [[Labour Party Conference]] 2007, referring to them as the "nasty party" and suggesting that there would be little competition at the next election.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7016326.stm|title=Tories still nasty, says Harman|work=BBC News| date=27 September 2007 | accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref>

On 1 April 2008 the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that Harman had decided to wear a [[kevlar]]-reinforced [[stab vest]] while touring her [[Peckham]] constituency under police guard. On 2 April ''[[The Guardian]]'' relayed information from the [[Metropolitan Police]] that "the type of Met Vest she wore over her jacket protected her from knife attacks and bullets, and, for her at least, was optional".<ref name="GHHSP">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/apr/02/harrietharman |title=Armour furore leaves Harman wounded |first=Helen |last=Pidd |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2 April 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2008 |location=London}}</ref> Harman compared the decision to wearing a [[hard hat]] while touring a building site, which led the BBC's [[John Humphrys]] to respond, during an interview for [[BBC Radio 4]], "You wear a hard hat on a building site because... there is the danger that something might drop on your head. You don't need to wear a bullet-proof vest on the streets of London, do you!" Harman told the BBC that the neighbourhood police team she was with put on their stab vests and gave her one to wear as well.<ref name="BBCN4">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7324123.stm |title=Harman defends wearing stab vest |work=BBC News|date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=1 April 2008 }}</ref>

In April 2008, Harman's blog was hacked and changed to state that she had joined the Conservative Party. Harman later admitted when questioned by ''Sky News'' that the incident was a result of her using "Harriet" and "Harman" as her username and password.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/25/harriet_harman_website_hacked/|date=25 April 2008|work=The Register|title=Harman hack horror has blog backing Boris}}</ref> The hacker was Conservative [[Kemi Badenoch]], who was elected as MP for [[Saffron Walden (UK Parliament constituency)|Saffron Walden]] in 2017. Badenoch confessed to the hacking in an April 2018 interview with ''Core Politics'' and later offered Harman an apology, which she accepted.<ref>{{cite news|last=Levesley|first=David|date=8 April 2018|title=Kemi Badenoch admits she hacked a Labour MP's website to 'say nice things about the Tories'|work=i News|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/kemi-badenoch-admits-she-hacked-a-labour-mps-website-to-say-nice-things-about-the-tories/|url-status=live|accessdate=8 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408194157/https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/kemi-badenoch-admits-she-hacked-a-labour-mps-website-to-say-nice-things-about-the-tories/|archive-date=8 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=8 April 2018|title=Tory rising star apologises after admitting she 'hacked into Labour MP's website'|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/04/08/tory-rising-star-apologises-admitting-shehacked-labour-mps-website/|url-status=live|accessdate=8 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408112546/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/04/08/tory-rising-star-apologises-admitting-shehacked-labour-mps-website/|archive-date=8 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Heffer|first=Greg|date=8 April 2018|title=Tory vice-chair Kemi Badenoch admits hacking Labour MP's website|publisher=Sky News|url=https://news.sky.com/story/tory-vice-chair-kemi-badenoch-admits-hacking-labour-mps-website-11323056|url-status=live|accessdate=8 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408184323/https://news.sky.com/story/tory-vice-chair-kemi-badenoch-admits-hacking-labour-mps-website-11323056|archive-date=8 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Khomami|first=Nadia|date=9 April 2018|title=Harriet Harman accepts Tory rising star's hacking apology|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/09/harriet-harman-accepts-tory-rising-star-kemi-badenoch-hacking-apology|url-status=live|accessdate=9 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409104710/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/09/harriet-harman-accepts-tory-rising-star-kemi-badenoch-hacking-apology|archive-date=9 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Use of statistics===
During the [[Great Recession|late-2000s recession]], and following a government report which suggested that women were twice as likely to lose their jobs as men and feared losing their jobs more than men, Harman stated: "We will not allow women to become the victims of this recession".<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5581549.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&attr=2015164 Women losing jobs twice as fast as men] ''The Times'', 25 January 2009</ref> However, some statistics contradicted her position, including the Office for National Statistics report on the issue which stated "the economic downturn in 2008 has impacted less on women in employment than men". According to the ONS, men were losing their jobs at twice the rate of women. The Government Equalities Office insisted the ONS figures did not render pointless its efforts to help women.<ref>{{cite news |last=Beckford |first=Martin |date=7 March 2009 |title=Office for National Statistics contradicts Government again with female employment figures |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/4949315/Office-for-National-Statistics-contradicts-Government-again-with-female-employment-figures.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=2145 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140847/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=2145 |archive-date=29 June 2011 |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |title=Women in the Labour Market |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref>

In June 2009, [[Michael Scholar|Sir Michael Scholar]], head of the [[UK Statistics Authority]], wrote to Harman to warn her that different headline figures used by the ONS and Government Equalities Office with regards to pay differentiation between men and women might undermine public trust in official statistics. The GEO's headline figure was 23%, which was based on median hourly earnings of all employees, not the 12.8%, based on median hourly earnings of full-time employees only, used by the ONS. Scholar wrote: "It is the Statistics Authority’s view that use of the 23% on its own, without qualification, risks giving a misleading quantification of the gender pay gap".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/letter-from-sir-michael-scholar-to-harriet-harman-qc-mp-11-june-2009-and-m-a-note.pdf |title=Chair of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir Michael Scholar KCB |accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8096761.stm | work=BBC News | title=Harman pay gap data 'misleading' | date=12 June 2009}}</ref>

===Expenses===
{{Main|United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal}}
[[File:Harriet Harman, January 2009 2.jpg|thumb|Harman in 2009]]
In January 2009, Harman proposed a rule change to exempt MPs' expenses from the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]]. Her parliamentary order aimed to remove "most expenditure information held by either House of Parliament from the scope of the Freedom of Information Act". It meant that, under the law, journalists and members of the public would no longer be entitled to learn details of their MP's expenses. Labour MPs were to be pressured to vote for this measure by use of a [[three line whip]]. Her proposal was withdrawn when the Conservative Party said they would vote against, and in light of an online campaign by [[mySociety]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=42836 |title=FoI campaigners condemn MPs' bid to hide expenses |work=Press Gazette |date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518081436/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=42836 |archive-date=18 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The failure of the motion led to the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|disclosure of expenses of British members of parliament]].

In December 2010, it emerged that Harman was amongst 40 MPs who had secretly repaid wrongly claimed expenses between 2008 and 2010. In November 2010, Harman's parliamentary private secretary [[Ian Lavery]] had blocked a motion designed to allow the repayments to be made public.<ref>{{cite news |last=Beckford |first=Martin |date=9 December 2010 |title=MPs' expenses: 17 MPs were re-elected after secret deals on expenses |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/8192570/MPs-expenses-17-MPs-were-re-elected-after-secret-deals-on-expenses.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref>

===Equality Bill===
{{Main|Equality Act 2010}}
As part of a proposed [[Equality Bill]], Harman announced a consultation on changing the existing discrimination laws, including options for [[reverse discrimination]] in employment. Under the proposals, employers would be legally allowed to discriminate in favour of a job candidate on the basis of their race or gender where the candidates were otherwise equally qualified. Employers would not be required to use these powers, but would be able to do so without the threat of legal action for discriminatory practices. The white paper also proposed measures to end age discrimination, promote transparency in organisations and introduce a new equality duty on the public sector.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Harriet |last=Harman |title=Framework for a Fairer Future – The Equalities Bill |year=2008 |page=40 |place=London |publisher=HMSO |url= http://www.equalities.gov.uk/publications/FRAMEWORK%20FAIRER%20FUTURE.pdf}}</ref>

It was argued by critics that these changes could face a challenge under Article 14 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race, colour, language, religion and on several other criteria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm |title=Council of Europe – ETS no. 005 – Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref> Michael Millar, writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'', was of the opinion that "the Equality Bill before parliament today gives employers the right to choose an ethnic minority candidate or female candidate over a white male, specifically because they are an ethnic minority or female."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/798356/harriet-harman-unleashes-positive-discrimination.thtml |title=Harriet Harman unleashes positive discrimination |newspaper=The Spectator |accessdate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605062434/http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/798356/harriet-harman-unleashes-positive-discrimination.thtml |archive-date=5 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Harman also commissioned a report on allowing political parties to draw up all-black shortlists<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3341874.ece|title=Harriet Harman in plan to give parties all-black shortlists|work=The Times |location=London |first=Marie |last=Woolf |date=10 February 2008 |accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> designed to increase the number of black MPs in Westminster.

==Return to Opposition==
{{see also|First Shadow Cabinet of Harriet Harman|Second Shadow Cabinet of Harriet Harman}}
Following the resignation of [[Gordon Brown]] as Prime Minister and [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] on 11 May 2010, Harman automatically became the temporary leader of the party as well as the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], entitling her to the salary and government car that come with the role. Although she was informally described in the media as 'Acting' Leader, she was fully Leader by the terms of the party's constitution, albeit on a temporary basis, as was the case with [[Margaret Beckett]] in 1994.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.savethelabourparty.org/labourpartyrulebook2008.pdf|title=Labour Party Rule Book 2008|publisher=The Labour Party|quote=When the party is in opposition and the party leader, for whatever reason, becomes permanently unavailable, the deputy leader shall automatically become party leader on a pro-tem basis.|accessdate=12 May 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Following Brown's resignation, she quickly announced that she would remain Deputy Leader rather than standing for [[2010 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|election as Leader]]. Her only public explanation was the assertion that: "You can’t run for leader at the same time as being deputy leader".<ref>{{cite news|last=Prince |first=Rosa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/7713246/Harriet-Harman-is-acting-leader-of-the-Labour-Party.html |title=Harriet Harman is acting leader of the Labour Party |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 May 2010|accessdate=5 June 2010}}</ref>

She nominated [[Diane Abbott]], MP for [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney North and Stoke Newington]], to prevent the election from being all male. But she nonetheless asserted her intention to remain neutral throughout the contest and said, "This is a very crucial period and we have got five fantastic candidates.

This was greeted with cheers and laughter from the conference, but the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish National Party]] described them as [[gingerism]] and "anti-Scottish". Harman apologised for the offence caused. In 2011, Harman was moved to become [[Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]].

===Paedophile Information Exchange allegations and response===
In February 2014, Harman denied allegations that she had supported the [[Paedophile Information Exchange]] (PIE) when the advocacy group was affiliated with [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]], while she was the pressure group's Legal Officer from 1978 to 1982. Both the ''Daily Mail'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' also claimed that [[Jack Dromey]] MP (her partner) and former Health Secretary [[Patricia Hewitt]] had offered support to apologists for the sexual abuse of children while they were working for NCCL. ''The Guardian'' also states that in an NCCL briefing note dated 1978, Harman urged amendments to a 1978 Child Protection Bill declaring that "images of children should only be considered pornographic if it could be proven the subject suffered", which Harman says was an argument intended to protect from "unintended consequences" such as parents being prosecuted for taking pictures of their children on the beach or in the bath.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/26/lobbying-paedophile-campaign-revealed-hewitt|title=Lobbying by paedophile campaign revealed|last=Booth|first=Robert|date=26 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=31 March 2017|last2=Pidd|first2=Helen}}</ref>

As the holder of the record as longest-ever continuously serving female MP in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Harman was dubbed the "[[Father of the House|Mother of the House]]" by Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] on 13 June 2017.<ref>{{cite web|date=13 June 2017|title=Election of Speaker|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2017-06-13/debates/EC97CC8B-CEAB-4D1D-8AEE-12D83E9E0253/ElectionOfSpeaker|work=Hansard|publisher=Commons|location=UK}}</ref>

On 10 September 2019, Harman announced that she would stand to be the next [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] following the announcement by the current Speaker [[John Bercow]] of his intention to resign on 31 October 2019.<ref>{{cite news |title=Labour's Harriet Harman to run for Commons Speaker |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49646257 |accessdate=10 September 2019 |work=BBC News |date=10 September 2019}}</ref> She withdrew from the vote after the second ballot, having the lowest votes of all of the surviving candidates.
