==Biography==
Born Helen Grace Knewstub in [[Chelsea, London]], in 1907, one of six children, she was educated at the Convent of the Holy Child Jesus at [[Mark Cross, Rotherfield|Mark Cross]], [[Sussex]].<ref name=ODNB>Hera Cook, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-69189?rskey=wIxbNt&result=1 "Brook (née Knewstub), Helen Grace, Lady Brook"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.</ref> At the age of 17 she married George Whitaker, leader of the Chenil Chamber Orchestra, giving birth to a daughter the following year; the marriage was dissolved at her request after two years and she then spent two years in [[Paris]] as a painter. Having returned to London, in 1937 she married banker [[Robin Brook]] and they had two daughters.<ref name=Independent />

Helen Brook worked as a volunteer for the [[Family Planning Association]] (FPA). As [[Ann Furedi]] wrote in ''[[The Independent]]'', <blockquote>"Brook was motivated by fervent belief that children should be born to mothers who wanted them and could care for them. She also believed that women should enjoy equality with men and that to achieve this they needed to be able to avoid unwanted pregnancy....  In 1958, when [[Marie Stopes]] died, Brook was invited to run her independent clinic in [[Whitfield Street]] in London, and with the support of the clinic doctors and a nurse she began to run an evening session each week for the large numbers of unmarried women turned away from other clinics. In 1963, she began 'secret' sessions aimed specifically at young people.

When, at the end of that year, a storm of publicity broke, the Marie Stopes board suggested it would be expedient if she founded a separate centre. The opportunity was duly seized and the first of the Brook Advisory Centres exclusively for young, unmarried people opened its doors in London to women and men in 1964."<ref name=Independent /></blockquote>

On 16 February 1980, Brook wrote a letter to ''The Times'' in which she stated: 

<blockquote>"[T]here are countless men and women, parents, who are too selfish, too ignorant, too lazy to be bothered about their children's general education. From birth till death it is now the privilege of the parental State to take major decisions— objective, unemotional, the State weighs up what is best for the child."<ref>''The Times'', 16 February 1980.</ref></blockquote>

[[John Stokes (Conservative politician)|John Stokes]] described the letter in Parliament as "notorious" and "a terrifying doctrine, the end of which one dare not see."<ref>[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=1980-05-14a.1501.0#g1516.0 "Adjournment (Spring) – in the House of Commons at 12:00 am on 14th May 1980".]</ref>

Brook was vice-president of the national council of the FPA from 1987. In later life, she lost her sight, and she died as the result of a stroke on 3 October 1997, survived by her husband.<ref name=ODNB />
