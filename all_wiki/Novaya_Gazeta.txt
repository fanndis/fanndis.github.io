==History==
A group of former journalists from ''[[Komsomolskaya pravda]]'' organised the newspaper in 1993, its first name was ''Ezhednevnaya Novaya Gazeta'' (Daily New Gazette).<ref name="rbc_election">{{cite web |title=Главным редактором "Новой газеты" вновь избрали Дмитрия Муратова |url=https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/15/11/2019/5dce8fab9a7947c2d1c81745 |date=15 November 2019 |last1= Демченко |first1=Наталья |last2=Филипенок |first2= Артем |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115151022/https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/15/11/2019/5dce8fab9a7947c2d1c81745 |archive-date=15 November 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===International Industrial Bank investigation===
On 26 November 2001, ''Novaya Gazeta'' published an article by Oleg Lurie stating that the management of the [[International Industrial Bank]], headed by [[Sergey Pugachyov]], had been involved in money laundering in the [[Bank of New York]].<ref>{{cite news| author=Lourie, Oleg |url= http://2001.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2001/86n/n86n-s08.shtml |script-title=ru:Путин любит лыжи. Ну и при чем здесь Пугачев? |language=ru |date=26 November 2001 |work=Novaya Gazeta |accessdate=27 November 2009}}</ref> Pugachyov's bank brought a libel suit against the newspaper, citing financial losses, as a number of its customers had allegedly changed the terms of their accounts in a way which made the bank lose money because of the publication. On 28 February 2002, the bank won the case in Moscow's Basmanny municipal court and was awarded 15 million [[Russian ruble|ruble]]s (about $500,000) in lost revenue, an unprecedented sum for Russian newspapers that might undermine the very existence of ''Novaya Gazeta'', especially as on 22 February ''Novaya Gazeta'' had been ordered by the same Basmanny court to pay about $1 million for a corruption allegation against the [[Krasnodar Krai]]'s top judge.

In April, the decision on the International Industrial Bank case was reconfirmed by a court. However, in an article of 27 May 2002,<ref>{{cite web |author=Latynina, Yulia |date=27 May 2002 |script-title=ru:Можно ли сделать из стиральной машины автомат Калашникова? |url= http://2002.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2002/37n/n37n-s08.shtml |language=ru |work=Novaya Gazeta |accessdate=27 November 2009}}</ref> [[Yulia Latynina]], a ''Novaya Gazeta'' journalist, revealed that the bank's three customers named in the lawsuit were its subsidiaries or otherwise controlled by its board of directors, and claimed that ''Novaya Gazeta'' had requested the opening of a criminal fraud investigation into the activities of the bank. As a result, in June 2002 the International Industrial Bank renounced its claim to the compensation.<ref>[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/7083a.cfm]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111024156/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/7083a.cfm |date=11 January 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[Vladimir Pribylovsky]] |author2=[[Yuri Felshtinsky]] |script-title=ru:Операция «Наследник» |trans-title=Operation "Successor" |url=http://www.felshtinsky.com/books/put/Put_7.doc |trans-chapter=Suppression of the Media |chapter=Подавление СМИ |format=DOC |year=2004 |language=ru |accessdate=27 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327002617/http://www.felshtinsky.com/books/put/Put_7.doc |archive-date=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Yury Shchekochikhin===
[[Yury Shchekochikhin]], a journalist and deputy in the [[State Duma]], had also worked for the newspaper as an investigative journalist and had been a deputy Editor-in-Chief until he died from a mysterious and severe allergy on 3 July 2003. Some of his contributions published in ''Novaya Gazeta'' were related to the investigation of the [[Three Whales Corruption Scandal]].

===Mishap with Prime Minister Sergey Kirienko===
In 2004, the newspaper printed seven articles by columnist Georgy Rozhnov, which accused [[Sergey Kiriyenko]] of embezzling US$4.8 billion of [[International Monetary Fund]] funds in 1998 when he was [[Prime Minister of Russia]].<ref name="cjeskiriyenko"/> The newspaper based the accusations on a letter allegedly written to [[Colin Powell]] and signed by [[Congressman|U.S. Congressmen]] [[Philip Crane]], [[Mike Pence]], [[Charlie Norwood]], [[Dan Burton]] and [[Henry Bonilla]] and posted on the website of the American Defense Council.<ref name="punkd"/> The newspaper claimed that Kiriyenko had used some of the embezzled funds to purchase real estate in the United States. It was later revealed that the letter was a prank concocted by ''[[The eXile]]''.<ref name="punkd">{{cite news |last = Ames |first = Mark |author-link = Mark Ames |title = Double Punk'd!

[[Igor Domnikov]] was well known in Novaya Gazeta among his colleagues for his witty essays and acerbic tone. He was attacked on his way to his [[Moscow]] apartment, near the doorway, on 12 May 2000.

''Novaya Gazeta'' regularly contain free inserts of its side-projects or other newly launched newspapers. The ''United Civil Front'' (by the [[United Civil Front|corresponding organisation]]) and [[Yabloko]]'s newspaper were published in the form of inserts in the past. Current inserts include the ''Shofyor'' ("Driver" or "chauffeur", {{lang-ru|link=no|Шофёр}}) side project and the [[popular science]] ''Kentavr'' ("Centaur", {{lang-ru|link=no|Кентавр}}).

The Russian version of ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' was promoted by being issued as such inserts for one year. The number of subscribers after that amounted to 43 and continuation of issuing the insert would have been considered senseless.<ref>{{cite news|author=Inozemtsev, Vladislav|author2=Ekaterina Kuznetsova|date=26 July 2007|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2007/56/11.html|script-title=ru:Уважаемые читатели «Новой газеты»!|language=ru|work=Novaya Gazeta|display-authors=etal|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825033558/http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2007/56/11.html|archive-date=25 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''Novaya Gazeta'' has also published ''[[The New York Times]] International Weekly'' on Fridays since 2009.
