'''Henley Business School ''' is the [[business school]] of the [[University of Reading]]. It was formed by merging the previously independent '''Henley Management College''', formerly the '''Administrative Staff College''', with the existing business school of the University of Reading. As a result of the merger it now occupies two sites: [[Greenlands|Greenlands Campus]], near the town of [[Henley-on-Thames]], the original site of the Henley Management College, and [[Whiteknights Park|Whiteknights Campus]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].

==History==
[[Image:Henley Management College.jpg|thumb|Greenlands campus on the banks of the river Thames]]

===1945-1981===
The Administrative Staff College was set up in 1945 at [[Henley-on-Thames]] as the civilian equivalent of the military [[staff college]]s. It offered short courses in problems of advanced management. The college was offered the use of [[Greenlands]] by the [[William Smith, 3rd Viscount Hambleden|3rd Viscount Hambledon]] in 1946, and was bought outright from the family in 1952. In its formative years, the college was influenced by the management consultant and writer [[Lyndall Urwick]], the academic [[Hector Hetherington]], the civil servant [[Donald Banks|Sir Donald Banks]] and the businessman [[Geoffrey Heyworth, 1st Baron Heyworth|Sir Geoffrey Heyworth]] (later Lord Heyworth);<ref>Brech, Edward, Andrew Thomson & John F Wilson, ''Lyndall Urwick, Management Pioneer: A Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2010.</ref> its curriculum was designed by its first principal, [[Noel Frederick Hall|Noel Hall]]. From the beginning, its intention was to bring together executives from [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Her Majesty's Civil Service]], private business and [[Nationalization#United Kingdom|nationalised industries]] to help develop their skills for promotion to senior management.

===1981-2008===
In 1981, the college changed its name from its original title to '''Henley - The Management College'''. This was changed again to the '''Henley Management College''' when it was awarded a [[Royal charter#United Kingdom|royal charter]] in 1991. In the 1980s the college's full time and part time MBA education were based at Brunel University. In the beginning the MBAs were awarded by Brunel University. By 2002, the college achieved [[triple accreditation]] status from the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB), the [[Association of MBAs]] (AMBA) and the [[European Quality Improvement System]] (EQUIS).<ref>{{cite web|title=Henley Business School rankings and facts|url=http://www.henley.ac.uk/about/hbs-business-school-rankings.aspx|publisher=Henley Business School|accessdate=18 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015003500/http://www.henley.ac.uk/about/hbs-business-school-rankings.aspx|archivedate=15 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Greenlands campus of the college is located on the banks of the river [[Thames]] near Henley-on-Thames, on a [[country estate]] and former home of the [[WH Smith]] family.

===2008-present===
In 2008, the Henley Management College merged with the University of Reading to form the '''Henley Business School'''. It consists of the School of International Business and Strategy; the School of Leadership, Organisations and Behaviour; the School of Marketing and Reputation; the School of Business Informatics, Systems and Accountancy (which includes the Informatics Research Centre); the School of Real Estate & Planning; the [[ICMA Centre]]; and Executive Education Programmes.

While the [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] and corporate learning activities are offered from the Greenlands campus, all [[undergraduate]], [[postgraduate]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] courses are offered from the Whiteknights campus of the University of Reading.

A former country estate of the [[Marquis of Blandford]], the 130 hectare Whiteknights campus holds conservation meadows, a rare tree collection and a large lake. In 2009 the school moved into a new building in Whiteknights, with facilities for lectures, conferences and visitors.

Each local campus and subsidiary could vary in what is offered, with each having some local customisation.  A number of countries have a full local campus, with local teaching staff and local accreditation (the [[Henley Business School South Africa]], for example). A number of others, which Henley lists as countries they serve, have an office without local instructors. Students in those countries must either travel abroad or use the distance learning mode to complete their degrees.
