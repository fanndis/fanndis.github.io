Intel supplies microprocessors for [[List of computer system manufacturers|computer system manufacturers]] such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Lenovo]], [[HP Inc.|HP]], and [[Dell Technologies|Dell]]. Intel also manufactures [[motherboard]] [[chipset]]s, [[network interface controller]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s, [[flash memory]], [[Graphics processing unit|graphics chips]], [[Embedded system|embedded processors]] and other devices related to communications and computing.

Intel Corporation was founded on July 18, 1968 by semiconductor pioneers [[Robert Noyce]] and [[Gordon Moore]] (of [[Moore's law]]), and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of [[Andrew Grove]]. The company's name was conceived as [[portmanteau]] of the words ''int''egrated and ''el''ectronics, with co-founder Noyce having been a key inventor of the [[Integrated circuit#Invention|integrated circuit]] (the microchip). The fact that "intel" is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate.<ref name=Inquirer>{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1031210/secret-intel-revealed|title=Secret of Intel's name revealed|publisher=The Inquirer |year=2007 |access-date=June 11, 2012}}</ref> Intel was an early developer of [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] and [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the [[personal computer]] (PC) that this became its primary business.

During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the [[computer industry]]. During this period, Intel became the [[Market dominance|dominant]] supplier of microprocessors for PCs and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD), as well as a struggle with [[Microsoft]] for control over the direction of the PC industry.<ref name='CNET September 23, 1998'>{{cite web|first=Dan |last=Goodin |title=Microsoft's holy war on Java |date=September 23, 1998 |website=CNET |url=http://news.cnet.com/2009-1001-215854.html |access-date=November 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214907/http://news.cnet.com/2009-1001-215854.html |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name='BBC December 14, 1998'>{{Cite news |author-last=Lea |author-first=Graham |author-link=Graham Lea (journalist) |title=USA versus Microsoft: the fourth week |date=December 14, 1998 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/04/98/microsoft/215645.stm |work=BBC News |access-date=January 7, 2008 }}</ref>

====Historical market share====
In the 1980s Intel was among the top ten sellers of [[semiconductors]] (10th in 1987) in the world. In 1992,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Intel|title=Intel Timeline: A History of Innovation|url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/history/historic-timeline.html|website=Intel|access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> Intel became the biggest chip maker by revenue and held the position until 2018 when it was surpassed by Samsung, but Intel returned to its former position the year after.<ref>https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-retook-semiconductor-top-spot-from-samsung-in-2019/</ref> Other top semiconductor companies include [[TSMC]], [[Advanced Micro Devices]], [[Samsung]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[Toshiba]] and [[STMicroelectronics]].

====Major competitors====
Intel's competitors in PC chipsets include [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD), [[VIA Technologies]], [[Silicon Integrated Systems]], and [[Nvidia]]. Intel's competitors in networking include [[NXP Semiconductors]], [[Infineon]], [[Broadcom Limited]], [[Marvell Technology Group]] and [[Applied Micro Circuits Corporation]], and competitors in flash memory include [[Spansion]], [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Qimonda]], [[Toshiba]], [[STMicroelectronics]], and [[SK Hynix]].

The only major competitor in the [[x86]] processor market is AMD, with which Intel has had full cross-licensing agreements since 1976: each partner can use the other's patented technological innovations without charge after a certain time.<ref name='Intel-AMD deal 2001'>{{Cite news | first=Ian | last=Fried |title=Intel, AMD sign new licensing deal| url=https://www.cnet.com/news/intel-amd-sign-new-licensing-deal/ | publisher=[[CNet]] |access-date=July 28, 2007 | date=April 4, 2001}}</ref> However, the cross-licensing agreement is canceled in the event of an AMD bankruptcy or takeover.<ref name='Patent Cross License Agreement'>{{Cite news|title=Patent Cross License Agreement – Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp. |publisher=Findlaws, Inc |url=http://contracts.corporate.findlaw.com/agreements/amd/intel.license.2001.01.01.html |access-date=September 15, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621084244/http://contracts.corporate.findlaw.com/agreements/amd/intel.license.2001.01.01.html |archive-date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref>

Some smaller competitors such as VIA Technologies produce [[low-power electronics|low-power]] x86 processors for small factor computers and portable equipment. However, the advent of such mobile computing devices, in particular, [[smartphone]]s, has in recent years led to a decline in PC sales.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lohr|first=Steve|title=Intel's Profit Falls 25% With Decline in Chip Sales|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/technology/intel-profits-fall-as-pc-slump-cuts-demand-for-chips.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 17, 2013|date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> Since over 95% of the world's smartphones currently use processors designed by [[ARM Holdings]], ARM has become a major competitor for Intel's processor market.

===Early history===
At its founding, Intel was distinguished by its ability to make [[logic circuit]]s using [[semiconductor device]]s. The founders' goal was the [[semiconductor memory]] market, widely predicted to replace [[magnetic-core memory]]. Its first product, a quick entry into the small, high-speed memory market in 1969, was the 3101 [[Schottky transistor|Schottky TTL]] [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] 64-bit [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM), which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba, Japan]].<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1969-Schottky.html 1969&nbsp;– Schottky-Barrier Diode Doubles the Speed of TTL Memory & Logic] Computer History Museum.

Intel created the [[Intel 4004|first commercially available microprocessor (Intel 4004)]] in 1971.<ref name="Intel_Museum" /> The microprocessor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry, as it miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer, which then made it possible for small machines to perform calculations that in the past only very large machines could do. Considerable technological innovation was needed before the microprocessor could actually become the basis of what was first known as a "mini computer" and then known as a "personal computer".<ref>''The Unfinished Nation'', Volume 2, Brinkley, p. 786.</ref> Intel also created one of the first [[microcomputer]]s in 1973.<ref name='Intel-Product-Timeline' /><ref name='Intellec-1973'>{{cite web |url=http://www.old-computers.com/MUSEUM/computer.asp?c=754&st=1 |title=Intel Intellec Series |access-date=July 31, 2007 |last=Silberhorn |first=Gottfried |author2=Colin Douglas Howell |work=old-computers.com |publisher=OLD-COMPUTERS.COM |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727141838/http://www.old-computers.com/MUSEUM/computer.asp?c=754&st=1 |archive-date=July 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Intel opened its first international manufacturing facility in 1972, in [[Malaysia]], which would host multiple Intel operations, before opening assembly facilities and semiconductor plants in [[Singapore]] and [[Jerusalem]] in the early 1980s, and manufacturing and development centres in China, India and Costa Rica in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Intel: 35 Years of Innovation (1968–2003) |url=https://www.intel.com/Assets/PDF/General/35yrs.pdf |publisher=Intel |year=2003 |access-date=26 June 2019}}</ref> By the early 1980s, its business was dominated by [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) chips. However, increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had, by 1983, dramatically reduced the profitability of this market. The growing success of the [[IBM]] personal computer, based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore (CEO since 1975) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model. Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success.

By the end of the 1980s, buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM's competitors within the rapidly growing [[IBM PC compatible|personal computer market]], Intel embarked on a 10-year period of unprecedented growth as the primary (and most profitable) hardware supplier to the PC industry, part of the winning 'Wintel' combination. Moore handed over to Andy Grove in 1987. By launching its Intel Inside [[marketing campaign]] in 1991, Intel was able to associate [[brand loyalty]] with consumer selection, so that by the end of the 1990s, its line of [[Pentium]] processors had become a household name.

===Slowing demand and challenges to dominance in 2000===
After 2000, growth in demand for high-end microprocessors slowed. Competitors, notably [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] (Intel's largest competitor in its primary [[x86|x86 architecture]] market), garnered significant market share, initially in low-end and mid-range processors but ultimately across the product range, and Intel's dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced,<ref name="Wong">{{Cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060731&slug=btintelchip31|title=Intel Core 2 Duo a big leap in chip race|last=Wong|first=Nicole|date=July 31, 2006|work=Seattle Times|access-date=October 15, 2009}}</ref> mostly due to controversial [[NetBurst (microarchitecture)|NetBurst]] microarchitecture. In the early 2000s then-CEO, [[Craig Barrett (businessman)|Craig Barrett]] attempted to diversify the company's business beyond semiconductors, but few of these activities were ultimately successful.

===Litigation===
Intel had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation. US law did not initially recognize [[intellectual property rights]] related to microprocessor [[topology (electrical circuits)|topology]] (circuit layouts), until the [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984]], a law sought by Intel and the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).<ref>The Senate Report on the bill (S.Rep. No. 425, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. (1984)) stated: "In the semiconductor industry, innovation is indispensable; research breakthroughs are essential to the life and health of the industry. But research and innovation in the design of semiconductor chips are threatened by the inadequacies of existing legal protection against piracy and unauthorized copying. This problem, which is so critical to this essential sector of the American economy, is addressed by the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984. ...[The bill] would prohibit "chip piracy"--the unauthorized copying and distribution of semiconductor chip products copied from the original creators of such works." Quoted in [http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/977/1555/304802/ Brooktree Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.], 977 F.2d 1555, 17 (Fed. Cir. 1992). See also ''Brooktree'', 21–22 (copyright and patent law ineffective).</ref> During the late 1980s and 1990s (after this law was passed), Intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the [[Intel 80386|80386]] [[CPU]].<ref name="ReferenceA">"Bill Gates Speaks", page 29. {{ISBN|978-0-471-40169-8}}</ref> The lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills, even if Intel lost the suits.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> [[Antitrust]] allegations had been simmering since the early 1990s and had been the cause of one [[lawsuit]] against Intel in 1991. In 2004 and 2005, AMD brought [[Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.|further claims]] against Intel related to [[unfair competition]].

===Regaining of momentum (2005–2007)===
In 2005, CEO [[Paul Otellini]] reorganized the company to refocus its core processor and chipset business on platforms (enterprise, digital home, digital health, and mobility).

====Opening up the foundries to other manufacturers (2013)====
Finding itself with excess fab capacity after the failure of the [[Ultrabook]] to gain market traction and with PC sales declining, in 2013 Intel reached a [[Semiconductor fabrication plant|foundry]] agreement to produce chips for [[Altera]] using 14-nm process. General Manager of Intel's custom foundry division Sunit Rikhi indicated that Intel would pursue further such deals in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/02/26/intel_altera_chip_deal/|title=Intel throws open chip ovens to Altera – but who's next: Apple?}}</ref> This was after poor sales of [[Windows 8]] hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers, except for Qualcomm, which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer, Apple.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2013/03/18/chip_maker_cut_inventory/|title=Intel and pals shrink their semis by $600m as demand droops • The Channel}}</ref>

As of July 2013, five companies were using Intel's fabs via the ''Intel Custom Foundry'' division: [[Achronix]], [[Tabula (company)|Tabula]], [[Netronome]], [[Microsemi]], and [[Panasonic]]{{snd}} most are [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA) makers, but Netronome designs network processors.

The [[Alliance for Affordable Internet]] (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Intel is part of the coalition of public and private organisations that also includes [[Facebook]], [[Google]], and [[Microsoft]]. Led by [[Tim Berners-Lee|Sir Tim Berners-Lee]], the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Google lead coalition for cheaper Internet|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/google-berners-lee-alliance-broadband-africa?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2&et_cid=51918&et_rid=7107573&Linkid=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theguardian.com%2ftechnology%2f2013%2foct%2f07%2fgoogle-berners-lee-alliance-broadband-africa|access-date=October 8, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=October 7, 2013|author=Samuel Gibbs}}</ref>

==Product and market history==
{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}

===SRAMS and the microprocessor===
Intel's first products were [[shift register]] memory and random-access [[Primary storage|memory]] integrated circuits, and Intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive [[dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]], [[static random-access memory|SRAM]], and [[read-only memory|ROM]] markets throughout the 1970s. Concurrently, Intel engineers [[Marcian Hoff]], [[Federico Faggin]], [[Stanley Mazor]] and [[Masatoshi Shima]] invented Intel's first [[microprocessor]]. Originally developed for the Japanese company [[Busicom]] to replace a number of [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASICs]] in a calculator already produced by Busicom, the [[Intel 4004]] was introduced to the mass market on November 15, 1971, though the microprocessor did not become the core of Intel's business until the mid-1980s. (Note: Intel is usually given credit with [[Texas Instruments]] for the almost-simultaneous invention of the microprocessor)

===From DRAM to microprocessors===
In 1983, at the dawn of the personal computer era, Intel's profits came under increased pressure from Japanese memory-chip manufacturers, and then-president Andy Grove focused the company on microprocessors. Grove described this transition in the book ''[[Only the Paranoid Survive]]''. A key element of his plan was the notion, then considered radical, of becoming the single source for successors to the popular [[Intel 8086|8086]] microprocessor.

Until then, the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplier, but Grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factories,{{which|date=October 2013}} and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as [[Zilog]] and [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} When the PC industry boomed in the late 1980s and 1990s, Intel was one of the primary beneficiaries.

===Intel, x86 processors, and the IBM PC===
[[File:Intel 8742 153056995.jpg|thumb|The [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] from an Intel 8742, an [[8-bit]] microcontroller that includes a [[CPU]] running at 12&nbsp;MHz, 128 bytes of [[RAM]], 2048 bytes of [[EPROM]], and [[Input/output|I/O]] in the same chip]]

Despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor, the [[Intel 4004|4004]] and its successors the [[Intel 8008|8008]] and the [[Intel 8080|8080]] were never major revenue contributors at Intel. As the next processor, the [[Intel 8086|8086]] (and its variant the 8088) was completed in 1978, Intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed "Operation Crush", and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible. One design win was the newly created [[IBM PC]] division, though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time.

[[IBM]] introduced its personal computer in 1981, and it was rapidly successful. In 1982, Intel created the [[Intel 80286|80286]] microprocessor, which, two years later, was used in the [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM PC/AT]]. [[Compaq]], the first IBM PC "clone" manufacturer, produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first [[Intel 80386|80386]]-based system, beating IBM and establishing a competitive market for PC-compatible systems and setting up Intel as a key component supplier.

On April 2020 the company announced its latest Comet Lake-S processors across its Core i9, i7, i5,and i3lineups. Leading the range is the new Corei9-10900k, which offers 10 cores, 20 threads, a 125W TDP boosted speed up to 5.3GHZ, and according to Intel, its "the world's fastest gaming processor".

In 1975, the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32-bit microprocessor, finally released in 1981 as the [[Intel iAPX 432]]. The project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives, and it failed in the marketplace. Intel extended the [[x86|x86 architecture]] to 32 bits instead.<ref>{{cite web

====386 microprocessor====
During this period [[Andrew Grove]] dramatically redirected the company, closing much of its [[DRAM]] business and directing resources to the [[microprocessor]] business. Of perhaps greater importance was his decision to "single-source" the 386 microprocessor. Prior to this, microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy, and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production, interrupting supplies to customers. To mitigate this risk, these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply. The 8080 and 8086-series microprocessors were produced by several companies, notably AMD, with which Intel had a technology-sharing contract. Grove made the decision not to license the 386 design to other manufacturers, instead, producing it in three geographically distinct factories: [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], California; [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], Oregon; and [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]], a suburb of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], Arizona. He convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery. In doing this, Intel breached its contract with AMD, which sued and was paid millions of dollars in damages but could not manufacture new Intel CPU designs any longer. (Instead, AMD started to develop and manufacture its own competing x86 designs.) As the success of Compaq's Deskpro 386 established the 386 as the dominant CPU choice, Intel achieved a position of near-exclusive dominance as its supplier. Profits from this funded rapid development of both higher-performance chip designs and higher-performance manufacturing capabilities, propelling Intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early 1990s.

====486, Pentium, and Itanium====
Intel introduced the [[Intel 80486|486]] microprocessor in 1989, and in 1990 established a second design team, designing the processors code-named "P5" and "P6" in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years, versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken. Engineers [[Vinod Dham]] and [[Rajeev Chandrasekhar]] (Member of Parliament, India) were key figures on the core team that invented the 486 chip and later, Intel's signature Pentium chip. The P5 project was earlier known as "Operation Bicycle," referring to the cycles of the processor through two parallel execution pipelines. The [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] was introduced in 1993 as the Intel [[Pentium]], substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number (numbers, such as 486, cannot be legally registered as trademarks in the United States). The P6 followed in 1995 as the [[Pentium Pro]] and improved into the [[Pentium II]] in 1997. New architectures were developed alternately in [[Santa Clara, California]] and [[Hillsboro, Oregon]].

The Santa Clara design team embarked in 1993 on a successor to the [[x86|x86 architecture]], codenamed "P7". The first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with [[Hewlett-Packard]] engineers, though Intel soon took over primary design responsibility. The resulting implementation of the [[Itanium|IA-64]] 64-bit architecture was the [[Itanium]], finally introduced in June 2001. The Itanium's performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations, and it failed to compete effectively with [[x86-64]], which was AMD's 64-bit extension of the 32-bit x86 architecture (Intel uses the name '''Intel 64''', previously '''EM64T'''). In 2017, Intel announced that the [[Itanium#Itanium 9700 (Kittson): 2017|Itanium 9700 series (Kittson)]] would be the last Itanium chips produced.<ref name="Davis 2017">{{cite web

The Hillsboro team designed the [[Pentium 4#Willamette|Willamette]] processors (initially code-named P68), which were marketed as the Pentium 4.

====Pentium flaw====
{{Main|Pentium FDIV bug}}
In June 1994, Intel engineers discovered a flaw in the [[floating-point]] math subsection of the [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium|Pentium microprocessor]]. Under certain data-dependent conditions, the low-order bits of the result of a floating-point division would be incorrect. The error could compound in subsequent calculations. Intel corrected the error in a future chip revision, and under public pressure it issued a total recall and replaced the defective Pentium CPUs (which were limited to some 60, 66, 75, 90, and 100&nbsp;MHz models<ref>[[Pentium FDIV bug#Affected models]]</ref>) on customer request.

The [[software bug|bug]] was discovered independently in October 1994 by Thomas Nicely, Professor of Mathematics at [[Lynchburg College]]. He contacted Intel but received no response. On October 30, he posted a message about his finding on the Internet.<ref name='Nicely-email'>{{cite web|url=http://www.emery.com/nicely.htm |title=Dr. Thomas Nicely's Pentium email |access-date=July 12, 2007 |last=Nicely |first=Dr. Thomas R. |date=October 30, 1994 |publisher=Vince Emery Productions }}</ref> Word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press. The bug was easy to replicate; a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system. Consequently, many users did not accept Intel's statements that the error was minor and "not even an erratum." During Thanksgiving, in 1994, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a piece by journalist [[John Markoff]] spotlighting the error. Intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip, quickly putting in place a large end-user [[Technical support|support]] organization.

The "Pentium flaw" incident, Intel's response to it, and the surrounding media coverage propelled Intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name. Dovetailing with an uptick in the "Intel Inside" campaign, the episode is considered to have been a positive event for Intel, changing some of its business practices to be more end-user focused and generating substantial public awareness, while avoiding a lasting negative impression.<ref>Grove, Andrew and Burgleman, Robert; ''Strategy Is Destiny: How Strategy-Making Shapes a Company's Future'', 2001, Free Press<!--needs page number--></ref>

During this period, Intel undertook two major supporting advertising campaigns. The first campaign, the 1991 "Intel Inside" marketing and branding campaign, is widely known and has become synonymous with Intel itself. The idea of "[[ingredient branding]]" was new at the time, with only [[NutraSweet]] and a few others making attempts to do so.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Richard S. Tedlow|title=Andy Grove: The Life and Times of an American Business Icon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQamXENAalkC&pg=RA1-PA256|page=256|year=2007|isbn=978-1-59184-182-1}}</ref> This campaign established Intel, which had been a component supplier little-known outside the PC industry, as a household name.

The second campaign, Intel's Systems Group, which began in the early 1990s, showcased manufacturing of PC [[motherboard]]s, the main board component of a personal computer, and the one into which the processor (CPU) and memory (RAM) chips are plugged.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Tracy V. | url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/motherboard.htm | title=HowStuffWorks "How Motherboards Work" |publisher=Computer.howstuffworks.com |access-date=July 29, 2010|date=July 20, 2005 }}</ref> The Systems Group campaign was lesser known than the Intel Inside campaign.

Shortly after, Intel began manufacturing fully configured "[[white box (computer hardware)|white box]]" systems for the dozens of PC clone companies that rapidly sprang up.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} At its peak in the mid-1990s, Intel manufactured over 15% of all PCs, making it the third-largest supplier at the time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

During the 1990s, [[Intel Architecture Labs]] (IAL) was responsible for many of the hardware innovations for the PC, including the [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] Bus, the [[PCI Express]] (PCIe) bus, and [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB). IAL's software efforts met with a more mixed fate; its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from [[Microsoft]]. The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by then IAL Vice-President [[Steven McGeady]] at the [[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|Microsoft antitrust trial]] (''United States v. Microsoft Corp.'').

===Competition, antitrust and espionage===
{{See also|AMD v. Intel}}
Two factors combined to end this dominance: the slowing of [[personal computer|PC]] demand growth beginning in 2000 and the rise of the low-cost PC. By the end of the 1990s, [[microprocessor]] performance had outstripped software demand for that CPU power. Aside from high-end server systems and software, whose demand dropped with the end of the "[[dot-com bubble]]", consumer systems ran effectively on increasingly low-cost systems after 2000. Intel's strategy of producing ever-more-powerful processors and obsoleting their predecessors stumbled,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} leaving an opportunity for rapid gains by competitors, notably AMD. This, in turn, lowered the profitability{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} of the processor line and ended an era of unprecedented dominance of the PC hardware by Intel.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Intel's dominance in the [[x86]] microprocessor market led to numerous charges of [[antitrust]] violations over the years, including [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] investigations in both the late 1980s and in 1999, and civil actions such as the 1997 suit by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) and a patent suit by [[Intergraph]]. Intel's market dominance (at one time{{When|date=May 2009}} it controlled over 85% of the market for 32-bit x86 microprocessors) combined with Intel's own hardball legal tactics (such as its infamous 338 patent suit versus PC manufacturers)<ref>{{Cite news|first=Richard |last=McCausland |title=Counterpunch: Amx86 buyers get 'legal aid.' – Advanced Micro Devices offers legal aid to manufactures of Amx86-based machines warned by Intel Corp. to take out patent licenses |date=May 24, 1993 |publisher=LookSmart Ltd. |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EKF/is_n1964_v39/ai_13901771 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001091856/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EKF/is_n1964_v39/ai_13901771 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 1, 2009 |work=FindArticles |access-date=July 12, 2007 }}</ref> made it an attractive target for litigation, but few of the lawsuits ever amounted to anything.{{Clarify|date=May 2009}}

===Use of Intel products by Apple Computer (2005–2022)===
<!--Please rewrite from Intel's perspective. This only says the advantages for Apple (Amply written about in its own articles), not Intel-->
{{details|Mac transition to Intel processors}}

On June 6, 2005, [[Steve Jobs]], then CEO of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], announced that Apple would be transitioning from its long favored [[PowerPC]] architecture to the Intel x86 architecture because the future PowerPC road map was unable to satisfy Apple's needs. The first [[Macintosh]] computers containing Intel CPUs were announced on January 10, 2006, and Apple had its entire line of consumer Macs running on Intel processors by early August 2006. The Apple Xserve server was updated to Intel [[Xeon]] processors from November 2006 and was offered in a configuration similar to Apple's Mac Pro.<ref name=newmacs>

On June 22, 2020, during the virtual WWDC, Apple announced that they would be switching some of their Mac line to their own ARM-based designs. By November 14, 2020, Apple unveiled their new ARM-based 'M1 Apple Silicon' processor that officially marks the end of Apple purchases of intel microprocessors. The move from Intel to in house 'Apple Silicon' will take 2 years.

===Marketing===<!-- This section is linked from [[x86|X86 architecture]] -->

====Intel Inside====
Intel has become one of the world's most recognizable computer brands following its long-running ''Intel Inside'' [[advertising campaign|campaign]]. The idea for "Intel Inside" came out of a meeting between Intel and one of the major computer resellers, [[MicroAge]].<ref name="Mion">Ronald J. Mion, former Vice President of Marketing (2/88-7/89), MicroAge, cited February, 2016</ref>

In the late 1980s, Intel's market share was being seriously eroded by upstart competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices (now AMD), Zilog, and others who had started to sell their less expensive microprocessors to computer manufacturers. This was because, by using cheaper processors, manufacturers could make cheaper computers and gain more market share in an increasingly price-sensitive market. In 1989, Intel's Dennis Carter visited MicroAge's headquarters in Tempe, Arizona, to meet with MicroAge's VP of Marketing, Ron Mion. MicroAge had become one of the largest distributors of Compaq, IBM, HP, and others and thus was a primary{{snd}} although indirect{{snd}} driver of demand for microprocessors. Intel wanted MicroAge to petition its computer suppliers to favor Intel chips. However, Mion felt that the marketplace should decide which processors they wanted. Intel's counterargument was that it would be too difficult to educate PC buyers on why Intel microprocessors were worth paying more for ... and they were right.<ref name="Mion"/> But Mion felt that the public didn't really need to fully understand why Intel chips were better, they just needed to feel they were better. So Mion proposed a market test. Intel would pay for a MicroAge billboard somewhere saying, "If you're buying a personal computer, make sure it has Intel inside." In turn, MicroAge would put "Intel Inside" stickers on the Intel-based computers in their stores in that area. To make the test easier to monitor, Mion decided to do the test in Boulder, Colorado, where it had a single store. Virtually overnight, the sales of personal computers in that store dramatically shifted to Intel-based PCs. Intel very quickly adopted "Intel Inside" as its primary branding and rolled it out worldwide.<ref name="Mion"/>

As is often the case with computer lore, other tidbits have been combined to explain how things evolved. "Intel Inside" has not escaped that tendency and there are other "explanations" that had been floating around.

Intel's branding campaign started with "The Computer Inside" tagline in 1990 in the US and Europe. The Japan chapter of Intel proposed an "Intel in it" tagline and kicked off the Japanese campaign by hosting EKI-KON (meaning "Station Concert" in Japanese) at the Tokyo railway station dome on Christmas Day, December 25, 1990. Several months later, "The Computer Inside" incorporated the Japan idea to become "Intel Inside" which eventually elevated to the worldwide branding campaign in 1991, by Intel marketing manager Dennis Carter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Intel Inside Program: Anatomy of a Brand Campaign|url=http://www.intel.com/pressroom/intel_inside.htm|publisher=Intel Corporation|access-date=July 22, 2011}}</ref> A case study, "Inside Intel Inside", was put together by Harvard Business School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=29096|title=Inside Intel Inside|first1=Youngme E.|last1=Moon |first2=Christina L.|last2=Darwall|id=Harvard Business School Case 502-083|date=June 2002}}</ref> The five-note jingle was introduced in 1994 and by its tenth anniversary was being heard in 130 countries around the world. The initial branding agency for the "Intel Inside" campaign was DahlinSmithWhite Advertising of [[Salt Lake City]]. The Intel ''swirl'' logo was the work of DahlinSmithWhite art director Steve Grigg under the direction of Intel president and CEO Andy Grove.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Advertisements for products featuring Intel processors with prominent MMX branding featured a version of the jingle with an embellishment (shining sound) after the final note.

====Processor naming strategy====
In 2006, Intel expanded its promotion of open specification platforms beyond [[Centrino]], to include the [[Viiv]] media center PC and the business desktop [[Intel vPro]].

In mid-January 2006, Intel announced that they were dropping the long running ''Pentium'' name from their processors. The Pentium name was first used to refer to the P5 core Intel processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers, so competitors could not just call their processor the same name, as had been done with the prior 386 and 486 processors (both of which had copies manufactured by IBM and AMD). They phased out the Pentium names from mobile processors first, when the new [[Yonah (microprocessor)|Yonah]] chips, branded [[Intel Core|Core]] Solo and Core Duo, were released. The desktop processors changed when the Core 2 line of processors were released. By 2009, Intel was using a good-better-best strategy with Celeron being good, Pentium better, and the Intel Core family representing the best the company has to offer.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/166973/intels_chip_renaming_strategy_meets_resistance.html |title=Intel's Chip Renaming Strategy Meets Resistance |last=Shah |first=Agam |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref>

According to spokesman Bill Calder, Intel has maintained only the Celeron brand, the Atom brand for netbooks and the vPro lineup for businesses. Since late 2009, Intel's mainstream processors have been called Celeron, Pentium, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9 in order of performance from lowest to highest. The first generation core products carry a 3 digit name, such as i5 750, and the second generation products carry a 4 digit name, such as the i5 2500. In both cases, a K at the end of it shows that it is an unlocked processor, enabling additional overclocking abilities (for instance, 2500K). vPro products will carry the Intel Core i7 vPro processor or the Intel Core i5 vPro processor name.<ref name=Mag>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2348923,00.asp |title=Intel Simplifying its Processor Branding |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=June 17, 2009 |work=[[PC Magazine]] |access-date=July 6, 2009}}</ref> In October 2011, Intel started to sell its Core i7-2700K "Sandy Bridge" chip to customers worldwide.<ref>Anton Shilov, XBitLabs.

In November 2009, following a two-year investigation, [[New York Attorney General]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] sued Intel, accusing them of bribery and coercion, claiming that Intel bribed computer makers to buy more of their chips than those of their rivals and threatened to withdraw these payments if the computer makers were perceived as working too closely with its competitors.

During a sub-committee meeting of the New Mexico Environment Improvement Board, a resident claimed that Intel's own reports documented more than {{convert|1580|lb}} of VOCs were released in June and July 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corralescomment.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=616&Itemid=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705144619/http://corralescomment.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=616&Itemid=2|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 5, 2012|title=Corrales Comment - Local Village News, Issues, Events & Ads - Intel Pollution Control Shut Down Probed|date=July 5, 2012}}</ref>

===Age discrimination complaints===
Intel has faced complaints of [[age discrimination]] in firing and layoffs. Intel was sued in 1993 by nine former employees, over allegations that they were laid off because they were over the age of 40.<ref>"Intel Sued for Discrimination", ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', January 30, 1993, B-12.</ref>

A group called FACE Intel (Former and Current Employees of Intel) claims that Intel weeds out older employees. FACE Intel claims that more than 90 percent of people who have been laid off or fired from Intel are over the age of 40. ''[[Upside (magazine)|Upside]]'' magazine requested data from Intel breaking out its hiring and firing by age, but the company declined to provide any.<ref name="upside">Alster, Norm, (December 7, 1998). [http://www.programmersguild.org/archives/lib/agediscimination/upm19981207older.htm "Techies complain of age biases"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522163807/http://www.programmersguild.org/archives/lib/agediscimination/upm19981207older.htm |date=May 22, 2009 }}, ''Upside Magazine''.

CNET News. Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref> which overturned in 2003 in [[Intel Corp. v. Hamidi]].

===Tax dispute in India===
In August 2016, Indian officials of the [[Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike]] (BBMP) parked garbage trucks on Intel's campus and threatened to dump them for evading payment of property taxes between 2007 and 2008, to the tune of 340 million Indian rupees (US$4.9 million). Intel had reportedly been paying taxes as a non-air-conditioned office, when the campus in fact had central air conditioning. Other factors, such as land acquisition and construction improvements, added to the tax burden. Previously, Intel had appealed the demand in the [[Karnataka]] high court in July, during which the court ordered Intel to pay BBMP half the owed amount (170 million rupees, or US$2.4 million) plus arrears by August 28 of that year.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kasli|first=Shelley|date=August 10, 2016|title=Rothschild Inside, Garbage Outside|url=http://greatgameindia.com/rothschild-inside-garbage-outside/|journal=GreatGameIndia Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Kay|date=August 10, 2016|title=Indian city raises stink over Intel's unpaid taxes|url=http://www.dontmesswithtaxes.com/2016/08/indian-city-raises-stink-over-unpaid-tax-by-intel.html|website=Don't Mess With Taxes|access-date=10 January 2017}}</ref>
