'''Huddersfield''' is a [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituency]]{{#tag:ref|A [[borough constituency]] (for the purposes of election expenses and type of returning officer)|group= n}} represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] since 1983 by [[Barry Sheerman]] of [[Labour and Co-operative|Labour Co-op]].{{#tag:ref|As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election at least every five years.|group= n}}

== Boundaries ==

'''1983–2010''': The Borough of Kirklees wards of Almondbury, Birkby, Dalton, Deighton, Newsome, and Paddock.

'''2010–present''': The Borough of Kirklees wards of Almondbury, Ashbrow, Dalton, Greenhead, and Newsome.

==Constituency profile==
Apart from four years tenure as MP by [[Geoffrey Dickens]] for [[Huddersfield West (UK Parliament constituency)|Huddersfield West]] (1979-1983), the area (including its divided halves for the 33 years to 1983) has returned a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP since 1945.

The constituency is currently held by the Labour Party, although the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] made inroads by coming second in the 2005 general election, and in the 2010 general election Karen Tween of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] narrowed the [[incumbent (politics)|incumbent]]'s lead to a relatively average 4,472 votes and the new Liberal Democrat candidate slipped into third place. There are currently Green Party councillors in Newsome, and some Tory and Liberal Democrat councillors in Almondbury, but the remaining wards are safely Labour.
