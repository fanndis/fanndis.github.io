==History==
===Before Mondelez International===
{{Main|Kraft Foods Inc.#History}}

Mondelez International is rooted in the [[National Dairy Products Corporation]] (National Dairy), which was founded on December 10, 1923, by Thomas H. McInnerney and Edward E. Rieck. The firm was initially set up to execute on a [[rollup]] strategy in the fragmented United States [[ice cream]] industry.<ref>{{cite news|title=National Dairy Products Corporation Capitalization|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/26952808/the_wall_street_journal/|accessdate=January 7, 2019|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=December 12, 1923|page=10}}</ref>

In 1924, Kraft Cheese Company was founded and was listed on the [[Chicago Stock Exchange]].<ref name="kficompany">{{cite web|url=https://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Kraft-Foods-Inc-Company-History.html |title=Kraft Foods Inc. |accessdate=March 10, 2008 |year=2002 |publisher=Funding Universe |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819085253/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Kraft-Foods-Inc-Company-History.html |archive-date=August 19, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Two years later, it was listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. In 1928, it acquired Phenix Cheese Company, the maker of a [[cream cheese]] branded as [[Cream cheese#Origin|Philadelphia cream cheese]], founded by Jason F. Whitney, Sr. and the company changed its name to Kraft-Phenix Cheese Company.

In 1930, National Dairy acquired Kraft Phenix. After the acquisition, the combined company retained the National Dairy name and management, though the Kraft Phenix side of the company continued to operate largely independently.<ref>Kraftco Corporation Annual Report 1969.</ref><ref name="kficompany" />

On September 7, 2009, Kraft made a [[hostile takeover|hostile]] £10.2 billion takeover bid for the British confectionery group [[Cadbury]], makers of [[Cadbury Dairy Milk|Dairy Milk]] and [[Bournville (chocolate bar)|Bournville]] chocolate.<ref name="Cadbury">{{cite web |url = http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MTQ1ODZ8Q2hpbGRJRD0tMXxUeXBlPTM=&t=1 |accessdate = September 7, 2009 |title = Kraft Foods Inc. proposes combination with Cadbury PLC. |date = September 7, 2009 |publisher = Kraft Foods |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160114164147/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MTQ1ODZ8Q2hpbGRJRD0tMXxUeXBlPTM=&t=1 |archive-date = January 14, 2016 |url-status = dead }}</ref> On November 9 the company's bid (then £9.8 billion) was rejected by Cadbury, which called it a "derisory" offer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Business/Dairy-Milk-Maker-Cadbury-Rejects-Hostile-Takeover-Bid-From-Kraft-After-It-Rejected-Proposal/Article/200911215445594?lpos=Business_Carousel_Region_3&lid=ARTICLE_15445594_Dairy_Milk_Maker_Cadbury_Rejects_Hostile_Takeover_Bid_From_Kraft_After_It_Rejected_Proposal |title=Cadbury Rejects Kraft's 'Derisory' Takeover Bid |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=August 4, 2011}}</ref> Kraft renewed the offer on December 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7017180104?Kraft%20Formalizes%20Bid%20For%20UK%20Candy%20Maker%20Cadbury|title=Kraft Formalizes Bid For UK Candy Maker Cadbury|publisher=Allheadlinenews.com|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It had significant political and public opposition in the United Kingdom and abroad, leading to a call for the government to implement economic [[protectionism]] in large-company takeovers.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/dan-roberts-on-business-blog/2010/jan/19/kraft-cadbury-takeover |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=50 reasons to fight Kraft |date=January 19, 2010 |accessdate=May 7, 2010 |first=Dan |last=Roberts}}</ref> On January 19, 2010, Cadbury approved a revised offer from Kraft which valued the company at £11.5 billion ($19.5 billion).

Cadbury sales were flat after Kraft's acquisition. Despite the Cadbury takeover helping to boost overall sales by 30 percent, Kraft's net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24 percent (to $540 million) due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|title=Kraft Foods' profits hit by Cadbury costs|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12427830|publisher=BBC|accessdate=February 11, 2011|date=February 11, 2011}}</ref> Kraft spent $1.3 billion on integration to achieve an estimated $675 million in annual savings by the end of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=STEUBER|first=ERIN|title=Kraft, Cadbury not such a sweet deal?|url=http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=163092|publisher=Medill Reports|accessdate=April 15, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707104714/http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=163092|archive-date=July 7, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs for corn, sugar, and cocoa in North America and Europe. According to Rosenfeld, "We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future." Taking into account integration costs, the acquisition reduced Kraft's earnings per share by about 33% immediately after the Cadbury purchase.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

In August 2011, Kraft Foods announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, an international snack-food company and a North American grocery company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=129070&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1593014 |title=Kraft Foods&nbsp;– Investor Center&nbsp;– Financial News Release |publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017145022/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=129070&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1593014 |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/21/kraft-new-company-mondelez-international|title=Kraft spins off snacks business into new Mondelez International company|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 21, 2012|accessdate=March 21, 2012|location=London|first=Dominic|last=Rushe}}</ref>

The snack-food company, called Mondelez International, would be the legal successor of the old Kraft Foods, while the grocery company would be a new company, [[Kraft Foods|Kraft Foods Group]].
