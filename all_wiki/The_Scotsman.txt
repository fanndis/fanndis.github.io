''The Scotsman'' was launched<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.scotsman.com/search/results/1817-01-25/1817-01-25?NewspaperTitle=The%2BScotsman&IssueId=BL%2F0000540%2F18170125%2F&County=Midlothian%2C%20Scotland|title=The Scotsman Archive: Search |date=25 January 1817|website=The Scotsman Digital Archive|location=UK|access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref> in 1817 as a liberal weekly newspaper by lawyer [[William Ritchie (Newspaper Editor)|William Ritchie]] and [[customs]] official [[Charles Maclaren]] in response to the "unblushing subservience" of competing newspapers to the Edinburgh establishment.  The paper was pledged to "impartiality, firmness and independence". After the abolition of newspaper [[stamp tax]] in Scotland in 1855, ''The Scotsman'' was relaunched as a daily newspaper priced at [[£sd|1d]] and a circulation of 6,000 copies.

The fledgling paper was originally based at 257 High Street on the [[Royal Mile]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/directories/browse/pageturner.cfm?id=83401611&mode=transcription|title=(204) – Scottish Post Office Directories > Towns > Edinburgh > 1805–1834 – Post Office annual directory > 1832–1833 – Scottish Directories – National Library of Scotland}}</ref>

In 1860, The Scotsman obtained a purpose built office on [[Cockburn Street]] in [[Edinburgh]] designed in the [[Scots baronial]] style by the architects [[Peddie & Kinnear]].<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Peddie & Kinnear</ref> This backed onto their original offices on the Royal Mile. The building bears the initials "JR" for [[John Ritchie (newspaper owner)|John Ritchie]] the founder of the company. On 19 December 1904,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.scotsman.com/help/about|title=About – Scotsman Digital Archive|first=The Scotsman Digital|last=Archive|website=archive.scotsman.com}}</ref> they moved to huge new offices at the top of the street, facing onto North Bridge, designed by [[Dunn & Findlay]] (Findlay being the son of the then owner). This huge building had taken three years to build and also had connected printworks on Market Street (now the City Art Centre). The printworks connected below road level direct to [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Waverley station]] in a highly efficient production line.

In 1953 the newspaper was bought by Canadian millionaire [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]] who was in the process of building a large media group.  The paper was bought in 1995 by [[David and Frederick Barclay]] for £85&nbsp;million. They moved the newspaper from its Edinburgh office on [[North Bridge, Edinburgh|North Bridge]], which is now an [[The Scotsman Hotel|upmarket hotel]], to modern offices in Holyrood Road designed by Edinburgh architects CDA, near the subsequent location of the [[Scottish Parliament Building]]. The daily was awarded by the [[Society for News Design]] (SND) the World’s Best Designed Newspaper™ for 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=World's Best-Designed winners (2006)|url=http://www.snd.org/competitions/print/worlds-best-designed/|website=Society for News Design|access-date=6 October 2013|date=23 February 2011}}</ref>

In December 2005, ''The Scotsman'' along with its sister titles owned by [[The Scotsman publications|The Scotsman Publications Ltd]] was acquired, in a £160{{nbsp}}million deal, by [[Johnston Press]], a company founded in Scotland and at the time one of the top three largest local newspaper publishers in the UK.
Ian Stewart has been the editor since June 2012, after a reshuffle of senior management in April 2012 during which [[John McLellan (journalist)|John McLellan]] who was the paper's editor-in-chief was dismissed.  Ian Stewart was previously editor of ''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]'' and remains as the editor of ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]''.

In 2012, ''The Scotsman'' was named Newspaper of the Year at the Scottish Press Awards.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/49153 |title=John McLellan collects newspaper of the year award |work=Press Gazette |location=UK |date=20 April 2012 |access-date=12 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101125719/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/49153 |archive-date=1 January 2013 }}</ref>

In 2006 Barclay Brothers sold Barclay House to Irish property magnate Lochlann Quinn, and in 2013 Scottish video games maker [[Rockstar North]], of Grand Theft Auto fame, signed the lease, causing Johnston Press group to move out in June 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lambourne|first1=Helen|title=Regional daily 'to seek new headquarters'|url=http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2013/news/regional-daily-to-seek-new-headquarters/|website=Hold the Front Page|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nostalgia: Evening News on the move|publisher=Edinburgh Evening News|date=21 June 2014}}</ref> Johnston Press have downsized to refurbished premises at Orchard Brae House in Queensferry Road, Edinburgh, a move which was quoted as saving the group £1million per annum in rent.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Greenslade|first1=Roy|title=Johnston Press saves £1m a year with office move for The Scotsman|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/apr/28/the-scotsman-johnston-press|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=21 June 2014|date=28 April 2014}}</ref>

The newspaper backed a 'No' vote in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on Scottish independence]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland-s-decision-the-scotsman-s-verdict-1-3537857 |title=Scotland's decision – The Scotsman's Verdict |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=10 September 2014 |access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref>

In November 2018, Johnston Press filed for [[Administration (law)|administration]].  Shortly after filing for administration, the company was bought out by [[JPIMedia]].<ref name="buy out">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-46241931 |title=Johnston Press: News Letter owner bought over by new company |date=17 November 2018 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref>
