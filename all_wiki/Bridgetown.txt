The present-day location of the city was established by English settlers in 1628; a previous settlement under the authority of Sir [[William Courten]] was at [[Holetown|St. James Town]]. Bridgetown is a major [[Caribbean|West Indies]] tourist destination, and the city acts as an important financial, informatics, convention centre, and [[cruise ship]] [[Port of Bridgetown|port of call]] in the Caribbean region.

==History==
Although the island was totally abandoned or uninhabited when the British arrived, one of the few traces of indigenous pre-existence on the island was a primitive bridge constructed over the [[Constitution River|Careenage]] area's swamp at the centre of Bridgetown.  It was thought that this bridge was created by a people indigenous to the [[Caribbean]] known as the [[Tainos]]. Upon finding the structure, the British settlers began to call what is now the Bridgetown area ''Indian Bridge''.  Scholars widely believe that the Tainos were driven from Barbados to the neighbouring island of [[Saint Lucia]], during an invasion by the [[Kalinagos]], another indigenous people of the region. Eventually after 1654 when a new bridge was constructed over the Careenage by the British, the area became known as ''The Town of Saint Michael'' and later as ''Bridgetown'', after Sir [[Tobias Bridge]].

Bridgetown is the only city outside the present United States that [[George Washington]] visited. ([[George Washington House (Barbados)|George Washington House]], the house where he stayed, is included within the boundaries of the [[Garrison Historic Area]].) Two of Washington's ancestors, Jonathon and Gerrard Hawtaine, were early planters on the island.  Their grandmother was Mary Washington of Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, England. In 2011, historic buildings in Bridgetown were designated as a protected area by UNESCO.<ref>{{cite news|title=Guard our heritage|author=Staff writer|url=http://www.barbadosadvocate.com/newsitem.asp?more=editorial&NewsID=18426|newspaper=[[The Barbados Advocate]]|date=29 June 2011|access-date=3 July 2011|quote=The World Heritage Committee (WHC) determined that historic Bridgetown and its Garrison fulfil the following roles: 1) “exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design; 2) bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisation which is living or which has disappeared; 3) be an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates (a) significant stage(s) in human history.”|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326082214/http://www.barbadosadvocate.com/newsitem.asp?more=editorial&NewsID=18426|archive-date=26 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Early settlement===

[[File:Pg012 Bridgetown in Barbados.jpg|thumb|[[Bridgetown, Barbados]] in 1848]]

English settlement of Bridgetown began on 5 July 1628<ref name="Historic Bridgetown settlement" /> under [[Charles Wolverstone]], who brought with him 64 settlers to these lands formally [[Proprietary colony#Proprietary colonies in the Caribbean|claimed]] by [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|James Hay, the Earl of Carlisle]]. Wolverstone had been sent by a group of London merchants, headed by Sir [[Marmaduke Rawdon]]. They had been granted a lease<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carrington |first1=Sean |last2=Fraser |first2=Henry |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |year=2003 |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean |isbn=0-333-92068-6 |pages=185–186 |chapter=Settlement of Barbados }}<!--|accessdate=1 January 2010 --></ref> to {{convert|10000|acre|ha}} of land by the Earl of Carlisle in settlement of debts. Wolverstone granted each of the settlers {{convert|100|acre|ha}} of land on the northern side of the Careenage waterway for the purpose of general settlement.<ref name="Historic Bridgetown settlement">{{cite book |last1=Alleyne |first1=Warren |title=Historic Bridgetown |year=1978 |publisher=[[Barbados National Trust|The Barbados National Trust]] |pages=7, 8 |chapter=I "The Beginning" }}</ref> The southern shore on Needham's Point was claimed by Carlisle's agents in October 1628. In 1631, many acres of land directly facing [[Carlisle Bay]] were passed to [[Henry Hawley (governor)|Henry Hawley]], the new Governor; but after reports of his dishonest behaviour he was arrested and [[Rendition (law)|forcibly returned]] to England in 1639. An investigation by a commission in 1640 found that much of Hawley's land transactions were legitimate and properly showed{{clarify|date=January 2019}} these lands (including the town site) as being attributed to the Earl of Carlisle. Bridgetown was built with a street layout resembling early English medieval or market towns, with its narrow serpentine street and alley configuration.

=== From town to city ===
{{See also|Districts of Barbados#City of Bridgetown}}
In 1824, Barbados became the seat of the Anglican [[Diocese of Barbados]] and the [[Leeward Islands]]. The St Michael's Parish Church became a cathedral, so that Bridgetown became a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]]. In 1842, Barbados, Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada, Saint Vincent, and Saint Lucia were split into separate dioceses by [[Royal Letters Patent]] which also decreed that the Town of Bridgetown should be called the City of Bridgetown.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=20146 |date=30 September 1842 |page=2631 }}</ref>

From 1800 until 1885, Bridgetown was the main seat of Government for the former British colonies of the [[Windward Islands]]. During this period, the resident [[Governor of Barbados]] also served as the [[Colonial heads of the Windward Islands|Colonial head of the Windward Islands]]. After the Government of Barbados officially exited from the Windward Islands union in 1885, the seat was moved from Bridgetown to [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]] on the neighbouring island of [[Grenada]].

[[File:Bridgetown coa.gif|right|thumb|The Coat of Arms of Bridgetown]]
In December 1925, a committee sought to petition the King for a Royal Charter of Incorporation to provide local government in the city, proposed to consist of a mayor, 8 aldermen, 12 common councillors, a town clerk, a head-borough or chief constable, and such other officers as would be deemed necessary. It was proposed that the island's [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] should seek to incorporate the city instead of using a [[Royal Charter]].

This proposal did not succeed, but in 1958 the Local Government Act was passed in Barbados. This provided a separate administration for the city, with a mayor; 6 city aldermen; and 12 city councillors, four for each of the three wards in the city.

On 20 September 1960, the [[College of Arms]] in London granted arms to the City of Bridgetown. The armorial bearings were designed by the late Neville Connell, the then director of the Barbados Museum and Historical Society, and H. W. Ince, the Honorary Secretary of the Society.

[[Districts of Barbados|Local government]] in Barbados did not last long. In April 1967, the Local Government Councils were dissolved and replaced by an Interim Commissioner for Local Government. The Corporation of Bridgetown thus ceased to exist, and its records and paraphernalia were deposited in both the Government Department of Archives and Barbados Museum and Historical Society.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Alleyne |first=Warren |year=1978 |title=Historic Bridgetown |publisher=[[Barbados National Trust|The Barbados National Trust]] |location=Barbados}}</ref> Today, Bridgetown and surrounding constituencies are administered by members of the Barbadian parliament.

==Geography and climate==

===Geography===
[[File:Bridgetown aerial.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of Bridgetown]]
As established in the early 17th century, Bridgetown's centre was originally composed of a [[swamp]], which was quickly drained and filled-in to make way for the early development.

=== Boundaries ===
The earliest boundaries of Bridgetown are contained by way of an Act passed on 4 April 1660 called, "to prevent the danger which may happen by fire, in or about any of the seaport towns of the Island".<ref name="Historic Bridgetown settlement" /> The southern limit was declared to be the River (Careenage), whilst the western limit was declared to be the western boundary of St. Michael's (now St. Mary's) Churchyard, and extending in a direct line to the seaside.  The town's other limits consisted of properties of certain citizens' names in this statute, the location of which cannot now be determined with certainty.<ref name="Historic Bridgetown settlement" />  The boundaries were not redefined until 1822.

Through Statutory Instrument (S.I) 1984 No. 141, Road Traffic Act, CAP. 295, ROAD TRAFFIC REGULATIONS, and under Schedule Sec. No. 6: The Boundaries of Bridgetown, Speightstown, Holetown and Oistin are cited as follows: 1) "City of Bridgetown" - "Bridgetown" - "The City":<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://208.109.177.6/en/showdoc/cr/1984_141/se:105?splitmode=true#Pd61946487e5056 |title=Road Traffic Act |access-date=17 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218090249/http://208.109.177.6/en/showdoc/cr/1984_141/se:105?splitmode=true#Pd61946487e5056 |archive-date=18 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Beyond the boundary outlined, the wider Greater Bridgetown metropolitan area technically occupies most of the parish of Saint Michael, an area which covers around 39&nbsp;km² (15 sq. mi). The above portion for the Road Traffic Act also omits much of the 90 acres of new land originally formed by completion of the Port of Bridgetown in 1961.

=== Careenage ===
At the heart of Bridgetown is the Careenage and [[Constitution River]]. The Careenage can be considered a [[marina]] for boaters entering or exiting the inner basin located directly in front of the Parliament buildings of Barbados. This body of water provides the city with direct access from medium-sized [[yacht]]s or [[Pleasure craft|small craft]] boats.  Although moderately shallow, the Careenage slices Bridgetown into two parts.  During the rainy season the Constitution River flows into the Careenage area and acts as an outflow for water from the country's interior [[storm drain]]age network.  Flowing into the Carlisle Bay on the southwest coast of the island.

===Climate===
Bridgetown features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]], with relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year.  While fairly hot, Bridgetown is cooled somewhat by the trade winds that affect weather in Barbados in general. Bridgetown's record high of {{convert|33.1|°C|1}} in September 2005 and record low of {{convert|16.5|°C|1}} on January 2, 1984.<ref name=BMS/> Bridgetown features distinct [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season|dry]] seasons, with a relatively lengthy wet season and a shorter dry season. Its wet season is from June through January, while the dry season covers the remaining months.

===Harbour===
{{Main|Port of Bridgetown}}
The Bridgetown Port (or "[[Deep Water Harbour]]" as it is also known) is the major port of entry for cruise and cargo ships docking in Barbados.  The Deep Water Harbour lies a short distance across Carlisle Bay northwest of the Careenage Canal.  Found along the Princess Alice Highway, and west of the city's centre around [[Fontabelle, Saint Michael, Barbados|Fontabelle]].

The Harbour port acts as one of the major shipping and [[transhipment]] hubs from international locations for the entire Eastern Caribbean.  Recently, the Bridgetown Port was dredged to allow safe access and berthing for the new league of "super cruise ships". The dredging project was completed in 2002 and the city can now host many of the largest cruise ships in the world.

The port of ''Bridgetown'' also handles goods for the domestic needs of the island.  The island's main exports of mainly agricultural products also make use of the harbour facilities.

''Bridgetown'' also has a smaller canal in the centre of the city, named the Careenage, a.k.a. "Constitution River". The Constitution River should not be confused with the Deep Water Harbour. The smaller Constitution River feeding into the west coast lies about a half kilometre south of the large harbour.  The Careenage is just large enough for pleasure craft or fishing boats and has two main bridges near the city center which span the shallow Careenage.

==Society and culture==

Bridgetown serves as a principal centre of commercial activity in Barbados, as well as a central hub for the island's public transport system.  Many of the [[Ministries and Agencies of the Barbados Government|ministries and departments]] of the island's government are located within the Greater Bridgetown area.  The Public Buildings or [[Parliament of Barbados|parliament]], which stand at the heart of the city directly north of Heroes Square, house the third oldest continuous parliament in the [[British Empire|British Commonwealth]].  Indeed, at one point in the city's early history, Bridgetown was the most important city of all British possessions in the New World due to the city's easterly location in the Caribbean region.

The headquarters of the [[National Library Service of Barbados]] is located in Bridgetown. The main branch is found on Coleridge Street, in a coral-stone building, built in the style of the [[English Renaissance]].

For a city of its size, the Greater Bridgetown area is home to several prestigious educational institutions. The city serves as the seat of one of the three campuses of the [[University of the West Indies]] in the northern suburb of [[Cave Hill, Saint Michael, Barbados|Cave Hill]]. The campus sits on a bluff offering views of Bridgetown and its port. The [[Barbados Community College]] is located three miles (5&nbsp;km) east of the Central Business District in a suburb known as "The Ivy", while the sprawling campus of the [[Samuel Jackman Prescod Polytechnic]] is located just beyond the eastern limits of the city in a suburb known as "[[The Pine, Saint Michael, Barbados|The Pine]]". In addition, the city houses such distinguished secondary schools as [[Harrison College (Barbados)|Harrison College]], [[Combermere School|Combermere]] and The St. Michael School.

The City of Bridgetown also played host to the 1994 United Nations Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Islands States. Bridgetown has branches of some of the largest banks in the world and English-speaking Caribbean and is internationally recognised as an emerging financial domicile. The city underwent considerable redevelopment in preparation for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cricket Cup]] Finals held at the historic [[Kensington Oval]]. The stadium was renovated to a state-of-the-art sports facility accommodating 30,000 spectators. Live viewership for the 2007 event was estimated to be over 100 million people worldwide.<ref>Mukherjee, Sharmistha.
