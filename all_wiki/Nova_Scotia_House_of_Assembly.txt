The '''Nova Scotia House of Assembly''' ({{lang-fr|Chambre d'assemblée de la Nouvelle-Écosse}}; {{lang-gd|Taigh Seanaidh Alba Nuadh}}), or Legislative Assembly, is the [[deliberative assembly]] of the [[General Assembly of Nova Scotia]] of the province of [[Nova Scotia]], Canada. The assembly is the oldest in Canada, having first sat in 1758,<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/parl_gov_print-e.asp How Canadians Govern Themselves<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and in 1848 was the site of the first [[responsible government]] in the [[British Empire]]. Bills passed by the House of Assembly are given royal assent by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia]]<ref>Constitution Act, 1867, ss. 69 & 88; [http://www.nslegislature.ca/ Nova Scotia House of Assembly]</ref> in the name of the [[Monarchy in Nova Scotia|Queen]].

Originally (in 1758), the Legislature consisted of the Crown represented by a governor (later a lieutenant governor), the appointed '''[[Nova Scotia Council]]''' holding both executive and legislative duties and an elected House of Assembly (lower chamber). In 1838, the council was replaced by an '''executive council''' with the executive function and a '''[[Legislative Council of Nova Scotia|legislative council]]''' with the legislative functions based on the House of Lords.  In 1928, the Legislative Council was abolished and the members pensioned off.

There are 51 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs) representing 51 [[:Category:Nova Scotia provincial electoral districts|electoral districts]].  (With the next general election, there will be 55 electoral districts.<ref>Chapter 32 of Nova Scotia Acts of 2019</ref>) Members nearly always represent one of the three main political parties of the province: the [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party]], [[Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia|Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia]], and [[Nova Scotia New Democratic Party]].

The assembly meets in [[Province House (Nova Scotia)|Province House]]. Located in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] Province House is a National Historic Site and Canada's oldest and smallest legislative building. It opened on February 11, 1819. The building was also the original home to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and the location of the [[Libel trial of Joseph Howe|"Freedom of the Press" trial of Joseph Howe]]. Its main entrance is found on Hollis Street in Halifax.
