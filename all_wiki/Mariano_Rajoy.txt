'''Mariano Rajoy Brey''' ({{IPA-es|maˈɾjano raˈxoj|lang}}; born 27 March 1955) is a Spanish politician who served as [[Prime Minister of Spain]] from 2011 to 2018, when a [[2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy|vote of no confidence]] ousted his government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/3354293/0/votacion-mocion-censura-rajoy-directo/|title=Rajoy: "Ha sido un honor haber sido presidente y dejar una España mejor de la que encontré" |website=20 minutos|language=es|access-date=1 June 2018|date=June 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=lamoncloa.gob.es|language=es|title=Relación cronológica de los presidentes del Consejo de Ministros y del Gobierno |url=http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/presidente/presidentes-desde-1823/Paginas/index.aspx |access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref> On 5 June 2018, he announced his resignation as [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] leader.<ref>{{Cite news|date=5 June 2018|url=http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2018/06/05/5b16558ce2704ec8278b45de.html|title=Rajoy se va: "Es lo mejor para mí, para el PP y para España" |work=El Mundo|language=es|access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=5 June 2018|url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2018-06-05/rajoy-comite-ejecutivo-partido-popular-congreso-sanchez_1574137/|title=Rajoy dimite como presidente del PP: "Es lo mejor para mí, para el partido y para España" |work=El Confidencial|language=es|access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref>

Rajoy was a Minister under the [[José María Aznar]] administration, occupying different leading roles in different Ministries between 1996 and 2003, and he also was the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Spain|Deputy Prime Minister]] between 2000 and 2003. He was the Leader of the Opposition between 2004 and 2011 under [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]'s government.

Rajoy's first term was heavily marked by the [[2008–present Spanish financial crisis|Spanish financial crisis]] and oversaw a major restructuring of the Spanish financial system as well as a major labour reform. The financial crisis peaked with a bailout of the Spanish banking system in June 2012. [[Unemployment in Spain]] peaked at 27% in 2012, which led to an initial drop of the People's Party in the polls, which was aggravated by the revelations of a series of corruption cases that seriously damaged the party's reputation. This, among other factors, led to a profound shift in the Spanish party system, with the rise of new political parties from the left and the right: [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] and [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]].

The [[2015 Spanish general election|2015 general election]] led to a parliamentary configuration that made the formation of a government very difficult; as a result, Spain was without a government for over six months and new elections were held in [[2016 Spanish general election|June 2016]]. Rajoy was finally appointed Prime Minister with the support of the [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]] party and the abstention of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]. Rajoy's second term was marked by economic recovery and a drop in unemployment and the challenge of stagnating salaries. Rajoy also oversaw the [[2017–18 Spanish constitutional crisis]] marked by the Catalan independence referendum of 2017 and the [[Catalan declaration of independence|Catalan unilateral declaration of independence]] on 27 October 2017 that led to the imposition of direct rule in Catalonia.

At 14 years and 146 days, Rajoy was the longest-serving Spanish politician in the [[Government of Spain]] since the [[Spanish transition to democracy]], having held ministerial offices continuously from 1996 to 2004 and from 2011 to 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|date=21 January 2018|url=https://www.elespanol.com/espana/politica/20180121/rajoy-convierte-politico-tiempo-lleva-muerte-franco/278722798_0.html|title=Rajoy se convierte en el político que más tiempo lleva en el poder desde la muerte de Franco|work=El Español|language=es|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=30 May 2018|url=https://www.elplural.com/politica/de-cuando-rajoy-ya-dejo-la-politica-por-una-mocion-de-censura_128973102|title=De cuando Rajoy ya dejó la política por una moción de censura|work=El Plural|language=es|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Born 27 March 1955 in [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[Province of A Coruña|A Coruña]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]],<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.abc.es/20111224/estilo-gente/abci-marianito-presidente-201112240015.html Marianito, el niño que llegó a ser presidente (Marianito, the child who became president)]</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3201363.stm |title=Spanish right chooses new leader |work=bbc.co.uk |date=2 September 2003}}</ref> Rajoy is the grandson of [[Enrique Rajoy|Enrique Rajoy Leloup]], one of the architects of the [[Galician Statute of Autonomy (1936)]] (''Estatuto de autonomía de Galicia''), who was removed from university teaching by the [[Franco dictatorship]] in the early 1950s. He is the son of Olga Brey López and [[Mariano Rajoy Sobredo]], a jurist, and president of the Provincial Court of [[Pontevedra]], the city where he grew up.

Later on, his father was transferred to [[León, Spain|León]] and the whole family moved there. He was duly enrolled, together with his brothers Luis and Enrique, and spent ten years there before moving to the Jesuit school in [[Vigo]]. After finishing secondary school he started university, enrolling in the Law Faculty in Santiago de Compostela.

Rajoy graduated from the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thebusinessyear.com/ecuador-2014/stronger-together/guest-speaker |title=GUEST SPEAKER Mariano Rajoy Stronger Together |publisher=www.thebusinessyear.com |date=February 2014}}</ref> and passed the competitive examination required in Spain to enter into the civil service, becoming the youngest-ever property [[Recorder of deeds|registrar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/4304f0ba-5efc-11e2-9f18-00144feab49a.html#axzz2Pu8qIrH6 |title=Spanish PM insists his reform programme will begin to bear fruit this year |author=Tom Buck, Lionel Barber |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=15 January 2013}}</ref>

He was assigned to [[Padrón]] (A Coruña), [[Villafranca del Bierzo]] ([[province of León|León]]) and [[Santa Pola]] ([[province of Alicante|Alicante]]), a position he still holds. In that year, Rajoy sustained facial injuries in a traffic accident. Since then, he has always worn a beard to cover the scars from these injuries.

Rajoy married Elvira "Viri" Fernández Balboa on 28 December 1996, in La Toja island (Pontevedra). The couple have two children.

While on the campaign trail in 2011, Rajoy published his autobiography, ''En Confianza'' (''In Confidence'').

== Political career ==

=== Early political career ===
Earlier member of the [[Spanish National Union]] (UNE),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Prada Rodríguez|first=Julio|year=2004|title=Orígenes y gestión del proceso autonómico gallego|issn=0212-6559|journal=Anales de Historia Contemporánea|volume=20|publisher=[[University of Murcia|Ediciones de la Universidad de Murcia]]|location=Murcia|url=http://revistas.um.es/analeshc/article/viewFile/55321/53301|page=242}}</ref> Rajoy joined the right-wing party [[People's Alliance (Spain)|People's Alliance]] (AP), becoming a deputy in the inaugural legislature of the [[Galician Parliament]] in 1981. In 1982, he was appointed by [[President of the Xunta de Galicia|Galician regional President]], [[Xerardo Fernández Albor]], as Minister of Institutional Relations of the [[Xunta de Galicia]]. On 11 June 1986, Rajoy was elected President of the Provincial Council of [[Pontevedra]], a position he held until July 1991.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [[Faro de Vigo]]: [http://www.losgenoveses.net/Rajoy/ideas/Rajoy.Faro%20de%20Vigo%2004.03.83.pdf Mariano Rajoy: Igualdad humana y modelos de sociedad (Human equality and social models)]</ref><ref>{{in lang|es}} [[Faro de Vigo]]: [http://www.losgenoveses.net/Rajoy/ideas/Rajoy.Faro%20de%20Vigo.24.07.84.pdf Mariano Rajoy: La envidia igualitaria (Egalitarian Envy)]</ref><ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://laradiodelsur.com/?p=56385 Mariano Rajoy en 1983: "la desigualdad natural del hombre viene escrita en el código genético" ("Natural inequality of man is written in the genetic code")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102190749/http://laradiodelsur.com/?p=56385 |date=2 January 2014 }}</ref>

In the [[1986 Spanish general election|General Elections]] of 22 June 1986, he won a seat in the Congress of Deputies as the head of the AP's list for [[Pontevedra (Congress of Deputies constituency)|Pontevedra]], although he resigned in November to take up the post of vice-president of the Xunta of Galicia following the resignation of Xosé Luis Barreiro and the rest of the ministers. He occupied this latter position until the end of September 1987. In May 1988 he was elected General Secretary of the PA in Galicia during an extraordinary congress of the regional party.

When in 1989 the AP merged with other parties to form the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP), with [[Manuel Fraga]] as its president, Rajoy was named a member of its National Executive Committee and delegate for Pontevedra. He was reelected to parliament in 1993. Before the PP's triumph in the 1996 elections, he was a PP-designated member of the Commission of Parliamentary Control of the [[RTVE]].

In April, the former president of Castile and León and presidential candidate of the government general elections in 1989, [[José María Aznar]], was elected president of the PP. Confirmed in the National Executive, Mariano Rajoy was appointed deputy secretary general of the party. He was re-elected in Pontevedra in the election on 6 June 1993.

=== Ministerial career (1996–2003) ===
On 3 March 1996, the PP won the [[1996 Spanish general election|early parliamentary elections]] and formed a government with the support of the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (EAJ-PNV), [[Convergence and Union]] (CiU) and the [[Canarian Coalition]] (CC). Rajoy, a long-time associate of newly elected Prime Minister José María Aznar, made the move into national politics in Aznar's first government when he was appointed Minister of Public Administration on 6 May. His term was marked by the adoption, in 1997, of the Law on organization and operation of the general administration of the State (LOFAGE), which regulates the organization and functions of central government, and the Law on Government.

He changed his portfolio on 20 January 1999 and replaced [[Esperanza Aguirre]] as [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Minister of Education and Culture]]. Just after his appointment, he was reelected vice-secretary general of the PP during its thirteenth national conference.

In 2000 he led the People's Party election campaign for the elections on 12 March, in which they won absolute majority. On 28 April 2000, Rajoy was appointed Senior Vice President of Government and Minister of the Presidency.

Less than a year later, on 28 February 2001, he replaced [[Jaime Mayor Oreja]], candidate for President of the Government of the Basque Country, as Interior Minister. In this role, he passed legislation including the Organic Law on the right of association, approved the decree implementing the Organic Law on the rights and duties of foreigners, and presented the draft law on the prevention of alcoholism.

In the major cabinet reshuffle of 9 July 2002, he became minister of the presidency, retained his vice presidency and was appointed spokesman of the government. In his new role, he faced two very difficult times of Aznar's second term: the [[Prestige oil spill|Prestige oil tanker disaster]] off the coast of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and the participation of Spain in the [[Iraq War]], at the request of [[George W. Bush]].

Approached, with [[Rodrigo Rato]] and Jaime Mayor Oreja, to succeed José Maria Aznar at the direction of the PP and as presidential candidate of the government in the 2004 general elections, he was chosen as future PP leader on 1 September 2003 and left the government two days later.

=== Leader of the People's Party ===
On 30 August 2003, Aznar announced that he would retire from politics in the 2004 elections and proposed Rajoy as his successor. Rajoy was elected Secretary General of the party the following day, and led the party into the [[2004 Spanish general election|2004 elections]]. However, the PP's large lead evaporated in the wake of the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|11-M bombings]], and the PP was heavily defeated by the PSOE.

However, Rajoy was not held responsible for the defeat, and was elected party president at the PP's 14th congress in October 2004.

=== Leader of the Opposition (2004–2011) ===

==== 2004 election ====
[[File:Rajoy.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Mariano Rajoy during a party meeting in Bilbao, 2005]]
On 11 March 2004, three days before the [[2004 Spanish legislative election|2004 general elections]], [[Madrid]] was struck by [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|terrorist attacks]], which the government initially blamed on the armed Basque separatist organisation, [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. Aznar's government and government party leaders insisted on accusing ETA of the attacks, and on 13 March, Rajoy claimed to believe this because he was convinced of their will and capability for committing such crimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2004/03/13/espana/1606169.html |title=Ahora sería bueno que hubiera un gobierno con mayoría absoluta|work=El Mundo  |access-date=21 November 2011|language=es}}</ref> The government was accused of attempting to blame ETA for the attacks in order to stay on track to win the elections (as they were favored to do), but then the [[PRISA|Prisa]] center-left media company broke news that Al‑Qaida, rather than ETA, was responsible.

On 14 March 2004 the PSOE, under the leadership of [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], won the elections with a majority of 1,300,000 votes over the PP, and obtained 164 deputies, while the PP obtained 9,763,144 votes but 148 deputies, 35 less than they obtained in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&province= |title=Election Resources on the Internet: Elections to the Spanish Congress of Deputies – Results Lookup |publisher=Electionresources.org |access-date=8 June 2012}}</ref> Rajoy was elected for the province of [[Madrid (Congress of Deputies constituency)|Madrid]].

On 1 December 2005, Rajoy survived a helicopter accident, along with Madrid Regional Government President [[Esperanza Aguirre]]; he broke a finger in the accident.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/01/madrid.crash/ CNN.com – Opposition leader survives Madrid helicopter crash – 1 December 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205020019/http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/01/madrid.crash/ |date=5 December 2005 }}</ref>

His criticisms of the [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero|Zapatero]] administration were focused on what he perceived as:
* The derogation of ambitious plans of the previous executive
* The ''Plan Hidrológico Nacional'' (National Hydrological Plan)
* The ''LOCE'' Organic Law on the Quality of Education
* The alleged "unnecessary" statutory reforms which devolved competences to the autonomous communities, such as submitted in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]], and [[Andalusia]]n referendums with low turn-outs. According to Rajoy, some of those reforms constituted concealed changes of the autonomous communities towards a confederation, endangering the integrity of the State
* Zapatero's view of Spain, which, Rajoy proposed, would require a reform of the [[Spanish Constitution]]. Such a reform that would need approval in a national referendum.
* The alleged weakness facing the peace process opened as a result of the permanent ceasefire declared by ETA on 30 December 2006, broken by the [[2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing|Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing]] and arms robbery
* The legalization of [[Abortion in Spain|abortion]] until 14 weeks of pregnancy, a law that Mariano Rajoy considered "criminal" and against the will of large sectors of the Spanish society
In [[foreign policy]]:
* The alleged cold relations with United States and [[Poland]].
* The alliances with Latin American left-wing leaders: [[Hugo Chávez]], from [[Venezuela]], [[Fidel Castro]], from [[Cuba]] and [[Evo Morales]], from [[Bolivia]].

==== 2008 election ====
Rajoy faced a serious situation within his party when he came under public pressure from the electorally successful [[Alberto Ruiz Gallardón]] (Madrid's Mayor) to be included in the PP&nbsp;lists for the [[2008 Spanish general election|March 2008 general election]]. Gallardón represents a more centrist sector within the party, whereas Rajoy, [[Angel Acebes]] and [[Eduardo Zaplana]] are widely accepted{{Vague|date=March 2008}} as representing a more conservative wing of the party, closer to Aznar{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. Rajoy's final decision was to leave Gallardón out of the list for those elections, an action which provoked concern about the alienation of potential PP voters. Some experts and newspapers even argued that it could cost Rajoy the elections{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. In any case, the power struggle for succession created a tense situation for him and for the party.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crawford |first=Leslie |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a00a6290-c451-11dc-a474-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 |title=Madrid mayor barred by own party |work=Financial Times |date=17 January 2008 |access-date=8 June 2012}}</ref>

On 30 January 2008, Rajoy received the support of Germany's [[Angela Merkel]] and France's [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] for the March 2008 general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elimparcial.es/contenido/2087.html |title=Sarkozy y Merkel desean de "todo corazón" el triunfo de Mariano Rajoy |publisher=Elimparcial.es |date=30 January 2008 |access-date=21 November 2011|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/videos/espana/Sarkozy/Merkel/le/desean/gran/exito/Rajoy/elpvidnac/20080130elpepunac_12/Ves/ |title=Video: Sarkozy y Merkel le desean "un gran éxito" a Rajoy |work=El País  |date=30 January 2008 |access-date=21 November 2011|language=es}}</ref> The PP was defeated in the general election, however, it gained votes and seats, and Rajoy continued to lead his party in opposition.

==== 2011 election ====
The [[2011 Spanish general election|2011 general election]] campaign was dominated by economic issues. "Election campaign begins, crushed by the economic situation", was the headline in ''[[El Pais]]'' on 2 September 2011;{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} the same day, ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' claimed that "the unemployment election campaign [had begun]".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The high rate of unemployment was a major issue in the campaign. Close to 5&nbsp;million people were out of work at the time of the election, and 1.5&nbsp;million households had no wage earners.

Rajoy slammed Spain's unemployment rate as "unbearable and unacceptable" as data showed 4,350 people per day losing their jobs in October 2011. The Socialists, he said, "did not know how to manage [[Spain's economy]], and now the Spanish people are paying the price for that".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He promised he would shepherd Spain out of its [[crisis]] and recover the shaky confidence of international investors and reduce the government's ominously high borrowing costs. The [[Greek government-debt crisis|debt crisis in Greece]] had raised concerns over the solvency of other weak economies like Spain. The PP&nbsp;campaign slogan called on voters to "Join the change!" and the party manifesto stressed its commitment to cutting the country's budget deficit in line with EU requirements. It proposed tax breaks for savers and small firms who hired staff; benefits for those who took on young employees; more flexible labour contracts and wage negotiations and major cuts in [[red tape]], to encourage entrepreneurs to set up businesses. At the same time, it pledged to protect public healthcare and education, saving money through efficiency and better management.

{{Main|Premiership of Mariano Rajoy}}

===First term (2011–2015)===
[[File:Secretary Kerry Meets With Spanish President Rajoy at the Moncloa Palace in Madrid (22114902899).jpg|thumb|Prime Minister Rajoy meets with U.S. Secretary of State [[John Kerry]]]]
In November 2011, Rajoy's right-wing [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] won its biggest majority since the country's return to representative democracy in the 1970s, securing 186 out of the 350&nbsp;seats in the lower house of Parliament. Voters turned to him in hopes of alleviating the pain of [[European sovereign-debt crisis|Europe's debt crisis]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Following the [[2011 Spanish general election|general election]] held in 2011, Rajoy was elected Prime Minister by the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] on 20 December 2011.

====Inauguration====
Rajoy, designated candidate for Prime Minister of the government of [[King Juan Carlos&nbsp;I]], appeared before the Congress of Deputies on 19 December 2011. He stated that to achieve the objective of a deficit of 4.4% of GDP in 2012, an investment of €16,500,000,000 would be needed. He added that his only increased public spending would be the revaluation of pensions, beginning 1 January 2012, and that he would not create any new jobs in the public sector, except for security forces. He stated an intention "to reduce the size of the public sector" and also wanted to reform [[Public holidays in Spain|public holidays]] so as to avoid encouragement of popular four-day weekends. This would be accomplished by incorporating the use of the nearest Monday for most public holidays. He also announced his desire to end the practice of early retirement.

Rajoy was chosen by Parliament two days later with 187 votes in favor, 149 votes against and 14 abstentions, receiving the support of the People's Party, the Forum of Asturias (FAC) and the Navarrese People's Union (UPN), with Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE), Convergence and Union (CiU), the United Left (IU) and Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD) dissenting. The Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), the coalition Amaiur and the Canary Coalition (CC) abstained. He was appointed a few hours later as Prime Minister by Juan Carlos&nbsp;I and sworn in the next day at the [[Zarzuela Palace]], before the King and Queen, Zapatero, the outgoing Prime Minister, and the Presidents of the Cortes Generales, and others.

====First days====
Rajoy's government was formed on 21 December 2011 with thirteen ministers—the lowest number in Spanish democratic history. [[Soraya Saenz de Santamaria]], Vice President of the Government, Minister of the Presidency, and government spokesperson, and [[Ana Pastor Julián]], Minister of Equipment, were appointed. The Ministries of Culture, Science, and Territorial Policy were ended, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance was split into two new ministries. The Ministry of Agriculture and Environment was kept intact, despite statements made by Rajoy speech before Congress that indicated the opposite intention. Among the ministers, [[Cristóbal Montoro Romero]], Minister of Finance, and [[Miguel Arias Cañete]], Minister of Agriculture, Food and Environment, had been members of the previous Aznar government and continued to occupy the same posts.

====Spending cuts====

{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
On 30 December 2011, the [[Cabinet of Spain|Council of Ministers]] approved a cuts plan (called an austerity plan) amounting to €8,900,000,000 in savings and €6,200,000,000 in new revenues. Salaries of public workers were frozen, the workweek in public administration was reduced to 37.5 hours, and recruitment of new public employees was halted, except in the areas of security, health and education. A programme which provided rent assistance for young people was abolished, and the [[minimum wage]] was frozen—something that had not happened since 1966. The [[income tax]] and tax on [[Spanish property bubble|real estate]] was also increased for 2012 and 2013. Pensions were adjusted up 1%, however, and the tax deduction for the purchase of homes was reinstated. The premium of €400 for the long-term unemployed (due to a lack of industry) at the end of law was maintained but only for those registered as jobseekers with the public employment service for at least twelve months out of the previous eighteen and whose income amounts were less than three quarters of the net minimum wage.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2012/08/24/espana/1345829064.html]</ref> A 4% [[value-added tax]] was expanded to include new home purchases.

====Lawsuit====
On 4 January 2013 the association Democracia Real Ya (DRY), created after the 15 May 2011 protest movement, brought charges against Mariano Rajoy and another 62 deputies (including four ministers) before the [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]], accusing them of diversion of public funds and misappropriation. Mariano Rajoy was accused of receiving a subsistence allowance despite the fact that he was living in the [[Palace of Moncloa|Moncloa Palace]] in [[Madrid]]. The lawsuit before the Supreme Court was a consequence of the data which had appeared in the media providing information about several deputies who had houses in [[Madrid]] but at the same time were receiving extra funds for lodging. According to the association DRY, these representatives, who could be lodged at no cost to the public purse, were paid a monthly subsistence allowance valued at €1,823.36. Furthermore, if they had been elected by the constituency of Madrid and had a house in this city, they were allowed €870 a month to cover accommodation and food expenses resulting from the exercise of their functions that, with respect to Rajoy, were already covered – from the state budget – in the Moncloa Palace. DRY therefore accused them of diversion of public funds and misappropriation. Additionally, DRY demanded that they return all the money that didn't belong to them, particularly bearing in mind that "the cuts are making most Spaniards' life a misery".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://imagenes.publico.es/resources/archivos/2013/1/4/1357312359258Querella.pdf|title= Querella contra Rajoy|work=Público  |access-date=4 January 2013|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.publico.es/448356/la-asociacion-dry-se-querella-contra-63-diputados-que-perciben-dietas-teniendo-casa-en-madrid|title="Democracia Real Ya" se querella contra Rajoy |work=Público  |access-date=4 January 2013|language=es}}</ref>

On 24 April 2013, having found no irregularity in the existing regulation and discarding the existence of constituents elements of offense, the [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]] rejected the lawsuit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/04/24/actualidad/1366812496_106535.html  |title= El Supremo rechaza la querella de DRY contra Rajoy y 62 diputados |work=El País |access-date=28 April 2013|language=es}}</ref>

[[File:Protesta en contra del Partido Popular ante su sede en la calle Génova de Madrid (1 de febrero de 2013) (2).jpg|thumb|Demonstration in front of the People's Party headquarters protesting against the Barcenas' affair (2 February 2013).]]
The newspaper ''[[El País]]'' published in its edition of 30 January 2013 a series of documents, under the title of "[[Luis Bárcenas|Bárcenas]]' secret papers", referring to the accounts of the conservative party from 1999 to 2009. According to those hand-written documents, Mariano Rajoy and [[María Dolores de Cospedal]] had received extra payments in "black" money from the former treasurer of the People's Party, Luis Bárcenas.
These documents state that both Bárcenas and his predecessor, [[Álvaro Lapuerta]], managed cash donations from businessmen and private builders (three of whom are additionally accused in the Gürtel case), cited as sources of undeclared income of the PP. Expenditure included, apart from allocations for the effective functioning of the party, payments made to members of the leadership of the party during those years with no explicitly stated purpose.
Barcenas' accounts show yearly payments of 25,200 euros for 11 years to the President, in addition to smaller amounts for a total estimated at 33,207 with purposes such as "Mariano's suits", "Mariano's ties", or "M.R.'s suits". PP Secretary-General María Dolores de Cospedal appears in the papers of these payments, as well as other leaders, such as former ministers [[Javier Arenas (politician)|Javier Arenas]], [[Jaime Mayor Oreja]] and [[Francisco Álvarez-Cascos]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/politica/rajoy-cospedal-cobraban-sobresueldos-barcenas-segun-pais-2307076|title=The newspaper ''El País'' publishes documents from the People's Party former treasurer Bárcenas that set out payments to the leadership of the People´s Party |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 30 January 2013|work= El Periódico|publisher= elperiodico.com |access-date=4 February 2013|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/01/30/actualidad/1359583204_085918.html|title=Bárcenas' papers |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 30 January 2013|work= El País|publisher= elpais.com |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elcomercio.es/20130203/mas-actualidad/nacional/rajoy-barcenas-papeles-201302031430.html |title=Rajoy and the Bárcenas case |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 3 February 2013|work= El Comercio|publisher= elcomercio.es |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>

The sentence also recognised that it was proven that the PP had a [[slush fund]] since 1989, consisting of a "financial and accounting structure that was parallel to the official one".<ref name="EM"/> More court rulings are pending, as this ruling only covered the 1999-2005 period of the Gürtel scandal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elespanol.com/espana/tribunales/20180508/primera-sentencia-gurtel-ts-confirma-carcel-correa/305720071_0.html |title=Primera sentencia firme del caso Gürtel: el TS confirma 13 años de cárcel para Correa |publisher=Elespanol.com |access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref>

Following the court ruling, the leader of [[Spanish Socialist Workers Party|PSOE]], [[Pedro Sánchez]], promoted a [[motion of no confidence]] against Rajoy to be voted on Friday, 1 June. 176 votes were needed to get it approved.

=== Social issues ===

==== Immigration ====
Rajoy declared himself a strong supporter of allowing migrants to enter Spain, saying Spain would support those seeking [[Asylum seeker|asylum]]. In 2015, he criticised the [[Third Orban Government|Hungarian government]] for taking steps to deter migration into their country.<ref>{{cite news|title=Spanish PM says disagrees with immigration policies in Hungary|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-spain/spanish-pm-says-disagrees-with-immigration-policies-in-hungary-idUSKCN0RM0O520150922|access-date=3 November 2017|work=[[Reuters]]|date=2015}}</ref> Despite making these statements, the [[Second Rajoy Government|Government of Rajoy]] was highly criticized for taking anti-immigration measures such as cutting budget to immigration observatories,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Álvarez|first1=Pilar|title=El PP apaga los observatorios de la inmigración y contra el racismo|url=https://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/03/16/actualidad/1426535560_383528.html|access-date=3 November 2017|agency=[[El País]]|date=16 March 2015|language=es}}</ref> and the reinforcement of the fence of [[Melilla]], with highly criticised "hot returns" - the illegal expulsion of migrants by the police without any legally established procedures or meeting the international obligations - with police violence eventually taking place. These acts were condemned by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] and the [[United Nations|UN]].<ref>{{cite news|title=La ONU vuelve a pedir a España el fin de las 'devoluciones en caliente'|url=http://www.elboletin.com/noticia/155551/nacional/la-onu-vuelve-a-pedir-a-espana-el-fin-de-las-devoluciones-en-caliente.html|access-date=8 November 2017|work=El Boletin|date=6 November 2017|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Estrasburgo condena a España por dos devoluciones en caliente en Melilla|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20171003/431771029772/espana-devolucion-caliente-tribunal-derechos-humanos.html|access-date=3 November 2017|work=[[La Vanguardia]]|date=3 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Ferrer Arambarri|first1=Laura|title=José Palazón: "En ninguna frontera se practica tanta violencia policial como en la valla de Melilla"|url=http://www.diariodeibiza.es/cultura/2017/02/17/frontera-practica-violencia-policial-valla/896915.html|access-date=3 November 2017|agency=Diario de Ibiza|date=18 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Hot returns.

==== Bullfighting ====
Rajoy is a strong supporter of [[bullfighting]]. He has said that "the tradition is an art form deeply rooted in Spanish history". He lifted the ban on live bullfights on state-run television and they are once again shown in the traditional 6&nbsp;pm slot on [[Televisión Española|TVE]].<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19487931 | title = Live bullfights return to Spanish TV after six-year ban | access-date = 7 September 2012}}</ref>

==== History ====
During the 2015 election campaign, Rajoy asserted that the PP “was the only party defending the unity of Spain.” Among his electoral promises was the creation of a National Museum of Spanish History intended to “defend the unity of Spain.”  The location chosen for making this announcement left little doubt about the nationalist undertones of that proposal: the site of the [[Battle of Covadonga]], in the northwestern region of [[Asturias]]. That battle is recognized as the first triumph by Christian military forces after the Muslim conquest of the Iberia Peninsula in 711–718. As befits this accomplishment, historians usually consider Covadonga as the site of the beginning of the [[Reconquista]], or the “reconquest” of the Iberian Peninsula by Christian rulers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/spain/2018-02-05/why-spanish-nationalism-rise|title=Why Spanish Nationalism Is on the Rise|first=Omar G.|last=Encarnación|date=5 February 2018|access-date=2 June 2018|via=www.foreignaffairs.com}}</ref>

==== Gibraltar ====
Rajoy wants British-controlled [[Gibraltar]] returned to Spain.<ref>"[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/spain-protests-over-camerons-surprise-visit-to-gibraltar-f7rv6r8rr Rajoy furious at Cameron’s surprise visit to Gibraltar]". ''The Sunday Times.'' 16 June 2016.</ref> He described Gibraltar as an “anachronism”, and “the last colony in Europe”.<ref>"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-referendum-brexit-would-hit-gibraltar-says-chief-minister-fabian-picardo-but-spain-can-stick-a7055501.html EU Referendum: Gibraltar chief minister says Spain can stick joint sovereignty 'where the sun doesn’t shine']". ''The Independent.'' 29 May 2016.</ref>

==== Scottish independence ====
[[Scotland]] held a [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on independence from the United Kingdom on Thursday 18 September 2014]]. In November 2013, Rajoy stated that an independent Scotland would have to reapply for membership of the [[European Union]], causing considerable irritation to the devolved [[Scottish Government]] and criticism that Rajoy was interfering in the internal affairs of another state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25132026|title=Scottish independence: Mariano Rajoy says Scotland would be 'outside EU'|work=BBC News}}</ref> Relations between the Spanish and devolved Scottish governments deteriorated further when the Scottish Government alleged that Rajoy invited a senior UK official to visit Madrid allegedly to co-ordinate British and Spanish opposition to the independence movements in Scotland and [[Catalonia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/salmond-spain-is-working-with-uk-to-thwart-yes-vote.23013356|title=Salmond: Spain is working with UK to thwart Yes vote|work=Herald Scotland}}</ref>

=== Anti-egalitarianism ===
During his early political life, Rajoy defended [[anti-egalitarian]] stances. In 1983, as the youngest member of the Parliament of Galicia, Rajoy wrote in a piece in the ''[[Faro de Vigo]]'' titled "Human equality and models of society" the notion that "all policies seeking to achieve equality were a fallacy".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Amat|author-link=Jordi Amat Fusté|first=Jordi|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/opinion/20180603/444025749994/en-el-origen-de-rajoy.html|journal=[[La Vanguardia]]|date=3 June 2018|title=En el origen de Rajoy}}</ref> As he wrote a year later in another piece for the ''Faro de Vigo'' titled "La envidia igualitaria" ("The egalitarian envy", 24 July 1984), when he was already president of the Provincial Deputation of Pontevedra: "Biological equality is not possible. But social equality isn't either. [...] As it is demonstrated in an undeniable way that nature, as hierarchic, engenders all human unequal, let's avoid exploiting envy and resent laying down the egalitarian dictatorship on such negative impulses".<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Miguel|last=Roig|url=https://www.eldiario.es/zonacritica/esperanza-vida-Mariano-Rajoy_6_231386878.html|journal=[[eldiario.es]]|date=22 September 2014|title=La esperanza de vida de Mariano Rajoy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author-link=Ana Pardo de Vera|first=Ana|last=Pardo de Vera|url=https://www.publico.es/politica/rajoy-negaba-1984-existiera-igualdad.html|journal=[[Público (Spain)|Público]]|title=Rajoy negaba en 1984 que existiera la igualdad y tildaba de 'envidiosos' a los que la defendían|date=27 June 2013}}</ref>
