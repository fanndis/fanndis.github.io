'''Half-mast''' ([[British English|British]] and [[Australian English]]) or '''half-staff''' ([[American English]]) refers to a flag flying below the summit of a ship mast, a pole on land, or a pole on a building. In many countries this is seen as a symbol of [[respect]], [[mourning]], [[distress signal|distress]], or, in some cases, a [[salute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/xf-half.html|title=Flags at half mast}}</ref> Most English-speaking countries use the term ''half-mast'' in all instances. In the United States, this refers officially only to flags flown on ships, with ''half-staff'' used on land.<ref>{{cite web|title=Half-Staff versus Half-Mast: Which is correct?|url=https://www.collinsflags.com/blog/archives/flag-etiquette/half-staff-versus-half-mast-which-is-correct|publisher=CollinsFlags.com|accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref>

When hoisting a flag that is to be displayed at half-mast, it should be raised to the [[finial]] of the pole for an instant, then lowered to half-mast. Likewise, when the flag is lowered at the end of the day, it should be hoisted to the finial for an instant, and then lowered.<ref name=flagco/>

==Australia==
[[File:AU NavalEnsignHalfMast.JPG|thumb|The [[Australian White Ensign]] flying at half-mast. In accordance with British tradition, the flag is flying only one flag's width below the top of the pole.]]

Recent examples include the death of naturalist [[Steve Irwin]], actor [[Heath Ledger]], esteemed international opera singer [[Dame Joan Sutherland]], and former Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]]. In the case of cricketer [[Phillip Hughes]], who died after being struck by a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] during a [[Sheffield Shield]] [[cricket]] match, the Australian flag was flown at half-mast at [[Cricket NSW]] headquarters on 27 November 2014 – the day of his death,<ref name=FitzSimons>{{cite news |last1=FitzSimons |first1=Peter |title=There is a way Phillip Hughes' proud legacy can live on |url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/there-is-a-way-phillip-hughes-proud-legacy-can-live-on-20141127-11vkrm.html |accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> as well as on the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]<ref name=Knox>{{cite news |last1=Knox |first1=Malcolm |title=Phillip Hughes a cut above the rest |url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/phillip-hughes-a-cut-above-the-rest-20141128-11w397.html |accessdate=28 November 2014 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=28 November 2014}}</ref> and at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] in London.<ref name="Lord's">{{cite news |title=Phillip Hughes: Tributes flow from international community as flags fly at half-mast at Lord's |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-28/phillip-hughes-tributes-flow-from-international-community/5924122 |accessdate=1 December 2014 |issue=ABC News |date=28 November 2014}}</ref>
*At times of natural disaster such as [[bushfires in Australia|bushfires]] or tragedy.

In Australia and other Commonwealth countries, merchant ships "dip" their ensigns to half-mast when passing an RAN vessel or a ship from the navy of any allied country.

==Bangladesh==

The [[flag of Bangladesh]] flew at half-mast on the national mourning day 15 August, the day in which Father of the nation [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|Bangobandhu Sheikh Mujibor Rahman]] was murdered with some of his family members by a group of military officers. The national flag is also kept half hoisted on 21 February which is recognised as International Mother's Language Day to pay homage to the martyrs of [[Bengali language movement|Language Movement]] in 1952 which took place to establish ‘[[Bengali language|Bangla]]’ as the state Language of the then East Pakistan (present [[Bangladesh]]).

==Canada==<!-- This section links from [[flag of Canada]] -->
The term half-mast is the official term used in Canada, according to the Rules For Half-Masting the National Flag of Canada. The decision to fly the flag at half-mast on federal buildings rests with the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]]. Federally, the [[flag of Canada|national flag of Canada]] is flown at half-mast to mark the following occasions:

Some examples include [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], [[Memorials and services for the September 11 attacks|11 September 2002]], the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]], the 2005 [[Mayerthorpe tragedy]], the [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II|death of Pope John Paul II]], the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London bombings]], the death of [[Ernest Smith|Smokey Smith]], the [[state funeral]]s of former [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] [[death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan]] and [[death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|Gerald Ford]], the death of [[Jack Layton]], and the [[2020 Nova Scotia attacks]].<ref name="half mast">{{Cite web |accessdate=31 March 2008 |url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/occasion_e.cfm |title=Rules for Half-masting the National Flag of Canada |publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421101709/http://canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/occasion_e.cfm |archive-date=21 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Guardian2">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/nova-scotia-shooting-friends-family-pay-tribute-victims|title=Nova Scotia shooting: friends and family pay tribute to 'beautiful souls' lost in rampage|publisher=The Guardian|last=Cecco|first=Leyland|date=April 20, 2020|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>

There are, however, exceptions to the rules of half-masting in Canada: if [[Victoria Day]] or [[Canada Day]] fall during a period of half-masting, the flags are to be returned to full-mast for the duration of the day. The national flag on the Peace Tower is also hoisted to full mast if a foreign [[head of state]] or [[head of government]] is visiting the parliament. These exemptions, though, do not apply to the period of mourning for the death of a [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]]. The [[Queen's Personal Canadian Flag|Royal Standard of Canada]] also never flies at half-mast, as it is considered representative of the sovereign, who ascends to the throne automatically upon the death of his or her predecessor. Each province can make its own determination of when to fly the flag at half-mast when provincial leaders or honoured citizens pass away.

To raise a flag in this position, the flag must be flown to the top of the pole first, then brought down halfway before the flag is secured for flying. When such mourning occurs, all flags should be flown at that position or not be flown at all, with the exception of flags permanently attached to poles.<ref>{{Cite news |accessdate=31 March 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1901/01/23/archives/grief-in-canada-flags-at-half-mast-everywhere-and-amusement-places.html |title=Flags at Half Mast Everywhere and Amusement Places Closed. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 January 1901}}</ref>

On 2 April 2008, the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] voted in favour of a motion calling on the government to reinstate the former policy regarding the half-masting of the flag on federal buildings. The motion, however, was not binding and the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] refused to recommend any revision in policy to the Governor General. At the same time, a federal advisory committee tabled its report on the protocol of flying the national flag at half-mast, recommending that the Peace Tower flag remain at full height on days such as the Police Officers National Memorial Day and the National Day or Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, stating that the flag should only be half-masted on Remembrance Day. At last report, the committee's findings had been forwarded to the House of Commons all-party heritage committee for further study.<ref>{{Cite web |accessdate=13 April 2008 |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=c5b3fc64-8830-4269-92e6-e23c5473400d&k=66747 |title=Conservatives lose flag vote |publisher=[[CanWest Global Communications]] |date=2 April 2008 |author=Greenaway, Norma |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618045816/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=c5b3fc64-8830-4269-92e6-e23c5473400d&k=66747 |archivedate=18 June 2008 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/realproperty/text/pubs_ceremonial/page7-e.html Public Works and Government Services Canada: Ceremonial Procedures] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070620021036/http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/realproperty/text/pubs_ceremonial/page7-e.html |date=20 June 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/etiquette/2_e.cfm Department of Canadian Heritage: Rules for Flying the Flag]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/occasion_e.cfm|title=Canada.ca|first1=Government of Canada, Service Canada, Citizen Service Branch, Digital Service Directorate, Web|last1=Channel|first2=Gouvernement du Canada, Service Canada, Direction générale de service aux citoyens, La Direction du service numérique, Services|last2=Web|website=www.canadianheritage.gc.ca|access-date=23 June 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421101709/http://canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/occasion_e.cfm|archive-date=21 April 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==China==
[[File:National mourning for 2008 Sichuan earthquake victims - Tiananmen Square, Beijing, 2008-05-19 (Cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese flag at half-mast to mark to mourn for the victims of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]].]]

The National Flag Law provides for a number of situations on which the flag should be flown at half-mast, and authorizes the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] to make such executive orders:
*On the death of the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], [[Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]], [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], [[Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], and those who have made major contributions to the People's Republic of China, or to world peace or advancement of the mankind. For example, the flag was flown at half-mast after the deaths of [[Zhou Enlai]] (1976), [[Zhu De]] (1976), [[Mao Zedong]] (1976), [[Soong Ching-ling]] (1981), [[Hu Yaobang]] (1989), [[Li Xiannian]] (1992), [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1997), [[Yang Shangkun]] (1998), [[Qiao Shi]] (2015), [[Wan Li]] (2015) and [[Li Peng]] (2019), as well as death of foreigners such as [[Joseph Stalin]] (1953), [[Patrice Lumumba]](1961), [[Charles de Gaulle]](1970) and [[Norodom Sihanouk]] (2012).
*When major disasters happen, such as when the flag was flown at half-mast from 19 to 21 May 2008, the three national mourning days for the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], as well as at 4 April 2020 ([[Qingming Festival]]) as the national mourning day for the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

==Denmark==
[[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] is nationally flown at half-mast in Denmark as a sign of mourning.
It is performed by raising the flag briefly to the top of the mast and lowering it approximately one-third of the length of the flagpole.

==Finland==
In Finland, the official term for flying a flag at half-mast is known as ''suruliputus'' (''mourning by flag(ging)''). It is performed by raising the flag briefly to the top of the mast and lowering it approximately one-third of the length of the flagpole, placing the lower hoist corner at half-mast. On wall-mounted and roof-top flagpoles the middle of the flag should fly at the middle of the flagpole. When removing the flag from half-mast, it is briefly hoisted to the finial before lowering.

Traditionally, private residences and apartment houses fly the national flag at half-mast on the day of the death of a resident, when the flag is displayed at half-mast until sunset or 21:00, whichever comes first. Flags are also flown at half-mast on the day of the burial, with the exception that the flag is to be hoisted to the finial after the inhumation takes place.

Flags are also to be flown at half-mast on the days of national mourning. Such days are the deaths of former or current [[President of Finland|Finnish presidents]], as well as significant catastrophic events such as the aftermath of [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], [[2011 Norway attacks]] and significant national events such as the 2004 [[Konginkangas bus disaster]] and school shootings of [[Jokela school shooting|Jokela]] and [[Kauhajoki school shooting|Kauhajoki]].

Historically, flags were flown at half-mast on the [[Commemoration Day of Fallen Soldiers]] which takes place on the third Sunday of May. Originally, flag was raised to the finial in the morning, displayed at half-mast from 10:00 to 14:00, and again raised to the finial for the rest of the day. In 1995, the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, the tradition of flying the flag at half-mast was discontinued and flag is displayed at the finial in a usual manner.

==France==
The [[French flag]] is flown half mast on any Day of Mourning by order of the government (for example after the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' attack]] on 7 January 2015, the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|Paris attacks]] on 13 November 2015, and the [[2016 Nice truck attack|Nice attack]] on 14 July 2016). Other countries have also flown the French flag at half mast because of this too. (Australia's Sydney Harbour Bridge flew the French flag at half mast because of the Paris attacks on 13 November 2015).

Some occurrences of the French flag being flown half mast have been controversial, especially after the death of [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/roland-garros/article/2005/04/04/drapeaux-en-berne-et-le-deuil-du-pape_635227_1616946.html|title=Drapeaux en berne et le deuil du pape|website=Le Monde.fr}}</ref> but also in a lesser measure at the time following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in March 1953.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2013/12/06/01016-20131206ARTFIG00356-drapeaux-en-berne-un-honneur-rare-pour-une-personnalite-etrangere.php|title=Drapeaux en berne : un honneur rare pour une personnalité étrangère|date=6 December 2013}}</ref>

==Germany==
[[File:Land-bw-g.jpg|thumb|Black ribbons indicate mourning on banners that cannot be lowered to halfmast]]

The [[flag of Germany]] and the flags of its federal states are flown at half-mast:
*On 27 January, [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day|Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism]];
*On National Day of Mourning (33rd Sunday of [[Ordinary Time]]).
*On any day of mourning by order of the [[President of Germany|federal president]] for all of Germany, or by order of a [[Minister-President#Germany|minister president]] for a particular state. E.g. upon the death of a current or former ranking politician or person of high esteem, or multiple deaths in accidents or natural disasters.
{{-}}

==Greece==
According to Law 851/1978, the only day specified on which the [[flag of Greece|Greek flag]] is flown at half-mast is [[Good Friday]]. Also, on other national and public mourning days.

==Hong Kong==
[[File:Flags at half-staff in GBS.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong SAR flag flown at half mast]]

Similar rules as in China apply for Hong Kong. See [[flag of Hong Kong#Half-mast|Flag of Hong Kong]] for details. Prior to the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] in 1997, the rules for flying the flag at half-mast were the same as the British ones.
*The HKSAR flag was flown at half-mast on 24–26 August 2010, for the fatalities of the Hong Thai Travel tourists in the [[2010 Manila hostage crisis]].
*The national flag of the PRC was also flown at half-mast on 26 August in Hong Kong.
*The HKSAR flag was flown at half-mast on 4–6 October 2012, for the [[2012 Lamma Island ferry collision|Lamma Ferry Accident]] victims in which 39 people died.

The [[flag of India]] is flown at half-mast for the death of a [[President of India|President]], [[Vice President of India|Vice-President]], or [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]], all over India.

For a Minister of State, it is flown only in Delhi. For a Governor, Lt. Governor, or Chief Minister of a state or union territory, it is flown in the concerned state.

If the intimation of the death of any dignitary is received in the afternoon, the flag shall be flown at half-mast on the following day also at the place or places indicated above, provided the funeral has not taken place before sunrise on that day. On the day of the funeral of a dignitary mentioned above, the flag shall be flown at half-mast at the place of the funeral. For example, on 17 March 2019, The Government of India declared a National Day of mourning on 18 March 2019 due to the death of the Chief Minister of Goa, Manohar Parrekar on 17 March 2019. This means, that on 18 March 2019, the Indian National Flag must be at half-mast in the National Capital i.e. New Delhi and in the capital cities of all the 29 states and Union Territories.

In the event of a halfmast day coinciding with the [[Republic Day]], [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]], National Week (6 to 13 April), any other particular day of national rejoicing as may be specified by the [[Government of India]], or, in the case of a state, on the anniversary of formation of that state, flags are not permitted to be flown at half-mast except over the building where the body of the deceased is lying until it has been removed and that flag shall be raised to the full-mast position after the body has been removed.

Observances of State mourning on the death of foreign dignitaries are governed by special instructions issued from the Ministry of Home Affairs (Home Ministry) in individual cases. However, in the event of death of either the Head of the State or Head of the Government of a foreign country, the Indian Mission accredited to that country may fly the national flag on the above-mentioned days.

The [[flag of Turkey]] is flown at half-mast throughout Turkey every 10 November, between 09:05 and the sunset, in memory of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], who died on 10 November 1938 at five past nine in the morning. At other times, the government may issue an order for the national flag to be flown at half-mast upon the death of principal figures of the Turkish political life as a mark of respect to their memory (such as [[Turgut Özal]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sabah.com.tr/yasam/2018/12/31/hangi-durumlarda-milli-yas-ilan-edilir|title=Hangi durumlarda milli yas ilan edilir?|website=Sabah|language=tr|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> When such an order is issued, all government buildings, offices, public schools and military bases are to fly their flags at half-mast.

To show the sympathy of Turkish people to a foreign leader, such as after the deaths of [[Yasser Arafat]] or [[Pope John Paul II]], flags are also flown at half-mast by governmental order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.haber7.com/guncel/haber/21629-turkiyede-bayraklar-yarin-yariya-inecek|title=Türkiye'de bayraklar yarın yarıya inecek|first=|date=|website=Haber7|language=tr|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/papa-icin-bayraklar-yariya-indirilecek-309913|title=Papa için bayraklar yarıya indirilecek|first=|date=|website=www.hurriyet.com.tr|language=tr|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>  The flag at the Grand National Assembly in Ankara is never lowered to half-mast, regardless of the occasion.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.milligazete.com.tr/haber/1003690/tbmm-ve-anitkabirde-bayraklar-neden-yariya-indirilmedi|title=TBMM ve Anıtkabir‘de bayraklar neden yarıya indirilmedi|website=Milli Gazete|language=tr|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> The flag at Anıtkabir, the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of Turkey, is only lowered to half-mast on 10 November.<ref name=":0" /> At those times when the flag is to be flown at half-mast, it must first be raised to full height, then lowered to half-mast.

== United Arab Emirates ==
The flag of the United Arab Emirates is flown at half mast on 30 November ([[Commemoration Day|Martyrs' Day]]) of every year from 08:00 to 11:30. The flag is also flown at half mast by decree of the [[President of the United Arab Emirates]] usually for three days. Each of the seven Emirs has the right to order flags to be flown at half mast in his Emirate.

==United Kingdom==

The [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]], the flag of the British monarch, is never flown at half-mast, because there is always a living monarch: the throne passes immediately to the successor.

There was some controversy in the United Kingdom in 1997 following the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] that no flag was flying at half-mast at [[Buckingham Palace]]. However, customarily the only flag to fly from Buckingham Palace was the Royal Standard when the sovereign was in residence at the Palace (or, exceptionally, after the death of the sovereign, the flag of the next senior member of the Royal Family would be raised, if the new sovereign were not present); otherwise, no flag would fly.

In response to public outcry<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1560640/Royal-Family-learnt-lesson-over-Princess-Diana.html |title=Royal Family learnt lesson over Princess Diana |accessdate=18 March 2012 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Andrew |last=Pierce |date=18 August 2007}}</ref> that the palace was not flying a flag at half mast, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] ordered a break with protocol, replacing the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]] with the [[Union Flag]] at half-mast as soon as the Queen left the Palace to attend [[funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|the Princess's funeral]] at [[Westminster Abbey]]. The Royal Standard was again flown (at full hoist) on her return to the Palace. Since then, the Union Flag flies from the Palace when the Queen is not in residence, and has flown at half mast upon the deaths of members of the Royal Family, such as [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|the Queen Mother]] in 2002 and other times of national mourning such as following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|terrorist bombings in London on 7 July 2005]].

In the UK, the correct way to fly the flag at half-mast is two-thirds between the bottom and top of the flagstaff, with at least the width of the flag between the top of the flag and the top of the pole according to the [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]], which decides the flying, on command of the Sovereign. The flag may be flown on a government building at half-mast on the following days:
*From the announcement of the death up to the funeral of the Sovereign, except on [[Proclamation Day]] when flags are hoisted to full-mast, from 11{{nbsp}}am until sunset;
*The funerals of members of the royal family, upon command of the Sovereign;
*The funerals of foreign rulers, upon command of the Sovereign;
*The funerals of prime ministers and ex-prime ministers of the UK, upon command of the Sovereign;
*Other occasions, by special command of the Sovereign.

According to the [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]], the correct term is Half Mast.<ref>See ''Flying Flags in the United Kingdom: a Guide to Britain's Flag Protocol''</ref>

If a flag-flying day coincides with a day of half-mast flying (including that for the death of a member of the royal family), the flag is flown at full-mast unless a specific command is received from the Sovereign.

If more than one flag is flown on a half-mast day, they must all be flown at half-mast, or not flown at all. The flag of a foreign nation must never be flown at half-mast on UK soil unless that country has declared mourning.<ref name="FlagInstitute">{{cite web|title=Flying Flags in the United Kingdom – A Guide to Britain's Flag Protocol|url=https://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/Flying_Flags_in_the_United_Kingdom.pdf|website=Flag Institute|publisher=The Flag Institute/The Flags & Heraldry Committee|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>

==United Nations==
At the [[United Nations]] offices in New York and Geneva, the [[flag of the United Nations]] flies at half-mast on the day after the death of a Head of State or a Head of Government of a member state, but generally not during the funeral.<ref>[https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/maplib/docs/stsgb132.pdf UN flag code and regulations]</ref> Other occasions are at the Secretary-General's discretion. Other offices may follow local practice. To honor the memory of [[Dag Hammarskjöld]] the UN issued [[postage stamp]]s showing its flag at half-mast.

In the United States, the usual government term for non-nautical use is "half-staff." While the term "half-mast" is commonly used in place of half-staff, U.S. law and post-WW-I military tradition indicate that "half-mast" is reserved to usage aboard a ship, where flags are typically flown from [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], and at naval ships ashore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/68/88/2888.html|title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online – Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510215224/http://www.bartleby.com/68/88/2888.html|archivedate=10 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa-flag-site.org/faq/half-staff.shtml|title=Does a Flag Fly at Half-Staff or Half-Mast?

In the United States, the President can issue an [[executive order (United States)|executive order]] for the [[flag of the United States]] to be flown at half-staff upon the death of principal figures of the United States government and others, as a mark of respect to their memory. When such an order is issued, all government buildings, offices, public schools, and military bases are to fly their flags at half-staff. Under [[United States Flag Code|federal law]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|4|7(f)}}), the flags of states, cities, localities, and pennants of societies, shall never be placed above the flag of the United States; thus, all other flags also fly at half-staff when the U.S. flag has been ordered to fly at half-staff. There is no penalty for failure to comply with the above law as to enforce such a penalty would violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].{{citation needed|reason=Either a link to US code or federal ruling would be useful.  This sentence is currently not supported.|date = June 2016}}

[[Governor#United States|Governors]] of U.S. states and territories are authorized by [[United States Code|federal law]] to order all U.S. and state flags in their jurisdiction flown at half-staff as a mark of respect for a former or current state official who has died, or for a member of the armed forces who has died in active duty. The governor's authority to issue the order is more restricted than the president's, and does not include discretion to issue the order for state residents who do not meet the criteria stated.{{cn|date=December 2020}} Since a governor's executive order affects only his or her state, not the entire country, these orders are distinguished from presidential proclamations.

Under {{UnitedStatesCode|4|7(m)}} and established traditions by Presidential proclamations, the flag of the United States is to be flown at half-staff on rare occasions, in the following circumstances:<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|4|7(m)}}</ref>
*For thirty days after the death of a current, former president, or president-elect.
*For ten days after the death of a current [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], current or retired [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice]], or current [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]].

Federal law includes a Congressional request that the flag be flown at half-staff on [[Peace Officers Memorial Day]] (May 15), unless that day is also [[Armed Forces Day]]. Presidential proclamations also call for the flag to be flown at half-staff on [[Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day]] (December 7),<ref>{{cite press release |title=National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2007 |publisher=White House |date= 4 December 2007 |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/12/20071204-9.html |accessdate=16 January 2008}}</ref>

On October 16, 2001, [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] approved legislation requiring the United States flag to be lowered to half-staff on all Federal buildings to memorialize fallen firefighters. {{USPL|107|51}} requires this action to occur annually in conjunction with observance of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service.<ref>{{Cite web |title=National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service |publisher=The Library of Congress |date= 16 October 2001 |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:h.j.res.42: |accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> The date of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service is traditionally the first Sunday in October.

{{UnitedStatesCode|4|7(m)}} was modified with new legislation signed into effect on June 29, 2007, by [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]], requiring any federal facility within a region, which proclaims half-staff to honor a member of the U.S. Armed Forces who died on active duty, to follow the half-staff proclamation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Code Modifications for Half-Staff at a Federal Facility |publisher="When to fly the flag at half mast", gettysburgflag.com |url=http://www.gettysburgflag.com/FlyFlagHalfMast.php |accessdate=4 January 2009}}</ref>

Apart from the lowered position of the [[flag of Vietnam]], [[state funeral|state mourning]] also warrants a [[black ribbon]] 1/10 the width of the flag's width and equal to the length of the flag to be tied at the summit. Variants have the black ribbon wrapped around the flag itself, preventing it from being unfurled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://giaoduc.net.vn/Xa-hoi/Cach-treo-co-ru-Le-tang-Dai-Tuong-Vo-Nguyen-Giap-post129354.gd|title=Cách treo cờ rủ Lễ tang Đại Tướng Võ Nguyên Giáp|last=giaoduc.net.vn|date=6 October 2013}}</ref>
