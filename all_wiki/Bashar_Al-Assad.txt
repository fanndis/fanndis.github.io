'''Bashar Hafez al-Assad''' ({{lang-ar|بَشَّار حَافِظ الْأَسَد‎}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Baššār Ḥāfiẓ al-ʾAsad}}'', <small>[[Levantine Arabic|Levantine]] pronunciation:</small> {{IPA-ar|baʃˈʃaːr ˈħaːfezˤ elˈʔasad|}}; {{Audio|En-us-Bashar Al-Assad from Syria pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg|English pronunciation}}; born 11 September 1965) is a [[Syria]]n politician who has been the 19th [[president of Syria]] since 17 July 2000. In addition, he is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] and regional secretary of [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party's branch]] in Syria. His father, [[Hafez al-Assad]], was the president of Syria before him, serving from 1971 to 2000.

Born and raised in [[Damascus]], Bashar al-Assad graduated from the medical school of [[Damascus University]] in 1988 and began to work as a doctor in the [[Syrian Army]]. Four years later, he attended postgraduate studies at the [[Western Eye Hospital]] in London, specialising in [[ophthalmology]]. In 1994, after his elder brother [[Bassel al-Assad|Bassel]] died in a car crash, Bashar was recalled to Syria to take over Bassel's role as [[heir apparent]]. He entered the military academy, taking charge of the [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|Syrian military presence in Lebanon]] in 1998.

Assad's father, Hafez, was born to an impoverished rural family of [[Alawites|Alawite]] background and rose through the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-led faction)|Ba'ath Party]] ranks to take control of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Syrian branch]] of the Party in the [[1970 Syrian Corrective Revolution|1970 Corrective Revolution]], culminating in his rise to the [[President of Syria|Syrian presidency]].{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2013|p=38}} Hafez promoted his supporters within the Ba'ath Party, many of whom were also of Alawite background.{{sfn|Zisser|2007|p=20}}<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |title=Hafez al-Assad |last1=Seale |first1=Patrick |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=15 June 2000 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/jun/15/guardianweekly.guardianweekly1 |access-date=19 March 2011}}</ref> After the revolution, Alawite strongmen were installed while [[Sunni]]s, [[Druze]]s, and [[Ismaili]]s were removed from the army and Ba'ath party.{{sfn|Moosa|1987|p=305}}

=== Rise to power: 1994–2000 ===
Soon after the death of Bassel, Hafez al-Assad decided to make Bashar the new [[heir apparent]].{{sfn|Zisser|2007|p=35}} Over the next six and a half years, until his death in 2000, Hafez prepared Bashar for taking overpower. Preparations for a smooth transition were made on three levels. First, support was built up for Bashar in the military and security apparatus. Second, Bashar's image was established with the public. And lastly, Bashar was familiarised with the mechanisms of running the country.{{sfn|Leverett|2005|p=61}}

To establish his credentials in the military, Bashar entered the [[Homs Military Academy|military academy at Homs]] in 1994 and was propelled through the ranks to become a colonel of the elite [[Syrian Republican Guard]] in January 1999.<ref name=Ladno />{{sfn|Zisser|2007|p=30}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0006/10/bn.01.html |title=CNN Transcript – Breaking News: President Hafez Al-Assad Assad of Syria Confirmed Dead |publisher=CNN |date=10 June 2000 |access-date=3 August 2010}}</ref> To establish a power base for Bashar in the military, old divisional commanders were pushed into retirement, and new, young, Alawite officers with loyalties to him took their place.{{sfn|Ma'oz|Ginat|Winckler|1999|p=41}}

In 1998, Bashar took charge of Syria's [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|Lebanon file]], which had since the 1970s been handled by Vice President [[Abdul Halim Khaddam]], who had until then been a potential contender for president.{{sfn|Ma'oz|Ginat|Winckler|1999|p=41}} By taking charge of Syrian affairs in Lebanon, Bashar was able to push Khaddam aside and establish his own power base in Lebanon.{{sfn|Zisser|2007|p=34–35}} In the same year, after minor consultation with Lebanese politicians, Bashar installed [[Emile Lahoud]], a loyal ally of his, as the [[President of Lebanon]] and pushed former [[Lebanese Prime Minister]] [[Rafic Hariri]] aside, by not placing his political weight behind his nomination as prime minister.{{sfn|Blanford|2006|p=69–70}} To further weaken the old Syrian order in Lebanon, Bashar replaced the long-serving de facto Syrian [[High Commissioner]] of Lebanon, [[Ghazi Kanaan]], with [[Rustum Ghazaleh]].{{sfn|Blanford|2006|p=88}}

Parallel to his military career, Bashar was engaged in public affairs. He was granted wide powers and became head of the bureau to receive complaints and appeals of citizens, and led a campaign against corruption. As a result of this campaign, many of Bashar's potential rivals for president were put on trial for corruption.<ref name=Ladno>{{cite news |script-title=ru:Асад Башар : биография |trans-title=Bashar Assad: A Biography |url=http://www.ladno.ru/person/asad/bio/ |access-date=23 September 2011 |newspaper=Ladno |language=ru}}</ref> Bashar also became the President of the [[Syrian Computer Society]] and helped to introduce the internet in Syria, which aided his image as a moderniser and reformer.<ref name="facing down rebellion">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10338256 |title=Syrian President Bashar al-Assad: Facing down rebellion |work=BBC News |date=21 October 2015}}</ref>

{{quote|During its decades of rule... the Assad family developed a strong political safety net by firmly integrating the military into the government. In 1970, Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father, seized power after rising through the ranks of the Syrian armed forces, during which time he established a network of loyal Alawites by installing them in key posts. In fact, the military, ruling elite, and ruthless secret police are so intertwined that it is now impossible to separate the Assad government from the security establishment.... So... the government and its loyal forces have been able to deter all but the most resolute and fearless oppositional activists. In this respect, the situation in Syria is to a certain degree comparable to [[Saddam Hussein]]'s strong Sunni minority rule in Iraq.}}

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] has stated that at least 10 European citizens were tortured by the Assad government while detained during the Syrian Civil War, potentially leaving Assad open to prosecution by individual European countries for [[war crime]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-12-15/us-says-europeans-tortured-by-assads-death-machine |title=U.S. says Europeans killed by Assad's death machine |work=Chicago Tribune |agency=Bloomberg News |first1=Josh |last1=Rogin |date=15 December 2014 |access-date=4 January 2015}}</ref> [[Stephen Rapp]], the [[United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues]], has argued that the crimes allegedly committed by Assad are the worst seen since those of [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/fbi-says-europeans-tortured-by-assad-regime |title=FBI says Europeans tortured by Assad regime |first1=Tamar |last1=Pileggi |date=15 December 2014 |access-date=4 January 2015}}</ref> In March 2015, Rapp further stated that the case against Assad is "much better" than those against [[Slobodan Milošević]] of Serbia or [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]] of Liberia, both of whom were indicted by international tribunals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-war-crimes-case-assad-milosevic-29542721 |title=US: War Crimes Case Vs.

In a February 2015 interview with the [[BBC]], Assad described accusations that the [[Syrian Arab Air Force]] used [[barrel bomb]]s as "childish", stating that his forces have never used these types of "barrel" bombs and responded with a joke about not using "cooking pots" either.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/assad-syria-interview-bbc-barrel-bombs-facts-video |title='There are no barrel bombs': Assad's Syria 'facts' |publisher=Channel Four News |date=10 February 2015 |access-date=12 February 2015}}</ref> The BBC Middle East editor conducting the interview, [[Jeremy Bowen]], later described Assad's statement regarding barrel bombs as "patently not true".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-31438916 |title=What does Assad really think about Syria's civil war? |work=BBC News |date=15 February 2014 |access-date=15 February 2015 |last=Bowen |first=Jeremy}}</ref><!--The Syrian Arab Air Force's use of barrel bombs is well documented.--><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-02-04/what-are-barrel-bombs-and-why-syrian-military-using-them |title=What are 'barrel bombs' and why is the Syrian military using them? |publisher=PRI |date=4 February 2014 |access-date=14 February 2015 |last=Bell |first=Matthew}}</ref>

[[Nadim Shehadi]], the director of [[The Fares Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies]], stated that "In the early 1990s, Saddam Hussein was massacring his people and we were worried about the weapons inspectors," and claimed that "Assad did that too.

In September 2015, France began an inquiry into Assad for [[crimes against humanity]], with French Foreign Minister [[Laurent Fabius]] stating "Faced with these crimes that offend the human conscience, this bureaucracy of horror, faced with this denial of the values of humanity, it is our responsibility to act against the impunity of the killers".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/france-opens-war-crimes-inquiry-against-assad-regime-222026549.html |title=France opens probe into Assad regime for crimes against humanity |work=Yahoo News |agency=Agence France-Presse |last1=Talagrand |first1=Pauline |date=30 September 2015 |access-date=1 October 2015}}</ref>

In February 2016, head of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria, [[Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro|Paulo Pinheiro]], told reporters: "The mass scale of deaths of detainees suggests that the government of Syria is responsible for acts that amount to extermination as a crime against humanity." The UN Commission reported finding "unimaginable abuses", including women and children as young as seven perishing while being held by Syrian authorities. The report also stated: "There are reasonable grounds to believe that high-ranking officers—including the heads of branches and directorates—commanding these detention facilities, those in charge of the military police, as well as their civilian superiors, knew of the vast number of deaths occurring in detention facilities ... yet did not take action to prevent abuse, investigate allegations or prosecute those responsible".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/un-probe-accuses-damascus-extermination-detainees-131405484.html |title=UN probe accuses Syria govt of 'exterminating' detainees |work=Yahoo News |agency=Agence France-Presse |last1=Larson |first1=Nina |date=8 February 2016 |access-date=11 February 2016}}</ref>

In March 2016, the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] led by [[New Jersey]] Rep.

In April 2018, an alleged [[Douma chemical attack|chemical attack]] occurred in Douma, prompting the U.S. and its and allies to accuse Assad of violating international laws and initiating the [[2018 bombing of Damascus and Homs]].

Detention centers run by Air Force Intelligence are among the most notorious in Syria, and thousands are believed to have died because of torture or neglect. Charges filed against Hassan claim he had command responsibility over the facilities and therefore knew of the abuse. The move against Hassan marked an important milestone of prosecutors trying to bring senior members of Assad's inner circle to trial for war crimes.

In June 2019, United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense [[Michael Mulroy]] stated that the United States “will respond quickly and appropriately,” if the regime uses chemical weapons again. He added that Bashar al-Assad has done more than any other to destabilize the region by "murdering his own people" and that both [[Russia]] and the Syrian regime have shown no concern for the suffering of the Syrian people creating one of the "worst humanitarian tragedies in history".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carey |first1=Glen |title=U.S. Warns Syrian Forces Against Chemical Weapons in Idlib Fight |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-07/u-s-warns-syrian-forces-against-chemical-weapons-in-idlib-fight |website=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref>

==== Iraq War and insurgency ====
Assad opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] despite a long-standing animosity between the Syrian and Iraqi governments. Assad used Syria's seat in one of the rotating positions on the [[United Nations Security Council]] to try to prevent the invasion of Iraq.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3661134.stm |work=BBC News |title=Iraq war illegal, says Annan |date=16 September 2004 |access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref>

According to veteran U.S intelligence officer [[Malcolm Wrightson Nance|Malcolm Nance]], the Syrian government had developed deep relations with former Vice Chairman of the [[Revolutionary Command Council (Iraq)|Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council]] [[Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri]]. Despite the historical differences between the two Ba'ath factions, al-Douri reportedly urged Saddam to open oil pipelines with Syria, building a financial relationship with the Assad family. After the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, al-Douri allegedly fled to Damascus where he organised the National Command of the Islamic Resistance which co-ordinated major combat operations during the Iraqi insurgency.<ref>{{citation |first=Malcolm |last=Nance |author-link=Malcolm Nance |title=The Terrorists of Iraq: Inside the Strategy and Tactics of the Iraq |date=18 December 2014}}</ref><ref name="An Intelligence Vet Explains ISIS, Yemen, and the Dick Cheney of Iraq">{{cite web |title=An Intelligence Vet Explains ISIS, Yemen, and "the Dick Cheney of Iraq" |url=http://phasezero.gawker.com/an-intelligence-vet-explains-isis-yemen-and-the-dick-1699407909 |date=22 April 2015 |access-date=6 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228125548/http://phasezero.gawker.com/an-intelligence-vet-explains-isis-yemen-and-the-dick-1699407909 |archive-date=28 December 2015}}</ref> In 2009, [[David Petraeus|General David Petraeus]], who was at the time heading the [[United States Central Command]], told reporters from [[Al Arabiya]] that al-Douri was residing in Syria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/12/13/94083.html |title=US giving security support to Yemen: Petraeus |publisher=Al Arabiya |date=13 December 2009 |access-date=30 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051532/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/12/13/94083.html |archive-date=8 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==== Egypt ====
[[Egypt–Syria relations|Diplomatic relations]] with Egypt were re-established in 2005 under his rule. In 1978, his father [[Hafez al-Assad]] severed diplomatic relations with the country after Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] signed a peace treaty with Israel in the [[Camp David Accords]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} However, at the outset of the [[Arab Spring]], Syrian state media focused primarily upon [[Hosni Mubarak]] of Egypt, demonising him as pro-U.S. and comparing him unfavourably with Assad.{{sfn|Sadiki|2014|p=147}} Assad told ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in this same period that he considered himself "anti-Israel" and "anti-West", and that because of these policies he was not in danger of being overthrown.<ref name="haaretz.com" />

Following [[2012 Egyptian presidential election|the election]] of [[Muslim Brotherhood]] politician [[Mohamed Morsi]] as the next Egyptian president, relations became extremely strained. The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] is a banned organisation and its membership is a capital offence in Syria. Egypt severed all relations with Syria in June 2013.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Diplomatic relations were restored and the embassies reopened after Morsi regime was [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|deposed]] just weeks later by current [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]. In July 2013, the two countries agreed to reopen the Egyptian consulate in Damascus and the Syrian consulate in Cairo.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Egypt and Syria to keep consulate relations: FM spokesperson - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online|url = http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/75951/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-and-Syria-to-keep-consulate-relations-FM-spo.aspx|website = english.ahram.org.eg|access-date = 2016-01-18}}</ref>

Although Egypt has not been vocal in support for any sides of Syria's ongoing civil war, [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] said in 2016 that his nation's priority is "supporting national armies", which he said included the [[Syrian Armed Forces]].<ref name="ALJZ">{{Cite news|date=23 November 2016|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/egypt-sisi-expresses-support-syria-military-161123150315176.html|work=al-Jazeera|title=Egypt's Sisi expresses support for Syria's military}}</ref> He also said regarding Egypt's stance in the conflict: "Our stance in Egypt is to respect the will of the Syrian people, and that a political solution to the Syrian crisis is the most suitable way, and to seriously deal with terrorist groups and disarm them".<ref name="ALJZ"/> Egypt's support for a political solution was reaffirmed in February 2017. Egypt's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Ahmed Abu Zeid, said that Egyptian foreign minister [[Sameh Shoukry]], "during his meeting with UN Special Envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, on Saturday confirmed Egypt’s rejection of any military intervention that would violate Syrian sovereignty and undermine opportunities of the standing political solutions.”<ref>{{Cite news|date=17 February 2018|url=https://sana.sy/en/?p=127670|work=SANA|title=Egypt reaffirms support for political solution to crisis in Syria}}</ref>

Egypt has also expressed great interest in rebuilding postwar Syria, with many Egyptian companies and businessmen discussing investment opportunities in Syria as well as participation in the reconstruction effort. Tarik al-Nabrawi, president of Egypt's Engineers Syndicate said that 2018 will witness a “boom and influential role for Egyptian construction companies in Syria and to open the door for other companies — in the electricity, building material, steel, aluminum, ceramics and sanitary material fields among others — to work in the Syrian market and participate in rebuilding cities and facilities that the war has destroyed.”<ref>{{Cite news|date=8 January 2018|url=https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1136936/egypt-eyes-broad-participation-syria%E2%80%99s-reconstruction|work=Asharq al-Awsat|title=Egypt Eyes Broad Participation in Syria's Reconstruction}}</ref> On 25 February 2018, Syrian state news reported that an Egyptian delegation composed of "members of the Islamic and Arab Assembly for supporting Resistance and Future Pioneers movement as well as a number of figures", including Jamal Zahran and Farouk Hassan, visited the Syrian consulate in Cairo to express solidarity with the Syrian government.<ref name=sana>{{Cite news|date=25 February 2018|url=https://sana.sy/en/?p=128613|work=SANA|title=Egyptian delegation visits Syrian consulate to announce solidarity with Syria}}</ref>{{better source|good to get a neutral description not Syrian state version|date=June 2018}}

On March 5, 2005, Assad announced that Syrian forces would begin its withdrawal from Lebanon in his address to the Syrian parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/05/syria.lebanon|title=Assad announces Lebanon troop withdrawal|date=March 5, 2005|publisher=www.theguardian.com|access-date=May 13, 2020}}</ref> Syria completed its full withdrawal from Lebanon on April 30, 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/064/article_35244.asp|title=Retrait syrien total fin avril au plus tar|language=fr}}</ref>
Assad argued that Syria's gradual withdrawal of troops from Lebanon was a result of the assassination of [[Lebanese Prime Minister]] [[Rafic Hariri]].<ref name=Rose /> According to testimony submitted to the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]], when talking to Rafic Hariri at the Presidential Palace in Damascus in August 2004, Assad allegedly said to him, "I will break Lebanon over your [Hariri's] head and over [[Walid Jumblatt]]'s head" if [[Émile Lahoud]] was not allowed to remain in office despite Hariri's objections; that incident was thought to be linked to Hariri's subsequent assassination.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/the-hezbollah-connection.html |title=The Hezbollah Connection |work=The New York Times |date=10 February 2015 |access-date=15 February 2015 |last=Bergman |first=Ronen}}</ref> In early 2015, journalist and ''ad hoc'' Lebanese-Syrian intermediary Ali Hamade stated before the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]] that Rafic Hariri's attempts to reduce tensions with Syria were considered a "mockery" by Assad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2015/Apr-14/294325-assad-considered-hariris-conciliation-a-mockery.ashx |title=Assad considered Hariri's conciliation a mockery |work=The Daily Star |last=Knutsen |first=Elise |date=14 April 2015 |access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref>

Assad's position was considered by some to have been weakened by the withdrawal of Syrian troops from [[Lebanon]] following the [[Cedar Revolution]] in 2005. There has also been pressure from the U.S. concerning claims that Syria is linked to terrorist networks, exacerbated by Syrian condemnation of the assassination of Hezbollah military leader, [[Imad Mughniyah]], in Damascus in 2008. Interior Minister Bassam Abdul-Majeed stated that "Syria, which condemns this cowardly terrorist act, expresses condolences to the martyr family and to the Lebanese people."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7242383.stm |work=BBC News |title=Bomb kills top Hezbollah leader |date=13 February 2008 |access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref>

In May 2015, Lebanese politician [[Michel Samaha]] was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in jail for his role in a terrorist bomb plot that he claimed Assad was aware of.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2015/May-14/297969-assad-knew-about-samaha-plot-video-indicates.ashx |title=Assad knew about Samaha plot, video indicates |work=The Daily Star |date=14 May 2015 |access-date=15 May 2015}}</ref>

==== Arab–Israeli conflict ====
[[File:Golan Heights Map.PNG|thumb|[[Golan Heights]] has been [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied]] and administered [[Golan Heights Law|as part of Israel]] since 1967.]]
The United States, the European Union, the [[March 14 Alliance]], and France accuse Assad of providing support to militant groups active against Israel and opposition political groups. The latter category would include most political parties other than [[Hezbollah]], [[Hamas]], and the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7021986.stm |work=BBC News |title=Assad sets conference conditions |date=1 October 2007 |access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref>

In a speech about the [[2006 Lebanon War]] in August 2006, Assad said that Hezbollah had "hoisted the banner of victory", hailing its actions as a "successful resistance."<ref>{{cite web |last=Rogers |first=Paul |url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/conflict/lebanon_war_3992.jsp |title=Lebanon: the war after the war |publisher=[[openDemocracy.net|openDemocracy]] |date=11 October 2006 |access-date=3 August 2010}}</ref>

In April 2008, Assad told a Qatari newspaper that Syria and Israel had been discussing a peace treaty for a year. This was confirmed in May 2008, by a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]]. As well as the treaty, the future of the [[Golan Heights]] was being discussed. Assad was quoted in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as telling the Qatari paper:
<blockquote>... there would be no direct negotiations with Israel until a new US president takes office. The US was the only party qualified to sponsor any direct talks, [Assad] told the paper, but added that the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] "does not have the vision or will for the peace process. It does not have anything."<ref>{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Walker |author2=News Agencies |title=Olmert confirms peace talks with Syria |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/21/israelandthepalestinians.syria |work=The Guardian |date=21 May 2008 |access-date=21 May 2008 |quote=Israel and Syria are holding indirect peace talks, with Turkey acting as a mediator... |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521213948/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/21/israelandthepalestinians.syria |archive-date=21 May 2008  |url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>

According to [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leaked American cables]], Assad called [[Hamas]] an "uninvited guest" and said "If you want me to be effective and active, I have to have a relationship with all parties. Hamas is Muslim Brotherhood, but we have to deal with the reality of their presence," comparing Hamas to the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood which was crushed by his father, [[Hafez al-Assad]]. He also said Hamas would disappear if peace was brought to the Middle East.<ref>{{cite news |title=Assad: Iran won't attack Israel with nukes |author=Roee Nahmias |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3992202,00.html |newspaper=[[Ynetnews]] |date=30 November 2010 |access-date=12 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Syria's Assad seems to suggest backing for Hamas negotiable, leaked cables say |author=Meris Lutz |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/02/world/la-fg-wikileaks-syria-20101202 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2 December 2010 |access-date=12 December 2010}}</ref>

Assad has indicated that the peace treaty that he envisions would not be the same kind of peace treaty Israel has with Egypt, where there is a legal border crossing and open trade. In a 2006 interview with [[Charlie Rose]], Assad said: "There is a big difference between talking about a peace treaty and peace. A peace treaty is like a permanent ceasefire. There's no war, maybe you have an embassy, but you actually won't have trade, you won't have normal relations because people will not be sympathetic to this relation as long as they are sympathetic with the Palestinians: half a million who live in Syria and half a million in Lebanon and another few millions in other Arab countries."<ref name=Rose>{{cite web |title=An hour with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad |url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/484 |work=[[Charlie Rose (TV show)|Charlie Rose]] |date=27 March 2006 |access-date=5 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128235040/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/484 |archive-date=28 January 2011}}</ref>

During the visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to Syria in 2001, Assad requested an apology to Muslims for the [[Crusades]] and criticised Israeli treatment of Palestinians, stating that "territories in Lebanon, the Golan and Palestine have been occupied by those who killed the principle of equality when they [[Jews as the chosen people|claimed that God created a people distinguished above all other peoples]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/841226/Assad-greets-pope-in-Syria.html |quote="Territories in Lebanon, the Golan and Palestine have been occupied by those who killed the principle of equality when they claimed that God created a people distinguished above all other peoples," the Syrian leader said. |title=Assad greets pope in Syria |website=Deseret News |agency=Associated Press |date=6 May 2001}}</ref> He also compared the suffering of Palestinians at the hands of the Israelis to the suffering endured by [[Jesus]] in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]], and said that "they tried to kill the principles of all religions with the same mentality in which they betrayed Jesus Christ and the same way they tried to betray and kill the Prophet Muhammad".<ref>{{cite news |title=Syria and Judaism: The disappearance of the Jews |url=http://www.economist.com/node/617242 |access-date=1 June 2011 |newspaper=The Economist |date=10 May 2001 |quote=The pope's pilgrimage in the steps of St Paul was widely seen as a success, even if it did not elicit an apology to the Muslim world for the medieval crusades. Syria's president, Bashar Assad, basked in international praise for his religious tolerance. But, notably, this tolerance was not extended to Judaism. Welcoming John Paul, Assad compared the suffering of the Palestinians to that of Jesus Christ. The Jews, he said, "tried to kill the principles of all religions with the same mentality in which they betrayed Jesus Christ and the same way they tried to betray and kill the Prophet Muhammad." The pope was taken on a detour to the town of Quneitra, flattened by the Israelis in their partial withdrawal from the Golan Heights, and called upon to bless the president's vision of a Christian-Islamic alliance to vanquish the common threat of colonising Jews.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Polish experience shaped Pope's Jewish relations |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/obit/pope/polish_experience.html |access-date=7 May 2011 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=April 2005 |quote=The decision to beatify Pius IX, the pope who kidnapped a Jewish child in Bologna and who put Rome's Jews back in their ghetto, was one question mark.

[[File:Ted Kaufman with al-Assad.jpg|thumb|Assad meets with U.S. Senator [[Ted Kaufman]] in 2009]]
Assad met with U.S. scientists and policy leaders during a science diplomacy visit in 2009, and he expressed interest in building research universities and using science and technology to promote innovation and economic growth.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Turekian |first1=Vaughan |title=Beginnings |journal=Science & Diplomacy |date=22 September 2014 |volume=3 |issue=3 |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/editorial/2014/beginnings}}</ref>

In response to [[Executive Order 13769]] which mandated refugees from Syria be indefinitely suspended from being able to resettle in the United States, Assad appeared to defend the measure, stating "It's against the terrorists that would infiltrate some of the immigrants to the West... I think the aim of Trump is to prevent those people from coming," adding that it was "not against the Syrian people".<ref>{{cite news |author=Angus McDowall |work=Reuters |title=Assad says Trump travel ban targets terrorists, not Syria's people |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-assad-usa-idUSKBN15V0N2 |date=16 February 2017}}</ref> This reaction was in contrast to other leaders of countries affected by the Executive Order who condemned it.<ref>{{cite news |author=Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, Martin Chulov and Saeed Kamali Dehghan |work=The Guardian |title=Muslim-majority countries show anger at Trump travel ban |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/muslim-majority-countries-anger-at-trump-travel-ban |date=30 January 2017}}</ref>

In 2018, the [[United Nations]] exposed North Korea for their facilitation of Syria's development of chemical weapons. According to a report by U.N. investigators, North Korea provided the Syrian government with acid-resistant tiles, valves, and thermometers. Additionally, DPRK missile technicians had been seen inside various Syrian chemical weapons facilities. This series of about 40 unreported shipments between North Korea and Syria, on which were the chemical weapons materials as well as prohibited ballistic missile parts, is said to have occurred throughout 2012–2017.

=== Al-Qaeda and ISIL ===
In 2001, Assad condemned the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.israel |title=Blair gets a public lecture on the harsh realities of the Middle East |work=The Guardian |date=1 November 2001}}</ref> In 2003, Assad said in an interview with a Kuwaiti newspaper that he doubted the organization of [[al-Qaeda]] even existed. He was quoted as saying, "Is there really an entity called al-Qaeda? Was it in Afghanistan? Does it exist now?" He remarked about [[Osama bin Laden]], commenting: "[he] cannot talk on the phone or use the Internet, but he can direct communications to the four corners of the world?

Assad's relationship with al-Qaeda and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] has been subject to much attention. In 2014, journalist and terrorism expert [[Peter R. Neumann]] maintained, citing Syrian records captured by the U.S. military in the Iraqi border town of [[Sinjar]] and leaked [[State Department]] cables, that "in the years that preceded the uprising, Assad and his intelligence services took the view that jihad could be nurtured and manipulated to serve the Syrian government's aims".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n07/peter-neumann/suspects-into-collaborators |last=Neumann |first=Peter |title=Suspects into Collaborators |work=London Review of Books |date=3 April 2014 |access-date=8 March 2015}}</ref> Other leaked cables contained remarks by US general [[David Petraeus]] which stated that "Bashar al-Asad was well aware that his brother-in-law 'Asif Shawqat, Director of Syrian Military Intelligence, had detailed knowledge of the activities of AQI facilitator [[Abu Ghadiya]], who was using Syrian territory to bring foreign fighters and suicide bombers into Iraq", with later cables adding that Petraeus thought that "in time, these fighters will turn on their Syrian hosts and begin conducting attacks against Bashar al-Assad's regime itself".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2012/07/slain_syrian_officia.php |title=Slain Syrian official supported al Qaeda in Iraq |work=The Long War Journal |first=Thomas |last=Joscelyn |date=24 July 2012 |access-date=3 February 2016}}</ref>

During the [[Iraq War]], the Assad government was accused of training jihadis and facilitating their passage into Iraq, with these infiltration routes remaining active until the [[Syrian Civil War]]; US General [[Jack Keane]] has stated that "Al Qaeda fighters who are back in Syria, I am confident, they are relying on much they learned in moving through Syria into Iraq for more than five years when they were waging war against the U.S. and Iraq Security Assistance Force".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/19/al-qaeda-rat-line-from-syria-to-iraq-turns-back-ag/?page=all |last1=Scarborough |first1=Rowan |title=Al Qaeda 'rat line' from Syria to Iraq turns back against Assad |work=The Washington Times |date=19 August 2013 |access-date=8 March 2015}}</ref> Iraqi president [[Nouri al-Maliki]] threatened Assad with an international tribunal over the matter, and ultimately lead to the [[2008 Abu Kamal raid]], and United States airstrikes within Syria during the Iraq War.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2d8b6e32-eb35-11e3-8a5f-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F2d8b6e32-eb35-11e3-8a5f-00144feabdc0.html |last=Daragahi |first=Borzou |title=Iraq alliances twisted by Syria conflict |work=Financial Times |date=21 June 2014 |access-date=8 March 2015 |quote=Just five years ago, Mr Maliki threatened to drag the Assad government to an international tribunal for facilitating the flow of al-Qaeda militants into Iraq to disrupt the US military presence and attack Shia civilians.
