As part of a group of Democrats proposing "more incremental steps to broaden health care coverage", as opposed to [[Bernie Sanders]]'s push for "Medicare for All", Bennet and Senator [[Tim Kaine]] have proposed "Medicare X". Medicare X would "create a public option modeled after [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] alongside private options on the [[ObamaCare]] [[Health insurance marketplace|marketplaces]]".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Peter|title=Democrats march toward single-payer health care|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/375376-democrats-march-toward-single-payer-health-care|website=The Hill|access-date=February 25, 2018}}</ref> In 2019 Bennet and Kaine reintroduced the latest version of the plan, which would also "expand access to tax credits."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://politi.co/2FJ95JM|title=Bennet, Kaine set to introduce 'Medicare X' plan to expand health care|last=Levine|first=Marianne|website=POLITICO|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref>

In August 2018, Bennet was one of 17 senators to sign a letter spearheaded by [[Kamala Harris]] to [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Kirstjen Nielsen]] demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying "trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/401999-senate-democrats-demand-immediate-reunification-of-remaining-separated|title=Senate Dems demand immediate reunification of remaining separated children|first=Nathaniel|last=Weixel|date=August 15, 2018|work=The Hill}}</ref>

In June 2019, Bennet and six other Democratic senators led by Hawaii Senator [[Brian Schatz]] sent letters to the Government Accountability Office and the suspension and debarment official and inspector general at the US Department of Health and Human Services citing recent reports that showed "significant evidence that some federal contractors and grantees have not provided adequate accommodations for children in line with legal and contractual requirements" and urged the officials to determine whether federal contractors and grantees are in violation of contractual obligations or federal regulations and should thus face financial consequences.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://mauinow.com/2019/06/26/schatz-urges-investigation-of-contractors-in-charge-of-migrant-children/|title=Schatz Urges Investigation of Contractors In Charge of Migrant Children|date=June 26, 2019|publisher=mauinow.com}}</ref>

In July 2019, following reports that the Trump administration intended to cease protecting spouses, parents and children of active-duty service members from deportation, Bennet was one of 22 senators led by [[Tammy Duckworth]] to sign a letter arguing that the protection gave service members the ability "to fight for the United States overseas and not worry that their spouse, children, or parents will be deported while they are away" and that its termination would both cause service members personal hardship and negatively affect their combat performance.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://wset.com/news/nation-world/senate-democrats-to-trump-dont-deport-military-families|title=Senate Democrats to Trump: don't deport military families|first=Ida|last=Domingo|date=July 11, 2019|publisher=wset.com}}</ref>

=== Environmental policy ===
In October 2017, Bennet was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Scott Pruitt]] questioning Pruitt's decision to repeal the [[Clean Power Plan]], asserting that Pruitt used "mathematical sleights of hand to overstate the costs of industry compliance with the 2015 Rule and understate the benefits that will be lost if the 2017 repeal is finalized", and that science denial and math tricks fail to "satisfy the requirements of the law, nor will it slow the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the inexorable rise in sea levels, or the other dire effects of global warming that our planet is already experiencing."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/357446-19-sens-question-epa-methodology-behind-clean-power-plan-repeal|title=19 sens question EPA methodology behind Clean Power Plan repeal|first=Julia|last=Manchester|work=The Hill}}</ref>

They wrote: "In American news outlets, Beijing has used financial ties to suppress negative information about the CCP. In the past four years, multiple media outlets with direct or indirect financial ties to China allegedly decided not to publish stories on wealth and corruption in the CCP.

The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/international/americas/437463-more-than-30-dem-sens-ask-trump-to-reconsider-cutting-foreign|title=More than 30 Senate Dems ask Trump to reconsider Central American aid cuts|first=Rachel|last=Frazin|date=April 4, 2019|work=The Hill}}</ref>
