'''Waterboarding''' is a form of [[torture]] in which [[water torture|water is poured]] over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the person to experience the sensation of [[drowning]]. In the most common method of waterboarding, the captive's face is covered with cloth or some other thin material and immobilized on his/her back at an incline of 10 to 20 degrees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quit-torture-now.org/static/media/uploads/waterboard.gif |title=Waterboarding |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210013200/http://www.quit-torture-now.org/static/media/uploads/waterboard.gif |archive-date=10 December 2014 |work=Quaker Initiative to End Torture |access-date=26 June 2018 }}</ref><ref name="Salon20100309">{{cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2010/03/09/waterboarding_for_dummies/ |date=9 March 2010 |title=Waterboarding for dummies |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] | author=Mark Benjamin | quote=After immobilizing a prisoner by strapping him down, interrogators then tilted the gurney to a 10-15 degree downward angle, with the detainee's head at the lower end.

Waterboarding has been used in diverse places and at various points in history, including the Spanish and Flemish Inquisitions, by the United States military during the Philippine-American War, by U.S. law enforcement, by Japanese and German officials during World War II, by the French in the Algerian War, by the U.S. during the Vietnam War (despite a ban on the practice by U.S. generals), by the Pinochet regime in Chile, by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, by the British Army in Northern Ireland, and by South African police during the apartheid era. While there is international debate over whether waterboarding constitutes torture, many 21st century authorities assert that it is.

Water was poured over the face using the [[watering can]]. The use of this type of waterboard is depicted in a painting by former Tuol Sleng prisoner [[Vann Nath]], shown in that article.]]
The use of waterboarding became a matter of public controversy in the United States during the [[War on Terror]] in the 2000s. In December 2005, the United States passed the [[Detainee Treatment Act]], which banned U.S. military from using torture (including waterboarding); the bill was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/us/politics/23obama.html|title=Obama Reverses Key Bush Security Policies|first1=Scott|last1=Shane|first2=Mark|last2=Mazzetti|first3=Helene|last3=Cooper|date=22 January 2009|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/25/17778146/john-mccain-dies-torture-legacy-waterboarding-enhanced-interrogation-cia |title=Sen.

==Etymology==
While the technique has been used in various forms for centuries,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2007/11/03/15886834/waterboarding-a-tortured-history|title=Waterboarding: A Tortured History|website=NPR.org|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref> the term ''water board'' was recorded first in a 1976 [[UPI]] report: "A Navy spokesman admitted use of the 'water board' torture ... to 'convince each trainee that he won't be able to physically resist what an enemy would do to him.'" The verb-noun ''waterboarding'' dates from 2004.<ref name=Safire/> First appearance of the term in the mass media was in a ''[[New York Times]]'' article on 13 May 2004:

{{Quote|In the case of [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]], a high-level detainee who is believed to have helped plan the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, C.I.A. interrogators used graduated levels of force, including a technique known as 'water boarding', in which a prisoner is strapped down, forcibly pushed under water and made to believe he might drown.<!--DO ''not'' ALTER THE PUNCTUATION OR SPELLING OF THIS DIRECT QUOTE.--><ref name=Safire/><ref name=Risen>{{cite news

U.S. attorney [[Alan Dershowitz]] is reported to have shortened the term to a single word in a ''[[Boston Globe]]'' article two days later: "After all, the administration did approve rough interrogation methods for some high valued detainees. These included waterboarding, in which a detainee is pushed under water and made to believe he will drown unless he provides information, as well as sensory deprivation, painful stress positions, and simulated dog attacks".<ref>{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Dershowitz|author-link=Alan Dershowitz|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/05/15/covering_up_the_coverup/|title=Covering up the coverup|date=15 May 2004|access-date=17 April 2009|work=[[Boston Globe]]}}</ref> Dershowitz later told the ''New York Times'' columnist [[William Safire]] that, "when I first used the word, nobody knew what it meant."<ref name=Safire>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/magazine/09wwlnSafire-t.html|title=On Language: Waterboarding|last=Safire|first=William|author-link=William Safire|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 March 2008|access-date=17 April 2009}}</ref>

Techniques using forcible drowning to extract information had hitherto been referred to as "[[water torture]]", "water treatment", "[[Water cure (torture)|water cure]]" or simply "torture".<ref name=Safire/><ref name=macdonald20080513>{{cite web|first=Isabel|last=MacDonald|url=http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/06/14/9615/|title=From Water Torture to 'Waterboarding'|date=13 May 2008|access-date=17 April 2009|work=[[Extra!]]}}</ref>

Professor [[Darius Rejali]] of [[Reed College]], author of ''[[Torture and Democracy]]'' (2007), speculates that the term waterboarding probably has its origin in the need for a [[euphemism]]. 
<blockquote>There is a special vocabulary for torture. When people use tortures that are old, they rename them and alter them a wee bit. They invent slightly new words to mask the similarities. This creates an inside club, especially important in work where secrecy matters. Waterboarding is clearly a jailhouse joke. It refers to surfboarding"– a word found as early as 1929– "they are attaching somebody to a board and helping them surf. Torturers create names that are funny to them."<ref name=Safire/></blockquote>

''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' first included the term in 2009: "[A]n interrogation technique in which water is forced into a detainee's mouth and nose so as to induce the sensation of drowning."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/waterboarding |title=Definition of Waterboarding by Merriam-Webster |work=[[Merriam-Webster]] }}</ref>

==Technique==
Waterboarding was characterized in 2005 by former CIA director [[Porter J. Goss]] as a "[[Enhanced interrogation techniques|professional interrogation technique]]".<ref name="HRW_WB_110507">{{cite news|title=CIA Whitewashing Torture|date=21 November 2005|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2005/11/20/cia-whitewashing-torture|access-date=17 April 2009}}</ref> According to press accounts, a cloth or [[plastic wrap]] is placed over or in the person's mouth, and water is poured onto the person's head. Press accounts differ on the details of this technique – one article describes "dripping water into a wet cloth over a suspect's face",<ref name=hirsh20040621>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Hirsh|author-link=Michael Hirsh (journalist) |author2=John Barry |author3=Daniel Klaidman|title=A Tortured Debate |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/54093|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=21 June 2004|access-date=17 April 2009}}</ref> while another states that "cellophane is wrapped over the prisoner's face and water is poured over him".<ref name=ABCNewsWB_110807/>

{{main|Torture Memos}}
The United States' [[Office of Legal Counsel]] in August 2002 responded to the request by the CIA for a legal opinion regarding the use of certain interrogation techniques. It included the following account of the CIA's definition of waterboarding in a [[Bybee memo|Top Secret 2002 memorandum]] as follows:

{{Quote|In this procedure, the individual is bound securely to an inclined bench, which is approximately four feet by seven feet. The individual's feet are generally elevated. A cloth is placed over the forehead and eyes. Water is then applied to the cloth in a controlled manner. As this is done, the cloth is lowered until it covers both the nose and mouth. Once the cloth is saturated and completely covers the mouth and nose, air flow is slightly restricted for 20 to 40 seconds due to the presence of the cloth... During those 20 to 40 seconds, water is continuously applied from a height of twelve to twenty-four inches. After this period, the cloth is lifted, and the individual is allowed to breathe unimpeded for three or four full breaths... The procedure may then be repeated. The water is usually applied from a canteen cup or small watering can with a spout... You have... informed us that it is likely that this procedure would not last more than twenty minutes in any one application.<ref name=Bybee-2002-08-01 />}}

Historically in the West, the technique is known to have been used in the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. The suffocation of bound prisoners with water has been favored because, unlike most other torture techniques, it produces no marks on the body.<ref name="NPR_WB_110307">{{cite news|title=Waterboarding: An Issue Before Mukasey's Bid|date=3 November 2007|publisher=[[NPR]]|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15917081|work=[[All Things Considered]]|access-date=17 April 2009}}</ref> CIA officers who have subjected themselves to the technique have lasted an average of 14&nbsp;seconds before [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulating]].<ref name=ABCNewsWB_110807/> According to at least one former CIA official, information retrieved from the waterboarding may not be reliable because a person under such duress may admit to anything, as harsh interrogation techniques lead to false confessions. "The person believes they are being killed, and as such, it really amounts to a [[mock execution]], which is illegal under international law", says John Sifton of [[Human Rights Watch]].<ref name=ABCNewsWB_110807/> It is "bad interrogation. I mean you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough", said former CIA officer [[Bob Baer]].<ref name=ABCNewsWB_110807/> There was considerable dissension within the Bush administration over the use of these techniques; both military investigators and the FBI opposed them.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

Metal objects were placed in each of his hands, which he could drop if feeling "unbearable stress". The interrogator placed a towel over Hitchens' face, and poured water on it. After 16 seconds, Hitchens threw the metal objects to the floor and the torturers pulled the mask from his face, allowing him to breathe.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LPubUCJv58 Watch Christopher Hitchens get waterboarded (Vanity Fair)] at YouTube</ref> In his article on the topic, he stated "Well, then, if waterboarding does not constitute torture, then there is no such thing as torture."<ref name = hitchvanity2008 /> In 2016, conservative commentator [[Steven Crowder]] demonstrated waterboarding on his YouTube channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpdhwM_hnAA&t=638s|title=STEVEN CROWDER WATERBOARDED FOR CHRISTMAS!!|date=22 December 2016|access-date=15 May 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>

==Mental and physical effects==
Allen Keller, the director of the [[Bellevue Hospital]]/[[New York University]] Program for Survivors of Torture, has treated "a number of people" who had been subjected to forms of near-asphyxiation, including waterboarding. In an interview for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', he argued that "it was indeed torture. 'Some victims were still traumatized years later', he said. One patient couldn't take showers, and panicked when it rained. 'The fear of being killed is a terrifying experience', he said".<ref name="NY"/> Keller also gave a full description in 2007 in testimony before the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] on the practice:<ref>{{cite web|first= Allen S.|last= Keller|title= Water-boarding|url   =http://intelligence.senate.gov/070925/akeller.pdf#page=6|work  = Statement by Allen S.

The CIA's Office of Medical Services noted in a 2003 memo that "for reasons of physical fatigue or psychological resignation, the subject may simply give up, allowing excessive filling of the airways and loss of consciousness".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2010/03/09/waterboarding_for_dummies/index.html | title=Waterboarding for dummies | author=Mark Benjamin | quote=In our limited experience, extensive sustained use of the waterboard can introduce new risks, [...] Most seriously, for reasons of physical fatigue or psychological resignation, the subject may simply give up, allowing excessive filling of the airways and loss of consciousness.}}</ref>

In an open letter in 2007 to [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]], [[Human Rights Watch]] asserted that waterboarding can cause the sort of "severe pain" prohibited by {{usc|18|2340}} (the implementation in the United States of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]]), that the psychological effects can last long after waterboarding ends (another of the criteria under 18 USC 2340), and that uninterrupted waterboarding can ultimately cause death.<ref name="HRW open letter WB"/>

Subsequently, the U.S. government released the [[Bybee memo]], a memorandum dated August 1, 2002, from [[Jay Bybee]] at the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] for [[White House Counsel]] [[Albert Gonzales]]. The OLC memo concluded that waterboarding did not constitute torture and could be used to interrogate subject; Bybee reasoned that "in order for pain or suffering to rise to the level of torture, the statute requires that it be severe" and that waterboarding did not cause severe pain or suffering either physically or mentally.<ref name=Bybee-2002-08-01>{{cite web

Examining the four newspapers with the highest daily circulation in the country (''The New York Times'', ''The Los Angeles Times'', ''The Wall Street Journal'' and ''USA Today'') a student group of the [[Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy]] found that newspapers "almost uniformly" characterized waterboarding as torture from the 1930s until the [[September 11 attacks]], at which point a "significant and sudden shift" occurred. Between 2002 and 2008, newspapers only seldom referred to waterboarding as torture.<ref name=harvard>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820063441/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/presspol/publications/papers/torture_at_times_hks_students.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2010 |title=Torture at Times: Waterboarding in the Media |work=Harvard Student Paper |date=April 2010 |url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/presspol/publications/papers/torture_at_times_hks_students.pdf }}</ref> The group also noted the newspapers described waterboarding as torture far more frequently when it was performed by countries other than the United States.<ref name=harvard />

===Spanish Inquisition===
A form of torture similar to waterboarding is called ''toca'', and more recently "Spanish water torture", to differentiate it from the better known [[Chinese water torture]], along with ''garrucha'' (or [[strappado]]) and the most frequently used ''potro'' (or the [[rack (torture)|rack]]). This was used infrequently during [[Spanish Inquisition#The trial|the trial portion of the Spanish Inquisition process]]. "The ''toca'', also called ''tortura del agua'', consisted of introducing a cloth into the mouth of the victim, and forcing them to ingest water spilled from a jar so that they had the impression of drowning".<ref>{{cite book |first=George Ryley |last=Scott |title=The History of Torture Throughout the Ages |publisher=[[Kegan Paul]] |location=[[London]] |year=2004 |page=172 |isbn=0-7103-0837-X |oclc=51963457}}</ref> William Schweiker claims that the use of water as a form of torture also had profound religious significance to the Inquisitors.<ref name="UCHI_WB_112907">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6385.2008.00395.x |title=Torture and Religious Practice |date=Fall 2008 |first=William |last=Schweiker |journal=Dialog |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=208–216}}</ref>

In general, waterboarding seemed to be very extended in the Spanish detention centers in the 1500s. Books from the time explain how to treat persons in custody, and used this "light" form of torture. After a specific way of beating, body, legs and arms, it was detailed how to pour 4 cuartillos (approx. 2.5 liters) of water over mouth and nose, with a covering cloth, making sure there was some cloth introduced in the mouth so water could also get in.<ref name="Quixote">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://cvc.cervantes.es/literatura/clasicos/quijote/edicion/parte1/cap22/default.htm |title=[[Don Quixote]] |chapter=Chapter XXII |language=es |quote=Footnote 22: 'agua', en germanía; cantar en el ansia es, pues, 'confesar cuando dan el tormento del agua, el más suave de los que se podían aplicar'. |access-date=5 August 2018 }}</ref>

<blockquote>And as they did still not obtain anything from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I was at the end of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.</blockquote>

===Colonial times===
[[File:amboyna.jpg|thumb|210px|Torture of the English by the Dutch according to the English account]]
Agents of the [[Dutch East India Company]] used a precursor to waterboarding during the [[Amboyna massacre]] of English prisoners, which took place on the island of [[Ambon Island|Amboyna]] in the [[Maluku Islands|Molucca Islands]] in 1623. At that time, it consisted of wrapping cloth around the victim's head, after which the torturers "poured the water softly upon his head until the cloth was full, up to the mouth and nostrils, and somewhat higher, so that he could not draw breath but he must suck in all the water".<ref>{{cite book |author=[[East India Company]] |title=A true relation of the vniust, cruell, and barbarous proceedings against the English at Amboyna in the East-Indies |year=1624 |url=https://archive.org/details/trverelationofvn00east |location=[[London]] |publisher=H.

===American prisons before World War I===
An editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of 6 April 1852, and a subsequent 21 April 1852 letter to the editors documents an incidence of waterboarding, then called "showering" or "hydropathic torture", in New York's [[Sing Sing]] prison of an inmate named Henry Hagan, who, after several other forms of beating and mistreatment, had his head shaved, and "certainly three, and possibly a dozen, barrels of water were poured upon his naked scalp". Hagan was then placed in a yoke.<ref name="nydt1">{{cite news |title=Extra-Judicial Punishments |date=6 April 1852 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9802E3D71331E234BC4E53DFB2668389649FDE |page=2 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=18 April 2009}}</ref> A correspondent listed only as "H" later wrote: "Perhaps it would be well to state more fully the true character of this 'hydropathic torture.' The stream of water is about one inch in diameter, and falls from a {{sic|hi|ght}} of seven or eight feet. The head of the patient is retained in its place by means of a board clasping the neck; the effect of which is, that the water, striking upon the board, rebounds into the mouth and nostrils of the victim, almost producing strangulation. Congestion, sometimes of the heart or lungs, sometimes of the brain, not {{sic|un|frequently}} ensues; and death, in due season, has released some sufferers from the further ordeal of the water cure. As the water is administered officially, I suppose that it is not murder!" H. then went on to cite an 1847 New York law which limited prison discipline to individual confinement "upon a short allowance."<ref name="nydt2">{{cite news |title=Prison Punishments—Showering |date=21 April 1852 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E0DE1531E13BBC4951DFB2668389649FDE |page=4 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=18 April 2009}}</ref>

Prisoners in late 19th-century Alabama, and in Mississippi in the first third of the 20th century, also suffered waterboarding. In Alabama, in lieu of or in addition to other physical punishment, a "prisoner was strapped down on his back; then 'water [was] poured in his face on the upper lip, and effectually stop[ped] his breathing as long as there [was] a constant stream'."<ref>Mary Ellen Curtin, Black Prisoners and their World, Alabama, 1865–1900, at 69 (The University Press of Virginia 2000).</ref> In Mississippi, the accused was held down, and water was poured "from a dipper into the nose so as to strangle him, thus causing pain and horror, for the purpose of forcing a confession."<ref>Neil R. McMillen, Dark Journey: Black Mississippians in the Age of Jim Crow, at 213 (University of Illinois Press 1990).</ref>

===During the Philippine–American War===
[[File:Life 05-22-1902.JPG|thumb|1902 [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] cover, depicting water curing by U.S. troops in the Philippines]]
The U.S. army used waterboarding, called the "[[Water cure (torture)|water cure]]", during the [[Philippine–American War]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} It is not clear where this practice came from; it probably was adopted from the Filipinos, who themselves adopted it from the Spanish.<ref>p. 280, ''Torture and Democracy'', Darius Rejali, Princeton University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0-691-14333-1}}.</ref> Reports of "cruelties" from soldiers stationed in the [[Philippines]] led to Senate hearings on U.S. activity there.

Testimony described the waterboarding of Tobeniano Ealdama "while supervised by ...Captain/Major Edwin F. Glenn ([[Glenn Highway]])".<ref name=kramer20080225>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Kramer |title=The Water Cure |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=25 February 2008 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/02/25/080225fa_fact_kramer |access-date=18 April 2009}}</ref>

[[Elihu Root]], [[United States Secretary of War]], ordered a [[court martial]] for Glenn in April 1902."<ref>{{cite news |title=More Courts-Martial in the Philippines |date=16 April 1902 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9800E1D81230E733A25755C1A9629C946397D6CF |page=1 |access-date=18 April 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> During the trial, Glenn "maintained that the torture of Ealdama was 'a legitimate exercise of force under the laws of war.'"<ref name="kramer20080225" />

President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] privately rationalized the instances of "mild torture, the water cure" but publicly called for efforts to "prevent the occurrence of all such acts in the future". In that effort, he ordered the court-martial of General [[Jacob H. Smith]] on the island of [[Samar]], "where some of the worst abuses had occurred". When the court-martial found only that he had acted with excessive zeal, Roosevelt disregarded the verdict and had the General dismissed from the Army.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1007/6647.html |title=Roosevelt was right: Waterboarding wrong |first=Daniel A. |last=Rezneck |date=31 October 2007 |access-date=18 April 2009 |publisher=[[The Politico]]}}</ref>

Roosevelt soon declared victory in the Philippines, and the public lost interest in "what had, only months earlier, been alarming revelations".<ref name=kramer20080225/>

===By U.S. police before the 1940s===
The use of "[[Third degree (interrogation)|third degree interrogation]]" techniques to compel confession, ranging from "psychological duress such as prolonged confinement to extreme violence and torture", was widespread in early American policing. Lassiter classified the water cure as "orchestrated physical abuse",<ref name=lassiter2004p47-48>{{cite book |first=G.

The technique employed by the police involved either holding the head in water until almost drowning, or laying on the back and forcing water into the mouth or nostrils.<ref name=lassiter2004p47-48/> Such techniques were classified as "'covert' third degree torture" since they left no signs of physical abuse, and became popular after 1910 when the direct application of physical violence to force a confession became a media issue and some courts began to deny obviously compelled confessions.<ref name="leo">{{cite journal |first=Richard A. |last=Leo |date=September 1992 |title=From coercion to deception: the changing nature of police interrogation in America |journal=Crime, Law and Social Change |volume=18 |issue=1–2 |pages=35–59 |doi=10.1007/BF00230624|s2cid=144210248 }}</ref> The publication of this information in 1931 as part of the [[Wickersham Commission]]'s "Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement" led to a decline in the use of third degree police interrogation techniques in the 1930s and 1940s.<ref name="leo" />

However, according to a declassified Justice Department memo attempting to justify torture which references a still-classified report of the CIA Inspector General on the CIA's use of waterboarding, among other "enhanced" interrogation techniques, the CIA applied waterboarding to detainees "in a different manner" than the technique used in SERE training:

<blockquote>The difference was in the manner in which the detainees' breathing was obstructed. At the SERE school and in the DoJ opinion, the subject's airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passages; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contrast, the Agency interrogator ... applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee's mouth and nose. One of the psychiatrist / interrogators acknowledged that the Agency's use of the technique is different from that used in SERE training because it is 'for real' and is more poignant and convincing.<ref name="huffingtonpost.com">Worthington, Andy (1 July 2009) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andy-worthington/release-of-the-holy-grail_b_224447.html "Release of the "Holy Grail" of Torture Reports Delayed Again".] ''Huffington Post''. Retrieved 2 July 2009.</ref>
</blockquote>

According to the DOJ memo, the IG Report observed that the CIA's Office of Medical Services (OMS) stated that "the experience of the SERE psychologist / interrogators on the waterboard was probably misrepresented at the time, as the SERE waterboard experience is so different from the subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant" and that "[c]onsequently, according to OMS, there was no a priori reason to believe that applying the waterboard with the frequency and intensity with which it was used by the psychologist/interrogators was either efficacious or medically safe."

In May 2011, Obama authorized a successful commando [[Death of Osama bin Laden|raid to kill Osama Bin Laden]]. The extent to which waterboarding assisted in ascertaining the whereabouts of Bin Laden is a matter of dispute. Former Attorney General [[Michael Mukasey]] criticized the Obama administration for denying future missions the intelligence capability that made the raid possible: "Acknowledging and meeting the need for an effective and lawful interrogation program, which we once had, and freeing CIA operatives and others to administer it under congressional oversight, would be a fitting way to mark the demise of Osama bin Laden."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703859304576305023876506348?mod=googlenews_wsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Michael B. | last=Mukasey | title=The Waterboarding Trail to bin Laden | date=6 May 2011}}</ref> CIA Director [[Leon Panetta]], who supervised the operation that found and killed bin Laden, stated in an interview with NBC reporter [[Brian Williams]]: "...they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of these detainees.

Republican Senator [[John McCain]], in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' opinion piece,<ref name="Lind"/> disputed Mukasey's account, saying:
{{quote|I asked CIA Director Leon Panetta for the facts, and he told me the following: The trail to bin Laden did not begin with a disclosure from Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who was waterboarded 183 times. The first mention of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti — the nickname of the al-Qaeda courier who ultimately led us to bin Laden — as well as a description of him as an important member of al-Qaeda, came from a detainee held in another country, who we believe was not tortured. None of the three detainees who were waterboarded provided Abu Ahmed's real name, his whereabouts or an accurate description of his role in al-Qaeda.

In fact, the use of 'enhanced interrogation techniques' on Khalid Sheik Mohammed produced false and misleading information. He specifically told his interrogators that Abu Ahmed had moved to Peshawar, got married and ceased his role as an al-Qaeda facilitator — none of which was true. According to the staff of the Senate intelligence committee, the best intelligence gained from a CIA detainee — information describing Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti's real role in al-Qaeda and his true relationship to bin Laden — was obtained through standard, noncoercive means.}}

==Effectiveness==
Waterboarding and other forms of water torture have historically been used for 1) punishing, 2) forcing confessions for use in trials 3) eliciting false confessions for political purposes, and 4) obtaining factual intelligence for military purposes.

===For eliciting confessions===
Its use principally for obtaining confessions rather than as punishment dates back to the 15th century and the [[Spanish Inquisition#Trial|Spanish Inquisition]].

===For obtaining actionable intelligence===
{{see|Effectiveness of torture for interrogation}}
Waterboarding's effectiveness as a technique for reliably obtaining truthful, useful intelligence has not been established. In May 2003, a senior CIA interrogator told the CIA's Office of Inspector General that the EIT then being used by the CIA was modeled after U.S. resistance training to prepare servicemen for "physical torture" by North Vietnamese. This torture, including waterboarding, was intended to extract "confessions for propaganda purposes" from U.S. airman "who possessed little actionable intelligence." If the CIA wanted to obtain useful information rather than false confessions, he said, the CIA needed "a different working model for interrogating terrorists."<ref name="ssci-report"/>{{rp|33}} Nonetheless, with the active support of former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], the CIA embraced the EIT approach proposed by two psychologists, [[James Elmer Mitchell]] and [[Bruce Jessen]], neither of whom had interrogation experience.<ref name="ssci-report"/>{{rp|21, 32}} While Cheney continues to maintain that waterboarding has "produced phenomenal results" including tracking down [[Osama bin Laden]],<ref>{{cite news|last=McGreal|first=Chris|title=Dick Cheney defends use of torture on al-Qaida leaders |newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/09/dick-cheney-defends-torture-al-qaida|date=9 September 2011|access-date=2 December 2015}}</ref> the report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that "the CIA's use of its enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees."

Bent Sørensen, Senior Medical Consultant to the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]] and former member of the United Nations [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] has said:

{{Quote|It's a clear-cut case: Waterboarding can without any reservation be labeled as torture. It fulfils all of the four central criteria that according to the United Nations Convention Against Torture (UNCAT) defines an act of torture. First, when water is forced into your lungs in this fashion, in addition to the pain you are likely to experience an immediate and extreme fear of death. You may even suffer a heart attack from the stress or damage to the lungs and brain from inhalation of water and oxygen deprivation. In other words there is no doubt that waterboarding causes severe physical and/or mental suffering– one central element in the UNCAT's definition of torture. In addition the CIA's waterboarding clearly fulfills the three additional definition criteria stated in the Convention for a deed to be labeled torture, since it is 1) done intentionally, 2) for a specific purpose and 3) by a representative of a state– in this case the US.<ref name=icrt20080212>{{cite press release |title=Former member of UN Committee Against Torture: 'Yes, waterboarding is torture' |publisher=[[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]] |date=12 February 2008 |url=http://www.irct.org/news-and-media/irct-news/show-news.aspx?M=NewsV2&PID=13767&NewsID=1236 |access-date=21 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720062209/http://www.irct.org/news-and-media/irct-news/show-news.aspx?M=NewsV2&PID=13767&NewsID=1236 |archive-date=20 July 2011}}</ref>}}

While waterboarding has been depicted in several films and demonstrated at protest gatherings, images of its actual use are scarce. The CIA allegedly destroyed all videos it made of the procedure. The 1968 ''Washington Post'' photo of a captured North Vietnamese soldier being interrogated is arguably different because instead of being strapped to a board, the prisoner is held down by two soldiers as a third pours water from a canteen over a cloth covering face.<ref>{{Cite web |date=7 February 2006 |title=History of an Interrogation Technique: Water Boarding |url=https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1356870 |website=ABC News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Pincus |first=Walter |date=5 October 2006 |title=Waterboarding Historically Controversial |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/04/AR2006100402005.html |via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>
One eyewitness depiction of waterboarding is a painting by [[Vann Nath]], a [[Cambodia]]n artist who was held captive and tortured by the [[Khmer Rouge]]. After his release in 1979 from [[Tuol Sleng Prison]], he began to paint pictures of the abusive practices used there, including waterboarding, to let people know about them, saying of the prisoners he heard screaming for help: "I would like their souls to get something from what I paint."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Vann Nath - Paint Propaganda or Die |url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/asian/Vann-Nath.html |access-date=14 May 2013 |publisher=The Art History Archive}}</ref> 
One of his waterboarding paintings depicts a sparse room with a man affixed to a board by iron bars. A cloth covers his head. Another man pours water from a watering can over his face. A similar board and watering can are on display at the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]]. ''Waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah'', a drawing by {{Interlanguage link multi|Dmitry Borshch|ru|3=Борщ, Дмитрий Геннадиевич}}, has been exhibited at the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], [[DePaul University]], [[Brecht Forum]], [[The Graduate Center, CUNY]], and [[Palace of Culture and Science]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah |url=http://pictify.saatchigallery.com/434930/waterboarding-of-abu-zubaydah}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=27 February 2014 |title=Literary scholar John Maynard and artist Dmitry Borshch in conversation on art |url=https://artsy.net/post/raccny-literary-scholar-john-maynard-and-artist-dmitry}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Artist: Dmitry Borshch - Artists on ArtDiscover |url=http://www.artdiscover.com/en/artists/dmitry-borshch-id1822}}</ref>
In 2008, the ''[[Coney Island waterboarding thrill ride]]'' went on display in [[Coney Island]] amusement park: viewers would see two models, one a captive wearing an [[Guantanamo captives' uniform|orange uniform]] who was spread-eagled on a tilted table, the other one a masked interrogator. When viewers inserted a dollar the interrogator figure would pour water onto a rag over the captive figures' nose and throat, upon which the captive figure would start convulsing.<ref name="NYMag2008-06-27">{{Cite news |date=27 June 2008 |title=Steve Powers Wants to See You Get Waterboarded |publisher=[[New York Magazine]] |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/06/any_lawyers_want_to_get_waterb.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006183421/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/06/any_lawyers_want_to_get_waterb.html |archive-date=6 October 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="WashingtonPost2008-08-17">{{Cite news |last=Robin Shulman |date=17 August 2008 |title=In N.Y., Waterboarding as Dark Art |work=[[Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/16/AR2008081602071.html |access-date=11 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Ritsuke Ando |date=7 August 2008 |title=Waterboarding an attraction at amusement park |publisher=[[Reuters]] |url=http://gothamist.com/2008/08/06/waterboard_thrill_ride_splashes_dow.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201204014/http://www.switched.com/2008/08/07/coney-islands-robotic-waterboard-thrill-ride-evokes-guantanam/ |archive-date=1 December 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>
