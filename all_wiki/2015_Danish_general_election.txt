'''General elections''' were held in the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] on 18 June 2015 to elect the 179 members of the [[Folketing]]. 175 members were elected in the [[Geography of Denmark|Denmark]] proper, two in the [[Geography of the Faroe Islands|Faroe Islands]] and two in [[Geography of Greenland|Greenland]]. Although the ruling [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] became the largest party in the [[Folketing]] and increased their seat count, the opposition [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] party was able to form a [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen II Cabinet|minority government]] headed by [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] with the support of the [[Danish People's Party]], the [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]].

==Background==
Following the [[2011 Danish general election|2011 general election]], a [[minority government]] was formed by the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]], the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]] and the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]]. The government was supported by the [[Red–Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red–Green Alliance]]. [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], the leader of the Social Democrats, became [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Priesler|first1=Marie|title=Helle Thorning-Schmidt: Danes must work more|url=http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2011-1/article.2011-10-06.6407706507|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=[[Nordic Labour Journal]]|date=6 October 2011}}</ref>

The government had rocky relations with the Red–Green Alliance, relying on their ''ad hoc'' support to pass bills instead of a formalized alliance. They have occasionally preferred to cooperate with [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] to pass legislation. Symbolically, Red–Green deputy [[Frank Aaen]] told Finance Minister [[Bjarne Corydon]] "Happy New Year" on 28 February 2013, because the government had failed to meet with his party since the beginning of 2013.<ref name="Information">{{cite news|last1=Kristensen|first1=Kim|title=Det røde ægteskab er gået i stykker|url=http://www.information.dk/comment/692309|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=[[Dagbladet Information]]|date=4 April 2013|language=Danish}}</ref>

On 3 February 2014, the Socialist People's Party left the government in protest over the sale of shares in the public energy company [[DONG Energy]] to the investment bank [[Goldman Sachs]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hakim|first1=Danny|title=Goldman Deal Threatens Danish Government|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/goldman-deal-threatens-danish-government/|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=30 January 2014}}</ref> This sparked a crisis within the Socialist People's Party, as three former cabinet ministers left the party, joining either the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] or the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]]. However, the Socialist People's Party continued to support the government on [[Motion of no confidence|confidence motions]], preventing an early election.<ref>{{cite news|title=SF leaves government, Vilhelmsen steps down|url=http://cphpost.dk/news14/national-news14/sf-leaves-government-vilhelmsen-steps-down.html|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=[[The Copenhagen Post]]|date=30 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626133309/http://cphpost.dk/news14/national-news14/sf-leaves-government-vilhelmsen-steps-down.html|archive-date=26 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The incumbent government prior to the elections consisted of a coalition between the Social Democrats and Social Liberal Party, with [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] continuing as Prime Minister. [[Thorning-Schmidt II Cabinet|The cabinet]] was composed of 14 Social Democratic ministers and 6 Social Liberal ministers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Regeringen Helle Thorning-Schmidt II|url=http://stm.dk/_p_13977.html|publisher=[[Ministry of the State of Denmark]]|date=3 February 2014|accessdate=24 June 2015|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Rømer|first1=Mikel|title=Benny Engelbrecht bliver ny skatteminister|url=http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/benny-engelbrecht-bliver-ny-skatteminister|accessdate=24 June 2015|publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]|date=1 September 2014|language=Danish}}</ref>

==Electoral system==
The 179 members of the Folketing were elected in Denmark (175), the [[Faroe Islands]] (2) and [[Greenland]] (2). The 175 seats in Denmark included 135 seats elected in ten multi-member constituencies by [[proportional representation]], using a modified version of the [[Sainte-Laguë method]] and [[Hare quota]], and 40 "top-up" seats, allocated to parties in order to address any imbalance in the distribution of the constituency seats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Folketinget (The Danish Parliament)|url=http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2087_B.htm|publisher=[[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]|accessdate=24 June 2015|date=10 April 1991}}</ref>

According to the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish Constitution]], the election had to be held no later than 14 September 2015, as the last election was held on 15 September 2011. The Prime Minister was able to call the election at any date, provided it was no later than four years from the previous election, and this is often cited as a tactical advantage to the sitting government, as it can call an early election when polls are favourable. On 27 May Thorning-Schmidt announced that the elections would be held on 18 June 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Danish PM calls general election, saying voters must have say on spending|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/27/danish-pm-general-election-voters-spending-helle-thorning-schmidt|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 May 2015}}</ref>

==Aftermath and government formation==
Although the Social Democrats increased their share of the vote and won the most seats for the first time since 2001, the "Blue" opposition bloc led by Venstre's Rasmussen (Venstre, Danish People's Party, Liberal Alliance, Conservative People's Party, and Christian Democrats) gained a parliamentary majority over the "Red" Social Democrat-led bloc (Social Democrats, Red–Green Alliance, The Alternative, Social Liberals, and Socialist People's Party). Within an hour of the election result being declared, Thorning-Schmidt announced her government would step down on 19 June, and that she would also resign as party leader on the same day.<ref name="auto"/>

In accordance with the Danish Constitution, on the day after the election each party submitted their recommendation to [[Monarchy of Denmark#Constitutional and official role|Queen]] [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]] for the appointment of a party to be in charge of government formation negotiations (the role of the Queen was purely formal, as her appointment had to reflect the will of the majority of the elected MPs). The submitted recommendations showed a parliamentary majority (all "blue bloc" parties) for Venstre to lead the process of government formation. The negotiation mandate was unconditional from all "blue bloc" parties, except Liberal Alliance, who initially made their support conditional on a first negotiation phase being restricted to the attempt to assemble a majority government (including all elected "blue bloc" parties). After Rasmussen had been granted this specific mandate, he invited such negotiations to begin on 20 June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2015-06/20/content_35868142.htm|title=Denmark's center-right coalition to form new gov't|publisher=[[China.org.cn]]|date=20 June 2015}}</ref>

Negotiations began on 20 June, but it was not thought likely that a majority government involving all the "blue bloc" parties was possible. The Conservative People's Party indicated they would rather stay out of a government coalition.<ref name=local>{{cite news|title=Rasmussen begins govt negotiations|url=http://www.thelocal.dk/20150620/rasmussen-begins-govt-negotiations|accessdate=24 June 2015|publisher=[[The Local]]|date=20 June 2015}}</ref>

The Danish People's Party set out four conditions for their involvement in a coalition: a Eurosceptic approach to the EU, the re-introduction of border controls, further restrictions on immigration and asylum policy, and 0.8% growth in public spending. Meanwhile, the Liberal Alliance also indicated willingness to be in a coalition, but the party supports reductions in public spending,<ref name=local/> as does Venstre.<ref name =yahoo>{{cite news|title=Denmark's Rasmussen to form minority govt|url=https://news.yahoo.com/denmarks-rasmussen-form-minority-govt-173628317.html|accessdate=24 June 2015|publisher=[[Yahoo! News]]|date=21 June 2015}}</ref>

On 21 June, Rasmussen concluded that, having tried, it would not be possible to form a majority government and he announced his intention to seek a new negotiation mandate allowing a minority government. On 28 June, Lars Løkke Rasmussen's [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen II Cabinet|new government]] assumed office with a cabinet composed solely of Venstre ministers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/politik/ECE7834142/Her-er-hele-Lars-L%C3%B8kkes-ministerhold/|title=Her er hele Lars Løkkes ministerhold|publisher=[[Jyllands-Posten]]|date=28 June 2015|language=Danish|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref>
