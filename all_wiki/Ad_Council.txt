The '''Advertising Council''', commonly known as the '''Ad Council''', is an [[United States|American]] nonprofit organization that produces, distributes, and promotes [[public service announcement]]s on behalf of various sponsors, including nonprofit organizations, [[non-governmental organization]]s and agencies of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]].<ref name="AdCouncil"/>

The Ad Council partners with advertising agencies which work [[pro bono]] to create the public service advertisements on behalf of their campaigns. The organization accepts requests from sponsor institutions for advertising campaigns that focus on particular social issues. To qualify, an issue must be non-partisan (though not necessarily unbiased) and have national relevance.

The Ad Council distributes the advertisements to a network of 33,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adcouncil.org/About-Us/Frequently-Asked-Questions|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref> media outlets—including broadcast, print, outdoor (i.e. billboards, bus stops), and Internet—which run the ads in donated time and space. Media outlets donate approximately $1.8 billion to Ad Council campaigns annually.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pet Adoption Campaign Partner Toolkit |url=https://www.maddiesfund.org/Documents/Funded%20Projects/Pet%20Adoption%20Campaign%20Toolkit.pdf |website=the shelter pet project |publisher=Ad Council, Humane Society of America, Maddie's Fund}}</ref> If paid for, this amount would make the Ad Council one of the largest advertisers in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/0426/042640.html/(page)/2|title=Public-service advertising nears No. 1 ad pace in US|date=26 April 1983|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2018|via=Christian Science Monitor}}</ref>

==History==
The organization was conceived in 1941, and it was incorporated as The Advertising Council, Inc., on February 26, 1942,<ref name= corp/> On June 25, 1943, it was renamed '''The War Advertising Council, Inc.'''<ref name= corp/> for the purpose of mobilizing the advertising industry in support of the war effort.

Before the conclusion of [[World War II]] President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] requested that the Ad Council continue its work during peacetime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/ad-council/98302/ |title=Ad Council |publisher=Advertising Age}}</ref> On February 5, 1946, The War Advertising Council officially changed its name back to The Advertising Council, Inc.,<ref name= corp/> and shifted its focus to issues such as atomic weapons, world trade and religious tolerance.<ref name="The Story of the Ad Council">{{cite web|title=The Story of the Ad Council|url=http://www.adcouncil.org/About-Us/The-Story-of-the-Ad-Council|publisher=AdCouncil.org}}</ref> In 1945, the Ad Council began working with the [[National Safety Council]].<ref name="Timeline" />

==Partnerships with film production companies==

==Criticism==

Given the Ad Council's historically close collaboration with the [[President of the United States]] and the federal government, it has been labeled by historian Robert Griffith as "little more than a domestic propaganda arm of the federal government."<ref>{{cite book | title= The Atomic Bomb and American Society: New Perspectives | last= Barnhart | first= Megan | year= 2009 | page= 106 | editor1-first= Rosemary B. | editor1-last= Mariner | editor2-first= G.

The Ad Council has been further criticized for distracting the public by focusing on individual lifestyle changes, rather than on the need to fix social problems by changing institutions, such as the Ad Council's many corporate sponsors, or the government and military, whose campaigns the Ad Council has also promoted.<ref>{{cite news | title= Occupy Earth Day: An Expose of the Corporate Propaganda Systems that Undermine Systemic Change Activism | last= Ewall | first= Mike | url= http://www.corporations.org/occupyearthday.html}}</ref>

Ad Council spots are used to fill unsold air time by stations and networks. [[Talk radio#Politically oriented talk radio|Political talk show]]s often have advertising time either controlled by the local station or a program's syndicating network that goes unsold; this is often filled by promotions for other programming on a station, short segments, and public service announcements, including from the Ad Council. Activists unfamiliar with the ad model of these programs or that of the Ad Council often complain to the Ad Council itself, along with the organizations which coordinate their messages with the Ad Council such as the [[AARP]], leading the Ad Council and the organizations to disclaim they do not share the views of the hosts where their announcements air, and have little to no control about where they may be scheduled to air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-07-2013/AARP-Statement-Regarding-Ad-Council-Public-Service-Announcements.html|title=AARP Press Room|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref>
