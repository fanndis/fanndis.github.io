'''John James Conyers Jr.'''{{efn|Possessive (Conyers's), plural (Conyerses), and plural possessive (Conyerses') all have three syllables.<!--[[wp:Manual_of_Style#Possessives]]-->}} (May 16, 1929{{snd}}October 27, 2019) was an American politician of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] who served as a [[U.S. Representative]] for [[Michigan]] from 1965 to 2017. The districts he represented always included part of western Detroit. During his final three terms, his district included many of Detroit's western suburbs, as well as a large portion of the [[Downriver]] area.

Conyers served more than fifty years in Congress, becoming the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service|sixth-longest serving member of Congress in U.S. history]]; he was the longest-serving African American member of Congress.<ref>Kathleen Gray, [https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2017/12/05/john-conyers-legacy-racial/923724001/ "U.S. Rep. John Conyers leaves behind legacy of civil rights, racial justice"], ''Detroit Free Press'' (December 5, 2017).</ref> Conyers was the [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives|Dean of the House of Representatives]]. By the end of his last term, he was the last remaining member of Congress who had served since the [[presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson]].

After serving in the [[Korean War]], Conyers became active in the [[civil rights movement]]. He also served as an aide to Congressman [[John Dingell]] before winning [[1964 United States House of Representatives elections|election to the House in 1964]]. He co-founded the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] in 1969 and established a reputation as one of the most [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] members of Congress. Conyers joined the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] after it was founded in 1991. Conyers supported creation of a [[single-payer healthcare]] system and sponsored the [[United States National Health Care Act]]. He also sponsored a bill to establish [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] as a federal holiday. Conyers ran for [[Mayor of Detroit]] in 1989 and 1993, but he was defeated in the primary each time.

Conyers served as the [[Ranking member|ranking Democratic member]] on the [[House Committee on the Judiciary]] from 1995 to 2007 and again from 2011 to 2017. He served as chairman of that committee from 2007 to 2011 and as Chairman of the [[House Oversight Committee]] from 1989 to 1995. In the wake of allegations that he had sexually harassed female staff members and secretly used taxpayer money to settle a harassment claim, Conyers announced his resignation from Congress on December 5, 2017.

== Early life, education, and early career ==

Conyers was born and raised in Detroit, the son of Lucille Janice (Simpson) and John James Conyers, a labor leader.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s21VHD28o0EC&q=%22John+(a+labor+leader)+and+Lucille+Janice+(Simpson)+Conyers%22|title=Newsmakers – 1999 Cumulation|publisher=[[Gale Research]]|page=104|isbn=9780787621124|year=2000}}</ref> Among his siblings was younger brother William Conyers.

Conyers served for a year in Korea during the [[Korean War]] as an officer in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] and was awarded combat and merit citations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/one-michigans-finest-john-conyers|title=One of Michigan's finest, John Conyers!|publisher=African American Registry|access-date=May 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614140930/http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/one-michigans-finest-john-conyers|archive-date=June 14, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After his active military service, Conyers pursued a college education. He earned both his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] (1957) and [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] (1958) degrees from [[Wayne State University]]. After he was admitted to the bar, he worked on the staff of Congressman [[John Dingell]]. He also served as counsel to several Detroit-area [[Local union|labor union locals]]. From 1961 to 1963, he was a referee for Michigan's workmen's compensation department.<ref name=nytobit>{{Cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/10/27/us/ap-us-obit-john-conyers-bio-box.html |title=John Conyers' Life at a Glance |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 16, 1929 |access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref>

Conyers became one of the leaders of the civil rights movement. He was present in [[Selma, Alabama]], on October 7, 1963, for the voter registration drive known as Freedom Day.<ref>{{Cite book |title=You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train |url=https://archive.org/details/youcantbeneutral00zinn_0 |url-access=registration |last=Zinn |first=Howard |author-link=Howard Zinn |year=1994 |publisher=Beacon Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/youcantbeneutral00zinn_0/page/63 63]–64}} <!-- Originally cited as: [[Howard Zinn]], ''You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train'' [Beacon Press, 1994; new ed. 2002], pp. 63–64 --></ref>

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== Elections ===

In 1964, Conyers ran for an open seat in what was then the 1st District, and defeated Republican Robert Blackwell with 84% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/former-congressman-john-conyers-passes-away |title=Former Congressman John Conyers passes away |publisher=FOX 2 Detroit |date=October 1, 2006 |access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref> He was reelected 13 times with even larger margins. After the [[1990 United States Census]], Michigan lost a congressional district, and there was redistricting. Conyers's district was renumbered as the [[Michigan's 14th congressional district|14th district]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/99681347/ |title=24 Mar 1992, Page 11 |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |via=Newspapers.com |date=March 24, 1992 |access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref>
[[File:John Conyers 1977 Congressional photo.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Conyers's official portrait]]

In 1992, Conyers won re-election to his 15th term in his new district, which included western suburbs of Detroit, with 82% of the vote against Republican nominee John Gordon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/99197328/ |title=5 Nov 1992, Page 20 |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |via=Newspapers.com |date=November 5, 1992 |access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref> He won re-election another nine times after that. His worst re-election performance was in [[2010 United States House of Representatives elections|2010]], when he got 77% of the vote against Republican nominee [[Don Ukrainec]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/203490431/ |title=3 Nov 2010, Page 7 |newspaper=[[Battle Creek Enquirer]] |via=Newspapers.com |date=November 3, 2010 |access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref> In 2013, his district was renamed as the [[Michigan's 13th congressional district|13th district]].

In total, Conyers won re-election twenty-five times and was serving in his twenty-sixth term. He was the [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives|dean of the House]] as longest-serving current member, the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service#House time|third longest-serving member of the House in history]], and the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service#Combined House and Senate time|sixth longest-serving member of Congress in history]]. He was the second-longest serving member of either house of Congress in Michigan's history, trailing only his former boss, Dingell. He was also the last member of the large Democratic freshman class of 1964 who was still serving in the House.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/10/27/john-conyers-obituary/2908410002/ |title=John Conyers, longest-serving black member of Congress in history, dies |publisher=Detroitnews.com |date= n.d.|access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref>

In May 2014, Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett determined that Conyers had not submitted enough valid nominating petition signatures to appear on the August 2014 Primary Election ballot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2014/05/invalid_petitions_could_keep_u.html |title=Invalid petitions could keep U.S. Rep.

But on May 23, Federal District Judge [[Matthew Leitman]] issued an injunction placing Conyers back on the ballot, ruling that the requirement that circulators be registered voters was similar to an Ohio law which had been found unconstitutional in 2008 by a Federal appeals court.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/us-rep-conyers-loses-appeal-ballot-23845096 |title=Judge Allows US Rep.

=== Tenure ===

Conyers was one of the 13 founding members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] (CBC) and was considered the Dean of that group. Formed in 1969, the CBC was founded to strengthen African-American lawmakers' ability to address the legislative concerns of Black and minority citizens. He served longer in Congress than any other African American. In 1971, he was one of the original members of [[Nixon's Enemies List]].<ref name=timeline>{{cite web|author=ET |url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/05/conyers-timeline/108350930/ |title=Timeline: Career of U.S. Rep.

In 1965, Conyers won a seat as a freshman on the influential [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]], which was then chaired by Democratic Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]] of New York. The assignment was considered an elite one, as Judiciary ranked behind only [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means]] and [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations]] in terms of the number of Members who sought assignment there.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://baic.house.gov/education/lesson-plans/essay3.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118071413/http://baic.house.gov/education/lesson-plans/essay3.pdf |archive-date=January 18, 2012}}</ref>

According to the ''[[National Journal]]'', Conyers has been considered, with [[Pete Stark]], [[John Lewis]], [[Jim McDermott]], and [[Barbara Lee]], to be one of the most [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] members of Congress for many years. [[Rosa Parks]], known for her prominent role in the [[Montgomery bus boycott|Montgomery, Alabama bus boycott]], moved to Detroit and served on Conyers's staff between 1965 and 1988.<ref>{{cite web|author=John NicholsTwitter |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/john-conyers-and-rosa-parks/ |title=John Conyers and Rosa Parks |work=The Nation |date=November 2, 2005 |access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref>

Conyers was known to have opposed regulation of [[online gambling]]. He opposed the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-gambling-congress-idUKN1421749820071114|title=U.S. lawmaker raps Internet-gambling enforcement|date=November 14, 2007|work=Reuters}}</ref> After the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] in 1968, Conyers introduced the first bill in Congress to make King's birthday a federal holiday.<ref name=timeline /> He continued to propose legislation to establish the federal holiday in every session of Congress from 1968 to 1983, when [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] was finally [[Passage of Martin Luther King Jr. Day|signed into law]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Crawford-Tichawonna |first=Nicole |title=Years of persistence led to holiday honoring King |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/01/12/king-holiday-origin/1006109001/ |date=January 12, 2018|accessdate=March 29, 2020 |work=[[USA Today]] |issue=January 12, 2018}}</ref>

Conyers introduced the "Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act" ({{USBill|101|HR|3745}}) in January 1989. He re-introduced this bill each congressional term. It calls for establishing a commission to research the history of [[slavery in the United States]] and its effects on current society, which is to recommend ways to remedy this injustice against African Americans. The current version was introduced and referred to committee on January 3, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conyers.house.gov/index.cfm/reparations |title=Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives – Current Vacancies |access-date=August 15, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829135025/http://conyers.house.gov/index.cfm/reparations |archive-date=August 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr40 |title=Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act (2013; 113th Congress H.R. 40) |website=GovTrack.us |date= n.d.|access-date=May 17, 2017}}</ref> Conyers first introduced the proposed resolution in 1989, and has stated his intention to annually propose this act until it is approved and passed.

=== Nixon and Watergate ===

Conyers was critical of President [[Richard Nixon]] during his tenure. He was listed as number 13 on President [[Nixon's Enemies List|Nixon's enemies list]] during the president's 1969–74 presidential tenure. The president's Chief Counsel described him as "coming on fast", and said he was "emerging" as a "black anti-Nixon spokesman".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enemieslist.info/enemy.php?ID=13|title=Nixon's Enemies List Search Results|website=enemieslist.info}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ratnesar |first=Romesh |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989212,00.html |title=Is The Top Democratic Gun Ready For War? |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 28, 1998 |access-date=October 28, 2019}}</ref> Conyers, who voted to [[impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeach Nixon]] in July 1974,<ref>{{Cite news|author=James M.

=== National Health Care Act ===

Conyers submitted the [[United States National Health Care Act]] (Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act) (H.R. 676); as of 2015, it had 49 cosponsors. He introduced it with 25 cosponsors, in 2003,<ref>{{USBill|108|HR|676}}</ref> and reintroduced it each session since then. The act calls for the creation of a universal [[single-payer health care]] system in the United States, in which the government would provide every resident health care free of charge. To eliminate disparate treatment between richer and poorer Americans, the Act would prohibit private insurers from covering any treatment or procedure already covered by the Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/28/16114436/john-conyers-single-payer-insurance |title=What Rep.

=== Downing Street memo ===

On May 5, 2005, Conyers and 88 other members of Congress wrote an open letter to the White House inquiring about the [[Downing Street memo]]. This was a leaked memorandum that revealed an apparent secret agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom to [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|attack Iraq]] in 2002. ''[[The Times]]'' reported that newly discovered documents reveal British and U.S. intentions to invade Iraq and leaders of the two countries had "discussed creating pretextual justifications for doing so."<ref name=thetimes />

The memo story broke in the United Kingdom, but did not receive much coverage in the United States. Conyers said: "This should not be allowed to fall down the memory hole during wall-to-wall coverage of the [[People v. Jackson|Michael Jackson trial]] and a [[Jennifer Wilbanks|runaway bride]]."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Brown, Jr.|first=Sylvester|title=Conyers looks for news in the wrong place|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=May 15, 2005|page=D2}}</ref> Conyers and others reportedly considered sending a congressional investigation delegation to London.<ref name=thetimes>Tony Allen-Mills and Tom Pattinson, "[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1622378,00.html Blair faces U.S. probe over secret Iraq invasion plan]", ''The Times'', May 22, 2005.</ref>

=== ''What Went Wrong in Ohio'' ===

In May 2005, Conyers released ''What Went Wrong in Ohio: The Conyers Report On The 2004 Presidential Election.'' This dealt with the [[2004 United States election voting controversies|voting irregularities]] in the state of [[Ohio]] during the [[2004 U.S. Presidential Election]]. The evidence offered consists of statistical abnormalities in the differences between [[exit poll]] results and actual votes registered at those locations. The book also discusses reports of faulty [[electronic voting]] machines and the lack of credibility of those machines used to tally votes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vidal |first=Gore |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/something-rotten-ohio/ |title=Something Rotten in Ohio |work=The Nation |date=June 9, 2005 |access-date=October 28, 2019}}</ref>

Conyers was one of 31 members of the House who voted not to count the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] from [[Ohio]] in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web|date=January 6, 2005|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml|title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 7|publisher=clerk.house.gov|access-date=February 22, 2008}}</ref>

=== Constitution in Crisis ===

[[File:NLN John Conyers.jpg|thumb|Conyers at an [[Protests against the Iraq War|anti-war march]] in Newark, New Jersey, in 2007]]

On August 4, 2006, Conyers released his report, ''The Constitution in Crisis: The Downing Street Minutes and Deception, Manipulation, Torture, Retributions and Cover-ups in the Iraq War'', an edited collection of information intended to serve as evidence that the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] altered [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] to justify the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Rep.

''The Constitution in Crisis'' examines much of the evidence presented by the Bush Administration prior to the invasion and questions the credibility of their sources of intelligence. In addition, the document investigates conditions that led to the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|torture scandal]] at [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in Iraq, as well as further evidence of [[torture]] having been committed but not made known to the public. Finally, the document reports on a series of "smear tactics" purportedly used by the administration in dealing with its political adversaries. The document calls for the [[censure]] of President [[George W. Bush]] and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]. Conyers refused to back [[Efforts to impeach George W. Bush|impeachment]] proceedings, however.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2005/12/20/Conyers-seeks-to-censure-Bush-in-Congress/21221135131963/?ur3=1 |title=Conyers seeks to censure Bush in Congress |agency=United Press International |date=December 20, 2005 |access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref>

=== On anti-Muslim intolerance ===

Conyers proposed House Resolution 288, which condemns "religious intolerance" and emphasizes [[Islam]] as needing special protection from acts of violence and intolerance. It states that "it should never be official policy of the United States Government to disparage the [[Quran]], Islam, or any religion in any way, shape, or form," and "calls upon local, State, and Federal authorities to work to prevent [[hate crime|bias-motivated crimes]] and acts against all individuals, including those of the Islamic faith." The bill was referred to the House subcommittee on the Constitution in June 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.res.00288: |title=H.Res.288 – 109th Congress (2005–2006): Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives condemning bigotry and religious intolerance, and recognizing that holy books of every religion should be treated with dignity and respect. &#124; Congress.gov &#124; Library of Congress |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=May 19, 2005 |access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref>

In 2005, Conyers introduced House Resolution 160, a house resolution that would have condemned the conduct of [[Narendra Modi]], then the [[Chief Minister of Gujarat|chief minister]] of the [[State of Gujarat]] in India. The resolution was cosponsored by Republican Representative [[Joseph R. Pitts]] (Republican of Pennsylvania). The resolution's title was: "Condemning the conduct of Chief Minister Narendra Modi for his actions to incite religious persecution and urging the United States to condemn all violations of [[religious freedom in India]]." The resolution cited a 2004 [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] report on Modi stating that he was "widely accused of being reluctant to bring the perpetrators of the killings of Muslims and non-Hindus to justice". (See [[2002 Gujarat riots]].) The resolution was not adopted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressional Record, Text of H.RES.160|date=March 16, 2005|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-resolution/160/text |access-date=July 12, 2016}}</ref>

=== Conyers v. Bush ===

{{Main|Conyers v. Bush}}

In April 2006 Conyers, together with ten other senior [[Member of Congress|congressmen]], filed an action in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division]], challenging the constitutionality of the [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]]. The complaint alleged the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was not afforded due consideration by the [[United States Congress]] before being signed by the President.<ref>[http://www.elderlawanswers.com/resources/article.asp?id=5988&section=4&state= ''The DRA One Year Later: Dems Waiting for Outcome of Legal Challenges to Law That Stiffens Medicaid Transfer Penalties''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927144002/http://www.elderlawanswers.com/resources/article.asp?id=5988&section=4&state= |date=September 27, 2007}} from [http://www.ElderLawAnswers.com ElderLawAnswers.com], February 10, 2007</ref> The action was subsequently dismissed on grounds of lack of [[Standing (law)|standing]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2633701|title=Judge Dismisses Budget Bill Lawsuit|date=November 6, 2006|access-date=November 28, 2006|work=ABC News|agency=Associated Press|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203215630/https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2633701|archive-date=February 3, 2009}}</ref>

=== Ethics controversy ===

In April 2006, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the U.S. Attorney's office sent independent letters to the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]], saying two former aides of Conyers had alleged that Conyers used his staff to work on several local and state campaigns of other politicians{{snd}}including [[Monica Conyers|his wife]]{{snd}}for the [[Detroit City Council]]. (She won a seat in 2005.) He also forced them to baby-sit and chauffeur his children.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/12/griffin.conyers/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Congressman accused of using staff to baby-sit|date=April 12, 2006|access-date=May 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Civilian Employee Held Hostage at Baltimore Police Station; Moussaoui Testifies; 9/11: Delayed Death; Congressional Baby Sitter |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0604/13/lol.05.html |access-date=January 14, 2019 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=April 13, 2006 |quote=When it came to Conyers, staff members said doing errands and babysitting were only the half of it.

In late December 2006, Conyers "accepted responsibility" for violating House rules. A statement issued December 29, 2006, by the House Ethics Committee chairman [[Doc Hastings]] and Ranking Minority Member [[Howard Berman]], said Conyers acknowledged what he characterized as a "lack of clarity" in his communications with staff members regarding their official duties and responsibilities, and accepted responsibility for his actions.<ref name=ethicsviolation />

In deciding to drop the matter, Hastings and Berman said:
{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |After reviewing the information gathered during the inquiry, and in light of Representative Conyers's cooperation with the inquiry, we have concluded that this matter should be resolved through the issuance of this public statement and the agreement by Representative Conyers to take a number of additional, significant steps to ensure that his office complies with all rules and standards regarding campaign and personal work by congressional staff.<ref name=ethicsviolation>[http://www.thehill.com:8888/thehill/opencms/TheHill/News/Frontpage/121306/conyers.html Conyers accepts responsibility for possible ethics violations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102065507/http://www.thehill.com:8888/thehill/opencms/TheHill/News/Frontpage/121306/conyers.html |date=January 2, 2007|work=The Hill}}.

=== Copyright bill ===

Conyers repeatedly introduced the [[Fair Copyright in Research Works Act]], a bill that would overturn the [[NIH Public Access Policy]], an [[open-access mandate]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]]. Conyers's bill would forbid the government from mandating that federally funded research be made freely available to the public.<ref>[http://www.techlawjournal.com/topstories/2009/20090203.asp Conyers Reintroduces Fair Copyright in Research Works Act], ''Tech Law Journal'' (February 3, 2009).</ref> The legislation was supported by the publishing industry,<ref>John Willinsky, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2631074/ The Publishers' Pushback against NIH's Public Access and Scholarly Publishing Sustainability], [[PLOS Biology]], January 2009; 7(1): e30.</ref> and opposed by groups such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].<ref>Richard Esguerra, [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/02/open-access-policies-threatened-copyright-bill "Open Access" Policies Threatened by Copyright Bill], Electronic Frontier Foundation (February 25, 2009).</ref> Writers [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Michael Eisen]] accused Conyers of being influenced by publishing houses, who have contributed significant money to his campaigns.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-lessig-and-michael-eisen/is-john-conyers-shilling_b_171189.html|author=Lawrence Lessig and Michael Eisen|title=Is John Conyers Shilling for Special Interests?|work=HuffPost|date= March 2, 2009|access-date=August 23, 2010}}</ref>

=== House Report on George W. Bush presidency and proposed inquiry ===

On January 13, 2009, the House Committee on the Judiciary, led by Conyers, released ''Reining in the Imperial Presidency: Lessons and Recommendations Relating to the Presidency of George W. Bush'', a 486-page report detailing alleged abuses of power that occurred during the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]], and a comprehensive set of recommendations to prevent recurrence. Conyers introduced a bill to set up a "truth commission" panel to investigate alleged policy abuses of the Bush administration.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/a-truth-commission-for-the-bush-era|title=A Truth Commission for the Bush Era? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 2, 2009|access-date=March 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR00104:@@@D&summ2=m& |title=H.R.104 &#124; To establish a national commission on presidential war powers and civil liberties|publisher=Thomas.loc.gov|access-date=March 23, 2011|date=June 12, 2009}}</ref>

=== Bill reading controversy ===

In late July 2009, Conyers, commenting on the [[Health care in the United States|healthcare debate]] in the [[United States House|House]], stated: "I love these members, they get up and say, 'Read the bill'{{nbs}}... What good is reading the bill if it's a thousand pages and you don't have two days and two lawyers to find out what it means after you read the bill?" His remark brought criticism from [[government transparency]] advocates such as the [[Sunlight Foundation]], which referred to readthebill.org<ref>{{cite web|title=ReadTheBill|url=http://readthebill.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610070041/http://readthebill.org/|archive-date=June 10, 2009}}</ref> in response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/07/27/rep-conyers-dont-read-the-bill|author=Paul Blumenthal|title=Rep.

=== Response to accusations regarding American Muslim spies ===

In October, Conyers responded to allegations from four Republican Congress Members, in the wake of the launch of the book ''[[Muslim Mafia]]'', that the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) sought to plant Muslim "spies" in [[Capitol Hill]]. He strongly opposed the accusations, saying:

{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |It shouldn't need to be said in 2009, and after the historic election of our first African-American president, but let me remind all my colleagues that patriotic Americans of all races, religions, and beliefs have the right{{snd}}and the responsibility{{snd}}to participate in our political process, including by volunteering to work in Congressional offices.

{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |As an initial matter, there is no doubt that WikiLeaks is very unpopular right now. Many feel that the WikiLeaks publication was offensive.

Conyers's statement was "in marked contrast to the repeated calls from other members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] officials to prosecute WikiLeaks head [[Julian Assange]] immediately."<ref name=WikiHearing />

=== Criticism of American foreign policy ===

Conyers and his Republican colleague [[Ted Yoho]] offered bipartisan amendments to block the U.S. military training of Ukraine's [[Azov Battalion]] of the [[Territorial defense battalions (Ukraine)|Ukrainian National Guard]]. Some members of the battalion are openly white supremacists.<ref>"[http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-06-12/ukraine-s-neo-nazis-won-t-get-u-s-money Ukraine's Neo-Nazis Won't Get U.S. Money]".

== Political positions ==

According to ''The New Republic'', Conyers was a member of the [[Democratic Socialists of America]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/122285/bernie-burlington|title=Bernie of Burlington|date=March 14, 1983|first=Jon|last=Margolis|work=[[The New Republic]]|access-date=September 21, 2018}}</ref>

Conyers supported legislation aimed at strengthening the U.S. civil justice system. In March 2016, Rep. Conyers and Representative [[Hank Johnson]] introduced legislation to protect consumers access to civil courts, titled the "Restoring Statutory Rights Act." This legislation would "ensure that the state, federal, and constitutional rights of Americans are enforceable" and consumers aren't forced into secretive private arbitration hearings.<ref>{{Cite press release|url=https://hankjohnson.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/conyers-and-johnson-introduce-legislation-equalize-women-s-pay-end|title=Conyers and Johnson Introduce Legislation to Equalize Women's Pay, End Forced Arbitration|date=April 12, 2016}}</ref>

== Detroit mayoral campaigns ==

While serving in the U.S. House, Conyers made two unsuccessful runs for [[mayor of Detroit]]: one in 1989 against incumbent [[Coleman Young]] and again in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0207/2635.html |title=In Mayor's Races, Capitol Hill Often Doesn't Lead to City Hall |work=Politico | date=May 2, 2007}}</ref>

=== 1989 ===

Incumbent Democratic Mayor Coleman Young decided to run for a fifth term, despite growing unpopularity and the declining economy of Detroit. In the September primary, Young won with 51% of the vote. Accountant Tom Barrow qualified for the November run-off by having 24%, and Conyers received 18% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/14/us/detroit-mayor-easily-wins-primary-but-faces-runoff.html?src=pm | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Detroit Mayor Easily Wins Primary but Faces Runoff | date=September 14, 1989}}</ref> Despite the difficulties of the city, Young defeated Barrow in the run-off with 56% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED3D0AF33EA984C&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Detroit's Young wins again|work=The Dallas Morning News|date=November 8, 1989}}</ref>

=== 1993 ===

In June 1993, incumbent Democratic Mayor Coleman Young decided to retire instead of seeking a sixth term, citing his age and health. Many observers believed he had decided not to test his growing unpopularity. In a ''[[Detroit News]]'' poll in February, 81% said Young should retire.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72163622.html?dids=72163622:72163622&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+23%2C+1993&author=Edward+Walsh&pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=Detroit+Mayor+Bars+New+Race%3B+Scramble+to+Succeed+Young+Is+Assured&pqatl=google | first=Edward | last=Walsh | title=Detroit Mayor Bars New Race; Scramble to Succeed Young Is Assured|date=June 23, 1993}}</ref> Conyers was one of the 23 candidates who qualified for ballot access.<!-- Explain how --><ref>{{Cite news|last=Holewa|first=Lisa|title=23 candidates hope to replace Detroit mayor|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jpIiAAAAIBAJ&pg=2980,3555375&dq=john+conyers+mayor&hl=en|newspaper=The Item|date=September 14, 1993}}</ref>

[[Dennis Archer]] was the front runner in the mayoral campaign from the beginning. The 51-year-old former [[Michigan Supreme Court|State Supreme Court Justice]] raised over $1.6{{nbs}}million to finance his campaign. He won the September primary with 54% of the vote. Conyers came in fourth place.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/13/us/as-mayor-of-20-years-retires-detroit-faces-a-new-kind-of-election.html?src=pm|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=As Mayor of 20 Years Retires, Detroit Faces a New Kind of Election|date=September 13, 1993}}</ref> Archer won the November election.
