* the '''People's Republic of China''' ('''PRC'''), commonly known as "[[China]]"
* the '''Republic of China''' ('''ROC'''), commonly known as "[[Taiwan]]"

Their relationship is complex and controversial due to the dispute on the [[political status of Taiwan]] after the administration of Taiwan was transferred from Japan at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945 and the subsequent split of [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] into the above two in 1949 as a result of [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]], and hinges on two key questions: whether the two entities are two separate countries (either as "Taiwan" and "China" or [[Two Chinas]]: "Republic of China" and "People's Republic of China") or two "regions" or parts of the same country (i.e. "[[One-China policy|One China]]") with rivaling governments.  The English expression "cross-Strait relations" is considered to be a neutral term which avoids reference to the political status of either side.

At the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, the administration of Taiwan was transferred to the Republic of China (ROC) from the [[Empire of Japan]], though legal questions remain regarding the language in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]].  In 1949, with the [[Chinese Civil War]] turning decisively in favour of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), the Republic of China government led by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) retreated to [[Taiwan]] and established the provisional capital in Taipei, while the CPC proclaimed the People's Republic of China (PRC) government in [[Beijing]].  No armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed and debate continues as to whether the civil war has legally ended.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Contemporary Law of Armed Conflict |first = Leslie C. |last = Green |page = 79 }}</ref>

Since then, the relations between the governments in Beijing and Taipei have been characterized by limited contact, tensions, and instability.  In the early years, military conflicts continued, while diplomatically both governments competed to be the "[[One-China policy|legitimate government]] of China".  Since the democratization of Taiwan, the question regarding the [[political status of Taiwan|political and legal status of Taiwan]] has shifted focus to the choice between [[Chinese unification|political unification with mainland China]] or ''de jure'' [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese independence]]. The PRC remains hostile to any formal declaration of independence and maintains its claim over Taiwan.

At the same time, non-governmental and semi-governmental exchanges between the two sides have increased. From 2008, negotiations began to restore the [[Three Links]] (postal, transportation, trade) between the two sides, cut off since 1949. Diplomatic contact between the two sides has generally been limited to [[Kuomintang]] administrations on Taiwan.  However, during [[Democratic Progressive Party]] administrations, negotiations continue to occur on practical matters through informal channels.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=I-chia |title=Virus Outbreak: Flights bring 361 Taiwanese home |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/03/12/2003732546 |accessdate=7 June 2020 |work=[[Taipei Times]] |date=12 March 2020}}</ref>

In 1624, the Dutch established their first settlement in Taiwan. In 1662, [[Koxinga]] (Zheng Chenggong), a [[Ming dynasty]] loyalist, defeated the Dutch rulers of Taiwan, and took the island, establishing the first formally [[Han Chinese]] regime in Taiwan. Koxinga's heirs used Taiwan as a base for launching raids into mainland China against the [[Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]]. However, they were defeated in 1683 by [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] forces. The following year, Taiwan was incorporated into [[Fujian province]]. Over the next two centuries, the Imperial government paid little attention to Taiwan.{{Citation needed |date = May 2009}}

The situation changed in the 19th century, with other powers increasingly eyeing Taiwan for its strategic location and resources. In response, the administration began to implement a modernization drive. In 1887, [[Fujian-Taiwan Province]] was declared by Imperial decree. Within 10 years, Taiwan had become one of the most modern provinces in the Empire.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} However, the fall of the Qing outpaced the development of Taiwan, and in 1895, following its defeat in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the Imperial government ceded Taiwan to [[Japan]] in perpetuity. Qing loyalists briefly resisted the Japanese rule under the banner of the "[[Republic of Taiwan (1895)|Republic of Taiwan]]", but were quickly put down by Japanese authorities.{{sfnp|Morris|2002|pp=4–18}}

Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945. During this time, Taiwan, as part of the Japanese Empire, was a foreign jurisdiction in relation to first the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]], and, after 1912, the [[Republic of China]]. In 1945, Japan was defeated in [[World War II]] and surrendered its forces in Taiwan to the Allies, with the ROC, then ruled by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), taking custody of the island. The period of post-war Kuomintang rule over China (1945–1949) was marked in Taiwan by conflict between local residents and the new KMT authority.  The Taiwanese rebelled against on 28 February 1947 in the [[February 28 incident]], which was put down violently by the KMT. The seeds for the Taiwan independence movement were sown in this time.

China was soon engulfed in [[Chinese Civil War|full-scale civil war]]. In 1949, the war turned decisively against the KMT and in favor of the CPC. On 1 October 1949, the CPC under Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] in [[Beijing]]. The [[capitalist]] ROC government retreated to Taiwan, eventually declaring [[Taipei]] its temporary capital in December 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1031.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228172408/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1031.html |archive-date=2017-02-28 }}</ref>

=== Military stalemate to diplomatic war (1949–1979) ===
[[File:U.S. President Eisenhower visited TAIWAN 美國總統艾森豪於1960年6月訪問臺灣台北時與蔣中正總統-2.jpg|275px|right|thumb|U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], riding with President Chiang Kai-shek, waves to onlookers during his visit to [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]] in June 1960.]]

The two governments continued in a state of war until 1979. In October 1949, PRC's attempt to take the ROC controlled island of [[Kinmen]] was thwarted in the [[Battle of Kuningtou]], halting the PLA advance towards Taiwan.<ref name="QiB">Qi, Bangyuan.

In June 1949, the ROC declared a "closure" of all Chinese ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships. The closure covered from a point north of the mouth of [[Min River (Fujian)|Min river]] in [[Fujian province]] to the mouth of the [[Liao River]] in Manchuria.<ref name="Tsang">Tsang, Steve Yui-Sang Tsang.

Tauris. {{ISBN|1-85043-842-0}}. p 155, p 115-120, p 139-145</ref> Since China's railroad network was underdeveloped, north–south trade depended heavily on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for Chinese fishermen.

After losing China, a group of approximately 12,000 KMT soldiers escaped to [[Burma]] and continued launching guerrilla attacks into southern China. Their leader, General [[Li Mi (ROC general)|Li Mi]], was paid a salary by the ROC government and given the nominal title of Governor of [[Yunnan]]. Initially, the United States supported these remnants and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] provided them with aid. After the Burmese government appealed to the [[United Nations]] in 1953, the U.S. began pressuring the ROC to withdraw its loyalists. By the end of 1954, nearly 6,000 soldiers had left Burma and Li Mi declared his army disbanded. However, thousands remained, and the ROC continued to supply and command them, even secretly supplying reinforcements at times.

The [[Kuomintang Islamic Insurgency in China (1950–1958)]] was fought by Muslim Kuomintang army officers who refused to surrender to the communists throughout the 1950s and 60's.

During the [[Korean War]], some captured Communist Chinese soldiers, many of whom were originally KMT soldiers, were repatriated to Taiwan rather than China. A KMT guerrilla force continued to operate cross-border raids into south-western China in the early 1950s. The ROC government launched a number of air bombing raids into key coastal cities of China such as [[Shanghai]].

Though viewed as a military liability by the United States, the ROC viewed its remaining islands in [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian]] as vital for any future campaign to defeat the PRC and retake China. On 3 September 1954, the [[First Taiwan Strait crisis]] began when the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] started shelling [[Quemoy]] and threatened to take the [[Dachen Islands]].<ref name="Tsang" /> On 20 January 1955, the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] took nearby [[Yijiangshan Island]], with the entire ROC garrison of 720 troops killed or wounded defending the island. On January 24 of the same year, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Formosa Resolution]] authorizing the President to defend the ROC's offshore islands.<ref name="Tsang" /> The First Taiwan Straits crisis ended in March 1955 when the PLA ceased its bombardment. The crisis was brought to a close during the [[Asian-African Conference|Bandung conference]].<ref name="Tsang" />

The [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]] began on 23 August 1958 with air and naval engagements between the PRC and the ROC military forces, leading to intense artillery bombardment of [[Kinmen|Quemoy]] (by the PRC) and [[Xiamen|Amoy]] (by the ROC), and ended on November of the same year.<ref name="Tsang" /> PLA patrol boats blockaded the islands from ROC supply ships. Though the United States rejected Chiang Kai-shek's proposal to bomb Chinese artillery batteries, it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to the ROC. It also provided [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] ships to land supply, as a sunken ROC naval vessel was blocking the harbor. On September 7, the United States escorted a convoy of ROC supply ships and the PRC refrained from firing. On October 25, the PRC announced an "even-day ceasefire" — the PLA would only shell Quemoy on odd-numbered days.

Despite the end of the hostilities, the two sides have never signed any agreement or treaty to officially end the war.

After the 1950s, the "war" became more symbolic than real, represented by on again, off again artillery bombardment towards and from [[Kinmen]]. In later years, live shells were replaced with propaganda sheets. The bombardment finally ceased in 1979 after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States.{{Citation needed |date = March 2019}}

During this period, movement of people and goods virtually ceased between PRC- and ROC-controlled territories. There were occasional defectors. One high-profile defector was [[Justin Yifu Lin]], who swam across the Kinmen strait to China and was Chief Economist and Senior Vice President of the [[World Bank]] from 2008 to 2012.

Most observers expected Chiang's government to eventually fall in response to a Communist invasion of Taiwan, and the United States initially showed no interest in supporting Chiang's government in its final stand. Things changed radically with the onset of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950. At this point, allowing a total Communist victory over Chiang became politically impossible in the United States, and President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] into the [[Taiwan strait]]s to prevent the ROC and PRC from attacking each other.<ref name="BushR">Bush, Richard C. [2005] (2005).

After the ROC complained to the [[United Nations]] against the [[Soviet Union]] supporting the PRC, the [[UN General Assembly Resolution 505]] was adopted on 1 February 1952 to condemn the Soviet Union.

Diplomatically during this period, until around 1971, the ROC government continued to be recognized as the legitimate government of China and Taiwan by most NATO governments. The PRC government was recognized by Soviet Bloc countries, members of the non-aligned movement, and some Western nations such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Both governments claimed to be the legitimate government of China, and labeled the other as illegitimate. Civil war propaganda permeated the education curriculum. Each side portrayed the people of the other as living in hell-like misery. In official media, each side called the other "bandits". The ROC also suppressed expressions of support for Taiwanese identity or Taiwan independence.

Both ROC and PRC engaged in proxy warfare in other countries to gain influence and allies. They would either have proxy forces or provide military aid or support during the conflict, to support their interests. Some notable conflicts include: [[Internal conflict in Myanmar]], [[Korean War]], [[Laotian Civil War]], [[Hong Kong 1956 riots]], [[Communist insurgency in Thailand]], [[12-3 incident]], [[Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots]] and [[NDF Rebellion]]

===Thawing of relations (1979–1998)===
{{Unreferenced section |date = May 2009}}
[[File:Taiwan Strait.png|thumb|right|The [[Taiwan Strait]]]]
Following the break of official relations between the United States and the ROC in 1979, the ROC government under [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] maintained a "[[Three Noes]]" policy in regards to communicating with the Chinese government. This policy however was revised following the May 1986 [[China Airlines Flight 334|hijacking of a China Airlines cargo plane]], in which the Taiwanese pilot subdued other members of the crew and flew the plane to [[Guangzhou]]. In response, Chiang sent delegates to [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] to discuss with PRC officials for the return of the plane and crew, which is seen as a turning point between cross-strait relations.

In 1987, the ROC government began to allow visits to China. This benefited many, especially old KMT soldiers, who had been separated from their family in China for decades. This also proved a catalyst for the thawing of relations between the two sides. Problems engendered by increased contact necessitated a mechanism for regular negotiations.

In 1988, a guideline, [[22 point regulation]], was approved by PRC to encourage ROC investments in the PRC. It guaranteed ROC establishments would not be nationalized, and that exports were free from tariffs, ROC businessmen would be granted multiple visas for easy movement.

In order to negotiate with China on operational issues without compromising the government's position on denying the other side's legitimacy, the ROC government under [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] created the "[[Straits Exchange Foundation]]" (SEF), a nominally non-governmental institution directly led by the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], an instrument of the [[Executive Yuan]]. The PRC responded to this initiative by setting up the [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] (ARATS), directly led by the [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].  This system, described as "white gloves", allowed the two governments to engage with each other on a semi-official basis without compromising their respective sovereignty policies.

Led by highly respected elder statesmen [[Koo Chen-fu]] and [[Wang Daohan]], the two organizations began a series of talks that culminated in the 1992 meetings, which, together with subsequent correspondence, may have established the [[1992 Consensus]], under which both sides agreed to deliberate ambiguity on questions of sovereignty, in order to engage on operational questions affecting both sides.

Also during this time, however, the rhetoric of ROC President [[Lee Tung-hui]] began to turn further towards Taiwan independence. Prior to the 1990s, the ROC had been a one-party authoritarian state committed to eventual unification with China.  However, with democratic reforms the attitudes of the general public began to influence policy in Taiwan. As a result, the ROC government shifted away from its commitment to the [[one China policy]] and towards a separate political identity for Taiwan. The [[People's Liberation Army]] attempted to influence the 1996 ROC election in Taiwan by conducting a missile exercise designed to warn the pro-independence [[Pan-Green Coalition]], leading to the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]]. By 1998, semi-official talks had broken down.

=== Hostile non-contact (1998–2008) ===
{{More citations needed section |date = May 2009}}
[[File:Taipei Station with UN-for-Taiwan banner 20080318.jpg|thumb|[[United Nations]] for Taiwan banner at [[Taipei Railway Station]].]]
[[Chen Shui-bian]] was elected [[President of the Republic of China|President of the ROC]] in 2000.  Politically, Chen is strongly pro-[[Taiwan independence]].  Chen's repudiation of the [[1992 Consensus]] combined with the PRC's insistence that the ROC agree to the [[One-China Policy|"one China" principle]] for negotiations to occur prevented improvement in cross-strait relations.

[[Hu Jintao]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] in late 2002, who succeeded [[Jiang Zemin]] as ''de facto'' [[paramount leader]] of China.

Chen called for talks without any preconditions, repudiating the [[1992 consensus]] while Hu continued to insist that talks can only proceed under an agreement of the "one China" principle. Chen Shui-bian and [[Democratic Progressive Party|his party]] continued to express an ultimate goal of formal Taiwanese independence, and make statements on the [[political status of Taiwan]] that the PRC considers provocative. At the same time, Hu and the PRC continued a military missile buildup across the strait from Taiwan while making threats of military action against Taiwan should it declare independence or if the PRC considers that all possibilities for a peaceful unification are completely exhausted. The PRC also continued applying diplomatic pressure to other nations to isolate the ROC diplomatically.{{Citation needed |date = May 2009}}

Despite these provocations, in 2001 Chen lifted the 50-year ban on direct trade and investment with the PRC, which made the later [[Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement|ECFA]] possible.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan – timeline |publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2011 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1286033.stm |accessdate=2012-01-06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209042911/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1286033.stm |archive-date=9 December 2011 }}</ref>  During the 2003 Iraq war, the PRC allowed [[List of airlines of Taiwan|Taiwanese airlines]] use of China's airspace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-08/18/content_470025.htm |title=Mainland scrambles to help Taiwan airlines |accessdate=3 April 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083532/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-08/18/content_470025.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>

After the re-election of [[Chen Shui-bian]] in 2004, Hu's government changed the previous blanket no-contact policy, a holdover from the [[Jiang Zemin]] administration. Under the new policy, on the one hand, the PRC government continued a no-contact policy towards Chen Shui-bian. It maintained its military build-up against Taiwan, and pursued a vigorous policy of isolating Taiwan diplomatically. In March 2005, the [[Anti-Secession Law]] was passed by the [[National People's Congress]], formalizing "non-peaceful means" as an option of response to a formal declaration of independence in Taiwan.{{Citation needed |date = May 2009}}

On the other hand, the PRC administration loosened its rhetoric in relation to Taiwan,{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} and pursued contact with apolitical, or politically non-independence leaning, groups in Taiwan. In his [[May 17 Statement]] in 2004, Hu Jintao made friendly overtures to Taiwan on resuming negotiations for the "[[three links]]", reducing misunderstandings, and increasing consultation. In the [[Anti-Secession Law]] passed in 2005, the PRC government for the first time authoritatively committed to negotiations on the basis of equal status between the two sides, and further refrained from imposing the "one China" policy as a precondition for talks. The CPC increased contacts on a party-to-party basis with the KMT, then the opposition party in Taiwan. Despite having been the warring parties in the Chinese Civil War, the CPC and the KMT also have a history of co-operation, when the two parties twice co-operated in the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] and [[Second Sino-Japanese War|the war against Japan]]; in addition, both parties, for a variety of historic and ideological reasons, adhere to their respective versions of a [[one China policy]].

=== Resumption of high level contact (2008–2016) ===

A series of meetings between the two sides have followed. On 12 April 2008, Hu Jintao held a meeting with ROC's then vice-president elect [[Vincent Siew]] as chairman of the [[Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation]] during the [[Boao Forum for Asia]].  On 28 May 2008, Hu met with former KMT chairman [[Wu Po-hsiung]], the first meeting between the heads of the CPC and the KMT as ruling parties. During this meeting, Hu and Wu agreed that both sides should recommence semi-official dialogue under the [[1992 consensus]]. Wu committed the KMT against Taiwanese independence, but also stressed that a "Taiwan identity" did not equate to "Taiwanese independence". Hu committed his government to addressing the concerns of the Taiwanese people in regard to security, dignity, and "international living space", with a priority given to discussing Taiwan's wish to participate in the [[World Health Organization]].

Both Hu and his new counterpart [[Ma Ying-jeou]] agree that the [[1992 Consensus]] is the basis for negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan strait. On 26 March 2008, Hu Jintao held a telephone talk with the US President [[George W. Bush]], in which he explained that the "[[1992 Consensus]]" sees "both sides recognize there is only one China, but agree to differ on its definition".<ref>{{cite news|title=Chinese, U.S. presidents hold telephone talks on Taiwan, Tibet |publisher=Xinhuanet |date=27 March 2008 |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-03/27/content_7865209.htm |accessdate=2008-05-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512002546/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-03/27/content_7865209.htm |archive-date=12 May 2008 }}</ref> The first priority for the SEF–ARATS meeting will be opening of the [[three links]], especially direct flights between China and Taiwan.

These events suggest a policy by the two sides to rely on the deliberate ambiguity of the [[1992 Consensus]] to avoid difficulties arising from asserting [[sovereignty]]. As Wu Po-hsiung put it during a press conference in his 2008 China visit, "we do not refer to the 'Republic of China' so long as the other side does not refer to the 'People's Republic of China'". Since the March elections in Taiwan, the PRC government has not mentioned the "[[one China policy]]" in any official announcements. The only exception has been one brief aberration in a press release by the Ministry of Commerce, which described Vincent Siew as agreeing to the "[[1992 consensus]] and the "[[one China policy]]". Upon an immediate protest from Siew, the PRC side retracted the press release and issued apologetic statements emphasizing that only press releases published by the [[Xinhua News Agency]] represented the official PRC position. The official press release on this event did not mention the One China Policy.<ref>{{cite news |script-title=zh:胡锦涛会见萧万长 就两岸经济交流合作交换意见 |trans-title=Hu Jintao meets Vincent Siew; they exchanged opinions on cross-Strait economic exchange and co-operation |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=12 April 2008 |url=http://www.gov.cn/ldhd/2008-04/12/content_943267.htm |accessdate=2008-06-02 |language=zh |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421033522/http://www.gov.cn/ldhd/2008-04/12/content_943267.htm |archive-date=21 April 2008 }}</ref>

Former ROC President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] has advocated that cross-strait relations should shift from "mutual non-recognition" to "mutual non-denial".<ref>{{cite web |title=晤諾貝爾得主 馬再拋兩岸互不否認 (Meeting Nobel laureates, Ma again speaks of mutual non-denial) |work=Liberty Times |date=19 April 2008 |url=https://www.libertytimes.com/2008/new/apr/19/today-p3.htm |accessdate=2008-06-02 |language=zh |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525092217/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/apr/19/today-p3.htm |archive-date=25 May 2008 }}</ref>

Dialogue through semi-official organisations (the SEF and the ARATS) reopened on 12 June 2008 on the basis of the [[1992 Consensus]], with the first meeting held in Beijing. Neither the PRC nor the ROC recognizes the other side as a legitimate entity, so the dialogue was in the name of contacts between the SEF and the ARATS instead of the two governments, though most participants were actually officials in PRC or ROC governments.

In April 2018, political parties and organizations demanding a referendum on Taiwan's independence have formed an alliance to further their initiative. The [[Formosa Alliance]] was established, prompted by a sense of crisis in the face of growing pressure from China for unification. The alliance wants to hold a referendum on Taiwan's independence in April 2019, change the island's name from the Republic of China to Taiwan, and apply for membership in the [[United Nations]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Ihara |first=Kensaku |date=9 April 2018 |title=Pro-independence forces in Taiwan align to push referendum |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Pro-independence-forces-in-Taiwan-align-to-push-referendum |work=Nikkei Asian Review |location=Japan |access-date=16 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506173959/https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Pro-independence-forces-in-Taiwan-align-to-push-referendum |archive-date=6 May 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In May 2018, China engaged in military exercises around Taiwan to pressure Taiwan not to become independent.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |agency=Associated Press |date=16 May 2018 |title=China says military exercises intended to threaten Taiwan |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/05/16/china-says-military-exercises-intended-to-threaten-taiwan.html |work=Fox News |location=United States |access-date=16 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516074012/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/05/16/china-says-military-exercises-intended-to-threaten-taiwan.html |archive-date=16 May 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Interpretation of the relations by sitting leaders ===
{{See also|Political status of Taiwan}}

Presidents [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] have steadily maintained that there is only one China, the sole representative of which was the ROC, and that the PRC government was illegitimate, while PRC leaders have maintained the converse that the PRC was the sole representative of China.  In 1979, [[Deng Xiaoping]] proposed a model for the incorporation of Taiwan into the [[People's Republic of China]] which involved a high degree of autonomy within the Chinese state, similar to the model proposed to [[Hong Kong]] which would eventually become [[one country, two systems]].  On 26 June 1983, Deng proposed a meeting between the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]] as equal political parties and on 22 February, he officially proposed the [[one country, two systems]] model.  In September 1990, under the presidency of [[Lee Teng-hui]], the [[National Unification Council]] was established in Taiwan and in January 1991, the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] was established; in March 1991, the "Guidelines for National Unification" were adopted and on 30 April 1991, the [[period of mobilization for the suppression of Communist rebellion]] was terminated.  Thereafter, the two sides conducted several rounds of negotiations through the informal [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] and [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]].<ref name="sheng">{{cite book |last1=Sheng |first1=Lijun |title=China and Taiwan: Cross-strait Relations Under Chen Shui-bian |date=2002 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |location=Singapore |isbn=1-84277-318-6 |pages=7–8}}</ref>

On 22 May 1995, the [[United States]] granted [[Lee Teng-hui]] a visit to his alma mater, [[Cornell University]], which resulted in the suspension of cross-strait exchanges by China, as well as the subsequent [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]].  Lee was labelled as a "traitor" attempting to "split China" by the PRC.<ref>{{cite web

  }}</ref>  In an interview on 9 July 1999, President [[Lee Teng-hui]] defined the relations between Taiwan and mainland China as "between two countries (國家), at least special relations between two countries," and that there was no need for the Republic of China to declare independence since it had been independent since 1912 (the founding date of the Republic of China), thereby identifying the Taiwanese state with the Republic of China.  Later, the MAC published an English translation of Lee's remarks referring instead to "two states of one nation," later changed on 22 July to "special state-to-state relations."  In response, China denounced the theory and demanded retractions.  Lee began to backpedal from his earlier marks, emphasizing the [[1992 consensus]], whereby representatives from the two sides agreed that there was only one China, of which Taiwan was a part.  However, the ROC maintained that the two sides agreed to disagree about which government represented China, whereas the PRC maintains that the two sides agreed that the PRC was the sole representative of China.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sheng |first1=Lijun |title=China and Taiwan: Cross-strait Relations Under Chen Shui-bian |date=2002 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |location=Singapore |isbn=1-84277-318-6 |pages=11–15}}</ref>

On August 3, 2002, president [[Chen Shui-bian]] defined the relationship as [[One Country on Each Side]].  The PRC subsequently cut off official contact with the ROC government.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Glaser |first1=Bonnie |title=China's Taiwan Policy in the Wake of "One Country on Each Side" |journal=The Journal of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy |date=30 November 2010 |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=515–524 |doi=10.1080/10803920216379|s2cid=154365745 }}</ref>

The ROC position under President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] backpedaled to a weaker version of Lee Teng-hui's position.  On 2 September 2008, former ROC President Ma Ying-jeou was interviewed by the Mexico-based newspaper [[Organizacion Editorial Mexicana|El Sol de México]] and he was asked about his views on the subject of '[[two Chinas]]' and if there is a solution for the sovereignty issues between the two. Ma replied that the relations are neither between two Chinas nor two states. It is a [[Special non-state-to-state relations|special relationship]]. Further, he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved at present, but he quoted the '[[1992 Consensus]]' as a temporary measure until a solution becomes available.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan and China in 'special relations': Ma |work=China Post |date=2008-09-04 |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan%20relations/2008/09/04/173082/Taiwan-and.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906092524/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan%20relations/2008/09/04/173082/Taiwan-and.htm |archive-date=2008-09-06 }}</ref> Former spokesman for the ROC Presidential Office [[Wang Yu-chi]] later elaborated the President's statement and said that the relations are between two regions of one country, based on the ROC Constitutional position, the Statute Governing the Relations Between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area and Mainland Area and the '1992 Consensus'.<ref>{{cite news|title=Presidential Office defends Ma |work=Taipei Times |date=2008-09-05 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/09/05/2003422339 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911200500/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/09/05/2003422339 |archive-date=2008-09-11 }}</ref> On 7 October 2008 Ma Ying-jeou was interviewed by a Japan-based magazine "World".

President [[Tsai Ing-wen]], in her first inauguration speech in 2016, acknowledged that the talks surrounding the [[1992 Consensus]] took place without agreeing that a consensus was reached.  She credited the talks with spurring 20 years of dialogue and exchange between the two sides.

In January 2019, [[Xi Jinping]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] wrote an open letter to Taiwan proposing a [[one country, two systems]] formula for eventual unification.

Semi-governmental contact is maintained through the [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF) and the [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] (ARATS). Negotiations between the SEF and the ARATS resumed on 11 June 2008.<ref name="CT080611">{{cite web |script-title=zh:兩會「跳級」復談 高孔廉VS.孫亞夫 |trans-title=SEF and ARATS "skip grades" in resuming negotiations; Gao Konglian vs Sun Yafu |work=China Times |date=11 June 2008 |url=http://news.chinatimes.com/2007Cti/2007Cti-Focus/2007Cti-Focus-Content/0,4518,9706110011+0+0+072123+0,00.html |language=zh |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203021016/http://news.chinatimes.com/2007Cti/2007Cti-Focus/2007Cti-Focus-Content/0%2C4518%2C9706110011%2B0%2B0%2B072123%2B0%2C00.html |archive-date=2013-12-03 |access-date=2008-06-11 }}</ref>

Although formally privately constituted bodies, the SEF and the ARATS are both directly led by the Executive Government of each side: the SEF by the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] of the [[Executive Yuan]] of the ROC, and the ARATS by the [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] of the PRC. The heads of the two bodies, [[Lin Join-sane]] and [[Chen Deming]], are both full-time appointees and do not hold other government positions. However, both are senior members of their respective political parties ([[Kuomintang]] and [[Communist Party of China]] respectively), and both have previously served as senior members of their respective governments. Their deputies, who in practice are responsible for the substantive negotiations, are concurrently senior members of their respective governments. For the June 2008 negotiations, the main negotiators, who are deputy heads of the SEF and the ARATS respectively, are concurrently deputy heads of the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] and the [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] respectively.{{Citation needed |date = May 2009}}

To date, the 'most official'{{Citation needed |date = December 2013}} representative offices between the two sides are the PRC's [[Cross-Strait Tourism Exchange Association]] (CSTEA) in Taiwan, established on 7 May 2010, and ROC's [[Taiwan Strait Tourism Association]] (TSTA) in China, established on 4 May 2010. However, the duties of these offices are limited only to tourism-related affairs so far.

=== 2008 meetings ===

==== First 2008 meeting ====
A series of meetings were held between the SEF and the ARATS at [[Diaoyutai State Guesthouse]] in [[Beijing]] from 11 June 2008 to 14 June 2008. By convention, SEF–ARATS negotiations proceed in three rounds: a technical round led by negotiators seconded from the relevant government departments, a draft round led by deputy heads of the two organisations, and a formal round led by the heads of the two organisations. In this case, however, both sides have already reached broad consensus on these issues on both the technical and political levels through previous negotiations via the non-governmental and inter-party channels. As a result, the initial technical round was dispensed with, and the negotiations began with the second, draft round.<ref name="CT080611"/>

The two sides agreed to the following:
[[File:Cross-strait charters weekends08.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Route Map of the weekend cross-strait charter, for flights as of August, 2008. (To make lines easy to distinguish, the actual path between cities is not shown accurately; planes to and from Taiwan had to fly through Hong Kong airspace at the time.)]]
* Initiate direct passenger airline services every weekend from 4 July 2008. Both parties agreed to negotiate on the routes of cross-strait direct flights and establish direct communication procedures concerning air traffic management systems as soon as possible. But before the routes of direct flights are finalized, charter flights may temporarily fly across [[Hong Kong Flight Information Region]].{{why|date=March 2020}} There is no need to stop in Hong Kong, but planes still have to fly through its airspace. Weekend charter flights shall fly from each Friday to the following Monday for a total of four full days.

::PRC agreed to open the following five cities as destinations: [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]] ([[Pudong]]), [[Guangzhou]], [[Xiamen]] and [[Nanjing]]. Mainland China shall open [[Chengdu]], [[Chongqing]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Dalian]], [[Guilin]], [[Shenzhen]] and other destinations later on and other cities if so demanded by the market.

::ROC agreed to open the following eight cities as destinations: [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]], [[Kaohsiung]] ([[Siaogang]]), [[Taichung]] (Chingchunkang), [[Taipei]] ([[Songshan District, Taipei|Sungshan]]), [[Penghu]] (Makung), [[Hualien City|Hualien]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Taitung City|Taitung]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sef.org.tw/english/index.html |title = Full Text of SEF-ARATS Minutes of Talks on Cross-Strait Charter Flights |publisher = Straits Exchange Foundation |date = 2006-06-13 |access-date = 2008-10-26 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090213231455/http://www.sef.org.tw/english/index.html |archive-date = 2009-02-13 |url-status = live }}</ref>

* Opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists. Both parties agreed that Mainland Chinese tourists must travel to Taiwan in groups. Tourists must enter into, visit, and exit from Taiwan in groups. The maximum quota of tourists received by the party responsible for tourist reception shall not exceed the average of 3,000 persons per day, and each group shall consist of a minimum of ten persons and forty persons at the maximum, being in Taiwan for a maximum of ten days.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sef.org.tw/english/index.html |title = Full Text of Cross-Strait Agreement Signed Between SEF and ARATS Concerning Mainland Tourists Traveling to Taiwan |publisher = Straits Exchange Foundation |date = 2006-06-13 |access-date = 2008-10-26 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090213231455/http://www.sef.org.tw/english/index.html |archive-date = 2009-02-13 |url-status = live }}</ref>
* However, in 2012, it was agreed by both parties that individual tourists from the PRC cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Xiamen were allowed to visit Taiwan. Later, tourists from Chengdu, Chongqing, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Tianjin were allowed to visit Taiwan individually. Finally, Fuzhou, Jinan, and Xi'an will join the list by the end of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=188682&ctNode=413 |title=Taiwan expands mainland Chinese tourism program |date=2 April 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914112933/http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=188682&ctNode=413 |archive-date=2013-09-14 }}</ref>

To facilitate the above, both sides also agreed to further discuss on the possibilities of exchanging representative offices, with an SEF office to be opened in [[Beijing]] and an ARATS office in [[Taipei]] to issue [[travel permit]]s to cross-Strait visitors, among other duties.

===Inter-party===
The [[Kuomintang]] (former ruling party of Taiwan) and the [[Communist Party of China]], maintain regular dialogue via the [[Cross-Strait Economic, Trade and Culture Forum|KMT–CPC Forum]]. This has been called a "second rail" in Taiwan, and helps to maintain political understanding and aims for political consensus between the two parties.

=== Inter-city ===
The [[Shanghai-Taipei City Forum]] is an annual forum between the city of [[Shanghai]] and [[Taipei]]. Launched in 2010 by then-[[Mayor of Taipei|Taipei Mayor]] [[Hau Lung-pin]] to promote city-to-city exchanges, it led Shanghai participation in the [[Taipei International Flora Exposition]] end of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan-relations/2015/08/18/443558/Ko-heads.htm |title=Ko heads to meeting in Shanghai |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818082250/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan-relations/2015/08/18/443558/Ko-heads.htm |archive-date=2015-08-18 }}</ref> Both Taipei and Shanghai are the first two cities across the Taiwan Strait that carries out exchanges.

=== Non-governmental ===
A third mode of contact is through private bodies accredited by the respective governments to negotiate on technical and operational aspects of issues between the two sides. Called the "[[Macau]] mode", this avenue of contact was maintained even through the years of the [[Chen Shui-bian]] administration. For example, on the issues of opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists, the accredited bodies were tourism industry representative bodies from both sides.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Comparing the semiconductor industry in China and Taiwan today, Taiwan is the leader in terms of overall competitiveness. On 6 August 2020, Wired, which is a monthly American magazine, published a report. In this report, it stated that “Taiwan has faced existential conflict with China for its entire existence and has been targeted by China's state-sponsored hackers for years. But an investigation by one Taiwanese security firm has revealed just how deeply a single group of Chinese hackers was able to penetrate an industry at the core of the Taiwanese economy, pillaging practically its entire semiconductor industry.”<ref>{{cite web |last1= Greenberg |first1= Andy |title= Chinese Hackers Have Pillaged Taiwan's Semiconductor Industry|url=http://www.mohrss.gov.cn/SYrlzyhshbzb/dongtaixinwen/buneiyaowen/201605/t20160530_240967.html |access-date=12 August 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200813041037/https://www.wired.com/story/chinese-hackers-taiwan-semiconductor-industry-skeleton-key/ | archive-date=12 August 2020}}</ref>

=== Cultural, educational, religious and sporting exchanges ===

The [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]] and the [[Palace Museum]] in [[Beijing]] have collaborated on exhibitions. Scholars and academics frequently visit institutions on the other side. Books published on each side are regularly re-published in the other side, though restrictions on direct imports and the [[Debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters|different writing systems]] between the two sides somewhat impede the exchange of books and ideas.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Students of [[Taiwan]] origin receive special concessions in the [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination]] in [[mainland China]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} There are regular programs for school students from each side to visit the other.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} In 2019, there are 30,000 mainland Chinese and Hong Kong students studying in Taiwan.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Chih-chung|last1=Chen|first2=Chih-wei|last2=Hsu|first3=Joseph|last3=Yeh|date=2 October 2019|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/acs/201910020009.aspx|title=Chinese students urged to cherish, respect freedom of speech|publisher=Focus Taiwan|accessdate=10 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003232303/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/acs/201910020009.aspx|archive-date=3 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> There are also more than 7,000 Taiwanese students currently studying in Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Pei-ju|last1=Teng|date=14 October 2019|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3795370|title=Taiwan to provide legal assistance to its students in Hong Kong|publisher=Taiwan News|accessdate=15 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015001741/https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3795370|archive-date=15 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Chinese football team [[Changchun Yatai F.C.]] chose [[Taiwan]] as the first stop of their 2015 winter training session, which is the first Chinese professional football team's arrival in Taiwan, and they were supposed to have an exhibition against [[Tatung F.C.]], which, however, wasn't successfully held, under unknown circumstances.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

=== Humanitarian actions ===
Both sides have provided humanitarian aid to each other on several occasions.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Following the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], an expert search and rescue team was sent from Taiwan to help rescue survivors in [[Sichuan]].
