'''Heidelberg University''', officially the '''Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg''', ({{lang-de|Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg}}; {{lang-la|Universitas Ruperto Carola Heidelbergensis}}) is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Heidelberg]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], Germany. Founded in 1386 on instruction of [[Pope Urban VI]], Heidelberg is [[List of universities in Germany#Universities by years of existence|Germany's oldest university]] and one of the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|world's oldest surviving universities]]. It was the third university established in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>Prague (1348) and Vienna (1365) were at that time also German-speaking universities, while Vienna still is. Irrespective of the shared language of instruction, Heidelberg is the oldest university in contemporary Germany.</ref>

Heidelberg has been a [[coeducational]] institution since 1899. The university consists of twelve [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] and offers degree programmes at [[undergraduate]], [[graduate education|graduate]] and [[habilitation|postdoctoral]] levels in some 100 disciplines.<ref>The university does not include departments of [[business administration|business]], [[visual arts]], and engineering, except for computer engineering.

==History==
{{main|History of Heidelberg University}}

===Founding===

[[File:Ruprecht I mit Frauen.jpg|thumb|In 1386, Heidelberg University was founded by [[Rupert I, Elector Palatine|Rupert I]] on instruction of [[Pope Urban VI]] who demanded modelling it after the ancient [[University of Paris]].]]

The [[Western Schism|Great Schism]] of 1378 made it possible for Heidelberg, a relatively small city and capital of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], to gain its own university.<ref name="Cser31">{{harvnb|Cser|2007|page=31}}</ref> The Great Schism was initiated by the election of two [[pope]]s after the death of [[Pope Gregory XI]] in the same year.<ref name="Cser31" /> One successor resided in [[Avignon]] (elected by the French) and the other in Rome (elected by the Italian cardinals).<ref name="Cser31" /> The German secular and spiritual leaders voiced their support for the successor in Rome, which had far-reaching consequences for the German students and teachers in Paris: they lost their stipends and had to leave.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolgast|1986|page=1–2}}</ref>

[[Rupert I, Elector Palatine of the Rhine|Rupert I]] recognized the opportunity and initiated talks with the [[Roman Curia|Curia]], which ultimately led to a [[Papal bull|Papal Bull]] for foundation of a university. After having received, on 23 October 1385, permission from pope [[Urban VI]] to create a school of general studies ({{lang-la|studium generale}}), the final decision to found the university was taken on 26 June 1386 at the behest of [[Rupert I, Elector Palatine of the Rhine|Rupert I]], [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]].<ref name="Wolgast3">{{harvnb|Wolgast|1986|page=3}}</ref> As specified in the papal charter, the university was modelled after [[University of Paris]] and included four faculties: [[philosophy]], [[theology]], [[jurisprudence]], and [[medicine]].<ref name="Hermans2005">{{cite book|title=Charters of Foundation and Early Documents of the Universities of the Coimbra Group|series=Varia Letteren| editor-first1=Jos.

On 18 October 1386 a special [[Pontifical High Mass]] in the ''[[Church of the Holy Spirit (Heidelberg)|Heiliggeistkirche]]'' was the ceremony that established the university.<ref name="Wolgast3"/> On 19 October 1386 the first lecture was held,<ref name="Wolgast3"/> making Heidelberg the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest university in Germany]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wolgast|1986|page=1}}</ref> In November 1386, [[Marsilius of Inghen]] was elected first [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university.<ref name="Cser39">{{harvnb|Cser|2007|page=39}}</ref> The rector seal motto was ''semper apertus''—i.e., "the book of learning is always open."<ref>{{harvnb|Wolgast|1986|page=5–6}}</ref> The university grew quickly and in March 1390, 185 students were enrolled at the university.<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|page=40}}</ref>

[[File:2013.10.01.111339 Alte Brücke Heiliggeistkirche View City Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|A [[Solemn Mass]] was offered in the ''[[Church of the Holy Spirit (Heidelberg)|Heiliggeistkirche]]'' in 1386 to mark and bless the establishment of the university.]]

===Late Middle Ages===
Between 1414 and 1418, theology and jurisprudence professors of the university took part in the [[Council of Constance]] and acted as counselors for [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Louis III]], who attended this council as representative of the emperor and chief magistrate of the realm. This resulted in establishing a good reputation for the university and its professors.<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|p=43}}</ref>

Due to the influence of Marsilius, the university initially taught the [[nominalism]] or ''via moderna''. In 1412, both realism and the teachings of [[John Wycliffe]] were forbidden at the university but later, around 1454, the university decided that [[Philosophical realism|realism]] or ''via antique'' would also be taught, thus introducing two parallel ways ({{lang|la|ambae viae}}).<ref name="Gabriel1974">{{harvnb|Gabriel|1974|pages = 459–61}}</ref>

The transition from [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] to [[humanistic]] culture was effected by the chancellor and bishop [[Johann von Dalberg]] in the late 15th century. Humanism was represented at Heidelberg University particularly by the founder of the older German Humanistic School [[Rudolph Agricola]], [[Conrad Celtes]], [[Jakob Wimpfeling]], and [[Johann Reuchlin]]. [[Pope Pius II|Æneas Silvius Piccolomini]] was chancellor of the university in his capacity of provost of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and later always favored it with his friendship and good-will as [[Pope Pius II]]. In 1482, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] permitted laymen and married men to be appointed professors in the ordinary of medicine through a papal dispensation. In 1553, [[Pope Julius III]] sanctioned the allotment of ecclesiastical benefice to secular professors.<ref name="catholic1">{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5611|title=Heidelberg University - Catholic Encyclopedia|access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Catholic Online}}</ref>

=== Reformation and modern era ===
[[Martin Luther]]'s [[Heidelberg Disputation|disputation at Heidelberg in April 1518]] made a lasting impact, and his adherents among the masters and scholars soon became leading [[Protestant Reformation|Reformationists]] in Southwest Germany. With the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] turn to the Reformed faith, [[Otto Henry, Elector Palatine]], converted the university into a [[calvinism|calvinistic]] institution. In 1563, the [[Heidelberg Catechism]] was created under collaboration of members of the university's divinity school.

As the 16th century was passing, the late [[humanism]] stepped beside [[Calvinism]] as a predominant school of thought; and figures like [[Paul Schede]], [[Jan Gruter]], [[Martin Opitz]], and [[Matthäus Merian]] taught at the university. It attracted [[scholar]]s from all over the continent and developed into a [[culture|cultural]] and [[academia|academic]] center.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{harvnb|Cser|2007|p={{Page needed|date=November 2010}}}}</ref> However, with the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1618, the intellectual and [[revenue|fiscal]] wealth of the university declined. In 1622, the then-world-famous [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] (the [[library]] of the university) was stolen from the [[Heiliggeistkirche|University Cathedral]] and taken to Rome. The reconstruction efforts thereafter were defeated by the troops of King [[Louis XIV]], who destroyed Heidelberg in 1693 almost completely.<ref name="histu">{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/university/welcome/history.html |title=History of the University |access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219133606/http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/university/welcome/history.html |archive-date=2007-12-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sino.uni-heidelberg.de/students/tjuelch/Bauwerke%20Altstadt/Peterskirche.htm|title=A history of the Church of St. Peter|access-date=2008-05-16|work=Heidelberg University Homepage|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102164028/http://www.sino.uni-heidelberg.de/students/tjuelch/Bauwerke%20Altstadt/Peterskirche.htm|archive-date=2008-01-02}}</ref>

As a consequence of the late [[Counter-Reformation]], the university lost its Protestant character, and was channeled by [[Jesuits]]. In 1735, the Old University was constructed at University Square, then known as Domus Wilhelmina. Through the efforts of the [[Jesuits]] a preparatory seminary was established, the Seminarium ad Carolum Borromæum, whose pupils were also registered in the university. After the suppression of the Jesuit Order, most of the schools they had conducted passed into the hands of the [[Lazarists|French Congregation of Lazarists]] in 1773. They deteriorated from that time forward, and the university itself continued to lose in prestige until the reign of the last elector [[Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine]], who established new chairs for all the faculties, founded scientific institutes such as the Electoral Academy of Science, and transferred the school of [[political economy]] from Kaiserslautern to Heidelberg, where it was combined with the university as the faculty of political economy. He also founded an [[observatory]] in the neighboring city of [[Mannheim]], where Jesuit [[Christian Mayer (astronomer)|Christian Mayer]] labored as director. In connection with the four hundredth anniversary of the university, the elector approved a revised statute book that several professors had been commissioned to prepare. The financial affairs of the university, its receipts and expenditures, were put in order. At that time, the number of students varied from 300 to 400; in the jubilee year, 133 matriculated. As a consequence of the disturbances caused by the [[French Revolution]], and particularly because of the [[Treaty of Lunéville]], the university lost all its property on the left bank of the [[Rhine]], so that its complete dissolution was expected.<ref name=catholic>{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=University of Heidelberg}}</ref>

===19th and early 20th century===

This decline did not stop until 1803, when the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by [[Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden]], to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted. Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of [[Rupert I, Elector Palatine of the Rhine|Ruprecht I]]. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade, [[Romanticism]] found expression in Heidelberg through [[Clemens Brentano]], [[Achim von Arnim]], [[Ludwig Tieck]], [[Joseph Görres]], and [[Joseph von Eichendorff]], and there went forth a revival of the German [[Middle Ages]] in speech, poetry, and art.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

[[File:Heidlbergaula.JPG|left|thumb|The Old Assembly Hall or "Great Hall" was redesigned in 1886 in celebration of the university's quincentenary.]]

The German [[Students Association]] exerted great influence, which was at first patriotic and later political. After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of [[Liberalism]] and the movement in favor of German national unity.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The historians [[Friedrich Christoph Schlosser]] and [[Georg Gottfried Gervinus]] were the guides of the nation in [[political history]]. The modern scientific schools of [[medicine]] and [[natural science]], particularly [[astronomy]], were models in point of construction and equipment, and Heidelberg University was especially noted for its influential law school.<ref name="catholic"/> The university as a whole became the role model for the transformation of American [[liberal arts college]]s into [[research universities]], in particular for the then-newly established [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref name=atlanticreview>{{cite web|url=http://atlanticreview.org/archives/448-When-German-Universities-Were-Models-for-American-Universities.html|title=When German Universities were Models for American Universities|access-date=2010-01-10|work=atlanticreview.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219185305/http://atlanticreview.org/archives/448-When-German-Universities-Were-Models-for-American-Universities.html|archive-date=2016-12-19|url-status=dead}}</ref> Heidelberg's professors were important supporters of the [[Vormärz]] revolution and many of them were members of the first freely elected German parliament, the [[Frankfurt Parliament|Frankfurt Parliament of 1848]]. During the late 19th century, the university housed a very liberal and open-minded spirit, which was deliberately fostered by [[Max Weber]], [[Ernst Troeltsch]] and a circle of colleagues around them.

In February 1900, the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] issued a decree that gave women the right to access universities in Baden. Thus, the universities of Freiburg and Heidelberg were the first ones to allow [[Women at German universities|women to study]].

In the [[Weimar Republic]], the university was widely recognized as a center of [[democracy|democratic]] thinking, coined by [[professor]]s like [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Gustav Radbruch]], [[Martin Dibelius]] and [[Alfred Weber]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: [[Nazism|Nazi]] physicist [[Philipp Lenard]] was head of the physical institute during that time. Following the assassination of the liberal German-Jewish [[Foreign Minister]] [[Walther Rathenau]], he refused to [[half mast]] the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by [[communist]] students.<ref name="histu"/>

===Nazi Germany===

With the advent of the [[Third Reich]] in 1933, the university supported [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi]]s  like all other German universities at the time. It dismissed a large number of staff and students for political and racial reasons. Many dissident fellows had to emigrate and most [[Jewish]] and [[Communist]] professors that did not leave Germany were deported. At least two professors directly fell victim to Nazi terror.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolgast|1986|p=146}}</ref> On 17 May 1933, members of the university faculty and students took part in [[book burning]]s at ''Universitätsplatz'' ("University Square")<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|p=278}}</ref> and Heidelberg eventually became infamous as a [[NSDAP]] university. The inscription above the main entrance of the New University was changed from "The Living Spirit" to "The German Spirit",<ref>{{harvnb|Cser|2007|p=256}}</ref> and many professors paid homage to the new motto. The university was involved in [[Nazi eugenics]]: forced sterilizations were carried out at the women's clinic and the psychiatric clinic, then directed by [[Carl Schneider]], was involved in [[Action T4]] [[Euthanasia]] program.<ref>{{harvnb|Remy|2002|pp=72–3, 107–10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medizinische-fakultaet-hd.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php?id=109869&L=en|title=History |work=Medizinische Fakultät Heidelberg}}</ref>

The heads of the university helped in the deportation of Jewish men, women and children directly to the gas chambers.

After the end of World War II, the university underwent an extensive [[denazification]].

===Federal Republic of Germany===
Since Heidelberg was spared from destruction during World War II, the reconstruction of the university was realized rather quickly. With the foundation of the Collegium Academicum, Heidelberg University became the home of Germany's first and, until today, only self-governed student hall. Newly laid statutes obliged the university to "The Living Spirit of Truth, Justice and Humanity".<ref name="histu"/>

During the 1960s and 1970s, the university grew dramatically in size. At this time, it developed into one of the main scenes of the left-wing [[student protests]] in Germany.<ref name="Ruprecht12.7.1995">{{cite web|url=http://mathphys.fsk.uni-heidelberg.de/ruprecht2.html |title=Student protests at Heidelberg |access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Ruprecht online - Heidelberg University Homepage |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215141632/http://mathphys.fsk.uni-heidelberg.de/ruprecht2.html |archive-date=2009-02-15 }} from ''Ruprecht'', issue 37, 12.07.95</ref> In 1975, a massive police force arrested the entire student parliament [[AStA]]. Shortly thereafter, the building of the Collegium Academicum, a progressive college in immediate vicinity to the university's main grounds, was stormed by over 700 police officers and closed once and for all. On the outskirts of the city, in the Neuenheimer Feld area, a large campus for [[medicine]] and [[natural sciences]] was constructed.<ref name="histu"/>

Today, about 28,000 students are enrolled for studies at Heidelberg University.<ref name="QS Profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university/heidelberguniversity/|title=QS - Heidelberg University statistics|access-date=2010-10-02|work=QS - Top Universities|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005014556/http://www.topuniversities.com/university/heidelberguniversity|archive-date=2010-10-05}}</ref> There are 4,196 full-time faculty, including 476 university professors.<ref name="Eitel1"/> In 2007, and again in 2012, the university was appointed ''[[German Excellence Universities|University of Excellence]]'' under an initiative started by the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] and the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]]. This enhanced the German university system by establishing a small network of exceptionally well-funded universities, which are expected to generate strong international appeal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/press/news/538e.html|title=Press Releases - Rector Prof. Eitel: "An invaluable opportunity to aim at goals that would otherwise have been unattainable." |access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage}}</ref>

Heidelberg is a city with approximately 140,000 inhabitants. It is situated in the [[Rhein-Neckar|Rhine Neckar Triangle]], a [[Largest European cities and metropolitan areas|European metropolitan area]] with approximately 2.4 million people living there, comprising the neighboring cities of [[Heidelberg]], [[Mannheim]], [[Ludwigshafen]], and a number of smaller towns in the perimeter. Heidelberg is known as the cradle of [[Romanticism]], and its old town and [[Heidelberg Castle|castle]] are among the most frequented tourist destinations in Germany. Its pedestrian zone is a shopping and night life magnet for the surrounding area and beyond.

Heidelberg University's facilities are, generally speaking, separated in two parts. The faculties and institutes of humanities and social sciences are embedded in the Old Town Campus. The sciences faculties and the medical school, including three large university hospitals, are located on the New Campus in the Neuenheimer Feld on the outskirts of Heidelberg.<ref name=map>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/univ/besucher/wege.html |title=Maps of Heidelberg University |access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607004818/http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/univ/besucher/wege.html |archive-date=2008-06-07 }}</ref>

===Old Town Campus===

[[File:2005 uni-03.jpg|thumb|left|The New University of 1931 as seen from the Old University.]]

The so-called New University is regarded as the center of the Old Town Campus. It is situated at the ''Universitätsplatz'' (University Square) in the pedestrian zone, in direct vicinity to the University Library and to the main administration buildings. The New University was officially opened in 1931. Its erection was largely financed by donations of wealthy American families, in line with a fundraising campaign of [[Jacob Gould Schurman]], an alumnus of Heidelberg University and former [[United States Ambassador to Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news/2005schurman2.html|title=7.

Education in humanities and social sciences takes place to a great extent in buildings spread over the ancient part of town, though most are less than ten minutes walk from University Square. The faculties maintain their own extensive libraries and work spaces for students. Seminars and tutorials are usually held in the faculty buildings.<ref name="map"/>

===Neuenheimer Feld – New Campus===
{{Main|New Campus (Heidelberg University)}}

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Neuenheimer Feld.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial perspective on the New Campus in the Neuenheimer Feld.]] -->

In the 1960s the university started building a new campus near the city district Neuenheim, called the Neuenheimer Feld. It is today the largest part of the university, and the largest campus for natural sciences and life science in Germany.<ref name="Eitel1" /> Almost all science faculties and institutes, the medical school, [[University Hospital Heidelberg]], and the science branch of the University Library are situated on the New Campus. Most of the dormitories and the athletic facilities of the university can be found there as well.

Several independent research institutes, such as the [[German Cancer Research Center]] and two of the [[Max Planck Society|Max-Planck-Institutes]] have settled there. The New Campus is also the seat of several biomedical spin-off companies. The old part of town can be reached by [[tram]] and bus in about 10&nbsp;minutes. The Neuenheimer Feld campus has extensive parking lots for faculty and student vehicles for long term and short term parking, as well as visitors and patients of the various university hospitals. The Faculty of Physics and Astronomy is not located on either campus, but on the [[Heidelberg#Philosophers' Walk|Philosophers' Walk]], separated from the Old Town by the River Neckar, and some {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the New Campus. It also maintains observatory facilities on the [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl Mountain]].<ref name="map" />

The university maintains [[Botanical Garden of the University of Heidelberg|a botanical garden]] at Neuenheimer Feld.<ref name="BCGI">{{cite web |title=Botanischer Garten der Universität Heidelberg |url=http://www.bgci.org/garden.php?id=101&ftrCountry=DE&ftrKeyword=&ftrBGCImem=&ftrIAReg= |website=www.bgci.org |access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>

===Bergheim Campus===

[[File:Heidelberg Haupteingang Ludolf-Krehl-Klink.JPG|thumb|The Bergheim Campus houses Economics and the Social Sciences.]]

The Bergheim Campus is located in the former Ludolf Krehl clinic (named after [[Ludolf von Krehl]]) in the inner-city suburb of [[Heidelberg-Bergheim]]. Since March 2009 it has housed the institutes economics, political science, and sociology (together the Heidelberg University Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences) that formerly resided at the Old Town campus. The Bergheim campus offers one lecture theatre, several seminar rooms, the most modern of the university libraries, and a cafe (rather than the full cafeteria present in the other campuses).

===Libraries===
{{main|University Library Heidelberg}}
[[File:Heidelberg Universitätsbibliothek 2003.jpg|left|thumb|The main building of the University Library, built in 1905.]]

The University Library is the main library of the university, and constitutes together with the decentralized libraries of the faculties and institutes, the integral university library system comprising approximately 6.7 million printed books. It is Germany's most frequently used library, and it is currently placed 1st in a ranking of Germany's best libraries.<ref name=ubrank>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news2010/pm20100630_bibliotheksindex.html|title=Library ranking - Heidelberg finishes first|access-date=2010-09-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage}}</ref> The University Library's stocks exceeded one million in 1934. Today, it holds about 3.2 million books, about 500,000 other media such as microfilms and video tapes, as well as 10,732 scientific periodicals. Moreover, it holds 6,600 [[manuscripts]], most notably the [[Codex Manesse]], 1,800 [[incunabula]], 110,500 [[autographs]], and a collection of old maps, paintings, and photographs. The further 83 decentralized libraries of the faculties and institutes hold another 3.5 million printed books. In 2005, 34,500 active users of the University Library accessed 1.4 million books a year. The conventional book supply is complemented by numerous electronic services. Around 3,000 commercial scientific journals can be accessed via [[e-journal]].<ref name=ub>{{cite web |url=http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/allg/profil/geschichte.html|title=Geschichte der Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg|access-date=2008-05-16 |work=University Library of Heidelberg Homepage}}</ref> The University Library of today traces its roots back to the purchase of a chest of documents by the first Rector [[Marsilius of Inghen|Marsilius von Inghen]] in 1388, which was stored in the [[Heiliggeistkirche]], then the University Cathedral. Since 1978, the science branch of the University Library serves the institutes of natural sciences and medicine on the New Campus.<ref name="ub"/> In 2016, extensive refurbishments were finalized with the University Library now housing additional study spaces.

===Facilities abroad===
Heidelberg University founded a [[:es:Heidelberg Center para América Latina|Center for Latin America]] in [[Santiago, Chile]] in 2001.<ref name=center>{{cite web |url=http://www.heidelberg-center.uni-hd.de/english/center.html|title=The Center|access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg Center for Latin America Homepage}}</ref> It has the task of organizing, managing, and marketing the courses of study maintained either independently by Heidelberg University or in cooperation with the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] and the [[University of Chile]]. The center has responsibility for programs of [[postgraduate education]]. It also coordinates the activities of Heidelberg University in Latin America, and provides a platform for scientific cooperation.<ref name="center"/>

The university is also represented by a liaison office in New York. Its main tasks include promoting existing collaborations, building up new networks, creating joint study programs, and maintaining and expanding academic contacts with American universities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magazine-deutschland.de/en/artikel-en/article/article/die-uni-heidelberg-in-new-york.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120804090224/http://www.magazine-deutschland.de/en/artikel-en/article/article/die-uni-heidelberg-in-new-york.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-08-04|title=Heidelberg University in New York|access-date=2008-05-16|work=Deutschland Magazin.de}}</ref> In addition, the [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Philosophy and History#South Asia Institute (SAI)|Heidelberg South Asia Institute]] maintains branch offices in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]; [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]]; [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]; [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]]; and [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/en/associated_chairs.php|title=Heidelberg South Asia Institute|access-date=2012-05-28 |work=Heidelberg University website}}</ref>

==Organization==

===Governance===
The [[Rector (academia)|Rectorate]] is the '[[executive (government)|executive body]]' of the university, headed by rector [[Bernhard Eitel]]. The rectorate consists of the [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]], [[:de:Holger Schroeter|Holger Schroeter]], who is the head of the central administration and responsible for the university's budgeting, and three pro-rectors, who are responsible for international relations, teaching and communication, and research and structure respectively.

The [[Senate]] is the '[[legislative branch]]' of the university. The rector and the members of the rectorate are senators ''[[ex officio]]'', as are also the [[Dean (education)|deans]] of the faculties, as well as the medical and managing directors of the [[University Hospital Heidelberg|University Hospital]], and the university's [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities officer]]. Another 20 senators are elected for four-year terms, within the following quotas: eight university professors; four academic staff; four delegates of the [[student body]]; and four employees of the university administration.

The [[University Council]] is the advisory board to the aforementioned entities and encompasses, among others, the former [[Israel]]i [[Ambassador]] to Germany [[Avi Primor]], as well as [[CEO]]s of German industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/einrichtungen/organe/index.html|title=Universitätsorgane und Funktionsträger|access-date=2008-05-16|work=Heidelberg University Homepage|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420081519/http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/einrichtungen/organe/index.html|archive-date=2008-04-20}}</ref>

===Faculties===
After a 2003 structural reformation, the university consists of 12 [[Faculty (division)|faculties]], which in turn comprise several disciplines, departments, and institutes. As a consequence of the [[Bologna process]], most faculties now offer [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]], [[Master's degree|Master's]], and [[Doctorate|Ph.D.]] degrees to comply with the new European degree standard. Notable exceptions are the undergraduate programs in [[law]], [[medicine]], [[dentistry]] and [[pharmacy]], from which students still graduate with the [[State Examination]], a central examination at Master's level held by the State of Baden-Württemberg.

===Organisation and length of courses===
The academic year is divided into two [[semester]]s. The winter semester runs from 1 October to 31 March and the summer semester from 1 April to 30 September. Classes are held from mid-October to mid-February and mid-April to mid-July. Students can generally begin their studies either in the winter or the summer semester. However, there are several subjects students can begin only in the winter semester. The standard time required to finish a [[Bachelor's degree]] is principally six semesters, and a further four semesters for consecutive [[Master's degrees]]. The normal duration of [[Ph.D.]] programmes for full-time students is 6 semesters. The overall period of study for an undergraduate degree is divided into two parts: a period of basic study, lasting at least four semesters, at the end of which students must sit a formal [[Test (assessment)|examination]], and a period of advanced study, lasting at least two semesters, after which students take their final examinations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/courses/prospective/admission_int/application_international.html |title=Application and Matriculation for International Students|access-date=2010-09-26 |publisher=Heidelberg University}}</ref>

===Admission===
In the winter-semester 2006/2007, the university offered 3,926 places in undergraduate programs restricted by [[numerus clausus]], with an overall acceptance rate of 16.3%.<ref name=press1>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news06/2608stud.html|title=Universität Heidelberg – Pressemitteilungen 1|access-date=2008-05-16|work=Heidelberg University Homepage|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701070649/http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news06/2608stud.html|archive-date=2007-07-01}}</ref> Most selective are the undergraduate programs in clinical medicine, molecular biotechnology, political science, and law, with acceptance rates of 3.6%,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zvs.de/Service/Download/Bew_Medizin_WS2006.pdf|title=Angebot- und Nachfrage nach Studienplätzen in bundesweit zulassungsbeschränkten Studiengängen zum Wintersemester 2006/2007 - Studiengang Medizin|access-date=2008-05-16 |work=ZVS Homepage |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080408213549/http://www.zvs.de/Service/Download/Bew_Medizin_WS2006.pdf  |archive-date = 2008-04-08}}</ref> 3.8%,<ref name="press1"/> 7.6%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rzuser.uni-hd.de/~it5/presse/news04/ausw.html|title=Universität Heidelberg – Pressemitteilungen 2|access-date=2008-05-16|work=Heidelberg University Homepage}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and 9.1%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rzuser.uni-hd.de/~it5/presse/news04/2409ausw.html|title=Universität Heidelberg – Pressemitteilungen 3|access-date=2008-05-16|work=Heidelberg University Homepage|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719103555/http://www.rzuser.uni-hd.de/~it5/presse/news04/2409ausw.html|archive-date=2011-07-19}}</ref> respectively. The selection is exercised by allocating the best qualified applicants to a given number of places available in the respective discipline, thus depending primarily on the chosen subjects and the grade point average of the [[Abitur]] or its equivalent. For some majors and minors in humanities—particularly for conceptually non-vocational like classics and ancient history—unrestricted admission is granted under certain criteria (e.g., relevant language proficiency), as applications regularly do not exceed the number of places available.

[[File:Codex Manesse 271r Von Buchheim.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The University Library's collection includes the [[Codex Manesse]], an important German song manuscript of the Middle Ages.]]

For prospective international undergraduate students, a language test for German—such as the [[Deutsche Sprachprüfung für den Hochschulzugang|DSH]]—is required. Admission to consecutive Master's programs always requires at least an undergraduate degree equivalent to the German grade "good" (i.e., normally B+ in American, or 2:1 in British terms). Except for the Master's programs taught in English, a language test for German must be passed as well. Ph.D. admission prerequisite is normally a strong Master's-level degree, but specific admission procedures vary and cannot be generalized.<ref>See the pages of the respective grad schools listed above for detailed information or start with [http://graduateacademy.uni-heidelberg.de/ Heidelberg Graduate Academy]</ref> International applicants usually make up considerably more than 20% of the applicant pool and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective country of origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/press/news/press321_e.html|title=Heidelberg University - Press Releases|access-date=2008-05-16|work=Heidelberg University Homepage|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192058/http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/press/news/press321_e.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Finances===
The German state heavily subsidizes university study to keep higher education affordable regardless of socio-economic background.<ref>As a benchmark: The state must pay approximately €33,000 (=$48,500) per year for each medical student.

From 2007 to 2012, Heidelberg has charged tuition fees of approximately €1,200 p.a. for undergraduate, consecutive Master's, and doctoral programs, for both [[European Union|EU]] and non-EU citizens, and for any subject area. However, from spring term 2012 onwards, tuition fees have been abolished.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mwk.baden-wuerttemberg.de/studiengebuehren/|title=''Studiengebühren'' (Tuition)|access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Baden Württemberg Ministry for Education and Research website}}</ref> The usual housing costs for on-campus dormitories range from €2,200 to €3,000 p.a.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zuv.uni-heidelbereng.de/AAA/erasmus//info_erasmus_incoming_ankunft_wohn.htm/|title=Information for incoming Erasmus Students|access-date=2008-05-16|work=Heidelberg University Homepage}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In the fiscal year 2005, Heidelberg University had an overall [[operating budget]] of approximately €856&nbsp;M, consisting of approximately €413&nbsp;M government funds, approximately €311&nbsp;M basic budget, and approximately €132&nbsp;M from external grants. The university spent approximately €529&nbsp;M in payroll costs and approximately €326&nbsp;M in other expenditures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www-ec.destatis.de/csp/shop/sfg/bpm.html.cms.cBroker.cls?cmspath=struktur,vollanzeige.csp&ID=1020857|archive-url=https://archive.today/20110812210956/https://www-ec.destatis.de/csp/shop/sfg/bpm.html.cms.cBroker.cls?cmspath=struktur,vollanzeige.csp&ID=1020857|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-08-12|title=Desastis - Statistiken und Kennzahlen zur Hochschulfinanzierung|access-date=2008-05-16|work=Statistisches Bundesamt Homepage}}</ref> Additionally, the university receives another €150&nbsp;M in research grants, distributed over 5 years from 2012 onwards, due to the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]]. In the fiscal year 2007, the university for the first time raised approximately €19&nbsp;M through tuition fees, exclusively to further improve the conditions of study. Only approximately €9.5&nbsp;M of these were spent at the end of the year and the rectorate had to urge the faculties to make use of their additional means.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suedwest-aktiv.de/landundwelt/suedwestumschau/3462341/artikel.php|title=Fachbereiche horten Millionen|access-date=2008-05-16 |format=php|work=Südwestumschau online}}</ref>

Today, the university puts an emphasis on natural sciences and medicine, but it retains its traditions with highly ranked faculties of humanities and social sciences. The ''Marsilius Kolleg'', named after [[Marsilius of Inghen]], was established in 2007 as a Center for Advanced Study to promote interdisciplinary dialogue and research especially between the sciences and the humanities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marsilius-kolleg.uni-heidelberg.de/index_en.html|title=Marsilius Kolleg|access-date=2008-05-16|work=Marsilius Kolleg Homepage|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323031942/http://www.marsilius-kolleg.uni-heidelberg.de/index_en.html|archive-date=2009-03-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other institutes such as the ''[[Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing]]'', the ''Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences'', the ''[[Heidelberg Center for American Studies]]'', and the ''[[Heidelberg University Faculty of Philosophy and History|South Asia Institute]]'' also build a bridge between faculties and thus emphasize the concept of a comprehensive university.

===International cooperations===
Heidelberg is a founding member of the [[League of European Research Universities]], the [[Coimbra Group]], and the [[European University Association]]. The university forms part of the German-Japanese University Consortium HeKKSaGOn, and it participates in 7 European exchange schemes for researchers and students, such as [[ERASMUS programme|ERASMUS]]. Furthermore, it is actively involved in the development of the German-speaking [[Andrássy Gyula German Language University of Budapest|Andrássy University of Budapest]], and co-runs the school of German law at the [[Jagiellonian University|Jagiellonian University of Kraków]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/international/|title=International cooperations|access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage}}</ref> The city of Heidelberg being twinned with [[Cambridge|Cambridge, England]], and [[Montpellier|Montpellier, France]], there are close academic ties to the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[Université de Montpellier]]. Beyond Europe, the university and its faculties maintain specific agreements with 58 partner universities in Africa, the [[Americas]], Asia, Australia and the [[Russian Federation]].

==Student life==

===Sports===

[[File:Ausblick vom 366 km langen Neckartalradweg, Neckar in Heidelberg - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Students rowing on the [[Neckar|Neckar river]].]]

The university offers a broad variety of athletics, such as teams in 16 different court sports from [[American football]] to [[volleyball]], courses in 11 different [[martial arts]], 26 courses in [[physical fitness]] and [[body building]], 9 courses in health sports from aquapower to [[yoga]], and groups in 12 different dance styles. Moreover, [[equestrian sports]], [[sailing]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[skiing]] in the French alps, [[track and field]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[fencing]], [[cycling]], [[acrobatics]], [[gymnastics]], and much more. Most of the sports are free of charge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.issw.uni-heidelberg.de/hsp/|title=Hochschulsport der Universität Heidelberg|access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Heidelberg University Homepage}}</ref> Heidelberg's competition teams are particularly successful in soccer, volleyball, equestrian sports, judo, karate, track and field, and basketball. The University Sports Club men's basketball team, [[USC Heidelberg]], is the championship record holder, won 13 national championships, and is the only university team playing at a professional level in the [[Pro A (basketball)|second division of Germany's national league]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc-heidelberg.de/|title=USC Heidelberg|access-date=2008-05-16|work=University Sports Club Heidelberg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502060051/http://www.usc-heidelberg.de/|archive-date=2010-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Groups===
Moreover, the university supports a number of student groups in various fields of interest. Among them are four drama clubs, the university orchestra [[Collegium Musicum]], four choirs, six student media groups, six groups of international students, nine groups of political parties and NGO's, several departments of European organizations of students in certain disciplines, four clubs dedicated to fostering international relations and cultural exchange, a chess club, a literature club, two debate societies (one focused on English debating, the other focused on German debating), one student consulting group, and four religious student groups. Student unions structure themselves as "Studierendenrat" (Student body council) as well as on department level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zuv.uni-heidelberg.de/international/erasmus/incoming/angebote_en.html|title=Erasmus - Incoming students - Student Life|access-date=2010-10-02|work=Heidelberg University|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006003152/http://www.zuv.uni-heidelberg.de/international/erasmus/incoming/angebote_en.html|archive-date=2010-10-06}}</ref>

===Media===
Heidelberg's student newspaper "''ruprecht''" is—with editions of more than 10,000 copies—one of Germany's largest student-run newspapers. It was recently distinguished by the [[MLP AG|MLP]] Pro Campus Press Award as Germany's best student newspaper. The jury of journalists from major newspapers commended its "well balanced, though critical attitude" and its "simply great" layout that "suffices highest professional demands." The ruprecht is financed entirely by advertising revenues, thus retaining independence from university management. Some renowned journalists emerged from ''ruprecht''{{'}}s editorial board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ruprecht.de/fileadmin/pdf/Presseberichte/2007_10_07_RNZ.pdf |title=Der "ruprecht" ist Deutschlands beste Studentenzeitung |access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Rhein Neckar Zeitung online |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530022839/http://www.ruprecht.de/fileadmin/pdf/Presseberichte/2007_10_07_RNZ.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-30 }}</ref>

However, the critical online student newspaper ''UNiMUT'', which is run by the joint student council of the faculties, criticized the ''ruprecht'' often for being conformed, and exceedingly layout-oriented.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://texte.ruprecht.de/zeigartikel.php?id=1437 |title=UniMUT – Der Kampf geht weiter! |access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Ruprecht online}}</ref>

Heidelberg is also home of Germany's oldest student [[law review]] ''[[Heidelberg Law Review]]''. The journal is published quarterly, at the beginning and end of each semester break, and is circulated throughout all of Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.studzr.de/html/menu_oben/uberuns_en.html |title=StudZR - About us |access-date=2008-05-16 |work=StudZR Homepage |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224133537/http://www.studzr.de/html/menu_oben/uberuns_en.html |archive-date=2008-02-24}}</ref>

===Studentenverbindung===
Heidelberg hosts 34 student [[Studentenverbindung|corporations]], which were largely founded in the 19th century. Corporations are to some extent comparable to the [[fraternities]] in the US. As traditional symbols ([[couleur]]) corporation members wear colored caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (''Kommers'') and some still practice the traditional [[academic fencing]], a kind of duel, to "shape their members for the challenges of life." In the 19th and early 20th century, corporations played an important role in Germany's student life. Today, however, corporations include only a relatively small number of students. Their self-declared mission is to keep academic traditions alive and to create friendships for life. The corporations' often representative 19th-century mansions are present throughout the Old Town.

===Nightlife===
[[Heidelberg]] is not least famous for its student night life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rhein-neckar-guide.de/heidelberg.html |title=Heidelberg night life |access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Rhein-Neckar guide |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709045120/http://www.rhein-neckar-guide.de/heidelberg.html |archive-date=2008-07-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Besides the various parties regularly organized by the student councils of the faculties, the semester opening and closing parties of the university, the dormitory parties, and the soirées of Heidelberg's 34 student fraternities, the city, and the [[Rhine Neckar Area|metropolitan area]] even more, offers night life for any taste and budget. Adjacent to University Square is Heidelberg's major night life district, where one pub is placed next to each other. From Thursday on, it is all night very crowded and full of atmosphere. Moreover, Heidelberg has five major discos. The largest of them is located at the New Campus. The city of [[Mannheim]], which is about twice as large as Heidelberg, is a 15-minute train ride away, and offers an even more diverse night life, having a broad variety of clubs and bars well-frequented by both Heidelberg's and Mannheim's student community.

==In fiction and popular culture==

=== Literature ===
In 1880 [[Mark Twain]] humorously detailed his impressions of Heidelberg's student life in ''[[A Tramp Abroad]]''. He painted a picture of the university as a school for aristocrats, where students pursued a dandy's lifestyle, and described the great influence the student corporations exerted on the whole of Heidelberg's student life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/119/119-h/119-h.htm|title=A Tramp Abroad, By Mark Twain, Complete|access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Project Gutenberg}}</ref>

In [[William Somerset Maugham]]'s 1915 masterpiece novel ''[[Of Human Bondage]]'', he described the one-year stay of the protagonist Philip Carey at Heidelberg University, in a largely autobiographical way. Heidelberg also featured in the respective film versions of the novel, released in [[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|1934]] (starring [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as Philip, and [[Bette Davis]] as Mildred), [[Of Human Bondage (1946 film)|1946]] (with [[Paul Henreid]] and [[Eleanor Parker]] in the lead roles), and [[Of Human Bondage (1964 film)|1964]] (with [[Laurence Harvey]] and [[Kim Novak]] in the lead roles).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/351|title=Of Human Bondage, By William Somerset Maugham, Complete|access-date=2009-02-10 |work=[[Project Gutenberg]]}}</ref>

E. C. Gordon, the hero of [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1964 novel ''[[Glory Road]]'', mentions his desire for a degree from Heidelberg and the dueling scars to go with it.

In [[Bernhard Schlink]]'s semi-autobiographical 1995 novel ''[[The Reader]]'', Heidelberg University is one of the main scenes of Part II. Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, Michael Berg, a law student at the university, re-encounters his former lover as she defends herself in a war-crimes trial, which he observes as part of a seminar.

=== Film and television ===
The 1927 silent film ''[[The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg]]'', based on [[Wilhelm Meyer-Förster]]'s play ''Alt Heidelberg'' (1903), starring [[Ramón Novarro]] and [[Norma Shearer]], continued Mark Twain's image of Heidelberg, showing the story of a German prince who comes to Heidelberg to study there, but falls in love with his innkeeper's daughter. Having been very popular in the first half of the 20th century, it presents the typical student life of the 19th and early 20th century, and it is today considered a masterpiece of the late silent film era.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018451/|title=The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg (1927)|access-date=2008-05-16 |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref> [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s 1954 color remake [[The Student Prince (film)|''The Student Prince'']], featuring the voice of [[Mario Lanza]], is based on [[Sigmund Romberg]]'s [[The Student Prince|operetta version of the story]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musicaltheatreguide.com/composers/romberg/student_prince.htm|title=The Student Prince|access-date=2008-05-16 |work=Musical & Theatre Guide}}</ref>
