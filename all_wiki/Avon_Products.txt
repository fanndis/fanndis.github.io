==History==
[[File:David_H._McConnell.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Founder David McConnell pictured in 1905]]
Avon's founder, [[David H. McConnell]], initially sold books as a door-to-door salesman to New York homes. In September 1886, he decided to sell perfumes rather than books.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2006-09-10-avon-strategy_x.htm|title=Avon updates its look, strategy|work= [[USA Today|USATODAY.com]]|date=2006-09-10|access-date=2016-03-29}}</ref> He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892. His business partner suggested calling it the "California Perfume Company." His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.<ref name="Oak">{{cite web

These methods include ''[[in vitro]]'' testing, [[computer simulation]]s, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.<ref name=":0" />

Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.<ref name=":0" /> Despite laws that require animal testing in some countries, Avon chooses to distribute its products in those jurisdictions. Laws in various countries require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell certain products in that country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.peta.org/action/action-alerts/avon-tests-on-animals/|title=Urge Avon to Stop Paying for Cruel Tests on Animals in China|work=PETA|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-US}}</ref> Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.peta.org/action/action-alerts/avon-mary-kay-estee-lauder-and-revlon-are-paying-for-tests-on-animals/|title=Avon, Mary Kay, Estée Lauder (and Subsidiary MAC Cosmetics), and Revlon Are Paying for Tests on Animals|work=PETA|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/living/beauty/search-cruelty-free-companies-products/|title=Search for Cruelty-Free Companies, Products, and More|date=2010-06-09|website=PETA|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref>

In 2019, Avon ended all regulatory-required animal testing, making it the first global beauty company selling in China to stop all animal testing of ingredients and products across all its brands by developing new ways to deliver products that do not require animal testing, such as reformulating products.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avonworldwide.com/about-us/our-values/policies-positions/animal-welfare|title=Animal Welfare position {{!}} Avon|website=Avon Worldwide|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> PETA has since announced that it has added Avon Products Inc. to their list of companies “Working for Regulatory Change.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avonworldwide.com/news/peta-recognizes-avons-change|title=PETA Recognizes Avon's Commitment to "Working for Regulatory Change"|website=Avon Worldwide|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>

In October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in [[France]] at the end of that month. Its French employees accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the company's publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24522756|title=Avon to close its French operations|work=BBC News|date=14 October 2013|access-date=14 October 2013}}</ref> As of January 2014, Avon France was in [[receivership]].<ref name="Avon France Said Seeking Receivership">{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/financial/avon-france-asks-to-enter-receivership-7398860?src=nl/mornReport/20140129 | title=Avon France Said Seeking Receivership | publisher=WWD | date=28 January 2014 | access-date=29 January 2014 | author=Weil, Jennifer}}</ref>
