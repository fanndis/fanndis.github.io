The '''Reformist Movement''' ({{lang-fr|Mouvement Réformateur}}, MR) is a [[liberalism in Belgium|liberal]]<ref name="Nordsieck"/><ref name="almeida"/><ref name="HayMenon2007">{{cite book|author1=Colin Hay|author2=Anand Menon|title=European Politics|url=https://archive.org/details/europeanpolitics00hayc|url-access=registration|date=18 January 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-928428-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/europeanpolitics00hayc/page/92 92]}}</ref> [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking]] [[Political parties in Belgium|political party in Belgium]]. The party is in coalition as part of the [[Michel I Government|Michel Government]] then [[Wilmès Government]] since October 2014, having provided two prime ministers since. After the [[2007 Belgian general election|2007 general election]] the MR was the largest [[Francophone]] political formation in Belgium, a position that was regained by the [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Socialist Party]] in the [[2010 Belgian general election|2010 general election]].

The MR is an alliance between three French-speaking and one German-speaking liberal parties. The [[Liberal Reformist Party (Belgium)|Liberal Reformist Party]] (PRL) and the [[Fédéralistes Démocrates Francophones|Francophone Democratic Federalists]] (FDF) started the alliance in 1993, and were joined in 1998 by the [[Mouvement des Citoyens pour le Changement|Citizens' Movement for Change]] (MCC). The alliance was then known as the PRL-FDF-MCC federation. The alliance became the MR during a congress in 2002, where the German-speaking liberal party, the [[Partei für Freiheit und Fortschritt|Party for Freedom and Progress]] joined as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mr.be/PDF/Statuts-MR.pdf|title=Le Mouvement Réformateur: Statuts|publisher=The Reformist Movement|accessdate=2007-07-08|language=French|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025708/http://www.mr.be/PDF/Statuts-MR.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-28}}</ref> The label PRL is no longer used, and the three other parties still use their own names. The MR is member of [[Liberal International]] and the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE) Party. However, on 25 September 2011, the FDF decided to leave the coalition. They did not agree with the manner in which president [[Charles Michel (Belgian politician)|Charles Michel]] defended the rights of the French-speaking people in the agreement concerning the splitting of the [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] district, during the [[2010–11 Belgian government formation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deredactie.be/permalink/1.1119060|title=FDF almost unanimously votes in favour of split with MR|publisher=deredactie.be|accessdate=2011-09-25|language=Dutch}}</ref>

Although the MR's original ideology emphasised [[classical liberalism]] and [[free market]] economics, it has of late joined the general trend of Belgian liberals to accept elements of [[social liberalism]] under the influence of [[Dirk Verhofstadt]], whose brother [[Guy Verhofstadt]] led the MR's Flemish counterpart, the [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Open VLD]].<ref name="Almeida2012">{{cite book|author=Dimitri Almeida|title=The Impact of European Integration on Political Parties: Beyond the Permissive Consensus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGzZ0MpDjtsC&pg=PA107|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-69374-5|page=107}}</ref>
