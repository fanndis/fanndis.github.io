==Parliamentary career==
Joining the Labour Party in 1945, Richardson began her political career as [[Ian Mikardo]]'s secretary. She co-ordinated the '[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left Group]]' and went on to become the secretary of the [[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune Group]] before co-ordinating the Victory for Socialism Campaign. In 1951 Richardson was elected to Hornsey Borough Council and became Mikardo's full-time secretary and working partner in his business which involved trade with eastern Europe. She contested the parliamentary seats of [[Monmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth]] in [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]] and [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955]], [[Hornchurch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornchurch]] in [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]], and [[Harrow East (UK Parliament constituency)|Harrow East]] in [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]].

She was seen as a peace campaigner on the [[hard left]] of the Labour Party. She was a member of the [[Socialist Campaign Group]] but resigned in 1988 in protest at [[Tony Benn]]'s decision to challenge [[Neil Kinnock]] for the leadership. She also served as a member of the [[Shadow Cabinet]]. She was a central figure of the feminist left and helped to expand women's rights in Britain and was the head of a group of women MPs that supported the anti-pornography position.<ref>Wilson, E., 'Feminist Fundamentalism: The shifting politics of sex and censorship' in Segal, L. And McIntosh, M. (1992) 'Sex Exposed:Sexuality and the Pornography Debate', Virago</ref> She was also a pro-choice campaigner.

Richardson also served as an executive member of the [[Liberty (pressure group)|National Council for Civil Liberties]], during a time in which the [[Paedophile Information Exchange]] (PIE), a [[Pro-pedophile activism|pro-paedophile activist]] group, was affiliated with NCCL. Richardson wrote to PIE journal ''Childhood Rights'', saying that she supported their campaign against [[corporal punishment]].<ref name="Ke-Times-22Jul14">{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Dominic|title=How paedophiles gained access to establishment by work with the young|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/reduk/article4155032.ece|work=The Times|date=22 July 2014|url-access=subscription }}</ref>
