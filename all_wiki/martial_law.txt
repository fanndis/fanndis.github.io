'''Martial law''' is the imposition of direct military control of normal civil functions or suspension of civil law by a government, especially in response to a temporary emergency where civil forces are overwhelmed, or in an [[military occupation|occupied]] territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/martial_law|title=Martial Law|last=Anonymous|date=19 August 2010|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law|title=Martial law|publisher=britannica.com}}</ref>
==Use==
Martial law can be used by governments to enforce their rule over the public, as seen in multiple countries listed below. Such incidents may occur after a [[coup d'état]] ([[2006 Thai coup d'état|Thailand in 2006]] and [[2014 Thai coup d'état|2014]], and [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|Egypt in 2013]]); when threatened by popular protest (China, [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]); to suppress political opposition ([[Martial law in Poland|martial law in Poland in 1981]]); or to stabilize insurrections or perceived insurrections (Canada, the [[October Crisis]] of 1970). Martial law may be declared in cases of major natural disasters; however, most countries use a different legal construct, such as a [[state of emergency]].

Martial law has also been imposed during conflicts, and in cases of occupations, where the absence of any other civil government provides for an unstable population. Examples of this form of military rule include post [[World War II]] reconstruction in Germany and Japan, the recovery and reconstruction of the former [[Confederate States of America]] during [[Reconstruction Era]] in the United States of America following the [[American Civil War]], and German occupation of northern France between 1871 and 1873 after the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] ended the [[Franco-Prussian War]].

Typically, the imposition of martial law accompanies [[curfew]]s; the suspension of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[civil rights]], and [[habeas corpus]]; and the application or extension of [[military law]] or [[military justice]] to civilians. Civilians defying martial law may be subjected to [[military tribunal]] ([[court-martial]]).

==By country/region==
===Armenia===
During the [[September 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes]], Armenian prime minister [[Nikol Pashinyan]] declared martial law.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Safi|first=Michael|date=2020-09-27|title=Armenia imposes martial law after clashes with Azerbaijan|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/27/armenia-martial-law-clashes-azerbaijan|access-date=2020-09-27|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

===Australia===
The [[Black War]] was a period of violent conflict between [[1820 Settlers|British colonists]] and [[Aboriginal Australians]] in [[Tasmania]] from the mid-1820s to 1832. With an escalation of violence in the late 1820s, Lieutenant-Governor [[George Arthur]] declared martial law in November 1828—effectively providing legal immunity for killing Aboriginal people.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boyce|first=James|title=Van Diemen's Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tarto-9aKqMC|year=2010|publisher=Black Inc.|isbn=978-1-921825-39-2|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=tarto–9aKqMC&pg=PA266 266]}}</ref> It would remain in force for more than three years, the longest period of martial law in the history of the British colonies on the Australian continent. As of 2020 martial law has never been declared since the continent became a nation.

===Brunei===
Brunei has been under a martial law since a rebellion occurred on 8 December 1962 known as the [[Brunei Revolt]] and was put down by British troops from Singapore. The Sultan of Brunei, [[Hassanal Bolkiah|Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah]], is presently the head of state and also the Minister of Defense and Commander in Chief of [[Royal Brunei Armed Forces]]

===Canada===
{{See also|War Measures Act}}

The ''War Measures Act'' was a [[Parliament of Canada]] [[statute]] that allowed the government to assume sweeping emergency powers, stopping short of martial law, i.e., the military did not administer justice, which remained in the hands of the courts. The act was invoked three times: During [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the [[October Crisis of 1970]]. In 1988, the ''War Measures Act'' was replaced by the ''[[Emergencies Act]]''.

During the [[British Empire|colonial era]], martial law was proclaimed and applied in the territory of the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] during the [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Canada]] by the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1775–1776. It was also applied twice in the [[Lower Canada|Province of Lower Canada]] during the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|1837–1838 insurrections]]. On December 5, following the events of November 1837, martial law was proclaimed in the district of [[Montreal]] by Governor [[Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford|Gosford]], without the support of the [[Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada]]. It was imposed until April 27, 1838. Martial law was proclaimed a second time on November 4, 1838, this time by acting Governor [[John Colborne]], and was applied in the district of Montreal until August 24, 1839.<ref>Françoise Dubuc.

In Egypt, a [[Emergency law in Egypt|State of Emergency]] has been in effect almost continuously since 1967. Following the [[Assassination of Anwar El Sadat|assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat]] in 1981, a state of emergency was declared. Egypt has been under state of emergency ever since with few short exceptions. Parliament had renewed emergency laws every three years since they were imposed. The legislation was extended in 2003 and were due to expire at the end of May 2006; plans were in place to replace it with new anti-terrorism laws. But after the [[2006 Dahab bombings|Dahab bombings]] in April of that year, state of emergency was renewed for another two years.<ref>Simon Apiku. Egypt to lift 25-year-old emergency laws.

A State of Emergency gives military courts the power to try civilians and allows the government to detain for renewable 45-day periods and without court orders anyone deemed to be threatening state security. Public demonstrations are banned under the legislation. On 10 February 2011, the ex-president of Egypt, [[Hosni Mubarak]], promised the deletion of the relevant constitutional article that gives legitimacy to State of Emergency in an attempt to please the mass number of protesters that demanded him to resign. On 11 February 2011, the president stepped down and the vice president [[Omar Suleiman]] de facto introduced the country to martial law when transferring all civilian powers from the presidential institution to the military institution. It meant that the presidential executive powers, the parliamentary legislative powers and the judicial powers all transferred directly into the military system which may delegate powers back and forth to any civilian institution within its territory.

The military issued in its third announcement the "end of the State of Emergency as soon as order is restored in Egypt". Before martial law, the Egyptian parliament under the constitution had the civilian power to declare a State of Emergency. When in martial law, the military gained all powers of the state, including to dissolve the parliament and suspend the constitution as it did in its fifth announcement. Under martial law, the only legal framework within the Egyptian territory is the numbered announcements from the military. These announcements could for instance order any civilian laws to come back into force. The military announcements (communiques) are the de facto only current constitution and legal framework for the Egyptian territory. It means that all affairs of the state are bound by the [[Geneva Conventions]].

===Iceland===
The [[Constitution of Iceland|Icelandic constitution]] provides no mechanism for the declaration of war, martial law nor state of emergency.

===Indonesia===

On May 18, 2003, during a military activity in [[Aceh]], under the order of the [[President of Indonesia|president]], [[Indonesian Army]] Chief imposed martial law for a period of six months to offensively eliminate the [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] separatists.

===Iran===
On September 7, 1978, in response to public demonstrations protesting the perceived government involvement in the death of the son of Ayatollah Khomeini, [[Mostafa Khomeini]], [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] appointed Chief of Army Staff General [[Gholam Ali Oveisi]] as the military governor of the capital city of [[Tehran]].<ref name="MacroHistory: World History">{{cite web | title=The Iranian Revolution {{!}} King Pahlavi (the Shah) against Dissent | url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch29ir.html | publisher= [[MacroHistory: World History]] | access-date= 2010-12-23}}</ref> On September 8, the government effectively declared martial law on the capital along with several other cities throughout the country, after which further protests erupted that lead to the army opening fire on a group of protesters in Tehran's Jaleh Square on the same day. Estimates on the number of casualties vary; However, according to Iranian human rights activist [[Emadeddin Baghi]], the number of people killed was 88 of which 64 were gunned down in Jaleh Square.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emadbaghi.com/en/archives/000592.php|title=Emad Baghi :: English|website=www.emadbaghi.com}}</ref> The day is often referred to as [[Black Friday (1978)|Black Friday]]. Unable to control the unrest, the Shah dissolved the civil government headed by Prime Minister [[Jafar Sharif-Emami]] on November 6 and appointed General [[Gholam Reza Azhari]] as the prime minister whom ultimately failed in his efforts to restore order to the country. As he was preparing to leave the country, the Shah dissolved the military government and appointed [[Shapour Bakhtiar]], a reformist critic of his rule, as the new prime minister on January 4, 1979. Bakhtiar's government fell on February 11 and gave rise to the Islamic Republic and the creation of a new constitution.<ref name="MacroHistory: World History"/>

Article 79 of the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] forbids the proclamation of martial law without the approval of the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]].<ref>{{Citation|year=1989|title=Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|article=Article 79|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Iran_1989?lang=en#300|access-date=17 September 2017|quote=The proclamation of martial law is forbidden.}}</ref><ref name="WIPO">{{cite web |title=Iranian Constitution |url=https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ir/ir001en.pdf |website=WIPO |access-date=November 25, 2018}}</ref>

===Ireland===
In 1916, during the [[Easter Rising]], [[Ivor Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne|Lord Wimborne]] the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], declared martial law to maintain order in the streets of [[Dublin]]. This was later extended both in duration and geographical reach to the whole of the country with the consent of the British government. Much of Ireland was declared under martial law by the British authorities during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. A large portion of Ireland was also under de facto martial law during the [[Irish Civil War]].

The current [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish Constitution]] allows for martial law if the government declares a state of emergency, however capital punishment is prohibited in all circumstances, including a state of emergency.

===Israel===
Military administrative government was in effect from 1949 to 1966 over some geographical areas of [[Israel]] having large [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab]] populations, primarily the [[Negev]], [[Galilee]], and the [[Triangle (Israel)|Triangle]]. The residents of these areas were subject to martial law.<ref name=Feron>{{cite book|title=Palestine(s): Les déchirures|author=Valerie Féron|publisher=Paris, Editions du Felin|year=2001|isbn=2-86645-391-3}}</ref><ref name=Kodmani-Darwish>{{cite book|title=''La Diaspora Palestinienne''|author=Bassma Kodmani-Darwish|publisher=Paris: Presses Universitaires de France|year=1997|isbn=2-13-048486-7|author-link=Bassma Kodmani}}</ref> The [[Israel Defense Forces]] enforced strict residency rules. Any Arab not registered in a census taken during November 1948 was deported.<ref>"The authorities did not recognise the legality of residence in the country of anyone not registered during the November 1948 census and issued with an identity card or military pass. Anyone who had left the country for any reason before the census, and was not registered and in possession of a card or pass was regarded as an "absentee". If he subsequently infiltrated back into the country (including to his home village), he was regarded "as illegal" and could be summarily deported. The IDF repeatedly raided villages, sorted out legal from illegal residents and, usually, expelled the "returnees.""

In the 1950s, martial law ceased to be in effect for those Arab citizens living in predominantly Jewish cities, but remained in place in all Arab localities within Israel until 1966.

Following the 1967 war, in which the Israeli army occupied the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], the [[Golan Heights]] in Syria, and the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in Egypt, martial law over the [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] population as well as the Jordanian, Syrian, and Egyptian populations in these areas was put in place. In 1993, the [[Oslo I Accord|Oslo I]] agreements facilitated limited self-rule for Palestinians under the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. Officially, only parts of [[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]] in the West Bank are under martial law.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Amichai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eY1b5gRgjOIC&pg=PA185 |title=Israel's National Security Law: Political Dynamics and Historical Development|last2=Cohen|first2=Stuart|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-54914-1|language=en}}</ref>

During the [[2006 Lebanon war]], martial law was declared by Defense Minister [[Amir Peretz]] over the north of the country.

===Mauritius===
Mauritius is known as being a "Westminster" style of democracy but a peculiar system that was imposed in Mauritius during a period of civil unrest in 1968 as an emergency measure, has never been repealed and is still used by the police force there to this day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gulbul|first=Raouf|title=Arbitrary arrest|url=http://www.defimedia.info/news-sunday/nos-parliament/item/6065-raouf-gulbul--%E2%80%98arrest-first-and-enquire-afterwards-is-not-consonant-with-the-principles-of-human-rights-and-justice%E2%80%99.html|publisher=Defi|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512215528/http://www.defimedia.info/news-sunday/nos-parliament/item/6065-raouf-gulbul--%E2%80%98arrest-first-and-enquire-afterwards-is-not-consonant-with-the-principles-of-human-rights-and-justice%E2%80%99.html|archive-date=2014-05-12}}</ref> The system, which has no apparent foundation in the constitution of Mauritius, enables the police to arrest without having to demonstrate reasonable suspicion that a crime has been carried out but simply on the submission of "provisional information" to the magistrate.

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Military coups in Pakistan}}

Martial law was declared in [[Pakistan]] on 7 October 1958, by President [[Iskander Mirza]] who then appointed General [[Ayub Khan (general)|Muhammad Ayub Khan]] as the Chief Martial Law Administrator and Aziz Ahmad as Secretary General and Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator. However, three weeks later General Ayub—who had been openly questioning the authority of the government before the imposition of martial law—deposed Iskandar Mirza on 27 October 1958 and assumed the presidency that practically formalized the militarization of the political system in Pakistan. Four years later a new document, Constitution of 1962, was adopted. The second martial law was imposed on 25 March 1969, when President Ayub Khan abrogated the Constitution of 1962 and handed over power to the Army Commander-in-Chief, General [[Yahya Khan|Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan]]. On assuming the presidency, General Yahya Khan acceded to popular demands by abolishing the one-unit system in West Pakistan and ordered general elections on the principle of one man one vote.

The third was imposed by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], the first civilian to hold this post in Pakistan after the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. On 21 December 1971, Bhutto took this post as well as that of President.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Butt|first=Daud|url=https://www.thewallet.com.pk/martial-law-in-pakistan-7810|title=On the Same Page -The History of Martial Law in Pakistan|date=2020-10-24|website=The Wallet|language=en-US|access-date=2020-10-25}}</ref>

The fourth was imposed by the General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] on 5 July 1977. After several tumultuous years, which witnessed the secession of [[East Pakistan]], politician [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] took over in 1971 as the first civilian martial law administrator in recent history, imposing selective martial law in areas hostile to his rule, such as the country's largest province, [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. Following widespread [[civil disorder]], General Zia overthrew Bhutto and imposed martial law in its totality on July 5, 1977, in a bloodless [[coup d'état]]. Unstable areas were brought under control through indirect [[military action]], such as Balochistan under Martial Law Governor, General [[Rahimuddin Khan]]. Civilian government resumed in 1988 following General Zia's death in an aircraft crash.

On October 12, 1999, the government of Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] was dissolved, and the Army took control once more. But no martial law was imposed. General [[Pervez Musharraf]] took the title of [[Chief Executive]] until the [[President of Pakistan]] [[Rafiq Tarar]] resigned and General Musharraf became president. Elections were held in October 2002 and [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali|Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali]] became [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]]. Jamali premiership was followed by [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain]] and [[Shaukat Aziz]]. While the government was supposed to be run by the elected prime minister, there was a common understanding that important decisions were made by the President General Musharraf.

On November 3, 2007, President General Musharraf declared the state of emergency in the country which is claimed to be equivalent to the state of martial law as the constitution of Pakistan of 1973 was suspended, and the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court were fired.

On November 12, 2007, Musharraf issued some amendments in the Military Act, which gave the armed forces some additional powers.

===Philippines===
{{main|Martial law in the Philippines}}
During the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]], [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[José P. Laurel]] placed the [[Second Philippine Republic|Philippines]] (then a [[client state]] of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]]) under martial law via Proclamation № 29, dated 21 September 1944 and enforced the following day at 09:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]]. Proclamation № 30 was issued on 23 September, declaring the existence of a [[war|state of war]] between the [[Philippines]] and the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], effective 10:00 that day.

The country was under martial law again from 1972 to 1981 under President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. [[Proclamation № 1081]] ("Proclaiming a State of Martial Law in the Philippines") was signed on 21 September 1972 and came into force on 22 September. The official reason behind the declaration was to suppress increasing civil strife and the threat of a [[CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion|communist takeover]], particularly after a series of bombings (including the [[Plaza Miranda bombing]]) and an assassination attempt on [[Secretary of National Defense (Philippines)|Defense Minister]] [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] in [[Mandaluyong]].

The policy of martial law was initially well received, but it eventually proved unpopular as the military's [[Human rights in the Philippines|human rights]] abuses (e.g. use of [[torture]] in intelligence gathering, [[forced disappearance]]s), along with the decadence and excess of the Marcos family and their allies, had emerged. Coupled with economic downturns, these factors fermented dissent in various sectors (e.g. the urban [[middle class]]) that crystallised with the [[assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|assassination]] of jailed oppositionist [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] in 1983, and widespread fraud in the [[1986 Philippine presidential election|1986 snap elections]]. These eventually led to the [[1986 People Power Revolution]] that ousted Marcos and forced him into exile in [[Hawaii]] where he died in 1989; his rival presidential candidate and Aquino's widow, [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon]], was installed as his successor.

During this 9-year period, curfews were implemented as a safety measure. Majority of radio and television networks were suspended. Journalists who were accused of speaking against the government were taken as political prisoners, some of them to be physically abused and tortured by the authorities.

Others have stated that the implementation of Martial Law was taken advantage by the Marcos regime. Billion pesos worth of property and ill-gotten wealth was said to be acquired by Marcos' consort, [[First Lady of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]]. This alleged money laundering issue was brought back recently, particularly in the ''[[PiliPinas Debates 2016]]'' for the recently held [[2016 Philippine presidential election|Philippine Presidential Elections on May 9, 2016]]. Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos, Jr., Marcos' son, ran for the Vice Presidency and lost.

There were rumours that President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] was planning to impose martial law to end military ''[[coup d'etat]]'' plots, general civilian dissatisfaction, and criticism of her legitimacy arising from the dubious results of the [[2004 Philippine presidential election|2004 presidential elections]]. Instead, a [[2006 state of emergency in the Philippines|State of National Emergency]] was imposed in 2006 from 24 February to 3 March, in order to quash a coup attempt and quell protesters.

On 4 December 2009, President Arroyo officially placed the [[Provinces of the Philippines|Province]] of [[Maguindanao]] under a state of martial law through Proclamation № 1959.<ref name="gmanews.tv">{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/178575/arroyo-declares-martial-law-in-maguindanao|title=Arroyo declares martial law in Maguindanao province}}</ref> As with the last imposition, the declaration suspended the [[writ of habeas corpus]] in the province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20091205-240233/Martial-law-declared-in-Maguindanao |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-12-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207090214/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20091205-240233/Martial-law-declared-in-Maguindanao |archive-date=2009-12-07 }}</ref> The announcement came days after hundreds of government troops were sent to the province to raid the armories of the powerful Ampatuan clan. The Ampatuans were implicated in the [[Maguindanao Massacre|massacre of 58 persons]], including women from the rival [[Esmael Mangudadatu|Mangudadatu clan]], human rights lawyers, and 31 media workers. Cited as one of the bloodiest incidents of [[political violence]] in Philippine history, the massacre was condemned worldwide as the worst loss of life of media professionals in one day.<ref name="gmanews.tv"/>

On 23 May 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] declared martial law throughout the main southern island of [[Mindanao]], through [[Proclamation No. 216]], due to the [[Marawi crisis|attack]] of [[Maute Group]] in [[Marawi City]], [[Lanao del Sur]]. It was announced in a briefing in Moscow by Secretary [[Ernesto Abella]],<ref name="news.abs-cbn.com">{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/05/23/17/duterte-declares-martial-law-in-mindanao|title=Duterte declares Martial Law in Mindanao|first=ABS-CBN|last=News}}</ref> and will be in effect until December 2019.

Martial law was introduced in [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]] on December 13, 1981 by General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] to prevent the democratic opposition from gaining popularity and political power in the country. Thousands of people linked to the [[Solidarity Movement]], including [[Lech Wałęsa]], were arbitrarily arrested and detained. Approximately 91 deaths are attributed to the martial law, including 9 miners shot by the police force during the pacification of striking [[Wujek Coal Mine]]. Curfews, censorship and food rationing were in place. A nationwide travel ban was imposed. The martial law was eventually lifted July 22, 1983. Contemporary Polish society is divided in opinion on the necessity of introducing martial law in 1981. It is viewed by some as a lesser evil that was necessary to stop a potential [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military intervention as the [[Warsaw Pact]], which Poland signed in 1955, enabled other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries to intervene if they believed that communism was in danger.

===South Korea===
In October 1946, [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] declared martial law as a result of the [[Daegu Riot]].<ref name=champyungan>{{cite web | title=Special Project – Having an Accurate Understanding of Korea's Modern History  | publisher=Pyungkangcheil Church | url =http://www.champyungan.com/bbs/board.php?bo_table=global1&wr_id=59 | access-date = 2013-05-05 }}</ref>

===Switzerland===
There are no provisions for martial law as such in [[Switzerland]]. Under the ''Army Law'' of 1995,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/c510_10.html|title=SR 510.10 Bundesgesetz vom 3. Februar 1995 über die Armee und die Militärverwaltung (Militärgesetz, MG)|first=Bundeskanzlei |last=P|website=www.admin.ch}}</ref> the [[Swiss Army|Army]] can be called upon by [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] (state) authorities for assistance (''Assistenzdienst''). This regularly happens in the case of natural disasters or special protection requirements (e.g., for the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]]). This assistance generally requires parliamentary authorization, though, and takes place in the regular legal framework and under the civilian leadership of the cantonal authorities. On the other hand, the federal authorities are authorized to use the Army to enforce law and order when the Cantons no longer can or want to do so (''Ordnungsdienst''). With this came many significant points of reference. This power largely fell into disuse after [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/cp/d/1997Jan29.105055.7098@idz.bfi.admin.ch.html|title=Historischer Abriss zum Thema Ordnungsdienst|website=www.admin.ch|language=de|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref>

===Syria===
The martial law regime between the [[1963 Syrian coup d'état]] and 2011 is the longest ranging period of active martial law.{{disputed inline|text=disputed content|Syria: martial law vs exceptional state|date=May 2017}}<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria/syrias-assad-ends-state-of-emergency-idUSTRE72N2MC20110421|title=Syria's Assad ends state of emergency |newspaper=Reuters|date=2017-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904135026/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria/syrias-assad-ends-state-of-emergency-idUSTRE72N2MC20110421|access-date=2019-10-30|archive-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>

===Taiwan===
{{See also|Martial law in Taiwan|White Terror (Taiwan)}}
Following [[World War II]], the island of Taiwan came back to [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|China]]'s control given the impending withdrawal of [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]] and [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|colonial government]]. Martial law was declared in 1949 despite the democracy promised in the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] (the [[Republic of China]] refused to implement the constitution on Taiwan until after 1949). After the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]]-led Republic of China government lost control of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]] and retreated to Taiwan in 1949, the perceived need to suppress Communist activities in Taiwan was utilised as a rationale for not lifting martial law until thirty-eight years later in 1987, just prior to the death of then President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]].  Taiwan's period of martial law was one of the longest in modern history, after that of Syria (1967–2011).<ref name=":0" />

===Thailand===
Martial law in [[Thailand]] derives statutory authority from the Act promulgated by King [[Vajiravudh]] following the abortive [[Palace Revolt of 1912]],  entitled "Martial Law, B.E. 2457 (1914)". Many coups have been attempted or succeeded since then, but the Act governing martial law, amended in 1942, 1944, 1959 and 1972,  has remained essentially the same.<ref>{{cite web

===Turkey===
{{Main|Martial law and state of emergency in Turkey}}
Since the foundation of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] in 1923 the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] conducted three [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] and announced martial law. Martial law between 1978 and 1983 was replaced by a [[state of emergency]] in a limited number of provinces that lasted until November 2002. On July 15, 2016 the [[Peace at Home Council]] was said to have implied martial law in a broadcast on [[TRT 1|TRT]] during the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/world/europe/military-attempts-coup-in-turkey-prime-minister-says.html|title=Turkish President Returns to Istanbul in Sign Military Coup Is Faltering|first1=Tim|last1=Arango|first2=Ceylan|last2=Yeginsu|date=15 July 2016|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

===United States===
{{Main|Martial law in the United States}}
{{See also|Habeas corpus in the United States#Federal law|Suspension Clause}}

In the United States martial law has been declared for a state or other locality under various circumstances including after a direct foreign attack (Hawaii after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]; New Orleans during the [[Battle of New Orleans]]); after a major disaster (Chicago after the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871; San Francisco after the [[earthquake of 1906]]); and in response to chaos associated with protests and mob action (San Francisco during the [[1934 West Coast waterfront strike]]; Montgomery, Alabama, following the mob actions against the [[Freedom Riders#Mob violence in Montgomery|Freedom Riders]]). It has also been declared by renegade local leaders seeking to avoid arrest or challenges to their authority ([[Nauvoo, Illinois]] by Joseph Smith during the [[Illinois Mormon War]] and [[Utah]] by Governor Brigham Young during the [[Utah War]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Church History in the Fulness of Times Student Manual|year=2003|url=http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times/|access-date=March 30, 2020|page= 276,368}}</ref>

The martial law concept in the United States is closely tied with the right of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', which is in essence the right to a hearing on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend ''habeas corpus'' is related to the imposition of martial law.<ref>{{cite book|author=G. Edward White|title=Law in American History: Volume 1: From the Colonial Years Through the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP1oAgAAQBAJ|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972314-0|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP1oAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA442&dq=%22martial+law%22+%22habeas+corpus%22 442]|quote=As the above details suggest, the imposition of martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus are related, but do not perform identical functions.}}</ref> Article 1, Section 9 of the [[U.S. Constitution]] states, "The Privilege of the Writ of ''Habeas Corpus'' shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."  There have been many instances of the use of the military within the borders of the United States, such as during the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and in the South during the [[Civil Rights Movement]], but these acts are not tantamount to a declaration of martial law. The distinction must be made as clear as that between martial law and [[military justice]]: deployment of troops does not necessarily mean that the civil courts cannot function, and as the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has noted, that is one of the keys to martial law.

In [[Law of the United States|United States law]], martial law is limited by several court decisions handed down between the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War II]]. In 1878, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], which, depending on the circumstances, can forbid U.S. military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

===Yugoslavia===
During the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in 1991, a "State of Direct War Threat" was declared. Although forces from the whole [[SFRY]] were included in this conflict, martial law was never announced, but after secession, [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] declared martial law. On March 23, 1999, a "State of Direct War Threat" was declared in [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], following the possibility of [[NATO]] air-strikes. The day after strikes began, martial law was declared, which lasted until June 1999, although strikes ended on June 10, following [[Kumanovo Treaty]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
