'''''Pixels''''' is a 2015 American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[Action film|action]] [[comedy film]]<ref name="BOM"/> co-produced and directed by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] and written by [[Tim Herlihy]] and Timothy Dowling, from a story by Herlihy. A feature-length adaptation of French director Patrick Jean's [[Pixels (2010 film)|2010 short film of the same name]],<ref name="Chris-Columbus" /> the film stars [[Adam Sandler]] (who also co-produced the film), [[Kevin James]], [[Josh Gad]], [[Peter Dinklage]], [[Michelle Monaghan]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Ashley Benson]], [[Sean Bean]] and [[Jane Krakowski]]. Combining [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[video game]] characters and [[visual effects]], ''Pixels'' follows [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] misinterpreting [[video feed]]s of [[Golden age of arcade video games|classic arcade games]] as a declaration of war, resulting in them invading Earth using technology inspired by the games such as ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'', ''[[Arkanoid]]'', ''[[Galaga]]'', ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. To counter the invasion, the United States hires former [[Esports|arcade champions]] to lead the planet's defense. [[Principal photography]] on the film began on May 28, 2014 in [[Toronto]]; filming was completed in three months.

Produced by Columbus's [[1492 Pictures]] and Sandler's [[Happy Madison Productions]], ''Pixels'' was released theatrically by [[Columbia Pictures]]/[[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]] in the United States on July 24, 2015 in 2D, [[3-D film|3D]] and [[IMAX Corporation|IMAX 3D]] formats. The film grossed $244 million worldwide on a production budget of $129 million and received negative reviews from film critics.<ref name=ars>{{cite web|title=DMCA takedown laser brings down Vimeo videos with "Pixels" in title|work=[[Ars Technica]]|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/08/dmca-takedown-laser-brings-down-vimeo-videos-with-pixels-in-title/|date=August 10, 2015 |author=Sam Machkovech|quote=The Internet didn't really need another reason to hate July's critically panned Columbia Pictures film Pixels, but it got one in the form of a sketchy DMCA takedown.

==Plot==
At a [[video game]] arcade in 1982 with his friend Will Cooper, Sam Brenner discovers he can master the games by spotting patterns. Participating in a video game championship, he loses to the obnoxious Eddie "the Fireblaster" Plant in ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. A [[videocassette]] with footage of the event is included in a [[time capsule]] that is launched into space.

In the present day, Brenner has become an installer of [[Home cinema|home-theater systems]] while Cooper is the disliked [[President of the United States]]. In [[Guam]], a [[Andersen Air Force Base|U.S. military base]] is besieged by an extraterrestrial force attacking in the form of the video game ''[[Galaga]]'' and a soldier is abducted.

Brenner works at the home of divorc√©e and [[United States Navy|U.S. Army]] Lieutenant Colonel Violet van Patten, but the two are separately summoned to the [[White House]]. Upon seeing the video footage and meeting with Ludlow "the Wonder Kid" Lamonsoff, a friend he and Cooper made at the video game championship, Brenner determines an alien race has found the videocassette, misinterpreted its footage as a declaration of war, and are attacking with technology based on the games featured at the championship. This is affirmed when the aliens interrupt a television broadcast using manipulated footage from the cassette, challenging Earth to a battle where if the aliens win three rounds, they will conquer the planet. Brenner and Cooper are unable to stop one of the attacks as several aliens in the form of the Vaus from ''[[Arkanoid]]'' are used to destroy the [[Taj Mahal]], and a bystander is abducted.

Violet showcases newly-developed [[raygun]]s that are effective against the aliens as Brenner and Ludlow train [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]] to play the games. In [[London]], the aliens attack [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in the form of ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', but as the soldiers are unable to beat them, Brenner and Ludlow step in and defeat the creatures. Following the victory, the aliens send a congratulatory message and an alien taking the form of the dog from ''[[Duck Hunt (video game)|Duck Hunt]]'' as a "[[Achievement (video gaming)|trophy]]" which is given to an old woman who appeared earlier at the London attack.

Ludlow and Cooper retrieve Eddie, who is serving a prison sentence for fraud. In [[New York City]], the team learn that an alien taking the form of [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]] is on a rampage. The team is given four modified [[Mini Cooper]] cars to use as the [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|ghosts]] from the [[List of Pac-Man video games|''Pac-Man'' series]] to neutralize the threat, with the fourth one being piloted by ''Pac-Man'' creator [[Toru Iwatani]]. When the quartet confront the Pac-Man alien, Iwatani tries to reason with it peacefully, but he gets his hand bitten off and flees. The remaining three then overcome the task, but Violet notices that something about Eddie is off, as he moved at supersonic speed around the board. They win an alien taking the form of [[Q*Bert]] as their next trophy. Later during a celebratory party however, the aliens send a message declaring that someone cheated and the challenge for the planet has been forfeited. Violet's son, Matty, discovers Eddie is the perpetrator, having used a [[Cheat codes|speed cheat]] during the battle against Pac-Man. Eddie flees while Matty is abducted by the aliens.

The aliens launch a massive attack on [[Washington, D.C.]] using various characters and enemies from the championship's games. Cooper joins the team, while Ludlow stays to fight. An alien takes the form of Lady Lisa, the protagonist of ''Dojo Quest'' whom Ludlow had a crush since childhood. Ludlow persuades Lisa to choose love and she sides with the humans; Eddie, wishing to make amends, returns to fight as well. Brenner, Violet, Cooper, and Q*Bert are summoned to the aliens' mothership where they face the alien leader who takes the form of [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] on the game's starting level with the aliens' captives at the top. As the group dodges the obstacles, Brenner begins to lose hope, until Matty reveals Eddie's cheating to him, thus restoring his confidence, and Brenner eventually uses one of the stage's hammers to defeat Donkey Kong. The aliens' forces, including Lisa, then self-destruct.

The team is hailed as heroes and a peace agreement is reached with the aliens. Eddie apologizes to Brenner for his cheating, and although Ludlow is saddened that Lisa is gone, his spirits are lifted when Q*Bert shapeshifts into her. Brenner and Violet become a couple while Eddie gets to meet [[Serena Williams]] and [[Martha Stewart]]. The aliens reverse all the destruction they caused as they depart, even restoring Iwatani's hand. A year later, Lady Lisa and Ludlow get married and have Q*Bert-like children.

===Visual effects===
Most of the visual effects for ''Pixels'' were handled by [[Digital Domain]] and [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], with nine other VFX companies playing supporting roles, all under the leadership of supervisor Matthew Butler and producer Denise Davis. Early tests began in October 2013, with the majority of the effects work starting after principal photography wrapped in September 2014, and finishing by June 2015. The video game characters would be built out of boxy [[voxel]]s to resemble the low resolution [[pixel]]-based arcades, while also emitting light and having [[raster scan]] defects in its animation to appear more like they came from a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT monitor]]. Along with the actual [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] sheets, a major inspiration to build the 3D versions was the cabinet art, where  Imageworks visual effects supervisor Daniel Kramer considered that "was the intention the game creators wanted their technology to be, but the technology couldn't live up to creating that." The most complex characters to model were Q*Bert, which interacted the most with humans and had the problem of looking round despite being built out of cubes, and Donkey Kong, who the animators wanted to make sure remained recognizable even in different angles.<ref name=artofvfx/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/pixels-thinking-outside-the-voxel/|title=Pixels: thinking outside the voxel|publisher=FXGuide.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinefex.com/blog/pixels/|title="Pixels" - VFX Q&A|publisher=Cinefex Blog}}</ref>

===Music===
The score was composed by [[Henry Jackman]], who also composed music for the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] video-game-themed computer-animated film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' (2012). In June 2015, [[Waka Flocka Flame]] released a single entitled "Game On", featuring [[Good Charlotte]], which serves as part of the film's soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Trent|title=Waka Flocka Flame & Good Charlotte Go Half On Pixels: The Movie Theme Song|url=http://hiphopwired.com/2015/06/02/waka-flocka-flame-good-charlotte-game-on/|publisher=HipHopWired.com|access-date=June 3, 2015}}</ref> The song, "[[We Will Rock You]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (which is remixed by Helmut VonLichten in 2012) was heard during the film's Donkey Kong scenes.
