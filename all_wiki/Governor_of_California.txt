The '''Governor of California''' is the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. The California Governor is the chief executive of the state government and the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[California National Guard]] and the [[California State Guard]].

Established in the [[Constitution of California]], the governor's responsibilities also include making the annual [[State of the State address]] to the [[California State Legislature]], submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced. The position was created in 1849, the year before California became a state.

The current governor of California is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Gavin Newsom]], who was inaugurated on January 7, 2019.

== Gubernatorial elections, oath, and term of office ==
===Qualifications===
Any candidate for Governor must be a [[Americans|U.S. Citizen]], be a registered voter, not be convicted of a felony involving bribery, embezzlement, or extortion, and not having previously served two terms since November 6, 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/prior-elections/statewide-election-results/statewide-direct-primary-election-june-3-2014/qualifications-running-office/summary-qualifications-and-requirements-offices-governor-and-lieutenant-governor/|title=Summary of Qualifications and Requirements for the Offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor &#124; California Secretary of State|website=www.sos.ca.gov}}</ref>

===Election and oath of Governor===
Governors are elected by popular ballot and serve terms of four years, with a limit of two terms, if served after November 6, 1990.<ref name="Sec'y">{{cite web|author=Shelley, Kevin |title=Summary of Qualifications and Requirements for the Office of Governor |publisher=California Secretary of State Department |date=October 2003 |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/gov-qual.pdf |accessdate=February 23, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128084851/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/gov-qual.pdf |archivedate=November 28, 2008 }}</ref> Governors take the following oath:

<blockquote>I (Governor) do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.</blockquote>Governors take office on the first Monday after January 1 after their election.

=== Gubernatorial removal ===

There are two methods available to remove a governor before the expiration of the gubernatorial term of office:

====Impeachment and removal by the legislature====
The governor can be [[impeachment|impeached]] for "misconduct in office" by the [[California State Assembly|State Assembly]] and removed by a two-thirds vote of the [[California State Senate|State Senate]].

====Recall by the voters====
Petitions signed by California state voters equal to 12% of the last vote for the office of governor (with signatures from each of five counties equal to 1% of the last vote for Governor in the county) can launch a gubernatorial [[recall election]]. The voters can then vote on whether or not to recall the incumbent Governor, and on the same ballot can vote for a potential replacement.

If a majority of the voters in the election vote to recall the Governor, then the person who gains a plurality of the votes in the replacement race will become Governor.

The [[California gubernatorial recall election|2003 California recall]] began with a petition drive that successfully forced incumbent Democratic Governor [[Gray Davis]] into a special recall election. It marked the first time in the history of California that a governor faced a recall election: Davis was subsequently voted out of office, becoming the second governor in the history of the United States to be recalled after [[Lynn Frazier]] of North Dakota in 1921. He was replaced by Republican [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

== Relationship with Lieutenant Governor of California ==

[[File:BushCAGovs.jpg|right|thumb|Governor-elect [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (left) and Governor [[Gray Davis]] (right) with [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] in 2003]]

The [[Lieutenant Governor of California]] is separately elected during the same election, not jointly as the [[running mate]] of the gubernatorial candidate. As such, California had a Governor and a Lieutenant Governor of different parties for 28 of the 33 years between 1978 and 2011, whereas previously, this had only occurred in 1875, 1886, 1894 and 1916-1917 due to the resignation or death of an incumbent Governor or Lieutenant Governor. 

This occasionally becomes significant, since the California Constitution provides that all the powers of the Governor fall to the Lieutenant Governor whenever the governor is not in the state of California, with the Lieutenant Governor sometimes signing or vetoing legislation or making political appointments whenever the Governor leaves the state. 

In practice, there is a [[gentlemen's agreement]] for the Lieutenant Governor not to perform more than perfunctory duties while the Governor is away from the state: this [[Mike Curb#Political career|agreement was violated]] when [[Mike Curb]] was in office, as he signed several executive orders at odds with the Brown administration when Brown was out of the state. Court rulings have upheld the Lieutenant Governor's right to perform the duties and assume all of the prerogatives of Governor while the Governor is out of the state.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=In re Governorship|vol=26 |reporter=Cal.3d |opinion=110 |pinpoint=401 |court=Supreme Court of California |date=1979 |url=http://login.findlaw.com/scripts/callaw?dest=ca/cal3d/26/110.html |quote=we conclude that the Lieutenant Governor has authority to exercise all gubernatorial powers of appointment while the Governor is physically absent from the state and that the Governor has authority to withdraw the appointment until the confirmation of appointment becomes effective.}}</ref>

The Lieutenant Governor is also the president of the California State Senate.
