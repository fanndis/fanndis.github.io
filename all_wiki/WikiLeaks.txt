===Purpose===
According to the WikiLeaks website, its goal is "to bring important news and information to the public ... One of our most important activities is to publish original source material alongside our news stories so readers and historians alike can see evidence of the truth." Another of the organisation's goals is to ensure that journalists and [[whistleblower]]s are not prosecuted for emailing sensitive or classified documents. The online "drop box" is described by the WikiLeaks website as "an innovative, secure and anonymous way for sources to leak information to [WikiLeaks] journalists".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epic.org/foia/epic_v_doj_fbi_wikileaks.html |publisher=[[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] |title=EPIC v.

===Use of leaked documents in court===
On 8 February 2018, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]] unanimously ruled that a document leaked through WikiLeaks "could be admitted into evidence".

==Financing==
WikiLeaks is a self-described [[not-for-profit organisation]], funded largely by volunteers, and is dependent on public donations. Its main financing methods include conventional [[Wire transfer|bank transfers]] and [[E-commerce payment system|online payment systems]]. According to Assange, WikiLeaks' lawyers often work [[pro bono]]. Assange has said that in some cases legal aid has been donated by media organisations such as the [[Associated Press]], the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and the [[National Newspaper Publishers Association]].<ref name="leakonomy" /> Assange said in 2010 that WikiLeaks' only revenue consists of donations, but it has considered other options including auctioning early access to documents.<ref name="leakonomy" /> During September 2011, WikiLeaks began auctioning items on [[eBay]] to raise funds, and Assange told an audience at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas that the organisation might not be able to survive.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}{{Update after|2019|4|13}}

During 2010, WikiLeaks received €635,772.73 in PayPal donations, less €30,000 in PayPal fees, and €695,925.46 in bank transfers. €500,988.89 of the sum was received in the month of December, primarily as bank transfers as PayPal suspended payments on 4 December. €298,057.38 of the remainder was received in April.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cryptome.org/0003/wl-finance-en.pdf |title="Project 04: Enduring freedom of information" Preliminary transparency report 2010 |publisher=Wau-Holland-Stiftung (WHS) via [[Cryptome]] |date=26 April 2011}}</ref>

The [[Wau Holland Foundation]], one of the WikiLeaks' main funding channels, stated that they received more than €900,000 in public donations between October 2009 and December 2010, of which €370,000 has been passed on to WikiLeaks. Hendrik Fulda, vice-president of the Wau Holland Foundation, mentioned that the Foundation had been receiving twice as many donations through [[PayPal]] as through normal banks, before PayPal's decision to suspend WikiLeaks' account.

==Criticism and controversies==
===Allegations of anti-Americanism===
WikiLeaks has been accused of purposefully targeting certain states and people, and presenting its disclosures in misleading and conspiratorial ways to harm those people.<ref name=":10" /> Writing in 2012, ''Foreign Policy''<nowiki/>'s [[Joshua Keating]] stated that "nearly all its major operations have targeted the U.S. government or American corporations."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/08/16/how-wikileaks-blew-it/ |title=How WikiLeaks Blew It |website=Foreign Policy|access-date=8 November 2016}}</ref> In a 2017 speech addressing the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], former CIA Director [[Mike Pompeo]] referred to WikiLeaks as "a non-state hostile intelligence service" and described founder Julian Assange as a narcissist, fraud, and coward.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2017-speeches-testimony/pompeo-delivers-remarks-at-csis.html |title=Director Pompeo Delivers Remarks at CSIS – Central Intelligence Agency |website=www.cia.gov}}</ref>

=== Allegations of anti-Clinton and pro-Trump bias ===
Assange wrote on WikiLeaks in February 2016: "I have had years of experience in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables.

In an [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] statement, Assange criticised both Clinton and Trump, saying that "The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers."<ref>{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks criticizes both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, condemns "McCarthyite" Russia accusations |url=https://www.salon.com/2016/11/08/wikileaks-criticizes-both-hillary-clinton-and-donald-trump-condemns-mccarthyite-russia-accusations/ |work=Salon |date=9 November 2018}}</ref> In conversations that were leaked in February 2018, Assange expressed a preference for a Republican victory in the 2016 election, saying that "Dems+Media+liberals woudl [sic] then form a block to reign [sic] in their worst qualities.

Having released information that exposed the inner workings of a broad range of organisations and politicians, WikiLeaks started by 2016 to focus almost exclusively on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.<ref name=":39">{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/17/wikileaks-turned-down-leaks-on-russian-government-during-u-s-presidential-campaign/ |title=WikiLeaks Turned Down Leaks on Russian Government During U.S. Presidential Campaign |website=Foreign Policy|access-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> In the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 US presidential election]], WikiLeaks only exposed material damaging to the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks even rejected the opportunity to publish unrelated leaks, because it dedicated all its resources to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. According to ''The New York Times'', WikiLeaks timed one of its large leaks so that it would happen on the eve of the Democratic Convention.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/assange-timed-wikileaks-release-of-democratic-emails-to-harm-hillary-clinton.html |title=Assange, Avowed Foe of Clinton, Timed Email Release for Democratic Convention |last=Savage |first=Charlie |date=26 July 2016 |work=The New York Times|access-date=23 October 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The ''Washington Post'' noted that the leaks came at an important sensitive moment in the Clinton campaign, as she was preparing to announce her vice-presidential pick and unite the party behind her.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/22/on-eve-of-democratic-convention-wikileaks-releases-thousands-of-documents-about-clinton-the-campaign-and-internal-deliberations/ |title=WikiLeaks releases thousands of documents about Clinton and internal deliberations |last1=Hamburger |first1=Tom |date=22 July 2016 |work=The Washington Post|access-date=23 October 2017 |last2=Tumulty |first2=Karen |issn=0190-8286}}</ref> The [[Sunlight Foundation]], an organisation that advocates for open government, said that such actions meant that WikiLeaks was no longer striving to be transparent but rather sought to achieve political goals.<ref name=":40" />

WikiLeaks explained its actions in a 2017 statement to ''[[Foreign Policy]]'': "WikiLeaks schedules publications to maximize readership and reader engagement. During distracting media events such as the Olympics or a high profile election, unrelated publications are sometimes delayed until the distraction passes but never are rejected for this reason."<ref name=":39" /> On 7 October 2016, an hour after the media had begun to dedicate wall-to-wall coverage of the revelation that Trump had bragged on video about sexually harassing women, WikiLeaks began to release emails hacked from the personal account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.<ref name=":42">{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/07/politics/one-year-access-hollywood-russia-podesta-email/index.html |title=Access Hollywood and emails: One year later |last=Cohen |first=Marshall |publisher=CNN|access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=":41">{{Cite news |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/18/john-podesta/its-true-wikileaks-dumped-podesta-emails-hour-afte/ |title=True: Wikileaks dumped Podesta emails hour after Trump video |work=@politifact|access-date=24 October 2017 |language=en}}</ref> CNN notes that due to extensive coverage of the Trump tapes, the leaks were an "afterthought" in news coverage.<ref name=":42" /> Podesta suggested that the emails were timed to deflect attention from the Trump tapes.<ref name=":41" />

==== Correspondence between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump Jr. ====
In November 2017, it was revealed that the WikiLeaks Twitter account corresponded with [[Donald Trump Jr.]] during the 2016 presidential election.<ref name=":45">{{Cite news|last=Ioffe |first=Julia|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-secret-correspondence-between-donald-trump-jr-and-wikileaks/545738/ |title=The Secret Correspondence Between Donald Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks |work=The Atlantic|access-date=13 November 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref> The correspondence shows how WikiLeaks actively solicited the co-operation of Trump Jr., a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the Trump campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it looked as if the Trump campaign would lose.<ref name=":45" /> WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share a claim by Assange that Hillary Clinton had wanted to attack him with drones.<ref name=":45" /> WikiLeaks also shared a link to a site that would help people to search through WikiLeaks documents.<ref name=":45" /> Trump Jr. shared both. After the election, WikiLeaks also requested that the president-elect push Australia to appoint Assange as ambassador to the US. After ''The New York Times'' published a fragment of Donald Trump's tax returns for one year, WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. for one or more of his father's tax returns, explaining that it would be in his father's best interest because it would "dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality" and not come "through the most biased source (e.g. NYT/MSNBC)."<ref name=":45" /> WikiLeaks also asked Trump Jr. to leak his own e-mails to them days after ''The New York Times'' broke a story about e-mail correspondence between Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-affiliated lawyer; WikiLeaks said that it would be "beautifully confounding" for them to publish the e-mails and that it would deprive other news outlets from putting a negative spin on the correspondence.<ref name=":45" /> Trump Jr. provided this correspondence to congressional investigators looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election.<ref name=":45" />

In April 2017, the WikiLeaks Twitter account suggested that the [[Khan Shaykhun chemical attack]], which international human rights organisations and governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, France, and Israel attributed to the Syrian government, was a [[false flag]] attack.<ref name=":21">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/04/06/trump-loves-a-conspiracy-theory-now-his-allies-in-the-media-say-hes-falling-for-one-in-syria/ |title=Analysis {{!}} Trump loves a conspiracy theory.

In April 2017, CIA Director [[Mike Pompeo]] stated: "It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia." Pompeo said that the US Intelligence Community had concluded that Russia's "primary propaganda outlet," [[RT (TV network)|RT]] had "actively collaborated" with WikiLeaks.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cia-director-calls-wikileaks-a-non-state-hostile-intelligence-service/ |title=CIA director calls WikiLeaks Russia-aided "non-state hostile intelligence service" |author=Kathryn Watson |date=13 April 2017 |publisher=CBS News}}</ref>

In the wake of the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]] in January 2015, the WikiLeaks Twitter account wrote that "the Jewish pro-censorship lobby legitimized attacks", referring to the trial of [[Maurice Sinet]].<ref name=":2" /> In July 2016, the same account suggested that [[triple parentheses]], or (((echoes))) – a tool used by neo-Nazis to identify Jews on Twitter, appropriated by several Jews online out of solidarity – had been used as a way for "establishment climbers" to identify one another.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /> In leaked internal conversations, the WikiLeaks Twitter account, thought to be controlled by Assange at the time, discussed an article critical of WikiLeaks by [[Associated Press]] reporter Raphael Satter. The WikiLeaks Twitter account went on call the journalist "a rat", adding "but he's Jewish" and encouraged others to troll him.<ref name=":46" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43072261|title='Anti-Clinton' Wikileaks chat leaked|date=15 February 2018|access-date=19 April 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Exaggerated and misleading descriptions of the contents of leaks===
WikiLeaks has been criticised for making misleading claims about the contents of its leaks.<ref name=":7">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/opinion/the-truth-about-the-wikileaks-cia-cache.html |title=The Truth About the WikiLeaks C.I.A.

The second step is to sensationalise the material with misleading news releases and tweets. The third step is to sit back and watch as the news media unwittingly promotes the WikiLeaks agenda under the auspices of independent reporting."<ref name=":7" />

After the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]], WikiLeaks announced that it would release e-mails belonging to Turkey's ruling conservative [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]]. WikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents as a response to the [[2016–present purges in Turkey|Turkish government's crackdown]] on real or alleged government opponents that followed the coup attempt.<ref name="ThReut_WikiLeaks"/> When these e-mails were released, however, it "was nothing but mundane mailing lists of tens of thousands of ordinary people who discussed politics online. Back then, too, the ruse worked: Many Western journalists had hyped these non-leaks."<ref name=":7" />

=== Inadequate curation and violations of personal privacy ===
WikiLeaks has drawn criticism for violating the personal privacy of individuals and inadequately curating its content. These critics include transparency advocates, such as [[Edward Snowden]], the [[Sunlight Foundation]] and the [[Federation of American Scientists]].<ref name=":31" />

WikiLeaks has published individuals' [[Social Security number]]s, medical information, and credit card numbers.<ref name=":12" /> An analysis by the Associated Press found that WikiLeaks had in one of its mass-disclosures published "the personal information of hundreds of people – including sick children, rape victims and mental health patients".<ref name=":12" /> WikiLeaks has named teenage rape victims, and outed an individual arrested for homosexuality in Saudi Arabia.<ref name=":12" /> Some of WikiLeaks' cables "described patients with psychiatric conditions, seriously ill children or refugees".<ref name=":12" /> An analysis of WikiLeaks' Saudi cables "turned up more than 500 passport, identity, academic or employment files ... three dozen records pertaining to family issues in the cables – including messages about marriages, divorces, missing children, elopements and custody battles. Many are very personal, like the marital certificates that proclaims whether the bride was a virgin. Others deal with Saudis who are deeply in debt, including one man who says his wife stole his money. One divorce document details a male partner's infertility. Others identify the partners of women suffering from sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C."<ref name=":12" /> Two individuals named in the DNC leaks were targeted by identity thieves following WikiLeaks' release of their Social Security and credit card information.<ref name=":12" /> In its leak of DNC e-mails, WikiLeaks revealed the details of an ordinary staffer's suicide attempt and brought attention to it through a tweet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2016/10/13/hacked-private-emails/ |title=Publishing Hacked Private Emails Can Be a Slippery Slope |website=Fortune|access-date=6 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/zeyneptufekci/dear-france-you-just-got-hacked-dont-make-the-same-mistakes |title=Dear France: You Just Got Hacked.

Cohen]], a fellow at the [[The Century Foundation|Century Foundation]], argues that "data dumps like these represent a threat to our already shrinking zone of privacy."<ref name=":13" /> He noted that the willingness of WikiLeaks to publish information of this type encourages hacking and cyber theft: "With ready and willing amplifiers, what's to deter the next cyberthief from stealing a company's database of information and threatening to send it to Wikileaks if a list of demands aren't met?"<ref name=":13" />

The [[Sunlight Foundation]], a nonprofit that advocates for open government, has criticised WikiLeaks for inadequate curation of its content and for "weaponised transparency," writing that with the DNC leaks, "Wikileaks again failed the due diligence review we expect of putatively journalistic entities when it published the personal information of ordinary citizens, including passport and Social Security numbers contained in the hacked emails of Democratic National Committee staff. We are not alone in raising ethical questions about Wikileaks' shift from whistleblower to platform for weaponised transparency.

In July 2016, [[Edward Snowden]] criticised WikiLeaks for insufficiently curating its content.<ref name=":8" /> When Snowden made data public, he did so by working with the ''Washington Post'', the ''Guardian'' and other news organisations, choosing only to make documents public which exposed National Security Agency surveillance programs.<ref name=":8" /> Content that compromised national security or exposed sensitive personal information was withheld.<ref name=":8" /> WikiLeaks, on the other hand, made little effort to do either, Snowden said. WikiLeaks responded by accusing Snowden of pandering to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.<ref name=":8" />

University of North Carolina Professor [[Zeynep Tufekci]] has also criticised WikiLeaks for exposing sensitive personal information.<ref name=":9" /> She argued that data dumps, such as WikiLeaks, which violate personal privacy without being in the public interest "threaten our ability to dissent by destroying privacy and unleashing a glut of questionable information that functions, somewhat unexpectedly, as its own form of censorship, rather than as a way to illuminate the maneuverings of the powerful."<ref name=":9" />

===Internal conflicts and lack of transparency===
Within WikiLeaks, there has been public disagreement between founder and spokesperson [[Julian Assange]] and [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]], the website's former German representative who was suspended by Assange. Domscheit-Berg announced on 28 September 2010 that he was leaving the organisation due to internal conflicts over management of the website.<ref name="bates">{{cite news |url=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/28/wikileaks-woes-grow-as-spokesman-quits-site/ |title=WikiLeaks' Woes Grow as Spokesman Quits Site |author=Bates, Theunis |date=28 September 2010 |work=AOL News|access-date=22 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209122932/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/28/wikileaks-woes-grow-as-spokesman-quits-site/ |archivedate=9 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.physorg.com/news205093515.html |title=WikiLeaks chief lashes out at media during debate |last=Satter |first=Raphael G. |date=30 September 2010 |publisher=PhysOrg.com|access-date=22 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020041136/http://www.physorg.com/news205093515.html |archivedate=20 October 2010 |url-status=live |agency=Associated Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/09/28/businessinsider-wikileaks-spokesman-quits.DTL |title=WikiLeaks Spokesman Quits, Blasts Founder Julian Assange As Paranoid Control Freak, Admits To Using Fake Name |last=Blodget |first=Henry |date=28 September 2010 |work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=12 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306180126/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fg%2Fa%2F2010%2F09%2F28%2Fbusinessinsider-wikileaks-spokesman-quits.DTL |archivedate=6 March 2012 |url-status=live |authorlink=Henry Blodget }}</ref>

===Lawsuit by the Democratic National Committee===
{{Main|Democratic National Committee v. Russian Federation}}
On 20 April 2018, the Democratic National Committee filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit in [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|federal district court in Manhattan]] against Russia, the Trump campaign, WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, alleging a conspiracy to disrupt the [[2016 United States presidential election]] in Trump's favour.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hamburger|first1=Tom|last2=Helderman|first2=Rosalind S.|last3=Nakashima|first3=Ellen|date=20 April 2018|title=Democratic Party sues Russia, Trump campaign and WikiLeaks alleging 2016 campaign conspiracy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-party-files-lawsuit-alleging-russia-the-trump-campaign-and-wikileaks-conspired-to-disrupt-the-2016-campaign/2018/04/20/befe8364-4418-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html|work=The Washington Post|access-date=20 April 2018 }}</ref> The suit was dismissed [[with prejudice]] on 30 July 2019. In his judgement, Judge [[John Koeltl]] said that WikiLeaks "did not participate in any wrongdoing in obtaining the materials in the first place" and was therefore within the law in publishing the information. He also said that the DNC case was "entirely divorced" from the facts. The suit could not be refiled due to its "substantive legal defect".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Re |first1=Gregg |title=Judge dismisses DNC lawsuit against Trump campaign, Russia, WikiLeaks over hacking |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/judge-dismisses-dnc-lawsuit-against-trump-campaign-russia-wikileaks-over-hacking/ar-AAF5bE9?item=personalization_enabled%3afalse |work = msm|accessdate=31 July 2019 |date=31 July 2019}}</ref> The federal judge also wrote “The DNC’s interest in keeping ‘donor lists’ and ‘fundraising strategies’ secret is dwarfed by the newsworthiness of the documents as a whole”...“If WikiLeaks could be held liable for publishing documents concerning the DNC’s political financial and voter-engagement strategies simply because the DNC labels them ‘secret’ and trade secrets, then so could any newspaper or other media outlet.”

Koeltl also said U.S. courts were not the place for the DNC to seek damages against Russia over the hacking. “Relief from the alleged activities of the Russian Federation should be sought from the political branches of the Government and not from the court”.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/30/dnc-lawsuit-trump-campaign-russia-email-hack-1441166 |title = Judge dismisses DNC suit against Trump campaign, Russia over email hack}}</ref>
