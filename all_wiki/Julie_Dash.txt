==Film career==

===Early career===
During film school, Dash was influenced by avant-garde, Latin American, African and Russian cinema.<ref name="Buckley"/> Dash's film work began to take on a new direction after film school. Dash said in a 1991 interview with the ''[[Village Voice]]'', "I stopped making documentaries after discovering [[Toni Morrison]], [[Toni Cade Bambara]], and [[Alice Walker]]. I wondered, why can't we see movies like this? I realized I needed to learn how to make narrative movies."<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/04/14/a-village-voice-dossier-julie-dash-and-daughters-of-the-dust/#s9|title=Of Homegirl Goddesses and Geechee Women: the Africentric Cinema of Julie Dash|last=Tate|first=Greg|date=June 4, 1991|work=Village Voice|issue=23|volume=36|page=79}}</ref>  Being inspired by the novels of these black women authors led to her decision to direct dramatic films.<ref name=":1" />

Her 1975 short film ''[[Four Women (1978 film)|Four Women]]'' is based on the ballad [[Four Women (song)|“Four Women”]] by [[Nina Simone]]. In the song, four women are portrayed (all by the dancer Linda Martina Young): Aunt Sarah, a slave, Saffronia, a mixed race woman, Sweet Thing, a prostitute, and Peaches, as a representation of black women overcoming racial and gender-specific forms of oppression.<ref>{{Cite book|title=L.A. Rebellion: Creating a New Black Cinema|last=Field|first=Allyson|publisher=University of California Press|year=2015}}</ref> [[Stereotype]]s of black women are directly addressed, asking the audience to address their own [[bias]]es and stereotypes.

From 1978 to 1980, Dash worked as member of the Classifications and Ratings Administrations for the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Duckworth|first=Margaret|title=Notable Black American Women: Book II|publisher=Gale|year=1995|isbn=9780810391772|pages=160}}</ref> She had a special assignment screening at the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] to review a screening of short films in the Marché du Cinema.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

{{Main|Illusions (1982 film)}}
She wrote and directed the short film ''[[Illusions by Julie Dash|Illusions]]'' (34 minutes), which explores [[Racial discrimination|racial]] and [[Sexual orientation discrimination|sexual discrimination]] in [[Hollywood]] and American society.<ref>[http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/blogs/la-rebellion/2011/11/14/codes-and-closets-julie-dashs-illusions "CODES AND CLOSETS: JULIE DASH'S ILLUSIONS"], UCLA Film and Television Archive, 14 November 2011</ref> Released in 1982, it was her first to earn more widespread success and attention.<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu" /> Set in 1942 in the fictional National Studios, it follows a black woman executive, Mignon Duprée, who has "[[passing (racial identity)|passed]]" for white to achieve her position. Also featured is Ester Jeeter, a black woman who dubs the singing voice in musicals for a white Hollywood star. They work in an industry based on creating images and alternative realities. The film explores Mignon's dilemma, Ester's struggle to get roles as an actress and singer rather than dub for others, and the uses of cinema in wartime: three illusions in conflict with reality.<ref>[http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c300.shtml "Julie Dash: 'Illusions'"], Women Make Movies</ref>

''Illusions'' received the 1985 [[Black American Cinema Society]] Award and the [[Black Filmmaker Foundation's Jury]] Prize in 1989 as best film of the decade. [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[LA Times]]'' described it as "a gripping critique of the power of the movies to shape perception," while exploring the illusions created by Hollywood, as well as the illusion of [[Race (human categorization)|racial identity]].

===''Daughters of the Dust'' (1991)===

The film, set in 1902, revolves around three generations of [[Gullah]] women in the Peazant family on [[Saint Helena Island (South Carolina)|St. Helena Island]] off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina. Innovative with its use of Gullah dialogue and interwoven story-lines among the predominately female cast, the film focuses on ancestral and matriarchal story lines as well as the history of former slaves who settled on the island and formed an independent community there. The screenplay was written in the dialect of the island settlers with no subtitles, resulting in an immersive language experience.<ref>Dash, Julie; Cade Bambara, Toni; hooks, bell. (1992).

''[[The New York Times]]'' called Dash a "strikingly original film maker," noting that "for all its harsh allusions to [[slavery]] and hardship, the film is an extended, wildly lyrical meditation on the power of African cultural [[iconography]] and the spiritual resilience of the generations of women who have been its custodians."<ref name=NYTHolden>Holden, Stephen (January 16, 1992) [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/16/movies/review-film-daughters-of-the-dust-the-demise-of-a-tradition.html "Review/Film; 'Daughters Of the Dust': The Demise Of a Tradition,"] ''The New York Times''.
