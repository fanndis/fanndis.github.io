'''The Walt Disney Company''', commonly known as '''Disney''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|z|n|i}}),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/disney_walt|title=Disney, Walt {{!}} Definition of Disney, Walt by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=October 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024181818/https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/disney_walt|archive-date=October 24, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> is an American diversified multinational [[media conglomerate|mass media and entertainment conglomerate]] headquartered at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios complex]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[California]].

Disney was originally founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers [[Walt Disney|Walt]] and [[Roy O. Disney]] as the '''Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio'''; it also operated under the names '''The Walt Disney Studio''' and '''Walt Disney Productions''' before officially changing its name to The Walt Disney Company in 1986. The company established itself as a leader in the [[American animation]] industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks.

Since the 1980s, Disney has created and acquired corporate divisions in order to market more mature content than is typically associated with its flagship family-oriented brands. The company is known for its [[film studio]] division, [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]], which includes [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], [[Pixar]], [[Marvel Studios]], [[Lucasfilm]], [[20th Century Studios]], [[Searchlight Pictures]], and [[Blue Sky Studios]]. Disney's other main business units include divisions in television, broadcasting, streaming media, theme park resorts, consumer products, publishing, and international operations. Through these various segments, Disney owns and operates the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC broadcast network]]; cable television networks such as [[Disney Channel]], [[ESPN]], [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], [[FX (TV channel)|FX]], and [[National Geographic (American TV channel)|National Geographic]]; publishing, merchandising, music, and theater divisions; [[direct-to-consumer]] streaming services such as [[Disney+]], [[Hulu]], [[ESPN+]] and [[Hotstar]]; and [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products]], a group of 14 theme parks, resort hotels, and cruise lines around the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/destinations/ |title=Parks & Destinations {{!}} Walt Disney World Resort |website=disneyworld.disney.go.com |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202114300/https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/destinations/ |archive-date=February 2, 2017 |access-date=June 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2014/07/14/the-secrets-behind-disneys-2-2-billion-theme-park-profits/#271d2ecd584f |title=The Secrets Behind Disney's $2.2 Billion Theme Park Profits |last=Sylt |first=Christian |work=Forbes |access-date=June 15, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215130839/https://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2014/07/14/the-secrets-behind-disneys-2-2-billion-theme-park-profits/ |archive-date=February 15, 2017}}</ref> Cartoon character [[Mickey Mouse]], created in 1928 by Walt Disney and [[Ub Iwerks]], is one of the world's most recognizable characters and serves as the company's official mascot.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

In early 1923, [[Kansas City, Missouri]], animator [[Walt Disney]] created a short film entitled ''[[Alice's Wonderland]]'', which featured child actress [[Virginia Davis]] interacting with animated characters.

=== 1928–1934: Mickey Mouse and ''Silly Symphonies'' ===
In 1928, to recover from the loss of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney came up with the idea of a mouse character named Mortimer while on a train headed to California, drawing up a few simple drawings. The mouse was later renamed [[Mickey Mouse]] (Disney's wife, Lillian, disliked the sound of 'Mortimer Mouse') and starred in several Disney produced films. [[Ub Iwerks]] refined Disney's initial design of Mickey Mouse.<ref name=fu/> Disney's first sound film ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', a cartoon starring Mickey, was released on November 18, 1928<ref name="y1928 group=ChWDC" group="ChWDC">{{Cite web |url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1928.htm |title=1928 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019094422/http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1928.htm |archive-date=October 19, 2013 |access-date=December 15, 2013}}</ref> through [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]]' distribution company.<ref name=fu/> It was the first Mickey Mouse sound cartoon released, but the third to be created, behind ''[[Plane Crazy]]'' and ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]''.<ref name=y1928 group=ChWDC>{{cite web|title=1928 |url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1928.htm |accessdate=December 15, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019094422/http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1928.htm |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}</ref> ''Steamboat Willie'' was an immediate smash hit, and its initial success was attributed not just to Mickey's appeal as a character, but to the fact that it was the first cartoon to feature [[sound film|synchronized sound]].<ref name=fu/> Disney used Pat Powers' Cinephone system, created by Powers using [[Lee de Forest]]'s [[Phonofilm]] system.<ref name=y1928 group=ChWDC/> ''Steamboat Willie'' premiered at B.

Disney continued to produce cartoons with Mickey Mouse and other characters,<ref name=fu/> and began the [[Silly Symphony]] series with [[Columbia Pictures]] signing on as Symphonies distributor in August 1929. In September 1929, theater manager Harry Woodin requested permission to start a Mickey Mouse Club, which Walt approved. In November, test comics strips were sent to [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]], who requested additional samples to show to the publisher, [[William Randolph Hearst]]. On December 16, the Walt Disney Studios partnership was reorganized as a corporation with the name of '''Walt Disney Productions, Limited''', with a merchandising division – Walt Disney Enterprises, and two subsidiaries – Disney Film Recording Company, Limited; and Liled Realty and Investment Company, for real estate holdings. Walt and his wife held 60 percent (6,000 shares) and Roy owned 40 percent of WD Productions. On December 30, King Features signed its first newspaper, [[New York Daily Mirror|New York Mirror]], to publish the [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] with Walt's permission.<ref name="y1929 group=ChWDC" group="ChWDC">{{Cite web |url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1929.htm |title=1929 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019094337/http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1929.htm |archive-date=October 19, 2013 |access-date=December 15, 2013}}</ref>

In 1932, Disney signed an exclusive contract with [[Technicolor]] (through the end of 1935) to produce cartoons in color, beginning with ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'' (1932). Disney released cartoons through Powers' Celebrity Pictures (1928–1930), [[Columbia Pictures]] (1930–1932), and [[United Artists]] (1932–1937).<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QljKdIYzncoC&lpg=PA116&pg=PA113#v=onepage&q=disney%20united%20artists |title=United Artists, Volume 1, 1919–1950: The Company Built by the Stars |last=Balio |first=Tino |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780299230036 |pages=113–116 |access-date=August 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502015817/http://books.google.com/books?id=QljKdIYzncoC&lpg=PA116&pg=PA113#v=onepage&q=disney%20united%20artists |archive-date=May 2, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The popularity of the Mickey Mouse series allowed Disney to plan for his first feature-length animation.<ref name=fu/> The feature film ''[[Walt Before Mickey]]'', based on the book by [[Diane Disney Miller]], featured these moments in the studio's history.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2014/09/walt-before-mickey-trailer-disney-832136 |title="Walt Before Mickey" Trailer |date=September 9, 2014 |website=Deadline |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106192931/http://deadline.com/2014/09/walt-before-mickey-trailer-disney-832136/ |archive-date=November 6, 2014}}</ref>

=== 1934–1950: ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', World War II, and package films ===
[[File:Oldanimationbuilding.JPG|thumb|right|The original Animation Building at the Walt Disney Studios.]]
Deciding to push the boundaries of animation even further, Disney began production of his first feature-length animated film in 1934. Taking three years to complete, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', premiered in December 1937 and by 1939 became the highest-grossing film of that time.<ref name="GablerBook">{{Cite book |title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination |last=Gabler |first=Neal |publisher=Random House |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-679-75747-4 |location=New York |pages=276–277}}</ref> ''Snow White'' was released through [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]], which had assumed distribution of Disney's product in July 1937,<ref name="y1937 group=ChWDC" group="ChWDC">{{Cite web |url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1937.htm |title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019094309/http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1937.htm |archive-date=October 19, 2013 |access-date=December 15, 2013}}</ref> after United Artists attempted to attain future television rights to the Disney shorts.<ref name="TIME">{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758747-5,00.html |title=Cinema: Man & Mouse |date=December 27, 1937 |work=TIME |access-date=May 17, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628215638/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C758747-5%2C00.html |archive-date=June 28, 2011}}</ref> Using the profits from ''Snow White'', Disney financed the construction of a new {{convert|51|acre|m2|adj=on}} studio complex in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California.

The studio continued releasing animated shorts and features, such as ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), and ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942).<ref name=fu/> After World War II began, box office profits declined. When the United States entered the war after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], many of Disney's animators were drafted into the armed forces. The U.S. and Canadian governments commissioned the studio [[Walt Disney's World War II propaganda production|to produce training and propaganda films]]. By 1942, 90 percent of its 550 employees were working on war-related films.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iU4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA2&pg=PA61#v=onepage |title=Walt Disney Goes to War |date=August 31, 1942 |work=Life |access-date=November 20, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511163309/http://books.google.com/books?id=iU4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA2&pg=PA61 |archive-date=May 11, 2013 |page=61}}</ref> Films such as the feature ''[[Victory Through Air Power (film)|Victory Through Air Power]]'' and the short ''[[Education for Death]]'' (both 1943) were meant to increase public support for the war effort. Even the studio's characters joined the effort, as [[Donald Duck]] appeared in a number of comical propaganda shorts, including the Academy Award-winning ''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' (1943).

With limited staff and little operating capital during and after the war, Disney's feature films during much of the 1940s were "package films", or collections of shorts, such as ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' (1944) and ''[[Melody Time]]'' (1948), which performed poorly at the box office. At the same time, the studio began producing live-action films and documentaries. ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946) and ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]'' (1948) featured animated segments, while the ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'' series, which included such films as ''[[Seal Island (film)|Seal Island]]'' (1948) and ''[[The Vanishing Prairie]]'' (1954), were also popular. Eight of the films in the series won Academy Awards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.waltdisney.org/storyboard/walt-and-true-life-adventures |title=Walt and the True-Life Adventures |last=Korkis |first=Jim |website=The Walt Disney Family Museum |publisher=The Walt Disney Family Museum |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208003726/http://www.waltdisney.org/storyboard/walt-and-true-life-adventures |archive-date=December 8, 2014 |access-date=December 4, 2014}}</ref>

=== 1950–1966: Television, Disneyland, and Walt Disney's death ===
The release of ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' in 1950 proved that feature-length animation could still succeed in the marketplace. Other releases of the period included ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951) and ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), both in production before the war began, and Disney's first all-live action feature, ''[[Treasure Island (1950 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1950). Other early all-live-action Disney films included ''[[The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men]]'' (1952), ''[[The Sword and the Rose]]'' (1953), and ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954).

[[File:Waltopening.jpg|upright=0.9|left|thumb|Walt Disney at the grand opening of [[Disneyland]], July 1955.]]
In December 1950, Walt Disney Productions and [[the Coca-Cola Company]] teamed up for Disney's first venture into television, the [[NBC]] television network special ''One Hour in Wonderland''. In October 1954, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network launched Disney's first regular television series. In 1954, Walt Disney used his ''Disneyland'' series to unveil what would become [[Disneyland]], an idea conceived out of a desire for a place where parents and children could both have fun at the same time. On July 18, 1955, Walt Disney opened Disneyland to the general public. On July 17, 1955, Disneyland was previewed with a live television broadcast hosted by [[Robert Cummings]], [[Art Linkletter]], and [[Ronald Reagan]]. After a shaky start, Disneyland continued to grow and attract visitors from across the country and around the world. A major expansion in 1959 included the addition of America's first [[Disneyland Monorail System|monorail system]]. For the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], Disney prepared four separate attractions for various sponsors, each of which would find its way to Disneyland in one form or another. During this time, Walt Disney was also secretly scouting out new sites for a second Disney theme park. In November 1965, "Disney World" was announced, with plans for theme parks, hotels, and even a model city on thousands of acres of land purchased outside of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wdwmagic.com/walt-disney-world-history.htm |title=Walt Disney World History |website=www.wdwmagic.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920235120/https://www.wdwmagic.com/walt-disney-world-history.htm |archive-date=September 20, 2018 |access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>

Disney continued to focus its talents on television throughout the 1950s. Its weekday afternoon children's television program ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'', featuring its roster of young "Mouseketeers", premiered in 1955 to great success, as did the ''[[Davy Crockett (miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'' [[miniseries]], starring [[Fess Parker]] and broadcast on the ''Disneyland'' anthology show.<ref name=fu/> Two years later, the ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' series would prove just as popular, running for two seasons on ABC.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.billcotter.com/zorro/history-of-series.htm |title=Zorro – A history of the series |last=Cotter |first=Bill |year=2009 |website=Walt Disney's Zorro |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122112749/http://www.billcotter.com/zorro/history-of-series.htm |archive-date=November 22, 2012 |access-date=August 15, 2013}}</ref> Despite such success, Walt Disney Productions invested little into television ventures in the 1960s,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} with the exception of the long-running anthology series, later known as ''The Wonderful World of Disney''.<ref name=fu/>

Disney's film studios stayed busy as well, averaging five or six releases per year during this period. While the production of shorts slowed significantly during the 1950s and 1960s, the studio released a number of popular animated features, like ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959) and ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (1961), which introduced a new [[Xerography#Uses in animation|xerography]] process to transfer the drawings to [[Cel|animation cels]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://animationarchive.net/Feature%20Films/101%20Dalmatians/Production%20Facts/ |title=Production Facts |last=Montgomery |first=Tim |website=The Unofficial Disney Animation Archive |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005015357/http://animationarchive.net/Feature%20Films/101%20Dalmatians/Production%20Facts/ |archive-date=October 5, 2013 |access-date=September 3, 2013}}</ref> Disney's live-action releases were spread across a number of genres, including historical fiction (''[[Johnny Tremain (film)|Johnny Tremain]]'', 1957), adaptations of children's books (''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'', 1960) and modern-day comedies (''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', 1959).

The 1970s opened with the release of Disney's first "post-Walt" animated feature, ''[[The Aristocats]]'', followed by a return to fantasy musicals in 1971's ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''.<ref name=fu/> ''[[Blackbeard's Ghost]]'' was another successful film during this period.<ref name=fu/> On October 1, 1971, [[Walt Disney World]] opened to the public, with Roy Disney dedicating the facility in person later that month.

On December 20, 1971, Roy O. Disney died of a stroke. He left the company under the control of [[Donn Tatum]], [[Card Walker]], and Walt's son-in-law [[Ron W. Miller|Ron Miller]], each trained by Walt and Roy.

However, the animation studio saw success with ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1973), ''[[The Rescuers]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' (1981).

In 1980, Disney launched Walt Disney Home Video to take advantage of the newly emerging videocassette market. On April 18, 1983, [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] debuted as a subscription-level channel on cable systems nationwide, featuring its large library of classic films and TV series, along with original programming and family-friendly third-party offerings.

Walt Disney World received much of the company's attention through the 1970s and into the 1980s. In 1978, Disney executives announced plans for the second Walt Disney World theme park, [[Epcot|EPCOT Center]], which would open in October 1982. Inspired by [[EPCOT (concept)|Walt Disney's dream of a futuristic model city]], EPCOT Center was built as a "permanent World's Fair", complete with exhibits sponsored by major American corporations, as well as pavilions based on the cultures of other nations. In Japan, [[The Oriental Land Company]] partnered with Walt Disney Productions to build the first Disney theme park outside of the United States, [[Tokyo Disneyland]], which opened in April 1983. Despite the success of the Disney Channel and its new theme park creations, Walt Disney Productions was financially vulnerable. Its film library was valuable but offered few current successes, and its leadership team was unable to keep up with other studios, particularly the works of [[Don Bluth]], who defected from Disney in 1979. By the early 1980s, the parks were generating 70 percent of Disney's income.<ref name=fu/>

In 1984, financier [[Saul Steinberg (businessman)|Saul Steinberg]]'s Reliance Group Holdings launched a [[hostile takeover]] bid for Walt Disney Productions,<ref name=fu/> with the intent of selling off some of its operations.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/12/business/highlights-of-struggle-for-disney.html |title=HIGHLIGHTS OF STRUGGLE FOR DISNEY |date=June 12, 1984 |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 4, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115163142/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/12/business/highlights-of-struggle-for-disney.html |archive-date=January 15, 2014}}</ref> Disney bought out Reliance's 11.1% stake in the company.

Eisner emphasized Touchstone, with ''[[Down and Out in Beverly Hills]]'' (1985) leading to increased output with ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'' (1987), ''[[Dead Poets Society]]'' (1989), ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990) and additional hits. Eisner used expanding cable and home video markets to sign deals using Disney shows and films, making a long-term deal with [[Showtime Networks]] for Disney/Touchstone releases through 1996 and entering television with syndication and distribution for TV series such as ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]''.

Buoyed by the success of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' in 1988, Disney's [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|flagship animation studio]] enjoyed a series of commercial and critical successes known as the [[Disney Renaissance]], with such films as ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989), ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), and ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994). In addition, the company successfully entered the field of television animation with a number of lavishly-budgeted and acclaimed series such as ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears|Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'', ''[[DuckTales]]'', ''[[Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers]]'', ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', ''[[TaleSpin]]'', ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'' and ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dizavenue.com/2017/07/remembering-disney-afternoon.html |title=Disney Avenue: Remembering The Disney Afternoon |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808154424/http://www.disneyavenue.com/2017/07/remembering-disney-afternoon.html |archive-date=August 8, 2017}}</ref> Disney moved to first place in box office receipts by 1988 and had increased revenues by 20 percent every year.<ref name=fu/>

The deal included Henson's programming library and Muppet characters (excluding the Muppets created for ''[[Sesame Street]]''), as well as Jim Henson's personal creative services.

In 1991, hotels, home video distribution, and Disney merchandising became 28 percent of total company revenues while international revenues contributed 22 percent of total revenues. The company committed its studios in the first quarter of 1991 to produce 25 films in 1992. However, 1991 saw net income drop by 23 percent and had no growth for the year, but saw the release of ''Beauty and the Beast'', winner of two Academy Awards and top-grossing film in the genre. Disney next moved into publishing with [[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]] and adult music with [[Hollywood Records]] while [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] was laying off 400 employees.<ref name=fu/> Disney also broadened its adult offerings in film when then-Disney Studio Chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] acquired [[Miramax|Miramax Films]] in 1993. That same year Disney created the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] team the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]], named after the [[The Mighty Ducks (film)|1992 hit film of the same name]]. Disney purchased a minority stake in the [[Los Angeles Angels|Anaheim Angels]] baseball team around the same time.<ref name=fu/>

Wells was killed in a helicopter crash in 1994.<ref name=fu/> Shortly thereafter, Katzenberg resigned and formed [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks SKG]] because Eisner would not appoint Katzenberg to Wells' now-available post (Katzenberg had also sued over the terms of his contract).<ref name=fu/> Instead, Eisner recruited his friend [[Michael Ovitz]], one of the founders of the [[Creative Artists Agency]], to be President, with minimal involvement from Disney's board of directors (which at the time included Oscar-winning actor [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Hilton Worldwide|Hilton Hotels Corporation]] CEO [[Stephen Bollenbach]], former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]], [[Yale School of Architecture|Yale]] dean [[Robert A. M. Stern]], and Eisner's predecessors [[Raymond Watson]] and [[Card Walker]]).

The Ovitz episode engendered a long-running [[derivative suit]], which finally concluded in June 2006, almost 10 years later. Chancellor [[William B.

In 1994, Eisner attempted to purchase [[NBC]] from [[General Electric]] (GE), but the deal failed due to GE wanting to keep 51 percent ownership of the network. On August 1, 1995, Disney announced they would acquire and merge with [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.]] for $19 billion, which at the time was the second largest corporate takeover. The merger would bring broadcast network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and its assets, including a 37.5% minority stake in [[A+E Networks|A&E Television Networks]], an 80 percent majority stake in [[ESPN]] and the Limited Partnership-ran [[DIC Productions]] into the Disney umbrella.<ref name=fu/> The deal was closed on February 10, 1996, and Eisner felt that the purchase of ABC was an important investment to keep Disney surviving and allowing it to compete with international multimedia conglomerates.<ref>{{cite interview |subject=Michael Eisner |url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/michael-eisner# |title=Michael Eisner |publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704123225/http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/michael-eisner |archive-date=July 4, 2014 |work=Archive of American Television |date=October 19–20, 2006}}</ref> Disney lost a $10.4 million lawsuit in September 1997 to Marsu B.V. over Disney's failure to produce as contracted 13 half-hour ''[[Marsupilami]]'' cartoon shows.

Disney, which had taken control of the Anaheim Angels in 1996, purchased a majority stake in the team in 1998. That same year, Disney began a move into the internet field with the purchase of [[Starwave]] and 43 percent of [[Infoseek]]. In 1999, Disney purchased the remaining shares of Infoseek and launched the [[Go.com|Go Network]] portal in January. Disney also launched its [[Disney Cruise Line|cruise line]] with the christening of ''[[Disney Magic]]'' and a sister ship, ''[[Disney Wonder]]''.<ref name=fu/> The Katzenberg case dragged on as his contract included a portion of the film revenue from ancillary markets forever.

Disney lawyers tried to indicate a decline situation which reveal some of the problems in the company. ABC had declining rating and increasing costs while the film segment had two film failures.

The year 2001 was one of cost-cutting, laying off 4,000 employees, Disney parks operations decreased, slashing annual live-action film investment, and minimizing Internet operations, mainly due to the [[September 11 attacks]], which led to a decline in vacation travel and the [[early 2000s recession]] led to a decrease in ABC revenue. While 2002 revenue had a small decrease from 2001 with the cost-cutting, net income rose to $1.2 billion with two creative film releases. In 2003, Disney became the first studio to record over $3 billion in worldwide box office receipts.<ref name=fu/> Eisner did not want the board to renominate [[Roy E.

On August 9, 2002, Disney said it was expressing great interest in buying [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] whose parent company [[Vivendi]] started a bidding war after inheriting $17.9 billion in debt by its purchase of the famed [[major film studio]] from [[Seagram]] for $34 billion.<ref name="GTG">{{Cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2002-08-09/news/0208090232_1_vivendi-disney-and-universal-theme-parks |title=Disney Might Make Play For Universal |last=Robert Johnson |date=August 9, 2002 |work=Orlando Sentinel |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720054213/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2002-08-09/news/0208090232_1_vivendi-disney-and-universal-theme-parks |archive-date=July 20, 2018}}</ref> In addition, [[Universal Orlando]]'s [[Islands of Adventure]] was struggling to deal with catastrophically low attendance since the park's opening in 1999, and the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 caused a dip of [[Universal Parks and Resorts]]' tourism attendance worldwide.
