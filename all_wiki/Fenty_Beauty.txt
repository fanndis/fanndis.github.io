'''Fenty Beauty''' (stylized as '''FEИTY BEAUTY''') is a [[cosmetics]] brand launched on September 8, 2017 by [[Rihanna]]. The brand is popular for its broad inclusivity across skin tones and gender, especially its Pro Filt'R [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]]. The original foundation launch included 40 shades, since expanded to 50. The inclusion of Fenty Beauty concealer includes 50 shades offering a wide variety to all skin types. The intent behind having so many shades to offer is to differentiate from other makeup companies that do not cater to a broad market. Fenty Beauty was named one of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine's best inventions of 2017.

== Background ==
In June 2014, Rihanna trademarked her surname, Fenty, for use on an array of products, leading to speculation that she would begin working on endeavors other than her music. Fenty Beauty was among these new trademarks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/rihanna-trademarks-her-name-9656814.html|title=Rihanna trademarks her name for use on a clothing empire|last=Sharkey|first=Linda|date=August 8, 2014|work=The Independent|access-date=April 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219101907/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/rihanna-trademarks-her-name-9656814.html|archive-date=February 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Rihanna has drawn some criticism for failing to cast [[transgender]] models in Fenty Beauty campaigns.<ref name=":8" /> In response she invoked a desire to avoid [[tokenism]] and respect privacy, saying she has <blockquote>"work[ed] with many gifted trans women throughout the years, but I don't go around doing trans castings! Just like I don't do straight non-trans women castings! I respect all women, and whether they're trans or not is none of my business! It's personal and some trans women are more comfortable being open about it than others so I have to respect that as a woman myself! I don't think it's fair that a trans woman, or man, be used as a convenient marketing tool!"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/rihanna-criticizes-brands-for-exploiting-trans-people|title=Rihanna Speaks Out Against Brands for Exploiting Trans People as 'a Convenient Marketing Tool'|last=Muller|first=Marissa G.|date=November 30, 2017|work=W Magazine|access-date=March 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328170147/https://www.wmagazine.com/story/rihanna-criticizes-brands-for-exploiting-trans-people|archive-date=March 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>
