The next song, "[[Disturbia (song)|Disturbia]]", follows with Rihanna taking off the blue dress and dancing around in a colorful daisy duke, leading into "[[Shut Up and Drive]]" where a car covered in graffiti is present in the middle of the stage. The first segment ends with "[[Man Down (song)|Man Down]]" where Rihanna gets inside the car and descends beneath the stage.

The second segment begins with a cover of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[Darling Nikki]]" where Rihanna, dressed in a suit and holding a cane, rubs against her female dancers. The song moves into "[[S&M (song)|S&M]]" where her female dancers remove her suit to reveal a tight black leotard and chain her to the stage. After a pillow fight with her male dancers, Rihanna then performs "Let Me", followed by "[[Skin (Rihanna song)|Skin]]" where Rihanna brings a fan onstage and gives him/her a [[lap dance]] as she descends back beneath the stage for a costume change.

The song then moves into a solo version of "[[Hate That I Love You]]" with Rihanna sitting in a chair next to the guitarist. The segment ends with "[[California King Bed]]" with smoke covering the stage floor, followed by another guitar solo by Bettencourt. The third and final interlude features a remix of "[[Pon de Replay]]" with images from Rihanna's music videos. "[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name]]" opens the final section with Rihanna wearing a colorful sequined bra and jean shorts, dancing with her dancers. The next song, "[[Rude Boy (Rihanna song)|Rude Boy]]", features Rihanna surrounded by her male dancers with various television screens in the background. Rihanna then puts on a pair of sunglasses and chants with the audience for "[[Cheers (Drink to That)]]", followed by "[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]" with vigorous choreography. Rihanna then performs "[[Take a Bow (Rihanna song)|Take a Bow]]" and says goodbye to the audience.

==Reception==

===Critical===
The tour has gained critical acclaim from music critics citing it as "Rihanna's best tour yet". Jane Stevenson of the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' commented that "the two-hour, larger-than-life show lived up to the billing. And then some."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/06/07/rihanna-is-loud-sexy-and-larger-than-life |title=Rihanna is loud, sexy and larger than life |publisher=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=June 7, 2011 |access-date=June 26, 2011}}</ref> Bernard Perusse of the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' stated that the tour was a visual spectacle saying, "Pods, dry ice, sparklers, plumes of smoke, a platform raising her from below stage and back down when needed, a moving section of the floor to convey her from one side of the stage to another, videos, writhing dancers, a cannon, arena-rock guitar solos, umpteen costume changes and maybe a record for the amount of times a performer has screamed 'Montreal!' in the centre. The fans ate it up."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/Rihanna+shows+Bell+Centre+concert+goers+that+brash+confidence+main+gift/4931630/story.html|title=Rihanna shows Bell Centre concert-goers that brash confidence is her main gift|publisher=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=June 11, 2011|access-date=June 26, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614142830/http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/Rihanna+shows+Bell+Centre+concert+goers+that+brash+confidence+main+gift/4931630/story.html|archive-date=June 14, 2011}}</ref> Jon Brean of the Minneapolis ''[[Star Tribune]]'' remarked, "The Barbadian singer is more visually and vocally dynamic than she has ever been before."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/music/124044434.html|title=Rihanna redefines Loud

''[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation News Barbados]]'' commented, "The name of Rihanna's world tour adequately described the experience at the biggest show to come to Barbados to date. It took a long time in coming, but Rihanna's first major showing in her hometown was definitely well worth the wait. From the endless hits including 'S&M', 'Man Down', 'Hard', 'Pon De Replay' and 'Unfaithful'; the spectacular stage and props to her playing a solo piece on drums, the girl who grew up in nearby Westbury Road was awesome."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/ri-ri-roars/|title=Ri-Ri roars|publisher=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)]]|date=August 6, 2011|access-date=August 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828170328/http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/ri-ri-roars/|archive-date=August 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

''[[Irish Independent]]'' concluded that, "Strutting across the stage surrounded by backing dancers, the 23-year-old seemed at home singing in Ireland. 14,000, mostly female, fans enjoyed the set which kicked off at 9.15pm when the singer emerged to thunderous sound effects and a {{sic|"blitzkreig"|expected=blitzkrieg}} of video from a silver shell wearing a luminous blue jacket."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/rihanna-is-in-a-field-of-her-own-with-sellout-show-in-dublinrsquos-o2-2894675.html|title=Rihanna is in a field of her own with sellout show in Dublin's O2
