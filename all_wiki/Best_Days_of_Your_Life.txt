==Content==
"Best Days of Your Life" is an up-tempo [[country pop]] song mostly backed by [[electric guitar]]. Its narrator tells about a former boyfriend who cheated on her and is going to get married and build a family with the lover. Although she wishes them to be happy and have a nice life, she says that he's already had the best days of his life with her (the narrator), and the new partner can never top it. She also feels sorry for his new girlfriend, because she has the concept that a cheater will always be a cheater, and while she is getting the prizes of her future, all the lover gets is the cheater boyfriend.

In an interview, Pickler has said that the circumstances portrayed in the song are based on a real-life experience that she herself went through. Pickler stated that she discovered her boyfriend cheating while she was on [[Brad Paisley]]'s ''Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour'' as an opening act alongside her friend and fellow country singer [[Taylor Swift]]. She told Swift about her boyfriend cheating and Swift had the idea of writing a song about the experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/story-behind-the-song-best-days-of-your-life-kellie-pickler/|title=Story Behind the Song: Kellie Pickler, 'Best Days of Your Life'|work=The Boot|publisher=[[Townsquare Media]]|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=April 4, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920042955/http://theboot.com/story-behind-the-song-best-days-of-your-life-kellie-pickler/|archivedate=September 20, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Pickler's former boyfriend [[Jordin Tootoo]] claimed in an interview with the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' and in his autobiography that Pickler's song was about their relationship.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/jordin-tootoo-writes-interesting-book-about-journey-to-nhl-and-battles-with-alcohol|title=Jordin Tootoo details journey to NHL and battles with alcohol in new biography|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|last=Hickey|first=Pat|date=October 31, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2018}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Kevin J. Coyne of Country Universe described the chorus as strong and compared it to the [[catchiness]] of [[Faith Hill]]'s "[[This Kiss (Faith Hill song)|This Kiss]]". But, he described the verses unfavorably: "Pickler sounds strained, there’s no discernible melody and the lyrics are no more memorable than the music backing them up."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryuniverse.net/2008/11/15/single-review-kellie-pickler-best-days-of-your-life/|title=Kellie Pickler, "Best Days of Your Life"|last=Coyne|first=Kevin J.|publisher=Country Universe|date=November 15, 2008|accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref> Jim Malec of The 9513 gave the song a thumbs down, saying that "[The song] isn’t funny, nor poignant, nor empowering. It is solely, and wholly, and unapologetically concerned only with expressing its fury. “Best Days of Your Life” is essentially four minutes of Pickler venting, unbridled and unartful."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the9513.com/kellie-pickler-best-days-of-your-life/|title=Kellie Pickler - "Best Days of Your Life"|last=Malec|first=Jim|publisher=The 9513|date=November 18, 2008|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331110033/http://www.the9513.com/kellie-pickler-best-days-of-your-life|archivedate=March 31, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>
