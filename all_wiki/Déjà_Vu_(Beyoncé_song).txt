"'''Déjà Vu'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]], featuring vocals by rapper [[Jay-Z]]. It was produced by [[Rodney Jerkins|Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]] and Beyoncé for her second solo album, ''[[B'Day (Beyoncé album)|B'Day]]'' (2006). "Déjà Vu" is an R&B song, which incorporates elements of the 1970s [[funk]] and [[soul music]]. Its music is largely based on live instrumentation, including [[bass guitar]], [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]], [[French horn|horns]], except [[Roland TR-808]] [[drum]] machine, which is a non-live instrument. The song's title and lyrics refer to a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover.

"Déjà Vu" was released as the album's [[lead single]] to US radio stations on June 24, 2006. The song received generally mixed critical reviews. Many critics noted the similarities of "Déjà Vu" with Beyoncé's own 2003 song "[[Crazy in Love]]". Critics commended the assertiveness and the sensuality with which Beyoncé sings the lyrics and compared her vocal delivery to that of [[Tina Turner]] in the late 1980s. "Déjà Vu" and its [[Freemasons (band)|Freemasons]] club remix version received three nominations at the [[49th Grammy Awards|2007 Grammy Awards]]. It was recognized as the Best Song of 2006 at the [[Music of Black Origin Awards|Music of Black Origin (MOBO) Awards]].

Commercially, "Déjà Vu" peaked at number four on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. It topped the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart, the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart, and the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. The song was [[RIAA certification|certified]] gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). "Déjà Vu" peaked at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and generally reached the top 20 in Europe. The song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Sophie Muller]]. About 5,000 fans [[online petition|petitioned online]] for a re-shoot of the video, complaining about, amongst other factors, the lack of theme, the wardrobe choice, and the seemingly sexual interactions between Beyoncé and Jay-Z.

In 2005, American record producer Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins and producer Jon Jon Traxx "came up with the concept of doing an old-school track, a throwback with real bass and horns", to which the song's title is partly attributed.<ref name="Jisi">{{cite web |last=Jisi |first=Chris |title=Jon Jon Webb's Complete Bass Line: Beyoncé's Déjà Vu |url=http://www.bassplayer.com/article/beyonces-deja-vu/dec-06/24360 |work=[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]] |publisher=[[NewBay Media]] |date=December 2006 |accessdate=January 23, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110072702/http://www.bassplayer.com/article/beyonces-deja-vu/dec-06/24360 |archivedate=November 10, 2007 }}</ref> Traxx with Jerkins, first recorded the [[Bass (instrument)|bass]] sections, onto which the [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], [[French horn|horns]] and vocals were layered.<ref name="Jisi"/> Production took place in Jerkins' [[New Jersey]]-based studio, and [[Sony Music Studios]] in [[New York City]].<ref name="Jisi"/>

Concerning the production of "Déjà Vu", Beyoncé told [[MTV News]]'':

<blockquote>
When I recorded 'Deja Vu' ... I knew that even before I started working on my album, I wanted to add live instruments to all of my songs. It's such a balance [of music on the song] [...] It's still young, still new and fresh, but it has the old soul groove. The energy is incredible. It's the summer anthem, I pray. I feel it. Rodney Jerkins is incredible, Jay of course is on it, he blessed the song, I'm happy with it.<ref name="mtvby">{{cite web |first=Shaheem |last=Reid |title=Beyonce Asks Women To Battle Over Her For Backing-Band Roles |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1534575/beyonce-wants-women-battle-over-her.jhtml |publisher=MTV News.

The title refers to the ''[[déjà vu]]'' phenomenon. The lyrics to "Déjà Vu" follow the [[Song structure (popular music)#Verse|verse]]–[[Song structure (popular music)#Pre-chorus|pre-chorus]]–[[song structure (popular music)#Chorus|chorus]] pattern, and feature two [[Rapping|rap verses]].<ref name="MusicSheet"/> It is [[hook (music)|hook]]-laden, similar in this respect to "Crazy in Love".<ref name="Smh"/> The lyrics detail a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover,<ref name="Jisi"/> shown in the lines, "Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?"<ref name="yorker"/> As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, [[slide (guitar technique)|slides]] into the main two-bar [[ostinato]].<ref name="Jisi"/> Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.<ref name="Jisi"/>

After that Beyoncé mentions Jay-Z, the bass glides up for a [[vibrato]]-rich fill, giving way to the first rap.<ref name="Jisi"/> Backgrounded with a repeating groove, Beyoncé starts the first verse. The pre-chorus follows, for which the bass changes to a more melodic tone "to play something more singing", in the words of Jon Jon Webb, the bass player on the track.<ref name="Jisi"/> The [[melody]] returns to the main groove during the repeated hook. This pattern repeats and leads to the second rap verse. The third pre-chorus "comes from Jerkins' idea to have the part changes on top, with Webb's main groove on the bottom".<ref name="Jisi"/> It is followed by the main pre-chorus, then the hook is repeated four times. After that, the singing stops and the instruments fill in the space of the pre-chorus. The hi-hat and Roland TR-808 also stop; the song ends with the plucked bass and blasts of horns from the very first line of the chorus.<ref name="Jisi"/>

Several other music critics have compared "Déjà Vu" to Beyoncé's 2003 single, "[[Crazy in Love]]", the lead single of her [[dangerously in Love|debut album]].

The video begins with showing Beyoncé against a green wall and Jay-Z sitting on a chair inside a dark room. Beyoncé and Jay-Z then start to simultaneously play imaginary instruments, mimicking the song's tune. Scenes of Beyoncé are then shown in several different rooms wearing different outfits. As the chorus begins, she is shown running around and dancing out in a large sugarcane field. At the end of the chorus, she dances in a red dress in front of a pond and in a large red dress out in front of a mansion. When Jay-Z's verse begins, the two are shown alone inside a room, Beyoncé is now barefoot and bare-legged, she dances seductively around Jay-Z, and leads to the controversial oral sex scene. Beyoncé is then shown wearing a green skirt and bedazzled bra while dancing around in sand. As the song progresses, she is shown dancing alone in a dark forest wearing a sparkling black dress as fireflies circle around her head. The song ends with Beyoncé leaning back in a pose as fireflies race away.

===Reception===
Reactions to the video were mixed. Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] commented it is "more thematic and thought provoking than the videos for '[[Baby Boy (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Baby Boy]]' and '[[Naughty Girl (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Naughty Girl]]'", Beyoncé's songs from her debut album, ''[[Dangerously in Love]]''.<ref name="slant"/> Allhiphop's Eb Haynes described the video "visually fresh" and "couture motivated".<ref name="Haynes"/> A news article published by ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' reported that a particular scene in the video is suggestive of [[oral sex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2006/07/26/scandal-of-the-day-beyonces-too-skanky-for-her-fans|title=Scandal of the Day: Beyoncé Too Skanky For Her Fans? |last=Goodman|first=Elizabeth|date=2006-07-26|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]|accessdate=February 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525090803/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2006/07/26/scandal-of-the-day-beyonces-too-skanky-for-her-fans |archivedate=May 25, 2009}}</ref> Natalie Y.
