==Personal background==
In 2010, Munsil was named as the 6th President in the 50-year history of [[Southwestern College (Arizona)|Southwestern College]] in Phoenix, Arizona. Munsil had been a member of the Board of Trustees for six years and an adjunct professor, teaching ethics, political science and pre-law courses at the College since 1994.<ref>http://arizonachristian.edu/president/biography/</ref>

In his first year as President, Munsil implemented a name change to Arizona Christian University, invited President [[George W. Bush]] to speak at the school's 50th anniversary, drawing 1,260 supporters and raising more than $1.5 million, and presided over the school's largest enrollment and largest freshman class in history.<ref>http://arizonachristian.edu/president/biography/</ref> Under his leadership, ACU raised its visibility, expanded its course offerings and majors, undertook campus renovations and building projects, dramatically increased fundraising and experienced large enrollment gains.  ACU seeks to attract students who will "transform culture with truth" – building biblical influence in every corner of society. In 2015 he wrote "Transforming Culture With Truth," explaining how ACU's Core Commitments reflect the biblical principles and values that built Western Civilization, and how young people committed to biblical truth are needed in leadership today. After four straight years of record enrollment, in 2017 Arizona Christian University was recognized for the first time in its history as a "Best College" by U.S. News & World Report, placing 16th among Best Regional Colleges in the 15-state Western region, and the highest-ranked university in its category in the state of Arizona.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/az</ref>

Munsil attended [[Arizona State University]] and was the editor of the university's newspaper, ''[[The State Press]]''.  Under Munsil the editorial direction of the paper became conservative—particularly toward faculty members viewed by Munsil and his student journalist colleagues as too leftist.<ref>[[Amy Silverman]], [http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1993-11-10/news/the-righteous-stuff/ "The Righteous Stuff"], ''Phoenix New Times'', November 10, 1993.</ref> Munsil was selected Outstanding Journalism Graduate of the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism/Telecommunications.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Trent Franks]], [[Rick Renzi]], and [[John Shadegg]].<ref>[http://www.lenmunsil.com/congressional_letter.pdf www.lenmunsil.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912083153/http://www.lenmunsil.com/congressional_letter.pdf |date=2006-09-12 }}</ref> He was also endorsed by Senator [[John McCain]] and more than 30 state legislators.<ref>Mike Sunnucks, [http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2006/09/04/daily22.html?jst=b_ln_hl "McCain backs Munsil for governor"], ''Phoenix Business Journal'', September 6, 2006.</ref>

Early polls suggested that Munsil had significant ground to make up in the primary, indicating in July that he had a mere 12% of Republican voters behind him.<ref>[http://www.brcpolls.com/06/RMP-2006-III-02.pdf "Rocky Mountain Poll"], Behavior research Center.</ref> [[Don Goldwater]], nephew of the late U.S. Senator and U.S. presidential candidate [[Barry Goldwater]], came in second in a four-way Republican Primary Election on Sept. 12th. Munsil received 51% of the vote, while Goldwater garnered 40%.  Mike Harris earned 6% and Gary Tupper mustered 4%.

In the general election, just 8 weeks later, Munsil was defeated by incumbent Governor [[Janet Napolitano]] by a 63% to 35% margin.
