===Howard Stern litigation===
In February 2006, Moonves led CBS to file a $500-million lawsuit against [[Howard Stern]] for allegedly breaching his contract by failing to disclose the details of his deal with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] while still employed by [[CBS Radio|Infinity Broadcasting]]. Stern vowed to fight the suit, and said on his radio program that Moonves and CBS were trying to "bully" him and his agent, Don Buchwald. Stern later appeared on CBS' own ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', wearing a shirt mocking Moonves and his wife. In June 2006, Stern announced that the lawsuit had been settled. As part of the settlement, Sirius acquired the exclusive rights to all of the [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]] tapes (over two decades' worth of shows) for $2 million.

On December 18, 2018, CBS announced that the board would deny Moonves his $120 million severance pay, as their investigation had found Moonves violated his contract. According to investigators, claims made by the women were credible, and led to more claims that were found to be credible during the course of the investigation. In addition, it was claimed that Moonves attempted to interfere with the investigation. Allegations of examples include Moonves refusing to cooperate with investigators, acting "evasive and untruthful" towards investigators, deleting hundreds of messages, and passing off his son's iPad as his own to investigators.<ref name="Screen Rant Severance Denied"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Izadi |first=Elahe |last2=Andrews |first2=Travis M. |date=December 17, 2018 |title= Former CBS chairman Les Moonves fired for cause, will not receive severance in wake of sexual misconduct allegations|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2018/12/17/former-cbs-chairman-les-moonves-fired-cause-will-not-receive-severance-wake-sexual-misconduct-allegations |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Punete |first=Maria |date=December 17, 2018 |title=CBS: Ex-CEO Les Moonves will be denied $120 million severance package |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/12/17/cbs-announces-les-moonves-denied-120-m-exit-package/2342128002/ |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Edmund |last2=Abrams |first2=Rachel |date=December 17, 2018 |title=CBS Says Les Moonves Will Not Receive $120 Million Severance |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/business/media/les-moonves-cbs-severance.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/17/media/cbs-ceo-les-moonves-no-severance/index.html |title=Ex-CBS chief Les Moonves will not get $120 million severance |last=Stelter |first=Brian |date=December 17, 2018 |website=[[CNN Business]] |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref>

On June 21, 2019, advice columnist [[E. Jean Carroll]] wrote in a first-person essay in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' that Moonves sexually assaulted her in an elevator in the mid-1990s after she interviewed him for a story. Moonves denied the allegation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2019/06/donald-trump-assault-e-jean-carroll-other-hideous-men.html|title=Donald Trump Assaulted Me, But He’s Not Alone on My List of Hideous Men|last=Carroll|first=E.

===Moon Rise Unlimited===
On February 8, 2019, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Moonves had founded his own company in [[West Hollywood, California]] named Moon Rise Unlimited after being fired from CBS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/business/media/les-moonves-moonrise.html|title=Les Moonves, Fired by CBS, Sets Up Shop in Hollywood|website=[[The New York Times]]|author=David Gelles, Rachel Abrams and Edmund Lee|date=February 8, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2020}}</ref>

==Public appearances==
On April 7, 2003, Moonves portrayed himself in an episode of ''[[The Practice]]''. From early 2004 until its end in May 2015, Moonves made regular appearances on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. One of these came when [[David Letterman|Letterman]] declared outrage that CBS featured his late-night competitor [[Jay Leno]] in an ad for CBS's telecast of the [[People's Choice Awards]]. Letterman jokingly warned the "CBS stooge in the control room" to call his buddies "before things turn ugly"; Moonves obliged. Later appearances took the same format, with Letterman discussing current events and the CBS network with the company's CEO.

On the March 23, 2015, premiere episode of ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]'', Moonves portrayed himself as the head of CBS who sends out a golden ticket granting whoever finds it a chance to host ''The Late Late Show'', in an homage to ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. Moonves also appeared on the September 8, 2015, premiere of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', operating a large switch he could use to switch back to [[CBS Summer Showcase|reruns]] of ''[[The Mentalist]]'' if he was unhappy with the new program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4026215/stephen-colbert-les-moonves/|title=Watch Stephen Colbert Joke With CEO of CBS About Canceling His Show|first=Justin|last=Worland|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time.com]]|date=September 9, 2015|access-date=September 9, 2015}}</ref>
