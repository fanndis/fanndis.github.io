==History==
{{Further|Timeline of the BBC}}

===The birth of British broadcasting, 1920 to 1922===
Britain's first live public broadcast was made from the factory of [[Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company]] in [[Chelmsford]] in June 1920. It was sponsored by the ''[[Daily Mail]]''{{'}}s [[Lord Northcliffe]] and featured the famous Australian soprano [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]]. The Melba broadcast caught the people's imagination and marked a turning point in the British public's attitude to radio.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''BBC'' p. 47</ref>  However, this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications. By late 1920, pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority, the [[General Post Office]] (GPO), was sufficient to lead to a ban on further Chelmsford broadcasts.<ref>Asa Briggs, p. 50</ref>

But by 1922, the GPO had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests<ref>Curran and [[Jean Seaton]], ''[[Power Without Responsibility]]'', (Routledge) p. 110</ref> and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members.<ref>Asa Briggs, pp. 50, 97</ref> Anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the United States, the GPO proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufacturers, to be known as the [[British Broadcasting Company|British Broadcasting Company Ltd.]] [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], a Scottish Calvinist, was appointed its General Manager in December 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast.<ref>supra Curran and Seaton, p. 110</ref> [[L. Stanton Jefferies]] was its first Director of Music.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Doctor |first1=Jennifer Ruth |title=The BBC and Ultra-Modern Music, 1922–1936: Shaping a Nation's Tastes |year=1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVCtkShvDSkC |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521661171 |page=402 |access-date=8 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811180433/http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CVCtkShvDSkC |archive-date=11 August 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The company was to be financed by a royalty on the sale of BBC wireless receiving sets from approved domestic manufacturers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The BBC: Public Institution and Private World|last=Burns|first=Tom|publisher=The Macmillan Press LTD|year=1977|isbn=978-0-333-19720-2|location=Great Britain|pages=1}}</ref> To this day, the BBC aims to follow the Reithian directive to "inform, educate and entertain".<ref>{{cite news|title=No need to change BBC's mission to 'inform, educate and entertain'|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/communications-committee/news-parliament-2015/bbc-charter-review-report-published/|agency=UK Parliament|date=31 October 2016|access-date=31 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031154543/https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/communications-committee/news-parliament-2015/bbc-charter-review-report-published/|archive-date=31 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

===From private company towards public service corporation, 1923 to 1926===
The financial arrangements soon proved inadequate. Set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets.<ref>supra Asa Briggs, p. 146</ref> By mid-1923, discussions between the GPO and the BBC had become deadlocked and the Postmaster-General commissioned a review of broadcasting by the [[Sykes Committee]]. The Committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the BBC's immediate financial distress, and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the GPO. This was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufacturers' protection expired. The BBC's broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence, as was the prohibition on advertising. The BBC was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 19:00 and was required to source all news from external wire services.

Mid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration, this time by the Crawford committee.  By now, the BBC, under Reith's leadership, had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified (monopoly) broadcasting service, but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion. Wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with Reith keen that the BBC be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise. The recommendations of the Crawford Committee were published in March the following year and were still under consideration by the GPO when the [[1926 general strike]] broke out in May. The strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production, and with restrictions on news bulletins waived, the BBC suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis.<ref name="supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117">supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117</ref>

The crisis placed the BBC in a delicate position. On one hand Reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the BBC at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the BBC were to step out of line, but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently. The government was divided on how to handle the BBC but ended up trusting Reith, whose opposition to the strike mirrored the PM's own. Although [[Winston Churchill]] in particular wanted to commander the BBC to use it "to the best possible advantage", Reith wrote that [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s government wanted to be able to say "that they did not commandeer [the BBC], but they know that they can trust us not to be really impartial".<ref name="guardian180814">{{cite web |last1=Higgins |first1=Charlotte |title=BBC's long struggle to present the facts without fear or favour |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/18/-sp-bbc-report-facts-impartial |website=The Guardian |access-date=19 May 2020 |date=18 August 2014}}</ref> Thus the BBC was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government's objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing. The resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the PM had broadcast to the nation from Reith's home, using one of Reith's sound bites inserted at the last moment, or that the BBC had banned broadcasts from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and delayed a peace appeal by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Supporters of the strike nicknamed the BBC the BFC for British Falsehood Company. Reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from Blake's "[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]" signifying that England had been saved.<ref>Crook, Tim (2002). "International Radio Journalism". Routledge.</ref>

While the BBC tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers, [[Jean Seaton]], Professor of Media History and the Official BBC Historian, has characterised the episode as the invention of "modern propaganda in its British form".<ref name="supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117"/> Reith argued that trust gained by 'authentic impartial news' could then be used. Impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself.<ref>supra Curran and Seaton, p. 118</ref>

The BBC did well out of the crisis, which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting, and it was followed by the Government's acceptance of the recommendation made by the Crawford Committee (1925–26) that the British Broadcasting Company be replaced by a non-commercial, Crown-chartered organisation: the British Broadcasting Corporation.

The British Broadcasting Corporation came into existence on 1 January 1927, and Reith – newly knighted – was appointed its first Director General. To represent its purpose and (stated) values, the new corporation adopted the [[Coat of arms of the BBC|coat of arms]], including the motto "Nation shall speak peace unto Nation".<ref name="Motto">{{cite book |editor-last=Knowles |editor-first=Elizabeth |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations |url=https://archive.org/details/oxforddictionary0000unse_f8b0 |edition=Oxford Reference Online |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=11 February 2010 |isbn=9780199208951 }}</ref>

British radio audiences had little choice apart from the upscale programming of the BBC. Reith, an intensely moralistic executive, was in full charge. His goal was to broadcast "All that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement.... The preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance."<ref>[[Charles Mowat]], ''Britain between the Wars 1918–1940'' (1955) p 242.</ref> Reith succeeded in building a high wall against an American-style free-for-all in radio in which the goal was to attract the largest audiences and thereby secure the greatest advertising revenue. There was no paid advertising on the BBC; all the revenue came from a tax on receiving sets. Highbrow audiences, however, greatly enjoyed it.<ref>David Hendy, "Painting with Sound: The Kaleidoscopic World of Lance Sieveking, a British Radio Modernist," ''Twentieth Century British History'' (2013) 24#2 pp 169–200.</ref>  At a time when American, Australian and Canadian stations were drawing huge audiences cheering for their local teams with the broadcast of baseball, rugby and hockey, the BBC emphasised service for a national, rather than a regional audience. Boat races were well covered along with tennis and horse racing, but the BBC was reluctant to spend its severely limited air time on long football or cricket games, regardless of their popularity.<ref>Mike Huggins,  "BBC Radio and Sport 1922–39," ''Contemporary British History'' (2007) 21#4 pp 491–515.</ref>

[[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]] and the BBC, with support from [[the Crown]], determined the universal needs of the people of Britain and broadcast content according to these perceived standards.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The BBC and national identity in Britain, 1922–53|last=Hajkowski|first=Thomas|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=9780719079443|location=New York, New York|pages=11}}</ref> Reith effectively censored anything that he felt would be harmful, directly or indirectly.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|title=Radio Modernism|last=Avery|first=Todd|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|year=2006|isbn=9780754655176|pages=21}}</ref> While recounting his time with the BBC in 1935, [[Raymond Postgate]] claims that BBC broadcasters were made to submit a draft of their potential broadcast for approval.

====BBC versus other media====

The success of broadcasting provoked animosities between the BBC and well established media such as theatres, concert halls and the recording industry. By 1929, the BBC complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting, because they feared it harmed the artist "by making his material stale" and that it "reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer". On the other hand, the BBC was "keenly interested" in a cooperation with the recording companies who "in recent years&nbsp;... have not been slow to make records of singers, orchestras, dance bands, etc. who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless." Radio plays were so popular that the BBC had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting: "Day in and day out, manuscripts come in, and nearly all go out again through the post, with a note saying 'We regret, etc.'"<ref>''BBC Hand Book'' (1929), pp. 164, 182, 186</ref> In the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity, for example the friendly and wide-ranging organ broadcasts at St George's Hall, Langham Place, by [[Reginald Foort]], who held the official role of BBC Staff Theatre Organist from 1936 to 1938; Foort continued to work for the BBC as a freelance into the 1940s and enjoyed a nationwide following.

Television broadcasting was suspended from 1 September 1939 to 7 June 1946, during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and it was left to [[BBC Radio]] broadcasters such as [[Reginald Foort]] to keep the nation's spirits up. The BBC moved much of its radio operations out of London, initially to Bristol, and then to Bedford.  Concerts were broadcast from the Corn Exchange; the Trinity Chapel in [[St Paul's Church, Bedford]] was the studio for the daily service from 1941 to 1945, and, in the darkest days of the war in 1941, the [[Cosmo Gordon Lang|Archbishops of Canterbury]] and [[William Temple (bishop)|York]] came to St Paul's to broadcast to the UK and all parts of the world on the National Day of Prayer. BBC employees during the war included [[George Orwell]] who spent two years with the broadcaster.<ref name="Orwell"/>

During his role as Prime Minister during the Second World War, [[Winston Churchill]] would deliver 33 major wartime speeches by radio, all of which were carried by the BBC within the UK.<ref>Christopher H. Sterling (2004). "Encyclopedia of Radio 3-Volume Set". p. 524. Routledge</ref> On 18 June 1940, French general [[Charles de Gaulle]], in exile in London as the leader of the Free French, made a speech, broadcast by the BBC, urging the French people not to capitulate to the Nazis.<ref>{{cite news|title=How de Gaulle speech changed fate of France|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8747121.stm|agency=BBC|date=4 January 2018|access-date=4 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831091459/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8747121.stm|archive-date=31 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1938, John Reith and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]], specifically the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] which had been set up for WWII, designed a censorship apparatus for the inevitability of war.<ref name=":43">{{Cite book|title=The Echo of War|last=Nicholas|first=Sian|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0719046087|location=New York, New York|pages=18}}</ref> Due to the BBC's advancements in [[shortwave radio]] technology, the corporation could broadcast across the world during World War II.<ref name=":52">{{Cite book|title=Selling War: The British Propaganda Campaign Against American "neutrality" in World War II|last=Cull|first=Nicholas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0195111507|location=New York, New York|pages=42}}</ref> Within Europe, the BBC European Service would gather intelligence and information regarding the current events of the war in English.<ref name=":43"/><ref name=":62">{{Cite book|title=BBC Broadcasts to Portugal in World War II|last=Ribeiro|first=Nelson|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|year=2011|isbn=9780773414877|location=Lewiston, New York|pages=63}}</ref> Regional BBC workers, based on their regional geo-political climate, would then further censor the material their broadcasts would cover. Nothing was to be added outside of the preordained news items.<ref name=":43"/><ref name=":62"/> For example, the BBC Polish Service was heavily censored due to fears of jeopardising relations with the [[Soviet Union]].

This material also passed through the BBC's censorship office, which surveilled and edited American coverage of British affairs.<ref name=":52"/> By 1940, across all BBC broadcasts, music by composers from enemy nations was censored.

Competition to the BBC was introduced in 1955, with the commercial and independently operated television network of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. However, the BBC monopoly on radio services would persist until 8 October 1973 when under the control of the newly renamed [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA), the UK's first Independent local radio station, [[LBC]] came on-air in the London area. As a result of the [[Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting|Pilkington Committee]] report of 1962, in which the BBC was praised for the quality and range of its output, and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming,<ref>{{cite web|title=Committees of Enquiry: Pilkington Committee |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/heritage/more/pdfs/committees_of_enquiry.pdf |page=4 |date=1 June 1962 |access-date=30 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012060952/http://www.bbc.co.uk/heritage/more/pdfs/committees_of_enquiry.pdf |archive-date=12 October 2006 |url-status=live  }}</ref> the decision was taken to award the BBC a second television channel, [[BBC Two|BBC2]], in 1964, renaming the existing service [[BBC1]]. BBC2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across Europe. BBC2 was broadcast in colour from 1 July 1967, and was joined by BBC1 and ITV on 15 November 1969. The 405 line [[Vhf#United Kingdom|VHF]] transmissions of BBC1 (and ITV) were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985.

Starting in 1964, a series of [[pirate radio]] stations (starting with [[Radio Caroline]]) came on the air and forced the British government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally based advertising-financed services. In response, the BBC reorganised and renamed their radio channels. On 30 September 1967, the Light Programme was split into [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] offering continuous "Popular" music and [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] more "Easy Listening".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/27/bvradio127.xml&page=1 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=The day we woke up to pop music on Radio 1 |date=27 September 2007 |first=Imogen |last=Carter |access-date=30 September 2007 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018203739/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2007%2F09%2F27%2Fbvradio127.xml&page=1 |archive-date=18 October 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The "Third" programme became [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] offering classical music and cultural programming.

In 1974, the BBC's [[teletext]] service, [[Ceefax]], was introduced, created initially to provide subtitling, but developed into a news and information service. In 1978, BBC staff went on strike just before the Christmas of that year, thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one.<ref>[http://www.meldrum.co.uk/mhp/continuity/guestroom.html The Guestroom for Mr Cock-up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224233404/http://www.meldrum.co.uk/mhp/continuity/guestroom.html |date=24 February 2008 }} Pick of the Continuity Announcers, 6 April 2000</ref><ref>[http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/itw/features/Ratings.html Ratings for 1978] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827202157/http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/itw/features/Ratings.html |date=27 August 2008 }} Independent Teleweb</ref> Since the deregulation of the UK television and radio market in the 1980s, the BBC has faced increased competition from the commercial sector (and from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster [[Channel 4]]), especially on satellite television, cable television, and [[digital television]] services. In the late 1980s, the BBC began a process of [[divestment]] by [[Corporate spin-off|spinning off]] and selling parts of its organisation. In 1988, it sold off the [[Hulton Press Library]], a photographic archive which had been acquired from the ''[[Picture Post]]'' magazine by the BBC in 1957. The archive was sold to Brian Deutsch and is now owned by [[Getty Images]].<ref name=hulton-history>{{cite web|last=McDonald|first=Sarah|title=15 October 2004 © Sarah McDonald, Curator Page 1 10/15/04 Hulton{{!}}Archive – History In Pictures|url=http://corporate.gettyimages.com/masters2/conservation/articles/HAHistory.pdf|publisher=Getty Images|access-date=28 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527044717/http://corporate.gettyimages.com/masters2/conservation/articles/HAHistory.pdf|archive-date=27 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  During the 1990s, this process continued with the separation of certain operational arms of the corporation into autonomous but [[subsidiary|wholly owned subsidiaries]] of the BBC, with the aim of generating additional revenue for programme-making.

The [[BBC Research Department]] has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques.  The BBC was also responsible for the development of the [[NICAM]] stereo standard. In recent decades, a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched: [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|Radio 5]] was launched in 1990, as a sports and educational station, but was replaced in 1994, with [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]] to become a live radio station, following the success of the [[BBC Radio 4 News FM|Radio 4 service]] to cover the 1991 Gulf War. The new station would be a news and sport station. In 1997, [[BBC News 24]], a rolling news channel, launched on [[digital television]] services and the following year, [[BBC Choice]] launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC. The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel, which was renamed [[BBC Parliament]]. In 1999, [[BBC Knowledge]] launched as a multi media channel, with services available on the newly launched [[BBC Red Button|BBC Text]] digital teletext service, and on [[BBC Online]]. The channel had an educational aim, which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries.

===2000 to 2011===
In 2002, several television and radio channels were reorganised. [[BBC Knowledge]] was replaced by [[BBC Four]] and became the BBC's arts and documentaries channel. [[CBBC]], which had been a programming strand as Children's BBC since 1985, was split into CBBC and [[CBeebies]], for younger children, with both new services getting a digital channel: the [[CBBC Channel]] and [[CBeebies]] Channel. In addition to the television channels, new digital radio stations were created: [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]], [[BBC Radio 6 Music|6 Music]] and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]]. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|BBC 1Xtra]] was a sister station to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] and specialised in modern black music, [[BBC Radio 6 Music|BBC 6 Music]] specialised in alternative music genres and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]] specialised in archive, speech and children's programming.

[[File:Manchester big screen.jpg|thumb|left|England fans in [[Manchester]] during a [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] game shown on the [[BBC Big Screen]]]]
The following few years resulted in repositioning of some of the channels to conform to a larger brand: in 2003, [[BBC Choice]] was replaced by [[BBC Three]], with programming for younger adults and shocking real life documentaries, BBC News 24 became the [[BBC News Channel]] in 2008, and BBC Radio 7 became [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] in 2011, with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]. In 2008, another channel was launched, [[BBC Alba]], a [[Scottish Gaelic]] service.

The 2004 [[Hutton Inquiry]] and the subsequent Report raised questions about the BBC's journalistic standards and its impartiality. This led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then Director General, [[Greg Dyke]].

Unlike the other departments of the BBC, the BBC World Service was funded by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, more commonly known as the Foreign Office or the FCO, is the British government department responsible for promoting the interests of the United Kingdom abroad.

In 2006, [[BBC HD]] launched as an experimental service, and became official in December 2007. The channel broadcast HD simulcasts of programmes on [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[BBC Three]] and [[BBC Four]] as well as repeats of some older programmes in HD. In 2010, an HD simulcast of BBC One launched: [[BBC One HD]]. The  channel uses HD versions of BBC One's schedule and uses upscaled versions of programmes not currently produced in HD. The BBC HD channel closed in March 2013 and was replaced by BBC2 HD in the same month.

On 18 October 2007, BBC Director General Mark Thompson announced a controversial plan to make major cuts and reduce the size of the BBC as an organisation. The plans included a reduction in posts of 2,500; including 1,800 redundancies, consolidating news operations, reducing programming output by 10% and selling off the flagship [[BBC Television Centre|Television Centre]] building in London.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/10_october/18/reform.shtml|title=Radical reform to deliver a more focused BBC|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=18 October 2007|access-date=18 October 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071020051207/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/10_october/18/reform.shtml| archive-date= 20 October 2007 | url-status=live}}</ref> These plans have been fiercely opposed by unions, who have threatened a series of strikes; however, the BBC have stated that the cuts are essential to move the organisation forward and concentrate on increasing the quality of programming.

On 20 October 2010, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] announced that the television licence fee would be frozen at its current level until the end of the current charter in 2016. The same announcement revealed that the BBC would take on the full cost of running the [[BBC World Service]] and the [[BBC Monitoring]] service from the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], and partially finance the Welsh broadcaster [[S4C]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Television licence fee to be frozen for the next six years|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11572171|access-date=6 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007165009/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11572171|archive-date=7 October 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Further cuts were announced on 6 October 2011, so the BBC could reach a total reduction in their budget of 20%, following the licence fee freeze in October 2010, which included cutting staff by 2,000 and sending a further 1,000 to the [[MediaCityUK]] development in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], with BBC Three moving online only in 2016, the sharing of more programmes between stations and channels, sharing of radio news bulletins, more repeats in schedules, including the whole of BBC Two daytime and for some original programming to be reduced. [[BBC HD]] was closed on 26 March 2013, and replaced with an HD simulcast of BBC Two; however, flagship programmes, other channels and full funding for [[CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] would be retained.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC set to cut 2000 jobs by 2017|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15165926|access-date=6 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=6 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006124012/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15165926|archive-date=6 October 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=BBC cuts at a glance|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15186116|access-date=6 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=6 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006172317/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15186116|archive-date=6 October 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=BBC cuts: in detail|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8810868/BBC-cuts-in-detail.html|access-date=6 October 2011|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=6 October 2011|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006131137/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8810868/BBC-cuts-in-detail.html|archive-date=6 October 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Numerous BBC facilities have been sold off, including [[New Broadcasting House (Manchester)|New Broadcasting House]] on [[Oxford Road, Manchester|Oxford Road]] in Manchester.

Under the new royal charter instituted 2017, the corporation must publish an annual report to Ofcom, outlining its plans and public service obligations for the next year. In its 2017–18 report, released July 2017, the BBC announced plans to "re-invent" its output to better compete against commercial streaming services such as [[Netflix]]. These plans included increasing the diversity of its content on television and radio, a major increase in investments towards digital children's content, and plans to make larger investments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to "rise to the challenge of better reflecting and representing a changing UK."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40489812|title=BBC making £34m investment in children's services|date=4 July 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=7 July 2017|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707051117/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40489812|archive-date=7 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jul/04/bbc-promises-wider-mix-than-rivals-seeks-reinvent-itself|title=BBC promises a wider mix than rivals as it seeks to reinvent itself|last=Ruddick|first=Graham|date=4 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=7 July 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707003420/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jul/04/bbc-promises-wider-mix-than-rivals-seeks-reinvent-itself|archive-date=7 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===MI5 vetting policy===
From as early as the 1930s until the 1990s, [[MI5]], the British domestic intelligence service, engaged in [[vetting]] of applicants for BBC positions, a policy designed to keep out persons deemed subversive.<ref name="vetting">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43754737 |website=bbc.co.uk |title=The vetting files: How the BBC kept out 'subversives' |date=22 April 2018 |access-date=22 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422000203/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43754737 |archive-date=22 April 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1522875/Revealed-how-the-BBC-used-MI5-to-vet-thousands-of-staff.html |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |title=Revealed: how the BBC used MI5 to vet thousands of staff |date=2 July 2006 |access-date=22 April 2018 |last1=Hastings |first1=Chris |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426100703/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1522875/Revealed-how-the-BBC-used-MI5-to-vet-thousands-of-staff.html |archive-date=26 April 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1933, BBC executive Colonel Alan Dawnay began to meet with the head of MI5, Sir [[Vernon Kell]], to informally trade information; from 1935, a formal arrangement was made wherein job applicants would be secretly vetted by MI5 for their political views (without their knowledge).<ref name="vetting"/> The BBC took up a policy of denying any suggestion of such a relationship by the press (the existence of MI5 itself was not officially acknowledged until the [[Security Service Act 1989]].<ref name="vetting"/>

This relationship garnered wider public attention after an article by [[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]] and Paul Lashmar appeared in ''[[The Observer]]'' in August 1985, revealing that MI5 had been vetting appointments, running operations out of Room 105 in [[Broadcasting House]].<ref name="vetting"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/mi5.bbc.page9_obs_18aug1985.html |newspaper=The Observer |title=The Blaclist in Room 105 |date=18 August 1985 |access-date=22 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513210628/http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/mi5.bbc.page9_obs_18aug1985.html |archive-date=13 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the time of the exposé, the operation was being run by [[Ronnie Stonham]]. A memo from 1984 revealed that blacklisted organisations included the far-left [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]], the [[Workers Revolutionary Party (UK)|Workers Revolutionary Party]] and the [[Militant Tendency]], as well as the far-right [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] and the [[British National Party]]. An association with one of these groups could result in a denial of a job application.<ref name="vetting"/>

In October 1985, the BBC announced that it would stop the vetting process, except for a few people in top roles, as well as those in charge of [[Wartime Broadcasting Service]] emergency broadcasting (in event of a [[nuclear war]]) and staff in the [[BBC World Service]].<ref name="vetting"/> In 1990, following the Security Service Act 1989, vetting was further restricted to only those responsible for wartime broadcasting and those with access to [[Security clearance|secret government information]].<ref name="vetting"/> Michael Hodder, who succeeded Stonham, had the MI5 vetting files sent to the [[BBC Information and Archives]] in [[Reading, Berkshire]].<ref name="vetting"/>

===Revenue===

The principal means of funding the BBC is through the television licence, costing £154.50 per year per household since April 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/faqs/FAQ23|title=How much does a TV Licence cost? – TV Licensing ™|website=www.tvlicensing.co.uk|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717184925/https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/faqs/FAQ23|archive-date=17 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Such a licence is required to legally receive broadcast television across the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. No licence is required to own a television used for other means, or for sound only radio sets (though a separate licence for these was also required for non-TV households until 1971). The cost of a television licence is set by the government and enforced by the criminal law. A discount is available for households with only black-and-white television sets. A 50% discount is also offered to people who are registered blind or severely visually impaired,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/for-your-home/blindseverely-sight-impaired-aud5|title=Blind/severely sight impaired|publisher=TV Licensing|date=1 April 2000|access-date=15 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122104842/http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/for-your-home/blindseverely-sight-impaired-aud5|archive-date=22 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> and the licence is completely free for any household containing anyone aged 75 or over. However, from August 2020, the licence fee will only be waived if over 75 and receiving pension credit.<ref name="TV Licensing Over 75 TV Licences">{{cite web |url=https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/age?wt.mc_id=bbc_pr_o75_english |title=Important information about over 75 TV Licences |publisher=TV Licensing |access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref>

The BBC pursues its licence fee collection and enforcement under the trading name "TV Licensing". The revenue is collected privately by Capita, an outside agency, and is paid into the central government [[Consolidated Fund]], a process defined in the [[Communications Act 2003]]. Funds are then allocated by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Treasury and approved by Parliament via legislation. Additional revenues are paid by the Department for Work and Pensions to compensate for subsidised licences for eligible over-75-year-olds.

The licence fee is classified as a tax,<ref name="Select Committee 20060303">{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldbbc/128/128i.pdf |title=Further Issues for BBC Charter Review |access-date=15 August 2008 |website=House of Lords Session Report |publisher=The Stationery Office Limited |date=3 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320052437/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldbbc/128/128i.pdf |archive-date=20 March 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> and its evasion is a criminal offence.

Income from commercial enterprises and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes has substantially increased over recent years,<ref>{{cite web | title = Annual Report and Accounts 2004–2005 | url = http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/2004-05/bbc_2004_05.pdf | author = BBC | page = 94 | access-date = 16 May 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120119172042/http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/2004-05/bbc_2004_05.pdf | archive-date = 19 January 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref> with [[BBC Worldwide]] contributing some £243&nbsp;million to the BBC's core public service business.<ref name="BBC Annual Report 2018/19" />

* £3.690&nbsp;billion in licence fees collected from householders;
* £1.199&nbsp;billion from the BBC's commercial businesses and government grants some of which will cease in 2020

The licence fee has, however, attracted criticism. It has been argued that in an age of multi-stream, multi-channel availability, an obligation to pay a licence fee is no longer appropriate. The BBC's use of private sector company [[Capita Group]] to send letters to premises not paying the licence fee has been criticised, especially as there have been cases where such letters have been sent to premises which are up to date with their payments, or do not require a TV licence.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/09/22/ftlicence22.xml | title = Why am I being hounded like this? | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 22 September 2006 | access-date = 6 February 2008 | location = London | first = Simon | last = Heffer | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071117105208/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2006%2F09%2F22%2Fftlicence22.xml | archive-date = 17 November 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref>

The BBC uses advertising campaigns to inform customers of the requirement to pay the licence fee. Past campaigns have been criticised by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Boris Johnson]] and former MP [[Ann Widdecombe]] for having a threatening nature and language used to scare evaders into paying.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2005/05/26/do2602.xml | title = I won't pay to be abused by the BBC | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 26 May 2005 | access-date = 6 February 2008 | location = London | first = Boris | last = Johnson | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070815114952/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fopinion%2F2005%2F05%2F26%2Fdo2602.xml | archive-date = 15 August 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/24455/BBC-bullies-shame-in-licence-fee-chaos | title = BBC bullies' shame in licence fee chaos | newspaper = [[The Daily Express]] | location = UK | date = 7 November 2007 | access-date = 6 February 2008 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120724095358/http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/24455/BBC-bullies-shame-in-licence-fee-chaos | archive-date = 24 July 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref> Audio clips and television broadcasts are used to inform listeners of the BBC's comprehensive database.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/index.jsp | title = TV Licensing | publisher=[[TV Licensing]] | date =  2 June 2008 | access-date =6 February 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080207185717/http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/index.jsp| archive-date= 7 February 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref> There are a number of pressure groups campaigning on the issue of the licence fee.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.spiderbomb.com/tv/ | title = Example of Licence Fee pressure group | publisher=Campaign to Abolish the Licence Fee | date =  2 June 2008 | access-date =6 February 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080220031124/http://www.spiderbomb.com/tv/| archive-date= 20 February 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>

The majority of the BBC's commercial output comes from its commercial arm [[BBC Worldwide]] who sell programmes abroad and exploit key brands for merchandise. Of their 2012/13 sales, 27% were centred on the five key "superbrands" of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' (known as ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' internationally), the BBC's archive of natural history programming (collected under the umbrella of [[BBC Earth]]) and the (now sold) travel guide brand [[Lonely Planet]].<ref name="BBC Worldwide 2012/13 review">{{cite web|title=Annual Review 2012/13|url=http://www.bbcworldwide.com/media/94807/bbc%20worldwide%20annual%20review%202012-13.pdf|publisher=BBC Worldwide|access-date=17 August 2013|page=34|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820040453/http://www.bbcworldwide.com/media/94807/bbc%20worldwide%20annual%20review%202012-13.pdf|archive-date=20 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Broadcasting House by Stephen Craven.jpg|thumb|upright|The headquarters of the BBC at [[Broadcasting House]] in [[Portland Place]], London. This section of the building is called ''Old Broadcasting House''.]]

[[Broadcasting House]] in [[Portland Place]], London, is the official headquarters of the BBC. It is home to six of the ten BBC national radio networks, BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 1xtra, BBC Asian Network, [[BBC Radio 3]], [[BBC Radio 4]], and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]]. It is also the home of [[BBC News]], which relocated to the building from [[BBC Television Centre]] in 2013. On the front of the building are statues of [[Prospero]] and [[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]], characters from [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]'', sculpted by [[Eric Gill]]. Renovation of Broadcasting House began in 2002, and was completed in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC Broadcasting House extension – review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/04/broadcasting-house-bbc-extension-moore |access-date=10 June 2020 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

Until it closed at the end of March 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/bbc-television-centre-closes-its-doors-for-the-last-time-8555435.html|title=BBC Television Centre closes its doors for the last time|website=The Evening Standard|access-date=23 December 2015|date=31 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125083316/http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/bbc-television-centre-closes-its-doors-for-the-last-time-8555435.html|archive-date=25 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[BBC Television]] was based at BBC Television Centre, a purpose built television facility and the second built in the country located in [[White City, London]]. This facility has been host to a number of famous guests and programmes through the years, and its name and image is familiar with many British citizens. Nearby, the [[BBC White City]] complex contains numerous programme offices, housed in Centre House, the Media Centre and Broadcast Centre. It is in this area around [[Shepherd's Bush]] that the majority of BBC employees work.

As part of a major reorganisation of BBC property, the entire BBC News operation relocated from the News Centre at BBC Television Centre to the refurbished Broadcasting House to create what is being described as "one of the world's largest live broadcast centres".<ref>{{cite web | title = New Broadcasting House – The future | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/thefuture/bh_project.shtml | author=BBC | access-date =6 July 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060521230740/http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/thefuture/bh_project.shtml| archive-date= 21 May 2006 | url-status=live}}</ref> The [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News Channel]] and [[BBC World News]] relocated to the premises in early 2013.<ref>{{cite web | title = BBC News' television output moves to new studios at Broadcasting House | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/tv_news_move.html | author = BBC | access-date = 23 December 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190505071444/https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/tv_news_move.html | archive-date = 5 May 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> Broadcasting House is now also home to most of the BBC's national radio stations, and the [[BBC World Service]].

In addition to the scheme above, the BBC is in the process of making and producing more programmes outside London, involving production centres such as [[BBC Northern Ireland|Belfast]], [[BBC Cymru Wales|Cardiff]], [[BBC Scotland|Glasgow]], Newcastle and, most notably, in [[Greater Manchester]] as part of the "BBC North Project" scheme where several major departments, including [[BBC North West]], [[BBC Manchester]], [[BBC Sport]], [[CBBC|BBC Children's]], [[CBeebies]], [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]], [[BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra]], ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'', [[BBC Learning]] and the [[BBC Philharmonic]] have all moved from their previous locations in either London or [[New Broadcasting House (Manchester)|New Broadcasting House]], Manchester to the new 200-acre (80ha) [[MediaCityUK]] production facilities in [[City of Salford|Salford]], that form part of the large [[BBC North|BBC North Group]] division and will therefore become the biggest staffing operation outside London.<ref>{{cite news | title = BBC Salford move gets green light | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6708383.stm | author = BBC News Online | date = 31 May 2007 | access-date = 31 May 2007 | author-link = BBC News Online | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070831014258/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6708383.stm | archive-date = 31 August 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="BBC North Website">{{cite web|title=BBC North |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/bbcnorth/index.shtml |publisher=BBC |access-date=11 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620125506/http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/bbcnorth/index.shtml |archive-date=20 June 2011 }}</ref>

As well as the two main sites in London (Broadcasting House and White City), there are seven other important BBC production centres in the UK, mainly specialising in different productions. [[BBC Wales headquarters building|Cardiff]] is been home to [[BBC Cymru Wales]], which specialises in drama production.  Open since 2012, and containing 7 new studios, Roath Lock<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roathlock.com/ |title=Roath Lock studios |publisher=Roathlock.com |access-date=29 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401070507/http://roathlock.com/ |archive-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> is notable as the home of productions such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''. [[Broadcasting House (Belfast)|Broadcasting House Belfast]], home to [[BBC Northern Ireland]], specialises in original drama and comedy, and has taken part in many co-productions with independent companies and notably with [[RTÉ]] in the Republic of Ireland. [[BBC Scotland]], based in [[BBC Pacific Quay|Pacific Quay, Glasgow]] is a large producer of programmes for the network, including several quiz shows. In England, the larger regions also produce some programming.

Previously, the largest hub of BBC programming from the [[BBC English Regions|regions]] is BBC North West. At present they produce all religious and ethical programmes on the BBC, as well as other programmes such as ''[[A Question of Sport]]''. However, this is to be merged and expanded under the [[BBC North]] project, which involved the region moving from [[New Broadcasting House (Manchester)|New Broadcasting House]], Manchester, to [[MediaCityUK]]. [[BBC West Midlands|BBC Midlands]], based at [[The Mailbox]] in Birmingham, also produces drama and contains the headquarters for the [[BBC English Regions|English regions]] and the BBC's daytime output. Other production centres include [[Broadcasting House (Bristol)|Broadcasting House Bristol]], home of [[BBC West]] and famously the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] and to a lesser extent, [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill]] in Leeds, home of [[BBC Yorkshire]]. There are also many smaller local and regional studios throughout the UK, operating the BBC regional television services and the [[BBC Local Radio]] stations.

The BBC also operates several news gathering centres in various locations around the world, which provide news coverage of that region to the national and international news operations.

In 2004, the BBC contracted out its former BBC Technology division to the German engineering and electronics company [[Siemens IT Solutions and Services]] (SIS), [[outsourcing]] its [[Information technology|IT]], [[telephony]] and [[Broadcast engineering|broadcast technology]] systems.<ref name="bbc-2204"/> When Atos Origin acquired the SIS division from [[Siemens]] in December 2010 for €850&nbsp;million (£720m),<ref name=cw-siemens>{{cite news|title=Atos Origin acquires Siemens division for €850m|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/1280094628/Atos-Origin-acquires-Siemens-division-for-850m|access-date=27 May 2013|newspaper=Computer Weekly|date=15 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512145155/http://www.computerweekly.com/news/1280094628/Atos-Origin-acquires-Siemens-division-for-850m|archive-date=12 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> the BBC support contract also passed to [[Atos]], and in July 2011, the BBC announced to staff that its technology support would become an Atos service.<ref name="atos-ariel"/> Siemens staff working on the BBC contract were transferred to Atos; the BBC's [[Information technology|Information Technology systems]] are now managed by Atos.<ref>{{Cite web|date=11 May 2017|title=Atos signs new contract with BBC for technology services|url=https://atos.net/en/2017/press-release/general-press-releases_2017_05_11/atos-signs-new-contract-bbc-technology-services|access-date=10 July 2020|website=Atos|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2011, the BBC's [[Chief Financial Officer]] [[Zarin Patel]] stated to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] that, following criticism of the BBC's management of major IT projects with Siemens (such as the [[Digital Media Initiative]]), the BBC partnership with Atos would be instrumental in achieving cost savings of around £64&nbsp;million as part of the BBC's "Delivering Quality First" programme.<ref name=publicaccounts>{{cite web|title=BBC Effiicency Programme|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmpubacc/c1658-i/c165801.htm|website=House of Commons Public Accounts Committee|publisher=UK Parliament|access-date=27 May 2013|date=21 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205203852/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmpubacc/c1658-i/c165801.htm|archive-date=5 February 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, the BBC's [[Chief Technology Officer]], [[John Linwood (BBC)|John Linwood]], expressed confidence in service improvements to the BBC's technology provision brought about by Atos.

BBC One is a regionalised TV service which provides opt-outs throughout the day for local news and other local programming. These variations are more pronounced in the BBC "Nations", i.e. [[BBC Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]], [[BBC Scotland|Scotland]] and [[BBC Wales|Wales]], where the presentation is mostly carried out locally on BBC One and Two, and where programme schedules can vary greatly from that of the network. BBC Two variations exist in the Nations; however, [[BBC English Regions|English regions]] today rarely have the option to opt out as regional programming now only exists on BBC One. BBC Two was also the first channel to be transmitted on 625 lines in 1964, then carry a small-scale regular colour service from 1967. BBC One would follow in November 1969.

A new [[Scottish Gaelic]] television channel, [[BBC Alba (TV channel)|BBC Alba]], was launched in September 2008. It is also the first multi-genre channel to come entirely from Scotland with almost all of its programmes made in Scotland. The service was initially only available via [[Satellite television|satellite]] but since June 2011 has been available to viewers in Scotland on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] and cable television.<ref>{{cite news | title = BBC Alba Freeview date unveiled | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-13479551 | date = 23 May 2011 | access-date = 28 July 2011 | work = BBC News | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110526044519/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-13479551 | archive-date = 26 May 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref>

The BBC currently operates [[High-definition television|HD]] simulcasts of all its nationwide channels with the exception of [[BBC Parliament]]. Until 26 March 2013, a separate channel called [[BBC HD]] was available, in place of [[BBC Two HD]]. It launched on 9 June 2006, following a 12-month trial of the broadcasts. It became a proper channel in 2007, and screened HD programmes as simulcasts of the main network, or as repeats. The corporation has been producing programmes in the format for many years, and stated that it hoped to produce 100% of new programmes in HDTV by 2010.<ref>{{cite web | title = BBC Press Release: ''BBC to trial High Definition broadcasts in 2006'' | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/11_november/08/hdtv.shtml | date = 8 November 2005 | access-date = 7 July 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060518191221/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/11_november/08/hdtv.shtml | archive-date = 18 May 2006 | url-status = live }}</ref> On 3 November 2010, a high-definition simulcast of BBC One was launched, entitled [[BBC One HD]], and BBC Two HD launched on 26 March 2013, replacing BBC HD.

In the Republic of Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the BBC channels are available in a number of ways. In these countries digital and cable operators carry a range of BBC channels. These include BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Four and BBC World News, although viewers in the Republic of Ireland may receive BBC services via overspill from transmitters in Northern Ireland or Wales, or via "deflectors"—transmitters in the Republic which rebroadcast broadcasts from the UK,<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/aerial-warfare-1268455.html Aerial warfare] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009190739/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/aerial-warfare-1268455.html |date=9 October 2017 }}, [[John Waters (columnist)|John Waters]], ''[[The Independent]]'', 21 April 1997</ref> received off-air, or from digital satellite.

Since 1975, the BBC has also provided its TV programmes to the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service|British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS)]], allowing members of [[Military of the United Kingdom|UK military]] serving abroad to watch them on four dedicated TV channels. From 27 March 2013, BFBS will carry versions of BBC One and BBC Two, which will include children's programming from [[CBBC]], as well as carrying programming from [[BBC Three]] on a new channel called [[Forces TV|BFBS Extra]].

Since 2008, all the BBC channels are available to watch online through the [[BBC iPlayer]] service. This online streaming ability came about following experiments with live streaming, involving streaming certain channels in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/11_november/19/simulcast.shtml |title=BBC One and BBC Two to be simulcast from 27 November |publisher=BBC |date=19 November 2008 |access-date=15 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825055004/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/11_november/19/simulcast.shtml |archive-date=25 August 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> In February 2014, Director-General Tony Hall announced that the corporation needed to save £100&nbsp;million.

{{Main|BBC Radio|BBC Local Radio}}

The BBC has ten radio stations serving the whole of the UK, a further seven stations in the "national regions" ([[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]]), and 39 other local stations serving defined areas of England. Of the ten national stations, five are major stations and are available on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and/or [[AM broadcasting|AM]] as well as on [[Digital radio in the United Kingdom|DAB]] and online. These are [[BBC Radio 1]], offering new music and popular styles and being notable for its chart show; [[BBC Radio 2]], playing [[Adult contemporary music|Adult contemporary]], country and soul music amongst many other genres; [[BBC Radio 3]], presenting classical and jazz music together with some spoken-word programming of a cultural nature in the evenings; [[BBC Radio 4]], focusing on current affairs, factual and other speech-based programming, including drama and comedy; and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], broadcasting 24-hour news, sport and talk programmes.

[[File:Current-portrait-of-the-radio-Ingrid-Bergman-142360829576.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Swedish actress [[Ingrid Bergman]] being interviewed on BBC Radio in October 1954]]

In addition to these five stations, the BBC runs a further five stations that broadcast on DAB and online only. These stations supplement and expand on the big five stations, and were launched in 2002. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] sisters Radio 1, and broadcasts new black music and urban tracks. [[BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra]] sisters 5 Live and offers extra sport analysis, including broadcasting sports that previously were not covered. [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] offers alternative music genres and is notable as a platform for new artists.

[[BBC Radio 7]], later renamed [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]], provided archive drama, comedy and children's programming. Following the change to Radio 4 Extra, the service has dropped a defined children's strand in favour of family-friendly drama and comedy. In addition, new programmes to complement Radio 4 programmes were introduced such as ''[[Ambridge Extra]]'', and ''Desert Island Discs revisited''. The final station is the [[BBC Asian Network]], providing music, talk and news to this section of the community. This station evolved out of Local radio stations serving certain areas, and as such this station is available on [[Medium Wave]] frequency in some areas of the Midlands.

As well as the national stations, the BBC also provides 40 [[BBC Local Radio]] stations in England and the Channel Islands, each named for and covering a particular city and its surrounding area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Bristol]]), county or region (e.g. [[BBC Three Counties Radio]]), or geographical area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Solent]] covering the central south coast). A further six stations broadcast in what the BBC terms "the national regions": Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. These are [[BBC Radio Wales]] (in English), [[BBC Radio Cymru]] (in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), [[BBC Radio Scotland]] (in English), [[BBC Radio nan Gaidheal]] (in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]), [[BBC Radio Ulster]], and [[BBC Radio Foyle]], the latter being an opt-out station from Radio Ulster for the north-west of Northern Ireland.

The BBC's UK national channels are also broadcast in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (although these [[Crown dependencies]] are outside the UK), and in the former there are two local stations – [[BBC Guernsey]] and [[BBC Radio Jersey]]. There is no BBC local radio station, however, in the Isle of Man, partly because the island has long been served by the popular independent commercial station, [[Manx Radio]], which predates the existence of BBC Local Radio. BBC services in the dependencies are financed from [[television licence]] fees which are set at the same level as those payable in the UK, although collected locally. This is the subject of some controversy in the Isle of Man since, as well as having no BBC Local Radio service, the island also lacks a local television news service analogous to that provided by [[BBC Channel Islands News|BBC Channel Islands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/tv-licence-fee-not-value-for-money-inquiry-hears-1-3053173 |title=TV licence fee not value for money – inquiry hears |publisher=Iomtoday.co.im |date=8 February 2011 |access-date=1 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221125549/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/tv-licence-fee-not-value-for-money-inquiry-hears-1-3053173 |archive-date=21 December 2012 }}</ref>

For a worldwide audience, the [[BBC World Service]] provides news, current affairs and information in 28 languages, including English, around the world and is available in over 150 capital cities.

Historically, the BBC was the only legal radio broadcaster based in the UK mainland until 1967, when [[URY|University Radio York (URY)]], then under the name ''Radio York'', was launched as the first, and now oldest, legal independent radio station in the country. However, the BBC did not enjoy a complete monopoly before this as several Continental stations, such as [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], had broadcast programmes in English to Britain since the 1930s and the Isle of Man-based [[Manx Radio]] began in 1964. Today, despite the advent of [[commercial radio]], BBC radio stations remain among the most listened to in the country, with Radio 2 having the largest audience share (up to 16.8% in 2011–12) and Radios 1 and 4 ranked second and third in terms of weekly [[Reach (advertising)|reach]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Stuart |last=Corke |url=http://mediatel.co.uk/radio/news/2012/10/25/rajar-q3-2012-national-stations/ |title=MediaTel information for all BBC and commercial radio stations |publisher=Mediatel.co.uk |date=25 October 2012 |access-date=1 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221125554/http://mediatel.co.uk/radio/news/2012/10/25/rajar-q3-2012-national-stations/ |archive-date=21 December 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

BBC programming is also available to other services and in other countries. Since 1943, the BBC has provided radio programming to the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]], which broadcasts in countries where British troops are stationed. [[BBC Radio 1]] is also carried in the United States and [[Canada]] on [[Sirius XM Radio]] (online streaming only).

The BBC's online presence includes a comprehensive [[BBC News Online|news website]] and archive. The BBC's first official online service was the [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01x6fgw BBC Networking Club], which was launched on 11 May 1994. The service was subsequently relaunched as BBC Online in 1997, before being renamed BBCi, then bbc.co.uk, before it was rebranded back as BBC Online. The website is funded by the Licence fee, but uses [[Geo targeting|GeoIP]] technology, allowing advertisements to be carried on the site when viewed outside of the UK.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6385175.stm |title=BBC keeps web adverts on agenda |work=BBC News |date=22 February 2007 |access-date=15 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115111900/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6385175.stm |archive-date=15 January 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> The BBC claims the site to be "Europe's most popular content-based site"<ref>{{cite web | title = bbc.co.uk Commissioning | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/newmedia/websites.shtml | access-date =6 July 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060706020809/http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/newmedia/websites.shtml| archive-date= 6 July 2006 | url-status=live}}</ref> and states that 13.2&nbsp;million people in the UK visit the site's more than two million pages each day.<ref>{{cite web | title = bbc.co.uk Key Facts | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/website.shtml | access-date =6 July 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060524233844/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/website.shtml| archive-date= 24 May 2006 | url-status=live}}</ref>

The centre of the website is the Homepage, which features a modular layout. Users can choose which modules, and which information, is displayed on their homepage, allowing the user to customise it. This system was first launched in December 2007, becoming permanent in February 2008, and has undergone a few aesthetical changes since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2007/12/a_lick_of_paint_for_the_bbc_ho.html|title=A lick of paint for the BBC homepage|first=Richard|last=Titus|publisher=BBC Internet Blog|date=13 December 2007|access-date=5 February 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080205231721/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2007/12/a_lick_of_paint_for_the_bbc_ho.html| archive-date= 5 February 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref> The Homepage then has links to other micro-sites, such as [[BBC News Online]], [[BBC Sport|Sport]], [[BBC Weather|Weather]], TV and Radio. As part of the site, every programme on BBC Television or Radio is given its own page, with bigger programmes getting their own micro-site, and as a result it is often common for viewers and listeners to be told [[Uniform Resource Locator|website addresses]] (URLs) for the programme website.

Another large part of the site also allows users to watch and listen to most Television and Radio output live and for seven days after broadcast using the [[BBC iPlayer]] platform, which launched on 27 July 2007, and initially used [[peer-to-peer]] and [[Digital rights management|DRM]] technology to deliver both radio and TV content of the last seven days for offline use for up to 30&nbsp;days, since then video is now streamed directly. Also, through participation in the [[Creative Archive Licence]] group, bbc.co.uk allowed legal downloads of selected archive material via the internet.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/01_january/03/archive.shtml | title = BBC Press Release: ''BBC News opens its archives for the first time'' | date = 3 January 2006 | access-date=3 October 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060903045904/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/1_january/03/archive.shtml| archive-date= 3 September 2006 | url-status=live}}</ref>

The BBC has often included learning as part of its online service, running services such as [[BBC Jam]], [[BBC Learning Zone|Learning Zone Class Clips]] and also runs services such as [[BBC WebWise]] and First Click which are designed to teach people how to use the internet. [[BBC Jam]] was a free online service, delivered through broadband and narrowband connections, providing high-quality interactive resources designed to stimulate learning at home and at school. Initial content was made available in January 2006; however, BBC Jam was suspended on 20 March 2007 due to allegations made to the [[European Commission]] that it was damaging the interests of the commercial sector of the industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/14_03_2007.html |title=BBC Trust suspends BBC Jam |publisher=[[BBC Trust]] |date=14 March 2007 |access-date=5 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126171441/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/14_03_2007.html |archive-date=26 January 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

In recent years, some major on-line companies and politicians have complained that BBC Online receives too much funding from the television licence, meaning that other websites are unable to compete with the vast amount of advertising-free on-line content available on BBC Online.<ref>{{cite web | title = Department of Culture, Media and Sport: Independent Review of BBC Online, pp41-58 | url = http://www.culture.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/45F9953F-CE61-4325-BEA6-400DF9722494/0/BBCOnlinereview.pdf | last = Graf | first = Philip | access-date =6 July 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060723051550/http://www.culture.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/45F9953F-CE61-4325-BEA6-400DF9722494/0/BBCOnlinereview.pdf| archive-date= 23 July 2006 | url-status=live}}</ref> Some have proposed that the amount of licence fee money spent on BBC Online should be reduced—either being replaced with funding from advertisements or subscriptions, or a reduction in the amount of content available on the site.<ref>{{cite web|author=British Internet Publishers Alliance |title=BIPA Response to Review of the BBC's Royal Charter |url=http://www.bipa.co.uk/getArticle.php?ID=325 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060827040457/http://www.bipa.co.uk/getArticle.php?ID=325 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 August 2006 |date=31 May 2005 |access-date=6 July 2006 }}</ref> In response to this the BBC carried out an investigation, and has now set in motion a plan to change the way it provides its online services. BBC Online will now attempt to fill in gaps in the market, and will guide users to other websites for currently existing market provision. (For example, instead of providing local events information and timetables, users will be guided to outside websites already providing that information.)
Part of this plan included the BBC closing some of its websites, and rediverting money to redevelop other parts.<ref>{{cite news | title = Public value key to BBC websites |work=BBC News  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3992875.stm | date = 8 November 2004 | access-date =6 July 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060616150109/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3992875.stm| archive-date= 16 June 2006 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1219009.ece |title=99 per cent of the BBC archives is on the shelves.

===Interactive television===
{{Main|BBC Red Button}}

BBC Red Button is the brand name for the BBC's [[Interactive television|interactive]] [[digital television]] services, which are available through [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] (digital terrestrial), as well as [[Freesat]], [[Sky (UK & Ireland)|Sky]] (satellite), and [[Virgin Media]] (cable). Unlike [[Ceefax]], the service's analogue counterpart, BBC Red Button is able to display full-colour graphics, photographs, and video, as well as programmes and can be accessed from any BBC channel. The service carries News, Weather and Sport 24 hours a day, but also provides extra features related to programmes specific at that time. Examples include viewers to play along at home to gameshows, to give, voice and vote on opinions to issues, as used alongside programmes such as ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]''. At some points in the year, when multiple sporting events occur, some coverage of less mainstream sports or games are frequently placed on the Red Button for viewers to watch. Frequently, other features are added unrelated to programmes being broadcast at that time, such as the broadcast of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' animated episode ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'' in November 2009.

===Music===
[[File:BBC Big Band - Town Hall Birmingham - May 2012.jpg|thumb|The [[BBC Big Band]] ]]
The BBC employs 5 staff orchestras, a professional choir, and supports two amateur choruses, based in BBC venues across the UK;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras|title=BBC Orchestras and Choirs|website=BBC Music Events|language=en|access-date=2 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014201823/https://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], the [[BBC Singers]] and [[BBC Symphony Chorus]] based in London, the [[BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] in Glasgow, the [[BBC Philharmonic]] in Salford, the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] based in Watford, and the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] and [[BBC National Chorus of Wales]] in Cardiff. It also buys a selected number of broadcasts from the [[Ulster Orchestra]] in Belfast and the [[BBC Big Band]].

The [[The Proms|BBC Proms]] have been produced by the BBC every year since 1927,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1sgMxZvFzHQG3Y1HktMfg6w/history-of-the-proms|title=BBC Radio 3 – BBC Proms – History Of The Proms|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414071428/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1sgMxZvFzHQG3Y1HktMfg6w/history-of-the-proms|archive-date=14 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> stepping in to fund the popular classical music festival when music publishers Chappell and Co withdrew their support. In 1930, the newly formed BBC Symphony Orchestra gave all 49 Proms, and have performed at every Last Night of the Proms since then. Nowadays, the BBC's orchestras and choirs are the backbone of the Proms,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/proms-2017/artists/bbc-orchestras-choirs|title=BBC – BBC orchestras and choirs – Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref> giving around 40%–50% of all performances each season.

Many famous musicians of every genre have played at the BBC, such as [[The Beatles]] (''[[Live at the BBC (Beatles album)|Live at the BBC]]'' is one of their many albums). The BBC is also responsible for the broadcast of [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[Reading Festival]] and [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] coverage of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], a show with which the broadcaster has been associated for over 60 years. The BBC also operates the division of BBC Audiobooks sometimes found in association with Chivers Audiobooks.

===Other===
The BBC operates other ventures in addition to their broadcasting arm. In addition to broadcasting output on television and radio, some programmes are also displayed on the [[BBC Big Screen]]s located in several central-city locations. The BBC and the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] also jointly run [[BBC Monitoring]], which monitors radio, television, the press and the internet worldwide. The BBC also developed several computers throughout the 1980s, most notably the [[BBC Micro]], which ran alongside the corporation's educational aims and programming.

In 1951, in conjunction with [[Oxford University Press]] the BBC published ''The BBC Hymn Book'' which was intended to be used by radio listeners to follow hymns being broadcast.  The book was published both with and without music, the music edition being entitled ''The BBC Hymn Book with Music''.<ref>British Broadcasting Corporation (1969) ''The BBC Hymn Book with Music''  London: Oxford University Press</ref> The book contained 542 popular hymns.

===Ceefax===
{{Main|Ceefax}}

The BBC provided the world's first teletext service called [[Ceefax]] (near-homonymous with "See Facts") on 23 September 1974 until 23 October 2012 on the [[BBC 1]] analogue channel then later on [[BBC 2]]. It showed informational pages such as News, Sport and the Weather. on New Year's Eve in 1974, competition from [[ITV plc|ITV]]'s [[ORACLE (teletext)|Oracle]] tried to compete with Ceefax. Oracle closed on New Year's Eve, 1992. During its lifetime it attracted millions of viewers, right up to 2012, prior to the [[UK digital transition|digital switchover in the United Kingdom]]. It ceased transmission at 23:32:19 BST on 23 October 2012 after 38 years. Since then, the BBC's [[BBC Red Button|Red Button Service]] has provided a digital-like information system that replaced Ceefax.

===BritBox===

In 2016, the BBC, in partnership with fellow UK Broadcasters ITV and Channel 4 (who later withdrew from the project), set up 'project kangaroo' to develop an international online streaming service to rival services such as Netflix and Hulu.<ref name="Variety">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/britbox-eastenders-streaming-prime-suspect-1202002791/|title=Britbox, a streaming service for British TV from BBC and ITV, launches in the US|website=The Verge|access-date=12 December 2017|date=7 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228054022/https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/britbox-eastenders-streaming-prime-suspect-1202002791/|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/tv/bbc-set-to-launch-britflix-rival-to-netflix-after-john-whittingdale-approves-subscription-streaming/ar-BBt5imj?ocid=spartandhp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609191342/http://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/tv/bbc-set-to-launch-britflix-rival-to-netflix-after-john-whittingdale-approves-subscription-streaming/ar-BBt5imj?ocid=spartandhp|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 June 2016|title=BBC set to launch Britflix rival to Netflix after John Whittingdale approves subscription streaming|website=www.msn.com|access-date=17 May 2016}}</ref> During the development stages 'Britflix' was touted as a potential name.

==Commercial activities==
{{Main|BBC Studios}}

BBC Studios (formerly [[BBC Worldwide]]) is the wholly owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC, responsible for the commercial exploitation of BBC programmes and other properties, including a number of television stations throughout the world. It was formed following the restructuring of its predecessor, BBC Enterprises, in 1995.

The company owns and administers a number of commercial stations around the world operating in a number of territories and on a number of different platforms. The channel [[BBC Entertainment]] shows current and archive entertainment programming to viewers in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East, with the BBC Studios channels [[BBC America]] and [[BBC Canada]] (Joint venture with [[Corus Entertainment]]) showing similar programming in the North America region and [[BBC UKTV]] in the Australasia region. The company also airs two channels aimed at children, an international [[CBeebies]] channel and [[BBC Kids]], a joint venture with [[Knowledge Network|Knowledge Network Corporation]], which airs programmes under the CBeebies and BBC K brands. The company also runs the channels [[BBC Knowledge (international)|BBC Knowledge]], broadcasting factual and learning programmes, and [[BBC Lifestyle]], broadcasting programmes based on themes of Food, Style and Wellbeing. In addition to this, BBC Studios runs an international version of the channel [[BBC HD Scandinavia|BBC HD]], and provides HD simulcasts of the channels BBC Knowledge and BBC America.

BBC Studios also distributes the 24-hour international news channel [[BBC World News]]. The station is separate from BBC Studios to maintain the station's neutral point of view, but is distributed by BBC Studios. The channel itself is the oldest surviving entity of its kind, and has 50 foreign news bureaus and correspondents in nearly all countries in the world.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last1=Henery|first1=Michelle|title=Why Do We See What We See: A comparison of CNN International, BBC World News and Al Jazeera English, analysing the respective drivers influencing editorial content|url=https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Why%20do%20we%20see%20what%20we%20see%20A%20comparison%20of%20CNN%20International,%20BBC%20World%20News%20and%20Al%20Jazeera%20English%20analysing%20the%20respective%20drivers%20influencing%20editorial%20cont.pdf|website=reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk|publisher=Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford, 2010|access-date=15 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920130100/https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Why%20do%20we%20see%20what%20we%20see%20A%20comparison%20of%20CNN%20International,%20BBC%20World%20News%20and%20Al%20Jazeera%20English%20analysing%20the%20respective%20drivers%20influencing%20editorial%20cont.pdf|archive-date=20 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> As officially surveyed, it is available to more than 294&nbsp;million households, significantly more than [[CNN]]'s estimated 200&nbsp;million.
<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
In addition to these international channels, BBC Studios also owns the [[UKTV]] network of seven channels. These channels contain BBC archive programming to be rebroadcast on their respective channels: [[Alibi (TV channel)|Alibi]], crime dramas; [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] (slogan: "The Home of Witty Banter"); [[Drama (British TV channel)|Drama]], drama, launched in 2013; [[Eden (TV channel)|Eden]], nature; [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]], comedy; [[W (UK TV channel)|W]], Entertainment; and [[Yesterday (TV channel)|Yesterday]], history programming.

In addition to these channels, many BBC programmes are sold via BBC Studios to foreign television stations with comedy, documentaries and [[Costume drama|historical drama]] productions being the most popular. In addition, BBC television news appears nightly on many [[Public Broadcasting Service]] stations in the United States, as do reruns of BBC programmes such as ''[[EastEnders]]'', and in New Zealand on [[TVNZ 1]].

In addition to programming, BBC Studios produces material to accompany programmes. The company maintained the publishing arm of the BBC, [[BBC Magazines]], which published the ''[[Radio Times]]'' as well as a number of magazines that support BBC programming such as ''[[Top Gear (magazine)|BBC Top Gear]]'', ''[[BBC Good Food]]'', ''[[The Sky at Night|BBC Sky at Night]]'', ''[[BBC History (magazine)|BBC History]]'', ''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' and ''[[BBC Music Magazine|BBC Music]]''. BBC Magazines was sold to Exponent Private Equity in 2011, which merged it with Origin Publishing (previously owned by BBC Worldwide between 2004 and 2006) to form [[Immediate Media Company]].

BBC Studios also publishes books, to accompany programmes such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'' under the [[BBC Books]] brand, a publishing imprint majority owned by [[Random House]]. Soundtrack albums, talking books and sections of radio broadcasts are also sold under the brand [[BBC Records]], with DVDs also being sold and licensed in large quantities to consumers both in the UK and abroad under the [[2 Entertain]] brand. Archive programming and classical music recordings are sold under the brand BBC Legends.

Until the development, popularisation, and domination of television, radio was the broadcast medium upon which people in the United Kingdom relied.
