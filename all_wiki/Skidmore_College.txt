'''Skidmore College''' is a [[Private school|private]] [[liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. Approximately 2,650 students are enrolled at Skidmore pursuing a [[Bachelor of Arts]] or [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in one of more than 60 areas of study.

==History==
Skidmore College has undergone many transformations since its founding in the early 20th century as a [[women's colleges in the United States|women's college]]. The Young Women's Industrial Club was formed in 1903 by [[Lucy Ann Skidmore]] (1853–1931) with inheritance money from her husband who died in 1879, and from her father, Joseph Russell Skidmore (1821–1882), a former coal merchant. In 1911, the club was chartered under the name "Skidmore School of Arts" as a college to vocationally and professionally train young women.<ref>[http://www.skidmore.edu/skidmorehistory/centennial/skidmore-seals/ssa.php "Skidmore School of Arts"]. Skidmore College. Retrieved June 10, 2014.</ref>

<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Charles Henry Keyes.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Charles Henry Keyes]], the first president of Skidmore College]] -->
[[Charles Henry Keyes]] became the first president of the school in 1912, and in 1919 Skidmore conferred its first baccalaureate degrees under the authority of the [[University of the State of New York]]. By 1922 the school had been chartered independently as a four-year, degree-granting college.

Skidmore College was in downtown [[Saratoga Springs]] at first, but on October 28, 1961, the college acquired the Jonsson Campus, {{convert|850|acre|km2}} of land on the outer edges of Saratoga Springs. The Jonsson Campus was named for the Skidmore trustee [[J. Erik Jonsson|Erik Jonsson]], the founder and president of [[Texas Instruments]] and a former mayor of [[Dallas, Texas]] (1964–71). The new Jonsson Tower bears his name. The first new buildings on the campus opened in 1966, and by 1973 the move was mostly complete. The old campus was sold to Verrazzano College, a new institution that did not prove successful, and its buildings have since been put to other uses.

In 1971, the college began admitting men to its regular undergraduate program (a few dozen male [[World War II]] veterans had been admitted in 1946-49). Skidmore also launched the "University Without Walls" (UWW) program, which allows nonresident students over age 25 to earn bachelor's degrees. The program ended in May 2011. Also in 1971, Skidmore established a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] chapter.

In 1988, Skidmore faculty formed the Collaborative Research Program, which provides students with opportunities to co-author papers and studies with professors. Skidmore began granting master's degrees in 1991 through its Master of Arts in Liberal Studies (MALS) program. The Skidmore Honors Forum was founded in 1998.

In 2003, [[Philip A. Glotzbach]] became the College's seventh president.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Skidmore-president-to-step-down-next-year-13637542.php|title=Skidmore College president to step down next year|last=Karlin|first=Rick|date=2019-02-25|website=Times Union|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> After his presidency was announced, to welcome him to Skidmore, students rallied and drummed up support for his presidency by writing slogans in chalk on sidewalks around the campus.{{citation needed |date=June 2016}} In February 2019, Glotzbach announced that he would retire at the end of the 2019-2020 school year.<ref name=":0" />

2006 marked the start of the largest campaign in Skidmore's history, ''Creative Thought. Bold Promise.'' The goal was to raise $200 million, which was reached and surpassed in 2010 and celebrated at Celebration Weekend.

==Academics==
Skidmore grants students the ability to pursue a wide variety of degrees. There are 43 majors, an average class size of 16, and more than 1000 courses offered. The most popular majors pursued by Skidmore students include English, business, psychology, political science, economics, studio art, theater, biology and environmental studies.<ref name=admissionsfacts>{{cite web |title=Admissions Facts |url=https://www.skidmore.edu/admissions/facts/index.php |website=skidmore.edu |accessdate=15 December 2019}}</ref> The World Language department is especially diverse, and enables students to take classes in over six different languages. 
Students are also encouraged to take their education outside of the classroom with internships. These can be taken for credit and can be completed throughout the academic year; nearly 85% of students participate in an internship during their Skidmore career.<ref name=admissionsfacts /> Opportunities for these internships are highly publicized both by the departments themselves and by the career center.
Due to the definition of degrees by New York State, Skidmore cannot accredit all departments with a Bachelors of Science. A B.S. is given to those students majoring in Art (Studio), Dance, Dance-Theater, Education, Exercise Science, Business, Social Work, and Theater. The distinction rests in the number of hours of "non-liberal arts" courses allowed toward the 120 credit hours needed for graduation, 60 for a B.S. and 30 for a B.A. These "non-liberal arts"-designated courses are considered by the college to be of a professional nature.<ref>[http://catalog.skidmore.edu/index.php?catoid=5 "Catalog 2014  –2015"].

Each spring as classes wind down, the Student Government Association hosts an all-day holiday known as "Fun Day" on the green, featuring bounce-tents, bounce-slides, hot dogs, snow cones, body paint and live music. Students spread blankets out on the lawn where they spend the better part of the day eating, drinking, playing guitars, napping, and generally living up to the nature of the event.

===A cappella===
Skidmore currently has 6 a cappella groups: 1 all male, 3 co-ed, and 2 female. The Sonneteers, the first of the all female groups, is Skidmore's first and oldest a cappella group (founded in 1947). The Bandersnatchers is the only all male a cappella group on campus. The Dynamics (Dynos) is Skidmore's oldest co-ed a cappella group (founded in 1995). The Drastic Measures (Drastics) is the second oldest co-ed a cappella group. It was founded as an all-inclusive charitable a cappella group; while it is no longer all-inclusive, the group retains its charitable mission to this day. The Accents is the final female a cappella group. All groups perform on and off campus throughout the semester, holding auditions at the beginning of each semester and concluding each semester with a "Jam." The newest a cappella group, the Treblemakers, is Skidmore's third co-ed a cappella group. Chartered in 2010, the Treblemakers is the college's only remaining all-inclusive a cappella group. They constantly perform with many of the other all-inclusive performance groups on campus.
In addition to the a cappella groups, Lift Every Voice, Skidmore's Gospel Choir, was established in 2008 and chartered in 2009 as an official club. It is nowadays known as People Who Sing and has been readjusted to feature more secular music.

===Sustainability===
Skidmore's Strategic Plan reflects the college's commitment to sustainability and includes a pledge to deepen connections with the local community, emphasize planning for sustainable operation, and reduce the college's environmental footprint. Three of Skidmore's buildings have geothermal heating and cooling systems, and the college has recently hired a sustainability coordinator to assist with efforts to "green" the campus.<ref>[http://www.skidmore.edu/sustainability/ "Sustainable Skidmore"].

The Skidmore Golf team was the first team to participate in an NCAA Championship in 1987 and has continued to do so for the past 26 years.

From 1971 until 1982, Skidmore athletic teams were nicknamed the "[[Wombats]]". In 1982 the team nickname was changed to "Thoroughbreds" because it was felt that the wombat "lacked the image of an athlete."<ref>{{cite news|title=Skidmore: From Wombats to Thoroughbreds|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&dat=19821023&id=fFwpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6b4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=1171,2382180&hl=en|accessdate=Nov 28, 2015|work=The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)|date=Oct 23, 1982}}</ref>
