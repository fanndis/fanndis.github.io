The '''Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media''' (including its previous names) is the [[Grammy Award]] awarded to songs written for films, television, video games or other visual media. Through the years it's been awarded, since 1988, it has gone through several name changes:

==History==
* 1988–1999: The Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television
* 2000–2011: The Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media
* 2012–present: The Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media

The award goes to the composer(s) of the winning song, not to the performing artist(s) (except if the artist is also the composer).

==Multiple winners and nominees==
[[Alan Menken]] has the most wins (five times). After him, [[Randy Newman]] has three wins whilst [[James Horner]], [[Howard Ashman]], [[T Bone Burnett]] and [[Lady Gaga]] have two wins each. [[Alan Menken]] and [[Lady Gaga]] are the only artists to win this category in consecutive years.

[[Diane Warren]] has the most nominations with ten, followed by [[Alan Menken]] with nine, [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] with seven, [[James Horner]] and [[T Bone Burnett]] with four each, [[Madonna]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Howard Ashman]], [[Tim Rice]], [[Michael Kamen]] and [[Taylor Swift]] with three each (all of them won at least one Grammy).

[[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Beyoncé]] are the most nominated artists without wins (nominated three times). [[Stephen Sondheim]], [[Elton John]], [[Elvis Costello]] and [[U2]] were nominated two times without winning.
[[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds|Babyface]] was the artist with more nominations in a single year with 3 nominations in 1997 but failed to win the award that year. The 2018 film ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' is the first to be nominated and win two years in a row.

*<sup>{{note|1|[I]}}</sup> Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.
*<sup>{{note|2|[II]}}</sup> "[[The Climb (Miley Cyrus song)|The Climb]]", written by [[Jessi Alexander]] and Jon Mabe and featured in ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]'', was originally nominated but was withdrawn by [[Walt Disney Records]] because it had not been written specifically for a film as the category's eligibility rules require. NARAS released a statement thanking Disney for its honesty and announcing that "The Climb" had been replaced by "All Is Love", with the fifth highest initial votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/12/10/miley-cyrus-disqualified-from-grammys/|author= Pastorek, Whitney |title=Miley Cyrus song disqualified from Grammy noms, Karen O called up to replace her|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=December 10, 2009|access-date=December 10, 2009}}</ref>
