The '''Executive Board of the European Central Bank''' is the organ responsible for implementing [[monetary policy]] for the [[Eurozone]]  in line with the guidelines and decisions taken by the [[Governing Council of the European Central Bank]].

Members of the Executive Board of the [[European Central Bank]] are nominated by agreement between the Heads of Government of the [[Eurozone]] countries for a non-renewable eight-year term (members nominated in 1998 for the original board had their terms staged so that one would be replaced each year). Under the ECB's rules board members do not ''represent'' a particular country, nor are they responsible for keeping track of economic conditions in one country.  Instead, all board members are jointly responsible for monetary policy for the entire Euro area. Members generally take office in June.
