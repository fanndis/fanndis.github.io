== Pathophysiology ==
Coeliac disease appears to be multifactorial, both in that more than one genetic factor can cause the disease and in that more than one factor is necessary for the disease to manifest in a person.

Almost all people (95%) with coeliac disease have either the variant [[HLA-DQ2]] [[allele]] or (less commonly) the [[HLA-DQ8]] [[allele]].<ref name=VanHeelWest/><ref>{{Cite book|title = Oxford handbook of Clinical Medicine|last = Longmore|first = Murray|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 9780199609628|pages = 280}}</ref> However, about 20–30% of people without coeliac disease have also inherited either of these alleles.<ref name="pmid17785484"/> This suggests additional factors are needed for coeliac disease to develop; that is, the predisposing HLA risk allele is necessary but not sufficient to develop coeliac disease. Furthermore, around 5% of those people who do develop coeliac disease do not have typical HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles (see below).<ref name=VanHeelWest/>

The two subunits of the HLA-DQ protein are encoded by the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, located on the short arm of [[chromosome 6]].

There are seven [[HLA-DQ]] variants (DQ2 and DQ4–DQ9). Over 95% of people with coeliac have the isoform of DQ2 or DQ8, which is inherited in families. The reason these genes produce an increase in risk of coeliac disease is that the receptors formed by these genes bind to gliadin peptides more tightly than other forms of the antigen-presenting receptor. Therefore, these forms of the receptor are more likely to activate [[T cell|T lymphocytes]] and initiate the autoimmune process.<ref name=VanHeelWest/>

[[File:HLA.svg|right|thumb|150px|HLA region of chromosome 6]]
Most people with coeliac bear a two-gene HLA-DQ2 [[haplotype]] referred to as [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.5|DQ2.5 haplotype]]. This haplotype is composed of two adjacent gene [[allele]]s, DQA1*0501 and [[HLA-DQ2#DQB1*0201|DQB1*0201]], which encode the two subunits, DQ α<sup>5</sup> and DQ β<sup>2</sup>. In most individuals, this DQ2.5 isoform is encoded by one of two chromosomes 6 inherited from parents (DQ2.5cis). Most coeliacs inherit only one copy of this DQ2.5 haplotype, while some inherit it from ''both'' parents; the latter are especially at risk for coeliac disease as well as being more susceptible to severe complications.<ref name="pmid17190762">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jores RD, Frau F, Cucca F, Grazia Clemente M, Orrù S, Rais M, De Virgiliis S, Congia M | s2cid = 7675714 | title = HLA-DQB1*0201 homozygosis predisposes to severe intestinal damage in celiac disease | journal = Scand.

Some individuals inherit DQ2.5 from one parent and an additional portion of the haplotype (either DQB1*02 or DQA1*05) from the other parent, increasing risk. Less commonly, some individuals inherit the DQA1*05 allele from one parent and the DQB1*02 from the other parent (DQ2.5trans) (called a trans-haplotype association), and these individuals are at similar risk for coeliac disease as those with a single DQ2.5-bearing chromosome 6, but in this instance disease tends not to be familial. Among the 6% of European coeliacs that do not have DQ2.5 (cis or trans) or DQ8 (encoded by the haplotype DQA1*03:DQB1*0302), 4% have the [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.2 and gluten|DQ2.2]] isoform, and the remaining 2% lack DQ2 or DQ8.<ref name="pmid12651074">{{cite journal |vauthors=Karell K, Louka AS, Moodie SJ, Ascher H, Clot F, Greco L, Ciclitira PJ, Sollid LM, Partanen J | title = HLA types in celiac disease patients not carrying the DQA1*05-DQB1*02 (DQ2) heterodimer: results from the European Genetics Cluster on Celiac Disease | journal = Hum.

Given the characteristics of the disease and its apparent strong heritability, it would normally be expected that the genotypes would undergo negative selection and to be absent in societies where agriculture has been practised the longest (compare with a similar condition, [[Lactose intolerance]], which has been negatively selected so strongly that its prevalence went from ~100% in ancestral populations to less than 5% in some European countries). This expectation was first proposed by Simoons (1981).<ref>{{cite book|title=Food, nutrition, and evolution: food as an environmental factor in the genesis of human variability| last1 = Walcher | first1 = Dwain N. | last2 = Kretchmer | first2 = Norman | name-list-style = vanc |pages=179–199|publisher=Papers presented at the International Congress of the International Organization for the Study of Human Development, Masson Pub.

Membrane leaking permits peptides of gliadin that stimulate two levels of immune response, the innate response and the adaptive (T-helper cell mediated) response. One protease-resistant peptide from α-gliadin contains a region that stimulates lymphocytes and results in the release of [[interleukin-15]]. This [[Gluten immunochemistry#Innate immunity|innate response to gliadin]] results in immune-system signalling that attracts inflammatory cells and increases the release of inflammatory chemicals.<ref name=VanHeelWest/> The strongest and most common adaptive response to gliadin is directed toward an [[Gluten immunochemistry#A2-gliadin|α2-gliadin fragment]] of 33&nbsp;amino acids in length.<ref name=VanHeelWest/>

Deamidation is the reaction by which a glutamate residue is formed by cleavage of the epsilon-amino group of a glutamine side chain. Transamidation, which occurs three times more often than deamidation, is the cross-linking of a glutamine residue from the gliadin peptide to a lysine residue of tTg in a reaction that is catalysed by the transglutaminase. Crosslinking may occur either within or outside the active site of the enzyme. The latter case yields a permanently covalently linked complex between the gliadin and the tTg.<ref name=Fleckenstein>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fleckenstein B, Molberg Ø, Qiao SW, Schmid DG, von der Mülbe F, Elgstøen K, Jung G, Sollid LM | s2cid = 7102008 | title = Gliadin T cell epitope selection by tissue transglutaminase in celiac disease.

=== Villous atrophy and malabsorption ===
The inflammatory process, mediated by [[T cell]]s, leads to disruption of the structure and function of the small bowel's mucosal lining and causes malabsorption as it impairs the body's ability to absorb [[nutrient]]s, minerals, and fat-soluble [[vitamin]]s A, D, E, and K from food. Lactose intolerance may be present due to the decreased bowel surface and reduced production of [[lactase]] but typically resolves once the condition is treated.

Alternative causes of this tissue damage have been proposed and involve release of [[interleukin 15]] and activation of the innate immune system by a shorter gluten peptide (p31–43/49). This would trigger killing of [[enterocyte]]s by lymphocytes in the [[epithelium]].<ref name=VanHeelWest/> The villous atrophy seen on biopsy may also be due to unrelated causes, such as [[tropical sprue]], [[giardiasis]] and [[radiation enteritis]]. While positive serology and typical biopsy are highly suggestive of coeliac disease, lack of response to diet may require these alternative diagnoses to be considered.<ref name=AGA/>

== Diagnosis ==
[[Medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.<ref name=CichewiczMearns2019 /><ref name=MatthiasPfeiffer2010>{{cite journal|vauthors=Matthias T, Pfeiffer S, Selmi C, Eric Gershwin M|s2cid=33661098|title=Diagnostic challenges in celiac disease and the role of the tissue transglutaminase-neo-epitope|journal=Clin Rev Allergy Immunol|volume=38|issue=2–3|pages=298–301|date=April 2010|pmid=19629760|doi=10.1007/s12016-009-8160-z|type=Review}}</ref> It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.<ref name=CichewiczMearns2019 />

There are several tests that can be used. The level of [[symptom]]s may determine the order of the tests, but ''all'' tests lose their usefulness if the person is already eating a [[gluten-free diet]]. [[Small intestine|Intestinal]] damage begins to heal within weeks of gluten being removed from the diet, and [[antibody]] levels decline over months. For those who have already started on a gluten-free diet, it may be necessary to perform a [[gluten challenge test|rechallenge]] with some gluten-containing food in one meal a day over 6 weeks before repeating the investigations.<ref name="NICEcoeliac"/>

=== Blood tests ===
[[File:ENDOMYSIAL ANTIBODIES.jpg|thumb|[[Immunofluorescence]] staining pattern of endomysial antibodies on a monkey oesophagus tissue sample.]]
[[Serology|Serological]] blood tests are the first-line investigation required to make a diagnosis of coeliac disease. Its sensitivity correlates with the degree of histological lesions. People who present minor damage of the small intestine may have seronegative findings so many patients with coeliac disease often are missed. In patients with villous atrophy, anti-[[endomysium|endomysial]] (EMA) antibodies of the [[immunoglobulin A]] (IgA) type can detect coeliac disease with a [[sensitivity and specificity]] of 90% and 99%, respectively.<ref name="pmid20442390">{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Windt DA, Jellema P, Mulder CJ, Kneepkens CM, van der Horst HE |title=Diagnostic testing for celiac disease among patients with abdominal symptoms: a systematic review |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume=303 |issue=17 |pages=1738–46 |year=2010 |pmid=20442390 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.549 | quote=Most studies used similar histological criteria for diagnosing celiac disease (Marsh grade ≥III), but the level of damage may vary across populations.

The presence of positive serum antibodies has been shown to correlate with the degree of villous atrophy, and patients with celiac disease who have less severe histological damage may have seronegative findings.

Tissue transglutaminase modifies gluten [[peptide]]s into a form that may stimulate the immune system more effectively.<ref name=VanHeelWest/> These peptides are modified by tTG in two ways, deamidation or transamidation.<ref name="Skovbjerg"/> Modern anti-tTG assays rely on a human [[recombinant DNA|recombinant protein]] as an [[antigen]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sblattero D, Berti I, Trevisiol C, Marzari R, Tommasini A, Bradbury A, Fasano A, Ventura A, Not T |title=Human recombinant tissue transglutaminase ELISA: an innovative diagnostic assay for celiac disease |journal=[[The American Journal of Gastroenterology|Am.

Guidelines recommend that a total serum IgA level is checked in parallel, as people with coeliac with IgA deficiency may be unable to produce the antibodies on which these tests depend ("false negative").

Antibody testing may be combined with [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] testing if the diagnosis is unclear.

An [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|upper endoscopy]] with [[biopsy]] of the [[duodenum]] (beyond the [[duodenal bulb]]) or [[jejunum]] is performed to obtain multiple samples (four to eight) from the duodenum.

Most people with coeliac disease have a [[small intestine]] that appears to be normal on endoscopy before the biopsies are examined. However, five findings have been associated with a high specificity for coeliac disease: scalloping of the small bowel folds (''pictured''), paucity in the folds, a [[mosaic]] pattern to the [[mucous membrane|mucosa]] (described as a "cracked-mud" appearance), prominence of the [[submucosa]] [[blood vessel]]s, and a nodular pattern to the mucosa.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Niveloni S, Fiorini A, Dezi R, Pedreira S, Smecuol E, Vazquez H, Cabanne A, Boerr LA, Valero J, Kogan Z, Mauriño E, Bai JC |title=Usefulness of videoduodenoscopy and vital dye staining as indicators of mucosal atrophy of celiac disease: assessment of interobserver agreement |journal=Gastrointestinal Endoscopy |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=223–29 |year=1998 |pmid=9580349 |doi=10.1016/S0016-5107(98)70317-7 }}</ref>

European guidelines suggest that in children and adolescents with symptoms compatible with coeliac disease, the diagnosis can be made without the need for intestinal biopsy if [[Coeliac disease#Blood tests|anti-tTG antibodies]] titres are very high (10 times the upper limit of normal).<ref name=ESPGHAN2012 />

Until the 1970s, biopsies were obtained using metal capsules attached to a suction device. The capsule was swallowed and allowed to pass into the small intestine. After [[x-ray]] verification of its position, suction was applied to collect part of the intestinal wall inside the capsule.

[[Capsule endoscopy]] (CE) allows identification of typical mucosal changes observed in coeliac disease but has a lower sensitivity compared to regular endoscopy and histology. CE is therefore not the primary diagnostic tool for coeliac disease. However, CE can be used for diagnosing T-cell lymphoma, ulcerative jejunoileitis and adenocarcinoma in refractory or complicated coeliac disease.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Redondo-Cerezo E, Sánchez-Capilla AD, De La Torre-Rubio P, De Teresa J |title=Wireless capsule endoscopy: Perspectives beyond gastrointestinal bleeding |journal=[[World Journal of Gastroenterology|World J.

=== Pathology ===
The classic pathology changes of coeliac disease in the small bowel are categorised by the "Marsh classification":<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marsh MN |title=Gluten, major histocompatibility complex, and the small intestine.

* Marsh stage 0: normal mucosa
* Marsh stage 1: increased number of intra-epithelial [[lymphocyte]]s (IELs), usually exceeding 20 per 100 [[enterocyte]]s
* Marsh stage 2: proliferation of the [[intestinal gland|crypts of Lieberkühn]]
* Marsh stage 3: partial or complete [[intestinal villus|villous]] [[atrophy]] and crypt hypertrophy<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Corazza GR, Villanacci V |title=Coeliac disease |journal=[[Journal of Clinical Pathology|J.

* Marsh stage 4: [[hypoplasia]] of the [[small intestine]] architecture

Marsh's classification, introduced in 1992, was subsequently modified in 1999 to six stages, where the previous stage 3 was split in three substages.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Oberhuber G, Granditsch G, Vogelsang H |title=The histopathology of coeliac disease: time for a standardized report scheme for pathologists |journal=[[European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology|Eur.

* A representing lymphocytic infiltration with normal villous appearance;
* B1 describing partial villous atrophy; and
* B2 describing complete villous atrophy.

The changes classically improve or reverse after [[gluten]] is removed from the diet. However, most guidelines do not recommend a repeat biopsy unless there is no improvement in the symptoms on diet.<ref name="AGA"/><ref name="NASPGHAN"/> In some cases, a deliberate gluten challenge, followed by biopsy, may be conducted to confirm or refute the diagnosis. A normal biopsy and normal serology after challenge indicates the diagnosis may have been incorrect.<ref name="AGA"/>

In untreated coeliac disease, villous atrophy is more common in children younger than three years, but in older children and adults, it is common to find minor intestinal lesions ([[duodenal lymphocytosis]]) with normal [[intestinal villi]].<ref name=VivasVaquero2015 /><ref name=MolinaInfanteSantolaria2015 />

=== Other diagnostic tests ===
At the time of diagnosis, further investigations may be performed to identify complications, such as [[iron deficiency]] (by [[complete blood count|full blood count]] and iron studies), [[Folate deficiency|folic acid]] and [[Vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]] and [[hypocalcaemia]] (low calcium levels, often due to decreased [[vitamin D]] levels). [[Thyroid function tests]] may be requested during blood tests to identify [[hypothyroidism]], which is more common in people with coeliac disease.<ref name="AFP"/>

[[Osteopenia]] and [[osteoporosis]], mildly and severely reduced bone mineral density, are often present in people with coeliac disease, and investigations to measure bone density may be performed at diagnosis, such as [[dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DXA) scanning, to identify risk of fracture and need for bone protection medication.<ref name="AGA"/><ref name="AFP"/>

=== Gluten withdrawal ===
Although blood antibody tests, biopsies, and genetic tests usually provide a clear diagnosis,<ref name=AGA2006 /><ref name="pmid20442390" /> occasionally the response to gluten withdrawal on a [[gluten-free diet]] is needed to support the diagnosis. Currently, [[Gluten challenge test|gluten challenge]] is no longer required to confirm the diagnosis in patients with intestinal lesions compatible with coeliac disease and a positive response to a gluten-free diet.<ref name=AGA2006 /> Nevertheless, in some cases, a gluten challenge with a subsequent biopsy may be useful to support the diagnosis, for example in people with a high suspicion for coeliac disease, without a biopsy confirmation, who have negative blood antibodies and are already on a gluten-free diet.<ref name=AGA2006 /> Gluten challenge is discouraged before the age of 5 years and during [[puberty|pubertal]] growth.<ref name=OntiverosHardy>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ontiveros N, Hardy MY, Cabrera-Chavez F |title=Assessing of Celiac Disease and Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity |journal=Gastroenterology Research and Practice |volume=2015|pages=1–13 |year=2015 |pmid=26064097 |pmc=4429206 |doi=10.1155/2015/723954 |type=Review }}</ref> The alternative diagnosis of [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity|non-coeliac gluten sensitivity]] may be made where there is only symptomatic evidence of gluten sensitivity.<ref name=GenuisLobo2014>{{cite journal|vauthors=Genuis SJ, Lobo RA|title=Gluten sensitivity presenting as a neuropsychiatric disorder|journal=Gastroenterol Res Pract|volume=2014|page=293206|date=2014|pmid=24693281|pmc=3944951|doi=10.1155/2014/293206|type=Review}}</ref> Gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms of people with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity can be similar to those of coeliac disease,<ref name=TonuttiBizzaro2014 /> and improve when gluten is removed from the diet,<ref name="pmid22345659">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ludvigsson JF, Leffler DA, Bai JC, Biagi F, Fasano A, Green PH, Hadjivassiliou M, Kaukinen K, Kelly CP, Leonard JN, Lundin KE, Murray JA, Sanders DS, Walker MM, Zingone F, Ciacci C |title=The Oslo definitions for coeliac disease and related terms |journal=Gut |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=43–52 |date=January 2013 |pmid=22345659 |pmc=3440559 |doi=10.1136/gutjnl-2011-301346 }}</ref><ref name=ElliRoncorni>{{cite journal |vauthors=Elli L, Roncoroni L, Bardella MT|title=Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: Time for sifting the grain |journal=World J Gastroenterol |volume=21|issue=27|pages=8221–6|date=July 2015 |pmid=26217073 |pmc= 4507091 |doi=10.3748/wjg.v21.i27.8221|type= Review }}</ref> after coeliac disease and [[wheat allergy]] are reasonably excluded.<ref name="FasanoSapone2015">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fasano A, Sapone A, Zevallos V, Schuppan D|title=Nonceliac gluten sensitivity |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=148|issue=6|pages=1195–204|date=May 2015|pmid=25583468 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2014.12.049|type=Review}}</ref>

== History ==
The term "coeliac" is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κοιλιακός (''koiliakós'', "abdominal") and was introduced in the 19th century in a translation of what is generally regarded as an [[Ancient Greek]] description of the disease by [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]].<ref name="Aretaeus">{{Cite book|last=Adams F, translator |title=The extant works of Aretaeus, The Cappadocian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v4gIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PT1 |chapter= On The Cœliac Affection |pages=350–1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v4gIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA350 |access-date=12 December 2009 |year=1856 |publisher=Sydenham Society |location=London}}</ref><ref name="Losowsky">{{cite journal | vauthors = Losowsky MS | s2cid = 10062937 | title = A history of coeliac disease | journal = Digestive Diseases | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 112–20 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18431060 | doi = 10.1159/000116768 }}</ref>

Humans first started to cultivate grains in the [[Neolithic]] period (beginning about 9500 BCE) in the [[Fertile Crescent]] in Western Asia, and it is likely that coeliac disease did not occur before this time. [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]], living in the second century in the same area, recorded a malabsorptive syndrome with chronic diarrhoea, causing a debilitation of the whole body.<ref name="Aretaeus"/> His "Cœliac Affection" (''coeliac'' from Greek κοιλιακός ''koiliakos'', "abdominal") gained the attention of Western medicine when [[Francis Adams (translator)|Francis Adams]] presented a translation of Aretaeus's work at the Sydenham Society in 1856. The patient described in Aretaeus' work had stomach pain and was atrophied, pale, feeble and incapable of work. The diarrhoea manifested as loose stools that were white, malodorous and flatulent, and the disease was intractable and liable to periodic return. The problem, Aretaeus believed, was a lack of heat in the stomach necessary to digest the food and a reduced ability to distribute the digestive products throughout the body, this incomplete digestion resulting in the diarrhoea. He regarded this as an affliction of the old and more commonly affecting women, explicitly excluding children. The cause, according to Aretaeus, was sometimes either another chronic disease or even consuming "a copious draught of cold water."<ref name="Aretaeus"/><ref name=Losowsky/>

The [[pediatrics|paediatrician]] [[Samuel Gee]] gave the first modern-day description of the condition in children in a lecture at [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street]], London, in 1887. Gee acknowledged earlier descriptions and terms for the disease and adopted the same term as Aretaeus (coeliac disease). He perceptively stated: "If the patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet." Gee recognised that milk intolerance is a problem with coeliac children and that highly starched foods should be avoided. However, he forbade rice, sago, fruit and vegetables, which all would have been safe to eat, and he recommended raw meat as well as thin slices of toasted bread. Gee highlighted particular success with a child "who was fed upon a quart of the best Dutch [[mussel]]s daily." However, the child could not bear this diet for more than one season.<ref name=Losowsky/><ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gee | first = SJ | year = 1888 | title = On the coeliac affection | journal = St Bartholomew's Hospital Report | volume = 24 | pages = 17–20 | url = http://web2.bium.univ-paris5.fr/livanc/?cote=epo0466&p=1&do=page | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231536/http://web2.bium.univ-paris5.fr/livanc/?cote=epo0466&p=1&do=page | archive-date = 26 September 2007 | df = dmy-all | access-date = 20 March 2007 }}</ref>

=== Christian churches and the Eucharist ===
Speaking generally, the various denominations of Christians celebrate a [[Eucharist]] in which a wafer or small piece of [[sacramental bread]] from wheat bread is blessed and then eaten. A typical wafer weighs about half a gram.<ref>[http://www.eden.co.uk/shop/peoples-alter-breads-single-cross-sealed-edge-white-125972.html One on-line site sells 1200 wafers weighing a total of 523 g] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916215312/http://www.eden.co.uk/shop/peoples-alter-breads-single-cross-sealed-edge-white-125972.html |date=16 September 2011 }}. Eden.co.uk (31 July 2013). Retrieved on 3 September 2013.</ref> [[Wheat flour]] contains around 10 to 13% gluten, so a single communion wafer may have more than 50&nbsp;mg of gluten, an amount that harms many people with coeliac, especially if consumed every day (see ''Diet'' above).

Many Christian churches offer their communicants gluten-free alternatives, usually in the form of a rice-based cracker or gluten-free bread. These include the [[United Methodist Church|United Methodist]], [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]], the Anglican Church (Church of England, UK) and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] may receive from the Chalice alone, or ask for gluten-reduced hosts; gluten-free ones however are not considered to still be wheat bread, and hence invalid matter.<ref>[http://www.catholicceliacs.org/Bishops.html Statement by the National Conference of Catholic bishops on the use of low gluten hosts at Mass] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716100106/http://www.catholicceliacs.org/Bishops.html |date=16 July 2013 }}.

==== Roman Catholic position ====
Roman Catholic [[doctrine]] states that for a valid [[Eucharist]], the bread to be used at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] must be made from wheat. Low-gluten [[Host (Holy Communion)|hosts]] meet all of the Catholic Church's requirements, but they are not entirely gluten free. Requests to use rice wafers have been denied.<ref>{{Cite news | agency = Associated Press | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5762478 | title = Girl with digestive disease denied Communion | work = NBC News | publisher = Microsoft | date = 8 December 2004 | access-date = 30 May 2006 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The issue is more complex for priests. As a celebrant, a priest is, for the fullness of the sacrifice of the Mass, absolutely required to receive under both species. On 24 July 2003, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated, "Given the centrality of the celebration of the Eucharist in the life of a priest, one must proceed with great caution before admitting to Holy Orders those candidates unable to ingest gluten or alcohol without serious harm."<ref>[[Pope Benedict XVI|Ratzinger, Joseph]] (24 July 2003).

=== Passover ===
The Jewish festival of [[Passover|Pesach]] (Passover) may present problems with its obligation to eat [[matzo]], which is unleavened bread made in a strictly controlled manner from wheat, barley, [[spelt]], oats, or rye. This rules out many other grains that are normally used as substitutes for people with gluten sensitivity, especially for [[Ashkenazi Jews]], who also avoid rice. Many kosher-for-Passover products avoid grains altogether and are therefore gluten-free. [[Potato starch]] is the primary starch used to replace the grains.

===Spelling===
Coeliac disease is the preferred spelling in [[American and British English spelling differences#ae and oe|British English]], while celiac disease is typically used in [[North American English]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/coeliac-disease|title=COELIAC DISEASE {{!}} meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.glutenfreedublin.com/coeliac-vs-celiac|title=Coeliac vs. Celiac|website=www.glutenfreedublin.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref>

Three main approaches have been proposed as new therapeutic modalities for coeliac disease: gluten detoxification, modulation of the [[intestinal permeability]], and modulation of the immune response.<ref name="Castillo-etal-2015">{{cite journal |vauthors=Castillo NE, Theethira TG, Leffler DA |title=The present and the future in the diagnosis and management of celiac disease |journal=Gastroenterology Report |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–11 |year=2015 |pmid=25326000 |pmc=4324867 |doi=10.1093/gastro/gou065 |type=Review}}</ref>

Using [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] wheat species, or wheat species that have been [[plant breeding|selectively bred]] to be minimally immunogenic, may allow the consumption of wheat. This, however, could interfere with the effects that gliadin has on the quality of dough. Alternatively, gluten exposure can be minimised by the ingestion of a combination of [[enzyme]]s ([[prolyl endopeptidase]] and a barley glutamine-specific [[cysteine endopeptidase]] ([[EP-B2]])) that degrade the putative 33-mer peptide in the [[duodenum]].<ref name=VanHeelWest/>

Alternative treatments under investigation include the inhibition of [[zonulin]], an endogenous signalling protein linked to increased permeability of the bowel wall and hence increased presentation of gliadin to the immune system. One inhibitor of this pathway is [[larazotide acetate]], which is currently scheduled for phase 3 clinical trials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.innovatebiopharma.com/inn-202.html|title=Innovate Biopharmaceuticals|website=www.innovatebiopharma.com|access-date=17 April 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418041125/http://www.innovatebiopharma.com/inn-202.html|archive-date=18 April 2016}}</ref> Other modifiers of other well-understood steps in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease, such as the action of HLA-DQ2 or tissue transglutaminase and the MICA/NKG2D interaction that may be involved in the killing of enterocytes.<ref name=VanHeelWest/>

Attempts to modulate the immune response with regard to coeliac disease are mostly still in phase I of clinical testing; one agent (CCX282-B) has been evaluated in a phase II clinical trial on the basis of small-intestinal biopsies taken from people with coeliac disease before and after gluten exposure.<ref name="Castillo-etal-2015"/>

Although popularly used as an [[complementary and alternative medicine|alternative treatment]] for people with autism, there is no good evidence that a [[gluten-free diet]] is of benefit.<ref name=Buie>{{cite journal |vauthors=Buie T |title=The relationship of autism and gluten |journal=Clin Ther |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=578–83 |year=2013 |pmid=23688532 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.04.011 |type=Review |quote=At this time, the studies attempting to treat symptoms of autism with diet have not been sufficient to support the general institution of a gluten-free or other diet for all children with autism.}}</ref><ref name="MariBausetZazpe">{{cite journal | vauthors = Marí-Bauset S, Zazpe I, Mari-Sanchis A, Llopis-González A, Morales-Suárez-Varela M| s2cid = 19874518 | title = Evidence of the gluten-free and casein-free diet in autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review | journal = J Child Neurol | volume = 29| issue = 12| pages = 1718–27| date = December 2014| pmid = 24789114|doi = 10.1177/0883073814531330| hdl = 10171/37087| hdl-access = free}}</ref><ref name="Millward2008">{{cite journal|vauthors=Millward C, Ferriter M, Calver S, Connell-Jones G | title=Gluten- and casein-free diets for autistic spectrum disorder | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | year= 2008 | issue= 2 | pages= CD003498 | pmid=18425890 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003498.pub3 | editor1-last=Ferriter| editor1-first=Michael | pmc=4164915}}</ref> In the subset of people who have [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity|gluten sensitivity]] there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors.<ref name=Buie /><ref name=VoltaCaio>{{cite journal | vauthors = Volta U, Caio G, De Giorgio R, Henriksen C, Skodje G, Lundin KE| title = Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: a work-in-progress entity in the spectrum of wheat-related disorders | journal = Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol | volume = 29| issue = 3| pages = 477–91| date = June 2015| pmid = 26060112 | doi = 10.1016/j.bpg.2015.04.006 | quote= autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been hypothesized to be associated with NCGS [47,48].
