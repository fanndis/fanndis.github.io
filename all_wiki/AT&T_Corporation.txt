'''AT&T Corporation''', originally the '''American Telephone and Telegraph Company''', is the subsidiary of [[AT&T|AT&T Inc.]] that provides voice, video, data, and [[Internet]] telecommunications and professional services to [[business]]es, [[consumer]]s, and government agencies.

During its long history, AT&T was at times the world's largest [[telephone]] company, the world's largest [[cable television]] operator, and a regulated [[monopoly]]. At its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, it employed one million people and its revenue ranged between $3 billion in 1950 <ref>{{cite web |title=Annual Report 1950, American Telephone & Telegraph Company |url=https://www.beatriceco.com/bti/porticus/bell/pdf/1950ATTar_Complete.pdf}}</ref> (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3,261,528,032|1950}}}} in present-day terms{{Inflation-fn|US}}) and $12 billion in 1966 <ref>{{cite web |title=Annual Report 1966, American Telephone & Telegraph Company |url=https://www.beatriceco.com/bti/porticus/bell/pdf/1966ATTar_Complete.pdf}}</ref> (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|12,419,000,000|1966}}}} in present-day terms{{Inflation-fn|US}}).

In 2005, AT&T was purchased by [[Baby Bell]] and former subsidiary SBC Communications for more than $16 billion (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|16000000000|2005}}}} in present-day terms{{Inflation-fn|US}}). SBC then changed its name to [[AT&T|AT&T Inc.]]

==History==
{{main|History of AT&T}}

===Origins===
[[File:Bell System hires 1889 logo.PNG|100px|thumb|A [[Bell System]] logo (called the Blue Bell) used from 1889 to 1916.]]
[[File:AT&T 1921.jpg|thumb|Share of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, issued 20. December 1921]]

AT&T started with [[Bell Patent Association]], a legal entity established in 1874 to protect the patent rights of [[Alexander Graham Bell]] after he invented the telephone system. Originally a verbal agreement, it was formalized in writing in 1875 as [[Bell Telephone Company]].<ref>Bruce 1990, p. 291.{{Full citation needed|date=February 2014}}</ref><ref>Pizer 2009, pp. 120–124.Bruce 1990, p. 291{{Full citation needed|date=February 2014}}</ref>

In 1880 the management of American Bell had created what would become '''AT&T Long Lines'''. The project was the first of its kind to create a nationwide long-distance network with a commercially viable cost-structure. The project was formally incorporated in [[New York (state)|New York State]] as a separate company named '''American Telephone and Telegraph Company''' on March 3, 1885. Originating in [[New York City|New York]], its long-distance telephone network reached [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], in 1892,<ref name="Bruce 1990">Bruce 1990.Bruce 1990, p. 291{{Full citation needed|date=February 2014}}</ref> with its multitudes of local exchanges continuing to stretch further and further yearly, eventually creating a continent-wide telephone system. On December 30, 1899, the assets of American Bell were transferred into its subsidiary American Telephone and Telegraph Company (formerly ''AT&T Long Lines''); this was because [[Massachusetts]] corporate laws were very restrictive, and limited capitalization to ten million dollars, forestalling American Bell's further growth. With this assets transfer at the very end of the [[19th century]], AT&T became the parent of both American Bell and the [[Bell System]].<ref>Brooks 1976, p. 107.Bruce 1990, p. 291{{Full citation needed|date=February 2014}}</ref>

AT&T was involved mainly in the telephone business and, although it was a partner with [[RCA]], was reluctant to see radio grow because such growth might diminish the demand for wired services. It established station [[WNBC (AM)|WEAF]] in New York as what was termed a '''toll station'''. AT&T could provide no programming, but anyone who wished to broadcast a message could pay a "toll" to AT&T and then air the message publicly. The original studio was the size of a telephone booth. The idea, however, did not take hold, because people would pay to broadcast messages only if they were sure that someone was listening. As a result, WEAF began broadcasting entertainment material, drawing amateur talent found among its employees. Opposition to AT&T's expansion into radio and an agreement with the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] to lease long-distance lines for their broadcasts resulted in the sale of the station and its developing network of affiliates to NBC.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perry|first=S. D.|year=2004|title=A Consolidated History of Media|edition=3rd|location=Bloomington, IL|publisher=Epistelogic}}{{page needed|date= February 2014}}</ref>

===Monopoly===
Throughout most of the 20th century, AT&T held a monopoly on phone service in the United States and Canada through a network of companies called the [[Bell System]]. At this time, the company was nicknamed '''Ma Bell'''.

On April 30, 1907, [[Theodore Newton Vail]] became President of AT&T.<ref name="cato">{{Cite journal|last=Thierer|first=Adam D.|year=1994|title=Unnatural Monopoly: Critical Moments in the Development of the Bell System Monopoly|url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/1994/11/cj14n2-6.pdf|journal=Cato Journal|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|volume=14|issue=2|pages=267–285}}</ref><ref name="att milestones"/> Vail believed in the superiority of one phone system and AT&T adopted the slogan "One Policy, One System, Universal Service."<ref name="cato" /><ref name="att milestones">{{cite web|url=http://www.corp.att.com/history/milestones.html|title=AT&T Milestones in AT&T History|website=[[AT&T]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928163604/http://www.corp.att.com/history/milestones.html|archive-date=September 28, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=September 17, 2008}}</ref> This would be the company's philosophy for the next 70 years.<ref name="att milestones"/>

Under Vail, AT&T began buying up many of the smaller telephone companies including [[Western Union|Western Union telegraph]].<ref name="cato" /><ref name="att milestones"/> These actions brought unwanted attention from antitrust regulators. Anxious to avoid action from government [[competition law|antitrust]] suits, AT&T and the federal government entered into an agreement known as the [[Kingsbury Commitment]].<ref name="cato" /><ref name="att milestones"/> In the Kingsbury Commitment, AT&T and the government reached an agreement that allowed AT&T to continue operating as a monopoly. While AT&T periodically faced scrutiny from regulators, this state of affairs continued until the company's breakup in 1984.

===The Break-up===
{{further|Breakup of the Bell System|Regional Bell Operating Company}}

The United States Justice Department opened the case [[United States v. AT&T]] in 1974. This was prompted by suspicion that AT&T was using monopoly profits from its [[Western Electric]] subsidiary to subsidize the cost of its network, a violation of anti-trust law.<ref>Yurick, p.&nbsp;7.Bruce 1990, p. 291{{Full citation needed|date=February 2014}}</ref> A settlement to this case was finalized in 1982, leading to the [[Breakup of the Bell System|division of the company]] on January 1, 1984 into seven [[Regional Bell Operating Companies]], commonly known as Baby Bells. These companies were:
* [[Ameritech]], acquired by SBC in 1999, now part of AT&T Inc.
* Bell Atlantic (now [[Verizon Communications]]), which acquired [[GTE]] in 2000
* [[BellSouth]], acquired by AT&T Inc. in 2006
* [[NYNEX]], acquired by Bell Atlantic in 1996, now part of Verizon Communications
* [[Pacific Telesis]], acquired by SBC in 1997, now part of AT&T Inc.
* Southwestern Bell (later SBC, now [[AT&T Inc.]]), which acquired AT&T Corp. in 2005
* [[US West]], acquired by [[Qwest]] in 2000, which in turn was acquired by [[CenturyLink]] in 2011

Post-breakup, the former parent company's main business was now [[AT&T Communications Inc.]], which focused on long-distance services, and with other non-RBOC activities.

AT&T acquired [[NCR Corporation]] in 1991. AT&T announced in 1995 that it would split into three companies: a manufacturing/R&D company, a computer company, and a services company. [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[Bell Labs]] and AT&T Technologies were to be spun off by 1997. In preparation for its spin-off, AT&T Technologies was renamed [[Lucent Technologies]]. Lucent was completely spun off from AT&T in 1996.

===Acquisition by SBC===
{{Main|AT&T}}
On January 31, 2005, the "[[RBOC|Baby Bell]]" company [[SBC Communications]] announced its plans to acquire "Ma Bell" AT&T Corp. for $16 billion. SBC announced in October 2005 that it would shed the "SBC" brand and take the AT&T brand along with the "T" [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]] ticker symbol.

Merger approval concluded on November 18, 2005; SBC Communications began rebranding the following Monday, November 21 as "AT&T Inc." and began trading as [[AT&T]] on December 1 under the "T" symbol.

===The AT&T headquarters buildings===
From 1885 to 1910, AT&T was headquartered at 125 Milk Street in Boston. With its expansion it moved to New York City, to a headquarters on [[195 Broadway]] (close to what is now the [[World Trade Center site]]). The property originally belonged to [[Western Union]], of which AT&T held a controlling interest until 1913 when AT&T divested its interest as part of the [[Kingsbury Commitment]].<ref name="att milestones"/> Construction of the current building began in 1912. Designed by [[William Welles Bosworth]], who played a significant role in designing [[Kykuit]], the Rockefeller mansion north of [[Tarrytown, New York]], it was a modern steel structure clad top to bottom in a Greek-styled exterior, the three-story-high Ionic columns of Vermont granite forming eight registers over a Doric base.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Designing MIT: Bosworth's New Tech|last=Jarzombek|first=Mark|publisher=Northeastern University Press|year=2004|isbn=1555536190|location=Boston|pages=65–68|oclc=55124376}}</ref> The lobby of the AT&T Building was one of the most unusual ones of the era. Instead of a large double-high space, similar to the nearby [[Woolworth Building]], Bosworth designed what is called a "hypostyle hall", with full-bodied Doric columns modeled on the Parthenon, marking out a grid. Bosworth was seeking to coordinate the classical tradition with the requirements of a modern building. Columns were not merely the decorative elements they had become in the hands of other architects but created all the illusion of being real supports. Bosworth also designed the campus of [[MIT]] as well as [[Theodore N. Vail]]'s mansion in [[Morristown, New Jersey]].

In 1978, AT&T commissioned a new building at [[Sony Tower|550 Madison Avenue]]. This new [[Sony Building (New York)|AT&T Building]] was designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and quickly became an icon of the new [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodern]] architectural style. The building was completed in 1984, the very year of the divestiture of the Bell System. The building proved to be too large for the post-divestiture corporation and in 1993, AT&T leased the building to [[Sony]], which now owns it.<ref>{{cite web|first=Barry|last=Popik|date=September 25, 2005

==Divisions==
AT&T, prior to its merger with [[SBC Communications]], had three core companies:
* [[AT&T Alascom]]
* [[AT&T Communications Inc.|AT&T Communications]]
* [[AT&T Laboratories]]

[[AT&T Alascom]] continues to sell service in Alaska. [[AT&T Communications]] was renamed '''AT&T Communications - East, Inc.''' and sold long-distance telephone service and operated as a [[Competitive local exchange carrier|CLEC]] outside of the borders of the [[Bell Operating Companies]] that [[AT&T]] owns. It has now been absorbed into AT&T Corp. and all but 4 of the original 22 subsidiaries that formed AT&T Communications continue to exist. The AT&T company had become too large and the government, having water to prevent a monopoly forced AT&T to break up. [[AT&T Laboratories]] has been integrated into [[AT&T Labs]], formerly named [[SBC Laboratories]].

==Nicknames and branding==
AT&T was also known as "Ma Bell" and affectionately called "Mother" by phone [[phreak]]s. During some strikes by its employees, picketers would wear T-shirts reading, "Ma Bell is a real mother." It is worth noting too that, before the break-up, there was greater consumer recognition of the "Bell System" name, in comparison to the name AT&T. This prompted the company to launch an advertising campaign after the break-up to increase its name recognition. Spinoffs like the [[Regional Bell operating company|Regional Bell Operating Companies]] or ''RBOC''s were often called "Baby Bells". Ironically, "Ma Bell" was acquired by one of its "Baby Bells", [[SBC Communications]], in 2005.

The AT&T Globe Symbol,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.porticus.org/bell/bell_logos.html|title=Bell Logo History|last=Massey|first=David|website=Bell System Memorial|publisher=The Porticus Centre|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930051711/http://www.porticus.org/bell/bell_logos.html|archive-date=September 30, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> the corporate [[logo]] designed by [[Saul Bass]] in 1983 and originally used by [[AT&T Information Systems]], was created because part of the ''[[United States v. AT&T]]'' [[Breakup of the Bell System|settlement]] required AT&T to relinquish all claims to the use of [[Bell System]] trademarks. It has been nicknamed the "[[Death Star]]" in reference to the Death Star space station in ''[[Star Wars]]'' which the logo resembles. In 1999 it was changed from the 12-line design to the 8-line design. Again in 2005 it was changed to the 3D transparent "marble" design created by [[Interbrand]] for use by the parent company [[AT&T|AT&T Inc.]] This name was also given to the iconic [[Bell Labs Holmdel Complex|Bell Labs facility]] in [[Holmdel, New Jersey]], now vacant.
