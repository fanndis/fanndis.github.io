Independence was settled on land that was purchased from the [[Osage Nation|Osage]] Indians in September 1869 by George A.

Grant]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rydjord|first=John|title=Kansas Place-Names|year=1972|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma|page=349|isbn=0-8061-0994-7}}</ref> On August 21, 1869 a group of [[Oswego, Kansas]] men led by R.

==Geography==
Independence is located along the [[Verdigris River]] just south of its confluence with the [[Elk River (Kansas)|Elk River]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.75|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|7.74|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>

===Climate===
Independence has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'') characterized by hot, humid and unpleasant summers, and chilly though extremely variable winters. Precipitation is heavy in summer due to frequent incursions of very moist air from the Gulf of Mexico: as much as {{convert|7.69|in|mm|1}} fell on May 27, 1984 and a maximum daily fall of {{convert|3.49|in|mm|1|disp=or}} can be expected in an average calendar year. The wettest month has been June 2007 when {{convert|19.53|in|mm|1}} was reported, whereas July 1935 saw a mere {{convert|0.03|in|mm|1}}. The winters are drier and cold, although temperatures in winter are very erratic, ranging from an average of four afternoons in the three winter months above {{convert|70|F|C|1|disp=or}} to an average of three mornings below {{convert|0|F|C|1|disp=or}}. Winters are much drier than the summer, with November 1986 and October 1952 seeing not even a trace of precipitation.<ref name="NWS">[[National Weather Service]], Wichita, Kansas; [http://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=ict NOW Data]</ref>

Overall the wettest calendar year has been 1908 with {{convert|60.29|in|mm|1}} – although the incomplete year of 2007 likely had more than this – and the driest 1952 with only {{convert|18.27|in|mm|1}}.<ref name="NWS"/> The hottest month has been July 1936 with an average of {{convert|88|F|C|1}} and a mean maximum of {{convert|104.8|F|C|1|disp=or}}, while the coldest has been January 1979 with an average of {{convert|18.8|F|C|1}}, a mean maximum of only {{convert|28.9|F|C|1}} and a mean minimum of {{convert|8.7|F|C|1|disp=or}}.
