It continuously affects a child's [[temperament]], cognitive ability and their involvement with negative peers, dramatically affecting children's cooperative problem-solving skills.<ref name=":2" /> Many people also label behaviour which is deemed contrary to prevailing [[social norm|norms for social conduct]] as anti-social behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breckland.gov.uk/content/anti-social-behaviour-1 |title= Anti Social Behaviour|author=Anti Social Behaviour Team|date=2014|publisher=Breckland.gov.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018071111/http://www.breckland.gov.uk/content/anti-social-behaviour-1|archive-date=18 October 2014|url-status=dead |access-date= 2014-04-29}}</ref> However, researchers have stated that it is a difficult term to define, particularly in the United Kingdom where there are an infinite number of acts that fall into its category.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=t-tEBgAAQBAJ |title=Anti-Social Behaviour|last=Millie |first=Andrew|date=2008-12-01|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=9780335237623|url-status=live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180330143614/https://books.google.ca/books?id=t-tEBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |archivedate=30 March 2018}}</ref> The term is especially used in [[British English]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/antisocial|title=Antisocial|website=Oxford Dictionaries|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925014320/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/antisocial |archive-date=25 September 2016|url-status=live|access-date=2016-10-02}}</ref>

Although the term is fairly new to the common lexicon, the word ''anti-social behaviour'' has been used for many years in the psychosocial world where it was defined as "unwanted behaviour as the result of personality disorder."<ref name=":5" /> For example, [[David P. Farrington|David Farrington]], a British criminologist and forensic psychologist, stated that teenagers can exhibit anti-social behaviour by engaging in various amounts of wrongdoings such as stealing, [[vandalism]], sexual promiscuity, excessive smoking, heavy drinking, confrontations with parents, and gambling.<ref name=":5" /> Anti-social behaviour is typically associated with other behavioural and developmental issues such as hyperactivity, depression, learning disabilities and impulsivity. Alongside these issues one can be predisposed or more inclined to develop such behaviour due to one's genetics, neurobiological and environmental stressors in the prenatal stage of one's life, through the early childhood years.<ref name=":2" />

The [[American Psychiatric Association]], in its ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', diagnoses persistent anti-social behaviour as [[antisocial personality disorder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/antisocialpd.htm |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |publisher=BehaveNet |access-date=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120211144219/http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/antisocialpd.htm |archive-date=11 February 2012 }}</ref> Genetic factors include abnormalities in the [[prefrontal cortex]] of the brain while neurobiological risk include maternal drug use during pregnancy, birth complications, low birth weight, prenatal brain damage, traumatic head injury, and chronic illness.<ref name=":2" /> The [[World Health Organization]] includes it in the [[International Classification of Diseases]] as [[dissocial personality disorder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf60.htm+f602|title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717061553/http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf60.htm+f602 |archivedate=17 July 2009}}</ref> A pattern of persistent anti-social behaviours can also be present in children and adolescents diagnosed with conduct problems, including [[conduct disorder]] or [[oppositional defiant disorder]] under the [[DSM-5]].<ref name="McCart_2006">{{cite journal | vauthors = McCart MR, Priester PE, Davies WH, Azen R | title = Differential effectiveness of behavioral parent-training and cognitive-behavioral therapy for antisocial youth: a meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 527–43 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16838122 | doi = 10.1007/s10802-006-9031-1 | s2cid = 9940360 }}</ref> It has been suggested that individuals with intellectual disabilities have higher tendencies to display anti-social behaviours, but this may be related to social deprivation and mental health problems.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dickson K, Emerson E, Hatton C | title = Self-reported anti-social behaviour: prevalence and risk factors amongst adolescents with and without intellectual disability | journal = Journal of Intellectual Disability Research | volume = 49 | issue = Pt 11 | pages = 820–6 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16207279 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2005.00727.x }}</ref> More research is required on this topic.

==Development==
Intent and discrimination may determine both pro- and anti-social behaviour. [[Infant]]s may act in seemingly anti-social ways and yet be generally accepted as too young to know the difference before the age of 4 or 5.<ref name="Berger_2003" /> Berger states that parents should teach their children that "emotions need to be regulated, not depressed".<ref name="Berger_2003" />

Studies have shown that in children between ages 13–14 who bully or show aggressive behaviour towards others exhibit anti-social behaviours in their early adulthood.<ref name=":6" /> There are strong statistical relationships that show this significant association between childhood [[Aggression|aggressiveness]] and anti-social behaviours.<ref name=":6" /> Analyses saw that 20% of these children who exhibit anti-social behaviours at later ages had court appearances and police contact as a result of their behaviour.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal | vauthors = Renda J, Vassallo S, Edwards B | title = Bullying in early adolescence and its association with anti-social behaviour, criminality and violence 6 and 10 years later | journal = Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–27 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21370297 | doi = 10.1002/cbm.805 }}</ref>

Many of the studies regarding the media's influence on anti-social behaviour have been deemed inconclusive. Some reviews have found strong correlations between aggression and the viewing of violent media,<ref name="Anderson_2006">{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Craig A.|authorlink1=Craig A.

== Cause and effects ==
Families greatly impact the causation of anti-social behaviour.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781134587551|title=Taylor & Francis Group|website=www.taylorfrancis.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328041306/https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781134587551|archivedate=28 March 2018}}</ref> Some other familial causes are parent history of anti-social behaviours, parental alcohol and drug abuse, unstable home life, absence of good parenting, physical abuse, parental instability (mental health issues/[[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]) and economic distress within the family.<ref name=":2" />

There is a small link between antisocial personality characteristics in adulthood and more TV watching as a child. The risk of early adulthood criminal conviction increased by nearly 30 percent with each hour children spent watching TV on an average weekend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/news/2013/02/19/can-too-much-tv-in-childhood-cause-adult-antisocial-behavior/51762.html |title=Can Too Much TV in Childhood Cause Adult Antisocial Behavior?|last=Nauert|first=Rick |date= 8 August 2018|website= psychcentral.com |language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> Peers can also impact one's predisposition to anti-social behaviours, in particular, children in peer groups are more likely to associate with anti-social behaviours if present within their peer group.<ref name=":1" /> Especially within youth, patterns of lying, cheating and disruptive behaviours found in young children are early signs of anti-social behaviour.<ref name=":2" /> Adults must intervene if they notice their children providing these behaviours.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Early detection is best in the preschool years and middle school years in best hopes of interrupting the trajectory of these negative patterns. These patterns in children can lead to [[conduct disorder]], a disorder that allows children to rebel against atypical age-appropriate norms. Moreover, these offences can lead to oppositional defiant disorder, which allows children to be defiant against adults and create vindictive behaviours and patterns.<ref name=":1" /> Furthermore, children who exhibit anti-social behaviour also are more prone to alcoholism in adulthood.<ref name=":1" />

==Genetics==
A recent [[genome]]-wide analysis of anti-social behaviour in a large combined sample has shown that a large number of genetic variants of low individual effect play a role in anti-social behaviour.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Tielbeek|first1=Jorim J.|last2=Johansson |first2=Ada|last3=Polderman|first3=Tinca J. C.|last4=Rautiainen|first4=Marja-Riitta|last5=Jansen|first5=Philip|last6=Taylor |first6=Michelle|last7=Tong|first7=Xiaoran|last8=Lu|first8=Qing|last9=Burt|first9=Alexandra S.|date=2017-12-01|title=Genome-Wide Association Studies of a Broad Spectrum of Antisocial Behavior|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|language=en|volume=74|issue=12|pages=1242–1250 |doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.3069|pmid=28979981|pmc=6309228|issn=2168-622X}}</ref> Moreover, this study showed that several variants show gender-specific effects on anti-social behaviour in males and females. The study identified a specific gene which is one serotonin transporter gene variant is particularly associated with psychopathic trends in young people.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://psychcentral.com/news/2010/08/06/antisocial-behavior-linked-to-genes-and-environment/16513.html|title=Antisocial Behavior Linked to Genes and Environment|last=Nauert|first=Rick|date = 8 August 2018|website=psychcentral.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Intervention and treatment ==
As a high prevalence [[mental health]] problem in children, many interventions and treatments are developed to prevent anti-social behaviours and to help reinforce [[Prosocial behavior|pro-social behaviours]].<ref name="Braet_2009">{{cite journal | first1 = Caroline | last1 = Braet | first2 = Thierry | last2 = Meerschaert | first3 = Els | last3 = Merlevede | first4 = Guy | last4 = Bosmans | first5 = Karla Van | last5 = Leeuwen | first6 = Wim | last6 = De Mey | name-list-style = vanc | year = 2009 | title = Prevention of antisocial behaviour: Evaluation of an early intervention programme | journal = European Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 223–240 | doi = 10.1080/17405620601033194 | s2cid = 143771055 }}</ref>

Several factors are considered as direct or indirect causes of developing anti-social behaviour in children. Addressing these factors are necessary to develop a reliable and effective intervention or treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reyno SM, McGrath PJ | title = Predictors of parent training efficacy for child externalizing behavior problems--a meta-analytic review | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–111 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16405646 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01544.x }}</ref> Children's perinatal risk, temperament, [[intelligence]], nutrition level, and interaction with parents or caregivers can influence their behaviours. As for parents or caregivers, their [[Trait theory|personality traits]], behaviours, [[socioeconomic status]], [[social network]], and living environment can also affect children's development of anti-social behaviour.<ref name="Braet_2009" />

An individual's age at intervention is a strong predictor of the effectiveness of a given treatment.<ref name="McCart_2006" /> The specific kinds of anti-social behaviours exhibited, as well as the magnitude of those behaviours also impact how effective a treatment is for an individual.<ref name="Mash_2016" /> [[Behavioral parent training|Behavioural parent training]] (BPT) is more effective to preschool or elementary school-aged children, and [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioural therapy]] (CBT) has higher effectiveness for adolescents.<ref name="McCart_2006" /> Moreover, early intervention of anti-social behaviour is relatively more promising.<ref name=":2" /> For preschool children, family is the main consideration for the context of intervention and treatment. The interaction between children and parents or caregivers, parenting skills, social support, and socioeconomic status would be the factors.<ref name="Braet_2009" /> For school-aged children, the school context also needs to be considered.<ref name="Braet_2009" /> The collaboration amongst parents, teachers, and school psychologists are usually recommended to help children develop the ability of resolving conflicts, managing their anger, developing positive interactions with other students, and learning [[Prosocial behavior|pro-social behaviours]] within both home and school settings.<ref name=":22">{{Cite web |url=http://psychology.jrank.org/pages/37/Antisocial-Behavior.html|title=Antisocial Behavior - Causes and characteristics, Treatment|website=psychology.jrank.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504011919/http://psychology.jrank.org/pages/37/Antisocial-Behavior.html|archivedate=4 May 2016}}</ref>

Moreover, the training for parents or caregivers are also important. Their children would be more likely to learn positive social behaviours and reduce inappropriate behaviours if they become good role models and have effective parenting skills.<ref name=":22" />

=== Cognitive behavioural therapy ===
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy|Cognitive behavioural therapy]] (CBT), is a highly effective, evidence-based therapy, in relation to anti-social behaviour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-for-personality-disorders-cbt/.|title=Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Personality Disorders (CBT)|website=www.mentalhelp.net|access-date=2016-05-13|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318130231/https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-for-personality-disorders-cbt/|archivedate=18 March 2016}}</ref> This type of treatment focuses on enabling the patients to create an accurate image of the self, allowing the individuals to find the trigger of their harmful actions and changing how individuals think and act in social situations.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Armelius BA, Andreassen TH | title = Cognitive-behavioral treatment for antisocial behavior in youth in residential treatment | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD005650 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17943869 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005650.pub2 | pmc = 6885060 }}</ref> Due to their impulsivity, their inability to form trusting relationships and their nature of blaming others when a situation arises,<ref name="Black_2012">{{cite news | url = https://psychcentral.com/lib/treatment-for-antisocial-personality-disorder/ | title = Treatment for Antisocial Personality Disorder | last = Black | first = Donald | name-list-style = vanc | date = 2016 | work = Psych Central | access-date = 2018-02-28 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180321130400/https://psychcentral.com/lib/treatment-for-antisocial-personality-disorder/ | archivedate = 21 March 2018}}</ref> individuals with particularly aggressive anti-social behaviours tend to have maladaptive social cognitions, including [[hostile attribution bias]], which lead to negative behavioural outcomes.<ref name="McCart_2006" /> CBT has been found to be more effective for older children and less effective for younger children.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bennett DS, Gibbons TA | year = 2000 | title = Efficacy of Child Cognitive-Behavioral Interventions for Antisocial Behavior: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Child & Family Behavior Therapy | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | doi = 10.1300/J019v22n01_01 | s2cid = 144417587 }}</ref> [[Social problem-solving|Problem-solving skills training]] (PSST) is a type of CBT that aims to recognize and correct how an individual thinks and consequently behaves in social environments.<ref name="Mash_2016" /> This training provides steps to assist people in obtaining the skill to be able to evaluate potential solutions to problems occurring outside of therapy and learn how to create positive solutions to avoid physical aggression and resolve conflict.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cebc4cw.org/program/problem-solving-skills-training/detailed | title = Problem Solving Skills Training | last = Kazdin | first = Alan E. | name-list-style = vanc | date = 2009 | publisher = California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare | access-date = 2016-05-13 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160501091640/http://www.cebc4cw.org/program/problem-solving-skills-training/detailed | archivedate = 1 May 2016}}</ref>

Therapists, when providing CBT intervention to individuals with anti-social behaviour, should first assess the level of the risk of the behaviour in order to establish a plan on the duration and intensity of the intervention.<ref name="Black_2012" /> Moreover, therapists should support and motivate individuals to practice the new skills and behaviours in environments and contexts where the conflicts would naturally occur to observe the effects of CBT.<ref name=":3" />

=== Behavioural parent training ===
[[Parent management training|Behavioural parent training]] (BPT) or parent management training (PMT), focuses on changing how parents interact with their children and equips them with ways to recognize and change their child's maladaptive behaviour in a variety of situations. BPT assumes that individuals are exposed to reinforcements and punishments daily and that anti-social behaviour, which can be learned, is a result of these reinforcements and punishments.<ref name=":132">{{cite journal|last1=Serketich|first1=Wendy J. |last2=Dumas|first2=Jean E. | name-list-style = vanc |title=The effectiveness of behavioral parent training to modify antisocial behavior in children: A meta-analysis | journal=Behavior Therapy|volume=27|issue=2|pages=171–186|doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(96)80013-x|year=1996}}</ref> Since certain types of interactions between parents and children may reinforce a child's anti-social behaviour, the aim of BPT is to teach the parent effective skills to better manage and communicate with their child.<ref name="Mash_2016">{{cite book | title = Abnormal Child Psychology | vauthors= Mash EJ, Wolfe DA | publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company | year = 2016 | location = Belmont, CA | pages = 269 | isbn = 978-1-305-10542-3 }}</ref> This could be done by reinforcing pro-social behaviours while punishing or ignoring anti-social behaviours.<ref name=":132" /> It is important to note that the effects of this therapy can be seen only if the newly acquired communication methods are maintained.<ref name=":132" /> BPT has been found to be most effective for younger children under the age of 12.<ref name="McCart_2006" /><ref name="Mash_2016" /> Researchers credit the effectiveness of this treatment at younger ages due to the fact that younger children are more reliant on their parents.<ref name="McCart_2006" /> BPT is used to treat children with conduct problems, but also for children with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]].<ref name= "Mash_2016" />

According to a [[meta-analysis]], the effectiveness of BPT is supported by short-term changes on the children's anti-social behaviour.<ref name=":132" /> However, whether these changes are maintained over a longer period of time is still unclear.<ref name=":132" />

=== Psychotherapy ===
[[Psychotherapy]] or [[talk therapy]], although not always effective, can also be used to treat individuals with anti-social behaviour.<ref name=":23">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353934|title=Antisocial personality disorder - Diagnosis and treatment|last=Mayo Clinic|date=2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211130855/https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353934|archive-date=11 December 2017|url-status=live|access-date=24 February 2018}}</ref> Individuals can learn skills such as anger and violence management.<ref name=":23" /> This type of therapy can help individuals with anti-social behaviour bridge the gap between their feelings and behaviours, which they lack the connection previously.<ref name="recoveryranch">{{cite news | url = https://www.recoveryranch.com/articles/treat-antisocial-personality-disorder/ | title = How to Treat Antisocial Personality Disorder | publisher = The Ranch | date = 2017 | access-date = 2018-03-22 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180327023426/https://www.recoveryranch.com/articles/treat-antisocial-personality-disorder/ | archivedate = 27 March 2018}}</ref> It is most effective when specific issues are being discussed with individuals with anti-social behaviours, rather than a broad general concept. This type of therapy works well with individuals who are at a mild to moderate stage of anti-social behaviour since they still have some sense of responsibility regarding their own problems.<ref name="recoveryranch" />

When working with individuals with anti-social behaviour, therapist must be mindful of building a trusting [[therapeutic relationship]] since these individuals might have never experienced rewarding relationships.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://psychcentral.com/disorders/antisocial-personality-disorder/treatment/#psych|title=Antisocial Personality Disorder Treatment|last=Bressert|first=Steve|date=2017|work=Psych Central|access-date=2018-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317164815/https://psychcentral.com/disorders/antisocial-personality-disorder/treatment/#psych|archive-date=17 March 2018|url-status=live|language=en-US}}</ref> Therapists also need to be reminded that changes might take place slowly, thus an ability for noticing small changes and constant encouragement for individuals with anti-social behaviour to continue the intervention are required.<ref name=":4" />

==== Family therapy ====
[[Family therapy]], which is a type of psychotherapy, helps promote communication between family members, thus resolving conflicts related to anti-social behaviour.<ref name=":14">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/family-therapy/about/pac-20385237|title=Family therapy|last=Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221230251/https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/family-therapy/about/pac-20385237|archive-date=21 December 2017|url-status=live|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref> Since family exerts enormous influence over children's development, it is important to identify the behaviours that could potentially lead to anti-social behaviours in children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ojjdp.gov/mpg/litreviews/Family_Therapy.pdf|title=Family Therapy|last=Development Services Group, Inc. 2014|date=2014|website=Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328041158/https://www.ojjdp.gov/mpg/litreviews/Family_Therapy.pdf|archive-date=28 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It is a relatively short-term therapy which involves the family members who are willing to participate. Family therapy can be used to address specific topics such as aggression.<ref name=":14" /> The therapy may end when the family can resolve conflicts without needing the therapists to intervene.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tolan, PH|first=Mitchell, ME|date=January 2009|title=Families and the Therapy of Antisocial and Delinquent Behavior|journal=Journal of Psychotherapy & the Family|volume=6|issue=3–4|pages=29–48|doi=10.1300/J287v06n03_03}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
There is no official diagnosis for anti-social behaviour. However, we can have a look at the official diagnosis for [[Antisocial personality disorder|Antisocial Personality Disorder]] (ASPD) and use it as guideline while keeping in mind that anti-social behaviour and ASPD are not to be confused.

=== Distinguishing from antisocial personality disorder===
When looking at non-ASPD patients (who show anti-social behaviour) and ASPD patients, it all comes down to the same types of behaviours. However, ASPD is a [[Personality disorder|Personality Disorder]] which is defined by the consistency and stability of the observed behaviour, in this case, anti-social behaviour. [[Antisocial personality disorder|Antisocial Personality Disorder]] can only be diagnosed when a pattern of anti-social behaviour began being noticeable during childhood and/or early teens and remained stable and consistent across time and context.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|url=https://mcgill.worldcat.org/title/antisocial-personality-disorder-an-exploration-and-discussion-of-the-experience-impact-and-opinions-of-the-diagnosed-individual/oclc/610568886&referer=brief_results|title=Antisocial personality disorder: an exploration and discussion of the experience, impact and opinions of the diagnosed individual|last1=Bergen|first1=Steven|last2=Krane|first2=Julia|name-list-style=vanc|publisher=McGill University|year=2009|location=Montreal|pages=8|format=Thesis|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325232642/https://mcgill.worldcat.org/title/antisocial-personality-disorder-an-exploration-and-discussion-of-the-experience-impact-and-opinions-of-the-diagnosed-individual/oclc/610568886%26referer%3Dbrief_results|archivedate=25 March 2018}}</ref> In the official DSM IV-TR for ASPD, it is specified that the anti-social behaviour has to occur outside of time frames surrounding traumatic life events or ''manic episodes'' (if the individual is diagnosed with another mental disorder). The diagnosis for ASPD cannot be done before the age of 18.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|url=https://behavenet.com/node/21650|title=Diagnostic criteria for 301.7 Antisocial Personality Disorder|date=2018|website=Behave.net|via=American Psychiatric Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128165026/https://behavenet.com/node/21650|archive-date=28 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, someone who exhibits anti-social behaviour with their family but pro-social behaviour with friends and coworkers would not qualify for ASPD because the behaviour is not consistent across context. Someone who was consistently behaving in a pro-social way and then begins exhibiting anti-social behaviour in response to a specific life event would not qualify for ASPD either because the behaviour is not stable across time.

Law breaking behaviour in which the individuals are putting themselves or others at risk is considered anti-social even if it is not consistent or stable (Examples : speeding, use of drugs, getting in physical conflict). In relation to the previous statement, ''[[Juvenile delinquency in the United States|juvenile delinquency]]'' is a core element to the diagnosis of ASPD.<ref name=":02" /> Individuals who begin getting in trouble with the law (in more than one area) at an abnormally early age (around 15)<ref name=":12" /> and keep recurrently doing so in adulthood may be suspected of having ASPD.

=== Evidence: frustration and aggression ===
With some limitations, research has established a correlation between frustration and aggression when it comes to anti-social behaviour. The presence of anti-social behaviour may be detected when an individual is experiencing an abnormally high amount of frustrations in their daily life routine and when those frustrations always result into aggression.<ref name="Clarke_2003">{{cite book|title=Pro-Social and Anti-Social Behaviour|last=Clarke|first=David|date=July 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-58755-1|location=London|page=79|oclc=56615122|name-list-style=vanc}}</ref> The term ''[[impulsivity]]'' is commonly used to describe this behavioural pattern. Anti-social behaviour can also be detected if the aggressiveness and impulsiveness of the individual's behaviour in response to frustrations is so that it causes obstruction to social interactions and achievement of personal goals. In both of these cases, we can consider the different types of treatment and therapy previously mentioned in this article.<ref name="Clarke_2003" />
* Examples in childhood: unable to make friends, unable to follow rules, getting kicked out of school, unable to fulfill minimal levels of education (elementary school, middle school).
* Examples in early adulthood: unable to keep a job or an apartment, difficulty to maintain relationships.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis of having anti-social behaviour is not very favourable due to its high stability throughout children development.<ref name="Braet_2009" /> Studies have shown that children who are aggressive and have conduct problems are more likely to have anti-social behaviour in adolescence.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Coie JD, Dodge KA | year = 1998 | chapter = Aggression and antisocial behavior | title = Handbook of child psychology | volume = 3 Social, emotional, and personality development | edition = 5th | veditors = Damon W, Eisenberg N | pages = 779–863 | location = New York | publisher = Wiley }}</ref> Early intervention of anti-social behaviour is relatively more effective since the anti-social pattern lasts for a shorter period of time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Loeber R, Dishion T|date=July 1983|title=Early predictors of male delinquency: a review|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=94|issue=1|pages=68–99|pmid=6353467|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.94.1.68}}</ref> Moreover, since younger children would have smaller social networks and less social activities, fewer contexts need to be considered for the intervention and treatment.<ref name="Braet_2009" /> For adolescents, studies have shown that the influence of treatments becomes less effective.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kazdin AE | year = 1987 | title = Conduct disorders in childhood and adolescence | location = Newbury Park, CA | publisher = Sage }}</ref><ref name="Kazdin_1997">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kazdin AE | title = Practitioner review: psychosocial treatments for conduct disorder in children | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–78 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9232463 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1997.tb01851.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.471.1997 }}</ref>

The prognosis seems to not be influenced by the duration of intervention, however; a long-term follow-up is necessary to confirm that the intervention or treatment is effective.<ref name="Braet_2009" />

Individuals who exhibit anti-social behaviour are more likely to use drugs and [[alcohol abuse|abuse alcohol]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robins LN | title = The intimate connection between antisocial personality and substance abuse | journal = Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume = 33 | issue = 8 | pages = 393–9 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9708027 | doi = 10.1007/s001270050071 | s2cid = 7023036 }}</ref> This could make the prognosis worse since he or she would less likely be involved in social activities and would become more isolated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dualdiagnosis.org/antisocial-behavior-drug-addiction/|title=Antisocial Behavior and Drug Addiction: Dual Diagnosis|work=Dual Diagnosis|access-date=2018-03-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325110001/https://www.dualdiagnosis.org/antisocial-behavior-drug-addiction/|archivedate=25 March 2018}}</ref>

{{main|Anti-social behaviour order}}
[[File:Police asbo notice Richmond.jpg|thumb|ASBO warning in [[London]]]]
An anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) is a [[civil law (common law)|civil]] order made against a person who has been shown, on the balance of evidence, to have engaged in anti-social behaviour. The orders, introduced in the United Kingdom by Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in 1998,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6854451.ece |title=ASBOs can't beat a neighborhood policeman|date= 30 September 2009 |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |access-date=2014-04-29}}</ref> were designed to [[Criminalization|criminalize]] minor incidents that would not have warranted prosecution before.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1883277.stm |title=BBC Q&A Anti-social behaviour orders |work=BBC News |date=2002-03-20 |access-date=2014-04-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026012415/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1883277.stm |archivedate=26 October 2014}}</ref>
 
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 defines anti-social behaviour as acting in a manner that has "caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same [[household]]" as the perpetrator. There has been debate concerning the vagueness of this definition.<ref name=":5" />

However, among legal professionals in the UK there are behaviours commonly considered to fall under the definitions of anti-social behaviour. These include, but are not limited to, threatening or intimidating actions, racial or religious harassment, verbal abuse, and physical abuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chrisruddsolicitors.co.uk/our-services/disputes-litigation/neighbour-disputes/ |title=Neighbour Disputes - Chris Rudd Solicitors |last=Broady |first=Thomas |date= 15 January 2020 |website=chrisruddsolicitors.co.uk |access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>
 
In a survey conducted by [[University College London]] during May 2006, the UK was thought by respondents to be Europe's worst country for anti-social behaviour, with 76% believing Britain had a "big or moderate problem".<ref>{{cite news | first = Matt | last = Weaver | name-list-style = vanc | url = http://society.guardian.co.uk/crimeandpunishment/story/0,,1770881,00.html | title = UK 'has worst behaviour problem in Europe | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 9 May 2006 }}</ref>
 
Current legislation governing anti-social behaviour in the UK is the [[Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014]] which received Royal Assent in March 2014 and came into enforcement in October 2014. This replaces tools such as the ASBO with 6 streamlined tools designed to make it easier to act on anti-social behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|title=What the Law Says|url=http://www.asbhelp.co.uk/what-the-law-says|publisher=ASB Help|access-date=26 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129091341/http://asbhelp.co.uk/what-the-law-says/|archivedate=29 November 2014}}</ref>

=== Australia ===
Anti-social behaviour can have a negative effect and impact on [[Australia]]n communities and their perception of safety. The Western Australia Police force define anti-social behaviour as any behaviour that annoys, irritates, disturbs or interferes with a persons' ability to go about their lawful business.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Morgan A, McAtamney A | year = 2009 | title = Key Issues in Antisocial Behaviour | journal = Research in Practice | volume = 5 | page = 1 | issn = 1836-9111 | url = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/99764/20101103-1442/Drip05_001.pdf }}</ref> In Australia, many different acts are classed as anti-social behaviour such as, misuse of public space, disregard for community safety, disregard for personal well-being, acts directed at people, [[graffiti]], protests, liquor offences and drunk driving.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.crimestopperswa.com.au/crime-types/anti-social-behaviour/ | title = Anti-social behaviour | website = Crime Stoppers Western Australia | access-date = 2016-05-13 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160513205903/https://www.crimestopperswa.com.au/crime-types/anti-social-behaviour/ | archivedate = 13 May 2016}}</ref> It has been found that it is very common for Australian adolescents to engage in different levels of anti-social behaviour. &nbsp;A survey was conducted in 1996 in [[New South Wales]], Australia, of 441, 234 secondary school students in years 7 to 12 about their involvement in anti-social activities. 38.6% reported intentionally damaging or destroying someone else's property, 22.8% admitted to having received or selling stolen goods and close to 40% confessed to attacking someone with the idea of hurting them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aifs.gov.au/publications/patterns-and-precursors-adolescent-antisocial-behaviour/1-introduction|title=Patterns and precursors of adolescent antisocial behaviour|date=2002|website=Australian Institute of Family Studies|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617024229/https://aifs.gov.au/publications/patterns-and-precursors-adolescent-antisocial-behaviour/1-introduction|archive-date=17 June 2016|url-status=live|access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref> The Australian community are encouraged to report any behaviour of concern and play a vital role assisting police in reducing anti-social behaviour. One study conducted in 2016 established how perpetrators of anti-social behaviour may not actually intend to cause offense. The study examined anti-social behaviours (or microaggressions) within the [[LGBTIQ]] community on a university campus. The study established how many members felt that other people would often commit anti-social behaviours, however there was no explicit suggestion of any maliciousness behind these acts. Rather, it was just that the offenders were naive to the impact of their behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal | first1 = James A. | last1 = Roffee | first2 = Andrea Marjorie | last2 = Waling | s2cid = 151493252 | name-list-style = vanc | title = Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ Youth | doi = 10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | journal = Safer Communities | pages = 190–201 | year = 2016 }}</ref>

The Western Australia Police force uses a three-step strategy to deal with anti-social behaviour.

# Prevention – This action uses community engagement, intelligence, training and development and the targeting of hotspots, attempting to prevent unacceptable behaviour from occurring. 
# Response – A timely and effective response to anti-social behaviour is vital. Police provide ownership, leadership and coordination to apprehend offenders. 
# Resolution – Identifying the underlying issues that cause anti-social behaviour and resolve these issues with the help of the community. Offenders are successfully prosecuted.<ref>{{cite web | author = Western Australia Police | year = 2009 | title = Anti-social behaviour Strategy 2009-2011 | publisher = Frontline First | pages = 3–4 | url = http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/anti-social-behaviour-strategy-for-wilts.pdf | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160514042134/http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/anti-social-behaviour-strategy-for-wilts.pdf | archivedate = 14 May 2016}}</ref>
