Geithner, Paulson, and Bernanke later argued that Lehman's financial situation was too dire for the government to have legally rescued it.<ref name=nytlehman3>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/business/revisiting-the-lehman-brothers-bailout-that-never-was.html|title=Revisiting the Lehman Brothers Bailout That Never Was|access-date=July 9, 2016 |last1=Stewart |first1=James P. |last2=Eavis |first2=Peter |date=September 29, 2014 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> A team from [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Credit Suisse]] had estimated prior to Lehman's bankruptcy filing that Lehman's liabilities exceeded its assets by tens of billions of dollars (i.e., a negative [[net worth]]).<ref name=newyorker/>

Geithner was instrumental in government dealings with the [[American International Group]] (AIG) insurance company. Over the summer of 2008, as [[Credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]] downgraded [[mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]], AIG faced mounting demands to provide increased collateral to buyers of its [[credit default swap]]s. Consequently, by the time of Lehman's failure in September, AIG was facing a rapidly increasing multibillion-dollar capital shortfall. On September 13, AIG chief [[Robert B. Willumstad]] informed Geithner that the company would need to raise $40 billion and asked for government assistance in doing so. Geithner rejected the request for government funds and pressed AIG to find a private-sector solution to the company's [[liquidity crisis]]. On the morning of September, Geithner reiterated this decision at a meeting of Wall Street executives and requested that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan organize an industry-based solution. By that evening, private-sector appetite for an AIG rescue has dissipated. Later that night, a consensus emerged at the New York Fed that AIG, with $500 billion in troubled credit-swap obligations, could not be allowed to fail. At a meeting of the Federal Reserve in Washington the next day, Geithner and Paulson proposed lending $85 billion to AIG, with all of AIG's assets held as collateral, in exchange for a 79.9% [[equity (finance)|equity]] stake in AIG and veto rights over dividend payments. Upon delivering this offer to AIG, Geithner informed Willumstad that there would be "no negotiation".<ref name=newyorker/><ref name=Becker-Morgenstern /><ref name=nytlehman3/>

As a result of Lehman Brothers's failure, [[money market fund]]s with exposure to Lehman securities found themselves in distress on the day of Lehman's bankruptcy filing. One such fund was the [[Reserve Primary Fund]]. Due to the highly stable [[net asset value]] (NAV) of money market funds ($1.00 per share), money market funds were extensively relied on by companies for regular cash demands (e.g., payroll). Following Lehman's bankruptcy filing, due to a slowdown in credit markets, the Primary Fund was unable to sell once [[Market liquidity|liquid assets]] to meet rapidly mounting demands for the redemption of investments. Geithner's New York Fed had been informed of the worsening situation at 7:50 that morning, and the next day rebuffed a request from the Primary Fund to assist it in making payments.<ref name=newyorker/> Unable to sell Lehman's securities held by the fund, the board of the Primary Fund announced that it would freeze redemptions for seven days and reduce its NAV to $0.97 per share, meaning a money market fund would [[Money market fund#Breaking the buck|break the buck]] for only the second time in the industry's history.<ref name=marketwatchmoneymarket>{{cite news |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/money-market-fund-breaks-the-buck-freezes-redemptions|title=Money market breaks the buck, freezes redemptions|access-date=July 10, 2016 |last1=Mamudi |first1=Sam |last2=Burton |first2=Jonathan |date=September 17, 2008 |publisher=Marketwatch}}</ref>

To stabilize the financial market, Geithner proposed that the traditional [[investment bank]]s Goldman Sachs and [[Morgan Stanley]] transform themselves into [[bank holding company|bank holding companies]] to ensure continuing access to funding. Both banks completed the restructuring by September 21.<ref name=newyorker/><ref name=morganstanleypr>{{cite web |url=http://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/msdotcom/en/press-releases/morgan-stanley-granted-federal-bank-holding-company-status-by-us-federal-reserve-board-of-governors_6933.html |title=Morgan Stanley Granted Federal Bank Holding Company Status By U.S. Federal Reserve Board of Governors |access-date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>

Geithner believed, along with Paulson, that the Treasury needed new authority to respond to the financial crisis.<ref name=Cho2008/> Paulson described Geithner as a "very unusually talented young man...[who] understands government and understands markets".<ref name=timemag/>

===Bailouts===

Geithner had authority over the second [[tranche]] of $350 billion from the $700 billion banking [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|bailout bill]] passed by Congress in October 2008. Under the Financial Stability Plan, he proposed to create a new investment fund to provide a market for the legacy loans and securities—the so-called "[[toxic asset]]s"—burdening the financial system, using a mix of taxpayer and private money.<ref>{{cite news|title=My Plan for Bad Bank Assets|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123776536222709061 |date=2009-03-23 |author=Timothy Geithner |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref> He also proposed expanding a lending program that would spend as much as $1 trillion to cover the decline in the issuance of securities backed by consumer loans. He further proposed to give banks new infusions of capital with which to lend. In exchange, banks would be required to cut the [[Executive compensation|salaries and perks of executives]] and sharply limit [[dividends]] and [[Mergers and acquisitions|corporate acquisitions]].<ref>Brian Knowlton, "Geithner Is Pressed for Bailout Details," [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/business/economy/12treasury.html ''New York Times'' February 11, 2009]</ref><ref>E.

The [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) and [[Government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis#Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac|takeover]] of [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] amounted a combined outflow of $620.3 billion in Treasury funds in the form of spending, investments, and loans. As of July 2016, $689 billion has been returned to the Treasury, primarily in the form of refunds provided by bailed-out companies and revenue from dividends. This has earned the government a profit of $68.6 billion.<ref>https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/</ref>

====AIG bonuses====
{{Main|AIG bonus payments controversy}}
[[File:Barack Obama & Timothy Geithner on Air Force One 3-31-09.JPG|thumb|300px|Geithner and Obama aboard [[Air Force One]], 2009]]
Although President Obama expressed strong support for Geithner, outrage over hundreds of millions of dollars in [[bonus payment]]s (or [[employee retention|employee "retention"]] payments) by the [[American International Group]], which had received more than $170 billion in federal bailout aid, undermined public support in early 2009. In March 2009, AIG paid $165 million in bonuses to its financial products division, the unit responsible for the company's [[American International Group#Liquidity crisis and government bailout|near collapse]] the year prior, following $55 million paid to the same division in December 2008 and $121 million in bonus payments to senior executives.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/22/AR2009032201606.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Advisers To Obama Wary of Bonus Tax | first1=Michael A. | last1=Fletcher | first2=Anthony | last2=Faiola | date=March 23, 2009 | access-date=May 25, 2010}}</ref><ref name="nytaig">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/business/15AIG.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | title=A.I.G.

On March 11, 2009, Geithner called [[Ed Liddy]], the AIG chief, to protest the bonus payouts and request that the contracting containing the bonuses be renegotiated.<ref name="wsjaig">{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123777083390610069 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Geithner Aides Worked With AIG for Months on Bonuses | first1=Michael M. | last1=Phillips | first2=Sudeep | last2=Reddy | date=March 23, 2009}}</ref><ref name="nytaig2">{{cite news| url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/live-blogging-the-house-hearing-on-aig/ | work=DealBook (The New York Times) | title=Live-Blogging the House Hearing on A.I.G. | date=March 24, 2009}}</ref> Later in March, Liddy requested that employees who received bonuses of more than $100,000 return half of the payment.<ref name="cnnaig">{{cite news| url=https://money.cnn.com/2009/03/18/news/companies/aig_hearing/index.htm?postversion=2009031817 | work=CNN | title=Tug of war over AIG bonuses | first1=David | last1=Goldman | first2=Jennifer | last2=Liberto | date=March 18, 2009}}</ref> At Geithner's urging, Liddy cut $9.6 million in payments to company's top 50 executives in half and tied the remainder to performance.<ref name="nytaig"/>

====AIG payments to banks====
In November 2009, [[Neil Barofsky]], the Treasury Department Inspector General responsible for oversight of TARP funds, issued a report critical of the use of $62.1&nbsp;billion of government funds to redeem derivative contracts held by several large banks which AIG had insured against losses. The banks received face value for the contracts although their market value at the time was much lower. In the report, Barofsky said the payments "provided [the banks] with tens of billions of dollars they likely would have not otherwise received". Terms for use of the funds had been negotiated with the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|New York Federal Reserve Bank]] while Geithner was president.

In January 2010, Rep. [[Darrell Issa]] released a series of e-mails between AIG and the New York Fed. In these e-mails, the Fed urged AIG not to disclose the full details of the payments publicly or in its [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] filings. Issa pushed for an investigation of the matter, and for records and e-mails from the Fed to be subpoenaed. Rep. [[Edolphus Towns]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Oversight and Government Reform Committee]], issued subpoenas for the records and scheduled hearings for late January. [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve Chairman]] [[Ben Bernanke]] said the Fed would welcome a full review of its actions regarding the AIG payments.<ref>Liberto, Jennifer, [https://money.cnn.com/2010/01/19/news/economy/Fed_AIG/index.htm " Bernanke: Bring on AIG scrutiny"], ''[[CNNMoney.com]]'', January 19, 2010</ref><ref>Lawder, David and Felsenthal, Mark, [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60G0BV20100117 "New emails show AIG mulled bank payment disclosures"], ''[[Reuters]]'', January 17, 2010</ref><ref>Son, Hugh, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=afBRd2IifYuw "Geithner's Fed Told AIG to Limit Swaps Disclosure (Update3)",''Bloomberg Press'', January 7, 2010]</ref><ref>Son, Hugh, [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-16/paulson-asked-to-testify-at-aig-bailout-hearing-with-geithner.html "Paulson Asked to Testify at AIG Bailout Hearing With Geithner"], ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] Business Week'', January 16, 2010</ref>

Geithner and his predecessor, former Treasury Secretary [[Henry Paulson]], both appeared before the Committee on January 27. Geithner defended the bailout of AIG and the payments to the banks, while reiterating previous denials of any involvement in efforts to withhold details of the transactions. His testimony was met with skepticism and angry disagreement by House members of both parties.<ref>[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/tg514.htm "Secretary Written Testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127234649/http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/tg514.htm |date=2010-01-27 }}, ''[[United States Department of the Treasury]] Press Room'', January 27, 2010</ref><ref>Ng, Serena and Crittenden, Michael R., [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704094304575029050775285726?mod=rss_Today%27s_Most_Popular " Geithner Defends Big AIG Payouts"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', January 27, 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2613173720100127 "U.S. lawmakers turn up heat on Geithner over AIG"], January 28, 2010</ref><ref>DeCambre, Mark, [http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/geithner_aig_grilling_has_bipartisan_nbWbWC12x62LJHvbdoX1sO "Geithner AIG grilling has bipartisan fervor"], ''[[New York Post]]'', January 28, 2010</ref>

====Making Home Affordable====

In his book ''Bailout: How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street'', [[Neil Barofsky]] argues that Geithner never had the intention to utilize the [[Home Affordable Modification Program]] as intended by Congress. Instead of providing relief for homeowners to avoid foreclosures, it was Geithner's plan that the bank should proceed with these foreclosures. Geithner said that he "estimates" that the banks "can handle ten million foreclosures, over time", and that HAMP "will help foam the runway for them" by “keeping the full flush of foreclosures from hitting the financial system all at the same time." <ref>{{Cite book|last=Barofsky, Neil M.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793575355|title=Bailout : an inside account of how Washington abandoned Main Street while rescuing Wall Street|date=2012|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-1-4516-8493-3|location=New York|oclc=793575355}}</ref> As such, "banks participating in the program have rejected four million borrowers’ requests for help, or 72 percent of their applications, since the process began".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-08-09|title=Banks reject 72% of applicants under HAMP program|url=https://therealdeal.com/miami/2015/08/09/banks-reject-72-of-applicants-under-hamp-program/|access-date=2020-06-24|website=The Real Deal Miami|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Citigroup|Citimortgage]] and [[JPMorgan Chase]] were among the banks that refused the most HAMP claims.

In written comments to the Senate Finance Committee during his confirmation hearings, Geithner stated that the new administration believed [[People's Republic of China|China]] was "manipulating" [[Renminbi|its currency]] and that the Obama administration would act "aggressively" using "all the diplomatic avenues" to change China's currency practices.<ref name=manipulates>{{cite news |title=Geithner Says China Manipulates Its Currency |last=Montgomery |first=Lori; Faiola, Anthony |work=The Washington Post |date=January 23, 2009 |page=A08 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/22/AR2009012203796.html }}</ref> The Obama administration would pressure China diplomatically to change this practice more strongly than the [[George W.

Shortly after assuming his role as Secretary of the Treasury, Geithner met in Washington with Chinese Foreign Minister [[Yang Jiechi]]. He told Yang that the U.S. attached great importance to [[Sino-American relations|its relations with China]] and that U.S.–China cooperation was essential in order for the world economy to fully recover.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mfa.gov.cn/ce/celt/eng/xwdt/t542442.htm|title=Yang Jiechi Meets with U.S. Secretary of Treasury Geithner |publisher=Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs|date=March 12, 2009|access-date=February 23, 2010}}</ref>

On June 1, 2009, during a question-and-answer session following a speech at [[Peking University]], Geithner was asked by a student whether Chinese investments in U.S. Treasury debt were safe. His reply that they were "very safe" drew laughter from the audience.<ref>{{cite news|first=Glenn|last=Somerville|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINPEK12423320090601?rpc=44|title=Geithner backs strong dlr, says China's assets safe|publisher=Reuters|date=June 1, 2009|access-date=February 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Powell|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1902099,00.html|title=Geithner's Asia Background Shows on His China Trip|work=Time|date=June 1, 2009|access-date=February 23, 2010}}</ref>

Geithner co-chaired the high-profile [[U.S.–China Strategic and Economic Dialogue]] from July 27 to 28 in 2009 in Washington, D.C. and led the Economic Track for the U.S. side.

In September 2011, Geithner told a forum that China had "made possible systematic stealing of intellectual property of American companies and have not been very aggressive to put in place the basic protections for property rights that every serious economy needs over time", a rebuke of longstanding policy on the part of China to demand patents and other intellectual property from companies that sought to produce their products in China. He furthered that China was acting "very, very aggressive in a strategy they started several decades ago", which he defined as the ultimatum of transferring technology or being unable to produce products in China.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2011/09/geithner-china-stealing-us-ideas-064275|title=Geithner: China 'stealing' U.S. ideas|first=Tim|last=Mak|date=September 23, 2011|publisher=Politico}}</ref>

===Opposing extension of tax cuts===
In summer 2010, ''The New York Times'' said Geithner "is President Obama's point man in opposing the extension of the [[Bush tax cuts]] for the wealthy after their Dec. 31 expiration. ... [Geithner] has cited the projected $700 billion, 10-year cost of the tax cuts, and nonpartisan analyses that they do not stimulate the economy because the wealthy tend to save the additional money rather than spend it. 'I believe there is no credible argument to be made that the purpose of government is to borrow from future generations of Americans to finance an extension of tax cuts for the top 2 percent,' [he] said in a recent speech."<ref name="NYT01">Calmes, Jackie (August 19, 2010).

===Fiscal cliff and debt limit negotiations===
Geithner was Obama's lead negotiator about the [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]] and the increase in the 2013 [[debt limit]].<ref name="Nov 30 2012 T.G. neg">{{cite web|title=Republicans Unhappy With Latest Fiscal Cliff Talks|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/11/republicans-unhappy-with-latest-fiscal-cliff-talks.html|publisher=PBS NewsHour|access-date=30 November 2012|author=Terence Burlij|author2=Katelyn Polantz|date=November 30, 2012 <!-- at 8:54 AM EDT --> }}</ref><ref name="TNT Nov 2012 Fiscal Cliff">{{cite journal|last=Gleeson|first=Michael M.|author2=McPherson, Lindsey M.|title=2012 TNT 231-3 REPUBLICANS CALL ADMINISTRATION'S FISCAL CLIFF PLAN 'UNREASONABLE'.

===Criticism===
Geithner weathered criticism early in the Obama presidency, when Congressman [[Connie Mack IV|Connie Mack]] (R-FL) suggested he should resign over the AIG bonus scandal, and Alabama Senator [[Richard Shelby]] said that Geithner was "out of the loop". Democrats largely joined Obama in supporting Geithner, and there was no serious talk of him losing his job.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/03/18/should-geithner-resign/|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=March 18, 2009|title=Should Geithner Resign?|first=Susan|last=Davis}}</ref>

In November 2009, Oregon Representative [[Peter DeFazio]], speaking for himself and some fellow members of the Progressive Caucus, suggested that both Geithner and [[Lawrence Summers]], the director of the [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council]], should be fired in order to curtail [[unemployment]] and signal a new direction for the Obama administration's fiscal policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wegoted.com/news/detail.asp?newsID=2720|publisher=[[The Ed Schultz Show]]|title=Rep.

Liberals are growing in that consensus as well. Poll after poll shows the public has lost confidence in this president's ability to handle the economy. For the sake of our jobs, will you step down from your post?" Geithner defended his record, suggesting Brady was misrepresenting the situation and overestimating popular disapproval of his job performance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kbtx.com/national/headlines/70530807.html|publisher=KBTX-TV|location=Bryan – College Station, TX|title=Brady to Geithner: 'Will You Step Down?{{'-}}|date=November 19, 2009|access-date=July 24, 2011|first=Steve|last=Fullhart|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229134616/http://www.kbtx.com/national/headlines/70530807.html|archive-date=February 29, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In June 2011, ''[[The New Republic]]'' criticized Geithner from the left, arguing that he was and is overly concerned with the deficit at a time when, following the [[Great Recession]], the government should be pursuing stimulus; and as a result, it is possible that the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act|stimulus]] was smaller than it could have been.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/89627/tim-geithner-debt-deficit|work=[[The New Republic]]|title=Why Tim Geithner's Obsession With Deficits Is Hurting The Economy|date=June 9, 2011|author-link=John B.

In July 2018, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' revealed that Mariner Finance, a company owned by the private equity firm of which Geithner is President, engaged in predatory lending behavior; capturing the sentiments of many former employees of Mariner Finance interviewed by ''The Post'', a former manager trainee at a Mariner Finance branch in Nashville characterized the company's business model as "a way of monetizing poor people".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-way-of-monetizing-poor-people-how-private-equity-firms-make-money-offering-loans-to-cash-strapped-americans/2018/07/01/5f7e2670-5dee-11e8-9ee3-49d6d4814c4c_story.html|title='A way of monetizing poor people': How private equity firms make money offering loans to cash-strapped Americans|date=1 July 2018|website=The Washington Post|quote=‘A way of monetizing poor people’: How private equity firms make money offering loans to cash-strapped Americans}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Private equity firms are the new predatory lenders: Report |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/private-equity-firms-are-the-new-predatory-lenders-report/ |access-date=27 May 2019 |work=www.cbsnews.com |date=9 July 2018}}</ref>
