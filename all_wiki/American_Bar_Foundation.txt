== Research Programs ==
The American Bar Foundation's research is organized under three categories:

* Learning and practicing law
*Protecting rights and accessing justice
*Making and implementing Law

Research at the American Bar Foundation is implemented through projects designed and conducted by a group of resident Research Faculty. These projects are undertaken following review by an external review body (The Wheeler Committee) and the American Bar Foundation Board of Directors.

The American Bar Foundation disseminates its research findings to the organized bar, scholars, and the public. The results of this research are published in academic journals, law reviews, and academic and commercial presses.

Research projects conducted at the American Bar Foundation cover issues related to civil justice, criminal justice, law and globalization, legal history, diversity and law, legal education and the legal profession, and social justice. Current projects include:

*Access to Justice: This project is intended to bridge the gap between the accessibility of civil legal services and the widespread civil justice problems many Americans. Findings from this significant research have provided knowledge about how civil justice issues impact different communities and how to make civil legal aid more accessible to the people who need it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbarfoundation.org/research/project/106|title=Access to Justice - American Bar Foundation|website=www.americanbarfoundation.org|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>
* Criminal Defense in China: This project was funded by the National Science Foundation and explores the development of criminal procedure law and practice in China, specifically revealing the Chinese government's increasing disregard for the rule of law and human rights. Principal findings from this research were published in the 2016 book ''Criminal Defense in China: The Politics of Lawyers at Work'' by ABF Research Professor Terence Halliday and ABF Faculty Fellow and Assistant Professor of Sociology and Law at the University of Toronto, Sida Liu.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbarfoundation.org/research/project/59|title=Criminal Defense in China - American Bar Foundation|website=www.americanbarfoundation.org|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> ''Criminal Defense in China'' was reviewed in the August 2017 issue of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.<ref>https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/08/17/china-when-law-meets-party/</ref> 
* After the JD: This project follows a large national sample of lawyers admitted to the bar in 2000 over the first decade and more of their careers and is a source of information on the changing nature of legal careers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbarfoundation.org/research/project/118|title=After the JD - American Bar Foundation|website=www.americanbarfoundation.org|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>
*Surrogate De cision-making at the End of Life: An Observational Study: This project investigates the most significant "life-and-death" decisions made by others who act on behalf of those who are not competent to make their own medical decisions. The study involves the interaction of patient families with health care providers, day after day, in two demographically diverse intensive care units in a large urban teaching hospital. Systematic data has been gathered on patient medical histories, the medical issues and decisions they face, and the interventions made on their behalf. Data on more than one thousand encounters and family meetings between almost 300 health care providers and more than 600 friends, family and significant others of 205 patients without decision-making capacity has been collected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbarfoundation.org/research/project/50|title=Surrogate Decisionmaking at the End of Life: An Observational Study - American Bar Foundation|website=www.americanbarfoundation.org|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>
* Future of Latinos in the United States: Law, Opportunity and Mobility: A nation-wide, interdisciplinary research initiative devoted to understanding the current condition of Latinos in the United States, the structural barriers that prevent full equality and integration for this emerging population, and the sites of intervention that promise to be the most impactful in promoting opportunity and mobility through law and policy. The project's mission is to ensure that the Latino population flourishes by generating findings that can be converted into concrete recommendations for reform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbarfoundation.org/research/project/104|title=The Future of Latinos in the United States: Law, Opportunity, and Mobility - American Bar Foundation|website=www.americanbarfoundation.org|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>

''LSI'' examines criminology, economics, history, law, philosophy, political science, sociology and social psychology. Recent ''LSI'' articles have been awarded numerous distinctions, among them the prestigious Law & Society Association Article Prize. ''LSI'' regularly features symposia, or a series of manuscripts centered on a specific sociolegal theme. In addition to its high quality of original research, ''LSI'' is widely known for its review essays. Review essays are article-length treatments of a book or group of books that situate them within their greater intellectual context and engage with relevant discourse, focusing on the bigger questions the books evoke. Each issue of the journal also includes "book notes" that present brief descriptions of twenty or thirty recently published books of interest to those working in the field of law or the social sciences. ''LSI'' also holds an annual student paper competition for graduate and law students, which includes a monetary prize and publication of the winning paper. ''LSI''{{'}}s mission is to publish the best sociolegal scholarship from around the world. American Bar Foundation scholars play a critical role in achieving this goal through their service as editors and peer reviewers of the magazine, as well as authors published in the magazine. The American Bar Foundation partnered with [[Cambridge University Press]] to begin publishing ''LSI'' in January 2019. The journal was formerly published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]].
