American sociologist Kathleen Shaputis labeled millennials as the ''[[Boomerang Generation]]'' or ''[[Peter Pan]] Generation'' because of the members' perceived tendency for delaying some [[rites of passage]] into adulthood for longer periods than most generations before them. These labels were also a reference to a trend toward members living with their parents for longer periods than previous generations.<ref name="Shaputis">Shaputis, Kathleen (2004).

Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe argue that each generation has common characteristics that give it a specific character with four basic generational archetypes, repeating in a cycle. According to their hypothesis, they predicted millennials would become more like the "civic-minded" [[Greatest Generation|G.I. Generation]] with a strong sense of community both local and global.<ref name="Strauss 2000 370" /> Strauss and Howe ascribe seven basic traits to the millennial cohort: special, sheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, and achieving. However, Arthur E. Levine, author of ''When Hope and Fear Collide: A Portrait of Today's College Student'', dismissed these generational images as "stereotypes".<ref name="Hoover" >{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Hoover |title=The Millennial Muddle: How stereotyping students became a thriving industry and a bundle of contradictions |date=11 October 2009 |url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Millennial-Muddle-How/48772/ |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |access-date=21 December 2010}}</ref> In addition, psychologist Jean Twenge says Strauss and Howe's assertions are overly-deterministic, non-falsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence.<ref name="auto"/>

Polling agency [[Ipsos MORI|Ipsos-MORI]] warned that the word 'millennials' is "misused to the point where it’s often mistaken for just another meaningless buzzword" because "many of the claims made about millennial characteristics are simplified, misinterpreted or just plain wrong, which can mean real differences get lost," and that "[e]qually important are the similarities between other generations—the attitudes and behaviors that are staying the same are sometimes just as important and surprising."<ref name=":36" />

Contrary to common misconception, millennials respond rather well to conventional marketing, even as their consumption patterns change, for example because they have more debt and are less likely to commit.<ref>{{Cite news|date=October 4, 2018|title=Established firms try dancing to a millennial tune|work=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/business/2018/10/04/established-firms-try-dancing-to-a-millennial-tune|access-date=November 17, 2020}}</ref>

== Cognitive abilities ==
Intelligence researcher [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]] discovered that back in the 1950s, the gap between the vocabulary levels of adults and children was much smaller than it is in the early twenty-first century. Between 1953 and 2006, adult gains on the vocabulary subtest of the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|Wechsler IQ test]] were 17.4 points whereas the corresponding gains [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|for children]] were only 4. He asserted that some of the reasons for this are the surge in interest in higher education and cultural changes. The number of Americans pursuing tertiary qualifications and cognitively demanding jobs has risen significantly since the 1950s. This boosted the level of vocabulary among adults. Back in the 1950s, children generally imitated their parents and adopted their vocabulary. This was no longer the case in the 2000s, when teenagers often developed their own subculture and as such were less likely to use adult-level vocabulary on their essays.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gambino|first=Megan|date=December 3, 2012|title=Are You Smarter Than Your Grandfather? Probably Not.|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/are-you-smarter-than-your-grandfather-probably-not-150402883/|access-date=October 22, 2020|website=Smithsonian Magazine}}</ref>

In a 2009 report, Flynn analyzed the results of the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]] test for British fourteen-year-olds from 1980 to 2008. He discovered that their average IQ had dropped by more than two points during that time period. Among those in the higher half of the intelligence distribution, the decline was even more significant, six points. This is a clear case of the reversal of the [[Flynn effect]], the apparent rise in IQ scores observed during the twentieth century. Flynn suspected that this was due to changes in British youth culture. He further noted that in the past, IQ gains had been correlated with socioeconomic class, but this was no longer true.<ref name="RPM UK">{{Cite news|last=Gray|first=Richard|date=7 February 2009|title=British teenagers have lower IQs than their counterparts did 30 years ago|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/4548943/British-teenagers-have-lower-IQs-than-their-counterparts-did-30-years-ago.html|url-status=live|access-date=19 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109041719/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/4548943/British-teenagers-have-lower-IQs-than-their-counterparts-did-30-years-ago.html|archive-date=9 November 2020}}</ref>

Psychologists Jean Twenge, W. Keith Campbell, and Ryne A. Sherman analyzed vocabulary test scores on the U.S. [[General Social Survey]] (<math>n = 29,912</math>) and found that after correcting for education, the use of sophisticated vocabulary has declined between the mid-1970s and the mid-2010s across all levels of education, from below high school to graduate school. Those with at least a bachelor's degree saw the steepest decline. Hence the gap between people who never received a high-school diploma and a university graduate has shrunk, from an average of 3.4 correct answers in the mid- to late-1970s to 2.9 in the early- to mid-2010s. Higher education offers little to no benefits to verbal ability. Because those with only a moderate level of vocabulary were more likely to be admitted to university than in the past, the average for degree holders declined. There are various explanations for this. Accepting high levels of immigrants, many of whom not particularly proficient in the English language, could lower the national adult average. Young people nowadays are much less likely to read for pleasure, thus reducing their levels of vocabulary. On the other hand, while the College Board has reported that SAT verbal scores were on the decline, these scores are an imperfect measure of the vocabulary level of the nation as a whole because the test-taking demographic has changed and because more students take the SAT in the 2010s then in the 1970s, which means there are more with limited ability who took it. Population aging is unconvincing because the effect is too weak.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Twenge|first1=Jean|last2=Campbell|first2=W.

[[File:Cute girl reading outdoors.jpg|left|thumb|A young woman reading outdoors in New York (2009).]]
A 2007 report by the National Endowment of the Arts stated that as a group, American adults were reading for pleasure less often than before. In particular, Americans aged 15 to 24 spent an average of two hours watching television and only seven on reading. In 2002, only 52% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 voluntarily read books, down from 59% in 1992. Reading comprehension skills of American adults of all levels of education have deteriorated between the early 1990s and the early 2000s, especially among those with advanced degrees. According to employers almost three quarters of university graduates were "deficient" in English writing skills.

Fred Bonner, a Samuel DeWitt Proctor Chair in Education at [[Rutgers University]] and author of ''Diverse Millennial Students in College: Implications for Faculty and Student Affairs'', believes that much of the commentary on the Millennial Generation may be partially correct, but overly general and that many of the traits they describe apply primarily to "white, affluent teenagers who accomplish great things as they grow up in the suburbs, who confront anxiety when applying to super-selective colleges, and who multitask with ease as their [[helicopter parents]] hover reassuringly above them." During class discussions, Bonner listened to black and Hispanic students describe how some or all of the so-called core traits did not apply to them. They often said that the "special" trait, in particular, is unrecognizable. Other socioeconomic groups often do not display the same attributes commonly attributed to millennials. "It's not that many diverse parents don't want to treat their kids as special," he says, "but they often don't have the [[social capital|social]] and [[cultural capital]], the time and resources, to do that."<ref name="Hoover" />

By the late 2010s, viewership of late-night American television among adults aged 18 to 49, the most important demographic group for advertisers, has fallen substantially despite an abundance of materials. This is due in part to the availability and popularity of streaming services. However, when delayed viewing within three days is taken into account, the top shows all saw their viewership numbers boosted. This development undermines the current business model of the television entertainment industry. "If the sky isn't exactly falling on the broadcast TV advertising model, it certainly seems to be a lot closer to the ground than it once was," wrote reporter Anthony Crupi for ''Ad Age''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/media/late-night-ratings/index.html|title=Trump is giving late night TV plenty to talk about.

Having faced the full brunt of the Great Recession, Millennials in Europe tended to be pessimistic about the future direction of their countries, though there were significant differences, the Pew Research Center found in 2014.

Once a highly successful genre on radio and then television, [[soap opera]]s—characterized by melodramatic plots focused on interpersonal affairs and cheap production value—has been declining in viewership since the 1990s.

From about 1750 to 1950, [[Western Europe]] transitioned from having both high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates. By the late 1960s and 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a "correction," such a rebound never came. Despite a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and [[Scandinavia]], they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. At first, falling fertility is due to [[urbanization]] and decreased [[infant mortality]] rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist [[Gary Becker]] argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural [[elite]]s. (This is the [[Demographic transition#Second demographic transition|second demographic transition]].) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility. Member states of the [[European Economic Community]] saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the [[Developed country|industrialized world]] found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed.<ref name=":23">{{Cite book|title=Whither the Child?

At the start of the twenty-first century, Europe suffers from an [[Population ageing|aging population]]. This problem is especially acute in [[Eastern Europe]], whereas in Western Europe, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been born to non-European parents. Because children of immigrants in Europe tend to be about as religious as they are, this could slow the decline of religion (or the growth of [[secularism]]) in the continent as the twenty-first century progresses.<ref name=":21">{{Cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Kaufmann|date=Winter 2010|title=Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?|journal=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review|volume=99|issue=396, the future of religion|pages=387–94|jstor=27896504}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the number of foreign-born residents stood at 6% of the population in 1991. Immigration subsequently surged and has not fallen since (as of 2018). Researches by the demographers and political scientists [[Eric Kaufmann]], [[Roger Eatwell]], and [[Matthew Goodwin]] suggest that such a fast ethno-demographic change is one of the key reasons behind public backlash in the form of [[Right-wing populism|national populism]] across the rich liberal democracies, an example of which is the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] (Brexit).<ref name=":20" />

Italy is a country where the problem of an aging population is especially acute. The fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having many children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the [[Great Recession]] of 2007–08, with the [[youth unemployment]] rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad—150,000 did in 2018—and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them. Only Japan has an age structure more tilted towards the elderly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-italy-rising-anxiety-over-falling-birth-rates|title=In Italy, rising anxiety over falling birth rates|last=Livesay|first=Christopher|date=November 25, 2019|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref>

Australia's total fertility rate has fallen from above three in the post-war era, to about replacement level (2.1) in the 1970s to below that in the late 2010s. However, immigration has been offsetting the effects of a declining birthrate. In the 2010s, among the residents of Australia, 5% were born in the United Kingdom, 3% from China, 2% from India, and 1% from the Philippines. 84% of new arrivals in the fiscal year of 2016 were below 40 years of age, compared to 54% of those already in the country. Like other immigrant-friendly countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Australia's working-age population is expected to grow till about 2025. However, the ratio of people of working age to retirees (the [[dependency ratio]]) has gone from eight in the 1970s to about four in the 2010s. It could drop to two by the 2060s, depending in immigration levels.<ref name=":25">{{Cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/australia-demographic-time-bomb-arrived-193400024.html|title=Australia's Demographic 'Time Bomb' Has Arrived|last=Fensom|first=Anthony|date=December 1, 2019|work=The National Interest|access-date=December 24, 2019|publisher=Yahoo!

Historically, the early Anglo-Protestant settlers in the seventeenth century were the most successful group, culturally, economically, and politically, and they maintained their dominance till the early twentieth century. Commitment to the ideals of the Enlightenment meant that they sought to assimilate newcomers from outside of the [[British Isles]], but few were interested in adopting a pan-European identity for the nation, much less turning it into a global melting pot. But in the early 1900s, liberal progressives and modernists began promoting more inclusive ideals for what the national identity of the United States should be. While the more traditionalist segments of society continued to maintain their Anglo-Protestant ethnocultural traditions, universalism and cosmopolitanism started gaining favor among the elites. These ideals became institutionalized after the Second World War, and ethnic minorities started moving towards institutional parity with the once dominant Anglo-Protestants.<ref name=":05">{{Cite journal|last=Varzally|first=Allison|date=2005|title=Book Review: The Rise and Fall of Anglo-America|url=https://www.sneps.net/research-interests/the-rise-and-fall-of-anglo-america-the-decline-of-dominant-ethnicity-in-the-united-states/the-rise-and-fall-of-anglo-america-review|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=92|issue=2|pages=680–81|doi=10.2307/3659399|jstor=3659399}}</ref> The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] (also known as the Hart-Cellar Act), passed at the urging of President Lyndon B.

On the other hand, 11% of Baby Boomer women gave birth to at least four children each, for a grand total of one quarter of the Millennial generation.

By analyzing data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Pew Research Center estimated that millennials, whom they define as people born between 1981 and 1996, outnumbered baby boomers, born from 1946 to 1964, for the first time in 2019. That year, there were 72.1 million millennials compared to 71.6 million baby boomers, who had previously been the largest living adult generation in the country. Data from the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] shows that about 62 million millennials were born in the United States, compared to 55 million members of Generation X, 76 million baby boomers, and 47 million from the Silent Generation. Between 1981 and 1996, an average of 3.6 babies (millennials) were born each year, compared to 3.4 million (Generation X) between 1965 and 1980. But millennials continue to grow in numbers as a result of immigration and naturalization. In fact, millennials form the largest group of immigrants to the United States in the 2010s. Pew projected that the millennial generation would reach around 74.9 million in 2033, after which mortality would outweigh immigration.<ref name="2020Overtake">{{Cite web|last=Fry|first=Richard|date=April 28, 2020|title=Millennials overtake Baby Boomers as America's largest generation|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/28/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers-as-americas-largest-generation/|access-date=April 28, 2020|website=Pew Research Center}}</ref> Yet 2020 would be the first time millennials (who are between the ages of 24 and 39) find their share of the electorate shrink as the leading wave of Generation Z (aged 18 to 23) became eligible to vote. In other words, their electoral power peaked in 2016. In absolute terms, however, the number of foreign-born millennials continues to increase as they become naturalized citizens. In fact, 10% of American voters were born outside the country by the 2020 election, up from 6% in 2000. The fact that people from different racial or age groups vote differently means that this demographic change will influence the future of the American political landscape. While younger voters hold significantly different views from their elders, they are considerably less likely to vote. Non-whites tend to favor candidates from the Democratic Party while whites by and large prefer the Republican Party.<ref>{{Cite web|title=An early look at the 2020 electorate|url=https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/an-early-look-at-the-2020-electorate/|last1=Cilluffo|first1=Anthony|last2=Fry|first2=Richard|date=January 30, 2019|website=Pew Research Center|access-date=May 8, 2020}}</ref>

As of the mid-2010s, the United States is one of the few developed countries that does ''not'' have a top-heavy population pyramid. In fact, as of 2016, the median age of the U.S. population was younger than that of all other rich nations except Australia, New Zealand, Cyprus, Ireland, and Iceland, whose combined population is only a fraction of the United States. This is because American baby boomers had a higher fertility rate compared to their counterparts from much of the developed world. Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Korea are all aging rapidly by comparison because their millennials are smaller in number than their parents. This demographic reality puts the United States at an advantage compared to many other major economies as the millennials reach middle age: the nation will still have a significant number of consumers, investors, and taxpayers.<ref name=":410" />

According to the International Labor Organization ([[International Labour Organization|ILO]]), 200&nbsp;million people were unemployed in 2015. Of these, 73.3&nbsp;million (37%) were 15 and 24 years of age. Between 2009 and 2015, youth unemployment increased considerably in the North Africa and the Middle East, and slightly in East Asia. During the same period, it fell noticeably in Europe (both within and without the E.U.), and the rest of the developed world, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, but remained steady in South Asia. The ILO estimated that some 475&nbsp;million jobs will need to be created worldwide by the mid-2020s in order to appreciably reduce the number of unemployed youths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/3-ways-we-can-tackle-youth-employment|title=3 ways we can tackle youth employment|last=Ryder|first=Guy|date=January 20, 2016|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=October 28, 2019}}</ref>

During the first two decades of the twenty-first century, right before the 2020 global pneumonia pandemic, economic activities tended to concentrate in the large metropolitan areas, such as San Francisco, New York, London, Tokyo and Sydney. Productivity increased enormously as knowledge workers agglomerated. But in the aftermath of the pandemic, more and more firms shifted towards remote working in order to minimize the health risks for their employees. The stigma of working from home faded somewhat. Moreover, while the shift can be uncomfortable, modern technology makes it a lot easier. However, the shift to working from home occurs rather unevenly. It is more popular in the Anglosphere than in Continental Europe, for instance.<ref>{{Cite news|date=October 8, 2020|title=Zoom and gloom|work=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/10/08/zoom-and-gloom|access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref>

Using a variety of measures, economists have reached the conclusion that the rate of innovation and entrepreneurship has been declining across the Western world between the early 1990s and early 2010s, when it leveled of. In the case of the U.S., one of the most complex economies in existence, economist Nicholas Kozeniauskas explained that "the decline in entrepreneurship is concentrated among the smart" as the share of entrepreneurs with university degrees in that country more than halved between the mid-1980s and the mid-2010s. There are many possible reasons for this: population aging, market concentration, and zombie firms (those with low productivity but are kept alive by subsidies). While employment have become more stable and more suitable, modern economies are so complex they are essentially ossified, making them vulnerable to disruptions.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Naudé|first=Wim|date=October 8, 2019|title=The surprising decline of entrepreneurship and innovation in the West|work=The Conversation|url=https://theconversation.com/the-surprising-decline-of-entrepreneurship-and-innovation-in-the-west-124552|access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref>

Key to China's 'economic miracle' was its one-child policy, which curbed population growth and enabled the economy to industrialize rapidly. Yet the policy has also led to population aging. Political economist and demographer [[Nicholas Eberstadt]] argued that China's working population peaked in 2014. Even so, economist [[Brad W. Setser|Brad Setser]] suggested that China can still increase its GDP per capita by raising the age of retirement and making it easier for people to migrate from rural to urban areas. But social scientist Wang Feng warned that as the population ages, social welfare spending as a share of GDP will also grow, intensifying sociopolitical problems.<ref>{{Cite news|last=LeVine|first=Steve|date=July 3, 2019|title=Demographics may decide the U.S-China rivalry|work=Axios|department=World|url=https://www.axios.com/demographics-decide-us-china-rivalry-64ef68fb-b34e-4216-870b-0a6cf0d8b946.html|access-date=July 20, 2020}}</ref> During the mid-2010s, China had five workers for every retiree.

A variety of names have emerged in various European countries hard hit following the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] to designate young people with limited employment and career prospects.<ref name="Itano">{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/europe/090514/greece-education-isnt-the-answer|title=In Greece, education isn't the answer|last=Itano|first=Nicole|date=14 May 2009|newspaper=[[Global Post]]|access-date=28 January 2013}}</ref> These groups can be considered to be more or less synonymous with millennials, or at least major sub-groups in those countries. ''The Generation of €700'' is a term popularized by the [[Media in Greece#Mass media|Greek mass media]] and refers to educated [[Greek people|Greek]] [[twixter]]s of urban centers who generally fail to establish a [[career]]. In Greece, young adults are being "excluded from the labor market" and some "leave their country of origin to look for better options". They are being "marginalized and face uncertain working conditions" in jobs that are unrelated to their educational background, and receive the minimum allowable base [[salary]] of €700 per month. This generation evolved in circumstances leading to the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek debt crisis]] and some participated in the [[Anti-austerity movement in Greece|2010–2011 Greek protests]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15117098,00.html|title=Γενιά των 600&nbsp;€ και "αγανακτισμένοι" της Μαδρίτης – βίοι παράλληλοι; – Πολιτική|date=30 May 2011|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}</ref> In Spain, they are referred to as the ''mileurista'' (for €1,000 per month),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/03/12/inenglish/1331575980_208983.html|title=1,000 euros a month?

Greek millennials benefit from tuition-free universities but suffer from their government's mishandling of taxes and excessive borrowing. Greek youths typically look for a career in finance in the United Kingdom, medicine in Germany, engineering in the [[Middle East]], and information technology in the United States. Many also seek advanced degrees abroad in order to ease the visa application process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/10/the-life-of-greeces-young-when-50000-of-loans-in-america-beats-a-life-back-home/|title=The life of Greece's young: When $50,000 of loans in America beats a life back home|last=Harlan|first=Chico|date=July 10, 2015|work=The Washington Post|access-date=January 21, 2020|department=Europe}}</ref>

In 2016, research from the [[Resolution Foundation]] found millennials in the United Kingdom earned £8,000 less in their 20s than Generation X, describing millennials as "on course to become the first generation to earn less than the one before".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/millennials-screwed_uk_578c7bc7e4b0f4bc59476263|title=Millennials 'Will Earn Less Than Generation X', And They'll Spend Far More On Rent|last1=York|first1=Chris|date=18 July 2016|work=Huffington Post|access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/stagnation-generation-the-case-for-renewing-the-intergenerational-contract/|title=Stagnation Generation: the case for renewing the intergenerational contract|last1=Gardiner|first1=Laura|date=18 July 2016|access-date=18 July 2016|publisher=Resolution Foundation}}</ref>

Millennials are the most highly educated and culturally diverse group of all generations, and have been regarded as hard to please when it comes to employers.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2013/03/07/7-surprising-ways-to-motivate-millennial-workers/#27d2e85b4ed9|title=7 Surprising Ways To Motivate Millennial Workers|last=Goudreau|first=Jenna}}</ref> To address these new challenges, many large firms are currently studying the social and behavioral patterns of millennials and are trying to devise programs that decrease intergenerational estrangement, and increase relationships of reciprocal understanding between older employees and millennials. The UK's [[Institute of Leadership & Management]] researched the gap in understanding between millennial recruits and their managers in collaboration with [[Ashridge Business School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.i-l-m.com/research-and-comment/generationy.aspx|title=Great Expectations: Managing Generation Y, 2011|date=8 July 2011|publisher=I-l-m.com|access-date=2 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105120843/http://www.i-l-m.com/research-and-comment/generationy.aspx|archive-date=5 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The findings included high expectations for advancement, salary and for a coaching relationship with their manager, and suggested that organizations will need to adapt to accommodate and make the best use of millennials. In an example of a company trying to do just this, [[Goldman Sachs]] conducted training programs that used actors to portray millennials who assertively sought more [[feedback]], [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], and involvement in decision making. After the performance, employees discussed and debated the generational differences which they saw played out.<ref name="Alsop08" /> In 2014, millennials were entering an increasingly multi-generational workplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2005-11-06-gen-y_x.htm|title=Generation Y: They've arrived at work with a new attitude|last=Armour|first=Stephanie|date=8 November 2005|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=8 May 2014}}</ref> Even though research has shown that millennials are joining the workforce during a tough economic time, they still have remained optimistic, as shown when about nine out of ten millennials surveyed by the [[Pew Research Center]] said that they currently have enough money or that they will eventually reach their long-term financial goals.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/02/24/millennials-confident-connected-open-to-change/|title=Millennials: Confident.

Statistics from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) reveal that between 2014 and 2019, unemployment rates fell in most of the world's major economies, many of which in Europe. Although the unemployment rates of France and Italy remained relatively high, they were markedly lower than previously. Meanwhile, the German unemployment rate dipped below even that of the United States, a level not seen since the [[German reunification]] almost three decades prior.<ref name=":122"/> [[Eurostat]] reported in 2019 that overall unemployment rate across the European Union dropped to its lowest level since January 2000, at 6% in August, meaning about 15.4&nbsp;million people were out of a job. The Czech Republic (3%), Germany (3%) and Malta (3%) enjoyed the lowest levels of unemployment. Member states with the highest unemployment rates were Italy (10%), Spain (14%), and Greece (17%). Countries with higher unemployment rates compared to 2018 were Denmark (from 4.9% to 5%), Lithuania (6% to 7%), and Sweden (3% to 7%).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.euronews.com/2019/09/30/eu-unemployment-drops-to-lowest-level-in-nearly-two-decades-eurostat|title=EU unemployment drops to lowest level in nearly two decades: Eurostat|date=October 1, 2019|work=Euronews|access-date=October 18, 2019}}</ref>

In November 2019, the [[European Commission]] expressed concern over the fact that some member states have "failed to put their finances in order." Belgium, France, and Spain had a [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] of almost 100% each while Italy's was 136%. Under E.U. rules, member nations must take steps to decrease public debt if it exceeds 60% of GDP. The Commission commended Greece for making progress in economic recovery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/economic-governance/news/eu-concerned-over-france-italy-and-spain-debts/|title=EU concerned over France, Italy and Spain debts|last=Rios|first=Beatriz|date=December 3, 2019|work=Euroactiv|access-date=January 4, 2020}}</ref>
[[File:Top EU Skill Shortages.png|thumb|342x342px|Top five professions with insufficient workers in the European Union in the late 2010s.]]
According to the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training ([[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training|Cedefop]]), the [[European Union]] in the late 2010s suffers from shortages of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]) specialists (including information and communications technology ([[Information and communications technology|ICT]]) professionals), medical doctors, nurses, midwives and schoolteachers. However, the picture varies depending on the country. In Italy, environmentally friendly architecture is in high demand. Estonia and France are running short of legal professionals. Ireland, Luxembourg, Hungary, and the United Kingdom need more financial experts. All member states except Finland need more ICT specialists, and all but Belgium, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and the United Kingdom need more teachers. The supply of STEM graduates has been insufficient because the [[Dropping out|dropout rate]] is high and because of an ongoing brain drain from some countries. Some countries need more teachers because many are retiring and need to be replaced. At the same time, Europe's aging population necessitates the expansion of the healthcare sector. Disincentives for (potential) workers in jobs in high demand include low social prestige, low salaries, and stressful work environments. Indeed, many have left the public sector for industry while some STEM graduates have taken non-STEM jobs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/news/skill-shortages-europe-which-occupations-are-demand-and-why|title=Skill shortages in Europe: Which occupations are in demand – and why|date=October 25, 2016|website=Cedefop|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref>

Spanish think-tank Fedea noted that there were way too few young Europeans enrolled in vocational programs that teach them skills favored by the job market. Many new entrants to the workforce lacked the necessary skills demanded by employers.<ref name=":46" />

Even though [[pundit]]s predicted that the uncertainty due to the 2016 Brexit Referendum would cause the British economy to falter or even fall into a recession, the unemployment rate has dipped below 4% while real wages have risen slightly in the late 2010s, two percent as of 2019. In particular, medical doctors and dentists saw their earnings bumped above the inflation rate in July 2019. Despite the fact that the government promised to an increase in public spending (£13&nbsp;billion, or 0.6% of GDP) in September 2019, public deficit continues to decline, as it has since 2010. Nevertheless, uncertainty surrounding Britain's international trade policy suppressed the chances of an export boom despite the depreciation of the pound sterling.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/10/31/britains-economy-is-holding-up-well-for-now?cid1=cust/dailypicks1/n/bl/n/2019115n/owned/n/n/dailypicks1/n/n/NA/337747/n|title=Britain's economy is holding up well – for now|date=October 31, 2019|work=The Economist|access-date=November 6, 2019|department=Britain}}</ref> According to the [[Office for National Statistics]], the median income of the United Kingdom in 2018 was £29,588.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/24/these-are-the-highest-paying-entry-level-jobs-in-the-uk.html|title=These are the highest paying entry level jobs in the UK|last=Taylor|first=Chloe|date=July 24, 2019|work=CNBC|access-date=November 6, 2019|department=Work}}</ref>

Since joining the European Union during the [[2007 enlargement of the European Union]], Bulgaria has seen a significant portion of its population, many of whom young and educated, leave for better opportunities elsewhere, notably Germany. While the government has failed to keep reliable statistics, economists have estimated that at least 60,000 Bulgarians leave their homeland each year. 30,000 moved to Germany in 2017. As of 2019, an estimated 1.1&nbsp;million Bulgarians lived abroad. Bulgaria had a population of about seven million in 2018, and this number is projected to continue to decline not just due to low birth rates but also to emigration.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190913-how-to-slow-down-the-worlds-fastest-shrinking-country|title=How to slow down the world's fastest-shrinking country|last=Hruby|first=Denise|date=September 30, 2019|work=BBC Worklife|access-date=January 24, 2020|department=Generation Project}}</ref>

Due to the strong correlation between economic growth and youth employment, recessions come with dire consequences for young people in the workforce. In the struggling Southern European economies, such as Greece and Spain, youth unemployment lingered on in the aftermath of the Great Recession, remaining stuck at around a third. With another recession induced by the COVID-19 global pandemic, it could rise to about half. Even the Czech Republic, which previously boasted the lowest youth unemployment rate in Europe, at about 5%, could see that number triple in 2020. Overall, European job markets are hostile towards new entrants, who, unlike their older counterparts, do not have permanent contracts and are often the first to be laid off during hard times.<ref name=":46" />

===In Canada===
In Canada, the youth unemployment rate in July 2009 was 16%, the highest in 11 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/youth-unemployment-highest-in-11-years-statscan-1.785405|title=Youth unemployment highest in 11 years: StatsCan|date=10 July 2009|access-date=20 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714164248/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/youth-unemployment-highest-in-11-years-statscan-1.785405|archive-date=14 July 2009|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|url-status=dead}}</ref> Between 2014 and 2019, Canada's overall unemployment rate fell from about 7% to below 6%.<ref name=":122" /> However, a 2018 survey by accounting and advisory firm BDO Canada found that 34% of millennials felt "overwhelmed" by their non-mortgage debt. For comparison, this number was 26% for Generation X and 13% for the Baby Boomers. Canada's average non-mortgage debt was CAN$20,000 in 2018. About one in five millennials were delaying having children because of financial worries. Many Canadian millennial couples are also struggling with their student loan debts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4528546/millennials-debt-kids-bdo-survey/|title=One in 5 Canadian millennials are delaying having kids due to money worries: BDO|last=Alini|first=Erica|date=October 10, 2018|work=Global News|access-date=January 21, 2020|department=Money}}</ref>
[[File:Ottawa skyline Wikivoyage.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|330x330px|Ottawa became a magnet for millennials in the late 2010s.]]
Despite expensive housing costs, Canada's largest cities, Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal, continue to attract millennials thanks to their economic opportunities and cultural amenities. Research by the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] (RBC) revealed that for every person in the 20-34 age group who leaves the nation's top cities, Toronto gains seven while Vancouver and Montreal gain up to a dozen each. In fact, there has been a surge in the millennial populations of Canada's top three cities between 2015 and 2018. However, millennials' rate of home ownership will likely drop as increasing numbers choose to rent instead.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/think-millennials-are-leaving-canada-s-big-cities-think-again-rbc-report-says-1.5111071|title=Think millennials are leaving Canada's big cities?

Many of the millennials relocating to the nation's capital were above the age of 25, meaning they were more likely to be job seekers and home buyers rather than students.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Raymond|first=Ted|date=February 21, 2020|title=Ottawa the top destination for moving millennials: study|work=CTV News – Ottawa|url=https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ottawa-the-top-destination-for-moving-millennials-study-1.4820839|access-date=May 3, 2020}}</ref>

An average Canadian home was worth CAN$484,500 in 2018. Despite government legislation (mortgage stress test rules), such a price was quite high compared to some decades before. Adjusted for inflation, it was CAN$210,000 in 1976. Paul Kershaw of the University of British Columbia calculated that the average amount of extra money needed for a down payment in the late 2010s compared to one generation before was equivalent to eating 17 avocado toasts each day for ten years.<ref name=":13" /> Meanwhile, the option of renting in a large city is increasingly out of reach for many young Canadians. In 2019, the average rent in Canada cost CAN$1,040 a month, according to the [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] (CMHC). But, as is always the case in real-estate, location matters. An average two-bedroom apartment cost CAN$1,748 per month in Vancouver and CAN$1,547 per month in Toronto, with vacancy rates at about 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively.<ref>{{Cite news|last=McElroy|first=Justin|date=January 15, 2020|title=Vancouver keeps crown as Canadian metropolis with highest rents and lowest vacancies|work=CBC|department=British Columbia|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-cmhc-rental-highest-canada-2020-1.5426911|access-date=July 30, 2020}}</ref> Canada's national vacancy rate was 2.4% in 2018, the lowest since 2009. New supply—rental apartment complexes that are newly completed or under construction—has not been able to keep up with rising demand. Besides higher prices, higher interest rates and stricter mortgage rules have made home ownership more difficult. International migration contributes to rising demand for housing, especially rental apartments, according to the CMHC, as new arrivals tend to rent rather than purchase. Moreover, a slight decline in youth unemployment in 2018 also drove up demand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4814651/monthly-rents-canada-report/|title=Monthly rent across Canada expected to rise – especially in these 3 cities: report|last=Dangerfield|first=Katie|date=January 4, 2019|work=Global News|access-date=October 21, 2019|department=Consumer}}</ref> While the Canadian housing market is growing, this growth is detrimental to the financial well-being of young Canadians.<ref name=":13">{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_t6fa4xeJA|title=High housing prices hard on millennials|date=August 16, 2018|work=CBC News|access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/crea-housing-july-1.4785863|title=Average Canadian house sold for $481,500 last month, up 1% in past year|last=Evans|first=Peter|date=August 15, 2018|work=CBC News|access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref>

In 2019, Canada's net public debt was CAN$768&nbsp;billion. Meanwhile, U.S. public debt amounted to US$22&nbsp;trillion. The Canadian federal government's official figure for the debt-to-GDP ratio was 31%. However, this figure left out debts from lower levels of government. Once these were taken into account, the figure jumped to 88%, according to the International Monetary Fund. For comparison, that number was 238% for Japan, 107% for the United States, and 99% for France. Canada's public debt per person was over CAN$18,000.

Between the late-2000s and mid-2010s, Canada's tourism deficit—the difference in the amount Canadian travelers spent inside versus outside the nation—grew considerably, exceeding CAN$10 billion in 2008. According to Destination Canada, a Crown agency responsible for promoting tourism in Canada, younger Canadians were eight times more likely to travel outside Canada and inside the nation. This is due to a number of factors. The cost of transportation within Canada was often higher than that of traveling to other countries. For example, flight tickets to Europe were often cheaper than to Toronto or Montreal. Many Canadian millennials view foreign destinations as exotic and more desirable than in Canada. Social media influenced this tendency, as posts showcasing non-Canadian sites were better received than those about Canadian destinations.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Blackwell|first=Richard|date=May 8, 2016|title=Canadian tourism industry losing out as millennials travel abroad|work=The Globe and Mail|department=Tourism|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/canadian-tourism-industry-losing-out-as-millennials-travel-abroad/article29934647/|access-date=July 12, 2019}}</ref>

Florida and his team also found, using U.S. Census data between 2005 and 2017, an increase in employment across the board for members of the "creative class"—people in education, healthcare, law, the arts, technology, science, and business, not all of whom have a university degree—in virtually all U.S. metropolitan areas with a population of a million or more. Indeed, the total number of the creative class grew from 44&nbsp;million in 2005 to over 56&nbsp;million in 2017.

Economist Tim Wojan and his colleagues at the Economic Research Service of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] analyzed 11,000 businesses using data collected in 2014 and classified them into three groups: substantive innovators, nominal innovators, and non-innovators. They found that 20% of the establishments hailed from rural areas compared to 30% from urban areas. In addition, large innovative firms were more likely to be found in rural areas while small and medium firms tended to come from the metropolitan areas. This is because large patent-intensive manufacturing firms—such as those manufacturing chemicals, electronic components, automotive parts, or medical equipment—were generally based in rural areas while those that provide services tend to cluster in the cities. Nevertheless, rural creative centers tend to be relatively close to large urban centers. The [[National Endowment for the Arts]] reported in 2017 that a rural county's probability of having a performing arts organization increased by 60% if it is located near a forest or a [[List of national parks of the United States|national park]].

Yet by the late 2010s, things changed. Like older generations, millennials reevaluate their life choices as they age. Millennials no longer felt attracted by cosmopolitan metropolitan areas the way they once did. A 2018 Gallup poll found that despite living in a highly urbanized country, most Americans would rather live in rural counties than the cities. While rural America lacked the occupational diversity offered by urban America, multiple rural counties can still match one major city in terms of economic opportunities. In addition, rural towns suffered from shortages of certain kinds of professionals, such as medical doctors, and young people moving in, or back, could make a difference for both themselves and their communities. The slower pace of life and lower costs of living were both important.<ref name=":39">{{Cite news|last=Brown|first=Jeffrey|date=December 2, 2019|title=Why millennials are moving away from large urban centers|work=PBS Newshour|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-millennials-are-moving-away-from-large-urban-centers|access-date=May 2, 2020}}</ref>

By analyzing U.S. Census data, demographer [[William H. Frey]] at the Brookings Institution found that, following the [[Great Recession]], American suburbs grew faster than dense urban cores. For example, for every one person who moved to New York City, five moved out to one of its suburbs. Data released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2017 revealed that Americans aged 25–29 were 25% more likely to move from a city to a suburb than the other way around; for older millennials, that number was 50%. Economic recovery and easily obtained mortgages help explain this phenomenon.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/04/19/high-prices-in-americas-cities-are-reviving-the-suburbs|title=High prices in America's cities are reviving the suburbs|date=August 19, 2018|work=The Economist|access-date=October 4, 2019|department=Property and Demography}}</ref> Millennial homeowners are more likely to be in the suburbs than the cities.

For example, a 2019 poll by Edelman Intelligence of 1,900 residents of California found that 63% of millennials said they were thinking about leaving the Golden State and 55% said they wanted to do so within five years. 60% of millennials said the reason why they wanted to move as the cost and availability of housing. In 2018, the median home price in California was US$547,400, about twice the national median. California also has the highest marginal income tax rate of all U.S. states, 12%, plus a subcharge of 1% for those earning a million dollars a year or more.

Average home sizes was declining between the early- and late-2010s. Nevertheless, entry-level homes, which almost ceased to exist due to the housing bubble, started to return in numbers as builders respond to rising demand from millennials. In order to cut construction costs, builders offer few to no options for floor plans. Previously, the Great Recession forced millennials delay home ownership. But by the late 2010s, older millennials had accumulated sufficient savings and were ready to buy a home, get married, and have children. Prices have risen in the late 2010s due to high demand, but this could attract more companies to enter the business of building affordable homes.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Davidson|first=Paul|date=January 10, 2020|title=Buying a new house may now be easier for millennials as more starter homes get built|work=USA Today|department=Money|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/01/10/buying-home-millennials-may-now-able-afford-new-house/2850016001/|access-date=July 12, 2020}}</ref>

As a consequence of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]], interest in suburban properties skyrocketed, with millennials being the largest block of buyers. In May 2020, when the real-estate market was recovering, searches for suburban properties rose 13%, or twice the rate for urban areas. This trend was observed in more than 50 of the largest 100 American metropolitan areas. In New York City, for example, demand for apartment units in Manhattan nosedived at an annualized rate of 80% in May. As more and more people reconsider whether they would like to live in a densely populated urban environment with high-rise apartments, cultural amenities, and shared spaces rather than a suburban single-family home with their own backyard, the homebuilding industry was seeing better recovery than expected.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Olick|first=Diana|date=June 18, 2020|title=The flight to the suburbs is real and growing, as coronavirus changes the way people live|work=CNBC|department=Real Estate|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/coronavirus-update-people-flee-cities-to-live-in-suburbs.html|access-date=June 18, 2020}}</ref> As millennials and senior citizens increasingly demand affordable housing outside the major cities, to prevent another housing bubble, banks and regulators have restricted lending to filter out speculators and those with bad credit.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Guerin|first=Jessica|date=March 26, 2019|title=Millennials, seniors are fleeing cities in search of affordable housing|work=Housing Wire|url=https://www.housingwire.com/articles/48558-millennials-seniors-are-fleeing-cities-in-search-of-affordable-housing/|access-date=July 29, 2020}}</ref>

==Education==

=== Global trends ===
From the late 1990s to the late 2010s, education transformed the economic realities of countries worldwide. As the people from developing nations became better educated, they close the gap between them and the developed world. Hence Westerners lost their relative advantage in education, as the world saw more people with high-school diplomas than ever before; the number of people with bachelor's and advanced degrees grew significantly as well. Westerners who only passed secondary school had their income cut in real terms during that same period while those with university degrees had incomes that barely increased on average. In addition, the fact that many jobs can be done remotely thanks to modern technology further eroded the relative advantage of education in the West, resulting in a backlash against immigration and globalization.<ref name=":55">{{Cite news|last=Soloman|first=Paul|date=May 31, 2018|title=Why the new global wealth of educated women spurs backlash|work=PBS Newshour|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-new-global-wealth-of-educated-women-spurs-backlash|access-date=November 20, 2020}}</ref>

As more and more women became educated in the developing world, more leave the rural areas for the cities, enter the work force and compete with men, sparking resentment among men in those countries.<ref name=":55" />

===In continental Europe===
In Sweden, universities are tuition-free, as is the case in Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and Finland. However, Swedish students typically graduate very indebted due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm. The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite incessant talk of student debt reaching epic proportions, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008–09 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a govern agency known as the [[National Board of Student Aid (Sweden)|Centrala Studiestödsnämnden]] (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the 2008–09 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995. In the United States, there was an increase in the former but not the latter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/the-high-price-of-a-free-college-education-in-sweden/276428/|title=The High Price of a Free College Education in Sweden|last=Philips|first=Matt|date=May 31, 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=November 4, 2019|department=Global}}</ref>

In 2005, judges in Karlsruhe, Germany, struck down a ban on university fees as unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the constitutional right of German states to regulate their own higher education systems. This ban was introduced in order to ensure equality of access to higher education regardless of socioeconomic class. Bavarian Science Minister Thomas Goppel told the Associated Press, "Fees will help to preserve the quality of universities." Supporters of fees argued that they would help ease the financial burden on universities and would incentivize students to study more efficiently, despite not covering the full cost of higher education, an average of €8,500 as of 2005. Opponents believed fees would make it more difficult for people to study and graduate on time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-court-lifts-ban-on-student-fees/a-1468971|title=German Court Lifts Ban on Student Fees|date=January 26, 2005|work=DW|access-date=November 4, 2019|department=Germany}}</ref> Germany also suffered from a brain drain, as many bright researchers moved abroad while relatively few international students were interested in coming to Germany. This has led to the decline of German research institutions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/promoting-brain-gain-for-german-universities/a-1299063|title=Promoting Brain Gain for German Universities|date=April 16, 2004|work=DW|access-date=November 5, 2019|department=Germany}}</ref>

===In English-speaking countries===
In the 1990s, due to a combination of financial hardship and the fact that universities elsewhere charged tuition, British universities pressed the government to allow them to take in fees. A nominal tuition fee of £1,000 was introduced in autumn 1998. Because not all parents would be able to pay all the fees in one go, monthly payment options, loans, and grants were made available. Some were concerned that making people pay for higher education may deter applicants. This turned out not to be the case. The number of applications fell by only 3% in 1998, and mainly due to mature students rather than 18-year-olds.<ref name=":16">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/student-choices-first-timers-face-the-test-with-tuition-fees-1153845.html|title=Student choices: First timers face the test with tuition fees|last=Hodges|first=Lucy|date=April 2, 1998|work=The Independent|access-date=November 4, 2019|department=Culture}}</ref>

In 2012, £9,000 worth of student fees were introduced. Despite this, the number of people interested in pursuing higher education grew at a faster rate than the UK population. In 2017, almost half of Britons have received higher education by the age of 30. Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the goal of having half of young Britons having a university degree in 1999, though he missed the 2010 deadline.<ref name=":19" /> What the Prime Minister did not realize, however, is that an oversupply of young people with high levels of education historically precipitated periods of political instability and unrest in various societies, from early modern Western Europe and late Tokugawa Japan to the Soviet Union, modern Iran, and the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turchin|first=Peter|date=July 2, 2008|title=Arise 'cliodynamics'|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/454034a|journal=Nature|volume=454|issue=7200|pages=34–5|doi=10.1038/454034a|pmid=18596791|bibcode=2008Natur.454...34T|s2cid=822431}}</ref><ref name=":51" /> In any case, demand for higher education in the United Kingdom remains strong, driven by the need for high-skilled workers from both the public and private sectors. There is, however, a widening gender gap. As of 2017, women were more likely to attend or have attended university than men, 55% to 43%, a 12% difference.<ref name=":19">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/28/almost-half-of-all-young-people-in-england-go-on-to-higher-education|title=Almost half of all young people in England go on to higher education|last=Adams|first=Richard|date=September 28, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 28, 2019|department=Higher Education}}</ref>

In Australia, university tuition fees were introduced in 1989. Regardless, the number of applicants has risen considerably. By the 1990s, students and their families were expected to pay 37% of the cost, up from a quarter in the late 1980s. The most expensive subjects were law, medicine, and dentistry, followed by the natural sciences, and then by the arts and social studies. Under the new funding scheme, the Government of Australia also capped the number of people eligible for higher education, enabling schools to recruits more well-financed (though not necessarily bright) students.<ref name=":16" />

In 2018, upwards of one third of each sex is a university student.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/184272/educational-attainment-of-college-diploma-or-higher-by-gender/|title=Percentage of the U.S. population who have completed four years of college or more from 1940 to 2018, by gender|last=Duffin|first=Erin|date=August 9, 2019|website=Statista|access-date=October 25, 2019}}</ref>

In the United States today, high school students are generally encouraged to attend college or university after graduation while the options of technical school and vocational training are often neglected.<ref name=":112"/> Historically, high schools separated students on career tracks, with programs aimed at students bound for higher education and those bound for the workforce. Students with learning disabilities or behavioral issues were often directed towards vocational or technical schools. All this changed in the late 1980s and early 1990s thanks to a major effort in the large cities to provide more abstract academic education to everybody. The mission of high schools became preparing students for college, referred to as "high school to Harvard."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/should-more-kids-skip-college-for-workforce-training|title=Should more kids skip college for workforce training?|date=January 26, 2016|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref> However, this program faltered in the 2010s, as institutions of higher education came under heightened skepticism due to high costs and disappointing results. People became increasingly concerned about debts and deficits. No longer were promises of educating "citizens of the world" or estimates of economic impact coming from abstruse calculations sufficient. Colleges and universities found it necessary to prove their worth by clarifying how much money from which industry and company funded research, and how much it would cost to attend.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/facing-skepticism-colleges-set-out-to-prove-their-value|title=Facing skepticism, colleges set out to prove their value|last=Marcus|first=Jon|date=January 22, 2016|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the number of university students majoring in homeland security, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]), and healthcare skyrocketed.

According to the U.S. [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], people with technical or vocational trainings are slightly more likely to be employed than those with a bachelor's degree and significantly more likely to be employed in their fields of specialty.<ref name=":112"/> The United States currently suffers from a shortage of skilled tradespeople.<ref name=":112" />

Despite the fact that educators and political leaders, such as President Barack Obama, have been trying to years to improve the quality of STEM education in the United States, and that various polls have demonstrated that more students are interested in these subjects, graduating with a STEM degree is a different kettle of fish altogether. Data collected by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], (UCLA) in 2011 showed that although these students typically came in with excellent high school GPAs and SAT scores, among science and engineering students, including pre-medical students, 60% changed their majors or failed to graduate, twice the attrition rate of all other majors combined. Despite their initial interest in secondary school, many university students find themselves overwhelmed by the reality of a rigorous STEM education. Some are mathematically unskilled, while others are simply lazy. The [[National Science Board]] raised the alarm all the way back in the mid-1980s that students often forget why they wanted to be scientists and engineers in the first place. Many bright students had an easy time in high school and failed to develop good study habits. In contrast, Chinese, Indian, and Singaporean students are exposed to mathematics and science at a high level from a young age. Moreover, given two students who are equally prepared, the one who goes to a more prestigious university is less likely to graduate with a STEM degree than the one who attends a less difficult school. Competition can defeat even the top students. Meanwhile, grade inflation is a real phenomenon in the humanities, giving students an attractive alternative if their STEM ambitions prove too difficult to achieve. Whereas STEM classes build on top of each other—one has to master the subject matter before moving to the next course—and have black and white answers, this is not the case in the humanities, where things are a lot less clear-cut.<ref name=":56">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/education/edlife/why-science-majors-change-their-mind-its-just-so-darn-hard.html|title=Why Science Majors Change Their Minds (It's Just So Darn Hard)|last=Drew|first=Christopher|date=November 4, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 28, 2019|department=Education Life}}</ref>

Even though the majority of [[stroke]]s affect people aged 65 or older and the probability of having a stroke doubles only every decade after the age of 55, anyone can suffer from a stroke at any age. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is disrupted, causing neurons to die within minutes, leading to irreparable brain damage, disability, or even death. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ([[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]), strokes are the fifth leading cause of death and a major factor behind disability in the United States. According to the National Strokes Association, the risk of having a stroke is increasing among young adults (those in their 20s and 30s) and even adolescents. During the 2010s, there was a 44% increase in the number of young people hospitalized for strokes. Health experts believe this development is due to a variety of reasons related to lifestyle choices, including obesity, smoking, alcoholism, and physical inactivity. Obesity is also linked to [[hypertension]], [[diabetes]], and [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol levels]]. CDC data reveals that during the mid-2000s, about 28% of young Americans were obese; this number rose to 36% a decade later. Up to 80% of strokes can be prevented by making healthy lifestyle choices while the rest are due to factors beyond a person's control, namely age and genetic defects (such as [[Congenital heart defect|congenital heart disease]]). In addition, between 30% and 40% of young patients suffered from cryptogenic strokes, or those with unknown causes.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Pierce|first=Shanley|date=May 6, 2019|title=Strokes among younger people on the rise|work=Texas Medical Center|url=https://www.tmc.edu/news/2019/05/strokes-among-younger-patients-on-the-rise/|access-date=June 15, 2020}}</ref>

[[File:US teens political views (Gallup 2004).png|400x400px|alt=|left]]
A 2004 Gallup poll of Americans aged 13 to 17 found that 71% said their social and political views were more or less the same as those of their parents. 21% thought they were more liberal and 7% more conservative. According to demographer and public policy analyst [[Phillip Longman|Philip Longman]], "even among baby boomers, those who wound up having children have turned out to be remarkably similar to their parents in their attitudes about 'family' values."<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/14515/teens-stay-true-parents-political-perspectives.aspx|title=Teens Stay True to Parents' Political Perspectives|last=Lyons|first=Linda|date=January 4, 2005|work=Gallup Poll|access-date=November 2, 2019}}</ref> In the postwar era, most returning servicemen looked forward to "making a home and raising a family" with their wives and lovers, and for many men, family life was a source of fulfillment and a refuge from the stress of their careers.

Another 2004 Gallup poll of the same age group found that a clear majority of teenagers considered themselves to be politically moderate, 56%. Only 7% and 18% deemed themselves very conservative or conservative, respectively, and 10% and 6% believed they were liberal or very liberal, respectively. (The bar plot roughly resembles a [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]] or an isosceles triangle centered around moderates. See right.) By comparing with a 2004 poll of Americans aged 18 and over, Gallup discovered that teens were substantially more moderate then adults (56% to 38%), less conservative (25% to 40%), and just about as liberal (16% to 19%).<ref name=":1" /> However, political scientist Elias Dinas discovered, by studying the results from the Political Socialisation Panel Study and further data from the United Kingdom and the United States, that while children born to politically engaged parents tended to be politically engaged themselves, those who absorbed their parents' views the earliest were also the most likely to abandon them later in life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dinas|first=Elias|date=March 12, 2013|title=Why Does the Apple Fall Far from the Tree?

''The Economist'' observed in 2013 that, like their British counterparts, millennials in the United States held more positive attitudes towards recognizing same-sex marriage than older demographic cohorts.<ref name="economist.com" /> However, a 2018 poll conducted by [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris]] on behalf of the LGBT advocacy group [[GLAAD]] found that despite being frequently described as the most tolerant segment of society, people aged 18 to 34—most Millennials and the oldest members of Generation Z—have become less accepting LGBT individuals compared to previous years. In 2016, 63% of Americans in that age group said they felt comfortable interacting with members of the LGBT community; that number dropped to 53% in 2017 and then to 45% in 2018. On top of that, more people reported discomfort learning that a family member was LGBT (from 29% in 2017 to 36% in 2018), having a child learning LGBT history (30% to 39%), or having an LGBT doctor (27% to 34%). Harris found that young women were driving this development; their overall comfort levels dived from 64% in 2017 to 52% in 2018. In general, the fall of comfort levels was the steepest among people aged 18 to 34 between 2016 and 2018.

[[File:US political leanings by age (Gallup 2018).png|center|597x597px]]
In 2018, Gallup conducted a survey of almost 14,000 Americans from all 50 states and the District of Columbia aged 18 and over on their political sympathies. They found that overall, younger adults tended to lean liberal while older adults tilted conservative. More specifically, groups with strong conservative leanings included the elderly, residents of the Midwest and the South, and people with some or no college education. Groups with strong liberal leanings were adults with advanced degrees, whereas those with moderate liberal leanings included younger adults (18 to 29 and 30 to 49), women, and residents of the East. Gallup found little variations by income groups compared to the national average. Among adults between the ages of 18 and 29—older Generation Z and younger Millennials—Gallup found that 30% identified as liberals, 40% as moderates, and 26% as conservatives. Among adults aged 30 to 49—older Millennials and younger Generation X—they found that 30% considered themselves liberals, 37% moderates, and 29% conservatives.(See above.) Between 1992 and 2018, the number of people identifying as liberals steadily increased, 17% to 26%, mainly at the expense of the group identifying as moderates. Meanwhile, the proportion of conservatives remained largely unchanged, albeit with fluctuations. Between 1994 and 2018, the number of members of the Democratic Party identifying as liberal rose from 25% to 51%, as the number of both moderates and conservatives gradually fell. Liberals became a majority in this political party for the first time in 2018. During the same period, in the Republican Party, the proportion of people calling themselves conservatives climbed from 58% to 73% while the numbers of moderates and liberals both dropped. In other words, this political party saw its conservative majority expanding. Meanwhile, among political independents, the percentage of moderates, the dominant group, remained largely unchanged.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Saad|first=Lydia|date=January 8, 2019|title=U.S. Still Leans Conservative, but Liberals Keep Recent Gains|work=Gallup Poll|department=Politics|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/245813/leans-conservative-liberals-keep-recent-gains.aspx|access-date=December 25, 2019}}</ref>[[File:Same-sex Marriage Generational Attitudes.png|alt=|550x550px|right]]2018 surveys of American teenagers 13 to 17 and adults aged 18 or over conducted by the Pew Research Center found that Millennials and Generation Z held similar views on various political and social issues. More specifically, 56% of Millennials believed that climate change is real and is due to human activities while only 8% reject the [[scientific consensus on climate change]]. 64% wanted the government to play a more active role in solving their problems. 65% were indifferent towards pre-nuptial cohabitation. 48% considered single motherhood to be neither a positive or a negative for society. 61% saw increased ethnic or racial diversity as good for society. 47% did the same for same-sex marriage, and 53% interracial marriage. (See chart.) In most cases, Millennials tended hold quite different views from the Silent Generation, with the Baby Boomers and Generation X in between. In the case of financial responsibility in a two-parent household, though, majorities from across the generations answered that it should be shared, with 58% for the Silent Generation, 73% for the Baby Boomers, 78% for Generation X, and 79% for both the Millennials and Generation Z. Across all the generations surveyed, at least 84% thought that both parents ought to be responsible for rearing children. Very few thought that fathers should be the ones mainly responsible for taking care of children.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-01-17|title=Generation Z Looks a Lot Like Millennials on Key Social and Political Issues|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/|access-date=November 22, 2019|work=Pew Research Center|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2015, a [[Pew Research]] study found 40% of millennials in the United States supported government restriction of public speech offensive to minority groups. Support for restricting offensive speech was lower among older generations, with 27% of Gen Xers, 24% of Baby Boomers, and only 12% of the Silent Generation supporting such restrictions. Pew Research noted similar age related trends in the United Kingdom, but not in Germany and Spain, where millennials were less supportive of restricting offensive speech than older generations.

A 2018 Gallup poll found that people aged 18 to 29 have a more favorable view of [[Socialism in the United States|socialism]] than capitalism, 51% to 45%. Nationally, 56% of Americans prefer capitalism compared to 37% who favor socialism. Older Americans consistently prefer capitalism to socialism. Whether the current attitudes of millennials and Generation Z on capitalism and socialism will persist or dissipate as they grow older remains to be seen.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Newport|first=Frank|date=August 13, 2018|title=Democrats More Positive About Socialism Than Capitalism|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx|access-date=May 16, 2019|website=Gallup}}</ref>

Gallup polls conducted in 2019 revealed that 62% of people aged 18 to 29—older members of Generation Z and younger Millennials—support giving women access to [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]] while 33% opposed. In general, the older someone was, the less likely that they supported abortion. 56% of people aged 65 or over did not approve of abortion compared to 37% who did. (See chart to the right.) Gallup found in 2018 that nationwide, Americans are split on the issue of abortion, with equal numbers of people considering themselves "pro-life" or "pro-choice", 48%.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019|title="Pro-Choice" or "Pro-Life," 2018 Demographic Table|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx|access-date=November 16, 2019|website=Gallup}}</ref>

In his doctoral dissertation submitted in 2003, social psychologist Jason Weeden conducted statistical analyses on general-public and undergraduate datasets and reached conclusions supporting the hypothesis that attitudes towards abortion are more strongly predicted by mating-relevant variables than by variables related to views on the sanctity of life.<ref name=":43">Weeden, Jason (2003). ''[https://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI3087480/ Genetic interests, life histories, and attitudes towards abortion]''. Scholarly Commons. University of Pennsylvania.</ref> Some evolutionary psychologists and sociologists believe that the various mating strategies are in direct strategic conflict—a [[zero-sum game]]—and as such can influence political persuasion. For instance, the stability of long-term partnerships may be threatened by the availability of short-term sexual opportunities. Therefore, public policy measures that impose costs on casual sexual intercourse may benefit people pursuing long-term mating strategies by reducing the availability of short-term mating opportunities outside of committed relationships. Such policies include the prohibition of abortion and of recreational drug use. This relationship remained strong even when controlling for personality traits, political orientation, and moral values. By contrast, nonsexual variables typically associated with attitudes towards drug legalization were strongly attenuated or eliminated when controlling for sexuality-related measures.<ref name=":43" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kurzban|first1=Robert|last2=Dukes|first2=Amber|last3=Weeden|first3=Jason|date=June 16, 2010|title=Sex, drugs and moral goals: reproductive strategies and views about recreational drugs|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|volume=277|issue=1699|pages=3501–3508|doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.0608|pmc=2982222|pmid=20554547|doi-access=free|s2cid=7206927}}</ref> These findings were replicated in Belgium, Japan, and the Netherlands.<ref>Quintelier, K.J., Ishii, K., Weeden, J., Kurzban, R., & Braeckman, J.

Polls conducted by Gallup and the Pew Research Center found that support for stricter gun laws among people aged 18 to 29 and 18 to 36, respectively, is statistically no different from that of the general population.

In 2019, the Pew Research Center interviewed over 2,000 Americans aged 18 and over on their views of various components of the federal government. They found that 54% of the people between the ages of 18 and 29 wanted larger government and larger compared to 43% who preferred smaller government and fewer services. Meanwhile, 46% of those between the ages of 30 and 49 favored larger government compared to 49% who picked the other option. Older people were more likely to dislike larger government. Overall, the American people remain divided over the size and scope of government, with 48% preferring smaller government with fewer services and 46% larger government and more services. They found that the most popular federal agencies were the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] (90% favorable), the [[National Park Service]] (86%), [[NASA]] (81%), the CDC (80%), the FBI (70%), the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] (69%), the [[Social Security Administration|SSA]] (66%), the CIA, and the Federal Reserve (both 65%).

According to a 2019 CBS News poll on 2,143 U.S. residents, 72% of Americans 18 to 44 years of age—Generations X, Y (Millennials), and Z—believed that it is a matter of personal responsibility to tackle climate change while 61% of older Americans did the same. In addition, 42% of American adults under 45 years old thought that the U.S. could realistically transition to 100% [[Renewable energy in the United States|renewable energy]] by 2050 while 29% deemed it unrealistic and 29% were unsure. Those numbers for older Americans are 34%, 40%, and 25%, respectively.

In early 2019, Harvard University's Institute of Politics Youth Poll asked voters aged 18 to 29—younger millennials and the first wave of Generation Z—what they would like to be priorities for U.S. foreign policy. They found that the top issues for these voters were countering terrorism and protecting human rights (both 39%), and protecting the environment (34%). Preventing nuclear proliferation and defending U.S. allies were not as important to young American voters. The Poll found that support for [[Single-payer healthcare|single-payer universal healthcare]] and free college dropped, down 8% to 47% and down 5% to 51%, respectively, if cost estimates were provided.<ref>{{Cite web|date=April 22, 2019|title=Spring 2019 Harvard IOP Youth Poll Results|url=https://iop.harvard.edu/about/newsletter-press-release/spring-2019-harvard-iop-youth-poll-results|access-date=September 14, 2019|website=Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics}}</ref>

==== Votes ====
Millennials are more willing to vote than previous generations when they were at the same age. With voter rates being just below 50% for the four presidential cycles before 2017, they have already surpassed members of Generation X of the same age who were at just 36%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2017/07/31/millennials-will-soon-be-the-largest-voting-bloc-in-america/|title=Millennials will soon be the largest voting bloc in America|last=Galston|first=William A.|date=31 July 2017}}</ref>

[[Pew Research]] described millennials as playing a significant role in the election of [[Barack Obama]] as President of the United States. Millennials were between 12 and 27 during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 U.S presidential election]].<ref name="Pew2019" /> That year, the number of voters aged 18 to 29 who chose the Democratic candidate was 66%, a record since 1980. The total share of voters who backed the President's party was 53%, another record. For comparison, only 31% of voters in that age group backed John McCain, who got only 46% of the votes. Among millennials, Obama received votes from 54% of whites, 95% of blacks, and 72% of Hispanics. There was no significant difference between those with college degrees and those without, but millennial women were more likely to vote for Obama than men (69% vs. 62%). Among voters between the ages of 18 and 29, 45% identified with the Democratic Party while only 26% sided with the Republican Party, a gap of 19%. Back in 2000, the two main American political parties split the vote of this age group. This was a significant shift in the American political landscape. Millennials not only provided their votes but also the enthusiasm that marked the 2008 election. They volunteered in political campaigns and donated money.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Young Voters in the 2008 Election|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/2008/11/13/young-voters-in-the-2008-election/|last=Rosentiel|first=Tom|date=November 13, 2008|website=Pew Research Center|access-date=May 8, 2020}}</ref> But that millennial enthusiasm all but vanished by the next election cycle while older voters showed more interest.<ref name=":41">{{Cite web|title=Generations and the 2012 Election|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2011/11/02/generations-and-the-2012-election/|last=Heimlich|first=Russel|date=November 2, 2011|website=Pew Research Center|access-date=May 8, 2020}}</ref> In 2012, when Americans reelected Barack Obama, the voter participation gap between people above the age of 65 and those aged 18 to 24 was 31%.<ref name=":30" /> Pew polls conducted a year prior showed that while Millennials preferred Barack Obama to Mitt Romney (61% to 37%), members of the Silent Generation leaned towards Romney rather than Obama (54% to 41%). But when looking at white millennials only, Pew found that Obama's advantage which he enjoyed in 2008 ceased to be, as they were split between the two candidates.<ref name=":41" />

Although Millennials are one of the largest voting blocs in the United States, their voting turnout rates have been subpar. Between the mid-2000s and the mid-2010s, Millennial voting participation was consistently below those of their elders, fluctuating between 46% and 51%. For comparison, turnout rates for Generation X and the Baby Boomers rose during the same period, 60% to 69% and 41% to 63%, respectively, while those of the oldest of voters remained consistently at 69% or more. Millennials may still be a potent force at the ballot box, but it may be years before their participation rates reach their numerical potential as young people are consistently less likely to vote than their elders.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fry|first=Richard|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/03/millennials-approach-baby-boomers-as-largest-generation-in-u-s-electorate/|title=Millennials approach Baby Boomers as America's largest generation in the electorate|date=April 3, 2018|work=Fact Tank|access-date=April 18, 2020|publisher=Pew Research Center}}</ref> In addition, despite the hype surrounding the political engagement and possible record turnout among young voters, millennials' voting power is even weaker than first appeared due to the comparatively higher number of them who are non-citizens (12%, as of 2019), according to William Frey of the Brookings Institution.<ref name=":28" />

In general, the phenomenon of growing political distrust and de-alignment in the United States is similar to what has been happening in Europe since the last few decades of the twentieth century, even though events like the Watergate scandal or the threatened impeachment of President Bill Clinton are unique to the United States. Such an atmosphere depresses turnouts among younger voters. Among voters in the 18-to-24 age group, turnout dropped from 51% in 1964 to 38% in 2012. Although people between the ages of 25 and 44 were more likely to vote, their turnout rate followed a similarly declining trend during the same period. Political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin argued that it was therefore unrealistic for Hillary Clinton to expect high turnout rates among millennials in 2016. This political environment also makes voters more likely to consider political outsiders such as Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.<ref name=":30" /> The Brookings Institution predicted that after 2016, millennials could affect how politics is conducted in the two-party system of the United States, given that they were more likely to identify as liberals or conservatives than Democrats or Republicans, respectively. In particular, while Trump supporters were markedly enthusiastic about their chosen candidate, the number of young voters identifying with the GOP has not increased.<ref name=":38" />

[[Bernie Sanders]], a self-proclaimed [[democratic socialist]] and Democratic candidate in the [[2016 United States presidential election]], was the most popular candidate among millennial voters in the [[United States presidential primary|primary phase]], having garnered more votes from people under 30 in 21 states than the major parties' candidates, [[Donald Trump]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], did combined.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/20/more-young-people-voted-for-bernie-sanders-than-trump-and-clinton-combined-by-a-lot/|title=More young people voted for Bernie Sanders than Trump and Clinton combined – by a lot|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|date=20 June 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=6 August 2016}}</ref> According to the Brookings Institution, turnout among voters aged 18 to 29 in the 2016 election was 50%. Hillary Clinton won 55% of the votes from this age group while Donald Trump secured 37%. Polls conducted right before the election showed that millennial blacks and Hispanics were concerned about a potential Trump presidency. By contrast, Trump commanded support among young whites, especially men. There was also an enthusiasm gap for the two main candidates. While 32% of young Trump supporters felt excited about the possibility of him being President, only 18% of Clinton supporters said the same about her. The Bookings Institution found that among Trump voters in the 18-to-29 age group, 15% were white women with college degrees, 18% were the same without, 14% were white men with college degrees, and 32% were the same without, for a grand total of 79%. These groups were only 48% of Clinton voters of the same age range in total. On the other hand, a total of 52% of Clinton voters aged 18 to 29 were non-whites with college degrees (17%) and non-whites without them (35%).<ref name=":38">{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/11/21/how-millennials-voted/|title=How Millennials voted this election|last1=Galston|first1=William A.|last2=Hendrickson|first2=Clara|date=November 21, 2016|publisher=Brookings Institution|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref> Clinton's chances of success were hampered by low turnouts among minorities and millennials with university degrees and students. Meanwhile, Trump voters included 41% of white millennials. These people tended to be non-degree holders with full-time jobs and were markedly ''less'' likely to be financially insecure than those who did not support Trump. Contrary to the claim that young Americans felt comfortable with the ongoing transformation of the ethnic composition of their country due to immigration, not all of them approve of this change despite the fact that they are an ethnically diverse cohort.<ref name=":32" /> In the end, Trump won more votes from whites between the ages of 18 and 29 than early polls suggested.<ref name=":38" />

As is the case with many European countries, empirical evidence poses real challenges to the popular argument that the surge of nationalism and populism is an ephemeral phenomenon due to 'angry white old men' who would inevitably be replaced by younger and more liberal voters.<ref name=":32" /> Especially since the 1970s, working-class voters, who had previously formed the backbone of support for the [[New Deal]] introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, have been turning away from the left-leaning Democratic Party in favor of the right-leaning Republican Party. As the Democratic Party attempted to make itself friendlier towards the university-educated and women during the 1990s, more blue-collar workers and non-degree holders left. Political scientist [[Larry Bartels]] argued because about one quarter of Democrat supporters held social views more in-tune with Republican voters and because there was no guarantee Millennials would maintain their current political attitudes due to life-cycle effects, this process of political re-alignment would likely continue. As is the case with Europe, there are potential pockets of support for national populism among younger generations.<ref name=":30" />

A Reuters-Ipsos survey of 16,000 registered voters aged 18 to 34 conducted in the first three months of 2018 (and before the [[2018 United States elections|2018 midterm election]]) showed that overall support for Democratic Party among such voters fell by nine percent between 2016 and 2018 and that an increasing number favored the Republican Party's approach to the economy. Pollsters found that white millennials, especially men, were driving this change. In 2016, 47% of young whites said they would vote for the Democratic Party, compared to 33% for the Republican Party, a gap of 14% in favor of the Democrats. But in 2018, that gap vanished, and the corresponding numbers were 39% for each party. For young white men the shift was even more dramatic. In 2016, 48% said they would vote for the Democratic Party and 36% for the Republican Party. But by 2018, those numbers were 37% and 46%, respectively. This is despite the fact that almost two thirds of young voters disapproved of the performance of Republican President Donald J. Trump.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kahn|first=Chris|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-millennials/exclusive-democrats-lose-ground-with-millennials-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN1I10YH|title=Exclusive: Democrats lose ground with Millennials – Reuters/Ipsos poll|date=April 30, 2018|work=Reuters|access-date=July 23, 2019|postscript=.

===British millennials===
{{See also|Political history of the United Kingdom (1979–present)}}
''[[The Economist]]'' reported in 2013 that surveys of political attitudes among millennials in the United Kingdom revealed that they held more liberal views on social and economic matters than older demographic groups. They favored individual liberty, small government, low taxes, limited welfare programs, and personal responsibility. While support for increased welfare programs for the poor at the cost of potentially higher taxes has declined steadily since the 1980s among all living demographic cohorts in the U.K., Generation Y disapproved of such spending schemes the most, according to data from Ipsos MORI and the [[British Social Attitudes Survey]]. On the other hand, they had a more relaxed attitude towards alcohol consumption, [[euthanasia]], [[same-sex marriage]] and the [[legalization of drugs]]. They disliked immigration, though less than their elders. They were more likely then their elders to support [[Fiscal conservatism|public debt reduction]]. They cared about the environment, but not at the expense of economic prosperity, and they supported privatizing utilities. In other words, they were [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] or libertarians. Ipsos pollster Ben Page told ''The Economist'', "Every successive generation is less collectivist than the last."<ref name="economist.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21578666-britains-youth-are-not-just-more-liberal-their-elders-they-are-also-more-liberal-any|title=Generation Boris|date=June 1, 2013|work=The Economist|access-date=December 20, 2019}}</ref> [[File:Royal Navy Type 45 Destroyer HMS Dragon MOD 45153123.jpg|thumb|65% of British youths reported pride in the UK military.

A 2013 YouGov poll of almost a thousand people aged 18 to 24 in the United Kingdom found that 73% in total supported the legalization of [[same-sex marriage]] and only 15% opposed. 41% either strongly or somewhat supported legalizing "soft" drugs, such as [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] while 46% strongly or somewhat opposed. The five most popular political parties for young Britons were the Labour Party (23%), the Conservative Party (12%), the Liberal Democratic Party (7%), the Green Party (7%), and the United Kingdom Independence Party (6%). 19% of British youths identified with no party whatsoever. When asked which politician they admired, 77% picked the 'none' option, followed by [[Boris Johnson]] (4%). 59% had signed a petition. 47% had voted in a local or national election, and 19% had contacted a politician representing them. Overall, 60% had an unfavorable of the British political system. 12% thought British immigration laws were too tough, 54% said they were too lax, and 16% deemed them appropriate. About one third opined that taxes and public spending were too high. 22% said they were insufficient and one fifth thought they were about right. 34% believed welfare benefits were too generous and should be cut. 22% argued they were not enough and should be increased and 24% thought they struck the right balance. Almost three quarters agreed that the welfare system was frequently abused and 63% thought those who genuinely needed it were branded as 'scroungers'. A total of 40% were proud and 46% not proud of Britain's current welfare system. Some 39% thought that the current welfare system is financially untenable and needs to be slashed while 49% thought the status quo is fine. A total of 65% were either very or fairly proud of the United Kingdom Armed Forces, 62% the British Broadcasting Corporation ([[BBC]]), 77% the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). 57% thought that it would be possible to keep the NHS free at the point of service and 26% thought the NHS would eventually need to charge people in order to stay afloat.<ref name="YouGov" />

According to a YouGov poll conducted right before the referendum on the possible departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union ([[Brexit]]) in 2016, almost three quarters of voters aged 18 to 24 opposed leaving the E.U. while just under one fifth supported leaving.<ref name=":17">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/millenials-fury-over-baby-boomers-vote-for-brexit/|title=Millennials' 'fury' over baby boomers' vote for Brexit|last1=Boult|first1=Adam|date=24 June 2016|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref> 64% of Britons aged 25 to 29 and 61% between the ages of 30 to 35 supported remaining in the E.U.<ref name=":18">{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/06/24/news/millenials-eu-referendum-brexit/|title=British Millennials: You've stolen our future|last1=Kottasova|first1=Ivana|date=24 June 2016|access-date=24 June 2016|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Meanwhile, 34% of pensioners wanted to remain and 59% wanted to leave.<ref name=":17" /> Older people were more likely to vote,<ref name=":18" /> and vote to leave.<ref name=":17" /> One of the reasons behind this generational gap is the fundamentally different environment that millennial voters grew up in. Many older voters came of age when Britain was a majority-white country, when collective memory of the British Empire and its victory in World War II was strong, when most people did not attend university, when abortion and homosexuality were illegal and the death penalty remained in place till the 1960s. By contrast, millennials, many of whom support the left-wing politician [[Jeremy Corbyn]], grew up at a time when the United Kingdom was a member of the EU, when graduation from university was common, and when the political consensus favors immigration and EU membership.

While young people tend to view the European Union more favorably, it is erroneous to believe that they all oppose Brexit for all the same reasons. For example, someone from Northern Ireland is probably more concerned about the prospects of a physical [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border|border]] between that part of the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland than, say, losing the ability to study abroad in continental Europe under the E.U.-sponsored [[Erasmus Programme|Erasmus Program]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/b8d097b0-3ad4-4dd9-aa25-af6374292de0|title=The truth about young people and Brexit|last=Spratt|first=Vicky|date=October 5, 2018|work=BBC|access-date=December 20, 2019}}</ref> Nor is it accurate to say that the proponents of Brexit form a homogeneous group.

Despite reports of a surge in turnouts among young voters in the 2015 and 2017 United Kingdom general elections, statistical scrutiny by the [[British Election Study|British Elections Study]] revealed that the margin of error was too large to determine whether or not there was a significant increase or decrease in the number of young participants.

Historically, political participation among young Canadian voters has been low, no higher than 40%.<ref name=":7">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2a484194-edde-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901|title=Young Canadians fall out of love with Justin Trudeau|last=Kirby|first=Jason|date=October 14, 2019|work=The Financial Times|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> However, the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]] was an exception, when 57% of the people aged 18 to 34 voted. Canadian millennials played a key role in the election of [[Justin Trudeau]] as Prime Minister of Canada. While [[Stephen Harper]] and the Conservative Party received approximately the same number of votes as they did in 2011, the surge in the youth vote was enough to push Trudeau to the top. His core campaign message centered around gender equality, tolerance, legalizing marijuana, addressing climate change, and governmental transparency while Harper focused on tax cuts. Nevertheless, political scientist Melanee Thomas at the University of Calgary warned that the electoral power of this demographic group should not be overestimated, since millennials do not vote as a single bloc.<ref name=":7" /> Even though millennials tend to vote for left-leaning candidates, certain items from right-leaning platforms can resonate with them, such as high but affordable standards of living.<ref name=":8">{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/5938985/millenials-biggest-voting-block-canada-election-2019/|title=For the 1st time, millennial voters will make up the biggest voting bloc in a federal election|last=Dhaliwal|first=Taz|date=September 30, 2019|work=Global News|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref>

A 2018 survey of 4,000 Canadian millennials by Abacus Data found that 54% of the people asked favored socialism and 46% capitalism. Most want to address climate change, alleviate poverty, and adopt a more open immigration policy, but most important were micro-economic concerns, such as housing affordability, the cost of living, healthcare, and job-market uncertainties.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":8" /> Housing affordability is a key political issue for young Canadians, regardless of where they live, urban, suburban, or rural Canada. Because clear majorities are in favor of government interventionism, they generally tolerate deficit spending.<ref name=":6" />

According to Sean Simpsons of [[Ipsos]], people are more likely to vote when they have more at stake, such as children to raise, homes to maintain, and income taxes to pay.<ref name=":8" />

The period between the middle to the late twentieth century could be described as an era of 'mass politics', meaning people were generally loyal to a chosen political party. Political debates were mostly about economic questions, such as wealth redistribution, taxation, jobs, and the role of government. But as countries transitioned from having industrial economies to a post-industrial and globalized world, and as the twentieth century became the twenty-first, topics of political discourse changed to other questions and polarization due to competing values intensified. While this new period of political evolution was taking place, a new cohort of voters—Millennials—entered the scene and these people tend to think differently about the old issues than their elders. Moreover, they are less inclined than previous generations to identify (strongly) with a particular political party.<ref name=":30">{{Cite book|last1=Eatwell|first1=Roger|title=National Populism – The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew|publisher=Pelican Book|year=2018|isbn=978-0-241-31200-1|location=Great Britain|chapter=Chapter 6: De-alignment}}</ref>

But scholars such as [[Ronald Inglehart]] traced the roots of this new 'culture conflict' all the way back to the 1960s, which witnessed the emergence of the Baby Boomers, who were generally university-educated middle-class voters. Whereas their predecessors in the twentieth century—the Lost Generation, the Greatest Generation, and the Silent Generation—had to endure severe poverty and world wars, focused on economic stability or simple survival, the Baby Boomers benefited from an economically secure, if not affluent, upbringing and as such tended to be drawn to 'post-materialist' values. Major topics for political discussion at that time were things like the sexual revolution, civil rights, nuclear weaponry, ethnocultural diversity, environmental protection, European integration, and the concept of 'global citizenship'. Some mainstream parties, especially the social democrats, moved to the left in order to accommodate these voters. In the twenty-first century, supporters of post-materialism lined up behind causes such as LGBT rights, climate change, multiculturalism, and various [[Media activism|political campaigns on social media]]. Inglehart called this the "Silent Revolution." But not everyone approved, giving rise to what Piero Ignazi called the "Silent Counter-Revolution."<ref name=":30" /> The university-educated and non-degree holders have very different upbringing, live very different lives, and as such hold very different values.<ref name=":37">{{Cite book|last1=Eatwell|first1=Roger|title=National Populism – The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew|publisher=Pelican Book|year=2018|isbn=978-0-241-31200-1|location=Great Britain|chapter=Chapter 3: Distrust}}</ref> Education plays a role in this 'culture conflict' as national populism appeals most strongly to those who finished high school but did not graduate from university while the experience of higher education has been shown to be linked to having a socially liberal mindset. Degree holders tend to favor tolerance, individual rights, and group identities whereas non-degree holders lean towards conformity, and maintaining order, customs, and traditions.<ref name=":32" /> While the number of university-educated Western voters continues to grow, in many democracies non-degree holders still form a large share of the electorate. According to the OECD, in 2016, the average share of voters between the ages of 25 and 64 without tertiary education in the European Union was 66% of the population. In Italy, it exceeded 80%. In many major democracies, such as France, although the representation of women and ethnic minorities in the corridors of power has increased, the same cannot be said for the working-class and non-degree holders.<ref name=":37" />

By analyzing voter data, political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin came to the conclusion that the popular narrative that the rise of national-populist movements seen across much of the Western world is due largely to angry old white men who would soon be replaced by younger and more liberal voters is flawed. In many European democracies, national-populist politicians and political parties tend to be the most popular among voters below the age of 40. In France, [[Marine Le Pen]] and her [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]] (formerly the National Front) won more votes from people between the ages of 18 and 35 during the first round of the 2017 Presidential election than any other candidates. In Italy, [[Matteo Salvini]] and his [[Lega Nord|League]] have a base of support with virtually no generational gap. In Austria, more than one in two men between the ages of 18 and 29 voted for the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] in 2016. The [[Alternative for Germany]]'s strongest support came not from senior citizens but voters between 25 and 50 years of age. The [[Sweden Democrats]] were the second most popular political party for voters aged 18 to 24 and the most popular for those between 35 and 54 in 2018.<ref name=":32">{{Cite book|last1=Eatwell|first1=Roger|title=National Populism – The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew|publisher=Pelican Book|year=2018|isbn=978-0-241-31200-1|location=Great Britain|chapter=Chapter 1: Myths|author-link=Roger Eatwell|author-link2=Matthew Goodwin}}</ref>

Millennials in the U.S. were initially not keen on getting a driver's license or owning a vehicle thanks to new licensing laws and the state of the economy when they came of age, but the oldest among them have already begun buying cars in great numbers. In 2016, Millennials purchased more cars and trucks than any living generation except the Baby Boomers; in fact, Millennials overtook Baby Boomers in car ownership in California that year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/e79c1cee3730465d95f4e133239ca14b|title=Millennials are finally arriving in the car market|last=Durbin|first=Dee-Ann|date=March 9, 2016|work=Associated Press|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> A working paper by economists Christopher Knittel and Elizabeth Murphy then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] analyzed data from the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Household Transportation Survey, the U.S. Census Bureau, and American Community Survey in order to compare the driving habits of the Baby Boomers, Generation X, and the oldest millennials (born between 1980 and 1984). That found that on the surface, the popular story is true: American Millennials on average own 0.4 fewer cars than their elders. But when various factors—including income, marital status, number of children, and geographical location—were taken into account, such a distinction ceased to be. In addition, once those factors are accounted for, millennials actually drive longer distances than the Baby Boomers. Economic forces, namely low gasoline prices, higher income, and suburban growth, result in millennials having an attitude towards cars that is no different from that of their predecessors. An analysis of the National Household Travel Survey by the State Smart Transportation Initiative revealed that higher-income millennials drive less than their peers probably because they are able to afford the higher costs of living in large cities, where they can take advantage of alternative modes of transportation, including public transit and ride-hailing services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/03/millennial-car-ownership-driving-behavior-vehicle-data/585667/|title=Despite 'Car-Free' Hype, Millennials Drive a Lot|last=Bliss|first=Laura|date=March 27, 2019|work=CityLab|access-date=November 3, 2019|department=Transportation}}</ref>

Urban researcher Richard Florida and his colleague Charlotta Mellander studied data from the American Community Survey's five-year estimates for 2017 covering all 382 U.S. metropolitan areas and developed a Metro Car-free Index based on the percentages of households that do not own a vehicle, and of commuters who ride public transit, bike, or walk to work. They found that the largest clusters of metropolitan areas in which it was feasible to not own a car were the [[Northeast Corridor]] (Boston to Washington, D.C.) and the [[Pacific Northwest Corridor]] (Seattle to Portland, Oregon). Outside of these, there were [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicagoland]] and Los Angeles County. All of these places were densely populated with high costs of living. Mellander discovered that living in a car-free metropolitan area was positively correlated with having university degrees (.54), and being a member of the creative class (.48), while negatively correlated with being a member of the working class (.45).

Between the late 1990s and the early 2000s, religious attendance nosedived 40% throughout England except in London, where 57% of Christians were in their 20s.

According to a 2007 study, across Europe, many young Muslims were finding themselves attracted by transnational Islam; those under the age of 25 were more likely to support Muslim-only schools, and Sharia law, and to condone violence to defend their religion than their counterparts over the age of 55. Immigration from the Middle East and Africa is an engine of religious growth in Europe. Children of immigrants tend to be about as religious as their parents and consider their religion to be a marker of their ethnic identity, thereby insulating themselves from the secularizing forces of the host society. Religion can indeed grow even in otherwise secular societies, and such religious demographic changes will bring about social and political ramifications later in the century.<ref name=":21" />

A 2017 study conducted by the Pew Research Center on 70 countries showed that between 2010 and 2015, among people aged 15 to 29, the irreligious grew by 23%, Muslims 0.3%, while Christians lost 0.7% due to religious conversion or switching. In particular, the unaffiliated gained eight million people and Muslims half a million while Christians lost nine million due to religious switching.<ref name=":11" />

=== Social circles ===
In March 2014, the Pew Research Center issued a report about how "millennials in adulthood" are "detached from institutions and networked with friends." The report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than older adults about America's future, with 49% of millennials saying the country's best years are ahead, though they're the first in the modern era to have higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment.<ref name="Pew">{{cite web|date=7 March 2014|title=Millennials in Adulthood – Detached from Institutions, Networked with Friends|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2014/03/2014-03-07_generations-report-version-for-web.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827083641/http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2014/03/2014-03-07_generations-report-version-for-web.pdf|archive-date=27 August 2018}}</ref><ref name="Millennials in Adulthood">{{cite web|date=7 March 2014|title=Millennials in Adulthood|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/|work=Pew Research Center's Social & Demographic Trends Project}}</ref>

Writing for ''The Atlantic'' in 2018, Kate Julian reported that among the countries that kept track of the sexual behavior of their citizens—Australia, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States—all saw a decline in the frequency of sexual intercourse among teenagers and young adults. Although experts disagree on the methodology of data analysis, they do believe that young people today are less sexually engaged than their elders, such as the baby boomers, when they were their age. This is despite the fact that online dating platforms allow for the possibility of casual sex, the wide availability of contraception, and the relaxation of attitudes towards sex outside of marriage.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Julian|first=Kate|date=December 2018|title=Why Are Young People Having So Little Sex?|work=The Atlantic|department=Culture|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/the-sex-recession/573949/|access-date=September 2, 2020}}</ref>

In a 2019 poll, the Pew Research Center found that about 47% American adults believed dating had become more difficult within the last decade or so, while only 19% said it became easier and 33% thought it was the same. Majorities of both men (65%) and women (43%) agreed that the 'Me-too' movement posed challenges for the dating market while 24% and 38%, respectively, thought it made no difference. In all, one in two of single adults were not looking for a romantic relationship. Among the rest, 10% were only interested in casual relationships, 14% wanted committed relationships only, and 26% were open to either kinds.<ref name=":49">{{Cite web|last=Brown|first=Anna|date=August 20, 2020|title=Nearly Half of U.S. Adults Say Dating Has Gotten Harder for Most People in the Last 10 Years|url=https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/08/20/nearly-half-of-u-s-adults-say-dating-has-gotten-harder-for-most-people-in-the-last-10-years/|access-date=August 21, 2020|website=Pew Research Center}}</ref> Among younger people (18 to 39), 27% wanted a committed relationship only, 15% casual dates only, and 58% either types of relationship.

While most Americans found their romantic partners with the help of friends and family, younger adults were more likely to encounter them online than their elders, with 21% of those aged 18 to 29 and 15% of those aged 30 to 49 saying they met their current partners this way. For comparison, only 8% of those aged 50 to 64 and 5% of those aged 65 and over did the same. People aged 18 to 29 were most likely to have met their current partners in school while adults aged 50 and up were more likely to have met their partners at work. Among those in the 18 to 29 age group, 41% were single, including 51% of men and 32% of women. Among those in the 30 to 49 age group, 23% were single, including 27% of men and 19% of women. This reflects the general trend across the generations that men tend to marry later (and die earlier) than women.<ref name=":50" />

Most single people, regardless of whether or not they were interested in dating, felt little to no pressure from their friends and family to seek a romantic partner. Young people, however, were under significant pressure compared to the sample average or older age groups. 53% of bachelors and spinsters aged 18 to 29 thought there was at least some pressure from society on them to find a partner, compared to 42% for people aged 30 to 49, 32% for people aged 50 to 64, and 21% for people aged 50 to 64.<ref name=":49" />

A 2020 study published in the [[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA) by researchers from [[Indiana University]] in the United States and the [[Karolinska Institute|Karolinska Institutet]] from Sweden found that during the first two decades of the twenty-first century, young Americans had sexual intercourse less frequently than in the past. Among men aged 18 to 24, the share of the sexually inactive increased from 18.9% between 2000 and 2002 to 30.9% between 2016 and 2018. Women aged 18 to 34 had sex less often as well. Reasons for this trend are manifold. People who were unemployed, only had part-time jobs, and students were the most likely to forego sexual experience while those who had higher income were more selective in [[Human mating strategies|mate selection]]. Psychologist Jean Twenge, who did not participate in the study, suggested that this might be due to "a broader cultural trend toward delayed development," meaning various adult activities are postponed. She noted that being economically dependent on one's parents discourages sexual intercourse. Other researchers noted that the rise of the Internet, computer games, and social media could play a role, too, since older and married couples also had sex less often. In short, people had many options. A 2019 study by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine|London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] found a similar trend in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Woodyatt|first=Amy|date=June 15, 2020|title=Young Americans are having less sex than ever|work=CNN|department=Health|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/health/young-americans-less-sex-intl-scli-wellness/index.html|access-date=September 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>Ueda P, Mercer CH, Ghaznavi C, Herbenick D.

Research by the [[Urban Institute]] conducted in 2014, projected that if current trends continue, millennials will have a lower marriage rate compared to previous generations, predicting that by age 40, 31% of millennial women will remain single, approximately twice the share of their single Gen X counterparts.

Data also showed a significant increase in the percentage of young adults living with parents compared to the previous demographic cohort, [[Generation X]], with 23% of young adults aged 18–34 living with parents in 2000, rising to 32% in 2014. Additionally, in 2000, 43% of those aged 18–34 were married or living with a partner, with this figure dropping to 32% in 2014. High student debt is described as one reason for continuing to live with parents, but may not be the dominant factor for this shift as the data shows the trend is stronger for those without a college education. Richard Fry, a senior economist for Pew Research said of millennials, "they're the group much more likely to live with their parents," further stating that "they're concentrating more on school, careers and work and less focused on forming new families, spouses or partners and children."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://latimes.com/business/la-fi-millennials-live-at-home-20160524-snap-story.html|title=More young adults live with parents than partners, a first|date=24 May 2016|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=31 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/05/24/for-first-time-in-modern-era-living-with-parents-edges-out-other-living-arrangements-for-18-to-34-year-olds/|title=For First Time in Modern Era, Living With Parents Edges Out Other Living Arrangements for 18- to 34-Year-Olds|last1=Fry|first1=Richard|date=24 May 2016|access-date=31 May 2016|publisher=Pew Research}}</ref>[[File:Dad with a Bjorn.jpg|thumb|270x270px|A young father with a baby in Stockholm, Sweden (2015).|alt=]]According to a cross-generational study comparing millennials to Generation X conducted at [[Wharton School of Business]], more than half of millennial undergraduates surveyed do not plan to have children.

But as their economic prospects improve, most millennials in the United States say they desire marriage, children, and home ownership.<ref name=":2" /> Geopolitical analyst [[Peter Zeihan]] argued that because of the size of the millennial cohort relative to the size of the U.S. population and because they are having children, the United States will continue to maintain an economic advantage over most other developed nations, whose millennial cohorts are not only smaller than their those of their elders but are also not having as high a fertility rate. The prospects of any given country is constrained by its demography.<ref name=":410" /> Psychologist Jean Twenge and a colleague's analysis of data from the General Social Survey of 40,000 Americans aged 30 and over from the 1970s to the 2010s suggests that socioeconomic status (as determined by factors such as income, educational attainment, and occupational prestige), marriage, and happiness are positive correlated and that these relationships are independent of cohort or age.

==Workplace attitudes==
In 2010 the ''[[Journal of Business and Psychology]],'' contributors Myers and Sadaghiani find millennials "expect close relationships and frequent feedback from supervisors" to be a main point of differentiation.<ref name="Myers and Sadaghiani">{{cite journal|last1=Myers|first1=Karen K.|last2=Sadaghiani|first2=Kamyab|title=Millennials in the Workplace: A Communication Perspective on Millennials' Organizational Relationships and Performance|journal=Journal of Business and Psychology|date=1 January 2010|volume=25|issue=2|pages=225–238|doi=10.1007/s10869-010-9172-7|pmid=20502509|jstor=40605781|pmc=2868990}}</ref> Multiple studies observe millennials’ associating job satisfaction with free flow of information, strong connectivity to supervisors, and more immediate feedback.<ref name="Myers and Sadaghiani" /> Hershatter and Epstein, researchers from [[Emory University]], argue many these traits can be linked to millennials entering the educational system on the cusp of academic reform, which created a much more structured educational system.<ref name="Hershatter and Epstein">{{cite journal|last1=Hershatter|first1=Andrea|last2=Epstein|first2=Molly|title=Millennials and the World of Work: An Organization and Management Perspective|journal=Journal of Business and Psychology|date=1 January 2010|volume=25|issue=2|pages=211–223|doi=10.1007/s10869-010-9160-y|jstor=40605780|s2cid=145517471}}</ref> Some argue in the wake of these reforms, such as the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], millennials have increasingly sought the aid of mentors and advisers, leading to 66% of millennials seeking a flat work environment.<ref name="Hershatter and Epstein" />

Hershatter and Epstein also stress a growing importance on work-life balance. Studies show nearly one-third of students' top priority is to "balance personal and professional life".<ref name="Hershatter and Epstein" /> The Brain Drain Study shows nearly 9 out of 10 millennials place an importance on work-life balance, with additional surveys demonstrating the generation to favor familial over corporate values.<ref name="Hershatter and Epstein" /> Studies also show a preference for work-life balance, which contrasts to the Baby Boomers' work-centric attitude.<ref name="Myers and Sadaghiani" />

Data also suggests millennials are driving a shift towards the public service sector. In 2010, Myers and Sadaghiani published research in the ''Journal of Business and Psychology'' stating heightened participation in the [[Peace Corps]] and [[AmeriCorps]] as a result of millennials, with volunteering being at all-time highs.<ref name="Myers and Sadaghiani" /> Volunteer activity between 2007 and 2008 show the millennial age group experienced almost three-times the increase of the overall population, which is consistent with a survey of 130 college upperclassmen depicting an emphasis on altruism in their upbringing.<ref name="Myers and Sadaghiani" /> This has led, according to a Harvard University Institute of Politics, six out of ten millennials to consider a career in public service.<ref name="Myers and Sadaghiani" />

The 2014 Brookings publication shows a generational adherence to corporate social responsibility, with the National Society of High School Scholars (NSHSS) 2013 survey and Universum's 2011 survey, depicting a preference to work for companies engaged in the betterment of society.<ref name="Brookings">{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-millennials-could-upend-wall-street-and-corporate-america/|title=How Millennials Could Upend Wall Street and Corporate America |last1=Winograd|first1=Morley|last2=Hais|first2=Michael|date=November 30, 2001|publisher=Brookings Institution}}</ref> Millennials' shift in attitudes has led to data depicting 64% of millennials would take a 60% pay cut to pursue a career path aligned with their passions, and financial institutions have fallen out of favor with banks comprising 40% of the generation's least liked brands.<ref name="Brookings" />

In 2008, author Ron Alsop called the millennials "Trophy Kids,"<ref name="Alsop08" /> a term that reflects a trend in competitive sports, as well as many other aspects of life, where mere participation is frequently enough for a reward.

There is also a contention that the major differences are found solely between millennials and Generation X. Researchers from the [[University of Missouri]] and The [[University of Tennessee]] conducted a study based on measurement equivalence to determine if such a difference does in fact exist.<ref name="MWEP">{{cite journal|last1=Meriac|first1=John P.|last2=Woehr|first2=David J.|last3=Banister|first3=Christina|title=Generational Differences in Work Ethic: An Examination of Measurement Equivalence Across Three Cohorts|journal=Journal of Business and Psychology|date=1 January 2010|volume=25|issue=2|pages=315–324|doi=10.1007/s10869-010-9164-7|jstor=40605789|s2cid=144303965}}</ref> The study looked at 1,860 participants who had completed the Multidimensional Work Ethic Profile (MWEP), a survey aimed at measuring identification with work-ethic characteristics, across a 12-year period spanning from 1996 to 2008.<ref name="MWEP" /> The results of the findings suggest the main difference in work ethic sentiments arose between the two most recent generational cohorts, Generation X and millennials, with relatively small variances between the two generations and their predecessor, the Baby Boomers.<ref name="MWEP" />

A meta study conducted by researchers from The [[George Washington University]] and The [[U.S. Army]] Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences questions the validity of workplace differences across any generational cohort. According to the researchers, disagreement in which events to include when assigning generational cohorts, as well as varied opinions on which age ranges to include in each generational category are the main drivers behind their skepticism.<ref name="Workplace Meta Study">{{cite journal|last1=Costanza|first1=David P.|last2=Badger|first2=Jessica M.|last3=Fraser|first3=Rebecca L.|last4=Severt|first4=Jamie B.|last5=Gade|first5=Paul A.|title=Generational Differences in Work-Related Attitudes: A Meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Business and Psychology|date=1 January 2012|volume=27|issue=4|pages=375–394|doi=10.1007/s10869-012-9259-4|jstor=41682990|s2cid=143594067}}</ref> The analysis of 20 research reports focusing on the three work-related factors of job satisfaction, organizational commitment and intent to turn over proved any variation was too small to discount the impact of employee tenure and aging of individuals.<ref name="Workplace Meta Study" /> Newer research shows that millennials change jobs for the same reasons as other generations—namely, more money and a more innovative work environment. They look for versatility and flexibility in the workplace, and strive for a strong work–life balance in their jobs<ref>{{cite web|first=Karen|last=Roberts|url=http://www.lwdirect.com/millennial-workers-want-free-meals-and-flex-time/|title=Millennial Workers Want Free Meals and Flex Time|date=8 April 2015}}</ref> and have similar career aspirations to other generations, valuing financial security and a diverse workplace just as much as their older colleagues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/gb/en/gbe03649usen/GBE03649USEN.PDF|title=Myths, Exaggerations and Uncomfortable Truths – The Real Story Behind Millennials in the Workplace|website=Public.DHE.IBM.com|publisher=[[IBM]]|access-date=27 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004080534/http://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/gb/en/gbe03649usen/GBE03649USEN.PDF|archive-date=4 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Use of digital technology==
[[File:Digital media use.jpg|thumb|People using [[smartphone]]s, devices associated with millennials]]
[[Marc Prensky]] coined the term "[[digital native]]" to describe "K through college" students in 2001, explaining they "represent the first generations to grow up with this new technology."<ref name="Prensky">{{cite web|url=http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf|title=Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants|last=Prensky|first=Marc|publisher=MCB University Press|access-date=6 November 2013}}</ref> In their 2007 book ''Connecting to the Net.Generation: What Higher Education Professionals Need to Know About Today's Students'', authors Reynol Junco and Jeanna Mastrodicasa expanded on the work of William Strauss and Neil Howe to include research-based information about the personality profiles of millennials, especially as it relates to higher education. They conducted a large-sample (7,705) research study of [[college]] [[student]]s. They found that Net Generation college students, born 1982 onwards, were frequently in touch with their parents and they used [[technology]] at higher rates than people from [[List of generations|other generations]]. In their survey, they found that 97% of these students owned a [[computer]], 94% owned a [[mobile phone]], and 56% owned an [[MP3 player]]. They also found that students spoke with their parents an average of 1.5 times a day about a wide range of topics. Other findings in the Junco and Mastrodicasa survey revealed 76% of students used [[instant messaging]], 92% of those reported [[Human multitasking|multitasking]] while instant messaging, 40% of them used [[television]] to get most of their news, and 34% of students surveyed used the [[Internet]] as their primary news source.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8t4GQAACAAJ |title=Connecting to the Net.Generation: What Higher Education Professionals Need to Know About Today's Students|last1=Junco|first1=Reynol|last2=Mastrodicasa|first2=Jeanna|publisher=National Association of Student Personnel Administrators|year=2007|isbn=978-0-931654-48-0|access-date=6 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Berk|first=Ronald A.|year=2009|title=How Do You Leverage the Latest Technologies, including Web 2.0 Tools, in Your Classroom?|url=http://www.ronberk.com/articles/2010_leverage.pdf|journal=International Journal of Technology in Teaching and Learning|volume=6|issue=1|page=4|access-date=2 September 2010}}</ref>

One of the most popular forms of media use by millennials is [[social networking]]. Millennials use social networking sites, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], to create a different sense of belonging, make acquaintances, and to remain connected with friends.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Youth and Generation|last=Woodman|first=Dan|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd|year=2015|isbn=978-1446259054|location=London|pages=132}}</ref> In 2010, research was published in the Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research which claimed that students who used [[social media]] and decided to quit showed the same withdrawal symptoms of a drug addict who quit their stimulant.<ref>Cabral, J.

A 2015 study found that the frequency of [[Near-sightedness|nearsightedness]] has doubled in the United Kingdom within the last 50 years. Ophthalmologist Steve Schallhorn, chairman of the Optical Express International Medical Advisory Board, noted that research have pointed to a link between the regular use of handheld electronic devices and eyestrain. The [[American Optometric Association]] sounded the alarm on a similar vein.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/ct-child-vision-problem-computer-balancing-20150716-column.html#nt=standard-embed|title=Too much screen time could be damaging kids' eyesight|last=Stevens|first=Heidi|date=July 16, 2015|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=September 8, 2019}}</ref> According to a spokeswoman, digital eyestrain, or [[computer vision syndrome]], is "rampant, especially as we move toward smaller devices and the prominence of devices increase in our everyday lives."

In order to alleviate or prevent eyestrain, the [[The Vision Council|Vision Council]] recommends that people limit screen time, take frequent breaks, adjust screen brightness, change the background from bright colors to gray, increase text sizes, and blinking more often.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/25/digital-eye-strain/4491611/|title=Digital device use leads to eye strain, even in kids|last=Hellmich|first=Nanci|date=January 25, 2014|work=USA Today|access-date=September 8, 2019}}</ref>
