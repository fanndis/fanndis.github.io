'''Engie SA''' is a French multinational [[electric utility]] company, headquartered in [[La Défense]], [[Courbevoie]], which operates in the fields of [[energy transition]], [[electricity generation]] and [[electricity distribution|distribution]], [[natural gas]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[renewable energy]] and [[petroleum]].

It is one of the few players in the sector to develop expert skills in both upstream (engineering, purchasing, operation, maintenance) and downstream (waste management, dismantling) activities.

The company, formed on 22 July 2008 by the [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] of [[Gaz de France]] and [[Suez (company)|Suez]], traces its origins to the [[Suez Canal Company|Universal Suez Canal Company]] founded in 1858 to construct the [[Suez Canal]].

As of 2018, ENGIE employs 158,505 people worldwide with revenues of €60.6 billion.

ENGIE is listed on the [[Euronext]] exchanges in [[Euronext Paris|Paris]] and [[Brussels Stock Exchange|Brussels]] and is a constituent of the [[CAC 40]] and [[BEL20]] indices.

ENGIE was headed from 2016 to 2020 by [[Isabelle Kocher]], who has strongly transformed the company since 2016, notably by deciding to exit coal activities and by investing massively in renewable energies and energy transition services.

During its General Meeting on 14 May 2020, ENGIE's [[Board of directors|Board of Directors]] has approved its purpose statement which is "to act to accelerate the transition towards a carbon-neutral economy, through reduced energy consumption and more environmentally-friendly solutions".<ref>{{Cite web|title=ENGIE unveils its purpose statement for inclusion in its bylaws {{!}} ENGIE|url=https://www.engie.com/en/journalists/press-releases/engie-unveils-its-purpose-statement|website=Engie.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref>

==History==
===Background (before 2006)===
{{See also|Suez (company)|Gaz de France}}
Prior to the GDF Suez merger plans in 2006, the company existed as two separate French multinational corporations - [[Suez S.A.]] and [[Gaz de France]].

Suez was (and still remains, through GDF Suez) one of the oldest continuously existing multinational corporations in the world as the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers. One line of corporate history dates back to the 1822 founded ''Algemeene Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter begunstiging van de volksvlijt'' (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King [[William I of the Netherlands]] (see [[Société Générale de Belgique]]). The origin of its name 'Suez' traces back to its other founding entity – the ''[[Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez]]'' founded in 1858 to build the Suez Canal. Suez S.A. was the result of a 1997 merger between the ''[[Compagnie de Suez]]'' and ''[[:fr:Lyonnaise des Eaux|Lyonnaise des Eaux]]''.

Gaz de France was created in 1946 along with its sister company [[Électricité de France]] (EDF) by the [[Cabinet of France|French Government]]. After the liberalisation of Europe's energy markets, Gaz de France also entered into the [[electricity]] sector, having developed combined natural gas-electricity offerings. The company's capital was [[Initial public offering|partially floated]] on the [[Euronext Paris|Paris Stock Exchange]] in July 2005, raising €2.5 billion for the [[Cabinet of France|French Government]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&sid=agF4FhEQmRPA&refer=europe|title=Gaz de France Shares Jump After Public Offering|last=Moya|first=Elena|date=8 July 2008|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|access-date=12 July 2008}}</ref>

=== Evolution of GDF Suez (2006 - 2008)===

On 25 February 2006, French Prime minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] announced the [[mergers and acquisitions|merger]] of [[water supply]] and [[water treatment|treatment]], [[waste management]] and [[energy (society)|energy]] company [[Suez (company)|Suez]] and power firm [[Gaz de France]], with the aim of creating the world's largest [[liquefied natural gas]] company.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&objet_id=935728&clef=ARC-TRK-D_01|title=Dominique de Villepin a annoncé un projet de fusion entre Gaz de France et Suez|date=25 February 2006|work=[[Le Monde]]|language=French|access-date=12 July 2008}}</ref> Since the French state owned over 80% of Gaz de France, it was necessary to pass a new law in order to make the merger possible.

=== GDF Suez (2008 - 2015)===
The newly created GDF Suez came into existence on 22 July 2008; the world's second-largest [[public utility|utility]] with over €74 billion in annual revenues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKL0113342620080701|title=Suez shares to exit French CAC-40 July 22|last=Vidalon|first=Dominique|date=1 July 2008|agency=[[Reuters]]|access-date=12 July 2008}}</ref> The deal resulted in the conversion of the French state's 80% stake in GDF into just over 35% of shares of the new company. The water and waste assets which formerly formed part of Suez were spun off into a new publicly traded company, [[Suez Environment]], in which GDF Suez retains a stake.

In 1975, Ruhrgas and Gaz de France concluded a deal according to which they agreed not to sell gas in each other's home market. The deal was abandoned in 2005.<ref name=ft080709/>

In July 2009, the [[European Commission]] fined GDF Suez and [[E.ON]] €553&nbsp;million both over arrangements on the [[MEGAL pipeline]].<ref name=ft080709>

=== GDF Suez becomes ENGIE: 2015 - present ===
On 24 April 2015 GDF Suez announced it was changing its name to "ENGIE", in an effort to further expand the company's international footprint. CEO and Chairman Gérard Mestrallet said the new name was a symbol to meet the challenges of the energy transition and accelerate the group's development.<ref>{{Cite news|title=GDF Suez announces corporate rebranding, becomes ENGIE |url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2015/05/gdf-suez-announces-corporate-rebranding-becomes-engie.html |agency=Hydroworld.com |date=5 May 2015 }}</ref> The subsidiary International Power became [[Engie Energy International]].

In July 2015, ENGIE acquired 95% of Solairedirect, raising its photovoltaic production from 125 to 486 MW.

On 2 March 2017, ENGIE acquired Keepmoat Regeneration for £330m to form the places and communities division, headed up by Keepmoat LTD's former CEO Dave Sheridan. The new division is focused on three key activities; energy, services and regeneration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2017/03/02/keepmoat-offloads-regeneration-arm-for-330m/|title=Keepmoat offloads regeneration arm for £330m {{!}} Construction Enquirer|website=www.constructionenquirer.com|access-date=2018-01-22}}</ref>

In April 2019, Engie announced the acquisition of 90% of Transportadora Associada de Gás (TAG), Brazil's largest natural gas transmission system owner (2,800 miles of pipeline, 47% of the country's gas infrastructure), for €7.7 billion.

It is the largest acquisition since International Power in 2010. The operation allows Engie to develop on its strategic axis of energy infrastructure as well as in Brazil, one of the priority countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.breakingviews.com/considered-view/engie-gets-the-gas-but-without-the-gearing/|title=Engie gets the gas but without the gearing|date=8 April 2019|website=Breaking Views|publisher=Reuters|access-date=2 August 2018}}</ref>

==Strategy==

===Transformation of the company's business===

Since 2014, ENGIE has operated a strategic shift, by reducing future exploration in fossil fuels and investing massively in renewable energies (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, hydroelectric, and nuclear) and energy efficiency services.

In 2015, ENGIE announced its decision to stop new investments in coal plants and to dispose of €15 billion in assets in order to reinvest into projects that promote low-carbon, distributed-energy. ENGIE also announced it will invest €22bn in renewable energies, energy services such as heating and cooling networks, and decentralized energy technology.

In 2016, [[Isabelle Kocher]] defines the strategy of ENGIE as follows: to promote decarbonized energy (oil and coal replaced by renewables and natural gas that emit less greenhouse gases), decentralized energy (energy produced and stored as close as possible to its place of consumption), and digitized energy (big data and digital tools for energy efficiency and network management). The Group creates [[ENGIE Digital]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.engie.com/|title=ENGIE Digital|website=digital.engie.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Isabelle Kocher: "We draw our inspiration from the major players in the digital world"|url=https://www.engie.com/en/group/opinions/usine-nouvelle-isabelle-kocher/ |agency=ENGIE |date=3 November 2016 }}</ref> and plans to invest €1.5 billion on digital and new technologies related to energy.

ENGIE is also promoting an open innovation approach with its dedicated entity "ENGIE Fab" that supports in particular development of intelligent networks (smart grids), Internet of objects, green mobility, energy storage, and hydrogen.<ref>{{Cite news|title=In the Energy Revolution, a Giant Changes Course |url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/energy-revolution-giant-changes-course |agency=Stanford Business |date=24 July 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=France's Engie Warns of Cheap Oil at Expense of Renewables |url=https://financialtribune.com/articles/energy/57140/frances-engie-warns-of-cheap-oil-at-expense-of-renewables |agency=financialtribune.com |date=9 January 2017 }}</ref>

Between 2016 and 2018, ENGIE invested €15 billion in new activities, financed by the sale of coal and upstream oil and gas.

===2019-2021 strategic plan===

In 2019, Isabelle Kocher announces the strategic plan of the company for the 2019-2021 period, with an ambition to become the world leader in the zero-carbon transition. The strategic shift includes accelerating its investments in renewable energies and focusing on high-value-added services to the clients.

Isabelle Kocher announces the definitive exit of coal activities. Engie plans to invest another €12 billion in renewable activities, partly financed by the sale of €6 billion assets (including the last coal plants).

The 12 billion break down as follows: 3 to 3.3 billion into gas infrastructure; 4 to 5 billion into client services and solutions{{buzzword inline|date=November 2019}}; and 2.3 to 2.8 billion into renewable energies,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Engie poursuit sa mue vers les renouvelables|url=https://www.lopinion.fr/edition/economie/engie-poursuit-mue-vers-renouvelables-179410|agency=L'opinion|date=28 February 2019 }}</ref> adding a 9 GWH production capacity, to reach a renewable installed capacity of 52 to 64 GW by 2026.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Engie accentue son recentrage sur les services et les énergies vertes|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/industrie-services/energie-environnement/engie-veut-accelerer-apres-une-annee-2018-decevante-994703|agency=les Echos|date=28 February 2019 }}</ref>

As far as the services are concerned, Isabelle Kocher's plan is to develop "energy transition as a service"<ref>{{Cite news|title=Isabelle Kocher: "Engie a un très gros potentiel de création de valeur"|url=https://www.lopinion.fr/edition/economie/isabelle-kocher-engie-a-tres-gros-potentiel-creation-valeur-179516|agency=L'opinion|date=3 March 2019 }}</ref> for large companies and metropolises, whom she says are driving the "second wave of energy transition" by searching ways to reduce their carbon emissions (the first wave having been driven by the states). She also says it might be "the invention of a new industry" of a 1 billion dollar potential value.<ref>{{Cite news|title=French energy company Engie to pull out of 20 countries|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a0706b48-3b1a-11e9-b72b-2c7f526ca5d0|agency=Financial Times|date=28 February 2019 }}</ref>
