'''Azealia Amanda Banks''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|z|i:|l|i|ə}}; born May 31, 1991) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and actress. Raised in the [[Harlem]] neighborhood of New York City, she began releasing music through [[Myspace]] in 2008 before being signed to [[XL Recordings]] at age 18. In 2011, her debut single "[[212 (song)|212]]" went [[Viral video|viral]] and entered several international charts. Banks subsequently signed with [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] and [[Polydor Records]] before later separating in July 2013. Banks ultimately became an independent artist and started her own independent record label, ''Chaos & Glory Recordings'', after multiple negative experiences with previous labels.

Banks has released two mixtapes (''[[Fantasea (mixtape)|Fantasea]]'' in 2012 and ''[[Slay-Z]]'' in 2016), one studio album (''[[Broke with Expensive Taste]]'' in 2014), and two extended plays (''[[1991 (EP)|1991]]'' in 2012 and ''[[Icy Colors Change]]'' in 2018). Her long-delayed second and third studio albums, ''Fantasea II: The Second Wave'' and ''Business & Pleasure'', await release. The lead singles from each respective album, "[[Anna Wintour (song)|Anna Wintour]]" and "[[Black Madonna (Azealia Banks song)|Black Madonna]]" were released in April 2018 and June 2020 respectively.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8293135/azealia-banks-discusses-house-inspired-single-anna-wintour-fantasea-ii-state-of-women-hip-hop|title=Azealia Banks Talks House-Inspired 'Anna Wintour' Single, 'Fantasea II' Album & State of Women in Hip-Hop|work=Billboard|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Ones: Azealia Banks' "Black Madonna" [ft.

Throughout her career, Banks's [[social media]] presence and outspoken views, especially on [[U.S. Politics|U.S. politics]] and [[Race (human categorization)|race]], have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny. She has developed a reputation for having disputes with public figures on [[Twitter]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name="The Independent">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/azealia-banks-a-brief-history-of-the-rappers-public-feuds-and-tirades-a7026016.html|title=A brief history of Azealia Banks public feuds|work=The Independent|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref>

==Life and career==

===Early life and career beginnings===
Azealia Amanda Banks was born on May 31, 1991, in New York City's [[Manhattan]] borough; she was the youngest of three girls.<ref name="xxlmag22ndbirthday">{{cite web|last=Diep|first=Eric|title=Today in Hip-Hop: Azealia Banks Celebrates 22nd Birthday|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/hip-hop-today/2013/05/today-in-hip-hop-azealia-banks-celebrates-22nd-birthday/|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=May 31, 2013|access-date=August 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=D.L.|url=http://hiphopwired.com/2012/12/24/azealia-banks-hints-at-retirement-promises-2-lps-in-2013-video/|title=Azealia Banks Hints at Retirement, Promises 2 LPs in 2013 [VIDEO]|publisher=Hip-Hop Wired|date=December 24, 2012|access-date=December 30, 2012}}</ref> Her single mother raised her and two older sisters in [[Harlem]], after their father died of [[pancreatic cancer]] when she was two years old.<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite web|author=Ortved, John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/fashion/azealia-banks-a-young-rapper-taking-cues-from-the-street.html?_r=3&ref=fashion&|title=Azealia Banks, a Young Rapper Taking Cues From the Street|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 1, 2012|access-date=November 17, 2012}}</ref> Following her father's death, Banks says that her mother "became really abusive—physically and verbally. Like she would hit me and my sisters with baseball bats, bang our heads up against walls, and she would always tell me I was ugly. I remember once she threw out all the food in the fridge, just so we wouldn't have anything to eat." Due to escalating violence, Banks moved out of her mother's home at age 14 to live with her older sister.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sciortino|first=Karley|title=Azealia Banks: Fighting Talk|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/14493/1/azealia-banks-fighting-talk|magazine=Dazed & Confused|access-date=January 24, 2019|date=September 15, 2012}}</ref>

At a young age Banks became interested in musical theater, dancing, acting and singing. At age 16, she starred in a production of the comedy-noir musical ''[[City of Angels (musical)|City of Angels]]'', where she was found by an agent who sent her to auditions for [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[Nickelodeon]], and ''[[Law & Order]]'', all without success.<ref name="baronspinissuestory">{{cite web|last=Baron|first=Zach|date=August 28, 2012|title=The Making of Azealia Banks|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/08/azealia-banks-spin-issue-story/|access-date=October 28, 2017|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]}}</ref> At this point Banks decided to end her pursuit of an acting career, citing the stiff competition and overall sense of unfulfillment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Azealia Banks interview – BBC Sound of 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc1zevdRivA|publisher=YouTube.com|access-date=January 27, 2013}}</ref> Because of this unfulfillment, she began writing rap and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] songs as a creative outlet. She never finished high school, instead choosing to follow her dream of becoming a recording artist.<ref name="xxlmag22ndbirthday" />  In April 2009, Banks attempted to murder her sister with a box cutter.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=chpyxo|number=1038322601456795648?lang=en|title=Yes.

Under the moniker Miss Bank$, she released her debut recording, "Gimme a Chance", online on November 9, 2008.<ref name="baronspinissuestory" /> The recording was accompanied by the self-produced track "Seventeen", which sampled the [[Ladytron]] song of the [[Seventeen (Ladytron song)|same name]]. Banks sent both tracks to American DJ [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Mlynar |first=Phillip |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2696294/azealia-banks-interview/ |title=Azealia Banks Says She Was Not Discovered By Diplo |publisher=[[MTV Hive]] |date=June 7, 2012 |access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref> Later that year, she signed a [[artist development deal|development deal]] with record label [[XL Recordings]] and began working with producer [[Richard Russell (XL Recordings)|Richard Russell]] in London, leaving the label later that year due to conflicting ideas.<ref name="so12">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2012/artists/azealiabanks/|title=BBC Sound of 2012 – Artist Profile – Azealia Banks|publisher=BBC|date=January 4, 2012}}</ref><ref name="xl">{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/07671-azealia-banks-xl|title=Azealia Banks has pop at XL Recordings|publisher=[[The Quietus]]|date=January 5, 2012}}</ref>

He wound up calling me "amateur" and the XL interns started talking shit about me. It just got real fucking funny. I was like, "I didn't come here for a date. I came here to cut some fucking records." I got turned off on the music industry and disappeared for a bit. I went into a bit of a depression.|salign=right|source=—Banks talking of her departure from XL Recordings<ref name="xl"/>}} After leaving XL Recordings, Banks dropped the 'Miss Bank$' moniker and formally became Azealia Banks, which preceded a move to [[Montreal]]. Using YouTube as a portal, she uploaded several demo tracks, including "L8R" and a cover of "[[Slow Hands (Interpol song)|Slow Hands]]" by [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]]. After her Canadian [[visa (document)|visa]] expired, Banks returned to New York, where she sold keychains at a Manhattan [[jazz club]] and danced at a [[Queens]] strip club to make ends meet.<ref name="baronspinissuestory" /> "That's when I was really depressed", Banks has said. "I don't have a manager, I don't have a boyfriend, I don't have any friends, I don't have any money. Here I am working at the strip club, trying not to say the wrong thing and get into fights with these girls who don't give a shit."<ref name="baronspinissuestory" />

In September 2011, Banks released her debut single, "[[212 (song)|212]]", as a free digital download from her website.

Banks has said she admires American recording artists [[Beyoncé]] and [[Aaliyah]], stating the former "[is] the queen of everything. She's the most remarkable performer and musician. And this is just my humble opinion, but I just think she's better than everyone else making music right now."<ref name="rollingstone" /> Banks is inspired by, and has drawn directly upon, black gay culture, such as the film ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris is Burning]]'', in her music.<ref name="Moore"/>

[[AllMusic]] characterizes Banks as "a stylish vocalist who combines [[hardcore hip-hop]], [[indie pop]], and [[dance music]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/azealia-banks-mn0002837954/biography|title=Azealia Banks {{!}} Biography|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=February 23, 2015}}</ref> Meanwhile, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s John Robinson considered Banks' style "an appealing blend of [[Missy Elliott]] and [[dance-pop]]."<ref>{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/22/this-weeks-new-live-music |title=This week's new live music |work=The Guardian |date=September 21, 2012 |access-date=July 1, 2015}}</ref> In regards to her musical style, Banks has frequently been noted for the use of profanity in many of her songs, particularly her [[reappropriation|reclamation]] of the word "cunt",<ref name="independent">{{cite news|last=Self|first=Will|title=Hothouse Flower|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/t-magazine/culture/azealia-banks-hothouse-flower.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=March 2, 2012|access-date=November 6, 2012}}</ref><ref name="samcam">{{cite web|last=Wolfson|first=Sam|title=Samantha Cameron loves rapper Azealia Banks: has she heard the lyrics?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2012/sep/18/samantha-cameron-loves-azealia-banks|work=The Guardian|date=September 18, 2012|access-date=November 6, 2012}}</ref><ref name="guardianmarch">{{cite web|last=Empire|first=Kitty|title=Azealia Banks; Sharon Van Etten – review – The Observer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/04/azealia-banks-sharon-van-etten|work=The Guardian|date=March 3, 2012|access-date=November 6, 2012}}</ref> examples including her debut single "[[212 (song)|212]]", in which she uses the word more than ten times, or other songs such as [[Fantasea (mixtape)|"Fierce"]], in which she refers to herself as the "cunt queen".<ref>{{cite web|last=Banks|first=Azealia|title=Azealia Banks – 212 – Lyrics|url=http://azealiabanks.tumblr.com/post/11497782646/azealia-banks-212-lyrics|publisher=[[Tumblr]]|access-date=June 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Banks|first=Azealia|title=Fierce – Lyrics|url=http://azealiabanks.tumblr.com/post/28504276967/fierce-lyrics|publisher=[[Tumblr]]|access-date=June 27, 2013}}</ref> Banks attributes this to her upbringing in Harlem, saying, "...I'm from Harlem. I went to art school; I grew up with the cunts. And that term doesn't come from me! People think I invented it, but I didn't. To be cunty is to be feminine and to be, like, aware of yourself. Nobody's fucking with that inner strength and delicateness. The cunts, the gay men, adore that. My friends would say, 'Oh you need to cunt it up! You're being too [[banjee]].' Banjee means unrefined and rough. You need your cunts: they fix your hair for you and do your makeup. They give you confidence and give you life."<ref name="rollingstone" /> She is also known for her often fast-paced rapping, or "[[Flow (rapping)|flow]]".<ref name=guardianmarch /> In a review of Banks' debut [[extended play|EP]] [[1991 (EP)|''1991'']], Chris Dart of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' found Banks' rapping speed "remarkable", commenting that she "manages a feat that takes most rappers the better part of a career to master: the perfect marriage of bangin', club-friendly beats and smart, crisply delivered lyrics".<ref name="Dart">{{cite journal|last=Dart|first=Chris|date=June 13, 2012|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/HipHop/azealia_banks-1991|title=Azealia Banks – 1991|journal=[[Exclaim!]]|access-date=June 25, 2013}}</ref>

Since writing "212", Banks has adopted an alter ego named "Yung Rapunxel". This alter ego was adapted from Banks referring to herself as [[Rapunzel]], due to a long [[Artificial hair integrations|weave]] she wore while working at [[Starbucks]] as a teenager. Banks discussed this with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' saying, "Yung Rapunxel is that girl who pisses people off but doesn't really mean to. She's actually a sweetheart! But people are so taken aback that she's so herself; she's not even trying to be unique or different. She literally just lives in her head; she does what she wants to do.

On September 22, 2015, Banks became involved in a confrontation with a fellow passenger and the flight crew while attempting to exit a [[Delta Air Lines]] flight that had just landed in [[Los Angeles]]. According to witnesses, Banks was attempting to squeeze past other passengers to disembark the plane more quickly, when a French man blocked her path. Banks reacted by spitting in the man's face, punching him, and clawing at his shirt. Subsequently, a flight attendant stepped in and demanded that Banks calm down. This resulted in Banks forcefully arguing with the flight attendant, in which she at one point called the Delta employee a "fucking [[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/azealia-banks-drops-homophobic-slur-airplane-meltdown-article-1.2369767 |title=Azealia Banks' airline meltdown, homophobic slur caught on camera |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=September 22, 2015 |access-date=September 23, 2015 }}</ref> On November 10, 2015, it was reported Banks was under investigation by the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] following an altercation involving the rapper and a security guard at L.A. club Break Room 86.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6760579/azealia-banks-criminal-battery-investigation-security-guard-lapd |title=Azealia Banks Under Investigation for Alleged Scuffle With Security Guard |work=Billboard |access-date=November 10, 2015}}</ref> Later that year, Banks was arrested in New York after attacking a female security guard.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/6812937/azealia-banks-arrested-attacking-security-guard-report |title=Azealia Banks Arrested After Attacking Security Guard: Report |work=Billboard |access-date=December 17, 2015}}</ref>

In March 2016, [[Sarah Palin]] threatened a lawsuit against Banks in response to a series of tweets where she attacked the politician, calling for "the biggest burliest blackest negroes" to "run a train on her", and for someone to "film it and put it on [[WorldStarHipHop|worldstar]]."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/sarah-palin-threatens-to-sue-azealia-banks-over-twitter-tirade-20160405|title=Sarah Palin Threatens to Sue Azealia Banks Over Twitter Tirade|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=April 8, 2016}}</ref> Banks later apologized and said that her outburst was a result of her mistaking a fictional interview with Palin as a real event.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/06/azealia-banks-apologises-to-sarah-palin-twitter|title='I never said you should be raped': Azealia Banks apologises to Sarah Palin|date=April 6, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=April 8, 2016}}</ref> In the fictional interview, Palin is quoted as saying "Negroes loved being slaves."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://politicops.com/palin-even-the-french-understand-that-slavery-wasnt-our-fault-because-the-negroes-liked-it/ |title=Palin: "Even The French Understand That Slavery Wasn't Our Fault, Because The Negroes Liked It" |work=Politicops |access-date=April 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420033959/http://politicops.com/palin-even-the-french-understand-that-slavery-wasnt-our-fault-because-the-negroes-liked-it/ |archive-date=April 20, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In May 2016, Banks was dropped by her UK booking agency and removed from headlining the grime and hip-hop festival Born & Bred following racist and homophobic tweets to [[Zayn Malik]]. Her Twitter account was also blocked after a succession of tweets directed at Malik.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44302767 |title=Eight times celebrities messed up on social media|first=Lucy|last=Todd|date=May 30, 2018|access-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref>

In December 2016, Banks posted a series of videos on [[Instagram]] detailing her cleanup of a closet in her apartment where she claims to have been practicing [[witchcraft]]. She admitted to practicing "three years worth of [[Witchcraft in Latin America|brujeria]]”. The video appears to show dried blood, feathers, and the [[carrion]] of dead chickens.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://people.com/music/azealia-banks-witchcraft-brujeria-peta-statement/|title=Azealia Banks Cleans Blood-Stained Room She's Used to Practice Witchcraft for 3 Years: 'Real Witches Do Real Things'|publisher=People|author=Dave Quinn|date= December 30, 2016  |access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> She was criticized on Twitter by the artist [[Sia (musician)|Sia]], who stated that "sacrificing animals for your gain is the wackest shit I've ever heard.

In January 2019, Banks made a wordplay of the Irish airline [[Aer Lingus]], calling it "Air Cunnilingus", and had to leave the plane due to an altercation with an air stewardess in January 2019, after calling her "fucking ugly" on Instagram. Banks also labelled Irish people "inbred" and referred to them as "[[leprechaun]]s," adding "most of you can't talk or write." She also mocked the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] on Instagram by asking a follower; "don't you have a famine to go die in?" The following day, she said she would dedicate her Dublin show to "beautiful Irish women."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/azealia-banks-i-want-to-dedicate-this-to-all-the-beautiful-irish-women-1.3767685|title=Azealia Banks: 'I want to dedicate this to all the beautiful Irish women'|first=Aoife|last=Moriarty|website=The Irish Times}}</ref>
