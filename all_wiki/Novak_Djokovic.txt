He is ranked [[List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players|world No. 1]] by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP), has held the top ranking for 296 weeks, and has finished as the year-end No. 1 six times, an Open Era record shared with [[Pete Sampras]]. Djokovic has won 17 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] men's singles titles, the third-most in history behind only [[Roger Federer]] and [[Rafael Nadal]]. He is the only player to win all of the elite tournaments on the modern ATP Tour – that is, all four Grand Slam tournaments, all nine [[ATP Masters 1000]] tournaments, and the [[ATP Finals]]. In particular, he is also the only player to complete the [[Tennis Masters Series records and statistics#Career Golden Masters|career Golden Masters]], which he has done twice. Overall, he has won 81 ATP singles titles, including a record eight [[Australian Open]] titles and a record 36 Masters events.

Djokovic began his professional career around the time Federer and Nadal established themselves as the two dominant players in men's tennis. At age 20, he interrupted their streak of 11 consecutive majors to win his first Grand Slam singles title at the [[2008 Australian Open]]. By 2010, Djokovic and [[Andy Murray]] also separated themselves from the rest of men's tennis to join Federer and Nadal in the [[Big Four (tennis)|Big Four]], the group of players who have dominated men's tennis through the end of the next decade.{{efn|The group of Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic has also been called the Big Three in reference to their place as three of the greatest male tennis players of all-time.}} In 2011, Djokovic surpassed the rest of the Big Four with his first ''[[annus mirabilis]]'', during which he became No. 1 for the first time as he won three out of four majors and his first five Masters events of the year. He remained the best player in men's tennis for the rest of the decade, leading the tour in major and Masters titles, and winning four out of his five titles at the ATP Finals consecutively from 2012 through 2015. After four consecutive year-end finishes at No. 3 through 2010, Djokovic finished No. 1 six times and No. 2 three times in the next ten years.

Djokovic had another career year in 2015, reaching fifteen consecutive finals, including all four major finals and eight Masters finals, winning three majors and six Masters events as well as the ATP Finals. The following year, he won the [[2016 French Open]] to complete the [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Grand Slam|career Grand Slam]]. He also became the first male player since [[Rod Laver]] in 1969 to hold all four major titles at once and the only male player in history to do so on three different surfaces. After long trailing both [[Djokovic–Federer rivalry|Federer]] and [[Djokovic–Nadal rivalry|Nadal]] in their head-to-head records, Djokovic has since taken the lead against all of the other Big Four members. Representing Serbia, Djokovic has led the [[Serbia Davis Cup team]] to their first title in [[2010 Davis Cup|2010]], and also led Serbia to a title at the inaugural [[2020 ATP Cup|ATP Cup]] in 2020. He won a bronze medal in singles at the [[Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]].

Two of the main strengths of Djokovic's playing style are his powerful and consistent two-handed backhand and his ability to turn defense into offense. He excels at returning serve in particular, and regularly ranks among the tour leaders in return points, return games, and break points won. He has also led the ATP Tour in their career Under Pressure Rating statistic since 1991, in part because of his prowess at winning deciding sets. Djokovic has won the [[Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year|Laureus World Sportsman of the Year]] award four times. He is also a recipient of the [[Order of St. Sava]], the [[Order of Karađorđe's Star]], and the [[Order of the Republika Srpska]].

==Early and family life==
Novak Djokovic (Nole) was born in [[Belgrade]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]], to parents Srđan and Dijana Đoković.

Genčić worked with young Djokovic over the following six years before realizing that, due to his rapid development, going abroad in search of increased level of competition was the best option for his future. To that end, she contacted [[Nikola Pilić]] and in September 1999 the 12-year-old moved to the Pilić tennis academy in [[Oberschleißheim]], Germany, spending four years there.<ref>{{cite news | last=Clarey | first=Christopher | title=Djokovic Is on the Rise, Just as He Expects to Be | work=The New York Times | date=26 May 2007 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/sports/tennis/26tennis.html | access-date=28 July 2019}}</ref> At the age of 14, he began his international career, winning European championships in singles, doubles, and team competition.<ref name="djokovic.com"/>

I am Serbian, I am proud of being a Serbian, I didn't want to spoil that just because another country had better conditions.

In the 2011 Wimbledon final, Djokovic won in four sets, which was his first victory over Nadal in a Major.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/sports/tennis/2011-wimbledon-mens-final-novak-djokovic-defeats-rafael-nadal.html |title=Djokovic Overwhelms Nadal for Wimbledon Title|accessdate=3 July 2011 | work=The New York Times|first=Christopher|last=Clarey|date=3 July 2011}}</ref> By doing so, he became the only person other than Federer to defeat Nadal in a Grand Slam tournament final. Djokovic also defeated Nadal in the 2011 US Open Final to capture his third major title of the year and fourth overall. By beating Nadal, Djokovic became the second player to defeat Nadal in more than one Grand Slam final (the other being Federer), and the first player to beat Nadal in a Slam final on a surface other than grass. In 2012, Djokovic defeated Nadal in the Australian Open final which made Nadal the first male player to lose in three consecutive Grand Slam finals.

At the [[2012 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters]] in April, Nadal finally beat Djokovic for the first time since November 2010. They had met in seven finals from January 2011 to January 2012, all of which Djokovic won. Nadal again defeated Djokovic in the final of the Rome Masters tournament.

At the [[2012 French Open]], Djokovic faced Nadal in the final. For the second time in tennis history, two tennis players played four consecutive Grand Slams finals against each other. They also became the only players in history, except for Venus and Serena Williams, to have faced the same opponent in the finals of each of the four different Grand Slam events. Nadal eventually won in four sets after multiple rain delays that forced the final to be concluded on the following Monday afternoon.

In 2013, Djokovic defeated Nadal in straight sets in the final of the Monte-Carlo Masters to clinch his first title in Monte Carlo. This was his third clay win against Nadal. At the 2013 French Open semifinal, Nadal defeated Djokovic to up his record to 20–15 against Djokovic, and again at the 2013 Rogers Cup semifinal. On 9 September 2013, Djokovic lost to Nadal in the [[2013 US Open (tennis)|2013 US Open]] final in four sets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/504849/20130910/novak-djokovic-u-s-open-rafael-nadal.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131104103446/http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/504849/20130910/novak-djokovic-u-s-open-rafael-nadal.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 November 2013|title=Novak Djokovic Loses to Rafael Nadal at the 2013 U.S. Open Men's Finals, Talks Marriage with Girlfriend Jelena Ristic|date=10 September 2013|work=International Business Times|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref> In 2014, Djokovic defeated Nadal in 3 sets at the Rome Masters 1000 tournament to claim his 3rd title there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/tennis/story/_/id/10950007/novak-djokovic-tops-rafael-nadal-italian-open-title|title=Novak Djokovic tops Rafael Nadal Italian Open title|date=18 May 2014|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> At the [[2014 French Open]], they played in the final, with Djokovic again attempting to capture the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Career Grand Slam]].

At the 2015 French Open, Djokovic finally defeated nine-time champion and five-time consecutive defending champion at the French Open, thus ending Nadal's 39-match win streak at this tournament. He became only the second man in history to have defeated Nadal at the tournament (after [[Robin Söderling]] in 2009), and the first to do so in straight sets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/03/uk-tennis-open-idUKKBN0OJ27620150603|title=Djokovic ends Nadal's remarkable reign in brutal fashion|work=Reuters|date=4 June 2015|accessdate=6 June 2015|author=Pritha Sarkar}}</ref>

At the [[2018 Wimbledon Championships]], the two faced each other in the semifinals. This match became their second-longest match and just their third five-set meeting, stretching for 5 hours and 17 minutes over two days. Djokovic broke Nadal in the final game of the fifth set to win 10–8, after saving three break points at 7–7 which would have allowed Nadal to serve for the match. This was Nadal's first defeat in the semifinals of a Grand Slam since the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]], and his first ever defeat in the semifinals of Wimbledon.

In the 2016 clay court season, Djokovic and Murray met in the final of the [[2016 Mutua Madrid Open]], where Djokovic captured his record-breaking 29th Masters 1000 title in three sets.

At the apex of the clay court season, the [[2016 French Open]], Djokovic and Murray met once again at the final. Despite losing the first set 3–6, Djokovic went on to win the next three sets 6–1, 6–2, 6–4 and claim his maiden [[French Open]] title.

He's perhaps the best put-together player that I've seen over 60 years.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/bollettieri-calls-djokovic-the-games-most-complete-player-ever/ | first= David |last=Cox|title=Bollettieri Calls Djokovic the Game's Most Complete Player, Ever|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=8 August 2015}}</ref>}}

Tennis pundits have classified many of Djokovic's matches as some of the greatest contests ever, with the [[2012 Australian Open – Men's Singles final|2012 Australian Open final]] being considered one of the greatest matches ever seen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/16781690|title= Novak Djokovic v Rafael Nadal: Players & pundits hail 'greatest' match|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 January 2012|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Greatest Tennis Matches of All Time|author=Steve Flink|publisher=New Chapter Press|isbn=978-0-942257-93-9|year=2012|page=452}}</ref> Some longtime analysts claim that the [[Djokovic–Nadal rivalry]] ranks as the best rivalry in tennis history primarily because of the quality of matches they produce.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.b92.net/sport/teme/ozmo.php?yyyy=2014&mm=01&nav_id=797319|title=Rivalstva XXI veka: Da li je Rafole već srušio Fedala?|date=8 January 2014|publisher=B92 – Saša Ozmo|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref>

==Playing style and equipment==
Djokovic is an [[Tennis strategy#Offensive baseliner|aggressive baseline player]].<ref name="tennisworld1">{{cite web|title=Djole's Frames of Mind|url=http://tennisworld.typepad.com/thewrap/2009/03/noles-frames-of.html|accessdate=3 March 2009}}</ref> His groundstrokes from both wings are consistent, deep, and penetrating. His backhand is widely regarded as one of the best in today's game, due to its effectiveness on both sides of the court. His best shot is his backhand down the line, with great pace and precision. He is also known as one of the greatest movers on the court with high agility, court coverage and defensive ability, which allows him to hit winners from seemingly defensive positions. After great technical difficulties during the 2009 season (coinciding with his switch to the Head racket series), his [[serve (tennis)|serve]] is one of his major weapons again, winning him many free points; his first serve is typically hit flat, while he prefers to slice and kick his second serves wide.<ref name="tennisworld1"/>
[[File:2018 Monte-Carlo Masters IMGL0410 (42396211971).jpg|thumb|left|Djokovic serving at the [[Monte-Carlo Masters]] in 2018]]
Djokovic's return of serve is a powerful weapon for him, with which he can be both offensive and defensive. Djokovic is rarely aced because of his flexibility, length and balance. Djokovic is highly efficient off both the forehand and backhand return, often getting the return in play deep with pace, neutralizing the advantage the server usually has in a point. [[John McEnroe]] considers Djokovic to be the greatest returner of serve in the history of the men's game. Occasionally, Djokovic employs a well-disguised backhand underspin [[drop shot]] and sliced backhand. His smash is considered to be one of his biggest weaknesses, being prone to making mistakes on the shot in big moments such as the 2008 Olympics.

Djokovic commented on the modern style of play, including his own, in interview with [[Jim Courier]] after his semi-final win against [[Andy Murray]] in the [[2012 Australian Open]] tournament:<ref>Djokovic as interviewed by [[Jim Courier]] on the court after his semi-final win against [[Andy Murray]] in the [[2012 Australian Open]], [[Eurosport]] broadcast, 27/28 January 2012.</ref>

Entering the pro circuit, Djokovic used the [[Head (company)|Head]] Liquidmetal Radical, but changed sponsors to [[Wilson Sporting Goods|Wilson]] in 2005. He couldn't find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson agreed to make him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protennisfan.com/2005/12/djokovic_signs_.html|title=Djokovic Signs With Wilson|publisher=Pro Tennis Fan|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed Pro at the 2009 [[Australian Open]]. He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://novakdjokovic.com/en/album/head-graphene-speed-racquet-promo/f/head_novak_speed_launch_03/#|title=HEAD Graphene™ Speed Racquet Promo|publisher=NovakDjokovic.com|accessdate=22 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220182728/http://novakdjokovic.com/en/album/head-graphene-speed-racquet-promo/f/head_novak_speed_launch_03/|archivedate=20 December 2014}}</ref> Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses.

In assessing Djokovic's 2011 season, [[Jimmy Connors]] said that Djokovic gives his opponents problems by playing "a little bit old-school, taking the ball earlier, catching the ball on the rise, (and) driving the ball flat." Connors adds that a lot of the topspin that Djokovic's opponents drive at him comes right into his zone, thus his ability to turn defense into offense well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/tennis/blog/_/name/espntennis/id/7026363/greats-awed-novak-djokovic|title=Past greats awed by Novak Djokovic|date=27 September 2011|author=Sandra Harwitt|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref>

===Coaching and personal team===
In the period 2004 and 2005, Djokovic was coached by [[Dejan Petrovic]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tkpuma.com/en/coaches|title=TKK Puma Coaches, Dejan Petrović|work=TKK Puma|date=6 January 2015|accessdate=6 January 2015|location=Kragujevac|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106161734/http://www.tkpuma.com/en/coaches|archivedate=6 January 2015}}</ref> From fall 2005 until June 2006, he was coached by [[Riccardo Piatti]], who divided his time between the 18-year-old and [[Ivan Ljubičić]]. Player and coach reportedly parted ways over the latter's refusal to work full-time with Djokovic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article1083263.ece|title=Djokovic unable to take the strain in battle with Nadal|last=Harman|first=Neil|work=The Times|date=8 June 2006|accessdate=9 July 2011|location=London, UK}}</ref>

From June 2006 until May 2017, Djokovic was coached by Slovakian former professional tennis player [[Marián Vajda]]. They met for the first time during that year's French Open, after which Vajda was hired to be the 19-year-old's coach. On occasion Djokovic employed additional coaches on part-time basis: in 2007, during the spring hardcourt season, he worked with Australian doubles ace [[Mark Woodforde]] with specific emphasis on volleys and net play while from August 2009 until April 2010 American [[Todd Martin]] joined the coaching team, a period marked by his ill-fated attempt to change Djokovic's serve motion.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/sports/tennis/blog/_/name/tennis/id/5082385 Martin-Djokovic doomed from the outset], tennis.com blog, April 2010.</ref>
From early 2007 until 2017, Djokovic worked with physiotherapist Miljan Amanović, who was previously employed by [[KK Crvena zvezda|Red Star Belgrade]], and NBA player [[Vladimir Radmanović]].<ref>[http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/sport/story/105050/Amanovi%C4%87%3ANole+se+kupa+u+ledu+posle+me%C4%8Da.html Amanović:Nole se kupa u ledu posle meča];''Press'', 11 March 2010</ref>

From the fall 2006, Djokovic had an Israeli fitness coach, Ronen Bega, but the two parted ways during spring 2009.<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4093777,00.html Novak Djokovic's Israeli connection];YNetNews.com, 12 July 2011.</ref> Djokovic decided to make a change after identifying his conditioning as a weakness in his game following continual losses to Nadal.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ix4ts1zuZw Djokovic @ Svedok], RTS via YouTube.com, 4 May 2009.</ref> In April 2009, ahead of the [[2009 Internazionali BNL d'Italia – Men's Singles|Rome Masters]], Djokovic hired Austrian Gebhard Phil-Gritsch (formerly worked with [[Thomas Muster]]) to join the team in fitness coach capacity.<ref>[http://tennisconnected.com/home/tag/gebhard-phil-gritsch/ Nole Hires Muster Fitness Coach];TennisConnected, 26 April 2009</ref><ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/novak-djokovic-the-man-who-met-his-match-with-murray-1809033.html Novak Djokovic: The man who met his match with Murray], ''The Independent'', 25 October 2009.</ref>

After retiring from professional tennis in August 2011, Serbian player [[Dušan Vemić]] joined Djokovic's team as assistant coach and hitting partner for Novak. The collaboration ended before the [[2013 US Open – Men's Singles|2013 US Open]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraf.rs/sport/809696-djokovic-vise-ne-radi-sa-vemicem|title=Đoković više ne radi s Vemićem!|date=22 August 2011|work=telegraf.rs|accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref>

Six-time major champion and former world No. 1 [[Boris Becker]], who had mostly worked as television pundit for [[BBC Sport]] and [[Sky Sports]] since retiring from playing in 1999, was announced as Djokovic's new head coach in December 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://novakdjokovic.com/en/news/tennis/boris-becker-new-head-coach-of-novak-djokovic/ |title=Boris Becker new Head Coach of Novak Djokovic! |work=Novak Djokovic Official Website}}</ref> According to Djokovic, the Becker appointment was done with input from the player's existing head coach Marián Vajda who reportedly wanted to spend more time with his family and was looking to have his coaching workload somewhat reduced.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/australian-open-2014-novak-djokovic-admits-boris-becker-linkup-is-a-risk-9054332.html |title=Novak Djokovic admits Boris Becker link-up is a 'risk' |work=[[The Independent]] |date=12 January 2014 |first=Eleanor |last=Crooks |accessdate=16 August 2015 |location=London}}</ref> For Becker, in addition to working alongside Vajda, the job entailed special emphasis on Grand Slam tournaments as Djokovic felt he missed out on winning a couple of majors over the previous two seasons due to a lack of mental edge in the final stages of those tournaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/tennis/novak-djokovic-hopes-having-boris-becker-on-board-results-in-more-grand-slam-titles|title=Novak Djokovic hopes having Boris Becker on board results in more grand slam titles|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|date=23 February 2014|first=Ahmed|last=Rizvi|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> Becker's first tournament coaching Djokovic was the [[2014 Australian Open – Men's Singles|2014 Australian Open]].

On 5 May 2017, Djokovic confirmed that he had come to a mutual agreement to terminate his coaching relationship with Vajda, as well as Phil-Gritsch and Amanović. In a statement on his website, Djokovic cited the reasons for the personnel shakeup: "Novak and the team members decided to part ways after a detailed analysis of the game, achieved results in the previous period, and also after discussing private plans of each team member. Despite the fantastic cooperation so far, Djokovic felt he needed to make a change, and to introduce new energy in order to raise his level of play."<ref>{{cite web|title=I want to find the winning spark on the court again|url=http://novakdjokovic.com/en/news/media/i-want-to-find-the-winning-spark-on-the-court-again/|publisher=PRpepper production|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref>

====Investments====
In 2005, as Djokovic moved up the tennis rankings, he began venturing into the business world. Most of his activities in the business arena have been channeled through Family Sport, a legal entity in Serbia established and run by members of his immediate family. Registered as a [[limited liability company]], Family Sport initially focused on [[hospitality industry|hospitality]], specifically the restaurant business, by launching Novak Café & Restaurant, a franchise themed around Djokovic's tennis success. Over time, the company, whose day-to-day operations are mostly handled by Novak's father Srdjan and uncle Goran, expanded its activities into real estate, sports/entertainment event organization, and sports apparel distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://family-sport.com/en/about.html|title=Family Sport|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029183819/http://family-sport.com/en/about.html|archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Serbia Open double.jpg|thumb|The [[Serbia Open]], an [[ATP Tour 250|ATP 250]] tournament, was organised by the ''Family Sport'' from 2009–2012]]

The company launched Novak Café & Restaurant in 2008 in the Belgrade municipality of [[Novi Beograd]], the flagship location in a [[franchising|franchised]] chain of theme café-restaurants. During 2009, two more locations were added—one in [[Kragujevac]] and the other in Belgrade, the city's second, in September at the neighbourhood of [[Dorćol]] overlooking the playing courts of [[Serbia Open]] whose inaugural edition took place several months earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://novakdjokovic.com/vesti/dogadjaji/svecano-otvoren-novak-cafe-restaurant-na-dorcolu/ |title=Svečano otvoren NOVAK CAFE & RESTAURANT na Dorćolu! |publisher=Djokovic press release |date=21 September 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref> On 16 December 2011 a location in [[Novi Sad]] was opened,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://novakdjokovic.com/en/news/events/novak-cafe-restaurant-opened-in-novi-sad/ |title=Novak Café & Restaurant opened in Novi Sad |publisher=Djokovic press release |date=18 December 2011 |accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref> however, it operated just over three years before closing in late March 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blic.rs/zabava/vesti/djokovici-zatvorili-restoran-u-novom-sadu/ps263sq |title=Đokovići zatvorili restoran u Novom Sadu |publisher=blic.rs|language=Serbian |date=28 March 2015 |accessdate=15 November 2020}}</ref> [[Banja Luka]] in neighbouring [[Republika Srpska]] got its Novak Café & Restaurant location on 16 October 2015 within Hotel Trešnja on Banj hill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pressrs.ba/info/banjaluka/banjaluka-dobila-novak-cafe-na-banj-brdu-16-10-2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809091416/http://pressrs.ba/info/banjaluka/banjaluka-dobila-novak-cafe-na-banj-brdu-16-10-2015|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 August 2016|title=Banjaluka dobila Novak Café na Banj brdu|author=Mirjana Despot|publisher=PressRS.ba|date=16 October 2015|accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/biznis/u-banjoj-luci-otvoren-restoran-novaka-djokovica/151017075#9 |title=U Banjoj Luci otvoren restoran Novaka Đokovića |author=T.

In 2009, the company bought a [[ATP Tour 250|250-series]] ATP tournament known as the [[Dutch Open (tennis)|Dutch Open]] and moved it to Serbia where it was renamed the [[Serbia Open]].

===Professional Tennis Players Association===
In August 2020, Djokovic resigned from the Players Council of the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] and formed the [[Professional Tennis Players Association]] (PTPA) with [[Vasek Pospisil]]. The pair will serve as co-presidents of the new organisation to promote the interests of male tennis players above a ranking of 500 in singles and 200 in doubles. Like the ATP, women players are not currently included in the PTPA.<ref name=NYTAug20>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/sports/tennis/tennis-union-men-djokovic.amp.html|title=Djokovic and Other Top Men Are Creating a Players' Association|date=28 August 2020|author=Ben Rothenberg|work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 August 2020}}</ref>
