On 15 June 2017, the [[United States Senate]] voted 98 to 2 for the bill (an amendment to the underlying Iran sanctions bill), which was rooted in a bill introduced in January that year by a bipartisan group of senators over Russia's continued involvement in the wars in Ukraine and Syria and its [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 election]]; with regard to Russia, the bill was designed to expand the punitive measures previously imposed by executive orders and convert them into law.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/senate-overwhelmingly-passes-new-russia-and-iran-sanctions/2017/06/15/df9afc2a-51d8-11e7-91eb-9611861a988f_story.html |title=Senate overwhelmingly passes new Russia and Iran sanctions |first=Karoun |last=Demirjian |date=15 June 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=August 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121090530/https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/senate-overwhelmingly-passes-new-russia-and-iran-sanctions/2017/06/15/df9afc2a-51d8-11e7-91eb-9611861a988f_story.html |archive-date=January 21, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/13/senate-gop-dems-agree-on-new-sanctions-on-russia.html |title=Senate GOP, Dems agree on new sanctions on Russia |date=13 June 2017 |website=[[Fox News]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=August 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718000443/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/13/senate-gop-dems-agree-on-new-sanctions-on-russia.html |archive-date=July 18, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The bill in the Senate incorporated the provisions of the ''Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act'' that was introduced in May 2017 by Senator [[Benjamin Cardin|Ben Cardin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s1221 |title=S. 1221 (115th): Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 |website=GovTrack.us |accessdate=October 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921153417/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s1221 |archive-date=September 21, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1221 |title=S.1221 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 |first=Cardin |last=Benjamin |date=June 6, 2017 |website=U.S. Congress |accessdate=October 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926010154/https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1221 |archive-date=September 26, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===President of the United States===
On the day President Trump signed the bill into law, he issued two separate, simultaneous [[signing statements]].<ref name="2statem">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/08/02/trump-russia-sanctions-signing-statement-raises-constitutional-issues/534099001/ |title=Facing veto override on Russia sanctions, Trump's signing statement raises constitutional issues |first=Gregory |last=Korte |date=August 2, 2017 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |access-date=August 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213211302/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/08/02/trump-russia-sanctions-signing-statement-raises-constitutional-issues/534099001/ |archive-date=December 13, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Bluebook journal |title=Recent Signing Statement: President Trump Objects to Act Imposing Sanctions on Russia and Congressional Review of Presidential Waivers |first= |last=Note |volume=131 |journal=[[Harvard Law Review|Harv.

"While I favor tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior by Iran, North Korea, and Russia, this legislation is significantly flawed. In its haste to pass this legislation, the Congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions" — such as restrictions on [[executive branch]]′s authority that limited its flexibility in foreign policy.<ref name="NYTstatem"/><ref name="presstatement">{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/02/statement-president-donald-j-trump-signing-hr-3364 |title=Statement by President Donald J.

Kerry]]'' ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. The president appeared to indicate that he might choose not to enforce certain provisions of the legislation:<ref name="NYTstatem" /> "My Administration will give careful and respectful consideration to the preferences expressed by the Congress in these various provisions and will implement them in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations."<ref name="presstatement" /> It also said: "Finally, my Administration particularly expects the Congress to refrain from using this flawed bill to hinder our important work with European allies to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, and from using it to hinder our efforts to address any unintended consequences it may have for American businesses, our friends, or our allies."<ref name="presstatement" />

The other statement by  Trump noted: "[T]he bill remains seriously flawed – particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch's authority to negotiate. Congress could not even negotiate a healthcare bill after seven years of talking. By limiting the Executive's flexibility, this bill makes it harder for the United States to strike good deals for the American people, and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together.<ref name="presstatement2">{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/02/statement-president-donald-j-trump-signing-countering-americas |title=Statement by President Donald J.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman [[Heather Nauert]] stated: "Since the enactment of the CAATSA legislation, we estimate that foreign governments have abandoned planned or announced purchases of several billion dollars in Russian defense acquisitions.

In June 2020, USA's [[Senate Majority Whip]], [[John Thune]], [[US Republican Party|R]]-[[South Dakota|S.D.]], proposed an amendment to the 2021 [[National Defense Authorization Act]] to allow the [[US Department of Defense]] to purchase [[Turkey]]’s [[Russia]]n-made [[S-400 missile system]], using the [[U.S. Army]]’s missile procurement account. The reasoning is that this would remove the issue of Turkey having a foreign military system that contravenes the CAATSA.

==Criticism==
The senior fellow at Singapore's [[ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute]] wrote that "Washington's efforts to curb Moscow's global arms sales may have the unintended effect of obstructing some Southeast Asian countries' attempts to resist Beijing's relentless advances; they may even enhance China's influence."<ref name="ISEAS"/>

According to the [[Stratfor]], "the CAATSA process could discourage [[Vietnam]] from further building its defense relationship with the United States, if only to avoid future compromises to its strategic autonomy. ... In today's world, middle powers are increasingly assertive and refuse to tie themselves to any single great power. The United States' reliance on the blunt tool of extraterritoriality could eventually backfire if it's not careful."<ref>{{cite news |title=With CAATSA, the U.S. is Trying to Make Russia Hurt |url=https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/caatsa-us-trying-make-russia-hurt |work=[[Stratfor]] |date=May 28, 2018 |access-date=June 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630172010/https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/caatsa-us-trying-make-russia-hurt |archive-date=June 30, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
