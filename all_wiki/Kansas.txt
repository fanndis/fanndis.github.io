Kansas was first settled by [[Americans]] in 1827 with the establishment of [[Fort Leavenworth]]. The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] debate. When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], abolitionist [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] from [[New England]] and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a [[Slave states and free states|free state or a slave state]]. Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as [[Bleeding Kansas]].

==History==

{{Main|History of Kansas}}
[[File:War dance in the interiour of a Konza lodge.jpg|thumb|Samuel Seymour's 1819 illustration of a [[Kaw people|Kansa]] lodge and dance is the oldest drawing known to have been done in Kansas.]]

Before [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]], Kansas was occupied by the [[Caddoan]] [[Wichita people|Wichita]] and later the [[Siouan]] [[Kaw people]]. The first European to set foot in present-day Kansas was the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]], who explored the area in 1541. 

Between 1763 and 1803 the territory of Kansas was integrated into [[Spanish Louisiana]]. The governor [[Luis de Unzaga]] 'le Conciliateur', during that period, promoted expeditions and good relations with the [[Amerindians]] peoples, among the explorers were [[Antoine de Marigny]] and others who continued trading across the [[Kansas River]], especially at its confluence with the [[Missouri River]], tributaries of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>Cazorla, Frank, G. Baena, Rosa, Polo, David, Reder Gadow, Marion (2019) Luis de Unzaga (1717-1793) Pioneer in the birth of the United States and in the liberalism. Foundation Malaga</ref>

In 1803, most of modern Kansas was [[United States territorial acquisitions|acquired by the United States]] as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Southwest Kansas, however, was still a part of Spain, Mexico, and the [[Republic of Texas]] until the conclusion of the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1848, when these lands were [[Mexican Cession|ceded to the United States]]. From 1812 to 1821, Kansas was part of the [[Missouri Territory]]. The [[Santa Fe Trail]] traversed Kansas from 1821 to 1880, transporting manufactured goods from [[Missouri]] and silver and furs from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. Wagon ruts from the trail are still visible in the prairie today.

In 1827, [[Fort Leavenworth]] became the first permanent settlement of white Americans in the future state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a211662.pdf|title=A Brief History of Fort Leavenworth|author=Partin, John W. Partin|year=1983|access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref> The [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] became law on May 30, 1854, establishing [[Nebraska Territory]] and [[Kansas Territory]], and opening the area to broader settlement by whites. [[Kansas Territory]] stretched all the way to the Continental Divide and included the sites of present-day [[Denver]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]].
[[File:Battle of Lawrence.png|thumb|[[Lawrence Massacre|Quantrill's Raid]] on [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]]]

Missouri and [[Arkansas]] sent settlers into Kansas all along its eastern border. These settlers attempted to sway votes in favor of slavery. The secondary settlement of Americans in Kansas Territory were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] from [[Massachusetts]] and other [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]], who attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring Missouri. Directly presaging the [[American Civil War]], these forces collided, entering into skirmishes that earned the territory the name of [[Bleeding Kansas]].

Kansas was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as a free state on January 29, 1861, making it the 34th state to join the United States. By that time, the violence in Kansas had largely subsided, but during the Civil War, on August 21, 1863, [[William Quantrill]] led several hundred men on a raid into [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], destroying much of the city and killing nearly 200 people. He was roundly condemned by both the conventional [[Confederate States Army|Confederate military]] and the partisan rangers commissioned by the [[Missouri legislature]]. His application to that body for a commission was flatly rejected due to his pre-war criminal record.<ref>Jones, ''Gray Ghosts and Rebel Riders'' Holt & Co. 1956, p. 76</ref>

After the Civil War, many veterans constructed homesteads in Kansas. Many [[African Americans]] also looked to Kansas as the land of "[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]" and, led by [[freedmen]] like [[Benjamin "Pap" Singleton]], began establishing black colonies in the state. Leaving southern states in the late 1870s because of increasing discrimination, they became known as [[Exodusters]].

At the same time, the [[Chisholm Trail]] was opened and the [[American Old West|Wild West]]-era commenced in Kansas. [[Wild Bill Hickok]] was a deputy marshal at [[Fort Riley]] and a marshal at [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]] and [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]]. [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] was another wild cowboy town, and both [[Bat Masterson]] and [[Wyatt Earp]] worked as lawmen in the town. In one year alone, eight million head of cattle from Texas boarded trains in Dodge City bound for the East, earning Dodge the nickname "Queen of the Cowtowns".

In response to demands of Methodists and other evangelical Protestants, in 1881 Kansas became the first U.S. state to adopt a constitutional amendment [[Prohibition|prohibiting]] all [[Alcohol laws of Kansas|alcoholic beverages]], which was repealed in 1948.

Kansas is bordered by [[Nebraska]] to the north; [[Missouri]] to the east; [[Oklahoma]] to the south; and [[Colorado]] to the west. The state is divided into [[List of counties in Kansas|105 counties]] with [[List of cities in Kansas|628 cities]], with its largest county by area being [[Butler County, Kansas|Butler County]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/rank/kansas-state--land-area--county-rank.htm|title=Kansas Land Area County Rank|website=www.usa.com}}</ref> Kansas is located [[equidistant]] from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The [[Geographic center of the contiguous United States|geographic center of the 48 contiguous states]] is in [[Smith County, Kansas|Smith County]] near [[Lebanon, Kansas|Lebanon]]. Until 1989, the [[Meades Ranch Triangulation Station]] in [[Osborne County, Kansas|Osborne County]] was the geodetic center of North America: the central reference point for all maps of North America. The geographic center of Kansas is in [[Barton County, Kansas|Barton County]].

===Geology===

{{Main|Geology of Kansas}}

Kansas is underlain by a sequence of horizontal to gently westward [[Strike and dip|dipping]] [[sedimentary rock]]s. A sequence of [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Permian]] rocks outcrop in the eastern and southern part of the state. The state's western half has exposures of [[Cretaceous]] through Tertiary sediments, the latter derived from the [[erosion]] of the [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] [[Rocky Mountains]] to the west. These are underlain by older Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments which correlate well with the outcrops to the east. The state's northeastern corner was subjected to [[glaciation]] in the [[Pleistocene]] and is covered by [[glacial drift]] and [[loess]].

===Topography===

The western two-thirds of the state, lying in the [[Great Plains|great central plain]] of the United States, has a generally flat or undulating surface, while the eastern third has many hills and forests. The land gradually rises from east to west; its altitude ranges from {{convert|684|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} along the [[Verdigris River]] at [[Coffeyville, Kansas|Coffeyville]] in [[Montgomery County, Kansas|Montgomery County]], to {{convert|4039|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} at [[Mount Sunflower]], {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} from the Colorado border, in [[Wallace County, Kansas|Wallace County]]. It is a common misconception that Kansas is the flattest state in the nation—in 2003, a tongue-in-cheek study famously declared the state "flatter than a pancake".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume9/v9i3/kansas.html |title = Kansas Is Flatter Than a Pancake |publisher = Improbable.com |accessdate = July 31, 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100730133707/http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume9/v9i3/kansas.html |archivedate = July 30, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> In fact, Kansas has a maximum topographic relief of {{convert|3360|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.infoplease.com/world/united-states-geography/highest-lowest-and-mean-elevations-united-states |title = Highest, Lowest, and Mean Elevations in the United States |publisher = infoplease.com | accessdate = May 20, 2018}}</ref> making it the 23rd flattest U.S. state measured by maximum relief.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.geotimes.org/oct03/NN_pancake.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040124015708/http://www.geotimes.org/oct03/NN_pancake.html |url-status = dead |archive-date = January 24, 2004 |title = Fracas over Kansas pancake flap |publisher = Geotimes.org |accessdate = July 31, 2010 }}</ref>

===Rivers===

[[File:Spring River 2006-07-03 2104.jpg|thumb|right|[[Spring River (Missouri)|Spring River]], Kansas]]

Nearly {{convert|75|mi|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} of the state's northeastern boundary is defined by the [[Missouri River]]. The [[Kansas River]] (locally known as the Kaw), formed by the junction of the [[Smoky Hill River|Smoky Hill]] and [[Republican River|Republican]] rivers at appropriately-named [[Junction City, Kansas|Junction City]], joins the Missouri River at [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], after a course of {{convert|170|mi|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} across the northeastern part of the state.

The [[Arkansas River]] ([[Arkansas River#Pronunciations|pronunciation varies]]), rising in [[Colorado]], flows with a bending course for nearly {{convert|500|mi|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} across the western and southern parts of the state. With its tributaries, (the [[Little Arkansas River|Little Arkansas]], [[Ninnescah River|Ninnescah]], Walnut, [[Cow Creek (Kansas)|Cow Creek]], [[Cimarron River (Arkansas River)|Cimarron]], Verdigris, and the [[Neosho River|Neosho]]), it forms the southern drainage system of the state.

Kansas's other rivers are the [[Saline River (Kansas)|Saline]] and Solomon Rivers, tributaries of the Smoky Hill River; the [[Big Blue River (Kansas)|Big Blue]], [[Delaware River (Kansas)|Delaware]], and [[Wakarusa River|Wakarusa]], which flow into the Kansas River; and the [[Marais des Cygnes River|Marais des Cygnes]], a tributary of the Missouri River. Spring River is located between [[Riverton, Kansas|Riverton]] and [[Baxter Springs, Kansas|Baxter Springs]].

===Climate===

[[File:Kansas Köppen.svg|thumb|Köppen climate types in Kansas]]
[[File:Kansas Windmills.JPG|thumb|Clouds in northeastern Kansas]]
[[File:Kansas Summer Wheat and Storm Panorama.jpg|thumb|Kansas Summer Wheat and Storm Panorama]]

According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Kansas's climate can be characterized in terms of three types: it has humid continental, semi-arid steppe, and humid subtropical. The eastern two-thirds of the state (especially the northeastern portion) has a [[humid continental climate]], with cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation falls during both the summer and the spring.

The western third of the state—from roughly the [[U.S. Route 83]] corridor westward—has a [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] [[steppe]] climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters are highly changeable between warm and very cold. The western region receives an average of about {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}} of precipitation per year. [[Chinook wind]]s in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the {{convert|80|°F|°C|abbr=off}} range.

The far south-central and southeastern portions of the state, including the [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] area, have a [[humid subtropical climate]] with hot and humid summers, milder winters, and more precipitation than elsewhere in Kansas. Some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state, with droughts and changeable weather between dry and humid not uncommon, and both warm and cold spells in the winter.

Temperatures in areas between U.S. Routes 83 and [[U.S. Route 81|81]], as well as the southwestern portion of the state along and south of [[U.S. Route 50|U.S. 50]], reach {{convert|90|°F|°C|abbr=}} or above on most days of June, July, and August. High humidity added to the high temperatures sends the [[heat index]] into life-threatening territory, especially in Wichita, [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Russell, Kansas|Russell]], [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]], and [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]]. Temperatures are often higher in [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]], but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature.

Although temperatures of {{convert|100|°F|°C}} or higher are not as common in areas east of U.S. 81, higher humidity and the [[urban heat island]] effect lead most summer days to heat indices between {{convert|107|°F|°C}} and {{convert|114|°F|°C}} in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], and the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]]. During the summer, nightly low temperatures in the northeastern part of the state, especially in the aforementioned large cities, struggle to fall below {{convert|80|°F|°C}}. Also, combined with humidity between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat indices can be experienced at every hour of the day.

Precipitation ranges from about {{convert|47|in|mm}} annually in the state's southeast corner to about {{convert|16|in|mm}} in the southwest. Snowfall ranges from around {{convert|5|in|mm}} in the fringes of the south, to {{convert|35|in|mm}} in the far northwest. Frost-free days range from more than 200 days in the south, to 130 days in the northwest. Thus, Kansas is the country's ninth or tenth sunniest state, depending on the source. Western Kansas is as sunny as parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].

Kansas is prone to severe weather, especially in the spring and the early-summer. Despite the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state, due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to intrusions of multiple air masses, the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunderstorms. Some of these storms become [[supercell]] thunderstorms; these can produce some [[tornado]]es, occasionally those of [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF3]] strength or higher. Kansas averages more than 50 tornadoes annually.<ref name="Annual Average Number of Tornadoes">{{cite web |title = Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953–2004 |url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] |accessdate = October 25, 2006 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archivedate = October 16, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Severe thunderstorms sometimes drop some very large [[hail]] over Kansas as well. Furthermore, these storms can even bring in flash flooding and damaging straight line winds.

According to NOAA, the all-time highest temperature recorded in Kansas is ({{convert|121|°F|°C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}) on July 24, 1936, near [[Alton, Kansas|Alton]] in [[Osborne County, Kansas|Osborne County]], and the all-time low is {{convert|-40|°F|°C}} on February 13, 1905, near [[Lebanon, Kansas|Lebanon]] in [[Smith County, Kansas|Smith County]]. Alton and Lebanon are approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} apart.

Kansas's record high of {{convert|121|°F|°C|sigfig=3}} ties with [[North Dakota]] for the fifth-highest record high in an American state, behind California ({{convert|134|°F|°C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Arizona]] ({{convert|128|°F|°C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Nevada]] ({{convert|125|°F|°C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), and [[New Mexico]] ({{convert|122|°F|°C|disp=or}}).

==Demographics==

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Kansas was 2,913,314 on July 1, 2019, a 2.11% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]] and an increase of 58,387, or 2.05%, since 2010.<ref name="PopEstUS"/> This includes a natural increase since the last census of 93,899 (246,484 births minus 152,585 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 20,742 people out of the state. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 44,847 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 65,589 people.<ref name="2006StateEstComp">{{Citation|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/states/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040916023530/http://www.census.gov/popest/states/|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 16, 2004|contribution=Cumulative Estimates of the Components of Population Change for the United States, Regions and States: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2006|title=Population Estimates|quote=Kansas population has increased at a decreasing rate, reducing the number of congressmen from 5{{nbsp}}to{{nbsp}}4 in 1992 (Congressional Redistricting Act, eff. 1992).|id=NST-EST2006-04|place=US|publisher=Census Bureau, Population Division|date=December 22, 2006}}</ref>

Kansas's capital Topeka is sometimes cited as the home of [[Pentecostalism]] as it was the site of [[Charles Fox Parham]]'s [[Bethel Bible College]], where [[glossolalia]] was first claimed as the evidence of a spiritual experience referred to as the [[baptism of the Holy Spirit]] in 1901. It is also the home of Reverend [[Charles Sheldon]], author of ''[[In His Steps]]'', and was the site where the question "[[What would Jesus do?]]" originated in a sermon of Sheldon's at Central Congregational Church.

Topeka is also home of the [[Westboro Baptist Church]], a [[hate group]] according to the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/westboro-baptist-church |title = Westboro Baptist Church |website = Southern Poverty Law Center |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110306095813/http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/westboro-baptist-church |archivedate = March 6, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> The church has garnered worldwide media attention for picketing the funerals of U.S. servicemen and women for what church members claim as "necessary to combat the fight for equality for gays and lesbians". They have sometimes successfully raised lawsuits against the city of Topeka.

Known as [[rural flight]], the last few decades have been marked by a migratory pattern out of the countryside into cities. Out of all the cities in these Midwestern states, 89% have fewer than 3,000 people, and hundreds of those have fewer than 1,000. In Kansas alone, there are more than 6,000 [[List of ghost towns in Kansas|ghost towns]] and dwindling communities,<ref>{{Citation |last = Fitzgerald |first = Daniel C |title = KS extinct locations |url = http://www.danielcfitzgerald.com/kansasextinctlocations.html |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20121206000131/http://www.danielcfitzgerald.com/kansasextinctlocations.html |archivedate = December 6, 2012 }}</ref> according to one Kansas historian, Daniel C.

Kansas has 627 [[Municipal corporation|incorporated cities]]. By state statute, cities are divided into three classes as determined by the population obtained "by any census of enumeration". A city of the third class has a population of less than 5,000, but cities reaching a population of more than 2,000 may be certified as a city of the second class. The second class is limited to cities with a population of less than 25,000, and upon reaching a population of more than 15,000, they may be certified as a city of the first class. First and second class cities are independent of any [[Civil township|township]] and are not included within the township's territory.

The State of Kansas had a $350&nbsp;million budget shortfall in February 2017.<ref name="WP_2017_revolt" /> In February 2017, S&P downgraded Kansas's credit rating to AA-.<ref name="NYT_S&P_ratings_2017" />

Nearly 90% of Kansas's land is devoted to agriculture.<ref name=":0" /> The state's agricultural outputs are cattle, sheep, [[wheat]], [[sorghum]], [[soybeans]], [[cotton]], [[pig|hogs]], [[maize|corn]], and salt. As of 2018, there were 59,600 farms in Kansas, 86 (0.14%) of which are [[Organic certification|certified organic farms]].<ref name=":0" /> The average farm in the state is about 770 acres (more than a square mile), and in 2016, the average cost of running the farm was $300,000.<ref name=":0" />

By far, the most significant agricultural crop in the state is wheat. Eastern Kansas is part of the [[Grain Belt]], an area of major grain production in the central United States. Approximately 40% of all winter wheat grown in the US is grown in Kansas.<ref name=":0" /> Roughly 95% of the wheat grown in the state is [[hard red winter wheat]].<ref name=":0" /> During 2016, farmers of conventionally grown wheat farmed 8.2&nbsp;million acres and harvested an average of 57 bushels of wheat per acre.<ref name=":0" />

The industrial outputs are transportation equipment, commercial and private aircraft, food processing, publishing, chemical products, machinery, apparel, petroleum, and mining.

Kansas is ranked eighth in [[Petroleum in the United States|US petroleum production]]. Production has experienced a steady, natural decline as it becomes increasingly difficult to extract oil over time. Since [[Price of oil|oil prices]] bottomed in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained fairly constant, with an average monthly rate of about {{convert|2.8|Moilbbl|m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} in 2004. The [[Oil price increases since 2003|recent higher prices]] have made [[carbon dioxide]] sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical.

Kansas is also ranked eighth in US natural gas production. Production has steadily declined since the mid-1990s with the gradual depletion of the [[Hugoton Natural Gas Area|Hugoton Natural Gas Field]]—the state's largest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased [[coalbed methane]] production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over {{convert|32|e9cuft|km3|abbr=off|sp=us}}.

The state's economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. Several large aircraft corporations have manufacturing facilities in Wichita and Kansas City, including [[Spirit AeroSystems]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]] ([[LearJet]]), and [[Textron Aviation]] (a merger of the former [[Cessna]], [[Hawker Aircraft|Hawker]], and [[Beechcraft]] brands). [[Boeing]] ended a decades-long history of manufacturing in Kansas between 2012 and 2013.

Major companies headquartered in Kansas include the [[Sprint Corporation]] (with world headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]]), [[YRC Worldwide]] (Overland Park), [[Garmin]] ([[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]]), [[Payless Shoes]] (national headquarters and major distribution facilities in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]), and [[Koch Industries]] (with national headquarters in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]), and [[Coleman Company|Coleman]] (headquarters in Wichita) . Telephone company [[Embarq]] formerly had its national headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]] before its acquisition by [[CenturyTel]] in 2009, and still employs several hundred people in [[Gardner, Kansas|Gardner]].

Kansas is also home to three major military installations: [[Fort Leavenworth]] (Army), [[Fort Riley]] (Army), and [[McConnell Air Force Base]] (Air Force). Approximately 25,000 active duty soldiers and airmen are stationed at these bases which also employ approximately 8,000 civilian DoD employees. The US Army Reserve also has the 451st Expeditionary Sustainment Command headquartered in Wichita that serves reservists and their units from around the region. The Kansas Air National Guard has units at [[Forbes Field]] in Topeka and the 184th Intelligence Wing in Wichita. The Smoky Hill Weapons Range, a detachment of the Intelligence Wing, is one of the largest and busiest bombing ranges in the nation. During World War II, Kansas was home to numerous Army Air Corps training fields for training new pilots and aircrew. Many of those airfields live on today as municipal airports.

===Taxes===

Tax is collected by the [[Kansas Department of Revenue]].

Revenue shortfalls resulting from lower than expected tax collections and slower growth in personal income following a 1998 permanent tax reduction have contributed to the substantial growth in the state's debt level as bonded debt increased from $1.16&nbsp;billion in 1998 to $3.83&nbsp;billion in 2006. Some increase in debt was expected as the state continues with its 10-year Comprehensive Transportation Program enacted in 1999.

In 2003, Kansas had three income brackets for income tax calculation, ranging from 3.5% to 6.45%.

The state sales tax in Kansas is 6.15%. Various cities and counties in Kansas have an additional local sales tax. Except during the 2001 [[recession]] (March–November 2001), when monthly sales tax collections were flat, collections have trended higher as the economy has grown and two rate increases have been enacted. If there had been no change in sales tax rates or in the economy, the total sales tax collections for 2003 would have been $1,797&nbsp;million, compared to $805.3&nbsp;million in 1990. However, they instead amounted to $1,630&nbsp;million an inflation-adjusted reduction of 10%. The state sales tax is a combined destination-based tax, meaning a single tax is applied that includes state, county, and local taxes, and the rate is based on where the consumer takes possession of the goods or services. Thanks to the destination structure and the numerous local special taxing districts, Kansas has 920 separate sales tax rates ranging from 6.5% to 11.5%.<ref>{{cite web |title = Publication 1700 |url = https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |website = Kansas Department of Revenue |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405025326/https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> This taxing scheme, known as "[[Streamlined Sales Tax]]" was adopted on October 1, 2005, under the governorship of [[Kathleen Sebelius]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Streamlined Sales Tax—Kansas |url = http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |website = Streamlined Sales Tax |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405090353/http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Groceries are subject to sales tax in the state. All sales tax collected is remitted to the state department of revenue, and local taxes are then distributed to the various taxing agencies.

As of June 2004, [[Moody's Investors Service]] ranked the state 14th for net tax-supported debt per capita. As a percentage of personal income, it was at 3.8%—above the median value of 2.5% for all rated states and having risen from a value of less than 1% in 1992. The state has a statutory requirement to maintain cash reserves of at least 7.5% of expenses at the end of each fiscal year; however, lawmakers can vote to override the rule, and did so during the most recent budget agreement.

==Transportation==

[[File:I35Kansas.jpg|thumb| ]]

===Highways===

Kansas is served by two [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]] with one [[Ring road|beltway]], two [[spur route]]s, and three [[bypass (road)|bypasses]], with over {{convert|874|mi|km}} in all. The first section of Interstate in the nation was opened on [[Interstate 70 in Kansas|Interstate&nbsp;70]] (I-70) just west of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] on November 14, 1956.<ref>{{Citation |publisher = Kansas Department of Transportation |url = https://www.ksdot.org/interstate50th/KsStory_I70.asp |title = I-70—the First Open Interstate |accessdate = October 7, 2016 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161026180917/https://www.ksdot.org/interstate50th/KsStory_I70.asp |archivedate = October 26, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

I-70 is a major east–west route connecting to [[Denver]], Colorado and [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Cities along this route (from west to east) include [[Colby, Kansas|Colby]], [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]], [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Junction City, Kansas|Junction City]], [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], [[Bonner Springs, Kansas|Bonner Springs]], and [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]].

[[Interstate 35 in Kansas|I-35]] is a major north–south route connecting to [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma and [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. Cities along this route (from south to north) include [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[El Dorado, Kansas|El Dorado]], [[Emporia, Kansas|Emporia]], [[Ottawa, Kansas|Ottawa]], and Kansas City (and suburbs).

Spur routes serve as connections between the two major routes. [[Interstate 135 (Kansas)|I-135]], a north–south route, connects I-35 at Wichita to I-70 at Salina. [[Interstate 335 (Kansas)|I-335]], a southwest–northeast route, connects I-35 at Emporia to I-70 at Topeka. I-335 and portions of I-35 and I-70 make up the [[Kansas Turnpike]]. Bypasses include [[Interstate 470 (Kansas)|I-470]] around Topeka, [[Interstate 235 (Kansas)|I-235]] around Wichita, and [[Interstate 670 (Kansas)|I-670]] in downtown Kansas City. [[Interstate 435 (Kansas)|I-435]] is a beltway around the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]] while [[Interstate 635 (Kansas–Missouri)|I-635]] bypasses through Kansas City.

[[U.S. Route 69 in Kansas|U.S. Route&nbsp;69]] (US-69) travels south to north, from Oklahoma to Missouri. The highway passes through the eastern section of Kansas, traveling through [[Baxter Springs, Kansas|Baxter Springs]], [[Pittsburg, Kansas|Pittsburg]], [[Frontenac, Kansas|Frontenac]], [[Fort Scott, Kansas|Fort Scott]], [[Louisburg, Kansas|Louisburg]], and the Kansas City area.
[[File:National-atlas-kansas.PNG|thumb| ]]

Kansas also has the country's third largest state highway system after Texas and California. This is because of the high number of counties and [[county seat]]s (105) and their intertwining.

In January 2004, the [[Kansas Department of Transportation]] (KDOT) announced the new Kansas [[5-1-1|511]] traveler information service.<ref>{{Cite press release |publisher = Kansas Department of Transportation |date = January 22, 2004 |url = http://www.ksdot.org/archive/offtransinfo/News04/511_Release.htm |title = KDOT Launches New Traveler Information Service |accessdate = July 14, 2006 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060118133422/http://www.ksdot.org/archive/offtransinfo/News04/511_Release.htm |archivedate = January 18, 2006 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> By dialing 511, callers will get access to information about road conditions, construction, closures, detours and weather conditions for the state highway system.

The state's only major commercial ([[Airspace class (United States)|Class C]]) airport is [[Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport]], located along [[U.S. Route 54 (Kansas)|US-54]] on the western edge of the city. [[Manhattan Regional Airport]] in [[Manhattan, Kansas|Manhattan]] offers daily flights to [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] and Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport]], making it the second-largest commercial airport in the state.<ref>{{cite web |title = Manhattan Airport Official Site |url = http://www.flymhk.com/ |accessdate = July 14, 2010 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100529075116/http://www.flymhk.com/ |archivedate = May 29, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Most air travelers in northeastern Kansas fly out of [[Kansas City International Airport]], located in [[Platte County, Missouri]], as well as [[Topeka Regional Airport]] in the state's capital.

In the state's southeastern part, people often use [[Tulsa International Airport]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] or [[Joplin Regional Airport]] in [[Joplin, Missouri]]. For those in the far western part of the state, [[Denver International Airport]] is a popular option. Connecting flights are also available from smaller Kansas airports in [[Dodge City Regional Airport|Dodge City]], [[Garden City Regional Airport|Garden City]], [[Hays Regional Airport|Hays]], [[Hutchinson Municipal Airport (Kansas)|Hutchinson]], [[Liberal Mid-America Regional Airport|Liberal]], or [[Salina Municipal Airport|Salina]].

Dotted across the state are smaller regional and municipal airports, including the [[Lawrence Municipal Airport (Kansas)|Lawrence Municipal Airport]], which houses many aircraft for the city of Lawrence and the [[University of Kansas]], Miami County Airport, Wamego Airport, [[Osage City Municipal Airport]], which is the headquarters of ''Skydive Kansas'', [[Garden City Regional Airport]], [[Manhattan Regional Airport]], and [[Dodge City Regional Airport]].

Since the mid-20th century, Kansas has remained one of the most socially conservative states in the nation. The 1990s brought the defeat of prominent Democrats, including [[Dan Glickman]], and the [[Kansas State Board of Education]]'s 1999 decision to eliminate [[evolution]] from the state teaching standards, a decision that was later reversed.<ref>''Los Angeles Times''.

(book)|What's the Matter with Kansas?]]''.

Kansas has a history of many firsts in legislative initiatives—it was the first state to institute a system of [[workers' compensation]] (1910) and to regulate the [[Security (finance)|securities]] industry (1911). Kansas also permitted [[women's suffrage]] in 1912, almost a decade before the federal constitution was amended to require it.<ref>Scott and Scott (1982), [https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA166 p. 166]</ref> Suffrage in all states would not be guaranteed until ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] in 1920.

The [[council–manager government]] model was adopted by many larger Kansas cities in the years following World War I while many American cities were being run by [[political machine]]s or [[organized crime]], notably the [[Tom Pendergast|Pendergast Machine]] in neighboring [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Kansas was also at the center of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]] of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]'', a 1954 Supreme Court decision that banned racially segregated schools throughout the U.S.

The state backed Republicans [[Wendell Willkie]] and [[Thomas E. Dewey]] in 1940 and 1944, respectively. Kansas also supported Dewey in 1948 despite the presence of incumbent president [[Harry S. Truman]], who hailed from [[Independence, Missouri]], approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of the Kansas–Missouri state line. Since Roosevelt carried Kansas in 1932 and 1936, only one Democrat has won Kansas's electoral votes, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1964.

In 2008, Governor [[Kathleen Sebelius]] vetoed permits for the construction of new coal-fired energy plants in Kansas, saying: "We know that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change. As an agricultural state, Kansas is particularly vulnerable. Therefore, reducing pollutants benefits our state not only in the short term—but also for generations of Kansans to come."<ref>{{cite web |author =  |url = http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2008/2008-03-21-01.asp |title = Kansas Governor Rejects Two Coal-Fired Power Plants |publisher = Ens-newswire.com |date = March 21, 2008 |accessdate = July 31, 2010 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110202000925/http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2008/2008-03-21-01.asp |archivedate = February 2, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> However, shortly after Mark Parkinson became governor in 2009 upon Sebelius's resignation to become Secretary of U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Parkinson announced a compromise plan to allow construction of a coal-fired plant.

In 2010, [[Sam Brownback]] was elected governor with 63 percent of the state vote. He was sworn in as governor in 2011, Kansas's first Republican governor in eight years.

[[File:United States presidential election in Kansas, 2016.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.4| ]]

The state's current delegation to the [[Congress of the United States]] includes [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senators [[Pat Roberts]] of [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] and [[Jerry Moran]] of [[Manhattan, Kansas|Manhattan]]; and Republican Representatives [[Roger Marshall (politician)|Roger Marshall]] of [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]] ([[1st Congressional District of Kansas|District 1]]), [[Steve Watkins]] ([[2nd Congressional District of Kansas|District 2]]), [[Ron Estes]] of [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] ([[4th Congressional District of Kansas|District 4]]), and Democratic Representative [[Sharice Davids]] ([[3rd Congressional District of Kansas|District 3]]). Davids is the second Native American to represent Kansas in Congress, after Republican [[Charles Curtis]] ([[Kaw people|Kaw]]).

Historically, Kansas has been strongly Republican, dating from the [[Antebellum era|Antebellum]] age when the Republican Party was created out of the movement opposing the extension of slavery into Kansas Territory. Kansas has not elected a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the U.S. Senate since the 1932 election, when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] won his first term as president in the wake of the [[Great Depression]]. This is the longest Senate losing streak for either party in a single state. Senator [[Sam Brownback]] was a candidate for the Republican party nomination for president in 2008. Brownback was not a candidate for re-election to a third full term in 2010, but he was elected Governor in that year's general election. Moran defeated Tiahrt for the Republican nomination for Brownback's seat in the August 2010 primary, then won a landslide general election victory over Democrat Lisa Johnston.

The only non-Republican presidential candidates Kansas has given its electoral vote to are Populist [[James Baird Weaver|James Weaver]] and Democrats [[Woodrow Wilson]], Franklin Roosevelt (twice), and [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]]. In 2004, [[George W. Bush]] won the state's six electoral votes by an overwhelming margin of 25 percentage points with 62% of the vote. The only two counties to support Democrat [[John Kerry]] in that election were [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte]], which contains [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], and [[Douglas County, Kansas|Douglas]], home to the [[University of Kansas]], located in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]. The 2008 election brought similar results as [[John McCain]] won the state with 57% of the votes. Douglas, Wyandotte, and [[Crawford County, Kansas|Crawford County]] were the only counties in support of President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapPKS |title = 2008 Election Results—Kansas |publisher = CNN |accessdate = July 31, 2010 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081107105721/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapPKS |archivedate = November 7, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Abilene was the boyhood home to Republican president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and he maintained lifelong ties to family and friends there. Kansas was the adult home of two losing Republican candidates (Governor [[Alf Landon]] in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] and Senator Bob Dole in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]]).

The ''New York Times'' reported in September 2014 that as the Democratic candidate for Senator has tried to drop out of the race, independent [[Greg Orman]] has attracted enough bipartisan support to seriously challenge the reelection bid of Republican Pat Roberts:
:Kansas politics have been roiled in recent years. The rise of the Tea Party and the election of President Obama have prompted Republicans to embrace a purer brand of conservatism and purge what had long been a robust moderate wing from its ranks. Mr. Roberts has sought to adapt to this new era, voting against spending bills that included projects for the state that he had sought.<ref>Jonathan Martin, "National G.O.P.

===State laws===

{{See also|Alcohol laws of Kansas}}

The [[legal drinking age]] in Kansas is 21. In lieu of the state retail sales tax, a 10% Liquor Drink Tax is collected for liquor consumed on the licensed premises and an 8% Liquor Enforcement Tax is collected on retail purchases. Although the sale of cereal [[malt beverage]] (also known as [[3.2 beer]]) was legalized in 1937, the first post-[[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] legalization of alcoholic liquor did not occur until the [[Kansas Constitution|state's constitution]] was amended in 1948. The following year the [[Kansas Legislature|Legislature]] enacted the Liquor Control Act which created a system of regulating, licensing, and taxing, and the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) was created to enforce the act. The power to regulate cereal malt beverage remains with the cities and counties. Liquor-by-the-drink did not become legal until passage of an amendment to the state's constitution in 1986 and additional legislation the following year. As of November 2006, Kansas still has 29 [[dry county|dry counties]] and only 17 counties have passed liquor-by-the-drink with no food sales requirement.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ksrevenue.org/abcsupplierinfo.htm |title = Liquor Licensee and Supplier Information |publisher = Alcoholic Beverage Control, Kansas Department of Revenue |accessdate = January 18, 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061208194850/http://www.ksrevenue.org/abcsupplierinfo.htm |archivedate = December 8, 2006 }}</ref> Today there are more than 2,600 liquor and 4,000 cereal malt beverage licensees in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ksrevenue.org/abchistory.htm |title = History of Alcoholic Beverages in Kansas |publisher = Alcoholic Beverage Control, Kansas Department of Revenue |year = 2000 |accessdate = January 18, 2007 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070117070410/http://www.ksrevenue.org/abchistory.htm |archivedate = January 17, 2007 }}</ref>

==Education==

{{Main|Education in Kansas}}

Education in Kansas is governed at the primary and secondary school level by the [[Kansas State Board of Education]]. The state's public colleges and universities are supervised by the [[Kansas Board of Regents]].

Twice since 1999 the Board of Education has approved changes in the state science curriculum standards that encouraged the teaching of [[intelligent design]]. Both times, the standards were reversed after changes in the composition of the board in the next election.

The state anthem is the American classic [[Home on the Range]], written by Kansan Brewster Higley. Another song, the official state march adopted by the Kansas Legislature in 1935 is called ''The Kansas March'', which features the lyrics, "Blue sky above us, silken strands of heat, Rim of the far horizon, where earth and heaven meet, Kansas as a temple, stands in velvet sod, Shrine which the sunshine, sanctifies to God."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/kansas-march/19109|title=Kansas March—Kansapedia—Kansas Historical Society|website=www.kshs.org}}</ref>

===Literature===

The state's most famous appearance in literature was as the home of Dorothy Gale, the main character in the novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' (1900). [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]'s ''[[Little House on the Prairie (novel)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', published in 1935, is another well-known tale about Kansas.

Kansas was also the setting of the 1965 best-seller ''[[In Cold Blood]]'', described by its author [[Truman Capote]] as a "nonfiction novel". Mixing fact and fiction, the book chronicles the events and aftermath of the 1959 murder of a wealthy farmer and his family who lived in the small West Kansas town of [[Holcomb, Kansas|Holcomb]] in [[Finney County]].

The fictional town of [[Smallville]], Kansas is the childhood home of Clark Kent/[[Superman]] in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]]. Also Keystone City is a Kansas city where [[The Flash]] works and  lives.

The science fiction novella ''[[A Boy and His Dog]]'', as well as the [[A Boy and His Dog (1975 film)|film]] based on it,<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=A Boy and His Dog|authorlink=Richard Eder|first=Richard|last=Eder|date=June 17, 1976|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF1738E061BC4F52DFB066838D669EDE}}</ref> take place in post-apocalyptic [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]].

It was written by Kansan [[Clare Vanderpool]].

[[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] is the setting for a number of science fiction writer [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]]'s novels.

The first film theater in Kansas was the [[Patee Theater]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]. Most theaters at the time showed films only as part of [[vaudeville]] acts but not as an exclusive and stand alone form of entertainment. Though the [[Patee family]] had been involved in [[vaudeville]], they believed films could carry the evening without other variety acts, but in order to show the films it was necessary for the Patee's to establish a generating plant (back in 1903 Lawrence was not yet fully electrified). The Patee Theater was one of the first of its kind west of the [[Mississippi River]]. The specialized equipment like the [[projector]] came from [[New York City|New York]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Butters |first1=Gerald R. |title=Banned in Kansas: Motion Picture Censorship, 1915-1966 |year=2007 |url=https://archive.org/details/bannedinkansasmo00butt |url-access=registration |publisher=University of Missouri Press}}</ref>

Kansas has been the setting of many award-winning and popular American films, as well as being the home of some of the oldest operating cinemas in the world.

* The 1967 feature film [[In Cold Blood (film)|''In Cold Blood'']], like the book on which it was based, was set in various locations across Kansas. Many of the scenes in the film were filmed at the exact locations where the events profiled in the book took place. A [[In Cold Blood (miniseries)|1996 TV miniseries]] was also based on the book.
* The 1988 film ''[[Kansas (film)|Kansas]]'' starred [[Andrew McCarthy]] as a traveler who met up with a dangerous wanted drifter played by [[Matt Dillon]].

Sporting Kansas City, who have played their home games at [[Village West]] in [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], since 2008, are the first top-tier [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|professional sports league]] and first [[Major League Soccer]] team to be located within Kansas. In 2011 the team moved to their new home, a $165m [[soccer specific stadium]] now known as [[Children's Mercy Park]].

Historically, Kansans have supported the [[Major professional sports leagues of Canada and the United States|major league]] sports teams of [[Kansas City, Missouri]], including the [[Kansas City Royals]] ([[Major League Baseball|MLB]]), and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] ([[National Football League|NFL]]), in part because the home stadiums for these teams are a few miles from the Kansas border. The Chiefs and the Royals play at the [[Truman Sports Complex]], located about {{convert|10|mi|km}} from the Kansas–Missouri state line. [[FC Kansas City]], a charter member of the [[National Women's Soccer League]], played the [[2013 National Women's Soccer League season|2013 season]], the first for both the team and the league, on the Kansas side of the metropolitan area, but played on the Missouri side until folding after the [[2017 National Women's Soccer League season|2017 season]]. From 1973 to 1997 the [[Flagship station|flagship radio station]] for the Royals was [[WIBW (AM)|WIBW]] in Topeka.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4179/is_20021202/ai_n11792020/pg_3/ |title = Making Airwaves Through History |publisher = Findarticles.com |date = December 2, 2002 |accessdate = July 31, 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110515020957/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4179/is_20021202/ai_n11792020/pg_3/ |archivedate = May 15, 2011 }}</ref>

Some Kansans, mostly from the westernmost parts of the state, support the professional sports teams of [[Denver]], particularly the [[Denver Broncos]] of the NFL.

Two major [[auto racing]] facilities are located in Kansas. The [[Kansas Speedway]] located in Kansas City hosts races of the [[NASCAR]], [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]], and [[Auto Racing Club of America|ARCA]] circuits. Also, the [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) holds [[drag racing]] events at [[Heartland Park Topeka]]. The [[Sports Car Club of America]] has its national headquarters in Topeka.

=====History=====

The history of professional sports in Kansas probably dates from the establishment of the [[minor league baseball]] Topeka Capitals and [[Leavenworth Soldiers]] in 1886 in the [[Western League (original)|Western League]].<ref name="Evans">{{cite journal |last = Evans |first = Harold |title = Baseball in Kansas, 1867–1940 |journal = Kansas Historical Quarterly |year = 1940 |url = http://www.kancoll.org/khq/1940/40_2_evans.htm |accessdate = February 18, 2008 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316152651/http://www.kancoll.org/khq/1940/40_2_evans.htm |archivedate = March 16, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="Madden">{{cite book |last = Madden |first = W.C. |last2 = Stewart |first2 = Patrick |title = The Western League: A Baseball History, 1885 through 1999 |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-7864-1003-3 }}</ref> The African-American [[Bud Fowler]] played on the Topeka team that season, one year before the "[[Baseball color line|color line]]" descended on professional baseball.<ref name=Madden />

In 1887, the Western League was dominated by a reorganized Topeka team called the [[Topeka Golden Giants (1887)|Golden Giants]]: a high-priced collection of major leaguer players, including [[Bug Holliday]], [[Jim Conway (baseball)|Jim Conway]], [[Dan Stearns]], [[Perry Werden]] and [[Jimmy Macullar]], which won the league by 15½ games.<ref name=Madden /> On April 10, 1887, the Golden Giants also won an exhibition game from the defending [[1886 World Series|World Series]] champions, the [[St. Louis Browns (NL)|St. Louis Browns]] (the present-day Cardinals), by a score of 12–9. However, Topeka was unable to support the team, and it disbanded after one year.

The first night game in the history of professional baseball was played in Independence on April 28, 1930 when the Muscogee (Oklahoma) Indians beat the Independence Producers 13–3 in a minor league game sanctioned by the Western League of the Western Baseball Association with 1,500 fans attending the game. The permanent lighting system was first used for an exhibition game on April 17, 1930 between the Independence Producers and House of David semi-professional baseball team of Benton Harbor, Michigan with the Independence team winning 9–1 before a crowd of 1,700 spectators.<ref>Bowman, Larry G.

The governing body for intercollegiate sports in the United States, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), was headquartered in [[Johnson County, Kansas]] from 1952 until moving to Indianapolis in 1999.<ref>Jim Davis, [http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/1997/06/09/editorial4.html Loss of NCAA headquarters not related to incentives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410050947/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/1997/06/09/editorial4.html |date=April 10, 2017 }}, ''Kansas City Business Journal'' (June 8, 1997).</ref><ref>Sam Epstein, ''Sports Law'' (Cengage Learning, 2013), p. 19.</ref>

=====NCAA Division I schools=====

[[File:Allen Fieldhouse (3301441111).jpg|thumb|Allen Fieldhouse in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], home of the Kansas Jayhawks]]

While there are no franchises of the four major professional sports within the state, many Kansans are fans of the state's major college sports teams, especially the [[Kansas Jayhawks|Jayhawks]] of the [[University of Kansas]] (KU), and the [[Kansas State Wildcats|Wildcats]] of [[Kansas State University]] (KSU or "K-State"). The teams are rivals in the [[Big 12 Conference]].

Both KU and K-State have tradition-rich programs in men's basketball. The Jayhawks are a perennial national power, ranking second in all-time victories among NCAA programs, behind [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]. The Jayhawks have won five national titles, including NCAA tournament championships in 1952, 1988, and 2008. They also were retroactively awarded national championships by the [[Helms Foundation]] for 1922 and 1923. K-State also had a long stretch of success on the hardwood, lasting from the 1940s to the 1980s, making four [[Final Four]]s during that stretch. In 1988, KU and K-State met in the [[Elite Eight]], KU taking the game 71–58. After a 12-year absence, the Wildcats returned to the NCAA tournament in 2008, and advanced to the Elite Eight in 2010 and 2018. KU is fifth all-time with 15 Final Four appearances, while K-State's four appearances are tied for 17th.

Conversely, success on the [[American football|gridiron]] has been less frequent for both KSU and KU. However, there have been recent breakthroughs for both schools' football teams. The Jayhawks won the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] for the first time in three tries in 2008, capping a 12–1 season, the best in school history. And when [[Bill Snyder]] arrived to coach at K-State in 1989, he turned the Wildcats from one of the worst college football programs in America,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Looney |first=Douglas |title=Futility U |journal=Sports Illustrated |date=September 4, 1989 |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/09/04/120464/futility-u-kansas-state-winless-since-1986-has-one-claim-to-fame-it-is-americas-most-hapless-team}}</ref> into a national force for most of the 1990s and early 2000s. The team won the [[Fiesta Bowl]] in 1997, achieved an undefeated (11–0) regular season and No.{{nbsp}}1 ranking in 1998, and took the [[Big 12 Conference]] championship in 2003. After three seasons in which K-State football languished, Snyder came out of retirement in 2009 and guided them to the top of the college football ranks again, finishing second in the Big 12 in 2011 and earning a berth in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]], and winning the Big 12 again in 2012.

[[Wichita State University]], which also fields teams (called the [[Wichita State Shockers|Shockers]]) in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], is best known for its baseball and basketball programs. In baseball, the Shockers won the [[College World Series]] in 1989. In men's basketball, they appeared in the Final Four in 1965 and 2013, and entered the 2014 NCAA tournament unbeaten. The school also fielded a [[American football|football]] team from 1897 to 1986. The Shocker football team is tragically known for a [[Wichita State University football team plane crash|plane crash]] in 1970 that killed 31 people, including 14 players.

=====NCAA Division II schools=====

Notable success has also been achieved by the state's smaller schools in football. [[Pittsburg State University]], an NCAA Division II participant, has claimed four national titles in football, two in the NAIA and most recently the 2011 NCAA Division II national title. Pittsburg State became the winningest NCAA Division II football program in 1995. PSU passed Hillsdale College at the top of the all-time victories list in the 1995 season on its march to the national runner-up finish. The Gorillas, in 96 seasons of intercollegiate competition, have accumulated 579 victories, posting a 579–301–48 overall mark.

[[Washburn University]], in Topeka, won the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] Men's Basketball Championship in 1987. The [[Fort Hays State University]] men won the 1996 NCAA Division II title with a 34–0 record, and the Washburn women won the 2005 NCAA Division II crown. St. Benedict's College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, won the 1954 and 1967 Men's NAIA Basketball Championships.

The [[Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference]] has its roots as one of the oldest college sport conferences in existence and participates in the NAIA and all ten member schools are in the state of Kansas. Other smaller school conferences that have some members in Kansas are the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association]] the [[Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference]], the [[Midwest Christian College Conference]], and the [[Heart of America Athletic Conference]]. Many [[junior college]]s also have active athletic programs.

[[Emporia State]]'s women's basketball team, under head coach [[Brandon Schneider]], who is now serving as the women's basketball coach at the University of Kansas, has seen success as well. In 2010 the team won the NCAA Division II National Championship. Emporia State and Washburn in Topeka share a heated rivalry in all sports, mostly due to the close proximity of both cities.

=====Junior colleges=====

The [[Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference]] has been heralded as one of the best conferences in all of [[NJCAA]] football, with [[Garden City Community College]], [[Independence Community College]], and [[Butler County Community College]] all consistently in contention for national championships.

====High school====

The [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] (KSHSAA) is the organization which oversees interscholastic competition in the state of Kansas at the high school level. It oversees both athletic and non-athletic competition, and sponsors championships in several sports and activities. The association is perhaps best known for devising the overtime system now used for almost all football games below the professional level (which has also been adopted at all levels of [[Canadian football]]).
