{{short description|Bachelor's degree awarded for undergraduate study in liberal arts, the sciences or both}}'''Bachelor of Arts''' ('''BA''' or '''AB'''; from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus artium}}'' or ''{{lang|la|artium baccalaureus}}'') is the holder of a [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] program in the arts and sciences. A Bachelor of Arts degree course is generally completed in three or four years, depending on the country and institution.

* Degree attainment typically takes four years to get in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Nepal]], [[Ghana]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Armenia]], [[Kenya]], [[Brunei]], [[Greece]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Qatar]], [[Thailand]], [[Russia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[South Korea]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Turkey]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[United States]], and most of the [[Americas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US5/REF/gpa.html|title=FAST-US-5 United States Education Reference File<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref>
* Degree attainment typically takes three years in most of the [[European Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Albania]], [[Australia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[India]], [[New Zealand]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Singapore]], the [[Caribbean]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec]].

==Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa==
{{ anchor | Australia | New Zealand | South Africa | Canada}}
In colleges and universities in Australia, New Zealand, Nepal, and South Africa, the BA degree can be taken over three years of full-time study.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144|title=Bachelor of Arts degrees|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401072859/http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|archive-date=2010-04-01}}</ref> Students must pursue at least one [[academic major|major]] area of study and units from that subject are usually studied in each year, though sometimes students may choose to complete upper-level classes in the same year and as a result, can leave space for elective subjects from a different field. At some universities, students may choose to pursue a second major; alternatively, the remainder of the degree is taken up with a minor area of study (in the first two years) and other individual or stream-based subjects.

Education in [[Canada]] is controlled by the provinces and can be very different depending on the province. Canadian universities typically offer four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees. In many universities and colleges, Bachelor of Arts degrees are differentiated either as BA or as honours BA degrees. Honours is an academic distinction indicating that a student achieved his or her BA degree with a sufficiently high overall grade point average; in addition, some programs may require more education than non-honours programs.

==Netherlands==
In the [[Netherlands]], the BA and Master of Arts (MA) degrees were introduced in 2002. Until then, a single program led to the ''[[doctorandus]]'' degree, which comprised the same course load as the bachelor's and master's programs combined. The title ''doctorandus'' was used in almost all fields of study; other titles were used for legal studies (''meester'', Dutch for master, abbreviated ''Mr.'') and engineering (''[[ingenieur]]''). Those who had already started the ''doctorandus'' program could, on completing it, opt for the ''doctorandus'' degree (entitling them to use "Drs." in front of their name) or could use the master's degree (postnominal letters) in accordance with the new standard.

==Germany==
In Germany, university-level education usually happens in either a ''Universität'' (plural: ''Universitäten'') or a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' (plural: ''Fachhochschulen''); both can be referred to as a ''Hochschule'', which is the generic term in Germany for all institutions awarding academic degrees. Fachhochschule is often translated as "University of Applied Sciences". ''Universitäten'' place greater emphasis on fundamental science and background in theory, while ''Fachhochschulen'' are generally designed with a focus on teaching professional skills. Degrees earned at ''Universitäten'' and ''Fachhochschulen'' are legally equivalent.

In Germany, the B.A. course normally lasts between three and three and a half years – six or seven semesters – and the degree is awarded after the student earns between 180 and 210 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].

==United Kingdom and Ireland==
{{Main|British undergraduate degree classification}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] (excluding [[Scotland]]) and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the first degree course normally lasts three years, but nomenclature varies: 19th-century and later universities usually distinguish between arts and sciences subjects by awarding either a B.A. or B.Sc. degree. However, some older or [[ancient universities]], such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] traditionally award B.A.s to undergraduates having completed the final examinations, e.g. Part II [[Tripos]] (Cambridge), Final Honour Schools (Oxford), Moderatorship (Dublin), in most subjects including the sciences. Some new [[plate glass university|plate glass universities]] established in the 1960s, such as [[University of York|York]] and [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] originally followed the practice of Oxford and Cambridge by awarding B.A.s in all subjects, but have since changed to awarding B.Sc. degrees in science subjects. At Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] can be claimed, usually twenty-one terms after [[matriculation]]. For many centuries, the bachelor's degree was an intermediate step and was awarded for much of the work carried out in later times at secondary schools. The names of the final secondary school exams in France and Spain (and increasingly in the UK—the [[International Baccalaureate]]) come from this: le [[Baccalauréat]] and el ''Bachillerato'', respectively.

The [[Ancient Universities of Scotland]] award a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degree to humanities or arts graduates, but a B.Sc. to science graduates. This course takes four years for an honours degree and three for an ordinary.  In Scotland, it is possible to opt to take an ordinary degree rather than this simply ranking below a third class honours (for example, B.A. with distinction, merit or pass).

A Bachelor of Arts is entitled to the designation B.A. for an ordinary/pass degree and B.A. (Hons) for an honours degree. Students who completed an honours B.A. sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' or '(Hons)' after the degree abbreviation in parentheses. An honours degree is always awarded in one of four classes depending upon the marks gained in the final assessments and examinations. The top students are awarded a first-class degree, followed by an upper second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:1), a lower second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:2), and those with the lowest marks gain a third-class degree. An ordinary or unclassified degree (which does not give the graduate the right to add '(Hons)') may be awarded if a student has completed the full honours degree course but has not obtained the total required passes sufficient to merit a third-class honours degree. Typically these degrees lack the final year requirement of a dissertation.
