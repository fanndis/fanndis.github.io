The '''Center for Global Development''' ('''CGD''') is a nonprofit [[think tank]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[London]] that focuses on [[international development]].

It was founded in November 2001 by former senior U.S. official [[Edward W. Scott]], director of the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] [[C.&nbsp;Fred Bergsten]], and [[Nancy Birdsall]]. Birdsall, the former Vice President of the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] and former Director of the Policy Research Department at the [[World Bank]], became the Center's first President. [[Lawrence Summers]] was unanimously elected in March 2014 by the CGD Board of Directors to succeed founding Board Chair Edward Scott, Jr., on May 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/article/lawrence-summers-become-board-chair-center-global-development |title=Lawrence Summers to Become Board Chair of the Center for Global Development |publisher=Centre for Global Development |accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref>

CGD was ranked the 13th most prominent think tank in the international development sphere by [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s "2015 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=think_tanks |title=Global Go To Think Tank Index Report |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}</ref> In 2009,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cgdev.org/article/think-tank-index-foreign-policy-magazine | title=The Think Tank Index (Foreign Policy Magazine) | date=February 1, 2009 | website=Center for Global Development | accessdate=June 8, 2016}}</ref> [[Foreign Policy Magazine]]'s Think-Tank Index listed CGD as one of the top 15 overall think-tanks in the USA.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4598&page=1 |title=Coming Soon |publisher=Foreign Policy |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520061336/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4598&page=1# |archive-date=May 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> CGD's stated mission is "to reduce global poverty and inequality by encouraging policy change in the United States and other rich countries through rigorous research and active engagement with the policy community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/section/about/ |title=About CGD |publisher=Cgdev.org |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref> The Center considers itself to be a "think and do" tank, with an emphasis on producing research that is channeled into practical policy proposals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cgdev.org/publication/building-think-and-do-tank-dozen-lessons-first-dozen-years-center-global-development | title=Building a Think-and-Do Tank: A Dozen Lessons from the First Dozen Years of the Center for Global Development | date=January 14, 2014 |website=Center for Global Development | accessdate=June 8, 2016}}</ref>

CGD is well known for leading debt-relief programs, specifically in [[Nigeria]] and [[Liberia]]. CGD Vice President Todd Moss first proposed the Nigerian debt buy-back, which resulted in the [[Paris Club]] of rich nations forgiving 60% of $31 billion of debt.<ref name=clean>“Clean Slate”, ''The Economist'', October 2005</ref> Former CGD senior fellow Steve Radelet advised [[Liberia]]n President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] and her senior advisors on debt relief and aid coordination.

CGD is also known for creating the program called [[advance market commitments]] to encourage vaccine development for specific diseases. The [[G7]] endorsed the approach and the [[Gates Foundation]] and five countries gave $1.5 billion to create a vaccine against strains of [[pneumonia]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Vaccine-Delivery | title=Vaccine Delivery Strategy Overniew | last= | first= | date= | website=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation | accessdate=12 October 2018 }}</ref>

In cooperation with [[Foreign Policy (magazine)|''Foreign Policy'']], CGD has published the [[Commitment to Development Index]] since 2003. The annual index ranks countries based on how their foreign aid, trade, migration, investment, environment, security and technology policies encourage global development.<ref name="Commitment to Development Index">{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/cdi/ |title=Commitment to Development Index |publisher=Cgdev.org |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref>

The Center for Global Development in Europe was established in October 2011 with the aim of engaging with and learning from policymakers, academics, and researchers in Europe, and bringing the CGD blend of evidence-led, high-quality research and engagement to European policymaking and engagement about development. [http://www.cgdev.org/page/center-global-development-europe "CGD in Europe"] research initiatives include [http://www.cgdev.org/initiative/europe-beyond-aid "Europe Beyond Aid"], [http://www.cgdev.org/page/development-impact-bond-working-group Development Impact Bonds], and [http://www.cgdev.org/topics/transparency Illicit Financial Flows].

In November 2013, CGD purchased a [http://www.cgdev.org/blog/cgd-moving new headquarters] that includes a 170-seat state-of-the-art conference center, a 60-seat boardroom/ideas lab, and a multimedia studio.

==Research==
CGD conducts research within a range of topics that impact [[global poverty]] and people of the developing world. Topics include [[aid effectiveness]], education, [[globalization]] and [[global health]], as well as the impact of trade and [[Human migration|migration]] on development.

The Center is well known for its research on [[aid effectiveness]]. CGD President [[Nancy Birdsall]] recently developed Cash on Delivery (COD) Aid, an initiative aimed to improve aid effectiveness by focusing foreign aid on outcomes, not inputs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1423949/ |title=Cash on Delivery Aid Initiative |publisher=Cgdev.org |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref>

In 2008, CGD produced a compilation of essays edited by [[Nancy Birdsall]] called "The White House and the World: A Global Development Agenda for the Next U.S. President". These essays give policy recommendations to solve international problems, such as global health, foreign aid policy, migration, global warming and foreign direct investment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/16560/ |title=The White House and the World: A Global Development Agenda for the Next U.S. President |publisher=Cgdev.org |date=August 22, 2008 |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref>

CGD recently published a report on the dangers of drug resistance in “The Race against Drug Resistance: When Medicines Fail”, which the Global Health team launched on June 14, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1424207/ |title=The Race against Drug Resistance: When Medicines Fail |publisher=Cgdev.org |date=June 14, 2010 |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref>

The Center's Migration and Development Initiative aims to study the effects labor movement has not only on the receiving country, but also on the country of origin and the migrants themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cgdev.org/topics/migration | title=Migration &#124; Center for Global Development |publisher=Cgdev.org |accessdate=March 22, 2017}}</ref> CGD economists [[Michael Clemens]] and [[Lant Pritchett]] have repeatedly called for a development agenda that incorporates migration from low and middle-income to high-income countries, where wages for the same task can be up to ten times higher. However, they argue that the misperception that development is about places rather than people often leads policymakers as well as economists to ignore the large benefits to the migrants themselves. Rich countries' immigration policies are also a factor in the [[Commitment to Development Index]]. CGD has advocated for temporary visas for Haitians to seasonally work in US agriculture and participated in an initiative to that end.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cgdev.org/initiative/migration-tool-disaster-recovery |title=Migration as a Tool for Disaster Recovery | accessdate=March 22, 2017}}</ref> In 2016, they issued a report on how policymakers can manage migration between the United States and Mexico to the benefit of both countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cgdev.org/publication/sharedfuture |title=Shared Border, Shared Future: A Blueprint to Regulate US-Mexico Labor Mobility | accessdate=March 22, 2017}}</ref>

In addition to print publications,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/section/publications/ |title=References |publisher=Cgdev.org |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref> CGD maintains several blogs, including [https://web.archive.org/web/20090723064619/http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/ Views From the Center] and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060421201710/http://blogs.cgdev.org/globalhealth/ Global Health Policy blog].

Other research topics listed on their website include [[capital flows]]/[[financial crises]], [[debt relief]], [[environmental issues]], economic growth, [[governance]]/democracy, [[international financial institutions]], finance, food and agriculture, [[Economic inequality|inequality]], population, poverty, private investment, security and development, and data sets and resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/section/topics/ |title=List of CGD Topics |publisher=Cgdev.org |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref>

==Funding==
CGD receives funding from foundations, governments, individuals, and corporations. The organization publishes information on its website for all grants and donations received that are above $100,000. CGD received the highest rating (five
stars) from Transparify for its open disclosure of funding in 2014 and 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transparify.org/5-star/|work=Transparify.org|title=Transparify|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref> In 2013, the government of [[Norway]] gave CGD $5 million to support its work on tropical forests and development. That support was cited in a New York Times article about think tank funding.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/foreign-powers-buy-influence-at-think-tanks.html |title=Foreign Powers Buy Influence at Think Tanks |last1=LIPTON |first1=ERIC |last2=WILLIAMS |first2=BROOKE |date=September 6, 2014 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=September 7, 2014}}</ref>

==Initiatives==
The Center considers itself a “think and do” tank, and thus has multiple initiatives to implement their policy suggestions. These, initiatives attempt to give specific policy recommendations to organizations while creating a dialogue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/ |title=List of CGD Initiatives |publisher=Cgdev.org |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref>

[[Image:CDI 2009 postcard.png|thumb|alt=2009 [[Commitment to Development Index]]|2009 [[Commitment to Development Index]].]] 
In 2003, David Roodman created the [[Commitment to Development Index]] with [[Foreign Policy (magazine)|''Foreign Policy'' magazine]] and Mapping Worlds. The Commitment to Development Index (CDI)<ref name="Commitment to Development Index"/> ranks and analyzes nations’ financial and political commitments to development every year. The index uses interactive graphs and analyzes how countries contribute to development in seven policy areas: aid (both quantity as a share of income and quality), trade, investment, migration, environment, security, and technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/cdi/inside/ |title=Inside the Commitment to Development Index |publisher=Cgdev.org |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref>
