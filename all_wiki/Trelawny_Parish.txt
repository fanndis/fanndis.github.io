'''Trelawny''' ([[Jamaican Patois]]: ''Trilaani'' or ''Chrilaani'') is a [[Parishes of Jamaica|parish]] in the county of [[Cornwall County, Jamaica|Cornwall]] in northwest [[Jamaica]]. Its capital is [[Falmouth, Jamaica|Falmouth]]. It is bordered by the parishes of [[Saint Ann Parish|Saint Ann]] in the east, [[Saint James Parish, Jamaica|Saint James]] in the west, and [[Saint Elizabeth Parish|Saint Elizabeth]] and [[Manchester Parish|Manchester]] in the south. Trelawny is known for producing several Olympic sprinters.

==History==
In 1770, the wealthy [[Planter (plantation owner)|planter]]s in [[Saint James Parish, Jamaica|St James]] and [[Saint Ann Parish|St Ann]] succeeded in having sections of those parishes become the parish of Trelawny as they were too far from [[public administration|administrative]] centres. Trelawny was named after [[Sir William Trelawny, 6th Baronet]], the then [[Governor of Jamaica]], whose prominent family had originated at the [[manor]] of [[Trelawny, Pelynt|Trelawny]] in the parish of [[Pelynt]] in Cornwall, England. The first [[Capital city|capital]] was Martha Brae, located {{convert|3|km|mi}} inland from Rock Bay.

Trelawny is best known for its [[Sugar cane|sugar]] [[Estate (land)|estates]] and [[sugar cane mill]]s. It had more [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar estates]] than any other parish, so there was need for a [[coast|sea coast]] [[town]] to [[export]] it. Falmouth became a thriving [[Port|seaport]] and social centre. The town had two of its own [[newspapers]]; ''The Falmouth Post'' and ''The Falmouth Gazette''.

Trelawny was also home to the largest group of [[Jamaican Maroons]]. A 1739 [[treaty]] between the Maroons and the English gave the Maroons [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[Real property|land]], which effectively put a stop to their [[Raid (military)|raid]]s on the plantations. However, [[Second Maroon War|a second Maroon uprising in 1795]] led to [[Jamaican Maroons in Sierra Leone|about 600 Maroons being exiled]] to [[Nova Scotia, Canada]], and later to [[Sierra Leone]] in Africa, in 1800.

In 2007, the opening ceremony for the ICC [[Cricket World Cup]] was held in Trelawny Parish.

==Geography==
Trelawny is located at [[latitude]] 18°15'N, [[longitude]] 77°46'W. It has an area of 874&nbsp;km², making it the fifth largest parish on the island. It has a [[population]] of 75,558 as of 2012.<ref name=population /> Most of the parish is flat, with wide [[plain]]s such as Queen of Spain's Valley, {{convert|750|ft|m|disp=flip}} above [[sea level]], and Windsor, {{convert|580|ft|m|disp=flip}} above sea level. Most of southern Trelawny is around {{convert|750|ft|m|disp=flip}} above sea level. The highest point in the parish is Mount Ayr which is {{convert|3000|ft|m|disp=flip}} above sea level.

The southern section of Trelawny is part of the [[Cockpit Country]], and is uninhabitable. It is therefore a natural reserve for [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]]; most of Jamaica's 27 endemic [[bird]] [[species]] can be found there, along with yellow [[snakes]], and the giant [[swallowtail butterfly]], the largest butterfly in the [[western hemisphere]].

Most of the parish has the typical limestone features of [[sinkholes]], [[cave]]s, and underground passages. There are about 48 caves, most with phosphate gatherings. These include the Windsor Cave and Carambi Cave (known for its beauty and [[phosphate]] deposits). There are several other caves which have [[Taíno people|Taino]] [[Petroglyph|carving]]s on the walls. There are also several underground [[Waterway|conduits]], with the longest running for {{convert|15|mi|km|disp=flip}}. The main [[river]]s are the Martha Brae, Rio Bueno, Cane and Quashie Rivers.

==Commerce==
Trelawny's sources of employment are based on [[agriculture]], [[Factory|manufacturing]], and [[tourism]]. [[Rum]] and [[sugar]] are Trelawny's principal products. Other crops include [[banana]]s, [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[strawberries]], [[vegetables]], [[pimento]], [[coffee]], [[ginger]], papaya and [[coconut]]. Though the fishing industry is declining, Trelawny still produces a large amount of [[fish]]. There are ten beaches along the coast, with more than 30 boats each, as well as 27 fish ponds.

There are 25 factories in the parish. These produce [[sugar]], [[rum]], and apparel, among other things. Two of the eight remaining sugar factories in Jamaica are in Trelawny &mdash;Hampden Sugar Factory, and Trelawny Sugar, formerly Long Pond Sugar Factory.

==Notable citizens==
Trelawny Parish is the birthplace of several [[track and field]] athletes:  [[Usain Bolt]], [[Veronica Campbell-Brown]], [[Marvin Anderson]], [[Ricardo Chambers]], [[Omar Brown (sprinter)|Omar Brown]], [[Michael Frater]], [[Lerone Clarke]], [[Dane Hyatt]], [[Rosemarie Whyte]], [[Michael Green (sprinter)|Michael Greene]], [[Inez Turner]], [[Debbie-Ann Parris]], [[Sanya Richards]], [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]] and [[Warren Weir]].

The [[supercentenarian]] [[Violet Brown]] (1900–2017), who was at a time the oldest verified living person in the world, was born and resided in Trelawny.

It is also the birthplace of 2008 USA Today High School Basketball Player of the Year [[Samardo Samuels]], previously of the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. Other notable citizens include [[DJ]] [[Kamau Preston]], [[dancehall]] artist [[Charly Black]], [[Rex Nettleford|basketballer Milo Channing, Rex Nettleford]], [[University of Connecticut]] basketball player [[Kentan Facey]], and star safety for the Green Bay Packers and Maurice Haughton, [[Atari Bigby]].
