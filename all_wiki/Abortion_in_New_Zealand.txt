{{anchor|Legislation}}
Abortion in New Zealand is regulated by four laws: the [[Abortion Legislation Act 2020]], the [[Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977]] (CS&A Act 1977), the [[Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003]], and Section 38 of the [[Care of Child Act 2004]]. A woman who is not more than 20 weeks pregnant may seek abortion from a health practitioner. A woman seeking an abortion past 20 weeks must obtain approval from a health practitioner, who decides whether the procedure is "clinically appropriate" and consults with at least one other qualified practitioner.<ref name="Sections 10-11">{{cite web |title=Abortion Legislation Bill Sections 10–11 |url=http://legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2019/0164/latest/LMS237600.html |website=Legislation New Zealand |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="HPCA Act 2003">{{cite web |title=Section 174 of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0048/latest/DLM205007.html?search=sw_096be8ed8191cd9a_conscientious+objection_25_se&p=1&sr=2 |website=Legislation New Zealand |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="Care of Child Act 2004">{{cite web |title=Section 38 of Care of Child Act 2004 |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2004/0090/67.0/DLM317472.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=3 October 2019}}</ref> Prior to 24 March 2020, women in New Zealand could only seek an abortion after consulting two health practitioners.<ref name="Law Around Abortion">{{cite web |title=The Law Around Abortion |url=https://www.familyplanning.org.nz/advice/abortion/the-law-around-abortion |publisher=New Zealand Family Planning |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=11–12}}

===Abortion Legislation Act 2020===
The Abortion Legislation Act 2020 amends two existing laws: the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977 and the Crimes Act 1961. While the Abortion Legislation Act's initially introduced safe zones around abortion providers, it was eliminated from the final version of the law.<ref name="Sections 10-46 replaced">{{cite web |title=Sections 10 to 46 replaced |url=http://legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2019/0164/latest/LMS237600.html |website=Legislation New Zealand |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]]  |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>

*'''[[Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977]]''': It replaces Sections 10 to 46 of the CS&A Act 1977 with Sections 10–14 and Sections 19–21. The amended bill also abolishes the Abortion Supervisory Committee, the former regulatory body that reported to Parliament, and gives its former responsibilities to the [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]] and the [[Director-General of Health]].<ref name="Sections 10-46 replaced" />
**Section 10: A qualified health practitioner may provide abortion services to a woman who is not more than 20 weeks pregnant.
**Section 11: After 20 weeks, a health practitioner can only provide abortion services to a woman if it is deemed clinically appropriate and if they consult at least one other qualified practitioner.
**Section 13: A health practitioner must advise a woman of the availability of counselling services if the woman seeks advice on whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy; advises the health practitioner of her intention to terminate the pregnancy; or has terminated pregnancy. 
**Section 14: A health practitioner cannot coerce a woman into seeking counselling as a condition for procuring an abortion.
**Section 19: A health practitioner with a [[conscientious objection to abortion]] must inform the patient and provide them with information on accessing alternative abortion providers.
**Section 20: Employer providing certain services must accommodate conscientious objection of applicant or employee unless it would cause unreasonable disruption. Abortion is regulated by the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]] and the Director-General of Health, which oversee the collection and publication of information relating to abortion services and providers. Section 20F states that the [[New Zealand Parliament]] opposes abortion for the sole purpose of sex-selection, but does not prohibit the practice. 
**Section 21: The [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] has the authority to direct the Director-General of Health to collection information relating to the regulation of abortion services stated in Section 20.
*'''[[Crimes Act 1961]]''': Abortion is eliminated from the Crimes Act. The Abortion Legislation Act replaces Sections 182A to 187A with Section 183, which states that abortion is only an offense if a person who is not a health practitioner procures or performs an abortion on a woman. The woman is not guilty of the offense.<ref name="Sections 182-187">{{cite web |title=Sections 182A to 187A replaced |url=http://legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2019/0164/latest/LMS237615.html |website=Legislation New Zealand |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>

==History==
===19th century and early 20th century===
English law, applied in New Zealand in 1840, outlawed abortion. In 1867, the [[New Zealand Parliament]] made it an offence to cause a miscarriage. Under the law, abortionists were considered criminals while the woman seeking an abortion was considered an accomplice to the crime. If a woman induced her own abortion, she was considered a criminal under the law. Therapeutic abortions were available under limited circumstances such as when the mother's life or mental health was in serious danger. During the late 1930s, this right was extended by a court judgment. However, abortion was still strongly frowned upon by society with many doctors refusing to perform terminations.<ref name="Te Ara Page 1">{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Megan |title='Abortion – Illegal but possible: 1840 to 1950s |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/abortion/page-1 |website=[[Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=29 September 2019 |date=8 November 2018}}</ref>

In 1936 the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand]] set up a committee, led by [[Gervan McMillan|D.G. McMillan]], to inquire about the incidence of [[septic abortion]] in New Zealand. The report estimated that at least 13 in every 100 pregnancies ended in criminal abortion, that number having increased over the five years prior. In the same time period, while maternal deaths had dropped, the number of deaths due to septic abortions had increased, accounting for two-fifths of total maternal mortality. Based on evidence heard before the committee, it was found that a major reason for abortions was a change in social outlook, "particularly towards the rearing of large families" and "an attitude of pitying superiority towards the woman with many children." Other reasons included lack of suitable housing in cities, lack of help for women in performing domestic labour, and the widespread use of ineffective methods of [[contraception]].<ref name=mcmillan>{{cite book |last1=McMillan |first1=D.G. |title=Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Various Aspects of the Problem of Abortion in New Zealand |date=1937 |publisher=Government Printer |location=[[Wellington, New Zealand]] |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/ahkitj/section27/#abortion-1937%20facsimile%20scan |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=145–147}}<ref name="Te Ara Page 1" />

In the 1930s, [[Isabel Annie Aves]] was tried four times for "unlawfully using an instrument with intent to procure a miscarriage" without conviction.<ref name="DNZB Aves">{{DNZB|title=Isabel Annie Aves|first= Barbara|last= Brookes|id=4a25|accessdate=8 October 2016}}</ref> In the 1940s, activists such as [[Alice Bush]] advocated for access to doctor-provided abortions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hercock |first1=Faye |title=Alice: The Making of A Woman Doctor: 1914–1974 |date=1999 |publisher=[[Auckland University Press]] |location=[[Auckland]] |isbn=1-86940-206-5}}</ref>

===Changing attitudes, 1960s–1970s===
Following the [[Second World War]], the [[Sexual Revolution]] during the 1960s led a change in societal attitudes towards matters of sex, birth control, and motherhood including abortion. These also gave rise to the emergence of [[Second-wave feminism]] and the [[Women's liberation movement]] during the 1960s and 1970s.  Between 1965 and 1970, the number of abortions performed in public hospitals jumped from 70 in 1965 to more than 300 by 1970. Public debate increased following the [[Abortion in the United Kingdom|legalisation of abortion]] in Britain in 1967, and court decisions in Australia in 1967 and 1970 legalising abortion. The legalisation of [[abortion in Australia]] enabled New Zealand women who could afford to travel there to have abortions in [[Australia]].<ref name="Te Ara Page 3">{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Megan |title=Opposition and support from the 1960s |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/abortion/page-3 |website=[[Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=29 September 2019 |date=8 November 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=21–23, 70–71, 76–77}}

Growing public awareness and debate about abortion led to the emergence of rival [[Anti-abortion movement|anti-abortion]] and [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion rights]] groups. Early anti-abortion groups included the [[Voice for Life|Society for the Protection of the Unborn Children]] (SPUC) and REPEAL while early abortion rights groups included the [[Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand]] (ALRANZ) and the more militant Women's National Abortion Action Campaign (WONAAC).<ref name="Te Ara Page 3" /> According to McCulloch, several [[Communist League (New Zealand)|Socialist Action League]] members including Kay Goodger were involved in the formation of WONAAC.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=42–44, 49–52}}

During the 1970s, the [[Catholic Church in New Zealand|Catholic Church]], conservative [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, and the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in New Zealand|Mormons]] opposed abortion. By contrast, the [[Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia|Anglican]], [[Baptist Churches of New Zealand|Baptist]], [[Methodist Church of New Zealand|Methodist]], and [[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand|Presbyterian]] denominations took a more liberal stance; which generated controversy among their members.<ref name="Te Ara Page 3" />{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=54–69}} In addition, abortion attracted bipartisan support from some members of the [[New Zealand Parliament]] including [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] MPs [[Mary Batchelor]] and [[Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan]], and [[New Zealand National Party|National]] MPs [[George Gair]] and [[Marilyn Waring]].<ref name="Te Ara Page 3" />

The first abortion clinic in New Zealand was the Auckland Medical Aid Centre (AMAC), which opened in 1974 and introduced the practice of [[vacuum aspiration]] to New Zealand. By the end of its first year, it had provided 2,288 women with abortions. By 1975, this figure had risen to 4,005. AMAC attracted opposition from anti-abortion activists including arson attacks. The [[New Zealand Police]] also raided AMAC in 1974, leading to the prosecution and acquittal of one of its doctors, Jim Woolnough.<ref name="Te Ara Page 4">{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Megan |title=Controversy: 1974 to 1980s |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/abortion/page-4 |website=[[Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=29 September 2019 |date=8 November 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=77–82}}{{sfn|Pryor|1986|pp=11, 49–58}}

===Decriminalising abortion, 1977–1978===
In response to AMAC, the New Zealand Parliament passed Labour MP and SPUC member's [[Gerard Wall]]'s Hospitals Amendment Act 1975 which limited the provision of abortion services to licensed hospitals. While AMAC was forced to close, it later reopened in 1980 after buying a private hospital. The Hospitals Amendment Act was later invalidated on technical grounds. In response to the closure of AMAC, abortion rights activists established the [[Sisters Overseas Service]] (SOS), which helped women travel to Australia for abortion operations in 1978 and 1979. McCulloch estimates that SOS chapters across New Zealand including Auckland and Wellington sent between 4,000 and 4,500 women to Australia for abortion operations during that period.<ref name="Te Ara Page 4" />{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=83–84, 186–189}} [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] MP [[Frank Gill (politician)|Frank Gill]] later tried to entrench Wall's bill through the Health Amendment Bill 1976 but pro-abortion rights Labour MP [[George Gair]] managed to pass an amendment deferring it by twelve months.{{sfn|Pryor|2013|pp=72–74}}

In response to growing public debate around abortion, Parliament set up a [[Royal Commission on Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion]] to consider public policy on these issues. At the Commission's recommendations, the [[Third National Government of New Zealand|Third National Government]] passed the [[Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977]] (CS&A Act 1977) on 15 December 1978, which established the legal framework for abortion in New Zealand. Under the CS&A Act, a woman seeking abortion had to see their doctor and the two medical consultants, who would assess the mental and physical grounds for carrying out an abortion. A surgeon would also be needed to perform an abortion. Counselling was also made available to women seeking an abortion. The CS&A Act also established an Abortion Supervisory Committee to regulate the certifying consultants responsible for permitting abortions. The Act also required [[district health board]]s to fund abortions. During the late 1970s and 1980s, several public and private abortion clinics were opened in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.<ref name="Te Ara Page 4" />{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=180–182}}{{sfn|Pryor|2013|pp=71–108}}

The CS&A Act was criticized by the feminist group Campaign to Oppose Repressive Abortion Laws (CORAL) and WONAAC as being too restrictive and infringing on women's reproductive rights.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=177–180}} In 1977, the Government also amended the [[Crimes Act 1961]] to allow abortion within the 20 weeks gestation period. After 20 weeks, abortion was permitted on the grounds of saving the mother's life and preventing serious permanent injury to her mental and physical health. In 1978, the Government further amended the Crimes Act to permit abortion on the grounds of saving the mother's life, mental health, and physical health; foetal abnormality within the 20 weeks gestation period; and incest or sexual intercourse with guardians and family members. In 1986, the Crimes Act was further amended to take into account factors like the extremes of age and sexual violation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 187 of Crimes Act 1961 |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329364.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref><ref name="Law Around Abortion" />

===Post decriminalisation, 1977–1990s===
Following the decriminalisation of abortion, ALRANZ lobbied several hospital boards into establishing more abortion clinics and services. In November 1978, Epsom Day clinic opened in Auckland in November 1978. This was followed by the establishment of Wellington's Parkview Clinic in July 1980 and Christchurch's Lyndhurst Hospital in January 1986. Together with AMAC, these three clinics have provided the vast majority of abortions in New Zealand. ALRANZ and other abortion rights groups shifted their attention to lobbying for [[sex education]] in schools and easing young people's access to [[contraceptive]]s.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=200, 247}}<ref name="Te Ara Page 4" /> In response, anti-abortion activists and groups picketed abortion clinics and joined forces with socially-conservative moral groups including Moral Rearmament, Family Rights Association, Society for the Protection of Community Standards (SPCS), and "Family 75" during the late 1970s and 1980s.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=247, 200–208}}

SPUC was at the forefront of opposing abortion during the 1980s. In 1980, SPUC secured the removal of two members of the Abortion Supervisory Committee on the grounds that they had been promoting abortion by encouraging hospital boards to establish abortion services. That same year, two SPUC–backed candidates were elected to the Wellington hospital board. In 1981, the president of SPUC's [[Dunedin]] branch, John O'Neill sought injunctions on behalf of men who wanted to stop their lovers or partners from having abortions. In three of these cases, the women involved managed to obtain their abortions before the courts could intervene. When a judge imposed an interim injunction against an abortion an hour after it had taken place, WONAAC and Alranz staged a protest outside the Court of Appeal in Wellington to protest the judge's action. In 1982, SPUC also unsuccessfully lobbied for all fetuses to be officially registered in the national Registrar of Births, Deaths, and Marriages.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=240–214, 238}}

In 1982, a [[New Plymouth]] pediatrician Melvyn Wall sought a judicial review of a decision by two certifying consultants to allow an abortion for a fifteen-year-old girl, alleging that they had acted in "bad faith." Wall's motion was dismissed on the grounds that he had no right to mount the challenge and that decisions by certifying consultants were deemed not open to review. While SPUC's President Marilyn Pryor regarded Wall v. Livingston as a major loss for anti-abortion advocates, ALRANZ welcomed the ruling for upholding women's access to abortion services. WONAAC also successfully appealed to the Medical Practitioners' Disciplinary Committee for Wall to be censured on the grounds that he had violated patient confidentiality. Wall was also fined NZ$1,500. While Wall had the censure revoked, the Medical Council found him liable for professional misconduct and added $500 in costs to the original amount.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=238–239}}

In 1983, [[New Zealand National Party|National]] Member of Parliament [[Doug Kidd]], with the support of SPUC, introduced a private member's bill called the [[Status of the Unborn Child Bill]]. In response, the feminist National Member of Parliament [[Marilyn Waring]] introduced the pro-abortion rights Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion Repeal Bill to challenge Kidd's bill. Waring also leaked news about Kidd's affair with a parliamentary secretary to WONAAC. Ultimately, both Kidd and Waring's bills were defeated and no changes were made to existing abortion legislation. While Pryor blamed the Status of the Unborn Child Bill's hasty introduction for its defeat, abortion rights journalist Alison McCulloch has attributed the bill's defeat to both Waring's counter-bill and Kidd's affair.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=229–231}}

In 1987, O'Neill of SPUC appeared before the [[New Zealand Parliament]]'s Justice and Law Reform Committee and demanded the dismissal of the Abortion Supervisory Committee (including the two SPUC–backed members) on the grounds they had failed to carry out their functions. That same year, Leo Buchanan, the medical superintendent of [[Masterton]] hospital refused to apply for a renewal of the hospital's license to provide abortion services, citing his [[conscientious objection to abortion]]. Buchanan's actions effectively ended abortion services in the [[Wairarapa]] region. In 1991, O'Neill challenged the validity of abortion licenses throughout New Zealand, leading to the temporary suspension of abortion operations in Dunedin and [[Waikato]] for several days. The Otago Health Board's abortion license was suspended on the grounds of a legal technicality connected with the change from the Hospitals Act 1975 to the Area Health Boards Act.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=240–241}}

During the late 1980s, WONAAC unsuccessfully lobbied several feminist MPs including [[Sonja Davies]] and the [[Minister of Women's Affairs]] [[Margaret Shields]] for a more liberal abortion law in the form of a private member's bill. However, the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] thought there was insufficient support for further abortion reform and instead passed the Contraceptive, Sterilisation and Abortion Amendment Act 1990, which eliminated the restriction on who could educate and provide services and supplies. The–then [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Health Minister]] and future Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] sponsored the CS&A Amendment Act.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=257–260}}<ref>{{cite web |title=No change since 1977 – The Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion Act |url=https://www.familyplanning.org.nz/news/2017/no-change-since-1977-the-contraception-sterilisation-and-abortion-act |publisher=Family Planning New Zealand |accessdate=8 October 2019 |date=16 December 2017}}</ref>

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, an anti-abortion group called [[Operation Rescue New Zealand]] was active, modeling itself after the American-based [[Randall Terry]]'s [[Operation Save America|Operation Rescue]] organisation. Operation Rescue used aggressive clinics including picketing abortion clinics, remonstrating with abortion patients, breaking into buildings and operation theatres to disrupt operations, and distributing leaflets attacking abortion practitioners as "baby killers." Operation Rescue was also criticised for its aggressive tactics by the anti-abortion movement with Women for Live's president Anettta Moran rejecting the group's willingness to break the law. While SPUC's leadership was initially critical of Operation Rescue NZ, the leadership subsequently relented and allowed SPUC members to participate. Operation Rescue NZ had a large Catholic component including priests and clergy. According to McCulloch, an estimated half of Operation Rescue's supporters were also SPUC members. Operation Rescue's activities also attracted counter-protests from WONAAC and the Wellington-based group Choice.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=242–247}}{{sfn|Campbell|1989|pp=10–13}}

===Into the 21st century===
====Attempts at abortion law reform, 1999–2001====
In 1999, the Abortion Supervisory Committee's annual report criticised MPs for using it as a buffer between them and abortion interest groups, allowing them to abrogate their responsibilities. In response to that report, the newly–formed [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]], which was in coalition with the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance party]], made attempts to reform New Zealand's abortion laws. After several months of preparatory work, the Cabinet agreed to amend the [[Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion Act 1977]] in July 2001 to allow one doctor to approve an abortion. The Cabinet also submitted a Supplementary Order Paper exploring the grounds for abortion, possible decriminalisation, and the abolition of the Abortion Supervisory Committee. However, this plan was scuttled due to growing troubles within the Labour–Alliance coalition government.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|p=262}}

====Introducing medical abortions, 2002–2003====
Former ALRANZ president [[Margaret Sparrow]] established a non-profit company called Istar to import [[mifepristone]] (formerly known as RU 486), a pill used in [[medical abortion]]s to cause the embryo to dislodge from the uterine wall, and a prostaglandin supplement to expel the remains.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://alranz.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/emptopwhat-is-it.pdf |title=Early medication abortion: what is it? |date=2011 |publisher=Abortion Law Reform Association |accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref> In 2002, Istar convinced the Abortion Supervisory Committee to seek a Court ruling on how the CS&A Act 1977 applied to the use of mifepristone. In April 2003, [[Eddie Durie|Justice Durie]] ruled that women seeking medical abortions must take medications in a licensed facility but need not remain there between taking the two sets of tablets, which are taken 48 hours apart. Women also need not stay in the facility until the expulsion of the fetus completes the abortion.{{sfn|McCulloch|p=262}}<ref>{{cite web |title=A brief history of abortion laws in New Zealand |url=http://abortionservices.org.nz/information/history.html |website=Abortion Services in New Zealand |accessdate=3 October 2019 |date=21 November 2014}}</ref><ref name="Te Ara Chapter 5">{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Megan |title=Abortion: 1990s to 21st century |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/abortion/page-5 |website=[[Te Ara: the Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=2 October 2019 |date=8 November 2018}}</ref>

====2004 Parental notification amendment bill====
In 2004, the Fifth Labour Government passed the [[Care of Child Act 2004]] which allows a girl under the age of 16 to seek an abortion through the framework of the CS&A Act 1977.<ref name="Care of Child Act 2004" /><ref name="Law Around Abortion" />{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=11–12}} That same year, National Party MP [[Judith Collins]], with the support of anti-abortion lobby group [[Voice for Life]] (formerly SPUC), proposed an amendment to that law requiring anyone under 16 years of age to [[parental notification|notify]] their parents before having an abortion.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McCurdy |first1=Diana |title=Collins at centre of abortion storm |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3592370 |accessdate=6 August 2019 |newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=19 September 2004}}</ref><ref name="Stuff 22 May 2011">{{cite news |last1=Vance |first1=Andrea |title=Judith Collins backs action on secret teen abortions |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/5037189/Judith-Collins-backs-action-on-secret-teen-abortions |accessdate=6 August 2019 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=22 May 2011}}</ref> Collins was opposed by ALRANZ,<ref>{{cite news |title=Abortion Law Reform Org & Judith Collins' New Plan |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0410/S00215/abortion-law-reform-org-judith-collins-new-plan.htm |accessdate=6 August 2019 |work=[[Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand]] |publisher=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]] |date=22 October 2004}}</ref> the New Zealand Medical Association and New Zealand College of General Practitioners.<ref name="Stuff 22 May 2011" />

====2008 informed consent amendment bill====
During the [[48th New Zealand Parliament]], former [[The Kiwi Party|Kiwi Party]] list MP [[Gordon Copeland]] had a private members bill, the Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion (Informed Consent) Amendment Bill, drawn from the ballot. It was based on an Australian Capital Territory 'informed consent' piece of legislation, since repealed, and was defeated on a voice vote in Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/Speeches/6/3/6/48HansS_20080409_00000961-Copeland-Gordon-General-Debate.htm |title=Copeland, Gordon: General Debate|date=9 April 2008|work=Hansard Volume:646 Page:15509|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> Copeland has since been voted out of Parliament, as he did not secure a constituency seat at the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|New Zealand general election held in 2008]] and his Kiwi Party polled well under the five percent threshold under the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] framework in the Electoral Act 1993.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McLeod |first1=Peter |title=Gordon Copeland: A life of achievement, driven by faith |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/109292743/gordon-copeland-a-life-of-achievement-driven-by-faith |accessdate=6 August 2019 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=15 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Gordon Copeland, former MP dies |url=https://cathnews.co.nz/2018/11/29/gordon-copeland-dies/ |accessdate=6 August 2019 |publisher=CathNews New Zealand |date=29 November 2018}}</ref>

====Chadwick's proposed amendment, 2010====
In July 2010, Labour MP [[Steve Chadwick]] proposed an Abortion Reform Bill to take abortion out of the Crimes Act 1961. The anti-abortion organisation Voice for Life opposed the Bill while ALRANZ supported it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10656210|title=MP's bill aims for abortion on demand|last=Johnstone|first=Martin|date=3 July 2010|work=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref> Due to fierce opposition from anti-abortion opponents and a lack of sufficient parliamentary support, Chadwick was unable to get the numbers to put her Bill into ballot. Even the progressive [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]] declined to issue a public statement supporting Chadwick's bill. After Chadwick lost her seat in Parliament in the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 general election]], she lamented the weakened state of the abortion rights movement in New Zealand and opined that change was only possible if the [[New Zealand Law Commission]] produced recommendations that any government would touch upon.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=262–263, 273–274}}

====Challenges to abortion, 2009–2012====
In 2009, the anti-abortion group [[Right to Life New Zealand]] launched a court case against the Abortion Supervisory Committee, accusing it of not sufficiently regulating abortion by allowing broad interpretation of the mental health exception. A [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] decision supported some of Right to Life New Zealand's points, finding that there was de facto abortion on demand. However, the Abortion Supervisory Committee appealed this to the [[New Zealand Court of Appeal]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Right to Life wins ruling in court |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/5936/Right-to-Life-wins-ruling-in-court |accessdate=28 September 2019 |work=[[The Press (Christchurch)|The Press]] |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=31 January 2009}}</ref>

On 1 June 2011 the Court of Appeal overturned the earlier High Court verdict favoring Right to Life, finding that there was no statutory reference to embryos and fetuses within New Zealand law, and therefore no grounds for further attempted interference with existing abortion access procedures. It did not, however, overturn the finding that there was de facto abortion on demand in New Zealand.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/front-page/cases/abortion-supervisory-committee-v-right-to-life-new-zealand-inc |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109073912/http://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/front-page/cases/abortion-supervisory-committee-v-right-to-life-new-zealand-inc |archive-date=9 January 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In March 2012, Right to Life appealed to the [[New Zealand Supreme Court]], which dismissed their appeal by a 3–2 majority in August 2012.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Right to Life v The Abortion Supervisory Committee |vol= SC 73/2011|reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=[[Supreme Court of New Zealand]] |date=9 August 2012 |url=https://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/cases/right-to-life-new-zealand-inc-v-the-abortion-supervisory-committee/at_download/fileDecision |accessdate=6 August 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10825886 |title=Abortion cases not open for review, Supreme Court judges rule |last1=Backhouse |first1=Matthew |date=10 August 2012 |website=NZHerald }}</ref>

On 7 April 2011, during the term of the [[49th New Zealand Parliament]], [[Māori Party]] co-leader [[Tariana Turia]] moved that an anti-abortion Pacific Island doctor, Ate Moala, be appointed to the Abortion Supervisory Committee.

====Renewed abortion reform efforts, 2018====
During the 2010s, a wave of international abortion reform law changes led to a renewed campaign by New Zealand abortion rights advocates to decriminalise abortion.  ALRANZ and other abortion rights groups argued that abortion was a health and reproductive rights issue that should be removed from the Crimes Act.  In 2018, ALRANZ and a group of women who had had abortions filed a case with the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]] challenging the existing abortion legal framework in New Zealand.<ref name="Te Ara Chapter 5" />

In late February 2018, the [[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|Minister of Justice]] [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] sought advice from the [[New Zealand Law Commission]] on realigning the country's abortion legal framework towards a health approach. The Law Commission also received 3,419 public submissions on abortion law reform between 4 April and 18 May 2018. In late October 2018, the Law Commission proposed three options: having no statutory test to make sure the abortion was appropriate at any point; taking abortion off the Crimes Act but having a statutory test; or only having a test for later-term abortions, after 22 weeks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alternative approaches to abortion law |url=https://www.lawcom.govt.nz/abortion |publisher=[[New Zealand Law Commission]] |accessdate=13 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903154810/https://www.lawcom.govt.nz/abortion|archive-date=3 September 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Andrew Little 2018 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|The Abortion Legislation Bill was introduced to Parliament in 2019 by Justice Minister [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]].]]
On 5 August 2019, the Justice Minister Andrew Little announced that the Government would be introducing [[Abortion Legislation Act 2020|new legislation]] giving women access to abortion for the first 20 weeks of pregnancy without having to navigate legal loopholes and removing abortion from the [[Crimes Act 1961]]. However [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Jacinda Ardern]] has said it is not a government bill.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/08/jacinda-ardern-believes-large-number-of-people-will-support-abortion-law-reform.html|title=Jacinda Ardern believes 'large number of people' will support abortion law reform|date=2019-08-08|work=Newshub|access-date=2019-09-20|language=en}}</ref>

Other changes include allowing women to self-refer to an abortion service, ensuring that health practitioners advise women about counselling services, establishing safe areas around abortion facilities, and ensuring that conscientious objecting doctors inform women about their stance and alternative services. The Government adopted the Law Commission's third approach for a test on later-term abortions but reduced the time-frame to 20 weeks. The test for late term abortions is contained in section 11 of the proposed bill. Section 11 states that "a qualified health practitioner may provide abortion services to a woman who is more than 20 weeks pregnant only if the health practitioner reasonably believes that the abortion is appropriate in the circumstances..."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2019/0164/latest/LMS237600.html|title=Abortion Legislation Bill 164-1 (2019), Government Bill 7 Sections 10 to 46 replaced – New Zealand Legislation|website=Legislation New Zealand|publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]]|access-date=20 September 2019}}</ref>

Labour and its coalition partner [[New Zealand First]] engaged in several months of negotiations discussing the legislation. The Minister for Children and New Zealand First MP [[Tracey Martin]] reportedly played an important part in these negotiations. Despite initially ruling out a referendum, NZ First leader Winston Peters subsequently demanded a binding referendum on abortion reform. In response, Opposition [[New Zealand National Party|National]] MP [[Amy Adams (politician)|Amy Adams]] criticized NZ First's U-turn, saying that the matter should be decided by Parliament. National Party leader [[Simon Bridges]] has indicated that he would support a Select Committee examining the bill.

The first major [[Anti-abortion movement|anti-abortion]] group in New Zealand was the Society for the Protection of the Unborn (SPUC), which was led by Marilyn Pryor. SPUC drew support from the Catholic Church in New Zealand and politicians from the two major parties, Labour and National. By 1975, SPUC had 28 branches and 40,000 members. Policy differences between the national leadership and the Christchurch branch led by Ken Orr led to SPUC's splintering in 2000. The Christchurch branch revamped itself as [[Right to Life New Zealand]] in September 2000 while the national organisation rebranded itself as [[Voice for Life]] in 2004.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=54–56, 74}}<ref name="Te Ara Chapter 5" />

Other anti-abortion groups have included Family Life International,<ref>{{cite web |title=About FLI |url=https://fli.org.nz/about_fli/ |publisher=Family Life International NZ |accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref> [[Family First New Zealand]],<ref>{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://www.familyfirst.org.nz/about-us/ |publisher=[[Family First New Zealand]] |accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref> the youth-based organisation ProLife NZ,<ref>{{cite web |title=About ProLife NZ |url=https://prolife.org.nz/about-us/|publisher=ProLife NZ |accessdate=2 October 2019}}</ref> [[Focus on the Family]] New Zealand.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|p=273}} Some of these anti-abortion groups had international connections and also took an interest in other issues including [[euthanasia]] and [[in vitro fertilisation]]. These anti-abortion groups were often well-funded.<ref name="Te Ara Chapter 5" /> According to McCulloch, Right to Life had an annual income of NZ$25,000 to NZ$35,000 a year during the mid–to–late 2000s; spending NZ$80,000 on its legal challenge against the Abortion Supervisory Committee by May 2009.  Some former anti-abortion groups have included [[Operation Rescue New Zealand]], Women for Life, and the [[Kiwi Party]]. In 2013, McCulloch has estimated that the anti-abortion movement in New Zealand had tens of thousands of members.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=203–207, 242–247, 263–264, 273}}

Anti-abortion activism have included picketing abortion clinics and hospitals, targeting doctors and members of the Abortion Supervisory Committee, public booths, newspaper advertisements, distributing informational material, lobbying politicians, letters to the editor, and protests.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|p=261}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Who We Are |url=http://voiceforlife.org.nz/who-we-are/ |publisher=[[Voice for Life]] |accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref><ref name="Back to the Barricades" /> Operation Rescue NZ drew controversy for its aggressive methods which included invading abortion clinics and operating theatres and sending death threats to abortion practitioners.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=242–247}}{{sfn|Campbell|1989|pp=10–13}} Anti-abortion groups have also pursued a "Stop Family Planning" campaign reminiscent of similar efforts in the United States against [[Planned Parenthood]]. In 2009, former Prolife New Zealand leader Andy Moore created a spoof website using the domain name "alranz.org.nz"  which attacked Alranz. After "alranz.org.nz" was shut down by a successful complaint, Moore created a wiki called "AbortionWiki" which targeted ALRANZ and other abortion rights supporters.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|p=261}}

In addition, violent militant elements of the anti-abortion movement have also perpetrated arson attacks and bomb threats against abortion clinics. The Auckland Medical Aid Centre experienced several arson attacks in 1976 and 1989. Lyndhurst clinic in Christchurch experienced arson attacks in May 1985 and October 1989.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=94–95, 247–248}} In 1999 Graeme White was jailed for tunneling into Lyndhurst clinic in a failed attempt to blow it up.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|p=248}}<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4162382a6530.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120912002910/http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4162382a6530.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 September 2012 |title=Search for missing swimmer called off |last=Steward |first=Ian |date=13 August 2007 |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=1 October 2008 }}</ref> Epsom Day clinic experienced an arson attack in 1985, a firebombing in April 1987, and a bomb threat in October 1989.

===Religious denominations and organisations===
====Christian====
The [[Catholic Church in New Zealand]] has remained an opponent of abortion, teaching that life begins at conception.<ref>{{cite web |author1=New Zealand Catholic Bishops Conference and the Nathaniel Centre |title=Review of the Abortion Laws in New Zealand Submission to the Law Commission – May 2018 |url=https://www.catholic.org.nz/assets/NZCBC-and-Nathaniel-Centre-Submission-to-Law-Commission-18-May-FINAL-002.pdf |website=Catholic.org.nz |accessdate=13 October 2019 |date=May 2018}}</ref> The [[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand]] has expressed concerns that the Abortion Legislation Act 2020 does not protect unborn children and could lead to sex and disability-selective abortions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Notes on abortion and on making a submission|url=https://www.presbyterian.org.nz/sites/default/files/about_us/general_assembly/Notes%20on%20abortion%20and%20on%20making%20a%20submission.pdf |publisher=[[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand]] |accessdate=13 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191013104351/https://www.presbyterian.org.nz/sites/default/files/about_us/general_assembly/Notes%20on%20abortion%20and%20on%20making%20a%20submission.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2019}}</ref>

The New Zealand Christian Network takes the view that abortion should be "safe, legal and rare" and opposed Abortion Legislation Bill on the grounds that it does not protect unborn children and would facilitate abortion on demand.<ref>{{cite web |title=NZCN is OPPOSED to the "Abortion Legislation Bill" |url=https://nzchristiannetwork.org.nz/nzcn-is-opposed-to-the-abortion-legislation-bill/ |publisher=New Zealand Christian Network |accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref> [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in New Zealand|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) opposes elective abortions for personal and social convenience but permits abortion in cases of rape, incest, protecting the life and health of the mother, and fetal deformities.

==Statistics==
Since 1978, the Abortion Supervisory Committee (ASC) has collected statistics on the numbers of terminations performed each year, and for what reason, under the terms of the [[Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977]]. In 1983, [[Statistics New Zealand]] agreed to process abortion statistics on behalf of the ASC and subsequently took over responsibility for releasing abortion–related statistics in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |title=Abortion Statisitcs |url=http://datainfoplus.stats.govt.nz/Item/nz.govt.stats/7845b64a-dc1a-427c-b9a5-89eaf7c4580b?_ga=2.70223765.402270236.1570953519-1550446268.1569731726 |publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]] |accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref> Since abortion was illegal until 1977, there are no exact figures on abortions prior to the 1970s. Megan Cook estimates that 10,000 abortions took place each year during the 1930s, based on statistics relating to the number of women admitted to hospital during that period for septic abortions.<ref name="Te Ara Page 1" />

===Historical figures===
During the 1970s and 1980s, the abortion rate per woman rose from 0.02 in 1971 to 0.30 by 1986. The number of unmarried women seeking abortions, including those in de facto relationships, also increased. During that period, women aged 24 and younger were more likely to seek abortions than older women. While [[European New Zealander]]s were more likely to have an abortion at a younger age to end an unwanted pregnancy, [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[Pacific Islander|Pacific New Zealander]]s were more likely to use abortion due to lack of access to contraception.<ref name="Te Ara Page 4" />

According to figures released by Statistics New Zealand, the number of abortions rose from 8.5 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years in 1980 to 14 per 1,000 women in 1990. By 2000, this figure had risen to 18.7 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years but has since declined to 13.5 per 1,000 women as of 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=Abortions |url=https://www.stats.govt.nz/topics/abortions |publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]] |accessdate=13 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190805114217/https://www.stats.govt.nz/topics/abortions|archive-date=13 October 2019}}</ref>

As the annual statistics for the Abortion Supervisory Committee have repeatedly said, mental health grounds are the predominant grounds for most certified abortions in New Zealand. The high numbers of abortions in New Zealand for mental health grounds have led [[anti-abortion]]ists to express concerns that the mental health exception is being used to allow abortion on demand.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Abortion Supervisory Committee Deserves Criticism|publisher=Family First Lobby|date=10 June 2008 |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0806/S00090.htm |accessdate=10 June 2008|quote=The Committee has ignored the original intention of parliament and because of their lack of supervision and inaction, this has effectively led to abortion on demand.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080611064750/http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0806/S00090.htm| archivedate= 11 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> By contrast, ALRANZ says that successive abortion-related case law has preserved the status quo of partial decriminalisation and liberal terms of abortion access for most New Zealand women who need an abortion.{{sfn|McCulloch|2013|pp=261–264}}

===2018 abortion statistics===
According to Statistics New Zealand, 13,282 induced abortions had been performed in New Zealand in 2018. There were 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years in 2018, down from 13.7 per 1,000 women in 2017. Split amongst ethnicity in 2018, the highest rates were among European women (7,567), followed by [[Māori people|Māori]] (2,979), [[Asian people|Asian]] women (2,789), and [[Pacific Islander|Pacific]] women (1,354), and MELAA ( or Middle Eastern, Latin American, and African) (215).<ref name="Stats NZ 2018">{{cite web |title=Abortion statistics: Year ended December 2018 |url=https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/abortion-statistics-year-ended-december-2018 |publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]] |accessdate=13 October 2019 |date=18 June 2019}}</ref>

In 2017, New Zealand's abortion rate of 13.7 per 1000 women aged 15–44 years was similar to the [[United States of America|United States]] (13.5), [[South Australia]] (13.2 in 2016). This is below [[England]] and [[Wales]] (17.0), [[France]] (17.2), and [[Sweden]] (19.8) but higher than [[Germany]] (7.1), [[Finland]] (9.6), [[Scotland]] (12.1), and [[Norway]] (12.5).<ref name="Stats NZ 2018" />
