The '''International Security Assistance Force''' ('''ISAF''') was a [[NATO]]-led military mission in [[Afghanistan]], established by the [[United Nations Security Council]] in December 2001 by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386|Resolution 1386]], as envisaged by the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn Agreement]].<ref>{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1386(2001) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2001 |resolution_number=1386 |accessdate=21 September 2007|date=31 May 2001}}</ref><ref name="UN_S20011154_page9">{{UN document |docid=S-2001-1154 |type=Document |body=Security Council |year=2001 |document_number=1154 |page=9 |accessdate=26 August 2008|title=Annex I – International Security Force}}</ref> Its main purpose was to train the [[Afghan National Security Forces]] (ANSF) and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding key government institutions, but was also engaged in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)]] against the [[Taliban insurgency]].

ISAF was initially charged with securing [[Kabul]] and the surrounding areas from the [[Taliban]], [[al Qaeda]] and factional warlords, to allow for the establishment of the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] headed by [[Hamid Karzai]].<ref>[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N01/708/55/PDF/N0170855.pdf?OpenElement Official Documents System of the United Nations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009004731/http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N01/708/55/PDF/N0170855.pdf?OpenElement |date=9 October 2008 }}</ref> In October 2003, the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/isaf/topics/mandate/unscr/resolution_1510.pdf |title=UNSC Resolution 1510, October 13, 2003|accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref> and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country.<ref name="ISAF Chronology">{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/isaf/topics/chronology/index.html |title=ISAF Chronology |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref> From 2006 to 2011, ISAF became increasingly involved in more intensive combat operations in southern and eastern Afghanistan.

Troop contributors included the [[United States armed forces|United States]], [[British Armed Forces|United Kingdom]], [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canada]], and other [[Member states of NATO|NATO member states]] as well as a number of other countries. The intensity of the combat faced by contributing nations varied greatly, with the United States sustaining the most casualties overall. In early 2010, there were at least 700 military bases inside Afghanistan. About 400 of these were used by American‑led NATO forces and 300 by the ANSF.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fpif.org/articles/the_700_military_bases_of_afghanistan |title=The 700 Military Bases of Afghanistan |publisher=Foreign Police in Focus (FPIF) |first=Nick |last=Turse |date=11 February 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>

ISAF ceased combat operations and was disbanded in December 2014, with some troops remaining behind in an advisory role as part of ISAF's successor organization, the [[Resolute Support Mission]].

==Jurisdiction==
[[File:Military terminal at Kabul International Airport.jpg|thumb|ISAF's military terminal at [[Kabul International Airport]] in September 2010.]]
For almost two years, the ISAF mandate did not go beyond the boundaries of Kabul. According to General [[Norbert Van Heyst]], such a deployment would require at least ten thousand additional soldiers. The responsibility for security throughout the whole of Afghanistan was to be given to the newly reconstituted [[Afghan National Army]]. However, on 13 October 2003, the Security Council voted unanimously to expand the ISAF mission beyond Kabul with Resolution 1510. Shortly thereafter, Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] said that Canadian soldiers (nearly half of the entire force at that time) would not deploy outside Kabul.

On 24 October 2003, the German [[Bundestag]] voted to send German troops to the region of [[Kunduz]]. Approximately 230 additional soldiers were deployed to that region, marking the first time that ISAF soldiers operated outside of Kabul. After the [[Afghan parliamentary election in 2005|2005 Afghan parliamentary election]], the Canadian base [[Camp Julien]] in Kabul closed, and the remaining Canadian assets were moved to [[Kandahar]] as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in preparation for a significant deployment in January, 2006. On 31 July 2006, the NATO‑led International Security Assistance Force assumed command of the south of the country, ISAF Stage 3, and by 5 October, also of the east of Afghanistan, ISAF Stage 4.

ISAF was mandated by [[UN Security Council Resolution]]s [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386|1386]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1413|1413]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1444|1444]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1510|1510]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1563|1563]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1623|1623]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1659|1659]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1707|1707]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1776|1776]],<ref>Russia abstained from UNSCR 1776 due to the lack of clarity in the wording pertaining to ISAF's maritime interception component, which has not appeared in any of the Security Council's previous resolutions.{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5744 |body=Security Council |type=Verbotim Report |meeting=5744 |page=2 |anchor=pg002-bk08 |date=19 September 2007 |meetingtime=17:20 |speakername=Mr. Churkin | speakernation=Russia |accessdate=21 September 2007 }}</ref> and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1917|1917]] (2010). The last of these extended the mandate of ISAF to 23 March 2011.

The mandates given by the different governments to their forces varied from country to country.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Some governments wished to take a full part in [[counter-insurgency]] operations;{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} some were in Afghanistan for NATO alliance reasons;{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} some were in the country partially because they wished to maintain their relationship with the United States,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and {{Original research inline|date=February 2013}} some were there for domestic political reasons.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} This meant that ISAF suffered from a lack of united aims.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==History==
[[File:ISAF Expansion 4-stages 2004-2006.jpg|thumb|Geographic depiction of the four ISAF stages (January 2009).]]

The initial ISAF headquarters (AISAF) was based on [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd UK Mechanised Division]], led at the time by Major General [[John McColl]]. This force arrived in December, 2001. Until ISAF expanded beyond Kabul, the force consisted of a roughly division-level headquarters and one brigade covering the capital, the Kabul Multinational Brigade. The brigade was composed of three battle groups, and was in charge of the tactical command of deployed troops. ISAF headquarters served as the operational control center of the mission.

Eighteen countries were contributors to the force in February, 2002, and it was expected to grow to 5,000 soldiers.<ref name="cdi1">[http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/isaf.cfm ISAF in Afghanistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020612025448/http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/isaf.cfm |date=12 June 2002 }} CDI, Terrorism Project – 14 February 2002.</ref> Turkey assumed command of ISAF in June, 2002 (Major General [[Hilmi Akin Zorlu]]). During this period, the number of Turkish troops increased from about 100 to 1,300. In November, 2002, ISAF consisted of 4,650 troops from over 20 countries. Around 1,200 German troops served in the force alongside 250 Dutch soldiers operating as part of a German-led battalion. Turkey relinquished command in February, 2003, and assumed command for a second time in February, 2005. Turkey's area of operations expanded into the rugged west of Afghanistan. The expansion of its zone of activities saw ISAF troops operating in 50 percent of Afghanistan, double its previous responsibility.<ref name="NTV">{{cite web|url=http://arsiv.ntv.com.tr/news/309517.asp|title=Turkey takes command of ISAF|work=ntv.com.tr|accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref>

On 10 February 2003, Lieutenant General [[Norbert van Heyst]], on behalf of Germany and the [[Netherlands]], took command of ISAF. His Deputy was Brigadier General [[Rob Bertholee|Bertholee]] of the Netherlands. The mission HQ was formed from HQ [[I.&nbsp;German/Dutch Corps]] (1GNC), including staff from the UK, Italy, Turkey, [[Norway]], and others.<ref name=":0">"International Security Assistance Force - Overall Command". NATO Military Forces, Strategy, Structure and Operations Handbook, vol. 1, USA International Business Publications, 2009, pp. 22.</ref> In March, 2003, ISAF was composed of 4,700 troops from 28 countries. Service in ISAF by NATO personnel from 1 June 2003. onward earns the right to wear the [[NATO Medal]] if a service-member met a defined set of tour length requirements.

In Kabul on 7 June 2003, a taxi packed with explosives rammed a bus carrying German ISAF personnel, killing four soldiers and wounding 29 others; one Afghan bystander was killed and 10 Afghan bystanders were wounded. The 33 German soldiers, after months on duty in Kabul, were en route to the Kabul International Airport for their flight home to Germany. At the time, Germans soldiers made up more than 40 percent of ISAF troops.

ISAF command originally rotated among different nations every six months. However, there was tremendous difficulty securing new lead nations. To solve the problem, command was turned over indefinitely to NATO on 11 August 2003.<ref name=":0" /> This marked NATO's first deployment outside Europe or North America.

* In February, 2002, [[South Korea]] sent a medical contingent of 99 soldiers.
* Between February and July, 2002, [[Portugal]] sent a sanitary team and an air team to ISAF.   
* A study by [[Care International]] in the summer of 2003 reported that [[Kosovo]] had one peacekeeper to 48 people, [[East Timor]] one for every 86, while Afghanistan has just one for every 5,380 people.

===Stage 1: to the north – completed October 2004===
* On 11 August 2003, NATO took command of ISAF, which consisted of 5,000 troops from more than 30 countries. About 90 percent of the force was contributed by NATO nations. By far the largest single contingent, 1,950 were Canadian. About 2,000 German troops were involved, and Romania had about 400 troops at the time.
* The first ISAF rotation under the command of NATO was led by Lieutenant General [[Goetz Gliemeroth]], Germany, with Canadian Army Major General [[Andrew Leslie (general)|Andrew Leslie]] as his deputy. Canada originally had been slated to take over command of ISAF on 11 August 2003.
* 13 October 2003: Resolution 1510 passed by the UN opened the way to a wider role for ISAF to support the government of Afghanistan beyond Kabul.
* In December, 2003, the [[North Atlantic Council]] authorized the [[Supreme Allied Commander, Europe]], [[General James Jones]], to initiate the expansion of ISAF by taking over command of the German-led PRT in Kunduz. The other eight PRTs operating in Afghanistan in 2003 remained under the command of Operation Enduring Freedom, the continuing U.S.‑led military operation in Afghanistan. On 31 December 2003, the military component of the Kunduz PRT was placed under ISAF command as a pilot project and first step in the expansion of the mission. Six months later, on 28 June 2004, at the Summit meeting of the NATO Heads of State and Government in [[Istanbul]], NATO announced that it would establish four other provincial reconstruction teams in the north of the country: in Mazar-i-Sharif, Meymana, [[Fayzabad, Badakhshan|Feyzabad]] and [[Baghlan]]. After the completion of Stage&nbsp;1 the ISAF's area of operations then covered about 3,600 square kilometers in the north, and the mission was able to influence security in nine Northern provinces of the country.<ref name="isaf-stages">[http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_8189.htm#missions NATO's role in Afghanistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408051204/http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_8189.htm |date=8 April 2009 }} NATO ISAF missions – 3 September 2009.</ref>
* As late as November, 2003, the entire ISAF force had only three [[helicopter]]s.
* On 9 February 2004, Lieutenant General [[Rick Hillier]] of Canada took command, with Major General Werner Korte of Germany as deputy. During this time-frame, Canada was the largest contributor to the ISAF force, providing 2,000 troops.
* In May, 2004, Turkey sent three helicopters and 56 flight and maintenance personnel to work in ISAF.
* In July, 2004, Portugal sent 24 soldiers and one C‑130 Hercules cargo plane to assist ISAF.
* On 7 August 2004, General [[Jean-Louis Py]], commander of [[Eurocorps]], took command of ISAF. Eurocorps contributors deploying to Afghanistan included France, Germany, Spain, [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]. Canada reduced its forces to about 800 personnel.
* In September, 2004, a Spanish [[battalion]] of about 800 personnel arrived to provide the ISAF Quick Reaction Force, and an [[Italian Army]] battalion of up to 1,000 troops arrived to provide the in‑theater Operational Reserve Force. With a force of 100, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] became the first [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] country to send an operational force to Afghanistan.
* Stage 1 (North) was completed in October, 2004, under the Regional Command of Germany.

===Stage 2: to the west – completed September 2005===
* In February, 2005, General [[Ethem Erdagi]] of Turkey took command
* On 10 February 2005, NATO announced that ISAF would be expanded into the west of Afghanistan. This process began on 31 May 2006, when ISAF took command of two additional [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]]s in the provinces of Herat and Farah, and of a Forward Support Base (a logistic base) in Herat. At the beginning of September, two additional ISAF-led PRTs in the west became operational, one in Chaghcharan, capital of Ghor province, and one in Qala-e-Naw, capital of Baghdis province; this completed ISAF's expansion into the west. The extended ISAF mission led a total of nine PRTs in the north and the west, providing security assistance in 50 percent of Afghanistan's territory.
* As the area of responsibility was increased, ISAF also took command of an increasing number of PRTs, with the aim of improving security and facilitating reconstruction outside the capital. The first nine PRTs (and lead nations) were based at [[Baghlan]] (Netherlands, then Hungary, in October, 2006), [[Chaghcharan]] (Lithuania), [[Farah, Afghanistan|Farah]] (U.S.), Fayzabad (Germany), [[Herat]] (Italy), Kunduz (Germany), [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] (U.K., then Denmark and Sweden, then Sweden and [[Finland]]), [[Maymana]] (U.K., then Norway), [[Qala i Naw, Afghanistan|Qala‑e Naw]] (Spain).
* In May, 2005, ISAF Stage&nbsp; 2 took place, doubling the size of the territory for which ISAF was responsible. The new area was the former U.S. [[Regional Command West]] consisting of Badghis, Farah, Ghor, and Herat Provinces.
* On 5 August 2005, Italian General [[Mauro del Vecchio]] assumed command of ISAF. During 2005, Italy commanded four multinational military operations: in Afghanistan, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Albania]].
* In September, 2005, ISAF Stage&nbsp;2 was completed under the Regional Command of Italy. The Alliance also temporarily deployed 2,000 additional troops to Afghanistan to support 18 September provincial and parliamentary elections.<ref name = "isaf-stages" />
* On 27 January 2006, it was announced in the British Parliament that ISAF would replace U.S.&nbsp;Operation Enduring Freedom troops in [[Helmand Province]]. The British [[16th Air Assault Brigade]] became the core of the force in Helmand Province.
* In February, 2006, the Netherlands expanded its troop contribution with an extra 1,400 soldiers.<ref name = "more_dutch"/>
* On 22 May 2006, a [[British Army]] [[WAH-64]] Apache gunship fired a [[Hellfire missile]] to destroy a French armored vehicle that had been disabled during a firefight with Taliban forces in North Helmand province the previous day, as it had been determined that attempting to recover the vehicle would have been too dangerous. This was the first time U.K. Apaches had opened fire in a hostile theater and was, after a fashion, the WAH-64's first "combat kill."

===Stage 3: to the south – completed July 2006===
{{Further|Coalition combat operations in Afghanistan in 2006}}
* On 8 December 2005, meeting at NATO Headquarters in [[Brussels]], the Allied Foreign Ministers endorsed a plan that paved the way for an expanded ISAF role and presence in Afghanistan. The first element of this plan was the expansion of ISAF to the south in 2006, also known as Stage 3. At the completion of this stage, the ISAF assumed command of the southern region of Afghanistan from U.S.‑led Coalition forces, expanding its area of operations to cover an additional six provinces – Day Kundi, Helmand, [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]], [[Nimroz]], Uruzgan, and [[Zabul]] – and taking on command of four additional PRTs. The expanded ISAF led a total of 13 PRTs in the north, west and south, covering some three-quarters of Afghanistan's territory. The number of ISAF forces in the country also increased significantly, from about 10,000 prior to the expansion to about 20,000 after.<ref name = "isaf-stages" />
* On 4 May 2006, United Kingdom General [[David Richards (general)|David Richards]] assumed command of the ISAF IX force in Afghanistan. The mission was led by the [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]].
* On 31 July 2006, Stage 3 was completed; the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force also assumed command in six provinces of the south. [[Regional Command South]] was established at Kandahar. Led by Canada, 8,000 soldiers were positioned there.
* With the Taliban regrouping, especially in its birthplace of Kandahar province bordering [[Pakistan]], NATO launched its biggest offensive against the guerrillas at the weekend of 2 and 3 September 2006 ([[Operation Medusa]]). NATO reported that it had killed more than 250 Taliban fighters, but the Taliban stated that NATO casualty estimates were exaggerated.
* On 7 September 2006, a British soldier was killed and six were wounded when their patrol strayed into an unmarked minefield in Helmand, the major opium poppy-growing province west of Kandahar.
* On 28 September 2006, the North Atlantic Council gave final authorization for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (NATO-ISAF) to expand its area of operations to 14 additional provinces in the east of Afghanistan, boosting NATO's presence and role in the country. With this further expansion, NATO-ISAF assisted the [[Government of Afghanistan]] in providing security throughout the entire country.<ref name = "jfcbs1">{{cite web|url=http://www.jfcbs.nato.int/ISAF/index.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920105820/http://www.jfcbs.nato.int/ISAF/index.htm |archivedate=20 September 2006 |title=International Security Assistance Force |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref> The expansion saw the NATO-ISAF controlling 32,000 troops from 37 countries, although by this stage, the alliance was struggling to find extra troops to hold off a spiraling Taliban-led insurgency in the volatile south.

===Stage 4: ISAF takes responsibility for entire country – completed October 2006===
* On 5 October 2006, ISAF implemented the final stage of its expansion by taking over command of the international military forces in eastern Afghanistan from the U.S.‑led Coalition. In addition to expanding the Alliance's area of operations, the revised operational plan also paved the way for a greater ISAF role in the country. This includes the deployment of ISAF [[Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team]]s (OMLTs) to Afghan National Army units at various levels of command.<ref name = "isaf-stages" />
* 10,000 more coalition troops moved under NATO command. 31,000 ISAF troops were now in Afghanistan and 8,000 U.S.&nbsp;troops continued separate training and counter-terrorism activities.
* On 21 October 2006, the Canadian government expressed frustration over the unwillingness of some European NATO members to deploy troops to help fight mounting Taliban resistance in the south.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[File:Anaconda Strategy vs Insurgents 101020.jpg|thumb|Anaconda Strategy vs the insurgents as of 2010-10-20.]]
* In November 2006, a study by the [[Joint Co-ordinating and Monitoring Board]], made up of the Afghan government, its key foreign backers and the U.N, suggested that more than 3,700 people died from January to November 2006. The majority of the dead appeared to be insurgents, but it was estimated that 1,000 civilians had been killed that year, along with members of the [[Afghan National Army]], ISAF, and U.S. [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] forces.<ref name = "bbc5">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6141762.stm |title=South Asia &#124; Afghan conflict deaths quadruple |work=BBC News |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref>
* On 28–29 November 2006, there was a NATO summit at [[Riga]], Latvia. Combat curbs were the most contentious issue at the two-day summit in Latvia, following tension over the reluctance of France, Germany, Spain, and Italy to send troops to southern Afghanistan. Countries agreeing to ease the restrictions on deployment against the Taliban insurgency included the Dutch, Romanians, and smaller nations such as Slovenia and Luxembourg. France, Germany, Spain, and Italy agreed to send help to trouble zones outside their areas, but only in emergencies. The summit also saw several countries offer additional troops and training teams. France agreed to send more helicopters and aircraft. NATO commanders said they believed they could move an additional 2,500 troops around the country after some smaller members relaxed their mission conditions.<ref name = "bbc6">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6195102.stm |title=Europe &#124; Nato hails shift on Afghan combat |work=BBC News |date=29 November 2006 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref>
* On 15 December 2006, ISAF started a new offensive, [[Operation Falcon Summit|Operation Baaz Tsuka]] (Falcon's Summit), against the Taliban in the [[Panjwaye District|Panjaway]] valley in Kandahar province.
* On 4 February 2007, U.S.&nbsp;General [[Dan K. McNeill]] replaced British General [[David Richards (British Army officer)|David Richards]] as commander of ISAF. Analysts reported that he planned to place a heavier emphasis on fighting than on peace deals.<ref name = "reuters_us">[https://www.reuters.com/articlePrint?articleId=USSP16017620070205 U.S. general in Afghanistan seen tough on Taliban] REUTERS – 5 February 2007</ref> Meanwhile, observers and commanders were expecting a new Taliban "spring offensive," and NATO commanders asked for more troops.
* On 6 March 2007, NATO-ISAF launched [[Operation Achilles]], an offensive to bring security to northern Helmand and set the conditions for meaningful development that would fundamentally improve the quality of life for Afghans in the area. The operation eventually involved more than 4,500 NATO troops and nearly 1,000 Afghan soldiers in Helmand province, according to the alliance. It focused on improving security in areas where Taliban extremists, narco-traffickers and other elements were trying to destabilize the government of Afghanistan, and on empowering village elders. The overarching purpose was to assist the government in improving its ability to begin reconstruction and economic development in the area. Strategically, the goal was also to enable the government to begin the [[Kajaki]] hydro-energy project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.hq.nato.int/isaf/update/press_releases/newsrelease/2007/pr070306-149.htm |title=ISAF and Afghan Forces launch major operation in the South |accessdate=2007-03-13 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313140805/http://www2.hq.nato.int/isaf/update/press_releases/newsrelease/2007/pr070306-149.htm |archivedate=13 March 2007}} NATO Press release – 6 March 2007 and [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6422105.stm Nato in major anti-Taleban drive] BBC – 6 March 2007</ref>

===Security and reconstruction===
{{Further|War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Timeline of the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)}}
From 2006, the insurgency by the Taliban intensified, especially in the southern [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] parts of the country, areas that were the Taliban's original power base in the mid‑1990s. After ISAF took over command of the south on 31 July 2006, British, Dutch, Canadian and Danish ISAF soldiers in the provinces of [[Helmand]], [[Uruzgan]], and Kandahar came under almost daily attack. British commanders said that the fighting for them was the fiercest since the Korean War, 50 years previously. In an article, BBC reporter [[Alistair Leithead]], embedded with the British forces, called it "Deployed to Afghanistan's hell."<ref name = "BBC_HELL">{{cite news|last=Leithead |first=Alistair |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/5245238.stm |title=Programmes &#124; From Our Own Correspondent &#124; Deployed to Afghanistan's 'Hell' |work=BBC News |date=5 August 2006 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref>

Because of the security situation in the south, ISAF commanders asked member countries to send more troops. On 19 October, for example, the Dutch government decided to send more troops because of increasing attacks by suspected Taliban on their [[Task Force Uruzgan]], making it very difficult to complete the reconstruction work that they sought to accomplish.{{clear}} Derogatory alternative acronyms for the ISAF were created by critics, including "I Saw Americans Fighting,"<ref>Killing the Cranes, by Edward Girardet, 2011, published by Chelsea Green</ref> "I Suck at Fighting," and "In Sandals and Flip Flops."<ref name=runaway>{{cite news|last=Hastings|first=Michael|title=The Runaway General|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-runaway-general-20100622?print=true|accessdate=1 October 2012|newspaper=Rolling Stone|date=22 June 2010}}</ref>

===ISAF and the illegal opium economy===
[[File:Afghan Opium Production 2005 2007.JPG|thumb|[[Opium production in Afghanistan|Opium production]] levels for 2005–2007]]
[[File:Afghanistan map - security by district and opium poppy cultivation by province 2007 - 2008.png|thumb|[[Taliban insurgency|Regional security risks]] of opium poppy cultivation in 2007–2008.]]

Prior to October, 2008, ISAF had only served an indirect role in fighting the illegal [[Opium production in Afghanistan|opium economy in Afghanistan]] through shared intelligence with the Afghan government, protection of Afghan poppy crop eradication units and helping in the coordination and the implementation of the country's counter-narcotics policy. For example, Dutch soldiers used military force to protect eradication units that came under attack.

Crop eradication often affects the poorest farmers who have no economic alternatives on which to fall back. Without alternatives, these farmers no longer can feed their families, causing anger, frustration, and social protest. Thus, being associated with this counterproductive drug policy, ISAF soldiers on the ground found it difficult to gain the support of the local population.<ref name = "twq_winter">[http://www.twq.com/07winter/docs/07winter_vanham.pdf The Washington Quarterly] Poppies for Peace: Reforming Afghanistan's Opium Industry</ref>

Though problematic for NATO, this indirect role allowed NATO to avoid the opposition of the local population who depended on the poppy fields for their livelihood. In October 2008, NATO altered its position in an effort to curb the financing of insurgency by the Taliban. Drug laboratories and drug traders became the targets, and not the poppy fields themselves.<ref name = "news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7663204.stm |title=South Asia &#124; Nato to attack Afghan opium labs |work=BBC News |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> In order to satisfy France, Italy and Germany, the deal involved the participation in an anti-drug campaign only of willing NATO member countries; the campaign was to be short-lived and with the cooperation of the Afghans.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/>

On 10 October 2008, during a news conference, after an informal meeting of NATO Defense Ministers in Budapest, Hungary, NATO Spokesman James Appathurai said:<ref>[[NATO]], [http://www.nato.int/docu/comm/2008/0810-budapest/0810-budapest.htm NATO Events: Informal Meeting of NATO Defence Ministers – Budapest], 9–10 October 2008, Retrieved on 10 October 2008</ref>

{{quote|...with regard to counter-narcotics, based on the request of the Afghan government, consistent with the appropriate U.N. Security Council Resolutions, under the existing operational plan, ISAF can act in concert with the Afghans against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency, subject to the authorization of respective nations.... The idea of a review is, indeed, envisioned for an upcoming meeting.}}

===Military and civilian casualties===
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2012}}
{{Main|Coalition casualties in Afghanistan|Civilian casualties of the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)}}
ISAF military casualties, and the civilian casualties caused by the war and Coalition/ISAF [[friendly fire]], became a major political issue, both in Afghanistan and in the troop contributing nations. Increasing civilian casualties threatened the stability of [[President of Afghanistan|President]] [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Hamid Karzai's government]].  Consequently, effective from 2 July 2009, coalition air and ground combat operations were ordered to take steps to minimize Afghan civilian casualties in accordance with a tactical directive issued by General [[Stanley A. McChrystal]], [[U.S. Army|USA]], the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Garamone |title=Directive Re-emphasizes Protecting Afghan Civilians |url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=55023 |work=[[American Forces Press Service]] |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Defense]] |date=6 July 2009 |accessdate=1 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014040037/http://www.defense.gov//News/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=55023 |archivedate=14 October 2012}} and {{cite web|title=Tactical Directive |url=http://www.nato.int/isaf/docu/official_texts/Tactical_Directive_090706.pdf |publisher=NATO/International Security Assistance Force |date=6 July 2009 |accessdate=2 October 2012 }}</ref>

Another issue over the years has been numerous 'insider' attacks involving Afghan soldiers opening fire on ISAF soldiers. While these diminished, in part due to the planned ending of combat operations on 31 December 2014, they continued to occur, albeit at a lower frequency. On 5 August 2014, a gunman believed to have been an Afghan soldier opened fire on a number of international soldiers, killing a U.S. general, [[Harold J. Greene]], and wounding about 15 officers and soldiers, including a German brigadier general and several U.S. soldiers, at a training academy near Kabul.<ref name="ShootingAfghanistan">{{cite news|title=American army officer killed, many wounded in Afghan insider attack|url=http://www.afghanistansun.com/index.php/sid/224460361|accessdate=7 August 2014|publisher=Afghanistan Sun}}</ref>

* {{Flagu|South Korea}} – The first South Korean contingent had been withdrawn by 14 December 2007 due to the expiration of its mandate, despite American calls for its continued presence. The withdrawal had been one of the pledges made to the Taliban captors of [[2007 South Korean hostage crisis in Afghanistan|21 South Korean Christian missionaries]] in July 2007, in return for the hostages' release. The deployment consisted of 60&nbsp;medics comprising the 'Dongeui' unit and 150 military engineers forming the 'Dasan' unit at Bagram Airbase, north of Kabul. They had been sent to Afghanistan in 2002 and 2003 respectively. Afterwards Seoul took only the role of providing medical and vocational training by assisting the United States with only two dozen volunteers working inside [[Bagram Air Base]], north of Kabul. According to an ISAF statement, on 30 June 2008 South Korea returned, operating a small hospital near the airbase in Bagram with military and civilian personnel. In December 2009, the South Korean defence ministry announced it would send 350 troops in 2010 to protect South Korean civilian engineers working on reconstruction. These troops would not engage in any fighting except to protect the base of the South Korean Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) and escort and protect the activities of the PRT members. The South Korean contingent would be based in [[Parwan]] province, just north of Kabul for 30 months from 1 July 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8400815.stm |title=South Korea confirms new troops for Afghanistan |work=BBC News |date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref> This invoked threats from the Taliban. In a statement e‑mailed to international media, Taliban insurgents said Seoul must be ready to face "bad consequences" if the troops were deployed. The South Korean government said it made no promises to stay out of Afghanistan when it withdrew its troops in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-12/09/content_12619661.htm |title=Taliban warns S Korea not to send more troops to Afghanistan |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131040725/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-12/09/content_12619661.htm |archivedate=31 January 2010}}</ref> South Korea redeployed its troops to Afghanistan in July 2010, and was the PRT leading nation in Parwan Province.
