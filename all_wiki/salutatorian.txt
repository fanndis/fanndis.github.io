'''Salutatorian''' is an academic title given in the [[United States]],  [[Armenia]], and the [[Philippines]] to the second-highest-ranked [[alumnus|graduate]] of the entire graduating class of a specific discipline. Only the [[valedictorian]] is ranked higher. This honor is traditionally based on [[grade point average]] (GPA) and number of credits taken, but consideration may also be given to other factors such as co-curricular and extracurricular activities. The title comes from the salutatorian's traditional role as the first speaker at a [[graduation]] ceremony, delivering the [[salutation]] (where the [[valedictorian]], on the other hand, speaks last, delivering the [[valediction]]). In a high school setting, a salutatorian may also be asked to speak about the current graduating class or to deliver an invocation or benediction. In some instances, the salutatorian may even deliver an introduction for the valedictorian. The general themes of a salutatorian speech and valediction are usually of growth, outlook towards the future, and thankfulness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/section/news|title=The latest Boston, local and national news|author=John-Waller|date=11 January 2016|website=Boston.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speech-topics-help.com/salutatorian-speech.html|title=10 Salutatorian Speech Ideas Multi-Functional • My Speech Class|date=12 May 2018|website=Speech-topics-help.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.best-speech-topics.com/example-of-a-valedictorian-speech.html|title=Example of a Valedictorian Speech|website=Best-speech-topics.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref>

== Latin salutatorian ==
At the universities of [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] a [[Latin]] orator, usually a [[classics]] [[Academic major|major]], is chosen for his or her ability to write and deliver a speech to the audience in that language. At Princeton, this speaker is known as the "Latin salutatorian"; at Harvard the Latin oration, though not called a "salutatory" address as such, occurs first among the three student orations, and fulfills the traditional function of salutation.  These traditions date from the earliest years of the universities, when all graduates were expected to have attained proficiency in the "Learned Languages," ''i.e.,'' Latin and Greek.<ref>Charter of the College of New Jersey (1746).</ref>

== Awards ==
Salutatorians are usually awarded silver medals, with valedictorians receiving the gold medal during the graduation ceremony.
