The '''economy of the Philippines''' is the world's  [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|29th largest economy by nominal GDP]] according to the International Monetary Fund 2020 and the [[Economy of Asia|13th largest economy]] in Asia. The [[Philippines]] is one of the [[emerging markets]] and the 3rd highest in Southeast Asia by GDP nominal after [[Thailand]] and [[Indonesia]].

The Philippines is primarily considered a [[newly industrialized country]], which has an economy in transition from one based on agriculture to one based more on services and manufacturing. As of 2020, GDP by [[purchasing power parity]] was estimated to be at $1.01 trillion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=23&pr.y=10&sy=2016&ey=2016&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=566&s=PPPGDP&grp=0&a=|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|website=imf.org}}</ref>

Primary exports include semiconductors and electronic products, transport equipment, garments, copper products, petroleum products, coconut oil, and fruits. Major trading partners include [[Japan]], [[China]], the [[United States]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Germany]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Thailand]]. The Philippines has been named as one of the [[Tiger Cub Economies]] together with [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Thailand]]. It is currently one of Asia's fastest growing economies. However, major problems remain, mainly having to do with alleviating the wide income and growth disparities between the country's different regions and socioeconomic classes, reducing corruption, and investing in the infrastructure necessary to ensure future growth.

The Philippine economy is projected to be the 5th largest in Asia and 16th biggest in the world by 2050.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pwc-ranking-of-biggest-economies-ppp-2050-2017-2|title=RANKED: These will be the 32 most powerful economies in the world by 2050|last=Martin|first=Will|website=Business Insider|access-date=February 8, 2020}}</ref> According to the [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], it estimates that it will be the 12th to 14th richest economy in the world by 2060.{{cn|date=October 2020}} While this opposes other reports from [[HSBC|HSBC Holdings PLC]], that by the year 2050, the Philippines will have been stated in 2050 maybe due to its yearly higher GDP growth rate of 6.5% (Second, after China).

The economic history of the Philippine Islands had been traced back to the pre-colonial times. The country which was then composed of different kingdoms and thalassocracies oversaw the large number of merchants coming to the islands for trade. [[Indian people|Indian]], [[Arabian people|Arab]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] merchants were welcomed by these kingdoms, which were mostly located by riverbanks, coastal ports and central plains. The merchants traded for goods such as gold, rice, pots and other products. The [[barter system]] was implemented at that time and the pre-colonial people enjoyed a life filled with imported goods which reflected their fashion and lifestyle.

From the 12th century, a huge industry centred around the manufacture and trade of burnay clay pots, used for the storage of tea and other perishables, was set up in the northern Philippines with Japanese and Okinawan traders. These pots were known as 'Ruson-tsukuri' (Luzon-made) in Japanese, and were considered among the best storage vessels used for the purpose of keeping tea leaves and rice wine fresh. Hence, Ruson-Tsukuri pots became sought after in Northeast Asia. Each Philippine kiln had its own branding symbol, marked on the bottom of the Ruson-tsukuri by a single [[baybayin]] letter.

The people also were great agriculturists and the islands especifically [[Luzon]] has great abundance of rice, fowls, wine as well as great numbers of carabaos, deer, wild boar and goats. In addition, there were also great quantities of cotton and colored clothes, wax, honey and date palms produced by the natives. The precolonial state of [[Caboloan]]  in [[Pangasinan]] often exported deer-skins to [[Japan]] and [[Okinawa]]. The Nation of [[Ma-i]] produced beeswax, cotton, true pearls, tortoise shell, medicinal betel nuts and yuta cloth in their trade with East Asia. By the early sixteenth century, the two largest polities of the [[List of islands in the Greater Manila Area|Pasig River delta]], [[Rajahnate of Maynila|Maynila]] and [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]], established a shared monopoly on the trade of Chinese goods throughout the rest of the Philippine archipelago.<ref name="Dery2001">{{cite book | last = Dery  | first = Luis Camara  | authorlink =  | title = A History of the Inarticulate  | publisher = New Day Publishers  | year = 2001  | location = Quezon City  | pages =  | volume =  | edition =  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 978-971-10-1069-0  }}</ref>

The Visayas islands which is home to the [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]], the Kedatuan of Dapitan and the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] on the other hand were abundant in rice, fish, cotton, swine, fowls, wax and honey. [[Leyte]] was said to produce two rice crops a year, and Pedro Chirino commented on the great rice and cotton harvests that were sufficient to feed and clothe the people.

In Mindanao, the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] specialized in the mining of gold and the manufacture of jewelry. The [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]] was known for the raising and harvesting of [[cinnamon]]. The [[Confederation of sultanates in Lanao|Sultanate of Lanao]] had a fishing industry by lake Lanao and the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] had lively pearl-diving operations.

The kingdoms of ancient Philippines were active in international trade, and they used the ocean as natural highways.<ref name="great">[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2009/jan/18/yehey/weekend/20090118week1.html From the mountains to the seas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521091413/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2009/jan/18/yehey/weekend/20090118week1.html |date=May 21, 2009 }}.

Aside from trade relations, the natives were also involved in aquaculture and fishing. The natives make use of the ''salambao'', which is a type of raft that utilizes a large [[fishing net]] which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles made from a particular type of resin similar to the copal of Mexico. Use of safe pens for incubation and protection of the small fry from predators was also observed, and this method astonished the Spaniards at that time.<ref name="geo" /> During fishing, large mesh nets were also used by the natives to protect the young and ensure future good catches.

From the early 1500s to as late as the 1560s, people from [[Luzon]], Philippines; were referred to in Portuguese Malacca as [[Luções]], and they set up many overseas communities across Southeast Asia where they participated in trading ventures and military campaigns in [[Taungoo Dynasty|Burma]], [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] and [[East Timor|Eastern Timor]]<ref>Lucoes warriors aided the Burmese king in his invasion of Siam in 1547&nbsp;AD.

The natives were slavered among them by other tribes like Lapu-Lapu which forced other islands to pay taxes. The arrival of the Spanish removed this slavering system. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi with Tlaxcaltecs from Mexico conquered and unified the islands. The conquered was possible thanks to the discovery of the trip back to Mexico coast by Agustino Urdaneta. The administration of Islas Filipinas was done through the Capitania General and depended on Mexico Capital which formed the New Spain Viceroyalty. The economy of Islas Filipinas grew further when the Spanish government inaugurated the [[Manila Galleon]] trade system.

Both cities were part of the then Province of [[New Spain]].

This trade made the city of Manila one of the major [[global cities]] in the world, improving the growth of the Philippine economy in the succeeding years. Trade also introduced foodstuffs such as [[maize]], [[tomato]]es, [[potato]]es, [[chili pepper]]s, [[chocolate]] and [[pineapple]]s from [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]]. [[Tobacco]], first domesticated in Latin-America, and then introduced to the Philippines, became an important cash crop for Filipinos. The Philippines also became the distribution center of silver mined in the Americas, which was in high demand in Asia, during the period.<ref>1996. “Silk for Silver: Manila-Macao Trade in the 17th Century.” Philippine Studies 44, 1:52–68.</ref> In exchange for this silver, Manila gathered Indonesian spices, Chinese silks and Indian gems to be exported to Mexico.<ref>Chuan, Hang-sheng. 2001. “The Chinese Silk Trade with Spanish-America from the Late Ming Period to the Mid-Ch’ing Period.” In Studia Asiatica Essays in Asian Studies in Felicitation to the Seventy-fifth Anniversary of Professor Ch’en Shouyi, ed.

The Manila Galleon system operated until 1815, when Mexico got its independence. Nevertheless, it didn't affect the economy of the islands.

On March 10, 1785, [[King Charles III of Spain]] confirmed the establishment of the Royal Philippine Company with a 25-year charter. The Basque-based company was granted a monopoly on the importation of Chinese and Indian goods into the Philippines, as well as the shipping of the goods directly to Spain via the [[Cape of Good Hope]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eang|first=Cheong Weng|date=1970|title=Changing the Rules of the Game (The India-Manila Trade: 1785–1809)1|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-southeast-asian-studies/article/changing-the-rules-of-the-game-the-indiamanila-trade-178518091/DFED0589509EC155F2EC9C91A201D637|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=1–19|doi=10.1017/S002246340002021X|issn=1474-0680|via=}}</ref>

After Spain lost Mexico as a territory, New Spain was dissolved making the Philippines and other Pacific islands to form the [[Spanish East Indies]]. This resulted in the Philippines being governed directly by the [[King of Spain]] and the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines]] while the Pacific islands of [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Guam]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Palau]] was governed by the [[Real Audiencia of Manila]] and was part of the Philippine territorial governance.

It made the economy of the Philippines grow further as people saw the rise of opportunities. Agriculture remained the largest contributor to economy, being the largest producer of [[coffee]] in Asia as well as a large produce of [[tobacco]].

In [[Europe]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] spread from [[Great Britain]] during the period known as the [[Victorian Age]]. The industrialization of Europe created great demands for raw materials from the colonies, bringing with it investment and wealth, although this was very unevenly distributed. [[José Basco y Vargas|Governor-General Basco]] had opened the Philippines to this trade. Previously, the Philippines was seen as a trading post for international trade but in the nineteenth century it was developed both as a source of raw materials and as a market for manufactured goods. The economy of the Philippines rose rapidly and its local industries developed to satisfy the rising demands of an industrializing Europe. A small flow of European immigrants came with the opening of the Suez Canal, which cut the travel time between Europe and the Philippines by half. New ideas about government and society, which the friars and colonial authorities found dangerous, quickly found their way into the Philippines, notably through the Freemasons, who along with others, spread the ideals of the American, French and other revolutions, including Spanish liberalism.

In 1834 the Royal Company of the Philippines was abolished, and free trade was formally recognized. With its excellent harbor, Manila became an open port for Asian, European, and North American traders. European merchants alongside the Chinese immigrants opened stores selling goods from all parts of the world. The ''El Banco Español Filipino de Isabel II ''(now the [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]]) was the first bank opened in the Philippines in 1851.

In 1873 additional ports were opened to foreign commerce, and by the late nineteenth century three crops—tobacco, abaca, and sugar—dominated Philippine exports.

== First Philippine Republic (1899–1901) ==

The economy of the Philippines during the insurgency of the [[First Philippine Republic]] remained the same throughout its early years but was halted due to the break out of the [[Philippine–American War]]. Nevertheless, during the era of the First Republic, the estimated [[GDP per capita]] for the Philippines in 1900 was of $1,033.00. That made it the second richest place in all of Asia, just a little behind Japan ($1,135.00), and far ahead of China ($652.00) or India ($625.00).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_gdp_per_cap_in_190-economy-gdp-per-capita-1900|title=GDP per capita in 1900 by country.

== American Era (1901–40) ==
[[File:Manilastreetcar.jpg|200px|thumb|Manila in the 1900s]]
The results of the economy under the Americans were mixed. An initial high growth phase occurred during the 1910s due to the recovery from the wars with Spain and the US, and investment in agriculture. The Philippines would at first briefly outpace its neighbors. This would not last as growth fell behind in the later years. Stagnation in the late 1920s and beyond took place as access to US markets became restricted by protectionist quotas and fiscal restraints forestalled any further development in agriculture.<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. "American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902–1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics," Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 465, June.</ref>

The growth period can be attributed to the results of a crash program in agricultural modernization undertaken in 1910–1920. This in turn was done in order to address the growing shortfall in the supply of rice. The Philippines once a net exporter became an importer of rice as a result of the wars with the Spanish and later the Americans and by the reallocation of labour to export crops.<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. "American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902–1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics," Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 467, June.</ref>

The 1930s would mark the end to this period of relative prosperity. The Sugar Act of 1934 capped Philippines sugar exports to the US at 921,000 tons per year. Expenditure on public infrastructure for agriculture was reduced as the Payne–Aldridge Act stripped the government of customs revenue. Manila hemp was now competing against the newly invented [[Nylon]]. Although the area of land cultivated for agriculture was still increasing, the rate was reduced to 1% per annum.<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. "American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902–1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics," Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 475, June.</ref>

[[File:Jones-Bridge-skyview-with-Post-Office-1930s.jpg|thumb|1930s Manila overlooking the Pasig River and Manila Central Post Office]]
The policy with the most far reaching consequences of this period was the peg between the peso and dollar. This was enforced by law until 1975. It provided monetary stability for foreign investment inflows, which lead to 40% of all capital invested in manufacturing and commercial enterprises to be owned by foreign entities by 1938. On the other hand, this overvaluation of the peso would have a negative impact with foreign trade with the rest of Asia. Economic policy leading to independence would have necessitated loosening trade links with the US. In order to achieve an internationally competitive exchange rate, the peso dollar link would have to be broken. The much belated move to a true floating exchange rate led to uncompetitive exports as such an import substitution strategy remained until significant currency devaluation opened up the opportunity for reorienting towards exports.<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. "American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902–1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics," Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 479, June.</ref>

=== World War II (1941–45) ===

Due to the Japanese invasion establishing the unofficial [[Second Philippine Republic]], the economic growth receded and food shortages occurred. Prioritizing the shortages of food, Jose Laurel, the appointed President, organized an agency to distribute rice, even though most of the rice was confiscated by Japanese soldiers. Manila was one of the many places in the country that suffered from severe shortages, due mainly to a typhoon that struck the country in November 1943. The people were forced to cultivate private plots which produced root crops like [[kangkong]]. The Japanese, in order to raise rice production in the country, brought a quick-maturing horai rice, which was first used in Taiwan. Horai rice was expected to make the Philippines self-sufficient in rice by 1943, but rains during 1942 prevented this.

[[File:PHI-114-Japanese Government (Philippines)-500 Pesos (1944).jpg|right|thumb|Japanese Invasion Money – Philippines 500 Pesos]]
Also during World War II in the Philippines, the occupying Japanese government issued fiat currency in several denominations; this is known as the [[Japanese government-issued Philippine peso|Japanese government-issued Philippine fiat peso]].

The first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought "''replacement notes''" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or "''bayong''" (native bags made of woven coconut or ''[[Corypha|buri]]'' leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills.<ref name=kasaysayan>{{cite book|title=Kasaysayan: History of the Filipino People, Volume 7|year=1990|work=Reader's Digest}}</ref> In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 ''Mickey Mouse'' pesos.<ref>[[Teodoro Agoncillo|Agoncillo, Teodoro A.]] & Guerrero, Milagros C., ''History of the Filipino People'', 1986, R.P.

=== Third Philippine Republic (1946–65) ===
After the re-establishment of the Commonwealth in 1945, the country was left with a devastated city, food crisis and financial crisis. A year later in 1946, the Philippines got its independence in America, creating the [[Third Philippine Republic]].

In an effort to solve the massive socio-economic problems of the period, newly elected President [[Manuel Roxas]] reorganized the government, and proposed a wide-sweeping legislative program. Among the undertakings of the Third Republic's initial year were: The establishment of the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (which would be reorganized in 1958 as the Development Bank of the Philippines);<ref>History of the Development Bank of the Philippines, About DBP accessed on July 2, 2015</ref> the creation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the organization of the foreign service through Executive Order No. 18; the GI Bill of Rights for Filipino veterans; and the revision of taxation laws to increase government revenues.<ref>''Blue Book of the First Year of the Republic'', Manila: Bureau of Printing, 1947, p. 27</ref>

President Roxas moved to strengthen sovereignty by proposing a Central Bank for the Philippines to administer the Philippine banking system<ref>"Creating a Central Bank for the Philippines", Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas website, accessed on July 2, 2015</ref> which was established by Republic Act No. 265.

In leading a "cash-starved<ref>Gleeck, Lewis, ''The Third Republic'', New Day Publishers, Quezon City,1993, p.47</ref> government" that needed to attend a battered nation, President Roxas campaigned for the parity amendment to the 1935 Constitution. This amendment, demanded by the Philippine Trade Relations Act or the Bell Trade Act,<ref>Leclerc, Grégoire and Hall, Charles A. S., ''Making World Development Work: Scientific Alternatives to Neoclassical Economic Theory'', (New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press, 2007)</ref> would give American citizens and industries the right to utilize the country's natural resources in return for rehabilitation support from the United States. The President, with the approval of Congress, proposed this move to the nation through a plebiscite.

The Roxas administration also pioneered the foreign policy of the Republic. Vice President Elpidio Quirino was appointed Secretary of Foreign Affairs. General Carlos P. Romulo, as permanent representative<ref>Castro, Pacifico A., ''Diplomatic Agenda of the Philippine Presidents'', Foreign Service Institute, Manila, 1985, p. 1.</ref> of the Philippines to the United Nations, helped shape the country's international identity in the newly established stage for international diplomacy and relations. During the Roxas administration, the Philippines established diplomatic ties with foreign countries and gained membership to international entities, such as the United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labor Organization (ILO), etc.

When President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] won the elections, his administration promoted the "Filipino First" policy, whose focal point was to regain economic independence; a national effort by Filipinos to "obtain major and dominant participation in their economy."<ref>Carlos P. Garcia, "Third State of the Nation Address," January 25, 1960, ''Official Gazette'', January 25, 1960, accessed on July 2, 2015,</ref> The administration campaigned for the citizens' support in patronizing Filipino products and services, and implemented import and currency controls favorable for Filipino industries.<ref>Abinales, Patricio N., Amoroso, Donna J., ''State and Society in the Philippines''. Maryland: Rowman & Little Publishers, Inc., 2005. p. 182,</ref> In connection with the government's goal of self-sufficiency was the "Austerity Program," which President Garcia described in his first State of the NatIon Address as "more work, more thrift, more productive investment, and more efficiency" that aimed to mobilize national savings.<ref>McFerson, Hazel M. ''Mixed Blessing: The Impact of the American Colonial Experience on Politics and Society in the Philippines''. Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2002., p. 227,</ref> The Anti Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, through Republic Act No. 301, aimed to prevent corruption, and promote honesty and public trust. Another achievement of the Garcia administration was the Bohlen–Serrano Agreement of 1959, which shortened the term of lease of the US military bases in the country from the previous 99 to 25 years.<ref>Cooley, Alexander, ''Base Politics: Dramatic Change and the U.S. Military Overseas'', NY: Cornell University Press, 2008, p. 68,</ref>

President Diosdado Macapagal, during his inaugural address on December 30, 1961, emphasized the responsibilities and goals to be attained in the "new era" that was the Macapagal administration. He reiterated his resolve to eradicate corruption, and assured the public that honesty would prevail in his presidency. President Macapagal, too, aimed at self-sufficiency and the promotion of every citizen's welfare, through the partnership of the government and private sector, and to alleviate poverty by providing solutions for unemployment.

Among the laws passed during the Macapagal administration were: Republic Act No. 3844 or the Agricultural Land Reform Code (an act that established the Land Bank of the Philippines);<ref>"History: Milestones in Corporate Existence", Landbank web site, accessed on July 2, 2015,</ref> Republic Act No. 3466, which established the Emergency Employment Administration; Republic Act No. 3518, which established the Philippine Veterans Bank; Republic Act No. 3470, which established the National Cottage Industries Development Authority (NACIDA) to organize, revive, and promote the establishment of local cottage industries; and Republic Act No. 4156, which established the Philippine National Railways (PNR) to operate the national railroad and tramways. The administration lifted [[foreign exchange controls]] as part of the decontrol program in an attempt to promote national economic stability and growth.

=== Marcos Era (1965–86) ===
{{main|Economic history of the Philippines (1965–86)|Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos}}
President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared [[martial law]] in the midst of rising student movements and an increasing number communist and socialist groups lobbying for reforms in their respective sectors. Leftists held rallies to express their frustrations to the government, this restiveness culminating in the [[First Quarter Storm]], where activists stormed [[Malacañang Palace]] only to be turned back by the [[Philippine Constabulary]].{{When|date=July 2012}} This event in particular left four people dead and many injured after heavy exchanges of gunfire. There was further unrest, and in the middle of the disorder on September 21, 1972, Marcos issued [[Proclamation No. 1081]], effectively installing martial law in the Philippines, a declaration that suspended civil rights and imposed military rule in the country.

The GDP of the Philippines rose during the [[martial law]], rising from P55 million to P193 million in about 8 years. This growth was spurred by massive lending from commercial banks, accounting for about 62% percent of external debt.<ref name="multiple1">{{cite book|last=De Dios|first=Emmanuel|title=An Analysis of the Philippine Economic Crisis|year=1984|publisher=University of the Philippines Press|location=Diliman, Q.C.}}</ref> As a developing country, the Philippines during the martial law was one of the heaviest borrowers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} These aggressive moves were seen by critics as a means of legitimizing martial law by purportedly enhancing the chances of the country in the global market. Much of the money was spent on pump-priming to improve infrastructure and promote [[tourism]]. However, despite the aggressive borrowing and spending policies, the [[Philippines]] lagged behind its Southeast Asia counterparts in GDP growth rate per capita. The country, in 1970–1980, only registered an average 5.73 percent growth, while its counterparts like [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Indonesia]] garnered a mean growth of 7.97 percent. This lag, which became very apparent at the end of the Marcos Regime, can be attributed to the failures of economic management that was brought upon by State-run monopolies, mismanaged exchange rates, imprudent monetary policy and debt management, all underpinned by rampant corruption and [[Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos|cronyism]]. As said by Emannuel de Dios “[…]main characteristics distinguishing the Marcos years from other periods of our history has been the trend towards the concentration of power in the hands of the government, and the use of governmental functions to dispense economic privileges to some small factions in the private sector.”<ref name="multiple1" />

There are few more palpable and glaring examples of the economic mismanagement of the time than the [[Bataan Nuclear Power Plant]] (BNPP) located in [[Morong, Bataan]]. Started in the 1970s, the BNPP was supposed to boost the country's competitiveness by providing affordable electricity to fuel industrialization and job creation in the country. Far from this, the US$2.3 billion nuclear plant suffered from cost over-runs and engineering and structural issues which eventually led to its mothballing—without generating a single watt of electricity.

[[Income inequality]] grew during the era of martial law, as the poorest 60 percent of the nation were able to contribute only 22.5 percent of the income at 1980, down from 25.0 percent in 1970. The richest 10 percent, meanwhile, took a larger share of the income at 41.7 percent at 1980, up from 37.1 percent at 1970.<ref name="multiple1" /> These trends coincided with accusations of [[cronyism]] in the Marcos administration, as the administration faced questions of favoring certain companies that were close to the ruling family.

According to the FIES (Family Income and Expenditure Survey) conducted from 1965 to 1985, [[poverty]] incidence in the Philippines rose from 41 percent in 1965 to 58.9 percent in 1985. This can be attributed to lower real agricultural wages and lesser real wages for unskilled and skilled laborers. Real agricultural wages fell about 25 percent from their 1962 level, while real wages for unskilled and skilled laborers decreased by about one-third of their 1962 level. It was observed that higher labor force participation and higher incomes of the rich helped cushion the blow of the mentioned problems.{{How|date=July 2012}}

=== Aquino Administration (1986–92) ===
{{main|Presidency of Corazon Aquino}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
The Aquino administration took over an economy that had gone through socio-political disasters during the People Power revolution, where there was financial and commodity collapse caused by an overall consumer cynicism, a result of the propaganda against cronies, social economic unrest resulting from numerous global shortages, massive protests, lack of government transparency, the opposition's speculations, and various assassination attempts and failed coups. At that point in time, the country's incurred debt from the Marcos Era's debt-driven development began crippling the country, which slowly made the Philippines the "Latin-American in East Asia" as it started to experience the worst recession since the post-war era.

Most of the immediate efforts of the Aquino administration was directed in reforming the image of the country and paying off all debts, including those that some governments were ready to write-off, as possible. This resulted in budget cuts and further aggravated the plight of the lower class because the jobs offered to them by the government was now gone. Infrastructure projects, including repairs, were halted in secluded provinces turning concrete roads into asphalt. Privatization of many government corporations, most catering utilities, was the priority of the Aquino administration which led to massive lay-offs and inflation. The Aquino administration was persistent in its belief that the problems that arose from the removal of the previous administration can be solved by the decentralization of power.

Growth gradually began in the next few years of the administration. Somehow, there was still a short-lived, patchy, and erratic recovery from 1987 to 1991 as the political situation stabilized a bit. With this, the peso became more competitive, confidence of investors was gradually regained, positive movements in terms of trade were realized, and regional growth gradually strengthened.

=== Ramos Administration (1992–98) ===
{{main|Presidency of Fidel Ramos}}
The Ramos administration basically served its role as the carrier of the momentum of reform and as an important vehicle in "hastening the pace of liberalization and openness in the country".<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 106</ref> The administration was a proponent of [[capital account]] liberalization, which made the country more open to foreign trade, investments, and relations. It was during the term of the administration when the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] was established, and the Philippines joined the [[World Trade Organization]] and other free trade associations such as the [[APEC]]. Also, debt reduction was considered and as such, the issuance of certain government bonds called [[Brady Bonds]] also came to fruition in 1992. Key negotiations with conflicting forces in Mindanao actually became more successful during the administration, with Jose Almonte as one of the key adviser of the administration.

By the time Ramos succeeded Corazon Aquino in 1992, the Philippine economy was already burdened with a heavy budget deficit. This was largely the result of austerity measures imposed by a standard credit arrangement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the destruction caused by natural disasters such as the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Hence, according to Canlas, pump priming through government spending was immediately ruled out due to the deficit. Ramos therefore resorted to institutional changes through structural policy reforms, of which included privatization and deregulation. He sanctioned the formation of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC), which served as a forum for consensus building, on the part of the Executive and the Legislative branches, on important bills on economic policy reform measures (4).

The daily brownouts that plagued the economy were also addressed through the enactment of policies that placed guaranteed rates. The economy during the first year of Ramos administration suffered from severe power shortage, with frequent brownouts, each lasting from 8 to 12 hours. To resolve this problem, the Electric Power Crisis Act was made into law together with the Build-Operate-Transfer Law. Twenty power plants were built because of these, and in effect, the administration was able to eliminate the power shortage problems in December 1993 and sustained economic growth for some time.<ref>Canlas, p. 4–5</ref>

The economy seemed to be all set for long-run growth, as shown by sustainable and promising growth rates from 1994 to 1997. However, the Asian Crisis contagion which started from Thailand and Korea started affecting the Philippines. This prompted the Philippine economy to plunge into continuous devaluation and very risky ventures, resulting in property busts and a negative growth rate. The remarkable feat of the administration, however, was that it was able to withstand the contagion effect of the Asian Crisis better than anybody else in the neighboring countries. Most important in the administration was that it made clear the important tenets of reform, which included economic liberalization, stronger institutional foundations for development, redistribution, and political reform.<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 57–59</ref>

Perhaps some of the most important policies and breakthroughs of the administration are the Capital Account Liberalization and the subsequent commitments to free trade associations such as APEC, AFTA, GATT, and WTO. The liberalization and opening of the capital opening culminated in full-peso convertibility in 1992.<ref name="Balisacanand">Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 21</ref> And then another breakthrough is again, the establishment of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which also involved the reduction of debts in that the debts of the old central bank were taken off its books.

=== Estrada Administration (1998–2001) ===
{{main|Presidency of Joseph Estrada}}
Although Estrada's administration had to endure the continued shocks of the Asian Crisis contagion, the administration was also characterized by the administration's economic mismanagement and "midnight cabinets." As if the pro-poor rhetoric, promises and drama were not really appalling enough, the administration also had "midnight cabinets composed of 'drinking buddies' influencing the decisions of the "daytime cabinet'".<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 19</ref> [[Cronyism]] and other big issues caused the country's image of economic stability to change towards the worse. And instead of adjustments happening, further deterioration of the economy occurred. Targeted revenues were not reached, implementation of policies became very slow, and fiscal adjustments were not efficiently conceptualized and implemented. All those disasters caused by numerous mistakes were made worse by the sudden entrance of the ''[[Jueteng]]'' controversy, which gave rise to the succeeding EDSA Revolutions.

Despite all these controversies, the administration still had some meaningful and profound policies to applaud. The administration presents a reprise of the population policy, which involved the assisting of married couples to achieve their fertility goals, reduce unwanted fertility and match their unmet need for contraception. The administration also pushed for budget appropriations for family planning and contraceptives, an effort that was eventually stopped due to the fact that the church condemned it.<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 299</ref> The administration was also able to implement a piece of its overall Poverty Alleviation Plan, which involved the delivery of social services, basic needs, and assistance to the poor families. The Estrada administration also had limited contributions to Agrarian Reform, perhaps spurred by the acknowledgement that indeed, Agrarian Reform can also address poverty and inequitable control over resources. In that regard, the administration establishes the program "Sustainable Agrarian Reform Communities-Technical Support to Agrarian and Rural Development".<ref>Villegas, p. 646–647</ref> As for regional development, however, the administration had no notable contributions or breakthroughs.

=== Macapagal-Arroyo's Administration (2001–10) ===
{{main|Presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo}}
The Arroyo administration, in an economical standpoint, was a period of good growth rates simultaneous with the US, due perhaps to the emergence of the [[Overseas Filipino]] workers (OFW) and the [[Business Process Outsourcing]] (BPO). The emergence of the OFW and the BPO improved the contributions of OFW remittances and investments to growth. In 2004, however, fiscal deficits grew and grew as tax collections fell, perhaps due to rampant and wide scale [[tax avoidance and tax evasion]] incidences. Fearing that a doomsday prophecy featuring the [Argentina default] in 2002 might come to fruition, perhaps due to the same sort of fiscal crisis, the administration pushed for the enactment of the 12% VAT and the E-VAT to increase tax revenue and address the large fiscal deficits. This boosted fiscal policy confidence and brought the economy back on track once again.

Soon afterwards, political instability afflicted the country and the economy anew with [[Abu Sayyaf]] terrors intensifying. The administration's Legitimacy Crisis also became a hot issue and threat to the authority of the Arroyo administration. Moreover, the Arroyo administration went through many raps and charges because of some controversial deals such as the NBN-ZTE Broadband Deal. Due however to the support of local leaders and the majority of the House of Representatives, political stability was restored and threats to the administration were quelled and subdued. Towards the end of the administration, high inflation rates for rice and oil in 2008 started to plague the country anew, and this led to another fiscal crisis, which actually came along with the major recession that the United States and the rest of the world were actually experiencing.

The important policies of the Arroyo administration highlighted the importance of regional development, tourism, and foreign investments into the country. Therefore, apart from the enactment and establishment of the E-VAT policy to address the worsening fiscal deficits, the administration also pushed for regional development studies in order to address certain regional issues such as disparities in regional per capita income and the effects of commercial communities on rural growth.<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Dynamics'', p. 378</ref> The administration also advocated for investments to improve tourism, especially in other unexplored regions that actually need development touches as well. To further improve tourism, the administration launched the policy touching on Holiday Economics, which involves the changing of days in which we would celebrate certain holidays. Indeed, through the Holiday Economics approach, investments and tourism really improved. As for investment, the Arroyo administration would frequently visit other countries to encourage foreign investment for the betterment of the Philippine economy and its development.

=== Benigno Aquino III's Administration (2010–16) ===
{{main|Presidency of Benigno Aquino III}}
[[File:Philippine economic boom.png|thumb|left|Philippine GDP growth 2000–2016]]
The Philippines consistently coined as one of the Newly Industrialized Countries has had a fair gain during the latter years under the Arroyo Presidency to the current administration. The government managed foreign debts falling from 58% in 2008 to 47% of total government borrowings. According to the 2012 World Wealth Report, the Philippines was the fastest growing economy in the world in 2010 with a GDP growth of 7.3% driven by the growing business process outsourcing and overseas remittances.<ref name=PHGrowth>{{cite news |title=Philippines, 6th fastest growing in the world: wealth report|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/10928-ph-to-post-high-growth-until-2050 |work=Rappler |date=August 21, 2012 |accessdate=August 21, 2012}}</ref>

The country markedly slipped to 3.6% in 2011 after the government placed less emphasis on exports, as well as spending less on infrastructure. In addition, the disruption of the flow of imports for raw materials as a result from floods in Thailand and the tsunami in Japan affected the manufacturing sector in the same year. "The Philippines contributed more than $125 million as of end-2011 to the pool of money disbursed by the International Monetary Fund to help address the financial crisis confronting economies in Europe. This was according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which reported Tuesday that the Philippines, which enjoys growing foreign exchange reserves, has made available about $251.5 million to the IMF to finance the assistance program—the Financial Transactions Plan (FTP)—for crisis-stricken countries."<ref name=PHLeander>{{cite news |title=Philippines contributed $125M to IMF as of end-'11 |url=http://business.inquirer.net/45725/philippines-contributed-125m-to-imf-as-of-end-%E2%80%9911|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=February 22, 2012 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}</ref>

The economy saw continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% since 2012. The Philippine Stock Exchange index ended 2012 with 5,812.73 points a 32.95% growth from the 4,371.96-finish in 2011.<ref name=TheGlobalEconomy.com>{{cite news |title=Philippines: Economic growth |url=http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Philippines/Economic_growth/ |publisher=TheGlobalEconomy.com |date=2017 |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Historical GDP growth of the Philippines.png|thumb|300px|Historical growth of the Philippine economy from 1961–2015]]
The Philippine economy has been growing steadily over decades and the International Monetary Fund in 2014 reported it as the 39th largest economy in the world. However its growth has been behind that of many of its Asian neighbors, the so-called [[Four Asian Tigers|Asian Tigers]], and it is not a part of the [[Group of 20]] nations. Instead it is grouped in a second tier for [[emerging markets]] or [[Newly industrialized country|newly industrialized countries]]. Depending on the analyst, this second tier can go by the name the [[Jim O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Gatley#Next Eleven|Next Eleven]] or the [[Tiger Cub Economies]].

In the years 2012 and 2013, the Philippines posted high GDP growth rates, reaching 6.8% in 2012 and 7.2% in 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nscb.gov.ph/sna/2013/4th2013/2013qpr4.asp|title=Philippine Economy Grew by 7.2 percent in 2013|accessdate=March 12, 2014|publisher=National Statistical Coordination Board|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312212817/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/sna/2013/4th2013/2013qpr4.asp|archivedate=March 12, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Asia News Network">{{cite web|url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/philippine-economy-grows-stunning-7-8-035003196.html;_ylt=And_vSsTuTZKHC1wcZVMrbHhV8d_;_ylu=X3oDMTJwdWRrbjhxBG1pdANJQiBtb2R1bGUEcGtnAzhiNDM4YWQyLTNmZTctM2NhMS1iYjE0LWJmMmU4Njg3MTMzMgRwb3MDbDMEc2VjA21lZGlhaW5maW5pdGVicm93c2VsaXN0;_ylg=X3oDMTJqMTc1YzcyBGludGwDcGgEbGFuZwNlbi1waARwc3RhaWQDZDNhZTkwNjYtNDVlZi0zMGU4LWI5ZGYtZTg0Nzc3Njk2Mzk5BHBzdGNhdAMEcHQDc3RvcnlwYWdl;_ylv=3|title=Philippine economy grows a stunning 7.8%|accessdate=June 6, 2013|publisher=Asia News Network|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204050712/http://ph.news.yahoo.com/philippine-economy-grows-stunning-7-8-035003196.html%3B_ylt%3DAnd_vSsTuTZKHC1wcZVMrbHhV8d_%3B_ylu%3DX3oDMTJwdWRrbjhxBG1pdANJQiBtb2R1bGUEcGtnAzhiNDM4YWQyLTNmZTctM2NhMS1iYjE0LWJmMmU4Njg3MTMzMgRwb3MDbDMEc2VjA21lZGlhaW5maW5pdGVicm93c2VsaXN0%3B_ylg%3DX3oDMTJqMTc1YzcyBGludGwDcGgEbGFuZwNlbi1waARwc3RhaWQDZDNhZTkwNjYtNDVlZi0zMGU4LWI5ZGYtZTg0Nzc3Njk2Mzk5BHBzdGNhdAMEcHQDc3RvcnlwYWdl%3B_ylv%3D3|archivedate=December 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/05/29/13/2012-ph-gdp-growth-revised-68-pct|title=2012 PH GDP growth revised to 6.8 pct |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |publisher=ABS-CBN News}}</ref> the highest GDP growth rates in [[Asia]] for the first two quarters of 2013, followed by [[China]] and [[Indonesia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/417531/philippines-is-fastest-growing-asian-country-for-first-quarter-of-2013|title=Philippines is fastest growing Asian country for first quarter of 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |publisher=Inquirer News}}</ref>

Philippine gold, nickel, copper, palladium and chromite deposits are among the largest in the world. Other important minerals include silver, coal, gypsum, and sulphur. Significant deposits of clay, limestone, marble, silica, and phosphate exist.

About 60% of total mining production are accounted for by non-metallic minerals, which contributed substantially to the industry's steady output growth between 1993 and 1998, with the value of production growing 58%. In 1999, however, mineral production declined 16% to $793 million.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Mineral exports have generally slowed since 1996. Led by copper cathodes, Philippine mineral exports amounted to $650 million in 2000, barely up from 1999 levels. Low metal prices, high production costs, lack of investment in infrastructure, and a challenge to the new mining law have contributed to the mining
industry's overall decline.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The industry rebounded starting in late 2004 when the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of an important law permitting foreign ownership of Philippines mining companies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  However, the DENR has yet to approve the revised Department Administrative Order (DAO) that will provide the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Financial and Technical Assistance Agreement (FTAA), the specific part of the 1994 Mining Act that allows 100% foreign ownership of Philippines mines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 2012, BPO sector employment ballooned to over 700,000 people and is contributing to a growing [[middle class]]. BPO facilities are concentrated in IT parks and centers in Economic Zones across the Philippines.<ref>Philippine Economic Zone Authority.{{cite web|url=http://www.peza.gov.ph/index.php/2-uncategorised/41-information-technology-parks-centers/|title=Information Technology Parks/Centers|accessdate=July 4, 2019}}</ref> BPO facilities are located mainly in [[Metro Manila]] and [[Cebu City]] although other regional areas such as [[Baguio]], [[Bacolod]], [[Cagayan de Oro]], [[Clark Freeport Zone]], [[Dagupan]], [[Davao City]], [[Dumaguete]], [[Lipa, Batangas|Lipa]], [[Iloilo City]], and [[Naga City, Camarines Sur]] are now being promoted and developed for BPO operations.

[[Call centers]] began in the Philippines as plain providers of email response and managing services and is now a major source of employment. Call center services include customer relations, ranging from travel services, technical support, education, customer care, financial services, online business to customer support, and online business-to-business support. [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) is regarded as one of the fastest growing industries in the world. The Philippines is also considered as a location of choice due to its many outsourcing benefits such as less expensive operational and labor costs, the high proficiency in spoken [[English language|English]] of a significant number of its people, and a highly educated labor pool. In 2011, the business process outsourcing industry in the Philippines generated 700 thousand jobs<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/03/21/12/bpo-industry-generate-100000-jobs-year-wb|title=BPO industry to generate 100,000 jobs this year: WB|first=By Cathy Rose A.

BPOs and the call center industry in general are also credited for the Philippines' recent economic growth resulting in investment status upgrades from credit ratings agencies such as Fitch and S&P.<ref name="King del Rosario"/>

With the Philippines being the 34th largest economy in the world, the country continues to be a promising prospect for the BPO Industry. Just in August 2014, the Philippines hit an all-time high for employment in the BPO industry.  From 101,000 workers in 2004, the labor force in the industry has grown to over 930,000 in just the first quarter of 2014.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title = The Philippines – Poised for Growth Through BPO|url = http://trendline.dcrworkforce.com/the-philippines-poised-for-growth-through-bpo.html|website = trendline.dcrworkforce.com|accessdate = November 10, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117021050/http://trendline.dcrworkforce.com/the-philippines-poised-for-growth-through-bpo.html|archive-date = November 17, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>

Growth in the BPO industry continues to show significant improvements with an average annual expansion rate of 20%. Figures have shown that from $1.3 Billion in 2004, export revenues from the BPO sector has increased to over $13.1 Billion in 2013. The IT and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP) also projects that the sector will have an expected total revenue of $25 Billion in 2016.<ref name=":5" /> IBPAP projects that the industry will employ 1.8 million workers and generate US$38.9 billion of revenue by 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itbpm-roadmap2022.ibpap.org/|title=Accelerate PH:Future-Ready Roadmap 2022–The Philippine IT-BPM Sector–Executive Summary|date=2016|publisher=Frost&Sullivan and IBPAP|accessdate=July 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706054319/http://www.itbpm-roadmap2022.ibpap.org/|archive-date=July 6, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

This growth in the industry is further promoted by the Philippine government. The industry is highlighted by the Philippines Development Plan as among the 10 high potential and priority development areas. To further entice investors, government programs include different incentives such as tax holidays, tax exemptions, and simplified export and import procedures. Additionally, training is also available for BPO applicants.<ref name=":5" />

===Tourism===
