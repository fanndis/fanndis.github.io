The '''Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act''' ({{USStatute|112|105|126|291|2012|04|04|S|2038}}) is an [[Act of Congress]] designed to combat [[insider trading]]. It was signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] on April 4, 2012. The law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees. It confirms changes to the [[Commodity Exchange Act]], specifies reporting intervals for financial transactions.

After a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on congressional insider trading in 2011, Republican Senator [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] and Democratic Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] introduced bills to combat the practice. In February 2012, the STOCK Act passed in the [[US Senate|Senate]] by a 96–3 vote; the only no votes were senators [[Jeff Bingaman]], [[Richard Burr]], and [[Tom Coburn]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Scott|title=STOCK Act passes Senate by vote of 96-3|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72391.html|accessdate=5 April 2012|newspaper=[[Politico]]|date=2 February 2012}}</ref> Later the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed it by a 417–2 vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll047.xml |title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 47 |date=February 9, 2012}}</ref> The bill was supported heavily by vulnerable incumbents and signed into law by President Obama.<ref>{{cite news|last=Blake|first=Aaron|title=The STOCK Act: Refuge of the most vulnerable congressmen in America|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-stock-act-refuge-of-the-most-vulnerable-congressmen-in-america/2012/04/05/gIQAEYhrxS_blog.html|accessdate=5 April 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=4 April 2012}}</ref> According to the current [[United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics]], "A member, officer, or employee of the Senate shall not receive any compensation, nor shall he permit any compensation to accrue to his beneficial interest from any source, the receipt or accrual of which would occur by virtue of influence improperly exerted from his position as a member, officer, or employee."<ref>{{cite web|title=Senate Ethics Rule 37|url=http://ethics.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=efa7bf74-4a50-46a5-bb6f-b8d26b9755bf#page=22|accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>

== About STOCK ==

The STOCK Act is an original bill to prohibit members of Congress and employees of Congress from using private information derived from their official positions for personal benefit, and for other purposes. With this bill in place, members of Congress are no longer allowed to use information garnered through official business for personal reasons. The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act prohibits members and employees of Congress from using "any nonpublic information derived from the individual's position ... or gained from performance of the individual's duties, for personal benefit". The bill also applies to all employees in the Executive and Judicial branches of the federal government. The STOCK Act requires a one-year study of the growing political intelligence industry, and requires every Member of Congress to publicly file and disclose any financial transaction of stocks, bond, commodities futures, and other securities within 45 days on their websites, rather than once a year as they do now. The Act also requires members of Congress and Executive branch officials to disclose the terms of mortgages on their homes, prohibits them from receiving special access to initial public stock offerings, and denies federal pensions to members of Congress who are convicted of felonies involving public corruption. The bill is divided into nineteen sections.<ref name=Procon.org>{{cite web|title=What is the STOCK Act?|url=http://insidertrading.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004520}}</ref>

== Reception ==

Overall the STOCK Act has garnered positive support from both houses of Congress. STOCK will effectively put an end to congressional insider trading{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. However, guarded optimism has been expressed by politicians such as Eric Weissmann. Weissman, a candidate for Congress in Colorado's 2nd Congressional District, recently claimed that STOCK was long overdue and that "The passage of the STOCK Act by both the House and Senate is a good first step in deterring these abusive practices, but doesn't go far enough to protect the American people from members of Congress who chose to act with self-interest over public good."<ref>{{cite web|title=Eric Weissman|url=http://ericweissmann.com/_blog/News/post/Eric_Weissmann_Statement_on_the_Passage_of_the_STOCK_Act/}}</ref>

Other examples of positive support for STOCK include President Obama who upon signing the bill reassured that congressional members must play by the same rules as regular citizens. Obama regards the STOCK act as a way to monitor congressional activity and create transparency within the branch. He spoke to this point by adding, "It's the notion that the powerful shouldn't get to create one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else. ... If we expect that to apply to our biggest corporations and our most successful citizens, it certainly should apply to our elected officials."<ref>{{cite news|title=Obama signs STOCK|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/04/obama-signs-stock-act_n_1402669.html | work=Huffington Post | date=April 4, 2012}}</ref>

==Amendment==
The STOCK Act was modified on April 15, 2013, by S.716. This amendment modifies the online disclosure portion of the STOCK Act, so that some officials, but not the President, Vice President, Congress, or anyone running for Congress, can no longer file online and their records are no longer easily accessible to the public. In Section (a)2, the amendment specifically does not alter the online access for trades by the President, the Vice President, Congress, or those running for Congress.<ref>{{cite web|title=A bill to modify the requirements under the STOCK Act regarding online access to certain financial disclosure statements and related forms.|date=2013-04-15|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:s.716:|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref> The reasoning for this change was to prevent criminals from gaining access to the financial data and using it against affected persons. This bill was introduced by Senator [[Harry Reid]] on April 11, 2013. It was considered by the Senate  and passed by [[unanimous consent]]. In the house, S.716 received only 14 seconds of discussion before being passed by unanimous consent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congress quietly repeals plan for Internet financial disclosures|author1=Lowder, D. |author2=Cowan, R. |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/12/net-us-usa-congress-security-idUSBRE93B0ZJ20130412|newspaper=Reuters|date=April 12, 2013|accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

The main provision that was repealed would have required about 28,000 senior government officials to post their financial information online, something that had been strongly criticized by federal government employee unions. A report by the [[National Academy of Public Administration (United States)|National Academy of Public Administration]], published in March 2013, said that the provision could threaten the safety of government employees abroad, as well as make it difficult to attract and retain public sector employees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/293919-obama-signs-stock-act-step-back|title=Obama signs STOCK Act modification|last=Schroeder|first=Peter|date=2013-04-15|website=TheHill|language=en|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>

The amendment also eliminated the requirement for the creation of searchable, sortable database of information in reports, and the requirement that reports be done in electronic format, rather than on paper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2013/04/action-alert-stock-act-reversal-signed/|title=Action Alert: STOCK Act Reversal Signed by President|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|date=2013-04-15|website=OpenSecrets News|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-23|last3=|first3=|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
