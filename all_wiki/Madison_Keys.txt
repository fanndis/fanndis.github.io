'''Madison Keys''' (born February 17, 1995) is an American professional [[tennis]] player. She achieved a career-high ranking of No. 7 in the world in October 2016 and has been consistently ranked inside the top 25 by the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) since early 2015. Keys has played in one [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament final at the [[2017 US Open (tennis)|2017 US Open]], competed at the [[2016 WTA Finals]], and was a semifinalist at the [[Tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's Singles|2016 Summer Olympics]]. She has won five WTA tournaments, all at the [[WTA Premier Tournaments|Premier]] level. Her biggest title came at the [[2019 Western & Southern Open|2019 Cincinnati Open]], a Premier 5 event.

Known for having a fast serve and one of the most powerful forehands in the game, Keys has used her aggressive playing style to become one of the leaders of the next generation of American tennis alongside [[Sloane Stephens]], [[CoCo Vandeweghe]], and [[Sofia Kenin]]. She debuted in the top 10 of the WTA rankings in 2016, becoming the first American woman to realize this milestone since [[Serena Williams]] seventeen years earlier. When Keys and Stephens faced off against each other in the [[2017 US Open – Women's Singles|2017 US Open]] final, they snapped a streak of no American women aside from the [[Williams sisters]] appearing in a Grand Slam singles final since 2005. Keys has also had success on all surfaces, winning at least one title on each and having reached at least the quarterfinal stage of all four Grand Slam tournaments.

Keys was inspired to start playing tennis after seeing the dresses [[Venus Williams]] was wearing at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] on TV. Originally from the [[Quad Cities]] in [[Illinois]], she moved to [[Florida]] to train at the Evert Tennis Academy. Her coaches regarded her as a prodigy and believed she had a good chance to win a major title. Keys turned pro on her 14th birthday and quickly showed her potential by becoming one of the youngest players to win a WTA Tour level match a few months later. She also won a [[World TeamTennis]] exhibition set against then world No. 2 Serena Williams later that year. Keys first cracked the top 100 of the WTA rankings in 2013 at the age of 17. She had her first big breakthrough at a major in early 2015 when she reached the semifinals of the [[2015 Australian Open|Australian Open]] as a teenager.

==Early life and background==
Keys was born on February 17, 1995 in [[Rock Island, Illinois|Rock Island]], one of the [[Quad Cities]] in northwestern [[Illinois]]. Her parents Rick and Christine are both attorneys, and her father was also a Division III All-American college basketball player at [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]].<ref name="home-court">{{cite web |title=Advantage Q-C: Tennis star Madison Keys returns this week to her home courts |url=http://qctimes.com/news/local/advantage-q-c-tennis-star-madison-keys-returns-this-week/article_ab7af3ab-59f3-5163-8bd3-b92109da0445.html |website=Quad City Times |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref> She has an older sister named Sydney and two younger sisters named Montana and Hunter, none of whom play tennis.<ref name="rolling-stone">{{cite web |title=Madison Keys: Tennis' Next Big Thing Kills 'Em With Kindness |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/madison-keys-tennis-next-big-thing-kills-em-with-kindness-20150309 |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> Keys's passion for tennis started at a young age. Her interest in the sport arose from watching [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] on television when she was four years old. Keys asked her parents for a white tennis dress like the one [[Venus Williams]] was wearing, and they offered to get her one if she started playing tennis. Her father said that after this bargain, "All [Madison] did was try to hit balls into the next yard — home runs."<ref name=nytimes-usopen2011 /><ref name=wta-profile>{{cite web |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/16049/title/madison-keys |title=Madison Keys profile |publisher=WTA|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref>

Keys started playing tennis at the Quad-City Tennis Club in [[Moline, Illinois|Moline]].<ref name="moline">{{cite web |title=Madison Keys returns home after breakthrough performance |url=https://qctimes.com/sports/madison-keys-returns-home-after-breakthrough-performance/article_67611f2a-6931-5c5f-a56a-50e75e1f87cd.html |website=Quad City Times |accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> She began taking lessons regularly at seven and began competing in tournaments at the age of nine. When she was ten years old, she moved to Florida with her mother and younger sisters so that she could train at the [[Evert Tennis Academy]] founded by John Evert and also partly run by his sister, International Tennis Hall of Famer [[Chris Evert]].<ref name="espn-rise">{{cite web |title=Madison Keys: Young Money |url=http://madisonkeys.com/news.htm |website=ESPN Rise (via Madison Keys) |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref><ref name="play-tennis" /> At first, John said that he "thought she was very athletic, a raw talent physically. She definitely needed to be cleaned up with her strokes." Keys noted that her game was very different when she was starting out at the academy compared to how it is as a pro, saying, "I didn't like groundstrokes, I didn't like long points that much, so I would just run into the net and try and volley."<ref name="play-tennis">{{cite web |title=The Making of a Pro: Florida's 13-Year-old Star Madison Keys |url=http://www.tennis-x.com/ptfstory/2008-03-30/627.php |website=Play Tennis Florida Magazine |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref> Nonetheless, Keys's coaches had high hopes for her.<ref name=nytimes-usopenloss /> Chris said, "At 12 years old, she's pretty much an all-court player; she's not one-dimensional, which is pretty rare in this day and age."<ref name="play-tennis" /><ref name = "home">{{cite web|title=Madison Keys: Teen Tennis Pro|url=http://homeschoolingteen.com/article/madison-keys-teen-tennis-pro/|website=Homeschooling Teen|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}</ref>

==Junior career==
When Keys was 12 years old, she went 23–2 in her girls 12s matches, including a perfect 19–0 in 2007.<ref name="core-tennis">{{cite web |title=Madison Keys |url=https://www.coretennis.net/tennis-player/madison-keys/9116/stats.html |website=Core Tennis |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref> Her most notable title was a victory at the 12-and-under [[Junior Orange Bowl (tennis)|Junior Orange Bowl]].<ref name=play-tennis /> At the age of 13, Keys began competing in 18-and-under ITF events. In January 2009, she won the [[Copa del Café]], a high-level Grade 1 tournament in [[Costa Rica]], to become the first American winner of the girls' event in its 26-year history.<ref name="coffee">{{cite web |title=Copa del Café esconde su gloria para Costa Rica |url=https://semanariouniversidad.com/deportes/copa-del-cafe-esconde-gloria-costa-rica/ |website=Semanario Universidad |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref> Later that year, her coach John Evert remarked that, "She's got weapons at a very young age. Most of the top players in the world have weapons, but it takes some time to develop them. Madison at the age of 14 can hit her serve or her forehand as big as most of the girls, and some of the top girls, on the pro tour."<ref name="qc-youngest">{{cite web |title=Former Q-C girl has potential to win grand slams |url=http://qctimes.com/sports/former-q-c-girl-has-potential-to-win-grand-slams/article_06fcfeb2-5881-11de-a8be-001cc4c03286.html |website=Quad City Times |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref>

As a 15-year-old, Keys played in just five ITF Junior events, instead opting to play in eight ITF Pro Circuit events over the same period.<ref name="itf-junior-activity">{{cite web |title=Madison Keys Activity |url=https://www.itftennis.com/juniors/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100133824 |website=ITF |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref><ref name="pan-american" /> Her best result that year was winning both the singles and doubles titles at the Grade B1 Pan American Closed ITF Championships, which is the highest level of regional tournament on the junior tour.<ref name="pan-american">{{cite web |title=Peliwo Takes ITF B1 Pan American Closed Boys Singles Championship; Keys Sweeps Girls Singles and Doubles |url=http://tenniskalamazoo.blogspot.com/2010/10/peliwo-takes-itf-b1-pan-american-closed.html |website=ZooTennis.com |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref> After the [[2011 US Open – Girls' Singles|2011 US Open]], Keys moved to the pro tour full-time. She was ranked No. 16 in the ITF junior rankings at the time, a personal best. At this stage of her career, she was already 5' 10", serving at {{convert|115|mph}}, and could hit strong forehand and backhand winners.<ref name="nytimes-usopen2011">{{cite web |title=As Williamses Age, Here Comes Youth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/sports/tennis/madison-keys-is-among-us-youngsters-following-williams-sisters.html |website=New York Times |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref>

During her early years, Keys played mostly on the ITF Circuit, where she won three titles in singles and one in doubles. Her next opportunity to play on the WTA Tour came in March 2011, when she was awarded a wild card into the [[2011 Sony Ericsson Open|Miami Open]]. Keys was defeated by No. 41 [[Patty Schnyder]] in the first round, despite having a chance to serve for the match.<ref name="patty">{{cite web |title=Patty Schnyder souffre mais passe à Miami |url=https://www.rts.ch/sport/tennis/dames/3034367-patty-schnyder-souffre-mais-passe-a-miami.html |website=RTS Sport |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref> Several months later, Keys won an invitational playoff to earn one of the American wild card spots in the main draw of the [[2011 US Open (tennis)|US Open]].<ref name="wc-playoff">{{cite web |title=Keys to make major tennis debut at U.S. Open |url=http://qctimes.com/sports/keys-to-make-major-tennis-debut-at-u-s-open/article_e069079a-cc29-11e0-8043-001cc4c03286.html |website=Quad City Times |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref> She defeated fellow American [[Jill Craybas]] in her Grand Slam tournament debut to become the youngest match winner at the event in six years at the age of 16.<ref name="usopen2011">{{cite web |title=Madison Keys, 16, Beats Jill Craybas, 37, In US Open 1st Round |url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/08/29/madison-keys-16-beats-jill-craybas-37-in-us-open-1st-round/ |website=CBS New York |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref> Keys also won an [[2012 Australian Open – Main Draw Wildcard Entries#US Playoffs - Women|invitational playoff]] to compete at the [[2012 Australian Open]] but was unable to get past the first round.<ref name="ausopen2012">{{cite web |title=Keys, Levine win Aus Open wildcards |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/keys-levine-win-aus-open-wildcards-20111219-1p1x7.html |website=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref>

Keys had a relatively quiet stretch following Wimbledon. In October, she finished her season at the [[2013 HP Open|Japan Women's Open]] in [[Osaka]], where she reached her first WTA semifinal.

Before the beginning of the season, Keys had surgery to repair her injured left wrist, which she hurt over a year earlier at the 2015 US Open. She was aware of the injury in the middle of 2016 and was planning on having surgery after the 2016 US Open.

After returning to her former coach Juan Todero, she won her first career WTA clay court title at the [[2019 Volvo Car Open|Charleston Open]].

Despite entering the [[2019 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati Open]] in August on a three-match losing streak, and having won multiple matches at just three events all season, Keys won the tournament for her first Premier 5 title, and the fifth of her career. She upset No. 4 and reigning Wimbledon champion Simona Halep in the third round, having lost five consecutive matches against the Romanian, before defeating [[Venus Williams]] in the quarterfinals and [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] in the final.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keys snaps skid against Halep to reach Cincy QF: ' I just played...within myself' |url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/keys-snaps-skid-against-halep-reach-cincy-qf |website=WTA Tennis |accessdate=18 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=McGrogan |first1=Ed |title=Madison Keys beats Svetlana Kuznetsova to win Cincinnati |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2019/08/watch-madison-keys-beats-svetlana-kuznetsova-win-cincinnati/84465/ |website=Tennis.com |accessdate=18 August 2019}}</ref> With the title, Keys returned to the top 10 for the first time since June 2018.<ref name=wta-rankings/> At her next two tournaments, Keys won multiple matches as well.

===2020: Brisbane final===
Keys started the season strongly by reaching the final at the [[2020 Brisbane International - Singles|Brisbane International]], her first career final during the early hard court season. She defeated former Grand Slam champions [[Samantha Stosur]] and [[Petra Kvitová]] en route before falling to [[Karolína Plíšková]] in a tight three-set match. Seeded tenth at the [[2020 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]], Keys recorded straight set victories [[Daria Kasatkina]] and [[Arantxa Rus]] in her first two matches but fell to 20th seed [[Maria Sakkari]] in the third round.

Keys did not play the rest of the early hard-court season and was next scheduled to play in [[2020 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]], but play was suspended before the tournament began due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. When the tour resumed in August, Keys made her return at the [[2020 Western & Southern Open – Women's Singles|Western & Southern Open]] where she was the defending champion. However, she lost her opening match to [[Ons Jabeur]] in the second round after receiving a bye in the first. Due to several of the top 10 players withdrawing from the [[2020 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]] citing safety concerns, Keys was seeded 7th and considered a serious contender for the title. She breezed through her first two matches, winning in straight sets over [[Tímea Babos]] and [[Aliona Bolsova]]. Unfortunately in the third round, after losing the first-set tiebreak and serving at 2–3 in the second set against [[Alizé Cornet]], Keys was forced to retire from the match due to a neck injury, marking her earliest exit from the US Open since [[2014 US Open – Women's Singles#Section 3|2014]], snapping a streak of five consecutive runs to the second week. She recovered in time to play at the [[2020 French Open – Women's Singles#Section 7|French Open]], where she was seeded twelfth. However she was upset in the first round by [[Zhang Shuai]] in straight sets, marking the first time Keys lost in the opening round at a major since the [[2014 French Open – Women's Singles|2014 French Open]].

==Rivalries==
===Keys vs. Venus and Serena===
Keys regarded [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]] as two of her childhood idols.<ref name="play-tennis" /> She has also frequently been labeled as a potential successor to the Williams sisters to lead American women's tennis.<ref name="successor2013">{{cite web |title=Australian Open: Madison Keys gives America hope of successor to Venus |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/16/australian-open-madison-keys-venus-williams |website=The Guardian |accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name="successor2015">{{cite web |title=Evert, McEnroe Tab Keys As Post-Williams Wimbledon Successor |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/06/evert-mcenroe-tab-keys-post-williams-wimbledon-successor/55336/ |website=Tennis.com |accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name="successor2017">{{cite web |title=US women's tennis finally has worthy successors to Serena and Venus |url=https://nypost.com/2017/09/07/us-womens-tennis-finally-has-worthy-successors-to-serena-and-venus/ |website=New York Post |accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> Keys has never beaten Serena in three attempts but she does have a 3–2 record against Venus.<ref name="serena-h2h">{{cite web |title=Madison Keys vs Serena Williams Head-to-Head |url=https://matchstat.com/en/tennis/h2h-odds-bets/Serena%20Williams/Madison%20Keys |website=Match Stat |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}</ref><ref name=venus-h2h>{{cite web |title=Madison Keys vs Venus Williams Head-to-Head |url=https://matchstat.com/en/tennis/h2h-odds-bets/Venus%20Williams/Madison%20Keys |website=Match Stat |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}</ref>

Keys first played Venus in the semifinals of the [[2013 Family Circle Cup|2013 Charleston Open]], where Venus won a tight match against an 18-year-old Keys. Their next encounter occurred in Keys's breakthrough tournament, the [[2015 Australian Open]]. Keys won their quarterfinal match in three sets, overcoming a lower back injury in the second set. Venus won their next match loss later in the year at the [[2015 WTA Elite Trophy|WTA Elite Trophy]], where she won the title. Keys has won their most recent two encounters at the [[2016 Rogers Cup|2016 Canadian Open]] and the [[2019 Western & Southern Open|2019 Cincinnati Open]].<ref name=venus-h2h />

Keys's first match against Serena came right after her first victory over Venus at the 2015 Australian Open. Serena was able to end Keys's run in the semifinals but offered high praise for her opponent.<ref name="serena-praise" /> At the [[2015 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] later that year, she beat Keys at a Grand Slam tournament yet again. Their most recent meeting took place in the final of the Italian Open, the first Premier 5 final of Keys's career. Keys entered the match as an underdog, given that Serena had a 15 match win streak against other Americans, and had not lost to another American in a final since [[2008 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] in 2008 against her sister.<ref name="serena-keys-rome">{{cite web |title=10 Things To Know: Serena Vs Keys |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/10-things-know-serena-vs-keys |website=WTA Tennis |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}</ref> Serena preserved both of those streaks with a straight sets win.<ref name="serena-h2h" />

===Keys vs. Stephens and Vandeweghe===
Keys is close friends with [[Sloane Stephens]] and [[CoCo Vandeweghe]], creating a friendly rivalry between the three of them.

Keys has struggled against Stephens, often hitting more unforced errors than usual in their matches. These miscues have resulted from Stephens being able to counteract Keys's powerful groundstrokes while also supplying power to her own shots.<ref name="economist">{{cite web |title=Sloane Stephens shows you don't have to be aggressive to win a major |url=https://www.economist.com/game-theory/2017/09/12/sloane-stephens-shows-you-dont-have-to-be-aggressive-to-win-a-major |website=The Economist |accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name=stephens-style /> Keys and Stephens first played in the first round at the [[2015 Miami Open]], which Stephens won in straight sets.

===Keys vs. Kerber and Halep===
Out of all the players who have been ranked [[List of WTA number 1 ranked tennis players|world No. 1]], Keys has most frequently faced off against [[Angelique Kerber]] and [[Simona Halep]]. Both Kerber and Halep have been effective at using their counter-punching style to neutralize Keys's power.<ref name="kerber-style" /><ref name="halep-style">{{cite web |title=WTA Finals: Madison Keys overwhelmed by Simona Halep in Singapore |url=https://www.thenational.ae/sport/tennis/wta-finals-madison-keys-overwhelmed-by-simona-halep-in-singapore-1.660131 |website=The National |accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> As a result, she does not have a good record against either of them, going 2–8 against Kerber and 2–5 against Halep.<ref name="kerber-h2h">{{cite web |title=Keys vs. Kerber Head to Head |url=https://matchstat.com/en/tennis/h2h-odds-bets/Angelique%20Kerber/Madison%20Keys |website=Match Stat |accessdate=August 19, 2018}}</ref><ref name="halep-h2h">{{cite web |title=Keys vs. Halep |url=https://matchstat.com/en/tennis/h2h-odds-bets/Simona%20Halep/Madison%20Keys |website=Match Stat |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}</ref> Many of these encounters have taken place in important tournaments. Both Kerber and Halep defeated Keys in the round robin stage of the [[2016 WTA Finals]] to prevent her from advancing to the semifinals.

Keys' first victory over Kerber came in the final of the [[2014 Aegon International|2014 Eastbourne International]] to give Keys her first ever WTA title. This was their third meeting. Since this victory, Keys notably lost to Kerber in the final of the [[2015 Family Circle Cup|2015 Charleston Open]], the semifinals at the [[Tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Rio Olympics]], and the quarterfinals at the [[2018 Australian Open]].<ref name="kerber-h2h" /> In particular, Keys would have won a medal had she defeated Kerber at the Olympics but ended up finishing in fourth place just off the podium.<ref name=rio2016/> She snapped her five-match losing streak to Kerber in 2018 with a come-from-behind three-set win in the third round of the [[2018 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati Open]].<ref name=kerber-cincinnati/>

Keys won her first-ever meeting with Halep at the [[2014 Apia International Sydney|2014 Sydney International]], losing only five games after previously being on verge of demolishing Halep at 6–1, 5–0.  Following this match, she lost her next five matches against Halep, including the fourth round at [[2014 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] and the final of the [[2016 Rogers Cup|Canadian Open]], both of which were contested in 2016. Keys ended her losing streak to Halep in the third round of the [[2019 Western & Southern Open|2019 Cincinnati Open]], winning in three sets en route to winning her first Premier 5 title.<ref name="halep-h2h" />

===Keys vs. Muguruza and Osaka===
By contrast with her bad head-to-head record against counter-punchers Kerber and Halep, she has managed so far to play better against hard-hitters with similar game style as her, [[Garbiñe Muguruza]] and [[Naomi Osaka]], leading to 4–1 record against Muguruza and 3–1 against Osaka. Both of them have won multiple Grand Slams and former world No. 1s, but have yet failed to resist against the power of Keys' groundstrokes in most of their matches.

Keys and Muguruza played a lot of competitive matches, as there was at least one tie-break in all matches but one. Nevertheless, it was Keys who prevailed in most of those matches. Keys won in straight sets their most important meeting at semifinals of premier 5 tournament at [[2016 Italian Open]],<ref>{{cite web |title=WILLIAMS TO FACE KEYS IN ROME FINAL |url=https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2016/05/in-rome-murray-advances-to-2nd-straight-clay-court-final/58483/ |website=tennis.com |accessdate=January 24, 2020}}</ref> and also another semifinals at [[2017 Bank of the West Classic]], which was their fastest match so far, as Keys lost only five games. The latter was a significant win for Keys as Muguruza was playing her first tournament since winning [[2017 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Keys knocks out reigning Wimbledon champion Muguruza for Stanford final spot |url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/1417454/keys-knocks-out-muguruza-for-stanford-final-spot |website=wtatennis.com |accessdate=January 24, 2020}}</ref> Muguruza won the next match at [[2017 Western & Southern Open|2017 Cincinnati Open]] only two weeks later, after Keys served for the match and missed two match points. Two years later at the [[2019 Western & Southern Open|same tournament]], Keys won after a big three-set battle and went on to win the title. 

First match against Osaka at the [[2016 US Open (tennis)|2016 US Open]] came when Osaka was still a teenager, while two-years-older Keys was more experienced having already reached Major semifinals and top 10. In the end, experience turned out to be a key for the win, as Madison found herself down 1–5 in third set, but won the next five games and eventually won the tie-break to progress to the fourth round.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tennis - Keys claims dramatic comeback win over tearful Osaka |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-open-keys/tennis-keys-claims-dramatic-comeback-win-over-tearful-osaka-idUSKCN1182KH |website=Reuters |accessdate=January 24, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DOWN 5-1 IN THIRD SET, MADISON KEYS STORMS BACK TO STUN NAOMI OSAKA IN THIRD ROUND |url=https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2016/09/naomi-osaka-madison-keys-us-open-tennis/60554/ |website=tennis.com |accessdate=January 24, 2020}}</ref> Keys went on to win much easier in straigh sets their next two matches at [[2017 BNP Paribas Open]] and [[2018 French Open]], even though in the latter Osaka was in a little bit better form at the time and also recent [[2018 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]] champion.

==Playing style==
[[File:Madison Keys serving at Birmingham (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Keys serving]]
Keys has described her own game as "I have a pretty good serve and a pretty good forehand, but what people notice the most is how hard I can hit the ball and how much power is behind my shots."<ref name="vogue">{{cite web |title=Madison Keys, a Rising Star on the Tennis Court and Beyond |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/madison-keys-interview-us-open-gender-inequality |website=Vogue |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref> She has been listed at 5' 10" since she was 14 years old, which helped her play in pro events from a young age.<ref name="qc-youngest"/> She has used her tall frame to develop a style of play around hitting big serves and powerful groundstrokes on both the forehand and backhand sides. Keys's junior coach [[Chris Evert]] compared her level of power at 18 years old to that of [[Serena Williams]], saying "I can almost say she almost matches Serena [Williams'] serve as far as power. Out of all the players out there, she comes the closest to Serena's serve. The power off both sides is tremendous for someone that young."<ref name="serena-comp">{{cite web |title=Madison Keys shows star power |url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/9432680/2013-wimbledon-madison-keys-shows-star-power |website=espnW |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref> Keys is particularly known for hitting strong forehand groundstrokes. Former world No. 1 [[Karolína Plíšková]], who also has an elite forehand, and 2017 US Open champion [[Sloane Stephens]] have both said that Keys has the best forehand in the game.<ref name="best-forehand">{{cite web |title=Who's got the best forehand?

Keys is an aggressive baseliner. She does not go to the net too often, instead relying on her power to hit forehand and backhand winners to end points.<ref>{{cite web |title=Madison Keys Bio |url=http://www.tennis.com/player/724/madison-keys/bio/ |website=Tennis.com |accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref> The Aggression Score metric, which measures a player's aggression based on how quickly they finish points, rated Keys among the top 10% of all players.<ref name=economist/> Keys's biggest weakness is her inability to control her power at times. Her match losses are often due to her opponents provoking her into hitting too many unforced errors while she is aiming for winners.<ref name="kerber-style"/><ref name=stephens-style/><ref name=rodina-style/><ref name=halep-style/>

[[File:Madison Keys backhand at Birmingham (cropped).jpg|thumb|Keys preparing to hit a backhand]]

Although Keys prefers playing on hard courts, where she reached her first Grand Slam final and won her first Premier 5 title, she has had success on all three main surfaces used on tour.<ref name=wta-profile /> Two out of her five WTA titles have come on grass courts. Her least favorite surface is clay, which is typically regarded as too slow to suit players like Keys whose style revolves around hitting with power.<ref name="second-wrist-surgery">{{cite web |title=Keys optimistic after second surgery ahead of Wimbledon |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/wta-insider-exclusive-keys-reveals-second-wrist-surgery-french-open-optimistic-for-wimbledon-2017 |website=WTA Tennis |accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name="slow-clay">{{cite web |title=As Season Shifts to Clay Courts, Madison Keys Finds Unexpected Success |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/sports/tennis/as-season-shifts-to-clay-courts-madison-keys-finds-unexpected-success.html |website=New York Times |accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref> Nonetheless, she has won one title on clay at the [[2019 Volvo Car Open|2019 Charleston Open]], reached one Premier 5 final on clay, and also made it to the semifinals at the [[French Open]].<ref name=italian-open-final/><ref name=stephens-style/>

Keys uses her strong serve to dominate her service games. In 2016, she finished third in percentage of points won on serve behind only Serena Williams and [[Victoria Azarenka]], among all players with at least ten tour-level matches.<ref name="wta-stats">{{cite web |title=WTA Statistics 2016 |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/stats |website=WTA Tennis |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref> That same year, she also hit the third-most aces with 300, trailing Serena who had 324 and Plíšková who led the tour with 530.<ref name="2016-ace-leaders">{{cite web |title=Top 3 Ace Leaders in 2016 |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/videos/top-3-ace-leaders-2016 |website=WTA Tennis |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref> Keys could serve at more than {{convert|100|mph}} when she was 14, and was clocked at up to {{convert|126|mph}} on the road to her first WTA title in 2014.<ref name="qc-youngest"/><ref name=first-title /> Although that serve is not recognized because there was no official serve speed data at the tournament, the WTA has recorded her serving at {{convert|124|mph}} at the US Open, which was good for the fifth fastest serve in 2015.<ref name="2015-serves">{{cite web |title=IDS Serve Speed Leaders |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/content/ids-serve-speed-leaders-0 |website=WTA Tennis |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref>

On multiple occasions, Keys has been recorded hitting groundstrokes at speeds that are comparable to, if not faster than the top men's tennis players. At the [[2014 French Open]], Keys had the fastest average groundstroke speed of any player at {{convert|78.9|mph}}. For comparison, [[Novak Djokovic]] had the fastest groundstrokes on the men's side with an average speed of {{convert|77.1|mph}}.<ref name="smash">{{cite web |title=Men's and women's tennis: as different as believed? |url=https://tennismash.com/2017/02/16/mens-womens-tennis-different-seem/ |website=TennisSmash |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref> The Game Insight Group analyzed Australian Open data over a five-year period from 2012 to 2016 and found that Keys had the second-fastest average forehand and backhand speeds of all players. Her {{convert|78.9|mph}} forehands trailed only [[Tomáš Berdych]], and her {{convert|72.8|mph}} backhands trailed only [[Li Na]]. Out of just her fastest 1% of shots, Keys hit an average forehand at {{convert|97.1|mph}}, which was stronger than [[Lleyton Hewitt]] and close to [[David Ferrer]]. Her fastest backhands had an average of {{convert|90.0|mph}}, which was faster than that of [[Bernard Tomic]] and close to [[Nick Kyrgios]], both of whom have a reputation for being able to hit powerful groundstrokes.<ref name="data-analytics">{{cite web |title=At the Australian Open, Tennis Joins Its Sports Brethren on a New Surface: Data Analytics |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/sports/tennis/australian-open-data.html?mcubz=1 |website=New York Times |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Backhand key to Bernard's success |url=http://www.bernardtomic.com/news/2012/backhand-key-to-bernard%E2%80%99s-success |website=Bernard Tomic |accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A Young Upstart With the Tools to Have Staying Power |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/sports/tennis/wimbledon-2014-nick-kyrgios-surprises-everyone-including-rafael-nadal.html |website=New York Times |accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref>

==Coaches==
When Keys was at the Evert Tennis Academy, she was primarily coached by John Evert. She also worked with his sister [[Chris Evert]], a member of the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]].<ref name=play-tennis /> In 2011 after six years at the academy, Keys switched coaches to [[Adam Peterson (tennis)|Adam Peterson]], who was assigned to work with her through the USTA. Peterson is better known as a long time coach of [[Lindsay Davenport]], who would also later coach Keys.<ref name="peterson">{{cite web |title=Time for a change, Keys has new coach |url=http://qctimes.com/sports/high-school/article_fb865856-73a1-11e0-a0f9-001cc4c03286.html |website=Quad City Times |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref> In her early pro career, Keys also worked with two other USTA coaches, Juan Todero and Jay Gooding, who helped her break into the Top 50 of the WTA rankings.<ref name="todero">{{cite web |title=Tennis greats expect great things from Madison Keys at Miami Open |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/tennis/article16215587.html |website=Miami Herald |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref>

Before the start of the 2015 season, Davenport and her husband Jon Leach joined Keys's coaching team.<ref name="first-davenport" /><ref name="leach" /> During this year, Keys also worked with doubles legend [[Lisa Raymond]].<ref name="raymond">{{cite web |title=Lisa Raymond is ready for life beyond playing |url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2015-09-03/lisa_raymond_is_ready_for_life_beyond_playing.html |website=US Open |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref> Despite a breakthrough season, Keys left all three at the end of the year in search of a coach who would be available for a more full-time role.<ref name="split-davenport-2015" /> In the first half of 2016, Keys hired [[Jesse Levine]] to coach her. During this period, she also worked with [[Mats Wilander]] for about a week, which amounted to little.<ref name="bye-levine" /> Near the start of the clay court season, Keys replaced Levine with [[Thomas Högstedt]].<ref name="start-hogstedt" /> With this partnership, Keys had a fantastic second half of the year that culminated in her debut at the [[WTA Finals]]. Nonetheless, Keys split with Högstedt after the season due to a "personality conflict." In spite of the split, Keys did believe that Högstedt helped her game a lot.<ref name="end-hogstedt" />

Keys reunited with Davenport at the beginning of 2017.<ref name="wrist-injury-2016" /> Midway through the year, she also started to work with [[Dieter Kindlmann]].<ref name="start-kindlmann">{{cite web |title=Keys 'managing expectations' alongside new coach Kindlmann |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/keys-managing-expectations-alongside-new-coach-kindlmann |website=WTA Tennis |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref> Although Keys struggled early in the season in part due to her comeback from wrist surgery, Davenport helped lead Keys to a third title and her first major final at the US Open later in the year.

Keys is biracial, as her mother is white and her father is African-American.

In February 2020, Keys relaunched Fearlessly Girl into a nonprofit organization called Kindness Wins. In its mission statement, the organization is described as "a platform for kindness, with special emphasis on kindness to self, kindness to youth and kindness to others in times of struggle." Kindness Wins looks to partner with other similarly minded groups, and to provide grants and support to people who are making the world a better place.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Maine |first1=D'Arcy |title=Madison Keys spreading kindness on and off the tennis court |url=https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/28702116/madison-keys-spreading-kindness-the-tennis-court |website=espn.com |accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Kindness Wins - Our Mission |url=https://kindnesswins.org/our-mission |website=kindnesswins.org |accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref>
