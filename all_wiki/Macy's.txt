'''Macy's''' (originally '''R. H. Macy & Co.''') is an American [[department store]] chain founded in 1858 by [[Rowland Hussey Macy]]. It became a division of the [[Cincinnati]]-based Federated Department Stores in 1994, through which it is affiliated with the [[Bloomingdale's]] department store chain; the holding company was renamed [[Macy's, Inc.]] in 2007. As of 2015, Macy's was the largest U.S. [[department store]] company by retail sales. As of August 1, 2020, there were 546 stores (607 boxes), including 11 flagships (16 boxes) and 384 magnets (429 boxes), for a total of 395 core stores (445 boxes), and 94 neighborhood stores (100 boxes, for a total of 546 full line stores), 48 furniture galleries (53 boxes), 2 furniture clearance centers, 6 freestanding Backstage stores and 1 Market by Macy's with the Macy's nameplate in operation throughout the United States.<ref name="storecount"/><ref name="storelocations">{{Cite web|url=https://content-az.equisolve.net/_3ba4468441186a12a12de5234adc2373/macysinc/files/files/store-locations.xlsx|title=Macy's Inc.

Macy's has conducted the annual [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in New York City since 1924 and has sponsored the city's annual [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] fireworks display since 1976. [[Macy's Herald Square]] is one of the largest department stores in the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/11/28/macys-herald-square-thanksgiving-shopping/19600941/|title=Record crowd shops Macy's Herald Square store|newspaper=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref> The flagship store covers almost an entire New York City block, features about 1.1 million square feet of retail space, includes additional space for offices and storage, and serves as the endpoint for the Thanksgiving Day parade.

==Early history==
===1800s===

{{See also|Macy's Herald Square}}
[[Rowland Hussey Macy]] opened four retail [[dry goods]] stores between 1843 and 1855. One of them was the original Macy's store in downtown [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]]; it opened in 1851 to serve the mill industry employees of the area. They all failed, but he learned from his mistakes. Macy moved to [[New York City]] in 1858, to establish a new store named "R. H. Macy & Co." on [[Sixth Avenue]] between [[13th Street (Manhattan)|13th]] and [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Streets]]. The location was far north of where other [[dry goods]] stores were at the time.<ref name="encnyc2">Abelson, Elaine S. "R. H. Macy" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}</ref>{{rp|1102}}  On the company's first day of business on October 28, 1858, sales totaled $11.08, equal to $347.23 in 2020. From the beginning, the Macy's logo included a star, which comes from a tattoo that Macy got as a teenager when he worked on a Nantucket whaling ship, the ''Emily Morgan''.<ref name="robbins1933">{{cite news | author=Robbins, L.

As the business grew, Macy's expanded into neighboring buildings, opening more and more departments. The store used publicity devices such as a store [[Santa Claus]], themed exhibits, and illuminated window displays to draw in customers giving rise to the notion of ‘window shopping.’.<ref>{{cite gotham}}</ref>{{rp|945–6}} <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitmacysusa.com/article/history-macys-humble-beginnings-stunning-success|title=The History of Macy's: From Humble Beginnings to Stunning Success|last=Hanson {{!}} 12.6.2017|first=Keri|website=Visit Macy’s|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>  It also offered a money-back guarantee, although it accepted only cash into the 1950s. The store also produced its in-house [[made-to-measure]] clothing for both men and women, assembled in an on-site factory.<ref name="encnyc2" />{{rp|1102}}

In 1875, Macy took on two partners, Robert M. Valentine (1850–1879), a nephew; and Abiel T. La Forge (1842–1878) of [[Wisconsin]], who was the husband of a cousin.<ref name="forge">{{cite news | title=Abiel T.

H. Macy & Co."). [[Isidor Straus]] and his brother [[Nathan Straus]] had previously held a license to sell china and other goods in the Macy's store.

====Construction of Macy's Herald Square====
{{main|Macy's Herald Square}}

[[File:USA-NYC-Macys.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance detail]]
In 1902, the flagship store moved uptown to [[Herald Square]] at [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] and Broadway, so far north of the other main dry goods emporia that it had to offer a steam wagonette to transport customers from 14th Street to 34th Street.<ref name=encnyc2 /> Although the Herald Square store initially consisted of just one building, it expanded through new construction, eventually occupying almost the entire block bounded by [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] on the west, Broadway on the east, 34th Street on the south and [[35th Street (Manhattan)|35th Street]] on the north, with the exception of a small pre-existing building on the corner of 35th Street and Seventh Avenue and another on the corner of 34th Street and Broadway. This latter 5-story building was purchased by Robert H. Smith in 1900 for {{US$|375000|1900}} with the idea of getting in the way of Macy's becoming the largest store in the world: it is largely supposed that Smith, who was a neighbor of the Macy's store on 14th Street, was acting on behalf of [[Siegel-Cooper Company|Siegel-Cooper]], which had built what they thought was the world's largest store on Sixth Avenue in 1896. Macy's ignored the tactic, and simply built around the building, which now carries Macy's "shopping bag" sign by lease arrangement.<ref name="aia4" /> In 1912, Isidor Straus died in the sinking of the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' at the age of 67 with his wife, Ida.<ref>Straus, Isidor. Autobiography of Isidor Straus. Independently published by the Straus Historical Society, 2011. p.168-176</ref>

The [[Macy's Herald Square|original Broadway store]] was designed by architects [[Theodore de Lemos|De Lemos & Cordes]], was built in 1901–02 by the [[Fuller Company]] and has a [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] facade, but has been updated in many details. There were further additions to the west in 1924 and 1928, and the Seventh Avenue building in 1931, all designed by architect [[Robert D. Kohn]], the newer buildings were increasingly [[Art Deco]] in style.<ref name=aia4>{{cite AIA4}}, pp.225–6</ref><ref>Wurman, Richard Saul (2008).

====National expansion====
[[File:San Francisco Macys.jpg|thumb|right|The Macy's West flagship store in San Francisco, the former O'Connor, Moffat & Co. flagship]]
In the 1960s, Macy's built a store on [[Queens Boulevard]] in [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst]], in the New York City [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2012/08/06/macys.php|title=In The 1960s, One Queens Resident Refused To Sell Land To Macy's|work=Gothamist|access-date=June 21, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224232308/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/06/macys.php|archive-date=February 24, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> This resulted in a round department store on 90 percent of the lot, with a small privately owned house on the corner which was a Queens resident who refused to sell her land to Macy's despite the company's offer of $200,000. Mary Sendek, who was the owner of the small house, was the only resident who refused the company's offer and lived in her home on Queens Boulevard until her death. Macy's no longer fully occupies this building, which now contains the [[Queens Place Mall]], instead it moved its full outlet to the nearby [[Queens Center Mall|Queens Center]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/in-the-1960s-one-queens-resident-refused-to-sell-land-to-macys|title=In The 1960s, One Queens Resident Refused To Sell Land To Macy's|last=staff/jen-carlson|date=2012-08-06|website=Gothamist|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317054749/https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/in-the-1960s-one-queens-resident-refused-to-sell-land-to-macys|archive-date=March 17, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>

More distant acquisitions included [[Lasalle's|Lasalle & Koch]] ([[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], 1924), [[Davison's|Davison-Paxon-Stokes]] ([[Atlanta]], 1929), [[Bamberger's|L. Bamberger & Co.]] ([[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], 1929), [[Macy's West|O'Connor Moffat & Company]] (San Francisco, 1945) and John Taylor Dry Goods Co. ([[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], 1947). O'Connor Moffat was renamed [[Macy's West|Macy's San Francisco]] in 1947, later becoming Macy's California, and John Taylor was renamed Macy's Missouri-Kansas in 1949. Stores in Toledo retained the Lasalle's name until 1981, joining the Missouri-Kansas stores to become Macy's Midwest. The Toledo stores were sold to [[Elder-Beerman]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J3oUAAAAIBAJ&pg=6102,5947911&dq=woodville-mall+macy%27s&hl=en|title=4 Macy stores in area sold to Dayton firm|last=Marrison|first=Ben|date=July 3, 1985|work=The Toledo Blade|access-date=July 1, 2017}}</ref>

Macy's New York began opening stores outside of its historic New York City–Long Island trade area in 1983 with a location at [[Aventura Mall]] in [[Aventura, Florida]] (a suburb of Miami), followed by several locations in [[Plantation, Florida]] (now relocated from the Fashion Mall to the Broward Mall since the Burdine's acquisition), [[Houston]], New Orleans, and [[Dallas]]. Davison's in [[Atlanta]] was renamed Macy's Atlanta in early 1985 with the consolidation of an early incarnation of [[Macy's Midwest]] (former Taylor and Lasalle's stores in [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]] and Toledo, respectively), but late in 1985, Macy's sold the former Midwest locations. [[Bamberger's]], which had aggressively expanded throughout [[New Jersey]], into the [[Delaware Valley|Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan area]] in the 1960s and 1970s as well as into Nanuet, New York (southern Rockland County), and into the [[Baltimore metropolitan area]] in the early 1980s, was renamed Macy's New Jersey in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==History under Federated==
===1986&ndash;1993: Attempted buy-outs and bankruptcy===
In 1986 Edward Finkelstein, Chairman & CEO of R. H. Macy & Co., Inc., led a leveraged buy-out of the company and subsequently engaged in a takeover battle for [[Federated Department Stores, Inc.]], in 1988 that he lost to Canada's [[Campeau Corporation]]. As part of its settlement with Campeau, Macy's purchased Federated's California-based, fashion-oriented [[Bullock's]] and its high-end [[Bullocks Wilshire]] and [[I. Magnin]] divisions. It followed with a reorganization of its divisions into Macy's Northeast (former Macy's New York and Macy's New Jersey), Macy's South/Bullock's (Macy's Atlanta stores plus Macy's New York's operations in Texas, Florida and Louisiana), and Macy's California, the latter including a semi-autonomous I. Magnin/Bullocks Wilshire organization. The Bullocks Wilshire stores were renamed I. Magnin in 1989. Subsequently, R. H. Macy & Co., Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 27, 1992, after which point its banks brought in a new management team, which shut several underperforming stores, jettisoned two-thirds of the luxury I. Magnin chain, and reduced Macy's to two divisions, [[Macy's East]] and [[Macy's West]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

'''Macy's East''', New York City was a division of [[Macy's, Inc.]] It is the operating successor to the original R.H. Macy & Co., Inc. and operates the Macy's department stores in the northeast U.S. and Puerto Rico. Over the years it has been known as '''Macy's New York''' and '''Macy's Northeast'''. On February 1, 2006, Macy's East assumed operating control over the [[Filene's]], [[Strawbridge's]], many of the [[Kaufmann's]] stores in upstate New York and the [[Hecht's]] stores in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], D.C. and northern Virginia. These locations assumed the Macy's moniker officially on September 9, 2006. In 2008 Macy's East took over the small Macy's North division.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In May 1993, Macy's announced the planned fall 1994 launch of TV Macy's, the retailer's own home shopping channel, in conjunction with [[Don Hewitt]], Thomas Leahy and [[Cablevision]].<ref name="chisuntimes1993">{{cite news | author=Staff | title=Macy's Announces TV Shopping Network | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4173023.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610054103/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4173023.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=June 10, 2014 | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=June 2, 1993 | via=[[HighBeam Research]] }}</ref>

===1994&ndash;2005: Acquisition by Federated===
[[File:Macy's Headquarters.jpg|thumb|Macy's headquarters in [[Downtown Cincinnati]]]]
R. H. Macy & Co. merged with [[Federated Department Stores]] on December 19, 1994. Following the merger, the reorganized Macy's moved its headquarters to [[Cincinnati]], Ohio. Federated promptly shut down the remainder of the I. Magnin chain, converting several to Macy's or Bullock's and selling four in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]], [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], San Diego and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] to [[Saks Fifth Avenue]]. Federated also merged its [[Abraham & Straus]]/[[Jordan Marsh]] division with the new "Macy's East" organization based in New York, renaming the [[Abraham & Straus]] stores in metropolitan New York with the Macy's nameplate in 1995, and then erasing the [[Jordan Marsh]] moniker in [[New England]] in early 1996.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/07/15/macys-plans-merger-with-federated/6059c11a-2dcb-4f4e-b819-3ab374150057/|title=MACY'S PLANS MERGER WITH FEDERATED|last=Grimsley|first=Kirstin Downey|date=July 15, 1994|work=Washington Post|access-date=June 21, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

Federated followed that by leading a bid in mid-1995 to acquire the bankrupt [[Woodward & Lothrop]]/[[Wanamaker's|John Wanamaker]] organization in the mid-Atlantic region, a bid it lost to rival group led by long-time rival and future acquisition target [[The May Department Stores Company]]. Instead Federated soon agreed to purchase [[Broadway Stores]], Inc. (owner of [[The Broadway]], [[The Emporium, San Francisco|Emporium]] and [[Weinstock's]] stores in California, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico), from its majority shareholder, [[Sam Zell]], thereby gaining a leading position in Southern California and a dominant one in the Northern California marketplace. In early 1996 Federated dissolved Broadway Stores, incorporating the majority of its locations into [[Macy's West]], rebadging them as Macy's and using the opportunity to retire the Bullock's name. Several of the redundant Broadway locations were used to establish [[Bloomingdale's]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], while many other were sold to [[Sears]].

In 2001 Federated dissolved its [[Stern's]] division in the New York metropolitan area, with the bulk of the stores being absorbed into [[Macy's East]]. Additionally, in July 2001 it acquired the [[Liberty House (US)|Liberty House]] chain with department and specialty stores in Hawaii and Guam, consolidating it with Macy's West.

In early 2003 Federated closed the majority of its historic [[Davison's]] franchise in Atlanta (operating as Macy's since 1985), rebranding its other Atlanta division [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]] with the unwieldy name, Rich's–Macy's. The downtown location—formerly the Davison's flagship store at [[Davison's|180 Peachtree Street]] – was shuttered at this time as well. The original Macy's [[Lenox Square]] and [[Perimeter Mall]] locations were extensively remodeled and opened in October 2003 as the first [[Bloomingdale's]] stores in Atlanta. The company rapidly followed suit in May 2003 with similar rebranding announcements for its other nameplates, [[Burdines]] in Florida, [[Goldsmith's]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Lazarus (department store)|Lazarus]] in the lower Midwest, and [[The Bon Marché]] in the Pacific Northwest.

On March 6, 2005, the [[The Bon Marché|Bon-Macy's]], [[Burdines|Burdines-Macy's]], [[Goldsmith's|Goldsmith's-Macy's]], [[Lazarus (department store)|Lazarus-Macy's]], and [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's-Macy's]] stores were renamed as simply "Macy's", the first two as the new [[Macy's West]] and [[Macy's Florida]] divisions respectively and the later three as part of the [[Macy's Central]] division. {{As of|07|2005}}, Macy's had 424 stores throughout the U.S.<ref name="ataglance" />

===2005&ndash;2006: Effects of Federated&ndash;May merger===
[[File:Macy's at Westfield Hawthorn.jpg|right|thumb|Exterior of a typical ex-[[Marshall Field's]] suburban Macy's store at [[Westfield Hawthorn]] in [[Vernon Hills, Illinois]]]]
On February 28, 2005, Federated agreed to terms of a deal to acquire [[The May Department Stores Company]] for $11&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|11000000000|2005|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|USD}}) in stock, creating the nation's second largest department store chain with $30&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|30000000000|2005|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|USD}}) in annual sales and more than 1,000 stores.

On July 28, 2005, Federated announced, based on the success of converting its own regional brands to the Macy's name, its plans to similarly convert 330 [[List of department stores by country|regional department stores]] owned by the May Company (as May Department Stores was generally referred to) to the Macy's nameplate. This included May's [[Marshall Field's]] (which had just been purchased by the May Company from [[Target Corporation|Target]] in 2004), [[Kaufmann's]], [[Famous-Barr]], [[Filene's]], [[Foley's]], [[Hecht's]], [[The Jones Store]], [[L. S. Ayres]], [[Meier & Frank]], [[Robinsons-May]], and [[Strawbridge & Clothier]] chains, pending approval of the merger by federal regulators.

The rebranding of the May stores was disliked in Chicago and elsewhere because the stores were regarded as beloved local institutions. The renaming of Filene's, Marshall Field's, and Kaufmann's, which were well known for their downtown flagship stores and local traditions provoked the most outrage. For example, Kaufmann's operated the Kaufmann's [[Celebrate the Season Parade]] which was traditionally broadcast live throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on television. Many customers publicly vowed to never again shop at the renamed May stores and to switch to competitors. Prominent film critic [[Roger Ebert]] voiced the grief of many Chicagoans at the loss of Field's when he wrote in his column on September 21, 2005:

{{quote|I thought the day would never come. I am looking at my Field's charge card, which I have cut up into tiny pieces.

On January 12, 2006, Federated announced its plans to divest May Company's [[Lord & Taylor]] division by the end of 2006 before converting and closing seven stores. On June 22, 2006, Macy's announced that NDRC Equity Partners, LLC would purchase Lord & Taylor for US$1.2&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|1200000000|2006|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|USD}}),<ref name="macysprjun2006">{{cite press release | url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=84477&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=875337 | title=Federated Agrees to Sell Lord & Taylor to NRDC Equity Partners; Transaction Expected to Close in Third Quarter of 2006 | publisher=Macy's | date=June 22, 2006 | via=NASDAQ Investor Relations Platform }}</ref> and completed the sale in October 2006.

By September 9, 2006, after renaming the former May Company stores, Macy's operated approximately 850 stores in the United States. To promote its largest and most recent expansion, Macy's used a version of the [[Martha and the Vandellas]] hit song, "Dancing in the Street", in its advertising. Also, the company took [[Theatrical property|props]] from its annual [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade|Thanksgiving Day parade]] to various re-labeled stores throughout the nation, in what the company marketed as its "Parade on Parade".

In October 2006, Federated Department Stores entered into an agreement with [[Zoom Systems]] to test more than 100 stores within retail giant Macy's. Terry Lundgren, CEO of Federated, raved about the ability to provide consumers with a convenient means to purchase iPods and other consumer electronics, saying "This is exciting because it brings most-wanted merchandise into stores in a unique new way.... How cool is that?" Today, Macy's has converted its entire Electronics section in every store to (over 400) eSpot [[ZoomShops]].

Macy's significantly increased its use of television advertising and product placement in 2006 and 2007, using branding spots that featured the new Macy's star logo. Macy's television commercials are produced primarily by [[New York Production Services]], a New York-based commercial and independent film production company. During two episodes of the popular [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Desperate Housewives]] ''("[[I Remember That]]" and "[[Now You Know (Desperate Housewives)|Now You Know]]"), a Macy's location in the fictional city of Fairview was featured, rare instances of [[product placement]] promoting a department store chain in a scripted series. Nearly two years prior to the first episode, one of the first national commercials for Macy's had aired during ''Desperate Housewives'', shortly after the conversions of Rich's, Lazarus, Goldsmith's, The Bon Marché and Burdines.

==Criticism and controversy==
In July 2003, then-[[New York State Attorney General]] [[Eliot Spitzer]] launched an investigation of the private policing system Macy's has used to deal with suspected shoplifters. The investigation was prompted by a civil rights lawsuit and an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', which reported on many of Macy's tactics, including private jails and interrogations.<ref name="elliott2003">{{cite news | author=Elliott, Andrea | author-link=Andrea Elliott | title=In Stores, Private Handcuffs for Sticky Fingers | date=June 17, 2003 | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/17/nyregion/in-stores-private-handcuffs-for-sticky-fingers.html }}</ref> Spitzer's investigation found many of Macy's actions, from ethnic profiling to handcuffing detainees, to be unlawful. In 2005, Macy's settled the civil rights complaint for {{US$|600000|2005}}, claiming to have ended the illegal tactics while maintaining the security system itself.<ref name="elliott2005">{{cite news | author=Elliott, Andrea | author-link=Andrea Elliott | date=January 14, 2005 | title=Macy's Settles Complaint of Racial Profiling for $600,000 | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/14/nyregion/14macys.html }}</ref>

On June 6, 2006, Macy's downtown Boston store (formerly the [[Jordan Marsh]] flagship) removed two [[mannequin]]s and the Web address of the AIDS Action Committee from a window display promoting Boston's annual [[gay pride]] celebration. The removal was apparently in response to pressure from MassResistance, a local group opposed to [[same-sex marriage]], whose members complained the mannequins were "homosexual". The removal of the mannequins was controversial and Boston mayor [[Thomas Menino]] was quoted as saying:

{{quote|I'm very surprised that Macy's would bend to that type of pressure. Macy's was celebrating a part of our community, gay pride, and they should be proud of the [[gay community]], and I'm proud of the gay community and gay pride.<ref name="baywind2006">{{cite news | title=Now you see 'em, now you don't | author=(no byline) | work=[[Bay Windows (publication)|Bay Windows]] | oclc=61124500 | location=Boston, Massachusetts, United States | date=8 June 2006 | url=http://www.baywindows.com/now-you-see-em-now-you-dont-68914 }}</ref>}}

Macy's responded by publishing an apology by the Macy's East chairman, Ron Klein, in ''In Newsweekly'', a Boston-area weekly with a large gay readership. Klein's description of the incident as "an internal breakdown in communication", further stated it was regrettable some would doubt Macy's commitment to diversity as a result.<ref name="kilduff2006">{{cite news | title=CEO admits 'Macy's mistake' | author=Kilduff, Thomas E. | work=[[In Newsweekly]] | department=NATL | date=June 14, 2006 | url=http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ne&article_code=2090 | url-status=dead | archive-date=June 29, 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629193351/http://innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Ne&article_code=2090 }}  ''Note: Only the first of two pages have been archived.''</ref>  The Web address was later restored—the mannequins, however, never made a reappearance.
