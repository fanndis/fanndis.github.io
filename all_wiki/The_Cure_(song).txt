"'''The Cure'''" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter [[Lady Gaga]]. She co-wrote the song with [[DJ White Shadow]], [[Nick Monson]], [[Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real|Lukas Nelson]], and Mark Nilan; Detroit City, Gaga, and Monson produced the song. The song originated from a positive vibe between the collaborators, created as a response to atrocities happening around the world. It was developed in [[Los Angeles, California]], where Gaga and her team were working on some music before the singer started filming the 2018 remake of ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. Consisting of [[finger snap]]s and an [[electronic pop]] beat, "The Cure" is composed around an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] sound. Lyrically, the song talks about the healing effects of love, with the singer advocating herself as the one administering 'the cure'.

The song was released as a standalone single by [[Interscope Records]] on April 16, 2017, after Gaga performed it live at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], where she was a main headliner. Gaga later included it on the setlist of the [[Joanne World Tour]] (2017–2018). Critics analysed the sudden release of the track, finding it to be a departure from the singer's previous releases, and wrote about the anthemic nature of the composition. Commercially, "The Cure" reached the top 10 of the [[record charts]] in Australia, Hungary, Lebanon, Scotland, Slovakia and Venezuela, and the digital charts of Finland, Greece, and combined-Europe, as well as the top 20 in the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Latvia, and Malaysia.

== Writing and development ==
"The Cure" was written after Gaga's performance at the [[Super Bowl LI halftime show]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2017/jul/02/lady-gaga-prepares-her-live-performances/|title=Lady Gaga prepares her live performances|last=Fekadu|first=Mesfin|date=July 2, 2017|accessdate=July 3, 2017|newspaper=[[The Columbian]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702194228/http://www.columbian.com/news/2017/jul/02/lady-gaga-prepares-her-live-performances/|archivedate=July 2, 2017}}</ref> Gaga worked with longtime collaborator [[DJ White Shadow]] (aka Paul Blair) for the track. He recalled sitting with Gaga and feeling a positive vibe, which led them to write the track described by Blair as "upbeat and cool". Their camaraderie originated due to the "terrible stuff going on in the world right now, it's like when you're a creative person you do your best to try and combat evil with creative stuff, so that was kind of the vibe." Gaga and her team wanted to release the "one-off" single as soon as production was completed.<ref name="thecuredev"/>

The song was developed in Los Angeles, where Gaga and her team were working on some other music before the singer became busy with her acting endeavor for ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. Gaga utilized the free time from her schedule and asked Blair to meet up and see if they could come up with any new music. "The Cure" was released due to the positive nature and message in the track, although Gaga had already released ''[[Joanne (album)|Joanne]]'', her fifth studio album, six months prior. According to Jocelyn Vena from [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]], "The Cure" reminded her of the singer's dance-pop songs. Blair explained that the release happened after agreement between all the personnel involved: "''Joanne''{{'}}s a great record... we weren't sitting there like, 'Oh, we need to make a song for the summertime and put it out this weekend'."<ref name="thecuredev">{{cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/lady-gagas-releases-new-song-the-cure|title=Lady Gaga's Release of "The Cure" Proves She Does Nothing Low Key|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|publisher=[[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]]|date=April 27, 2017|access-date=April 29, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807234947/http://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/lady-gagas-releases-new-song-the-cure|archivedate=August 7, 2017}}</ref>

Lyrically, the song talks about the healing effect of love. In an article for ''Bustle'', Danielle Jackson presumed it to be love from her fans who had supported Gaga throughout her career. While performing "The Cure" at '[[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]]', the singer said to the crowd: "I love you guys so much. I have been through so much in my life and I've seen so much. And you cure me every time with your love." The dedication-like lyrics begins with the singer comparing her music as an escape route for her fans. This is expanded upon in the chorus when Gaga belts "If I can't find the cure, I'll, I'll fix you with my love", thus positioning herself as someone who advocates for the troubling time in anyone's life, evident by the closing line "Promise I'll always be there, Promise I'll be the cure".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/lady-gagas-the-cure-lyrics-might-be-a-sweet-ode-to-her-fans-51539|last=Jackson|first=Danielle|title=Lady Gaga's "The Cure" Lyrics Might Be A Sweet Ode To Her Fans|date=April 16, 2017|access-date=April 17, 2017|work=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421094248/https://www.bustle.com/p/lady-gagas-the-cure-lyrics-might-be-a-sweet-ode-to-her-fans-51539|archivedate=April 21, 2017}}</ref> Ally Hirschalg from [[Mic (media company)|Mic]] also found other explanations from the lyrics: a mother talking to her children and someone who had a recent break-up, the latter alluding to Gaga's break-up with fiancée [[Taylor Kinney]] the previous year.<ref name="mic.com">{{cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/174364/lady-gaga-the-cure-lyrics-every-verse-to-the-song-that-debuted-at-coachella|title=Lady Gaga 'The Cure' lyrics: Every verse to the song that debuted at Coachella|last=Hirschlag|first=Ally|publisher=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]|date=April 27, 2017|access-date=April 29, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426152514/http://www.earone.it/news/lady_gaga_the_cure_radio_date_21_04_2017_23323656/|archivedate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>

Jason Lipshutz from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' complimented the "slower tempo" and the "new jam just in time for summer" feel of the track, but he also said that the stylistic and sonic shift from ''Joanne'' to "The Cure" felt like "an abrupt course correction, meant to build momentum ahead of [[Joanne World Tour|her summer tour]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7767610/lady-gaga-the-cure-joanne-career-correction|title=Is Lady Gaga's 'The Cure' a Bold New Step, or a Necessary Course Correction?|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|work=Billboard|date=April 19, 2017|access-date=April 29, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420071521/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7767610/lady-gaga-the-cure-joanne-career-correction|archivedate=April 20, 2017}}</ref> Hugh McIntyre from ''[[Forbes]]'' said that the track "is a noticeable departure from anything Gaga has ever released before".

Lior Philips from ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' found influences of Gaga's "dance musicality" in "The Cure", especially in the "finger clicking, pristine clean production, anthemic flute-like synth, and her remarkable falsetto". Comparing the track to songs by [[OneRepublic]], Philips complimented the simplicity of the verses, writing that it "intensifies the mood".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Philips|first1=Lior|title=Top Songs of the Month: Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga, and Prince|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/04/top-songs-of-the-month-kendrick-lamar-lady-gaga-and-prince/3//|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|accessdate=April 28, 2017|date=April 28, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809211000/https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/04/top-songs-of-the-month-kendrick-lamar-lady-gaga-and-prince/3/|archivedate=August 9, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' writer Mikael Wood states that "The Cure" is "an intriguing midtempo pop-soul jam", with "synthetic textures", and "very [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] circa '[[Human Nature (Madonna song)|Human Nature]]'".<ref name="LA Times">{{cite web|last1=Wood|first1=Mikael|title=Lady Gaga's Coachella performance was an absolute thrill&nbsp;– until it wasn't|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-lady-gaga-coachella-20170416-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=April 17, 2017|date=April 16, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417100643/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-lady-gaga-coachella-20170416-story.html|archivedate=April 17, 2017}}</ref> Amy Mackelden of ''[[Marie Claire]]'' called it a "synth-pop masterpiece that will be stuck in your head from the second you hear it" and further wrote: "The lyrics are super uplifting and relatable, especially as the chorus features the positive refrain, 'No matter what you know, I'll fix you with my love.'"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mackelden|first1=Amy|title=Lady Gaga Debuted New Single 'The Cure' at Coachella|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/music/news/a26605/lady-gaga-debuted-new-single-the-cure-at-coachella/|website=[[Marie Claire]]|accessdate=April 17, 2017|date=April 16, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418000047/http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/music/news/a26605/lady-gaga-debuted-new-single-the-cure-at-coachella/|archivedate=April 18, 2017}}</ref> Ian Monroe from ''[[V (American magazine)|V]]'' praised the song for its lyrics and called it "the song of the summer".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Monroe|first1=Ian|title=Lady Gaga Surprises with New Track 'The Cure'|url=http://vmagazine.com/article/lady-gaga-surprises-new-track-cure/|website=[[V (American magazine)|V]]|accessdate=April 17, 2017|date=April 16, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426152514/http://www.earone.it/news/lady_gaga_the_cure_radio_date_21_04_2017_23323656/|archivedate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>

Negative reviews came from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Nolan Feeney, who found "The Cure" to be "generic" and resemblance with other pop songs released concurrently.
