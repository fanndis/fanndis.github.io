A '''box set''' or '''boxed set''' is a set of items (for example, a compilation of books, musical recordings, films or television programs) traditionally packaged in a box and is offered for sale as a single unit.

==Music==
Artists and bands with an extremely long and successful career often have [[anthology]] or "essential" collections of their boxes of music released as box sets. These often include rare and never-before-released tracks. Some box sets collect previously released boxes of singles or albums by a music artist, and often collect the complete discography of an artist such as [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Oh, by the Way]]'' and ''[[Why Pink Floyd...?|Discovery]]'' sets. Sometimes bands release expanded versions of their most successful albums such as Pink Floyd's ''Immersion'' box set versions of their ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973), ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975) and ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979) albums. Pink Floyd have also released ''[[The Early Years 1965â€“1972]]'' box set which features mostly unreleased material.

Other music box sets focus on a compilation of boxes of different artists from a particular genre such as [[Big Band]] [[jazz]], 1960s [[rock and roll]], or opera. They generally feature a large collection of various hits from some of the top artists of a particular genre. The scope of such box sets varies widely, with some genre-specific box sets (such as one featuring rock music) focusing on boxes of a specific style (for instance, guitar rock or "[[Summer of Love]]" music). Two of the best known companies for making box sets are [[Legacy Recordings]] and [[Rhino Records]]; both have won multiple [[Grammy Awards]]. Prior to Rhino and Legacy, companies such as [[Time-Life|Time-Life Records]] and [[Readers Digest]] also issued box sets.

In rare cases, box sets contain all original material such as ''[[In Search of The]]'', a 13-disc set by [[Buckethead]], or [[Klaus Schulze]]'s ''Contemporary Works'' duo. Some box sets become best sellers, such as [[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[Led Zeppelin Boxed Set|Led Zeppelin]]'' (1990), [[George Strait]]'s ''[[Strait Out of the Box]]'' (1995), [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[With the Lights Out]]'' (2004) and [[The Beatles]]' twin ''[[The Beatles Stereo Box Set]]'' and ''[[The Beatles in Mono]]'' discography box sets (2009).

In classical music, box sets often contain all works of a certain composer or all works in a certain genre, like [[Symphony|symphonies]] or [[chamber music]], performed by a certain orchestra, [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] or conductor.

==Books==
Well-known authors and artists who have written or produced several related books or portfolios of [[fine art photography]] or other artistic mediums whose work is considered historically, culturally, or socially significant may have certain works sold as box sets. For example, one can buy box sets of the plays of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], collection of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] novels, or [[Ansel Adams]] photographic prints. There are now also digital boxed set collections, such as ''21 Shades of Night''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hotboxedbooks.com/21shadesofnight/|title=Hotboxedbooks.com|website=hotboxedbooks.com|access-date=24 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502063330/http://hotboxedbooks.com/21shadesofnight/|archive-date=2 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Television and film==
Films, television and other video programs on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] are sometimes sold as box sets, as were certain titles on the now-discontinued [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] formats. Such a box set might include an entire [[Television season|season]] or seasons, or the complete series, of a popular TV program, a collection of films by a well-known director or starring a well-known actor/actress, or a collection of films of a particular genre such as horror, sci-fi and westerns. Other criteria for box sets have included all films of a series such as the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series or the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy, and a selection of adaptions of a particular author such as [[Stephen King]] or [[Jane Austen]]. Some box sets contain different versions of one film, as in the case of ''[[Blade Runner]]'', and ''[[Alien Quadrilogy]]''.

One of the most popular box sets of all time is "The ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' Collection" released in 1999 by [[New Line Platinum Series]], which contained the original seven films, a bonus DVD containing special features titled ''The Nightmare Series Encyclopedia'', two pairs of 3-D glasses for the last ten minutes of ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'', a commemorative booklet about the films titled ''The Nightmare is Alive'' and more. Other notable boxsets include the ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' "Dragon Box" set, often considered to be the best release of the series to date due to the high quality of the remasters and the plentiful number of features, the "Shirley Temple Little Darling" DVD collection, an 18-disc DVD box set of [[Shirley Temple]] movies which were constantly advertised on TV for years as a "limited time offer", and the "''[[Star Wars]]'' Trilogy: The Definitive Collection" LaserDisc box set, which was one of the last home video releases of the original trilogy before the [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|special editions]].

With the advent of streaming services such as [[Netflix]], a "box set" also describes a series where all episodes are available to watch immediately, as opposed to traditional [[Broadcast programming|scheduling]].
