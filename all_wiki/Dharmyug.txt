==History==
The magazine was originally published by a [[Dalmia Group|Dalmia]] press in [[Bombay]] from 1949, just after [[independence of India]], however it incorporated an earlier pictorial magazine ''Nav Yug'' that began in 1932.<ref>Dharmyug, 20 July 1952, cover states that it incorporates Nav Yug</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bf_hAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=nav+yug++1932&source=bl&ots=17lzH5D-9A&sig=SddB6GIeQl7Iy-9x2wgvXENGPAg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yOhUVezuK8bvoAS-84HQBw&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=nav%20yug%20%201932&f=false [[Jogendra N.

''Dharmyug'' was considered to be the most respected publication of its time. Many distinguished authors got their break into the field when they published in ''Dharmyug''.<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/features/blink/read/the-rise-of-online-publishing-and-social-media-benefits-the-hindi-authors-and-readers/article6913202.ece Is Hindi literature back in fashion?, KALYANI PRASHER, February 20, 2015 In 1987, the year after she turned 40, Pamela Manasi got her big break when ''Dharamyug'' published her story ‘Jagtu’.]</ref> Dharmyug also provided a beginning to painters like [[J.P.

It was a sad end to the saga of a Hindi magazine that once sold more than four [[lakh]] copies a week<ref name=c/> and gave a platform to many new Hindi writers and poets, like [[Mrinal Pande]] and [[Rajesh Joshi]]. The magazine was the first to serialize that tremendous milestone of Hindi and Indian theater ''Aadhe Adhure'' by [[Mohan Rakesh]], as well as the first to publish stories of [[Shivani]].<ref name=d/><ref name=c/>
