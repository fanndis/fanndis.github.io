'''''The Jerusalem Post''''' is a [[Centrism|centrist]] [[broadsheet]] newspaper based in [[Jerusalem]], founded in 1932 during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] by [[Gershon Agron]] as ''The Palestine Post''. In 1950, it changed its name to ''The Jerusalem Post''. In 2004, the paper was bought by Mirkaei Tikshoret, a diversified Israeli media firm controlled by investor [[Eli Azur]]. In April 2014, Azur acquired the newspaper ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]''.<ref>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/290475 ‘Maariv’ Newspaper to Be Sold to Businessman Eli Azur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062340/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/290475 |date=4 March 2016 }} News flash at israelnationalnews.com</ref> The newspaper is published in English and previously also printed a French edition.

==History==
===1925–1950===
An antecedent paper, ''The Palestine Bulletin'' was founded in January 1925 by Jacob Landau of the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]].<ref name=Birnhack>{{cite book | author = Michael D. Birnhack | title = Colonial Copyright: Intellectual Property in Mandate Palestine | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2012 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rLAdYH0K6CYC }}</ref> It was owned by the Palestine Telegraphic Agency, which was in practice part of the JTA even though it was legally separate.<ref name=Birnhack/> On 1 November 1931, editorship of the ''Bulletin'' was taken over by [[Gershon Agron]]sky (later Agron), a Jewish journalist who had immigrated to Palestine from the United States.<ref>''Palestine Bulletin'', 31 October 1931.</ref> In March 1932, a dispute arose between Landau and Agronsky, which Agronsky resolved to settle by establishing an independent newspaper.<ref name=Birnhack/> However, Landau and Agronsky instead came to an agreement to transform the ''Bulletin'' into a new jointly owned newspaper.<ref name=Birnhack/> Accordingly, the ''Palestine Bulletin'' published its last issue on 30 November 1932 and ''The Palestine Post Incorporating The Palestine Bulletin'' appeared the following day, 1 December 1932.<ref name=Birnhack/> On 25 April 1933, the masthead was reduced to just ''The Palestine Post'', though the newspaper continued to state its founding year as 1925 for at least a year afterwards.<ref>Palestine Post, 25 April 1993 and 25 August 1934.</ref>

[[File:PalestinePost Israel is born.jpg|thumb|16 May 1948 edition of ''The Palestine Post'']]
During its time as ''The Palestine Post'', the publication supported the struggle for a [[Jewish homeland]] in Palestine and openly opposed British policy restricting [[aliyah|Jewish immigration]] during the Mandate period. According to one commentator, "[[Zionist]] institutions considered the newspaper one of the most effective means of exerting influence on the British authorities."<ref>Wilson, Cynthia: [https://books.google.com/books?id=hKj9BwrJjtAC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=%22zionist+initiative%22#v=onepage&q=%22zionist%3Dinitiative%22&f=false Attributed to Penslar D.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515150707/https://books.google.com/books?id=hKj9BwrJjtAC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=%22zionist+initiative%22#v=onepage&q=%22zionist%3Dinitiative%22&f=false |date=15 May 2016 }} at footnote, p. 34, ''Always Something New to Discover: Menahem Pressler and the Beaux Arts Trio'', Paragon Publishing 2011, accessed at [[Google Books]], 5 August 2014</ref>

====1948 bombing====
On the evening of 1 February 1948, a stolen [[Palestine Police Force|British police]] car loaded with half a ton of TNT pulled up in front of the Jerusalem office of the ''Palestine Post''; the driver of a second car arrived a few minutes later, [[Ben Yehuda Street bombings#1948|lit the fuse and drove off]].<ref name="google1948">{{cite web |url=http://www.ajhs.org/scholarship/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=285 |title=American Jewish Historical Society: American Newlyweds in Israel, 1948 |accessdate=2011-04-25 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429081018/http://www.ajhs.org/scholarship/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=285 |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The building also contained other newspaper offices, the British press censor, the Jewish settlement police, and a [[Haganah]] post with a cache of weapons. Arab leader [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]] claimed responsibility for the bombing, but historian Uri Milstein reported that the bomb had been prepared by the [[Nazi]]-trained Fawzi el-Kutub, known as "the engineer", with the involvement of two British army [[desertion|deserters]], Cpl.

===1950–present===
In 1950, two years after the [[State of Israel]] was [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|declared]], the paper was renamed ''The Jerusalem Post.''<ref>[https://www.jpost.com/features/magazine-features/a-backward-glance-a-forward-step A backward glance, a forward step]</ref>

The [[broadsheet]] newspaper is published from Sunday to Friday, with no edition appearing on Saturday (the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]) and [[Jewish holiday|Jewish religious holidays]]. Regular opinion columnists write on subjects such as religion, foreign affairs and economics. {{As of|2016}} the managing editor is [[David Brinn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/AboutUs.aspx|title=The Jerusalem Post - About Us|website=Jpost.com}}</ref>
Some of the material is translated and included in the free Hebrew daily ''[[Israel Post]]'', of which [[Eli Azur]] is a co-owner.

In January, 2008, the paper announced a new partnership with ''The Wall Street Journal'', including joint marketing and exclusive publication in Israel of ''[[The Wall Street Journal Europe]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1195127541930&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=JPost &#124; French-language news from Israel, the Middle East & the Jewish World |publisher=Fr.jpost.com |accessdate=2013-11-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222213432/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1195127541930&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

''The Jerusalem Post'' also publishes a monthly magazine titled ''IVRIT'' edited by Dr. Sarit Yalov. Its target audience is people learning [[Hebrew language]] and it is described as "an easy-Hebrew" publication, meant for improving basic Hebrew reading skills. It uses the [[Niqqud|vowel notation system]] to make comprehension of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] [[abjad]] simpler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Ivrit/Home.aspx |title=Ivrit |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref> ''[[The Jerusalem Report]]'', now edited by [[Steve Linde]], is a [[wiktionary:biweekly|fortnightly]] print and [[online]] glossy [[newsmagazine]].

In 2020, [[Reuters]] reported that Jerusalem Post along with [[Algemeiner]], [[The Times of Israel]] and [[Arutz Sheva]] had published op-eds written by non-existent people.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-deepfake-activist-idUSKCN24G15E |title=Deepfake used to attack activist couple shows new disinformation frontier|date=15 July 2020 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=26 September 2020}}</ref><ref name="JWeekly">{{cite web|url=https://www.jweekly.com/2020/07/17/news-outlets-covering-israel-found-again-to-have-run-fake-op-eds/ |title=News outlets covering Israel found, again, to have run fake op-eds|date=17 July 2020 |publisher=[[J.

==Ownership changes==
Until 1989, the paper supported the forerunners of the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]]. In 1989, the paper was purchased by [[Hollinger Inc.]], owned by [[Conrad Black]].  A number of journalists resigned from the Post after Black's takeover and founded ''[[The Jerusalem Report]]'', a weekly magazine eventually sold to the ''Post''. 

Under editor-in-chief [[David Makovsky]], from 1999 to 2000, the paper took a centrist position on defense, but began to reject socialism.<ref name="Judaica"/> In 2002, Hollinger hired the politically conservative [[Bret Stephens]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as editor-in-chief. David Horovitz took over as editor-in-chief on 1 October 2004,<ref name=Balint>Anat Balint, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/jlem-post-change-of-editors-1.133866 Jlem Post change of editors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408092632/http://www.haaretz.com/news/jlem-post-change-of-editors-1.133866 |date=8 April 2016 }}, Haaretz, Sep. 5, 2004</ref> returning the paper to a centrist position.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=September 29, 2020|title=Jerusalem Post|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jerusalem-post|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref> On 16 November 2004, Hollinger sold the paper to [[Mirkaei Tikshoret Limited]], a [[Tel Aviv]]-based publisher of Israeli newspapers. [[CanWest Global Communications]], Canada's biggest media concern, had announced an agreement to take a 50 percent stake in ''The Jerusalem Post'' after Mirkaei bought the property, but the deal soured. The two sides went to arbitration, and CanWest lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-124755737.html |title=CanWest loses battle for 50% of 'Jerusalem Post' |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |via=Highbeam.com |accessdate=2013-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025041543/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-124755737.html |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  

In 2011, Horovitz was succeeded by the paper's managing editor, Steve Linde, who professed to maintain political moderation and balance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Horovitz-steps-down-Linde-taking-over-as-JPost-editor |title=Horovitz steps down, Linde taking over as JPost editor |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=2011-06-12}}</ref> [[Yaakov Katz (journalist)|Yaakov Katz]], the paper's former military analyst and a fellow at the [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]], succeeded Linde in April 2016.
