Unilever was founded on 2 September 1929, by the merger of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] margarine producer [[Margarine Unie]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]] soapmaker [[Lever Brothers]]. During the second half of the 20th century, the company increasingly diversified from being a maker of products made of oils and fats and expanded its operations worldwide. It has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including [[Lipton]] (1971), [[Brooke Bond]] (1984), Chesebrough-Ponds (1987), [[Best Foods]] (2000), [[Ben & Jerry's]] (2000), [[Alberto-Culver]] (2010), [[Dollar Shave Club]] (2016) and Pukka Herbs (2017). Unilever divested its specialty chemicals businesses to [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] in 1997. In the 2010s, under the leadership of [[Paul Polman]], the company gradually shifted its focus towards health and beauty brands and away from food brands showing slow growth.<ref name="boyle2014">{{cite news | author=Boyle, Matthew | author2=Jarvis, Paul | title=Unilever Spreads Split Boosts Chance of Exit as Shares Gain | date=4 December 2014 | agency=[[Bloomberg News]] | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-04/unilever-plans-to-split-spreads-business-into-standalone-unit.html }}</ref>

===1921–1940===

In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch [[Margarine Unie]] and British soapmaker [[Lever Brothers]], with the name of the resulting company a [[portmanteau]] of the name of both companies.<ref name="Unilever global company website">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unilever.com/about/who-we-are/our-history/1920-1929.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725211548/http://www.unilever.com/about/who-we-are/our-history/1920-1929.html|url-status=dead|title=1920 - 1929: Unilever is formed|archivedate=25 July 2015|website=Unilever global company website}}</ref>

In the 1930s, business grew and new ventures were launched in Africa and Latin America. The Nazi occupation of Europe during the Second World War meant that Unilever was unable to reinvest its capital into Europe, so it instead acquired new businesses in the UK and the US.<ref name="Wubs154">{{cite book|author=Ben Wubs|title=International Business and National War Interests: Unilever Between Reich and Empire, 1939–45|url=https://archive.org/details/internationalbus00wubs|url-access=limited|date=11 June 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-11652-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/internationalbus00wubs/page/n168 154]}}</ref> In 1943, it acquired [[Thomas Lipton|T.

By the mid-1960s laundry soap and edible fats still contributed around half of Unilever's corporate profits.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> However, a stagnant market for yellow fats (butter, margarine, and similar products) and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from [[Procter & Gamble]] forced Unilever to diversify.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based [[Lipton|Lipton Ltd]] from [[Allied Suppliers]].<ref name=autogenerated3 /> In 1978, [[National Starch]] was acquired for $487 million, marking the largest ever foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.<ref name="HensmansJohnson140">{{cite book|author1=Manuel Hensmans|author2=Gerry Johnson|author3=George Yip|title=Strategic Transformation: Changing While Winning|date=8 January 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-26845-7|page=140}}</ref>

==Branding and advertising==

Unilever's largest international competitors are [[Nestlé]] and [[Procter & Gamble]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-09-04-2803687966_x.htm|title=Unilever: Nestle executive to take CEO job|accessdate=9 April 2012|publisher=USA Today|date=4 September 2008|first=Toby|last=Sterling}}</ref> 

=== Logo ===

In 1930, the logo of Unilever was in a [[sans-serif]] typeface and all-caps. The current Unilever corporate logo was introduced in 2004 and was designed by [[Wolff Olins]], a brand consultancy agency. The 'U' shape is now made up of 25 distinct symbols, each icon representing one of the company's sub-brands or its corporate values.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logodesignlove.com/unilever-icons |title=Unilever icons explained |publisher=Logodesignlove.com |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref> The brand identity was developed around the idea of "adding vitality to life."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolffolins.com/work/unilever |title=Unilever case study |publisher=Wolff Olins |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref>

=== Brands ===

==== Dove ====
[[File:Dove Shampoo and Acondicionador.jpg|thumb|Dove shampoo and conditioner]]

[[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] describes itself as being dedicated to "help&nbsp;... women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mydove.com.au/en/Our-Mission/Our-Vision/default.aspx|title=Our Vision|work=mydove.com.au|accessdate=21 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228221735/http://www.mydove.com.au/en/Our-Mission/Our-Vision/default.aspx|archivedate=28 February 2015}}</ref> Dove employs the use of advertising for its products to display its messages of positive self-esteem. In September 2004 Dove created a Real Beauty campaign,<ref>{{Cite news|date=29 July 2004|title='Real women' ad sets new trend|language=en-GB|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3936887.stm|access-date=14 July 2020}}</ref> focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour. Later in 2007, this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages. This campaign consisted mostly of advertisements, shown on television and popularised by the internet. Dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the Dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly and that women's aging process was something for which to be ashamed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimnonline.org/articles/dovebacklash.html|title=WIMN – Dove's "Real Beauty" Backlash|work=wimnonline.org|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref>

==== Lynx/Axe ====

[[Axe (Lynx)|Axe]], known as Lynx in the United Kingdom, the Republic of [[Ireland]], Australia and [[New Zealand]], is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the ages of 16 and 24.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/nov/20/marketingandpr|title=Lynx marketing campaign|author=Claire Cozens|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref> Its marketing is a "tongue-in-cheek take on the 'mating game'", suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men who use the products.<ref name="bbcdirtier">{{cite news|title='Offensive' Lynx adverts banned by advertising watchdog|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15849142|accessdate=22 February 2017|work=BBC News|date=23 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Rodionova|first1=Zlata|title=Unilever, the owner of Magnum and Lynx, vows to end gender stereotyping in its adverts|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uniliver-the-owner-of-magnum-and-lynx-vows-to-end-gender-stereotyping-in-its-adverts-a7097686.html|accessdate=22 February 2017|work=The Independent|date=23 June 2016}}</ref> Unlike Dove's long-running beauty campaign, Lynx advertising often creates mini-series of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea. Using images the company knows it will receive complaints garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety, often through controversy. A wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world. In 2012, Lynx's 'Clean Balls' advert was banned. In 2011, in the UK Lynx's shower gel campaign was banned.<ref name="bbcdirtier" /><ref>{{cite web|title=ASA Ruling on Unilever UK Ltd|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2011/11/Unilever-UK-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_166988.aspx|publisher=[[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]]|accessdate=22 February 2017|date=23 November 2011}}</ref>

Both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency. Lynx commonly portrays women as [[Hypersexuality|hypersexual]], flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by men, of all ages and stature, because of their use of the Lynx product.<ref name="theguardian.com"/>

=== Social media advertising===

On 26 June 2020, Unilever said it would halt advertising to U.S. customers on social media giants Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter until at least the end of 2020. Unilever cited "our Responsibility Framework and the polarized atmosphere in the U.S." and said that "continuing to advertise on these platforms at this time would not add value to people and society."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fung|first=Brian|date=26 June 2020|title=Facebook and Twitter stocks dive as Unilever halts advertising|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/26/tech/facebook-twitter-stock-unilever/index.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=26 June 2020|website=CNN}}</ref>

==Environmental record==
Unilever has declared the goal of decoupling its environmental impact from its growth, by halving the [[environmental footprint]] of its products by 2030; helping 1&nbsp;billion people improve their health and well-being; and sourcing all of its agricultural raw materials sustainably.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living-2014/ |publisher=Unilever| title= Sustainable Living Plan|date= 2014}}</ref> In September 2019, Unilever announced that its sites across five continents are now powered by 100% renewable grid electricity, ahead of its 2020 target.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smart-energy.com/renewable-energy/unilever-announces-global-move-to-100-renewable-energy-use/|title=Unilever announces global move to 100% renewable energy use|last=Gordon|first=Philip|date=16 September 2019|website=Smart Energy International|language=en-GB|access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref>

=== Mercury contamination ===
In 2001, a mercury thermometer factory operated by the Indian subsidiary of Unilever in the South Indian hilltown of [[Kodaikanal]] was shut down by state regulators after the company was caught for dumping toxic mercury wastes in a densely populated part of town.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Eade|first1=Deborah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jS-kRbWjeWwC&q=unilever+subsidiary+mercury+thermometer+2001&pg=PA84|title=Development and the Private Sector: Consuming Interests|last2=Sayer|first2=John|date=2006|publisher=Kumarian Press|isbn=978-1-56549-218-9|language=en}}</ref> By the company's own admissions, more than 2 tonnes of mercury were discharged into Kodaikanal's environment. A 2011 [[Ministry of Labour and Employment (India)|Government of India]] study on workers’ health concluded that many workers suffered from illnesses caused by workplace exposure to mercury.<ref name=":2" /> The scandal opened up a series of issues in India such as [[corporate liability]], [[corporate accountability]] and corporate negligence.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=http://kodaimercury.org/final-report-of-the-goi-committee/|title=Final Report of the GOI Committee|publisher=Government of India|date=9 November 2011|accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref>

In March 2016, Unilever reached an out of court settlement (for an undisclosed amount) with 591 ex-workers of the unit who had sued the company for knowingly exposing them to the toxic element.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/03/09/after-15-years-unilever-settles-with-indian-factory-workers-over-mercury-poisoning/?noredirect=on|title=After 15 years Unilever settles with Indian factory workers over mercury poisoning|date=19 March 2016|work=Washington Post|accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref>

===Palm oil===

In 2014, Unilever was criticised by [[Greenpeace]] for causing [[deforestation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/press-releases/unilever-admits-toxic-dumping-will-clean-up-but-not-come-clean|publisher=Greenpeace|title=Unilever admits toxic dumping: will clean up but not come clean|accessdate=7 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508042719/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/press-releases/unilever-admits-toxic-dumping-will-clean-up-but-not-come-clean|archivedate=8 May 2014}}</ref> In 2008, Greenpeace UK<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7358071.stm|title= Ape protest at Unilever factory|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 March 2008}}</ref> criticised the company for buying [[palm oil]] from suppliers that were damaging Indonesia's rainforests.<ref name="Palm Oil: Cooking the Climate">{{cite web|title=Palm Oil: Cooking the Climate|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/palm-oil_cooking-the-climate/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref> By 2008, Indonesia was losing 2% of its remaining rainforest each year, having the fastest deforestation rate of any country.

Furthermore, Indonesia was the 14th<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=CO2ts1990-2014&sort=des9|title=EDGAR – GHG (CO2, CH4, N2O, F-gases) emission time series 1990–2012 per region/country – European Commission|website=edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu|access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref> largest emitter of greenhouse gases, largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry, which contributed to 4% of global green house gas emissions.<ref name="Greenpeace International">{{cite web|title=How Unilever Palm Oil Suppliers are Burning Up Borneo|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/planet-2/report/2009/10/how-unilever-palm-oil-supplier.pdf|publisher=Greenpeace International|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref> According to [[Greenpeace]], palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected.<ref name="Greenpeace International"/> Plantations that were off-limits, by law, for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace.<ref name="Greenpeace International"/>

Unilever, as a founding member of the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] (RSPO), responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unilever.com/mediacentre/pressreleases/2008/Unilevercommitstocertifiedsustainablepalmoil.aspx |title=Unilever commits to certified sustainable palm oil &#124; Media centre &#124; Unilever Global |publisher=Unilever.com |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> It claims to have met this goal in 2012 and is encouraging the rest of the industry to become 100% sustainable by 2020.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unilever.com/Images/palm-oil-sourcing-position-statement_tcm244-423162_1.pdf | title=Unilever's Position on Palm Oil Sourcing | accessdate=7 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918215250/https://www.unilever.com/Images/palm-oil-sourcing-position-statement_tcm244-423162_1.pdf | archivedate=18 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In Côte d'Ivoire ([[Ivory Coast]]), one of Unilever's palm oil suppliers was accused of clearing forest for plantations, an activity that threatened a [[primate]] species, [[Miss Waldron's red colobus]]. Unilever intervened to halt the clearances pending the results of an environmental assessment.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.manifeste-fmt.org/updates.php | title=Manifesto for the Conservation of the Tanoé Swamps Forest | accessdate=19 July 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121162000/http://www.manifeste-fmt.org/updates.php | archivedate=21 November 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

According to an [[Amnesty International]] report published in 2016, Unilever's palm oil supplier [[Wilmar International]] profited from [[child labor]] and [[forced labor]]. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from banned chemicals. In 2016 Singapore-based Wilmar International was the world's biggest palm oil grower.<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/5184/2016/en/ The great palm oil scandal: Labour abuses behind big brand names] Amnesty International 30 November 2016</ref>

===Paper use===

For years, Unilever purchased paper for its packaging from [[Asia Pulp & Paper]], the third-largest paper producer in the world, which was labeled as a "forest criminal" for destroying "precious habitat" in Indonesia's rainforest.<ref name="Paper Giant Pledges to Leave the Poor Rainforest Alone.

=== Plastic pollution ===

In 2019, Unilever was cited by [[BreakFreeFromPlastic]] as one of the top ten global plastic polluters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90425011/coca-cola-nestle-and-pepsico-are-the-worlds-biggest-plastic-polluters-again|title=Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and PepsiCo are the world's biggest plastic polluters – again|last=Segran|first=Elizabeth|date=1 November 2019|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=17 February 2020}}</ref> Graham Forbes, Global Plastics Project Leader at [[Greenpeace]], said Unilever's plans to tackle this were the most ambitious he'd seen from a massive conglomerate. He also said that Unilever should commit to more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/unilever-acknowledges-reduction-and-new-business-models-are-critical-to-tackle-plastic-pollution/|title=Unilever acknowledges reduction and new business models are critical to tackle plastic pollution|website=Greenpeace |language=en-US|access-date=17 February 2020}}</ref>

===Rainforest Alliance===
{{Main|Rainforest Alliance#Criticism and response}}

Unilever certifies its tea products by the [[Rainforest Alliance]] scheme. The company has stated that at least 50% of the tea in its products originates from certified farms, compared to the Alliance's 30% minimum entry point. Unilever decided on the scheme over [[Fairtrade]], because according to the company's analysis, Fairtrade might "lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates".<ref>{{cite web | title=Unilever sustainable tea Part 1: Leapfrogging to mainstream | accessdate=15 March 2011 | url=https://saiplatform.org/uploads/Modules/Library/imd-casestudyunileversustainabletea.pdf }}</ref>

The Rainforest Alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price,<ref>Ethical Corporation (January 2005).

The Rainforest Alliance certification [[Rainforest Alliance#Use of seal|has furthermore been criticised]] for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of 30% of certified content, which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification.<ref name="transfairusa1">{{cite web|url=http://www.transfairusa.org/content/about/board.php |title=TransFair USA &#124; Board Members |date=27 June 2009 |accessdate=29 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109100107/http://www.transfairusa.org/content/about/board.php |archivedate=9 January 2011 }}</ref>
