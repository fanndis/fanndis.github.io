'''Proposition 22'''  was a law enacted by [[California]] voters in March 2000 stating that marriage was between one man and one woman. In November 2008, [[California Proposition 8|Proposition 8]] was also passed by voters, again only allowing marriage between one man and one woman. 

The Act was proposed by means of the [[initiative]] process. It was authored by state Senator [[William J. Knight|William "Pete" Knight]] and is known informally as the '''Knight initiative'''. Voters adopted the measure on March 7, 2000, with 61% in favor to 39% against.<ref>4,618,673 votes versus 2,909,370 against www.census.gov/census2000/states/ca.html.

The Act added Section 308.5 of the Family Code, which read "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California". Because the Act was an ordinary statute, it could be struck down if it were inconsistent with the state constitution, as happened on May 15, 2008, when the state supreme court, ruling in ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'', declared that same-sex couples had a constitutional right to marry.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/media/acrobat/2008-05/38894545.PDF California Supreme Court. ''re Marriage Cases'' (2008) 43 Cal.4th 757 (76 Cal.Rptr.3d 683, 183 P.3d 384)]</ref> This 4â€“3 decision invalidated Proposition 22 and some related California laws.

Proposition 22 provoked debate long after its passage. In November 2008 California voters overturned the ''In re Marriage Cases'' decision by approving an amendment of the state constitution called [[California Proposition 8|Proposition 8]]. In June 2010, Proposition 8 was declared unconstitutional by U.S district judge [[Vaughn Walker]] based on the [[Due Process]] and [[Equal Protection]] clauses of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] of the United States Constitution.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/08/prop8-gay-marriage.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=L.A.

Perry]]'' ruled that the Intervenor-Defendants had no [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] standing to appeal Walker's ruling, keeping Proposition 8 unenforceable throughout California and enabling same-sex marriage to resume just two days after the decision.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/28/proposition-8-gay-marriage_n_3519340.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Gay Marriages To Resume In California As Prop 8 Hold Lifted By Appeals Court | date=June 28, 2013}}</ref>

==Statutory framework==
Prior to 1977, marriage was defined in Section 4100 of the [[California Civil Code]]. This stated that marriage is "a personal relation arising out of a civil contract, to which consent of the parties making that contract is necessary".<ref>''Calif. Civil Code section 4100 prior to 1977:'' '''Stats. 1969, ch. 1608, s. 8,  p. 3314'''; ''amended to incorporate explicit gender requirement:'' '''Calif. Stats. 1977, ch. 339, s. 1, p. 1295'''; ''recodified at Calif. Family Code section 300 without substantive change:'' '''Calif. Stats. 1992, ch.162 s. 10, p. 474'''</ref> While related sections of the law made references to sex, a State Assembly committee that was debating adding sex-specific terms to this section in 1977 noted: "Under existing law it is not clear whether partners of the same sex can get married".<ref>California Assembly Committee on the Judiciary, Bill Digest for A.B. 607 (1977)</ref> That year, the legislature amended the legal definition of marriage to remove any ambiguity. In 1992 the legal definition of marriage was moved from the Civil Code to Section 300 of the Family Code.

When Proposition 22 came before voters, marriage was defined in the Family Code as "a personal relation arising out of a civil contract ''between a man and a woman,'' to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary" [''italics'' added].<ref>California Family Code, [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fam&group=00001-01000&file=300-310 Section 300] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630150250/http://leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fam&group=00001-01000&file=300-310 |date=2016-06-30 }}</ref>

Even though the definition governing who may marry explicitly precluded contracting a same-sex marriage in California, a separate provision, Section 308, governed recognition of marriages contracted elsewhere. This stated that a "marriage contracted outside this state that would be valid by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the marriage was contracted is valid in this state".<ref>California Family Code, [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fam&group=00001-01000&file=300-310 Section 308] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630150250/http://leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fam&group=00001-01000&file=300-310 |date=2016-06-30 }}</ref> Advocates of Proposition 22 described Section 308 as a "loophole", apparently forcing California to recognize a same-sex marriage validly contracted in some other state.<ref>2000 California Primary Election, Voter Information Guide, [http://primary2000.ss.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/22norbt.htm Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 22] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209164352/http://primary2000.ss.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/22norbt.htm |date=2006-12-09 }}</ref>

To address this, Proposition 22 did not reword the existing provisions of the Family Code, but added to them the declaration that "only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California".<ref>2000 California Primary Election, Voter Information Guide,  [http://primary2000.ss.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/22text.htm Text of Proposition 22] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040321065126/http://primary2000.ss.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/22text.htm |date=2004-03-21 }}</ref> The official citation of Proposition 22, the "California Defense of Marriage Act", is almost the same as that of a federal law, the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], which was enacted by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1996. This federal law had a similar purpose, and was intended to prevent any state from being obligated to recognize a same-sex marriage contracted in another state.

==Disputes over its effect==
Central to many subsequent disputes over Prop 22's effect is a distinction between statutes enacted by the legislature and initiative statutes enacted directly by the electorate.  The legislature is free to amend or rescind its own enactments, but voters must approve any attempt by the legislature to amend or repeal an initiative statute unless the initiative itself states otherwise.<ref>California Constitution, [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_2 Article II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008203818/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_2 |date=2010-10-08 }}, Section 10.</ref>

===Controversy over domestic partnerships===
{{see also|Domestic partnership in California}}
In 1999, California enacted the first in a series of [[domestic partnership]] provisions. California courts have entertained several challenges to legislative expansions of the domestic partnership scheme enacted after Prop 22. Generally, these challenges alleged that the legislature inappropriately amended Prop 22 by making California's domestic partnership scheme too similar to marriage, or more broadly, that Prop 22 made 'any' subsequent recognition of same-sex partnerships beyond the legislature's inherent power. [[California Courts of Appeal]] rejected those claims, noting that domestic partnerships already existed as a legal institution separate from marriage at the time Prop 22 was enacted.<ref>''Knight v. Superior Court'' (2005) [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/c048378.pdf 128 Cal.App.4th 18]; ''Armijo v. Miles'' (2005) [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/b166050.pdf 127 Cal.App.4th 1405]</ref>

===Controversy over marriage licensing within California===
{{main|Same-sex marriage in California}}
In September 2005, the [[California legislature]] passed a bill, A.B. 849, eliminating the gender requirements for marriage now found in Family Code section 300. Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] [[veto]]ed the bill.  In his veto message,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/ab_43_vt_20071012.html|title=AB 43 Assembly Bill - Veto|website=www.leginfo.ca.gov|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> Schwarzenegger argued that passing a law that would implicitly repeal Section 308.5 required the assent of the electorate (and separately made note of pending court challenges).<ref>Legislative history of [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=ab_849&sess=0506&house=B&author=leno A.B. 849 (2005)], Legislative Counsel of California.</ref>

In ruling on the disputes between Prop 22 and the domestic partnership enactments, [[California Courts of Appeal]] have reached differing conclusions as to Prop 22's scope within the marriage statutes.

In ''Armijo v. Miles,'' the Second Appellate District distinguished Prop 22 from the case at bar by noting, in part, that the initiative prevented the recognition of same-sex marriages conducted ''outside'' California:

<blockquote>The legislative analysis and the ballot arguments readily demonstrate that Proposition 22 was crafted with a prophylactic purpose in mind.  It was designed to prevent same-sex couples who could marry validly in other countries or who in the future could marry validly in other states from coming to California and claiming, in reliance on Family Code section 308, that their marriages must be recognized as valid marriages.  With the passage of Proposition 22, then, only opposite-sex marriages validly contracted outside this state will be recognized as valid in California.<ref>''Armijo v. Miles'' (2005) 127 Cal. App.4th 1405, 1424</ref></blockquote>

The ''Armijo'' court may not have ruled that the historical purpose of Prop 22 limited its scope to out of state marriages. The court appears to have ultimately presumed that Proposition 22 did indeed apply to in-state arrangements deemed to be "marriages," but held that the challenged wrongful death statute did not violate that prohibition:

<blockquote>The question remaining is whether the portion of AB 2580 that amends the wrongful death statute subverts Proposition 22.  Defendants' position that it does is based on the faulty premise that the right to sue for wrongful death is an exclusive benefit of marriage.  It is not.</blockquote>

Less than a week later, on April 4, 2005, the Third Appellate District ruled more explicitly, in ''Knight v. Superior Court,'' that Prop 22 also included within the initiative's ambit marriages licensed ''within'' the state:

<blockquote>The plain language of Proposition 22 and its initiative statute, section 308.5, reaffirms the definition of marriage in section 300, by stating that only marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid and recognized in California. This limitation ensures that California will not legitimize or recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions, as it otherwise would be required to do pursuant to section 308, and that California will not permit same-sex partners to validly marry within the state.<ref>''Knight v. Superior Court (Schwarzenegger)'' (2005) 128 Cal. App.4th 14, 23â€“24</ref></blockquote>

As with ''Armijo,'' the ''Knight'' court upheld the challenged statute on the grounds that it did not constitute a "marriage" for purposes of Prop 22 or Section 300.  The cases differed, however, in that ''Armijo'' appeared to rely on a narrow observation that a particular benefit was not exclusive to marriage, while ''Knight'' upheld a broad domestic partnership statute against challenges it left almost no substantive difference between the two institutions.  Parties in subsequent cases, including the same-sex marriage cases, have noted the apparent split between the appellate courts with respect to its scope.

As the ultimate rulings in these cases arguably did not require a finding that Prop 22 applies to in-state marriages (both were upheld against a challenge that they constituted marriage under Prop 22, the same result that would have obtained if they had ruled Prop 22 did not apply to in-state marriages), some argue that these findings are [[dicta]].<ref>Liebert, Mark.

''Citations'' (Ventura County Bar Association), Oct 2005.</ref>  On the flip side, an argument can be made that these holdings are ''not'' dicta, as both courts ruled on the merits of whether or not a challenged in-state arrangement constituted a "marriage" for purposes of Prop 22, an allegation that would be moot if either court believed Prop 22 permitted in-state marriages.

In 2008, the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] resolved the controversy in ruling on the constitutionality of statutes limiting marriage to a man and a woman: "this provision reasonably must be interpreted to apply both to marriages performed in California and those performed in other jurisdictions."<ref name="scoca">{{cite web |url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S147999.PDF |format=PDF|title=Opinion ''In re Marriage Cases'' |date=2008-05-15 |publisher=Supreme Court of California| access-date=2008-06-05 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080603070921/http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S147999.PDF <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-06-03}}</ref>

==Invalidation==

Separately, numerous challenges to the constitutionality of the opposite-sex requirements found in California's marriage statutes, including Prop 22, came before the courts. A [[San Francisco]] trial court threw out all of the gender requirements on state constitutional grounds. On appeal, an intermediate court reversed that decision. In December 2006, the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] voted unanimously to review all six cases and held oral argument on March 4, 2008, consolidating the cases as ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=447693&doc_no=S147999|title=California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information|website=appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov}}</ref>  The Court ruled on May 15, 2008, that Proposition 22 violated the state Constitution and was therefore invalid.<ref>http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/15/BAGAVNC5K.DTL (San Francisco Chronicle)</ref> [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] immediately issued a statement pledging to uphold the ruling, and repeated his pledge to oppose [[California Proposition 8|Proposition 8]], a constitutional amendment initiative that would override the Court's ruling and again ban same sex marriages by placing the text of Proposition 22 in the [[California Constitution|State Constitution]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/05/15/state/n113018D48.DTL|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Schwarzenegger says he respects court's marriage ruling|date=May 15, 2008|access-date=2008-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519201115/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2008%2F05%2F15%2Fstate%2Fn113018D48.DTL|archive-date=2008-05-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>
