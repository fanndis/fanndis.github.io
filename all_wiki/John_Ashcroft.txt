'''John David Ashcroft''' (born May 9, 1942) is an American lawyer, lobbyist, songwriter and former politician who served as the 79th [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] (2001–2005), in the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush Administration]]. He later founded The Ashcroft Group, a Washington D.C. lobbying firm.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/politics/same-washington-different-office.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Leslie |last=Wayne |title=Same Washington, Different Office |date=March 17, 2006 |accessdate=February 22, 2019 }}</ref>

Ashcroft previously served as [[Attorney General of Missouri]] (1976–1985), and as the [[List of governors of Missouri|50th Governor of Missouri]] (1985–1993), having been elected for two consecutive terms in succession (a historical first for a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate in the state), and he also served as a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Missouri]] (1995–2001). He had early appointments in Missouri state government and was mentored by [[John Danforth]]. He has written several books about politics and [[ethics]]. Since 2011 he sits on the board of directors for the
[[private military company]] [[Academi]] (formerly [[Blackwater (company)|Blackwater]]), has been a member of the [[Federalist Society]], and is a professor at the [[Regent University School of Law]], a conservative Christian institution affiliated with [[Televangelism|televangelist]] [[Pat Robertson]].

His son, [[Jay Ashcroft]], is also a politician, serving as [[List of Missouri Secretaries of State|Secretary of State of Missouri]]  since January, 2017.

==Early life and education==
Ashcroft was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the son of Grace P. (née Larsen) and James Robert Ashcroft. The family later lived in [[Springfield, Missouri]], where his father was a minister in an [[Assemblies of God USA|Assemblies of God]] congregation, served as president of [[Evangel University]] (1958–74), and jointly as President of [[Central Bible College]] (1958–63). His mother was a homemaker, whose parents had emigrated from [[Norway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/ashcroft.html |title=Ancestry of John Ashcroft |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2011 |first=William Addams |last=Reitwiesner |authorlink=William Addams Reitwiesner }}</ref> His paternal grandfather was an Irish immigrant.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|title=Ashcroft's Ascent|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/04/15/ashcrofts-ascent|access-date=2020-07-22|website=The New Yorker|language=en-us}}</ref>

Ashcroft graduated from [[Hillcrest High School (Springfield, Missouri)|Hillcrest High School]] in 1960.<ref>[https://www.ksmu.org/post/springfield-public-schools-hall-fame-has-three-inductees#stream/0]</ref> He attended [[Yale University]], where he was a member of the [[St. Elmo (secret society)|St. Elmo Society]], graduating in 1964. He received a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[University of Chicago School of Law]] (1967).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=A000356 |title=Ashcroft, John David – Biographical Information |publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref>

After law school, Ashcroft briefly taught Business Law and worked as an administrator at [[Southwest Missouri State University]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], he was not drafted because he received six student [[Selective Service System#Classifications|draft deferments]] and one occupational deferment because of his teaching work.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Robbins |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2004/08/17/the-sunshine-patriots/ |title=The Sunshine Patriots |work=[[Village Voice]] |date=August 17, 2004 |accessdate=February 22, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/27/opinion/where-is-the-shame.html |first=Bob |last=Herbert |authorlink=Bob Herbert |title=Where Is The Shame? |date=August 27, 2004 |accessdate=August 20, 2018 }}</ref>

==Political career==

===Missouri State Auditor===
In 1972, Ashcroft ran for a [[United States Congress|Congressional]] seat in southwest Missouri in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[primary election]], narrowly losing to [[Gene Taylor (Missouri)|Gene Taylor]]. After the primary, Missouri Governor [[Kit Bond]] appointed Ashcroft to the office of State Auditor, which Bond had vacated when he became governor.

In 1974, Ashcroft was narrowly defeated for election to that post by [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] [[List of county executives of Jackson County, Missouri|County Executive]] [[George W. Lehr]]. He had argued that Ashcroft, who is not an accountant, was not qualified to be the State Auditor.

===Attorney General of Missouri===
[[File:Reagan Contact Sheet C20739 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Ashcroft with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984]]
[[Missouri Attorney General]] [[John Danforth]], who was then in his second term, hired Ashcroft as an Assistant State Attorney General. During his service, Ashcroft shared an office with [[Clarence Thomas]], a future [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court Justice]]. (In 2001, Thomas administered Ashcroft's [[oath of office]] as U.S. Attorney General.)

In 1976, Danforth was elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], and Ashcroft was elected to replace him as State Attorney General. He was sworn in on December 27, 1976.  In 1980, Ashcroft was re-elected with 64.5 percent of the vote, winning 96 of Missouri's 114 counties.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book |page=73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4OZ-Z790DEC&pg=PA73 |editor1-first=Thad L. |editor1-last=Beyle |first1=Dean L. |last1=Yarwood |first2=Richard J. |last2=Hardy |contribution=The Norm of Standing Aside: Gubernatorial Transition in Missouri in 1984 |title=Gubernatorial Transitions: The 1983 and 1984 Elections |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-8223-0858-4 }}</ref>

In 1983, Ashcroft wrote the leading ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief in the U.S. Supreme Court Case ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]'', supporting the use of video cassette recorders for time shifting of television programs.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Sony Corp. of America v.

===Governor of Missouri (1985–1993)===

[[File:Bush Contact Sheet P19270 (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Ashcroft with [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1991]]
Ashcroft was elected governor in [[1984 Missouri gubernatorial election|1984]] and re-elected in [[1988 Missouri gubernatorial election|1988]], becoming the first (and, to date, the only) Republican in Missouri history elected to two consecutive terms.

Mrs. Bush (in rocking chair) is reading ''[[Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?|Brown Bear, Brown Bear]]'' to the children.]]

In 1984, his opponent was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|Lt. Governor]] [[Ken Rothman]]. The campaign was so negative on both sides that a reporter described the contest as "two alley cats [scrapping] over truth in advertising". In his campaign ads, Ashcroft showed the contrast between his rural-base and the supporters of his urban-based opponent from [[St. Louis]]. Democrats did not close ranks on primary night. The defeated candidate [[Mel Carnahan]] endorsed Rothman. In the end, Ashcroft won 57 percent of the vote and carried 106 counties—then the largest Republican gubernatorial victory in Missouri history.<ref name="books.google.com"/>

In 1988, Ashcroft won by a larger margin over his Democratic opponent, [[Betty Cooper Hearnes]], the wife of the former governor [[Warren Hearnes]]. Ashcroft received 64 percent of the vote in the general election—the largest landslide for governor in Missouri history since the U.S. Civil War.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/biographicaldire0000mull |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/biographicaldire0000mull/page/217 217] |first=Marie Marmo |last=Mullaney |title=Biographical directory of the governors of the United States, 1988–1994 |publisher=Greenwood Press |date=1994 |isbn=0-313-28312-5 }}</ref>

During his second term, Ashcroft served as chairman of the [[National Governors Association]] (1991–92).

===U.S. Senator from Missouri===
[[File:Senator John Ashcroft3.jpg|thumb|Ashcroft's official portrait as Senator]]
In [[1994 United States Senate election in Missouri|1994]] Ashcroft was elected to the U.S. Senate from Missouri, again succeeding [[John Danforth]], who retired from the position. Ashcroft won 59.8% of the vote against Democratic Congressman [[Alan Wheat]]. As Senator:
* He opposed the [[Clinton Administration]]'s [[Clipper chip|Clipper]] encryption restrictions, arguing in favor of the individual's right to encrypt messages and export encryption software.
* In 1999, as chair of the Senate's subcommittee on patents, he helped extend patents for several drugs, most significantly the allergy medication [[Claritin]], to prevent the marketing of less-expensive [[generic drug|generics]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Bruce |last=Shapiro |url=https://www.salon.com/2001/01/16/hearings/ |title=Can John Ashcroft be stopped? |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=January 16, 2001 |accessdate=May 28, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523090051/http://archive.salon.com/politics/feature/2001/01/16/hearings/print.html |archivedate=May 23, 2009}}</ref>
* On March 30, 2000, with Senator [[Russ Feingold]], Ashcroft convened the only Senate hearing on [[racial profiling]]. He said the practice was unconstitutional and that he supported legislation requiring police to keep statistics on their actions.

In 1998, Ashcroft briefly considered running for U.S. President; but on January 5, 1999, he decided that he would seek re-election to his Senate seat in the [[2000 United States Senate election in Missouri|2000 election]] and not run for president.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/01/05/president.2000/ashcroft/ |title=Ashcroft decides not to jump into 2000 race |publisher=Cnn.com |date=January 5, 1999 |accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref> 

In the Republican primary, Ashcroft defeated [[Marc Perkel]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/KC/lib00143,0EAF48A93360AB34.html |title=Ashcroft, Carnahan take sizable leads |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |via=NewsBank |date=August 9, 2000 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419173357/https://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&p_theme=kc&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF48A93360AB34&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |archive-date=2019-04-19 |quote=With more than 60 percent of the precincts reporting, Ashcroft, a Republican, had captured 90 percent of the vote, to 10 percent for [[Marc Perkel]] of Springfield.

In the midst of a tight race, Carnahan died in an airplane crash three weeks prior to the election. Ashcroft suspended all campaigning after the plane crash. Because of Missouri state election laws and the short time to election, Carnahan's name remained on the ballot. Lieutenant Governor [[Roger B. Wilson]] became governor upon Carnahan's death. Wilson said that should Carnahan be elected, he wanted to appoint his widow, [[Jean Carnahan]], to serve in her husband's place; Mrs. Carnahan stated that, in accordance with her late husband's goal, she would serve in the Senate if voters elected his name. Following these developments, Ashcroft resumed campaigning.<ref>{{Cite news|title=In Missouri, Campaign Flourishes After the Death of the Candidate |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/31/us/2000-campaign-missouri-senate-race-missouri-campaign-flourishes-after-death.html?ref=jeancarnahan|date=October 31, 2000|first=Neil A.|last=Lewis|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref>

Carnahan won the election 51% to 49%.

[[File:John Ashcroft '05.jpg|thumb|right|Ashcroft in 2005]]
In December 2000, following his Senatorial defeat, Ashcroft was chosen for the position of U.S. attorney general by president-elect [[George W. Bush]]. He was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 58 to 42, with most [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] senators voting against him, citing his prior opposition to using forced busing to achieve [[desegregation]], and their opposition to Ashcroft's [[Anti-abortion movement|opposition to abortion]]. At the time of his appointment he was known to be a member of the [[Federalist Society]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/04/18/federalist-society-becomes-a-force-in-washington/9eb2f353-2f3c-4724-ba5c-094736a9a434 |title=Federalist Society Becomes a Force in Washington |last=Edsall |first=Thomas B. |date=April 18, 2001 |website=Washington Post |language=en-US |access-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref>

In May 2001, the FBI revealed that they had misplaced thousands of documents related to the investigation of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]]. Ashcroft granted a 30-day stay of execution for [[Timothy McVeigh]], the man sentenced to death for the bombing.

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States, Ashcroft was a key administration supporter of passage of the [[USA Patriot Act]]. One of its provisions, Section 215, allows the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) to apply for an order from the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] to require production of "any tangible thing" for an investigation. This provision was criticized by citizen and professional groups concerned about violations of privacy. Ashcroft referred to the [[American Library Association]]'s opposition to Section 215 as "hysteria" in two separate speeches given in September 2003.<ref>{{cite web | author = Ashcroft, John & DOJ Staff | date = September 15, 2003 | title = Prepared Remarks of Attorney General John Ashcroft: The Proven Tactics in the Fight against Crime | location = Washington, D.C. | url = https://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2003/091503nationalrestaurant.htm | publisher = Justice.gov |accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author = Ashcroft, John & DOJ Staff | date = September 18, 2003 | title = Remarks of Attorney General John Ashcroft: Protecting Life and Liberty | location = Memphis, TN | url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2003/091803memphisremarks.htm |publisher=Justice.gov |accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref> While Attorney General, Ashcroft consistently denied that the FBI or any other law enforcement agency had used the Patriot Act to obtain library circulation records or those of retail sales. According to the sworn testimony of two FBI agents interviewed by the [[9/11 Commission]], Ashcroft ignored warnings of an imminent al-Qaida attack.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Myers|first1=Lisa|title=Did Ashcroft brush off terror warnings?|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5271234/ns/nbc_nightly_news_with_brian_williams/t/did-ashcroft-brush-terror-warnings/ |accessdate=October 3, 2014|publisher=NBC News|date=June 22, 2005}}</ref>

In January 2002, the partially nude female statue of the ''[[Spirit of Justice]]'' in the [[Robert F.

Ashcroft pushed his U.S. attorneys to pursue voter fraud cases.

In July 2002, Ashcroft proposed the creation of [[Operation TIPS]], a domestic program in which workers and government employees would inform law enforcement agencies about suspicious behavior they encounter while performing their duties. The program was widely criticized from the beginning, with critics deriding the program as essentially a Domestic Informant Network along the lines of the East German [[Stasi]] or the Soviet [[KGB]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://archive.commondreams.org/views02/0717-01.htm |title=Ashcroft vs. Americans |date=August 4, 2007 |work=[[Common Dreams]] |accessdate=August 17, 2018 |author=Editorial Board }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://reason.com/archives/2002/07/16/an-american-stasi |title=An American Stasi |first=Brian |last=Doherty |authorlink=Brian Doherty (journalist) |date=July 16, 2002 |work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |accessdate=August 17, 2018 }}</ref> and an encroachment upon the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth]] amendments.

In 2009 in ''[[Ashcroft v. al-Kidd]]'', the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[San Francisco]] found that Ashcroft could be sued and held personally responsible for the wrongful detention of Abdullah al-Kidd. The American citizen was arrested at [[Dulles Airport]] in March 2003 on his way to Saudi Arabia for study. He was held for 15 days in maximum security in three states, and 13 months in supervised release, to be used as a material witness in the trial of [[Sami Omar Al-Hussayen]]. (The latter was acquitted of all charges of supporting terrorism). Al-Kidd was never charged and was not called as a witness in the Al-Hussayen case.)<ref name="Barnes">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/18/AR2010101802032.html |first=Robert |last=Barnes |title=Supreme Court to decide whether Ashcroft can be sued by detained citizen |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 18, 2012 |accessdate=January 17, 2013 }}</ref>

The panels court described the government's assertions under the [[USA Patriot Act]] (2001) as "repugnant of the Constitution". In a detailed and at times passionate opinion, Judge [[Milan Smith]] likened allegations against al-Kidd as similar to the repressive practices of the British Crown that sparked the American Revolution.

He asserts that Ashcroft violated his civil liberties as an American citizen, as he was treated like a terrorist and not allowed to consult an attorney. Al-Kidd's lawyers say Ashcroft, as US Attorney General, encouraged authorities after 9/11 to arrest potential suspects as material witnesses when they lacked [[probable cause]] to believe the suspects had committed a crime.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304410504575560020403737414|title=Justices to Hear Ashcroft Appeal|newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=October 18, 2010|accessdate=October 19, 2010|first=Jess|last=Bravin}}</ref>

The US Supreme Court agreed on October 18, 2010 to hear the case.

[[Tommy Chong]], a counterculture icon, was one of those charged, for his part in financing and promoting Chong Glass/Nice Dreams, a company started by his son Paris. Of the 55 individuals charged as a result of the operations, only Chong was given a prison sentence after conviction (nine months in a federal prison, plus forfeiting $103,000 and a year of probation). The other 54 individuals were given fines and home detentions. While the DOJ denied that Chong was treated any differently from the other defendants, critics thought the government was trying to make an example of him. Chong's experience as a target of Ashcroft's sting operation is the subject of [[Josh Gilbert (filmmaker)|Josh Gilbert's]] feature-length documentary ''[[a/k/a Tommy Chong]]'', which premiered at the [[2005 Toronto International Film Festival]].

Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the [[House Judiciary Committee]], asked, in a statement, for a formal investigation of the time between the start of Rove's investigation and John Ashcroft's [[recusal]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2005/08/09/what-now-karl/ |title=What Now, Karl? |work=[[Village Voice]] |date=August 9, 2005 |accessdate=August 17, 2018 |first=Murray S. |last=Waas}}</ref>

Since his service in government, Ashcroft has continued to oppose proposals for [[physician-assisted suicide]], which some states have passed by referenda. When interviewed about it in 2012, when a case had reached the US Supreme Court after California voters had approved a law to permit it under regulated conditions, he said,

==Representation in other media==
* His song, "Let the Eagle Soar", was satirically featured in [[Michael Moore]]'s 2004 movie ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' and has been frequently mocked by comedians such as [[David Letterman]], [[Stephen Colbert]] and [[David Cross]], to name a few.
* The song was performed at Bush's 2005 inauguration by [[Guy Hovis]], a former cast member of ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]''.
*"Let the Eagle Soar" is heard in the background in the 2015 film ''[[The Big Short (film)|The Big Short]]'', as an ironic juxtaposition of schmaltzy music and new-age capitalist sensibility when a phone call is placed to pastoral [[Boulder, Colorado]], where anti-authoritarian ex-banking trader Ben Rickert (played by [[Brad Pitt]]) lives.
* The song “Caped Crusader” off of [[Jello Biafra]] and [[The Melvins]]’ 2004 album “[[Never Breathe What You Can't See]]” lifts several lines from Ashcroft and 9/11 hijacker [[Mohamed Atta]] in a satirical attack on religious fundamentalism.
