'''Julie Nixon Eisenhower ''' (born July 5, 1948) is an American author who is the younger daughter of [[Richard Nixon]], [[List of Presidents of the United States#List of presidents|37th]] [[President of the United States]], and [[Pat Nixon]], [[First Lady of the United States]], and is the wife of [[Dwight David Eisenhower II|David Eisenhower]], grandson of President Eisenhower.

Born in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1948, while her father was a [[Member of Congress|Congressman]], Julie and her elder sister, [[Patricia Nixon Cox]], grew up in the public eye. Her father was elected [[U.S. Senator]] from [[California]] when she was two and [[Vice President of the United States]] when she was four. Her 1968 marriage to [[David Eisenhower]], grandson of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], was seen as a union between two of the most prominent [[List of United States political families|political families in the United States]].

Throughout the [[Nixon administration]] (1969 to 1974), Julie worked as Assistant Managing Editor of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' while holding the unofficial title of "First Daughter." She was widely noted as one of her father's most vocal and active defenders and was named one of the "Ten Most Admired Women in America" for four years by readers of ''Good Housekeeping'' magazine in the 1970s. After her father resigned from the presidency in 1974, she wrote a biography of her mother, the ''New York Times'' best-seller ''Pat Nixon: The Untold Story''. She continues to engage in works that support her parents' legacies and is on the board of directors of the [[Richard Nixon Foundation]].

She is the mother of two daughters, [[Jennie Eisenhower]] and Melanie Catherine Eisenhower, and a son, Alex Eisenhower.

==Early life==
Julie Nixon was born while her father, [[Richard Nixon]], was a [[Member of Congress|Congressman]], but much of her childhood coincided with her father's service as [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s [[Vice-President of the United States|Vice-President]] (1953â€“61).  She recalled her father as being romantic, while her mother was "practical and down to earth".<ref name=JulieRemembers /> Her mother tried to "seal" her and her sister from much of her father's political career.<ref>Pat Nixon A&E Biography</ref> At his second inauguration, President Eisenhower suggested to 8-year-old Julie as their photograph was being taken, to hide a black eye (which she had acquired in a sledding accident) by turning her head. She turned her head towards David, which made it appear that he had been staring directly at her.<ref>Frank, pp.{{nbsp}}286-287.</ref> Her grandmother [[Hannah Milhous Nixon|Hannah Nixon]] would come to watch her and her sister whenever her parents traveled.<ref>Frank, p. 76.</ref> As a child, one of her favorite pets was a [[cocker spaniel]] named Checkers, who figured prominently in [[Checkers speech|one of her father's most famous speeches]], given during his 1952 campaign for [[Vice President of the United States]].

During the Vice Presidency, she attended the private [[Sidwell Friends School]] in Washington along with her sister, Tricia.  After her father lost the [[1960 United States presidential election|Presidential Election of 1960]] to [[John F. Kennedy]], Julie felt "battered" by the results and felt that the votes had "been stolen".<ref name=JulieRemembers>{{cite news|url=http://foxnewsinsider.com/2012/04/08/julie-nixon-eisenhower-remembers-her-mother-pat-on-the-centennial-of-her-birth |title=Julie Nixon Eisenhower Remembers Her Mother and Former First Lady Pat on the Centennial of Her Birth |date=April 8, 2012 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131126003950/http://foxnewsinsider.com/2012/04/08/julie-nixon-eisenhower-remembers-her-mother-pat-on-the-centennial-of-her-birth |archivedate=November 26, 2013 }}</ref>

After her father lost his presidential bid in 1960 the family returned to California, where her father ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1962. The Nixons then moved to New York after the gubernatorial race, and Julie attended [[Smith College]] after her graduation from the [[Chapin School]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19681123&id=Q_4gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3XUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5966,3926326&hl=en]</ref> She received a [[master's degree]] in education from [[The Catholic University of America]] in 1971. When she was at Smith, [[David Eisenhower]], the grandson of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], attended [[Amherst College]] nearby. Julie and David were both invited to address the Hadley Republican Women's Club. The club learned that the two were only seven miles apart, and invited them to be featured speakers.<ref>Wead, p. 261.</ref> They discussed the invitations and both chose to decline, but would come in contact again when David visited Julie with his roommate from Amherst and took her and a friend out to get some ice cream. David reflected: "I was broke, my roommate forgot his wallet. The girls paid."<ref>Gibbs, p. 253.</ref>

==Marriage==

She began dating David Eisenhower in the fall of 1966 when both were freshmen at [[Smith College]] and [[Amherst College]], respectively. She became engaged to him a year later.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2013/02/15/eisenhower-and-nixon-secrets-of-an-unlikely-pair| title=Eisenhower and Nixon: Secrets of an Unlikely Pair| date=February 15, 2013| first=Brooke| last=Berger| publisher=[[U.S. News]]}}</ref> Both Julie and David have admitted that [[Mamie Eisenhower]] played a major part in their relationship.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fM0gRt2YU4| title=Gloria Greer with Julie Nixon Eisenhower| date=February 2, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN6nksXUDFg| title=An Evening with David and Julie Eisenhower| date=January 26, 2012}}</ref> In 1966 during the funeral for [[Raymond Pitcairn]], a friend of the Nixons, Julie mentioned to Mamie that she would be attending Smith College. Mamie told her of David's plans to go to [[Amherst College]], and soon started trying to get David to call on her.<ref>Eisenhower, p. 210.</ref>

In 1966, Julie Nixon was presented as a [[debutante]] to [[High society (social class)|high society]] at the [[International Debutante Ball]] at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York City. David Eisenhower was her civilian escort at the International Debutante Ball.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yazigi|first1=Monique|title=The Debutante Returns, With Pearls and Plans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/01/nyregion/the-debutante-returns-with-pearls-and-plans.html|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>

On December 22, 1968, after her father was elected president but before he took office, Julie married David. They both decided they did not want the publicity of a White House wedding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eisenhower|first1=Julie|title=Pat Nixon the Untold Story|date=1986|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=1416576053}}</ref> The Reverend [[Norman Vincent Peale]] officiated in the non-denominational rite at the [[Marble Collegiate Church]] in [[New York City]].

The couple left from Massachusetts in 1970 when their classes there were canceled after the [[Kent State shootings]].

==First daughter==
During the [[1968 United States presidential election|United States presidential election of 1968]], when her father was the Republican nominee, Julie began to feel that she was not active enough in her father's campaign and worried over what she believed was [[Hubert Humphrey]]'s popularity at [[Smith College]], which she was attending at the time.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://nixonfamily.20m.com/art1.html| title=My College Diary by Julie Nixon Eisenhower}}</ref> She took an active role in his campaign, and shook hands for hours while greeting people. Despite not liking the publicity and hating to answer "personal questions," she did anything she could to help her father.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1898&dat=19680304&id=-BBJAAAAIBAJ&pg=4885,535737| title=Julie Nixon 'Will Do Anything' To Help Her Father's Campaign| date=March 4, 1968| newspaper=[[The Norwalk Hour]]}}</ref>

While her father served as President (1969â€“74), Julie became active at the [[White House]] as a spokesperson for children's issues, the environment, and the elderly. She gave tours to disabled children, filled in for her mother at events, and took an active interest in foreign policy.  She and Tricia were placed in charge of [[Caroline Kennedy]] and [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]], when they visited the White House in 1971. The sisters took the young Kennedys on a tour of their former residence, which included going to their old bedrooms and to the [[Oval Office]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Leigh |first=Wendy |title=Prince Charming: The John F.

In 1971, when David was assigned to the [[Mayport, Florida]]-based {{USS|Albany|CA-123}}, they moved to the Jacksonville beach community of [[Atlantic Beach, Florida]]. She had been hired to teach third grade at Atlantic Beach Elementary School beginning that fall, but she had to quit when she broke her toe just before classes were to start. The Eisenhowers continued to live in Atlantic Beach until 1973, even hosting the President and the First Lady at their beachfront garage apartment on Beach Avenue.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/062602/met_9762171.html#.VfIKR9JVikp |title=Nixon daughter fondly recalls First Coast |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]] |first=Jessie-Lynne | last=Kerr |date=26 June 2002}}</ref>

During 1973â€“75, she served as Assistant Managing Editor of the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' and helped establish a book division for Curtis Publishing Co., its parent corporation. It was during this time that Julie wrote the book ''Eye On Nixon'', full of photographs of her father's first administration. 

After the news of the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate break-in]] and suspicions that it might reach as high as the Oval Office began to mount, Julie took on the press at home and abroad. Journalist [[Nora Ephron]] wrote, "In the months since the [[Watergate hearings]] began, she [Julie] has become her father's ... [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] in practice if not in fact."<ref name="lonely">David, Lester and Thomas Y. Crowell. ''The Lonely Lady of San Clemente''. New York, 1978. p. 172-174.</ref>

Taking on the "role of trying to explain her father to the world",<ref>Marton, p.{{nbsp}}193.</ref> Julie's public defense of her father began at [[Walt Disney World]] on May 2, 1973. She gave a total of 138 interviews across the country. On July 4, 1973, she told two reporters that her father had considered resigning over Watergate, but that the family had talked him out of it.<ref name="lonely"/> On May 7, 1974, Julie and David met with the press in the [[East Garden of the White House]]. She announced that the President planned "... to take this constitutionally down to the wire."<ref name="lonely"/> Just before noon on August 9, 1974, Julie stood behind her father while he gave his goodbye speech to the White House staff. She would later say it was the hardest moment for him.<ref name="lonely"/>

==Life after the White House==

Julie and David settled in [[Berwyn, Pennsylvania]], where she completed several books, including ''Pat Nixon: The Untold Story'' and ''Going Home to Glory; A Memoir of Life with Dwight D. Eisenhower'', written with her husband David Eisenhower. She has an extensive record of community service and a special interest in at-risk youth.  For over twenty years she served on the Board of Directors for [[Jobs for America's Graduates]], a national organization that helps young people graduate from high school and transition into a first job.  She was named a Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania for her civic contributions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Records of the Distinguished Daughters of Pennsylvania|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/mg/mg524.htm|website=[[PA State Archives]]}}</ref> She is active with the [[Richard Nixon Foundation]], sitting on its board.

In 2001, she expressed interest in exhuming the body of Checkers, a dog attributed to her father's career when he campaigned for vice president that died in 1964.

She and her sister got into a legal battle over an estimated "as-high-as" $19 million, left by [[Bebe Rebozo]] for the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace Foundation. As opposed to Tricia's wish for the money to be controlled by a group affiliated with their family, Julie wanted it to be controlled by the library's board.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-03-26/features/0203260021_1_bebe-rebozo-nixon-daughters-nixon-family| title=What Nixon's best friend couldn't buy| date=March 26, 2002| first=Bob| last=Greene| work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> On the relationship strain the two were experiencing during the dispute, Julie said "I think it is very sad"<ref name="Nixon Daughters burnish legacy">{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002/04/30/nixon.htm| title=Family feud stains efforts to burnish Nixon's legacy| work=[[USA Today]]| first=Martin| last=Kasindorf| date=April 29, 2002}}</ref> and stated, "It's very heartbreaking because I love my sister very much".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/20/local/me-nixon20| title=Views Emerge in Rift Between Nixon Sisters| date=March 2, 2002| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| first1=Stuart| last1=Pfeifer| first2=John J.| last2=Goldman| first3=Phil| last3=Willon}}</ref> Ultimately, the lawsuit was settled to the satisfaction of both sides.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Nixon-s-daughters-end-rift-over-gift-2785499.php|title=Nixon's daughters end rift over gift|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|last1=Sterngold|first1=James|date=August 9, 2002}}</ref>

One of Eisenhower's fondest wishes was for the Nixon Library to join the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]-administered [[system of Presidential Libraries]]:

<blockquote>It's not right, struggling for the money. My father should be in the system. As long as he's on the outside, historians will continue to look at him, I feel, in a more negative light. There is always going to be negativity, but he has to be part of the continuum of presidents.<ref name="Nixon Daughters burnish legacy" /></blockquote>

Due in large part to advocating by Julie Eisenhower, the Nixon Library became part of the National Archives system in July 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Library History|url=https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/aboutus/laws/libraryhistory.php|website=nixonlibrary.gov|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref>
