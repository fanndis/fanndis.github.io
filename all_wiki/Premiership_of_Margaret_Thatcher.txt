[[Margaret Thatcher]] served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1979 to 1990. She was [[1979 United Kingdom general election|elected]] to the position in [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]], having led the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] since 1975, and won landslide re-elections in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]].  She gained intense media attention as Britain's first female prime minister, though she did not make [[women's issues]] a priority.<ref name="auto">{{citation |first=Beatrix |last=Campbell |title=Margaret Thatcher: To be or not to be a woman |journal=British Politics |volume=10 |number=1 |year=2015 |pages=41–51|doi=10.1057/bp.2014.27 |s2cid=143944033 }}</ref> 

In domestic policy, Thatcher implemented sweeping reforms concerning the [[Economy of the United Kingdom#1979 to 1997|affairs of the economy]], eventually including the [[#Privatisation|privatisation of most nationalised industries]],<ref>{{citation |first=David |last=Marsh |title=Privatization under Mrs. Thatcher: a review of the literature |journal=Public Administration |volume=69 |number=4 |year=1991 |pages=459–480|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9299.1991.tb00915.x }}</ref> as well as weakening of trade unions.<ref>{{citation |first=Peter |last=Dorey |title=Weakening the Trade Unions, One Step at a Time: The Thatcher Governments' Strategy for the Reform of Trade-Union Law, 1979–1984 |journal=Historical Studies in Industrial Relations |volume=37 |year=2016 |pages=169–200 |doi=10.3828/hsir.2016.37.6 |url=https://www.academia.edu/download/53607746/HSIR_2016.pdf }}</ref> She emphasised reducing the government's role and letting the marketplace decide in terms of the [[neoliberal]] ideas pioneered by [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], promoted by her advisor [[Keith Joseph]], and promulgated by the media as [[Thatcherism]].<ref name="Evans2018">{{citation|last=Evans|first=Eric J. |authorlink=Eric J.

In foreign policy, Thatcher decisively defeated Argentina in the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. In longer-range terms she worked with [[Ronald Reagan]] to wage the [[second Cold War]] escalation against Communism. However she also promoted collaboration with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in [[End of the Cold War|ending the Cold War]].<ref name="Brown2020">{{citation|last=Brown|first=Archie|title=The Human Factor: Gorbachev, Reagan, and Thatcher, and the End of the Cold War|url={{GBurl|id=LcjXDwAAQBAJ}}|url-access=limited|year=2020|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-106561-3}}</ref>

In her first years she had a deeply divided cabinet.  As the leader of the [[Wets and dries|"dry" faction]] she purged most of the [[One-nation conservatism|One Nation]] "wet" Conservatives and took full control.<ref name="Evans2004">{{citation|last=Evans|first=Eric J. |title=Thatcher and Thatcherism|url={{GBurl|id=erQ2gUQGTaMC}}|url-access=limited|edition=reprint, revised|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-27013-7}}</ref>{{rp|34}} By the late 1980s, however, she had alienated several senior members of her Cabinet with her opposition to greater economic integration into the [[European Economic Community]]. She also alienated many Conservative voters and parliamentarians with the imposition of a [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|local poll tax]]. As her support ebbed away, she was [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|challenged for her leadership]] and persuaded by Cabinet to withdraw from the second round of voting &ndash; ending her eleven-year premiership.

Domestically, Thatcher remains a highly controversial and polarising figure;<ref>{{citation |last=Stewart |first=Dan |url=http://theweek.com/articles/465801/why-margaret-thatcher-loved--hated |title=Why Margaret Thatcher was loved{{snd}}and hated |date=8 April 2013 |magazine=The Week |access-date=18 May 2017}}</ref> notwithstanding this, historians and political scientists usually [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the United Kingdom|rank]] her as an above-average prime minister.<ref>{{citation |title=Churchill 'greatest PM of 20th Century'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/579061.stm|access-date=30 August 2016|work=BBC News |date=26 December 1999|quote=[[David Lloyd George]] took over as PM at the height of the First World War, replacing another contender, [[Herbert Henry Asquith]].

==First term (1979–1983)==
{{Further|First Thatcher ministry}}
Thatcher was Britain's first woman prime minister, and indeed the first in a major country.{{efn|For an overview, see {{harvcoltxt|Sked|Cook|1993|pp=329–439}}.}}  Thatcher appointed few women to high office and did not make women's issues a priority.<ref name="auto"/> Nevertheless her pioneering role was widely hailed as an achievement for women in general.<ref>{{citation |first=Jane |last=Pilcher |title=The gender significance of women in power: British women talking about Margaret Thatcher |journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |volume=2 |number=4 |year=1995 |pages=493–508|doi=10.1177/135050689500200405 |s2cid=144965800 }}</ref> 

Thatcher had to share the media spotlight with [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Princess Diana]]. The Queen almost faded into the background between two media stars.<ref name="Pimlott1996">{{citation|last=Pimlott|first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Pimlott|title=The Queen: A Biography of Elizabeth II|edition=1st|year=1996|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-255494-7}}</ref>{{rp| 460–463, 475–479, 484, 509–513}}  Thatcher increasingly assumed regal poses, such as taking the salute at the victory parade after the Falklands war, and becoming the center of attraction on foreign visits. The Queen appeared more as a dowdy housewife.<ref name="Campbell2011">{{citation|last=Campbell|first=John|authorlink=John Campbell (biographer)|title=Margaret Thatcher Volume Two: The Iron Lady|url={{GBurl|id=RfHYhcFWbm4C}}|url-access=limited|edition=reprint|year=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4464-2008-9}}</ref>{{rp|464–467}} Tensions between the two were kept hidden until 1986, when the ''Sunday Times'' reported on the Queen's explicit criticism of Thatcher's policies, especially regarding the people of the Commonwealth, as "uncaring, confrontational and socially divisive." The Prime Minister often ridiculed the Commonwealth, which the Queen held in very high esteem.<ref name="Moore2015">{{citation|last=Moore|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Moore, Baron Moore of Etchingham|title=Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography, Volume Two: Everything She Wants|url={{GBurl|id=LU_ZCQAAQBAJ}}|url-access=limited|year=2015|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-241-20126-8}}</ref>{{rp|575–577, 584}}

===Economic affairs===
[[File:Annual U.K. GDP Growth, 1948 to 2012 (Thatcher) (alt).png|thumb|upright=1.5|Annual UK GDP growth with the economic turnaround under Thatcher highlighted in light green]]
Biographer [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]] reports that in July 1978, before she became prime minister, when asked by a Labour MP in the Commons what she meant by socialism:
{{quote|[Thatcher] was at a loss to reply. What in fact she meant was Government support for inefficient industries, punitive taxation, regulation of the labour market, price controls{{snd}}everything that interfered with the functioning of the free economy.<ref name="Campbell2009">{{citation|last=Campbell|first=John|editor=David Freeman|title=Margaret Thatcher: Grocer's Daughter to Iron Lady|edition=abridged, revised|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-09-954003-8}}</ref>{{rp|95}}}}

====Deflationary strategy====
Under [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government, the taming of [[inflation]] displaced high [[employment]] as the primary policy objective.<ref name="Middleton1996">{{citation|last=Middleton|first=Roger|title=Government Versus the Market: The Growth of the Public Sector, Economic Management, and British Economic Performance C. 1890–1979|edition=illustrated, revised|year=1996|publisher=E. Elgar|isbn=978-1-85898-371-4}}</ref>{{rp|630}}

As a [[monetarism|monetarist]], Thatcher started out in her economic policy by increasing interest rates to slow the growth of the money supply and thus lower inflation. She had a preference for [[indirect tax]]ation over taxes on income, and [[value-added tax]] (VAT) was raised sharply to 15%, with a resultant actual short-term rise in inflation.{{efn| Following the introduction of the 15% VAT rate on 18 June 1979, inflation rose from 11.4% in June to 15.6% in July, reaching a high of 21.9% in May 1980.<ref>{{citation |author=Datablog |year=2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/mar/09/inflation-economics#data |title=UK inflation since 1948 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=15 April 2013}}</ref>}} The fiscal and monetary squeeze, combined with the [[North Sea oil]] effect, appreciated the [[real exchange rate]].{{r|Middleton1996|p=630}} These moves hit businesses—especially the manufacturing sector—and [[unemployment]] exceeded 2 million by the autumn of 1980, up from 1.5 million at the time of Thatcher's [[1979 United Kingdom general election|election]] just over a year earlier.

Political commentators harked back to the [[Heath government]]'s "U-turn" and speculated that Thatcher would follow suit, but she repudiated this approach at the 1980 Conservative Party conference, telling the party: "To those waiting with bated breath for that favourite media catchphrase, the U-turn, I have only one thing to say: You turn if you want to. [[The lady's not for turning]]".<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=104431 |title=Speech to Conservative Party Conference |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=10 October 1980 |access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> That she meant what she said was confirmed in the 1981 budget, when, despite concerns expressed in an open letter from 364 leading economists,<ref>{{cite letter|mode=cs2 |author=[364 economists] |recipient=''[[The Times]]'' |subject=Statement on Economic Policy |date=23 March 1981 |url=https://c59574e9047e61130f13-3f71d0fe2b653c4f00f32175760e96e7.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/FECEBF1EA893413EB9D3FA246218F30A.pdf |accessdate=2020-11-30 |p=2}}</ref> taxes were increased in the middle of a recession, leading to newspaper headlines the following morning of "Howe it Hurts", a reference to the Chancellor [[Geoffrey Howe]].

====Unemployment====
In 1981, as unemployment soared (exceeding 2.5 million by the summer and heading towards 3 million before Christmas) and the Government's popularity plunged, the party chairman, [[Peter Thorneycroft|Lord Thorneycroft]], and two cabinet ministers, [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] and [[Humphrey Atkins]], confronted the Prime Minister and suggested she should resign; according to her adviser, [[Timothy Bell, Baron Bell|Tim Bell]], "Margaret just told them to go away".<ref>{{citation |first=Neil |last=Tweedie |title=Taking on a nation in crisis |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 January 2009 |page=21}}</ref> Thatcher's key ally in the party was [[Home Secretary]], and later [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]], [[William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw|William Whitelaw]]. His [[moral authority]] and support allowed her to resist the internal threat from the [[Edward Heath|Heathite]] [[Wets and dries|wets]].<ref name="Newsinger1992">{{citation |first=John |last=Newsinger |title=True confessions: some Tory memoirs of the Thatcher years |journal=Race and Class |volume=33 |number=4 |date=April–June 1992}}</ref>{{rp|85}}

After the [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton riot]] in West London in April 1981, Employment Secretary [[Norman Tebbit]], responding to a suggestion that rioting was caused by unemployment, observed that the unemployment of the 1930s was far worse than that of the 1980s—and that his father's generation never reacted by rioting. "I grew up in the 1930s with an unemployed father", Tebbit said. "He did not riot. He got on his bike and looked for work, and he went on looking until he found it."<ref>{{citation |first=Peter |last=Burke |title=Disadvantage and Stigma: A Theoretical Framework for Associated Conditions |editor1=Peter Burke |editor2=Jonathan Parker |journal=Social Work and Disadvantage: Addressing the Roots of Stigma Through Association |year=2007 |page=18}}</ref>

Over two million manufacturing jobs were ultimately lost in the recession of 1979–81.{{r|Middleton1996|p=630}} This labour-shedding helped firms deal with long-standing [[X-inefficiency]] from over-manning,{{r|Middleton1996|p=630}} enabling the British economy to catch up to the productivity levels of other advanced capitalist countries.{{r|Middleton1996|p=630}}

The link between the money supply and inflation was proven accurate and by January 1982, the inflation rate had dropped back to 8.6% from earlier highs of 18%.{{r|Middleton1996|p=630}} [[Interest rate]]s were then allowed to fall. Unemployment continued to rise, passing 3 million by January 1982 and remaining this high until early 1987. However, Tebbit later suggested that, due to the high number of people claiming unemployment benefit while working, unemployment never reached three million.

By 1983, manufacturing output had dropped by 30% from 1978, although economic growth had been re-established the previous year. The productivity turnaround from labour-shedding proved to be a one-off, and was not matched by growth in output.{{r|Middleton1996|p=628}} The industrial base was so reduced that thereafter the balance of payments in manufactured goods was in deficit.{{r|Middleton1996|p=630}} Chancellor [[Nigel Lawson]] told the Lords' [[Select Committee on Overseas Trade]]: "There is no adamantine law that says we have to produce as much in the way of manufactures as we consume. If it does turn out that we are relatively more efficient in world terms at providing services than at producing goods, then our national interest lies in a surplus on services and a deficit on goods."<ref>{{citation |first=Stephen |last=Wilks |title=Conservative Governments and the Economy, 1979–97 |journal=Political Studies |volume=45 |number=4 |year=1997 |page=693|doi=10.1111/1467-9248.00105 |s2cid=143151570 }}</ref>

====Defence spending====
In her first six months as Prime Minister, Thatcher repeatedly prioritised defence spending over economic policy and financial control. However, in 1980, she reversed this priority and tried to cut the defence budget.  The 1981 Defence Review by [[John Nott]], the defence minister,  dramatically cut the capabilities of the Royal Navy's surface fleet.  She replaced [[Francis Pym, Baron Pym|Francis Pym]] as Defence Secretary because he wanted more funding.  The cuts were cancelled when the ships destined for cuts proved essential in the Falklands War.<ref>{{citation |first=Edward |last=Hampshire |title=Margaret Thatcher's First U-Turn: Francis Pym and the Control of Defence Spending, 1979–81 |journal=Contemporary British History |volume=29 |pages=359–379 |number=3 |year=2015 |doi=10.1080/13619462.2014.974566 |s2cid=144839832 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=Edward |last=Hampshire |title=Strategic and Budgetary Necessity, or Decision-making 'Along the Grain'?

====Housing and urban enterprise====
{{Further|Housing Act 1980|Right to Buy}}
One of Thatcher's largest and most successful policies assisted council tenants in public housing to purchase their homes at favourable rates. The "Right to Buy" had emerged in the late 1940s, but was too great a challenge to the [[post-war consensus]] to win Conservative endorsement. Thatcher from her earliest days in politics favoured the idea because it would lead to a "property-owning democracy". Some local Conservative-run councils introduced profitable{{clarify|date=April 2017}}{{Fix|text=for whom?}} local sales schemes during the late 1960s. By the 1970s, many working-class people had ample incomes for home ownership, and eagerly accepted Thatcher's invitation to purchase their homes at a sizeable discount. The new owners were more likely to vote Conservative, as Thatcher had hoped.<ref>{{citation |first=Aled |last=Davies |title='Right to Buy': The Development of a Conservative Housing Policy, 1945–1980 |journal=Contemporary British History |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=421–444 |year=2013 |doi=10.1080/13619462.2013.824660 |hdl=1983/fc4cfac3-c403-4252-80cc-f0e6a1de9922 |s2cid=153511890 |url=https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/right-to-buy(fc4cfac3-c403-4252-80cc-f0e6a1de9922).html }}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=Stephen |last=Farrall |display-authors=et al |title=Thatcherite Ideology, Housing Tenure, and Crime: The Socio-Spatial Consequences of the Right to Buy for Domestic Property Crime |date=September 2015|journal=[[British Journal of Criminology]] |volume=56|number=6|DOI= 10.1093/bjc/azv088}}</ref>

To deal with economic stagnation in the inner cities, the Government introduced "enterprise zones" starting in 1981; the idea began in Britain and was adopted by the United States and some EU countries. It targeted designated small, economically depressed neighbourhoods and exempted them from some regulations and taxes. The goal was to attract private capital and new business activity that would bring jobs and progress to declining areas. Important projects included those in [[London Docklands]], Salford and Gateshead.<ref>{{citation |first=Sam |last=Wetherell |title=Freedom Planned: Enterprise Zones and Urban Non-Planning in Post-War Britain |journal=Twentieth Century British History |volume=27 |number=2 |year=2016 |pages=266–289|doi=10.1093/tcbh/hww004 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Thornley1991">{{citation|last=Thornley|first=Andy|title=Urban Planning Under Thatcherism: The Challenge of the Market|edition=illustrated|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-05669-4}}</ref>{{rp|needed=y|date=November 2020}}

===Foreign relations===
====Rhodesia, 1979====

Before the 1979 election Thatcher was on record as supporting the all-white government of [[Ian Smith]] in Rhodesia.,<ref> Campbell (2003), pp. 150–154.</ref><ref>Moore (2013), pp 369–370. 449.</ref>  Under intense world pressure it held elections that included some black voters. One of them, Methodist Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]], became prime minister of "Zimbabwe-Rhodesia" in June 1979 with Smith's support. Thatcher, new to 10 Downing Street, praised the bishop. White Rhodesians expected Britain to recognize the Muzorewa regime and end crippling sanctions. However, Thatcher reversed herself.  She withheld recognition and maneuvered the Muzorewa government into accepting new elections. They had to include [[Joshua Nkomo]] and his [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] as well as [[Robert Mugabe]] and his [[Zimbabwe African National Union]]. These were revolutionary movements that Rhodesian security forces had been trying to suppress for years. Under her direction  Foreign Secretary [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] brokered the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] of December 1979. It resumed British control of Rhodesia; declared a ceasefire; ended guerrilla action; and quickly led to the creation of the [[Republic of Zimbabwe#UDI and civil war (1965–1980)|Republic of Zimbabwe]]. Thus Thatcher's refusal to recognize the Muzorewa government ultimately allowed Mugabe to take power, an outcome that outraged whites in Rhodesia but which satisfied British opinion and was applauded internationally.  Hugo Young states, "She had been instrumental in creating another Third World country."<ref>Hugo Young, ''One of Us: A Biography of Mrs. Thatcher'' (1989) pp 175–183 at 183.</ref><ref>Moore (2013), pp 449–52, 502–503. </ref><ref>Nicholas Waddy. "The Strange Death of 'Zimbabwe-Rhodesia': The Question of British Recognition of the Muzorewa Regime in Rhodesian Public Opinion, 1979."

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2617389 online]</ref>
According to Robert Matthews, the success of the Lancaster House negotiations can be explained by four factors: 
:A balance of forces on the battlefield that clearly favoured the nationalists; international sanctions and their adverse effects on Rhodesia's economy and Salisbury's ability to wage war; a particular pattern of third party interests; and finally, the skill and resources that Lord Carrington as mediator brought to the table.<ref>Robert O.  Matthews, "From Rhodesia to Zimbabwe: prerequisites of a settlement." ''International Journal'' 45.2 (1990): 292-333 at p. 317. </ref>

====Iranian Embassy siege, 1980====
{{Main|Iranian Embassy siege}}
[[File:Zz embassy.jpg|thumb|upright|Thatcher's decisive response to the Iranian siege in London won her widespread praise during a difficult period for the British economy.]]
Thatcher's determination to face down political violence was first demonstrated during the 1980 siege of the Iranian embassy in [[South Kensington|Princes Gate]], London, when for the first time in 70 years the armed forces were authorised to use lethal force on the British mainland. For six days in May, 26 hostages were held by six gunmen; the siege came to a dramatic end with a successful raid by [[Special Air Service|SAS]] commandos. Later that day, Thatcher went to congratulate the SAS men involved and sat among them watching a re-run of the attack.<ref name="Newsinger1998">{{citation |first=John |last=Newsinger |title=Who dares&nbsp;... |journal=History Today |date=1 December 1998 |volume=48 |issue=12}}</ref>{{rp|40}} The breaking of the siege by the SAS was later ranked by the public as one of television's greatest moments.<ref>{{citation |title=100 TV moments – Keep them coming&nbsp;... |newspaper=The Observer |date=11 July 1999}}</ref>

Her decisiveness—christened the "resolute approach" by the Prime Minister herself—became Thatcher's trademark, and a source of her popularity.<ref>{{citation |first=R. W. |last=Apple |title=Toughness Is Reason for Thatcher's High Rating |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1 May 1983}}</ref> In the words of one historian: "The mood reflected Mrs Thatcher's Iron Lady stance, her proclaimed intention of laying the "[[Suez Crisis|Suez Syndrome]]" to rest and again projecting Britain as a great power. Celebration of the SAS was a key component in the popular militarism of the 1980s, fuelled by the continuing "war" against international [[terrorism]] and by the [[Falklands War|Falklands conflict]] and [[Gulf War]]. The storming of the Iranian Embassy had shown that Britain could meet terror with counter-terror: Mrs Thatcher's black-clad "terminators" would protect us".{{r|Newsinger1998|p=40}}

Commenting on the SAS's action, Social Services Secretary [[Norman Fowler, Baron Fowler|Norman Fowler]] agreed: "Mrs Thatcher attracted public support because she seemed to be taking action which the public overwhelmingly thought was right but never thought any government would have the nerve to carry out".{{r|Newsinger1992|pp=88–89}}

====Afghanistan and Poland====
When the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Union troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979]], Thatcher saw it as a typical example of relentless Communist imperialism. However the foreign ministry said the Kremlin was desperately trying to save its failing ally there. Thatcher supported the American plan to boycott the Moscow Olympics, as did Parliament. However the athletes disagreed and they went to Moscow anyway.{{r|Moore2013|pp=560–63}}<ref>{{citation |first=Daniel James |last=Lahey |title=The Thatcher government's response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, 1979–1980 |journal=Cold War History |volume=13 |pages=21–42 |number=1 |year=2013 |doi=10.1080/14682745.2012.721355 |s2cid=153081281 }}</ref>

Thatcher gave the go ahead for Whitehall to approve [[MI6]] (and the SAS) to undertake 'disruptive action' in Afghanistan.{{sfnp|Dorril|2018|p=752}} Supporting the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in [[Operation Cyclone]], they also supplied weapons, training and intelligence to the [[mujaheddin]]. Thatcher visited Pakistan in October 1981 meeting with Pakistan leader General [[Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq]]. She visited some of the many hundreds of thousands of Afghans gathered in refugee camps there giving a speech stating that the 'hearts of the free world were with them'. Five years later two of the Mujaheddin warlords [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] and [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]] met Thatcher in Downing Street.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/secret-affairs-by-mark-curtis-2038691.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Kim | last=Sengupta | title=Secret Affairs, By Mark Curtis | date=2010-07-30}}</ref>

The Polish crisis of 1980 and 1981 involved large-scale anti-Communist protests in the heartland of Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe. Thatcher recognised that Soviet hegemony was vulnerable in Poland and offered public support for [[Lech Wałęsa]] and his [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity labour union]], in close co-operation with the United States and [[Pope John Paul II]] (a long-time leader of Polish Catholicism).

====Falklands War, 1982====
{{Main|Falklands War}}
On 2 April 1982 the ruling Argentine military junta [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invaded the Falkland Islands]], and on 3 April [[Invasion of South Georgia|invaded South Georgia]], British [[Crown Colonies]] that Britain had always ruled but which Argentina had [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|claimed]].<ref name="global">{{citation |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/malvinas.htm|title=Falklands/Malvinas War|access-date=29 October 2008|date=27 April 2007|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org}}</ref> Thatcher had not previously shown concern for the islands, and had proposed large-scale cuts to [[Military of the Falkland Islands|her naval forces]]. Thatcher listened primarily to Admiral [[Henry Leach]], the [[First Sea Lord]]; and to Admiral [[Terence Lewin|Sir Terence Lewin]], the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]]. She immediately decided to expel the invaders.{{r|Moore2013|pp=656–758 (667, 670)}} She replaced foreign minister [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Peter Carrington]] with Francis Pym and rounded up diplomatic support. The [[United Nations Security Council]] denounced Argentina's aggression, and France and other allies provided diplomatic and military support. In the United States, Reagan was supportive, but he also launched diplomatic initiatives to resolve the crisis without a war. In three days Thatcher assembled and sent a [[British naval forces in the Falklands War|naval task force]] to take back control.

In the six weeks it took to arrive, she engaged in diplomatic efforts moderated by US Secretary of State [[Alexander Haig]], but Argentina rejected all compromise proposals. Public opinion, and both major parties, backed Thatcher's aggressive response.<ref>{{citation |first=Peter |last=Riddell |title=The Falklands Crisis: Poll shows backing for Thatcher |newspaper=Financial Times |date=26 April 1982 |page=3}}</ref> The task force sank an [[ARA General Belgrano|Argentine cruiser]], forcing the [[Argentine naval forces in the Falklands War|Argentine Navy]] back to its home harbours.

===Northern Ireland===
In May 1980, one day before Thatcher was due to meet the Irish [[Taoiseach]], [[Charles Haughey]], to discuss [[Northern Ireland]], she announced in Parliament that "the future of the constitutional affairs of Northern Ireland is a matter for the people of Northern Ireland, this government, this parliament, {{em|and no-one else}}".<ref>{{citation |first=Stephen |last=Kelly |title='Love/Hate'—The Haughey/Thatcher Relationship And The Anglo-Irish Summit, 8 December 1980 |journal=History Ireland |volume=23 |issue=1 |year=2015 |pages=46–49}}</ref>{{r|Moore2013|pp=595–603}}

In 1981, a number of [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] prisoners in [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[HM Prison Maze|Maze Prison]] (also known in Northern Ireland as ''Long Kesh'', its previous official name) went on [[1981 Irish hunger strike|hunger strike]] to regain the status of [[political prisoner]]s, which had been revoked five years earlier under the preceding Labour government. [[Bobby Sands]], the first of the strikers, was elected as a Member of Parliament for the constituency of [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] a few weeks before he died of starvation. Thatcher refused to countenance a return to political status for republican prisoners, famously declaring "Crime is crime is crime; it is not political".<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/3/newsid_2451000/2451503.stm |title=1981: IRA Maze hunger strikes at an end |work=On This Day |publisher=BBC News |access-date=17 November 2018|date=3 October 1981 }}</ref> After nine more men had died, most rights were restored to paramilitary prisoners, but official recognition of their political status was not granted.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=5397|title=Maze hunger strike called off|date=3 October 1981|access-date=1 November 2008|publisher=History|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226033054/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=5397|archive-date=26 February 2009}}</ref> Thatcher later asserted: "The outcome was a significant defeat for the IRA."<ref name="Thatcher1993">{{citation |first=Margaret |last=Thatcher |title=The Downing Street Years |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1993}}</ref>{{rp|393}}

Thatcher also continued the "[[Ulsterisation]]" policy of the previous Labour government and its [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], [[Roy Mason]], believing that the [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] of Northern Ireland should be at the forefront in combating [[Irish republicanism]]. This meant relieving the burden on the mainstream [[British Army]] and elevating the role of the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]].

===1983 general election===
{{Main|1983 United Kingdom general election}}
[[File:UK General Election, 1983.svg|thumb|upright|1983 election results]]
The "[[Aftermath of the Falklands War|Falklands Factor]]", along with the resumption of economic growth by the end of 1982, bolstered the Government's popularity and led to Thatcher's victory in the most decisive landslide since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1945]].<ref>{{citation |first=David E. |last=Butler |display-authors=etal |title=The British General Election of 1983 |year=1984}}</ref>

The Labour Party at this time had split, and there was a new challenge in the [[SDP–Liberal Alliance]], formed by an electoral pact between the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. However, this grouping failed to make its intended breakthrough, despite briefly holding an opinion poll lead.<ref>{{citation|title=SDP: Breaking the mould|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1136223.stm|access-date=31 August 2016|work=BBC News|date=25 January 2001}}</ref>

In the June 1983 general election, the Conservatives won 42.4% of the vote, the Labour Party 27.6% and the Alliance 25.4% of the vote. Though the gap between Labour and the Alliance was narrow in terms of votes, the Alliance vote was scattered and they won only a fraction of the seats that Labour held, with its concentrated base. The Conservatives' share of the vote fell slightly (1.5%) since 1979. Labour's vote had fallen by far more (9.3%) and the Conservatives now had an overall majority of 144 MPs.

Thatcher was committed to reducing the power of the [[trade union]]s but, unlike the Heath government, adopted a strategy of incremental change rather than a single Act. Several unions launched [[strike action|strikes]] in response, but these actions eventually collapsed. Gradually, Thatcher's reforms reduced the power and influence of the unions. The changes were chiefly focused upon preventing the recurrence of the large-scale industrial actions of the 1970s, but were also intended to ensure that the consequences for the participants would be severe if any future action was taken. The reforms were also aimed, Thatcher claimed, to democratise the unions, and return power to the members. The most significant measures were to make secondary [[industrial action]] illegal, to force union leadership to first win a ballot of the union membership before calling a strike, and to abolish the [[closed shop]]. Further laws banned workplace ballots and imposed postal ballots.

Coal miners were highly organised and had defeated Prime Minister Heath.  Thatcher expected a major confrontation, planned ahead for one, and avoided trouble before she was ready. In the end the miners' strike of 1984–85 proved a decisive victory for her—one that permanently discouraged trade unionists.<ref>{{citation |first=David |last=Marsh |title=The new politics of British trade unionism: Union power and the Thatcher legacy |year=1992}}</ref>  The [[National Coal Board]] received the largest amount of public subsidies going to any nationalised industry: by 1984 the annual cost to taxpayers of uneconomic pits had reached £1 billion.<ref>{{citation |first=Nigel |last=Lawson |title=The View from No. 11: Memoirs of a Tory Radical |publisher=Bantam Press |year=1992 |pages=143–4, 161}}</ref> The year-long confrontation over strikes carried out from April 1984 by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM), in opposition to proposals to close a large number of unprofitable mines, proved a decisive victory for Thatcher. The Government had made preparations to counter a strike by the NUM long in advance by building up coal stocks, keeping many miners at work, and co-ordinating police action to stop massive picketing. Her policies defeated the NUM strategy of causing severe cuts in the electricity supply—the legacy of the industrial disputes of 1972 would not be repeated.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/03/margaret-thatcher-secret-plan-army-miners-strike|title=Thatcher had secret plan to use army at height of miners' strike |last=Travis |first=Alan |date=3 January 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |issn=0261-3077 |access-date=20 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{citation |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Wilsher |display-editors=etal |title=Strike: Thatcher, Scargill and the miners |publisher=A. Deutsch |year=1985}}</ref>

The images of crowds of militant miners attempting to prevent other miners from working proved a shock even to some supporters of the strikes.  The NUM never held a strike vote, which allowed many miners to keep working and prevented other unions from supporting the strike. The mounting desperation and poverty of the striking families led to divisions within the regional NUM branches, and a breakaway union, the [[Union of Democratic Mineworkers]] (UDM), was soon formed. More and more frustrated miners, resigned to the impending failure of the strike and worn down by months of protests, began to defy the union's rulings, starting splinter groups and advising workers that returning to work was the only viable option.<ref name="Vinen">{{citation |first=Richard |last=Vinen |title=Thatcher's Britain: The Politics and Social Upheaval of the Thatcher Era |year=2010}}</ref>{{rp|ch.{{nbsp}}7}}

The miners' strike lasted a full year before the NUM leadership conceded without a deal. Conservative governments proceeded to close all but 15 of the country's pits, with the remaining 15 being sold off and privatised in 1994. Private companies have since then acquired licences to open new pits and open-cast sites, with the majority of the original mines destroyed and the land redeveloped.

The defeat of the miners' strike led to a long period of demoralisation in the whole of the trade union movement.<ref>{{citation |first=Kenneth O. |last=Morgan |title=Britain Since 1945: The People's Peace |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001 |page=476}}</ref>

The 51-week miners' strike of 1984–85 was followed a year later by the 54-week [[Wapping dispute]] launched by newspaper printers in London.<ref>{{citation |last=Stewart |first=Graham |title=Bang! A History of Britain in the 1980s |year=2013 |pages=360–71}}</ref> It resulted in a second major defeat for unions and another victory for Thatcher's union policies, especially her assurance that the police would defend the plants against pickets trying to shut them down.<ref>Thatcher promised adequate police but otherwise was little involved. See {{harvtxt|Campbell|2003|p=410}} and {{harvtxt|Moore|2016|pp=496–98}}</ref> The target was Britain's largest privately owned newspaper empire, [[News International]] (parent of ''The Times'' and ''News of the World'' and others, all owned by [[Rupert Murdoch]]). He wanted to introduce technological innovations that would put 90% of the old-fashioned typesetters out of work. The company offered redundancy payments of £2,000 to £30,000 to each printer to quit their old jobs. The union rejected the offer and on 24 January 1986 its 6,000 members at Murdoch's papers went on strike. Meanwhile, News International had built and clandestinely equipped a new printing plant in the London district of [[Wapping]]. The principal print unions—the [[National Graphical Association]] (NGA), the [[Society of Graphical and Allied Trades]] (SOGAT 82) and the [[Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers]] (AUEW)—ran closed shops: only union members could be hired at the old Fleet Street plants; most were sons of members. However the new plant in Wapping did not have a closed shop contract. The company activated its new plant with the assistance of another union the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union]] (EETPU). Most journalists (members of the [[National Union of Journalists]]) moved to Wapping and NUJ Chapels continued to operate. However the NUJ urged them not to work there; the "[[refusenik]]s" refused to go to Wapping. Enough printers did come—670 in all—to produce the same number of papers that it took 6,800 men to print at the old shop.  The efficiency was obvious and frightened the union into holding out an entire year. Thousands of union pickets tried to block shipments out of the plant; they injured 574 policemen. There were 1,500 arrests. The pickets failed. The union tried an illegal secondary boycott and was fined in court, losing all its assets which had been used for pensions. In the next two years Britain's national newspapers opened new plants and abandoned Fleet Street, adopting the new technology with far fewer employees. They had even more reason to support Thatcherism.<ref name="Moore2016">{{citation |last=Moore |first=Charles |title=Margaret Thatcher: At Her Zenith |year=2016}}</ref>{{rp|676}}<ref>{{citation |first1=John |last1=Lang |first2=Graham |last2=Dodkins |title=Bad News: The Wapping Dispute |publisher=Spokesman Books |year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=Suellen M. |last=Littleton |title=The Wapping Dispute: An Examination of the Conflict and Its Impact on the National Newspaper Industry |publisher=Avebury |year=1992}}</ref>

====Privatisation====
{{see also2|{{multi-section link|List of privatizations|United Kingdom|1980s 4}}}}
Thatcher's political and economic philosophy emphasised reduced state intervention, [[free market]]s, and [[entrepreneurialism]]. Since gaining power, she had experimented in selling off a small [[nationalised]] company, the National Freight Company, to its workers, with a surprisingly positive response.  One critic on the left dismissed privatisation as "the biggest electoral bribe in history".{{r|Newsinger1992|p=88}} After the 1983 election, the Government became bolder and, starting with [[British Telecom]], sold off most of the large utilities which had been in public ownership since the late 1940s. Many people took advantage of [[stock|share]] offers, although many sold their shares immediately for a quick profit and therefore the proportion of shares held by individuals rather than institutions did not increase. The policy of [[privatisation]], while anathema to many on the left, has become synonymous with Thatcherism and was also followed by [[Tony Blair]]'s government. Wider share-ownership and council house sales became known as "popular" capitalism to its supporters (a description coined by [[John Redwood]]).<ref>{{citation |first=David |last=Marsh |title=Privatization under Mrs. Thatcher: a review of the literature |journal=Public Administration |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=459–480 |year=1991 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9299.1991.tb00915.x }}{{dead link|date=June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=Richard |last=Heffernan |title=UK privatisation revisited: Ideas and policy change, 1979–92 |journal=Political Quarterly |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=264–272 |year=2005 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-923X.2005.00678.x }}</ref>

According to Jacob Ward, the privatization of British Telecom was a "landmark moment for neoliberalism." It became a model for other countries that sold their state utilities.  Planners in the Long Range Planning Department used new computer models to support the transition of telecommunications and more generally the dramatic move from social democracy to neoliberalism, from monopoly to market.  The telecommunications network was essential to plans for the digitalization of the economy. Computer simulations were needed to support neoliberalism, both as a managerial tool that could simulate free markets, as well as a technology that enabled the contraction of the government's role in the private sector.<ref>Jacob Ward, "Computer Models and Thatcherist Futures: From Monopolies to Markets in British Telecommunications" Technology & Culture.

In December 1985 Thatcher was criticised from another former [[Tory]] bastion when the [[Church of England]] report [[Faith in the City]] blamed decay of the [[inner city|inner cities]] on the Government's financial stringency and called for a redistribution of wealth. However the Government had already introduced special employment and training measures,<ref>{{citation |title=Leading Article: Dealing With The Mismatch / Unemployment, the economy and inner-cities |newspaper=Financial Times |date=7 December 1985 |page=8}}</ref> and ministers dismissed the report as "muddle-headed" and uncosted.<ref>{{citation |title=Parliament: Church authors told to take one more step and cost proposals / Inner cities |newspaper=The Times |date=4 December 1985}}</ref><ref name="Petre">{{citation |first=Jonathan |last=Petre |title=The moment of schism for Anglicans and Tories |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=23 May 2006 |page=4}}</ref> The breach with the Church and its liberal bishops remained unhealed until [[William Hague]] called for renewed co-operation in 1998.{{r|Petre}}

Soon after, Thatcher suffered her government's only defeat in the House of Commons, with the failure of the [[Shops Bill 1986]].  The bill, which would have legalised [[Sunday shopping]], was defeated by a [[Christian right]] backbench rebellion, with 72 Conservatives voting against the Government Bill.<ref name="Regan">{{citation |last1=Regan |first1=Paul |year=1988 |title=The 1986 Shops Bill |journal=[[Parliamentary Affairs]] |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=218–235 }}</ref> As well as Thatcher's only defeat, it was the last occasion on which a government bill fell at [[second reading]].<ref>{{citation |title=Guide to Parliament |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6999683.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 October 2007 |access-date=19 March 2011}}</ref> The defeat was immediately overshadowed by the US intervention in Libya.{{r|Regan}}

====Westland affair====
{{Main|Westland affair}}
Thatcher's preference for defence ties with the United States was demonstrated in the Westland affair when, despite ostensibly maintaining a neutral stance, she and Trade and Industry Secretary [[Leon Brittan]] allowed the helicopter manufacturer [[Westland Aircraft|Westland]], a vital defence contractor, to link with the [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation]] of the United States. Defence Secretary [[Michael Heseltine]] had organised a consortium of European and British firms, including the Italian firm [[Agusta]], to make a rival bid. He claimed that Thatcher had prevented proper discussion by cancelling a promised meeting of the Cabinet Economic Affairs Committee early in December 1985. Cabinet eventually (19 December 1985) forbade any minister from actively campaigning for either option.{{r|Moore2016|pp=449–96}}

Thatcher thought Heseltine too powerful and popular a figure to sack. After a period in early January 1986 in which Heseltine and the Thatcher/Brittan camp leaked material damaging to each other's case to the press, Cabinet agreed (9 January) that all statements on the matter, including repetitions of those already made, must be cleared through the Cabinet Office. Heseltine resigned and walked out of the meeting in protest, claiming that Thatcher had broken the conventions of Cabinet government. He remained an influential critic and potential leadership challenger, and would eventually prove instrumental in Thatcher's fall in 1990. Brittan was then forced to resign for having, earlier that month and with the agreement of Thatcher's press adviser [[Bernard Ingham]], ordered the leak of a confidential legal letter critical of Heseltine. For a time Thatcher's survival as Prime Minister seemed in doubt, but her personal involvement in the leak remained unproven and she survived after a poor debating performance in the Commons (27 January) by Opposition Leader [[Neil Kinnock]].{{r|Moore2016|pp=449–96}}

The GLC was the biggest council in [[Europe]]; under the leadership of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] socialist [[Ken Livingstone]] it had doubled its spending in three years, and Thatcher insisted on its abolition as an efficiency measure, transferring most duties to the boroughs, with veto power over major building, engineering and maintenance projects being given to the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|environment secretary]].<ref name="Thomas">{{citation |first=Jo |last=Thomas |title=Thatcher vs. "Red Ken": winner to take London |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2 August 1984}}</ref> The Government also argued that the transfer of power to local councils would increase electoral accountability.<ref name="glc">{{citation |publisher=BBC News |work=On This Day |access-date=30 October 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/31/newsid_2530000/2530803.stm |title=1986: Greater London Council abolished|date=31 March 1986 }}</ref> Critics contended that the "excesses" of a few "[[loony left]]" councils helped Mrs Thatcher to launch a party-political assault',<ref>{{citation |title=To the victor these spoils{{snd}}''The Economist'' reviews Margaret Thatcher's Years as Prime Minister |magazine=The Economist |date=24 November 1990 |page=19}}</ref> as all the eliminated councils were controlled by the Labour Party, favoured higher local government taxes and public spending, and were vocal centres of opposition to her government.

====Economic boom of 1984–1988====
{{Further|Lawson Boom|Big Bang (financial markets)}}
During the 1980s there was a great improvement in the United Kingdom's productivity growth relative to other advanced capitalist countries.{{r|Middleton1996|p=628}} [[Nigel Lawson]], Chancellor of the Exchequer, identified inflation as "the judge and jury of a government's record",{{r|Middleton1996|p=630}} but while the country also improved its [[OECD]] inflation ranking from fifteenth in 1979 to tenth in the [[Lawson Boom]] year of 1987, when inflation had fallen to 4.2%, in the decade as a whole the country still had the second highest inflation rate of the [[G7]] countries.{{r|Middleton1996|p=631}} Unemployment had peaked at nearly 3,300,000 in 1984,<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23627143-recession-watch.do |title=Recession watch |date=23 January 2009|newspaper=Evening Standard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121130938/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23627143-recession-watch.do |archive-date=21 November 2009 }}</ref> but had fallen below 3,000,000 by June 1987,<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393315.stm | work=BBC News | title=1987: Thatcher's third victory | date=5 April 2005 |access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> in early 1989 it fell below 2,000,000 and by December 1989 it stood at just over 1,600,000.<ref>{{citation |url=http://econ.economicshelp.org/2008/10/unemployment-in-uk.html|title=Unemployment in the UK 2012|website=econ.economicshelp.org|access-date=20 September 2016}}</ref>

The United Kingdom's growth rate was more impressive, ranking first in the OECD-16 in 1987, a statistical achievement that Thatcher and her government exploited to the full in the general election campaign of that year.{{r|Middleton1996|p=631}} However, the balance of payments record had deteriorated, faring even worse than those of non-oil-exporting countries, and there was a decline in the country's relative standing in terms of unemployment.{{r|Middleton1996|p=631}} The resulting welfare payments meant that, even though Thatcher and her ministers in 1979 had taken the view that "public expenditure is at the heart of Britain's present economic difficulties", it was not until the boom year of 1987 that the expenditure ratio fell below the 1979 level,{{r|Middleton1996|p=635}} and for most of the 1980s the average tax take was actually higher than in 1979.{{r|Middleton1996|p=636}}

[[File:Rockmore road 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|Anti-Thatcher graffiti in Belfast, 1984]]
On the early morning of 12 October 1984, the day before her 59th birthday, Thatcher escaped injury in the [[Brighton hotel bombing]] during the Conservative Party Conference when the hotel was bombed by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. Five people died in the attack, including Roberta Wakeham, wife of the Government's Chief Whip [[John Wakeham]], and Conservative MP [[Anthony Berry|Sir Anthony Berry]]. A prominent member of the Cabinet, [[Norman Tebbit]], was injured, and his wife Margaret was left paralysed. Thatcher herself escaped assassination by sheer luck.  She insisted that the conference open on time the next day and made her speech as planned in defiance of the bombers, a gesture which won widespread approval across the political spectrum.<ref>{{citation |title=Northern Ireland: The Brighton Bomb [memoirs extract] |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109119 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=12 October 1984 |access-date=9 April 2007}}</ref>{{r|Moore2016|pp=309–16}}

====Anglo-Irish Agreement====
{{Main|Anglo-Irish Agreement}}
On 15 November 1985, Thatcher signed the Hillsborough [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] with Irish Taoiseach [[Garret FitzGerald]], the first time a British government gave the Republic of Ireland a say (albeit advisory) in the governance of Northern Ireland. The agreement was greeted with fury by Northern Irish unionists. The [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionists]] and [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionists]] made an electoral pact and on 23 January 1986, staged an ad hoc referendum by resigning their seats and contesting the subsequent by-elections, losing only one, to the nationalist [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP). However, unlike the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1974, they found they could not bring the agreement down by a general strike. This was another effect of the changed balance of power in [[industrial relations]].

===Foreign affairs===

====Cold War====
{{See also|Cold War (1979–1985)|Cold War (1985–1991)}}
In the [[Cold War]], Thatcher supported US President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s policies of [[rollback]] against the Soviets, which envisioned the end of Communism in Europe (which happened in 1989–91).  This contrasted with the policy of ''[[détente]]'' (or "live and let live") which the West had pursued during the 1970s.    In a decision that came under heavy attack from the Labour Party, American forces were permitted by Thatcher to station nuclear [[cruise missile]]s at British bases, arousing mass protests by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].  A critical factor was Thatcher's idea that [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was the key to the solution. She convinced Reagan that he was "a man we can do business with. " This was a start of a move by the West to force a dismantling of Soviet control over Eastern Europe, which Gorbachev realised was necessary if he was to reform the decrepit Soviet economy.<ref>{{citation |first=Archie |last=Brown |title=The Change to Engagement in Britain's Cold War Policy: The Origins of the Thatcher-Gorbachev Relationship |journal=Journal of Cold War Studies |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=3–47 |year=2008 |doi=10.1162/jcws.2008.10.3.3 |s2cid=57561387 }}</ref> Those who share her views on it credit her with a part in the West's victory, by both the deterrence and ''détente'' postures.  The West won the Cold War "without firing a shot" according to Thatcher, because the Kremlin would not risk confrontation with NATO's superior forces.<ref>{{citation |first=Ed |last=Feulner |title=A new arms race America must win; Booming China is substantially boosting its military spending |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=18 April 2007 |page=47}}</ref>

Thatcher played a major role as a broker between Reagan and Gorbachev in 1985–87, with the successful negotiation of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] (INF). The INF Treaty of December 1987, signed by Reagan and Gorbachev, eliminated all nuclear and conventional missiles, as well as their launchers, with ranges of 500–1,000 kilometres (310–620&nbsp;mi) (short-range) and 1,000–5,500 kilometres (620–3,420&nbsp;mi) (intermediate-range). The treaty did not cover sea-launched missiles of the sort Britain possessed. By May 1991, after on-site investigations by both sides, 2700 missiles had been destroyed.<ref>{{citation |first=Lynn E. |last=Davis |title=Lessons of the INF Treaty |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=720–734 |year=1988 |jstor=20043479|doi=10.2307/20043479 }}</ref>{{r|Moore2016|pp=23–26, 594–5}}<ref>{{citation |author=CQ Press |title=Guide to Congress |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqN2AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA253 |year=2012 |publisher=SAGE |pages=252–53|isbn=9781452235325 }}</ref>

====United States bombing of Libya====
{{Main|1986 United States bombing of Libya}}
[[File:USF-111 Libya1986.JPG|thumb|Thatcher allowed American aircraft to take off from [[RAF Lakenheath]] in April 1986 to participate in an air strike against Libya.]]
In the aftermath of a series of terrorist attacks on US military personnel in Europe, which were believed to have been executed at [[Muammar Gaddafi|Colonel Gaddafi]]'s command, President Reagan decided to carry out a bombing raid on Libya. Both France and Spain refused to allow US aircraft to fly over their territory for the raid. Thatcher herself had earlier expressed opposition to "retaliatory strikes that are against international law" and had not followed the US in an embargo of Libyan oil. However Thatcher felt that as the US had given support to Britain during the Falklands and that America was a major ally against a possible Soviet attack in Western Europe, she felt obliged to allow US aircraft to use bases situated in Britain.<ref name="Campbell2003">{{citation |last=Campbell |first=John |title=The Iron Lady |year=2003 |publisher=Jonathan Cape}}</ref>{{rp|279–80}}

Later that year in America, President Reagan persuaded Congress to approve of an extradition treaty which closed a legal loophole by which IRA members and [[Volunteer (Irish republican)|Volunteers]] escaped extradition by claiming their killings were political acts. This had been previously opposed by Irish-Americans for years but was passed after Reagan used Thatcher's support in the Libyan raid as a reason to pass it.{{r|Campbell2003|p=282}}{{r|Moore2016|pp=513–20}}

====United States invasion of Grenada====
{{Main|Invasion of Grenada}}
Grenada was a former colony and current independent Commonwealth nation under the Queen. The British government exercised no authority there and did not object when [[Maurice Bishop]] took control in a coup in 1979.<ref>{{citation |first=Anthony |last=Payne |title=The Grenada crisis in British politics |journal=The Round Table |volume=73 |issue=292 |pages=403–410 |year=1984 |doi=10.1080/00358538408453664 }}</ref> The small Caribbean island had been ruled by Bishop, a radical Marxist with close ties to Cuba. In October 1983 he was overthrown by dissident Marxists, and killed. This alarmed other small countries in the region who had a regional defence organisation, the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS) which formally asked the United States for help in removing the new regime. Reagan promptly agreed, and almost overnight ordered a major invasion of Grenada. He notified Thatcher a few hours before the invasion, but he did not ask her consent. She was privately highly annoyed, but in cabinet and in Parliament she announced that Britain supported the Americans, saying "We stand by the United States".{{r|Moore2016|pp=117–35, quote page 130}} When it became clear that the American rollback of the upstart Communist regime had been a striking success, Thatcher "came to feel that she had been wrong to oppose it".{{r|Campbell2003|p=279}}

====Apartheid in South Africa====
Thatcher resisted international pressure to impose [[economic sanctions]] on [[South Africa]], where the United Kingdom was the biggest foreign investor and principal trading partner. This meant that the status quo remained, and British companies continued to operate in South Africa, although other European countries continued trading to a lesser degree. According to [[Geoffrey Howe]], one of her closest allies, Thatcher regarded the [[African National Congress|ANC]], which fought to end apartheid, as a "typical terrorist organisation", as late as 1987.<ref name="Ali">{{citation |first=Mohsin |last=Ali |title=Thatcher refuses to budge on sanctions / British Premier reaffirms policy towards South Africa |newspaper=The Times |date=27 July 1985}}</ref>

At the end of March 1984, four South Africans were arrested in Coventry, remanded in custody, and charged with contravening the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 418|UN arms embargo]], which prohibited exports to South Africa of military equipment. Thatcher took a personal interest in the [[Coventry Four]], and [[10 Downing Street]] requested daily summaries of the case from the prosecuting authority, [[HM Customs and Excise]].<ref>{{citation |last1=Norton-Taylor |first1=Richard |author-link=Richard Norton-Taylor |last2=Pallister |first2=David |author-link2=David Pallister |title=Commons test for SA arms row |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 December 1988}}</ref> Within a month, the Coventry Four had been freed from jail and allowed to travel to South Africa, on condition that they return to England for their trial later that year. However, in August 1984, South African foreign minister [[Pik Botha]] decided not to allow the Coventry Four to return to stand trial, forfeiting £200,000 bail money put up by the South African embassy in London.

In April 1984, Thatcher sent senior British diplomat, [[John Leahy (diplomat)|Sir John Leahy]], to negotiate the release of 16 Britons who had been taken hostage by the [[Angola]]n rebel leader, [[Jonas Savimbi]]. At the time, Savimbi's [[UNITA]] guerrilla movement was financed and supported militarily by the [[apartheid]] regime of South Africa. On 26 April 1984 Leahy succeeded in securing the release of the British hostages at the UNITA base in [[Jamba, Cuando Cubango]], Angola.<ref>{{citation|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=AROUND THE WORLD; 17 Are Freed in Angola, 80 Days After Abduction|author=UPI|date=14 May 1984|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

In June 1984, Thatcher received a visit from [[P. W. Botha]], the first South African premier to come to Britain since his nation had left the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961.<ref name="Holman">{{citation |first=Michael |last=Holman |title=S.

Thatcher defended Botha's visit as an encouragement to reform,{{r|Wapo}} but he ignored her concern over Mandela's continued detainment,{{r|FT}} and although a new constitution brought coloured people of mixed race and [[India]]ns into a tricameral assembly, 22 million blacks continued to be excluded from the representation.{{r|Holman}} After the outbreak of violence in September 1984, Thatcher granted temporary sanctuary to six African anti-apartheid leaders in the British consulate in [[Durban]].<ref>{{citation |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 September 1984}}</ref>

In July 1985, Thatcher, citing the support of [[Helen Suzman]], a South African anti-apartheid MP, reaffirmed her belief that economic sanctions against [[Pretoria]] would be immoral because they would make thousands of black workers unemployed; instead she characterised industry as the instrument that was breaking down apartheid.<ref>{{citation |first=Hugo |last=Young |title=Supping with the Devils |publisher=Atlantic |year=2003 |page=6}}</ref>{{r|Ali}} She also believed sanctions would disproportionately injure Britain<ref>{{citation |quote=At the meeting of the Commonwealth heads of government in Nassau, Mrs Margaret Thatcher has maintained her individual stance against economic sanctions against South Africa despite protests from the other Commonwealth leaders |work=Textline Multiple Source Collection |date=21 October 1985}}</ref> and neighbouring African countries,<ref name="Johnson">{{citation |first=Maureen |last=Johnson |title=Thatcher Defends Botha, Opposition Jeers |agency=Associated Press |date=29 October 1985}}</ref> and argued that political and military measures were more effective.<ref name="Ashford">{{citation |first=Nicholas |last=Ashford |title=Thatcher refuses to budge over sanctions / British Premier resists commonwealth pressure over economic embargo against South Africa |newspaper=The Times |date=21 October 1985}}</ref>

Thatcher's opposition to economic sanctions was challenged by visiting anti-apartheid activists, including South African bishop [[Desmond Tutu]], whom she met in London, and [[Oliver Tambo]], exiled leader of the outlawed ANC guerrilla movement,<ref>{{citation |title=New 'hope' after talking to Thatcher, says Tutu |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=4 October 1985 |page=24}}</ref> whose links to the Soviet bloc she viewed with suspicion,<ref>{{citation |first=Nicholas |last=Ashford |title=Why we should talk to Tambo |newspaper=The Times |date=9 September 1985}}</ref> and whom she declined to see because he espoused violence and refused to condemn guerrilla attacks and mob killings of black policemen, local officials and their families.{{r|Johnson}}

At a Commonwealth summit in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in October 1985, Thatcher agreed to impose limited sanctions and to set up a contact group to promote a dialogue with Pretoria,<ref>{{citation |first=Maureen |last=Johnson |title=Commonwealth Reaches Accord On Limited South African Sanctions |agency=Associated Press |date=20 October 1985}}</ref> after she was warned by [[Third World]] leaders, including Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] and Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]], that her opposition threatened to break up the 49-nation Commonwealth.<ref>{{citation |first=Jeff |last=Sallot |title=Unified action sought on apartheid Commonwealth at risk, Thatcher told |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=17 October 1985}}</ref> In return, calls for a total embargo were abandoned, and the existing restrictions adopted by member states against South Africa were lifted.{{r|Ashford}} ANC president Tambo expressed disappointment at this major compromise.<ref>{{citation |first=Richard |last=Evans |title=Tambo scorns Thatcher stand / ANC President criticises British Premier's resistance to sanctions against South Africa |newspaper=The Times |date=26 October 1985}}</ref>

====China and Hong Kong====
{{Further|Sino-British Joint Declaration|Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong}}
[[Hong Kong]] was ceded to the British Empire following the [[First Opium War]] and in 1898 Britain obtained a 99-year lease on the [[New Territories]]. In 1984 Thatcher visited China with a view to resolve the difficulties that would inevitably be encountered as the New Territories were due to be returned to the Chinese in 1997.<ref>{{citation |first=Chi-kwan |last=Mark |title=To 'educate' Deng Xiaoping in capitalism: Thatcher's visit to China and the future of Hong Kong in 1982 |journal=Cold War History |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=161–180 |year=2017 |doi=10.1080/14682745.2015.1094058 |s2cid=155749100 }}</ref>  She signed an agreement with [[Deng Xiaoping]] to hand back not simply the New Territories, but the whole colony, in exchange for China awarding the colony the special status within China of a "Special Administrative Region". Under the terms of the agreement, China was obliged to leave Hong Kong's economic status unchanged after the handover on 1 July 1997, for a period of at least fifty years.<ref>{{citation |first=Robert |last=Cottrell |title=The end of Hong Kong: The secret diplomacy of imperial retreat |publisher=John Murray |year=1993}}</ref>

====European rebate====
{{Main|UK rebate}}
At the Dublin European Council in November 1979, Thatcher argued that the United Kingdom paid far more to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) than it received in spending. She famously declared at the summit: "We are not asking the Community or anyone else for money. We are simply asking to have our own money back". Her arguments were successful and at the June 1984 Fontainbleau Summit, the EEC agreed on an annual rebate for the United Kingdom, amounting to 66% of the difference between Britain's EU contributions and receipts. This still remains in effect, although [[Tony Blair]] later agreed to significantly reduce the size of the rebate. It periodically causes political controversy among the members of the [[European Union]].<ref>{{citation |first=James |last=Spence |title=A high price to pay?

Thatcher, like many Britons, had long been fascinated by the idea of a tunnel under the [[English Channel]] linking to France.{{r|Campbell2003|pp=312–14}} The idea had been tossed around for over a century, but was always vetoed, usually by insularity-minded Englishmen.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Opposition to the tunnel over the decades reflected the high value the British placed on their insularity, and their preference for imperial links that they controlled directly. By the 1960s circumstances had changed radically. The British Empire collapsed and the [[Suez crisis]] made clear that Britain was no longer a superpower, and had to depend on its military allies on the continent.<ref>{{citation |first=Duncan |last=Redford |title=Opposition to the Channel Tunnel, 1882–1975: Identity, Island Status and Security |journal=History |volume=99 |issue=334 |pages=100–120 |year=2014 |doi=10.1111/1468-229x.12046}}</ref>  The Conservatives could more carefully consider the long-term economic value to business and strategic value, and also the new sense of a European identity. Labour was worried that a tunnel would bring new workers and lower wage rates. Britain's prestige, security and wealth now seemed safest when tied closely to the continent.<ref>{{citation |first=Richard S. |last=Grayson |title=The British Government, the Channel Tunnel and European Unity, 1948–64 |journal=European History Quarterly |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=415–436 |year=1996 |doi=10.1177/026569149602600304 |s2cid=144255457 }}</ref>

Thatcher and Mitterrand agreed on the project and set up study groups. Mitterrand as a socialist said the French government would pay its share.  Thatcher insisted on private financing for the British share, and the City assured her that private enterprise was eager to fund it.  Final decisions were announced in January 1986.<ref>{{citation |first=Ian |last=Holliday |title=The politics of the Channel Tunnel |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |volume=45 |issue=2 |year=1992 |pages=188–204}}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=Christophe |last=Dupont |title=The Channel Tunnel Negotiations, 1984–1986: Some aspects of the process and its outcome |journal=Negotiation Journal |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=71–80 |year=1990 |doi=10.1111/j.1571-9979.1990.tb00555.x}}</ref>

===Domestic policies===

====Economics and welfare reforms====
In 1988, Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Nigel Lawson]] reacted to a market fall with a reflationary budget, stoking inflation and precipitating a slide in the Government's fortunes. By the time of Thatcher's resignation in 1990, inflation had again hit 10%, the same level she had found it in 1979.

Overall, the economic record of Thatcher's government is disputed. In relative terms, it could be held there was a modest revival of British fortunes. Real [[gross domestic product]] had grown by 26.8% over 1979–89 in the United Kingdom as against 24.3% for the [[European Community|EC]]-12 average.{{r|Middleton1996|p=627}} Measured by [[total factor productivity]], labour, and capital, British productivity growth between 1979 and 1993 compared favourably with the OECD average.{{r|Middleton1996|p=628}}

However under Thatcherite management the macro-economy was unstable, even by the standards of the [[Keynesian]] era of stop-go. The amplitude of fluctuations in [[gross domestic product]] and real gross private non-residential fixed capital formation was greater in the United Kingdom than for the OECD.{{r|Middleton1996|pp=631–34}}

In the Thatcher years the top 10% of earners received almost 50% of the tax remissions,{{r|Middleton1996|p=636}} but there proved to be no simple trade-off between equality and efficiency.{{r|Middleton1996|p=636}} The receipts ratio{{clarify|date=August 2015}} did not fall below the 1979 level until 1992.{{r|Middleton1996|p=636}} The expenditure ratio rose again after Thatcher's resignation in 1990, even climbing for a time above the 1979 figure.{{r|Middleton1996|pp=635–36}} The cause was the heavy budget charge of the recessions of 1979–81 and 1990–92 and the extra funding required to meet the higher level of unemployment.{{r|Middleton1996|p=636}}

Welfare reforms in Thatcher's third term created an adult Employment Training system that included full-time work done for the dole plus a £10 top-up, on the [[workfare]] model from the [[United States]].

====Section 28====
{{Main|Section 28}}
Though an early backer of [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|decriminalisation of male homosexuality]], at the 1987 Conservative Party conference Thatcher's speech read: "Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be [[gay]]". Backbench Conservative MPs and peers had already begun a backlash against the "promotion" of homosexuality and, in December 1987, the controversial "[[Section 28]]" was added as an amendment to what became the [[Local Government Act 1988]].<ref>{{citation |first=Philip A. |last=Thomas |title=The nuclear family, ideology and AIDS in the Thatcher years |journal=Feminist Legal Studies |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=23–44 |year=1993 |doi=10.1007/BF01191523 |s2cid=144107361 }}</ref> This legislation was eventually repealed by [[Tony Blair]]'s government between 2000 and [[Local Government Act 2003|2003]].

At [[Bruges, Belgium]], in 1988, Thatcher made a speech in which she outlined her opposition to proposals from the [[European Union|European Community]] for a federal structure and increasing centralisation of decision-making. Although she had supported British membership, Thatcher believed that the role of the EC should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that new EC regulations would reverse the changes she was making in the UK, stating that she had "not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain" only to see her reforms undermined by "a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels".<ref>{{citation |title=Speech to the College of Europe |date=20 September 1988 |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=107332 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |access-date=16 April 2017}}</ref> She was specifically against [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]], through which [[euro|a single currency would replace national currencies]], and for which the EC was making preparations.{{efn|Thatcher's successor [[John Major]] would eventually secure a British opt-out from the euro at the [[Maastricht Treaty]] negotiated at the end of 1991 and Britain has so far remained outside the [[eurozone]].

In 1987–88 Chancellor [[Nigel Lawson]] had been following a policy of "shadowing the deutschmark", i.e. cutting interest rates and selling pounds to try to prevent the pound rising above DM 3.00 (as a substitute for joining the European [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] which Thatcher had vetoed in 1985); in an interview for the ''Financial Times'', in November 1987, Thatcher claimed not to have been told of this and did not approve.<ref>{{citation |date=20 November 1987 |title=Interview for Financial Times |url=https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/106969 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |access-date=9 April 2007}}</ref> By 1989 the economy was suffering from high interest rates (they peaked at 15% in autumn 1989) imposed to temper a potentially [[Boom and bust|unsustainable boom]], which she believed had been exacerbated by Lawson's policies. Thatcher's popularity once again declined.

At a meeting before the European Community summit in Madrid in June 1989, Lawson and Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe forced Thatcher to agree to the circumstances under which she would join the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. At the meeting, they both threatened they would resign if their demands were not met.{{r|Thatcher1993|p=712}} Thatcher responded by moving Howe to [[Leader of the House of Commons]] (despite giving him the title Deputy Prime Minister he was now effectively removed from decision-making over Europe) and by listening more to her adviser [[Alan Walters|Sir Alan Walters]] on economic matters. Lawson resigned that October, feeling that Thatcher had undermined him.

====South Africa and release of Mandela====
Thatcher continued to be the leading international advocate of a policy of contact with apartheid [[South Africa]],<ref name="Dowden, 1990 p. 13">{{citation |first=Richard |last=Dowden |title=Prime Minister claims her South African policies have been vindicated |newspaper=The Independent |date=3 February 1990 |page=13}}</ref> and the most forthright opponent of economic sanctions against the country, which was ruled by a white minority government.<ref name="Peter Gregson 1990">{{citation |first=Peter |last=Gregson |title=Thatcher isolated on S.

Rejecting the US policy of disinvestment as a mistake, she argued a prosperous society would be more receptive to change.{{r|Dowden, 1990 p. 13}}

In October 1988, Thatcher said she would be unlikely to visit South Africa unless black nationalist leader [[Nelson Mandela]] was released from prison,<ref>{{citation |first1=David |last1=Hughes |first2=Peter |last2=Godwin |title=Thatcher hint on Mandela |newspaper=Sunday Times |date=2 October 1988}}</ref> and in March 1989 she stressed the need to release him in order for multi-party talks to take place,<ref>{{citation |title=Mandela release supported by Prime Minister |newspaper=Financial Times |date=17 March 1989 |page=14}}</ref> urging that the [[African National Congress]]'s promise to suspend violence should be enough to permit his release, and that the "renunciation of violence" should not be an absolute condition for negotiations for a settlement.<ref>{{citation |title=Thatcher says renunciation of violence by ANC no longer an absolute condition for negotiations |newspaper=The Guardian |date=25 March 1989}}</ref> At the end of March 1989, Thatcher's six-day, 10,000-mile tour through [[southern Africa]]—a follow-up to her "look and learn" exercise in [[Kenya]] and [[Nigeria]] in 1988—did not include South Africa because Mandela had not yet been released.<ref>{{citation |first=Robin |last=Oakley |title=Thatcher pursues role as peace broker; Tour of African nations |newspaper=The Times |date=27 March 1989}}</ref>

[[File:South Africa House anti apartheid London 1989.jpg|thumb|An [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] protest at [[High Commission of South Africa, London|South Africa House]] in London, 1989]]
Thatcher met reformist [[F. W. de Klerk]] in London in June 1989 and stressed that Mandela must be freed and reforms put in place before she would visit the country.<ref>{{citation |first=Giles |last=Elgood |title=Thatcher tells de Klerk to free Nelson Mandela |agency=Reuters |date=23 June 1989}}</ref> In July 1989 she called for the release not only of Mandela, but also [[Walter Sisulu]] and Oscar Mpetha, before all-group talks could continue.<ref>{{citation |title=Prime Minister Attaches New Conditions to South Africa Talks |newspaper=The Times |date=5 July 1989 |page=10}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Thatcher in talks with South African Campaigners |agency=Reuters News |date=12 July 1989}}</ref>

Thatcher, therefore, welcomed de Klerk's decision in February 1990 to release Mandela and lift the ban on the ANC, and said the change vindicated her positive policy: "We believe in carrots as well as sticks".{{r|Dowden, 1990 p. 13}}<ref>{{citation |first=Andrew |last=McEwen |title=British policy over South Africa proved right, says Thatcher |newspaper=The Times |date=3 February 1990}}</ref>{{r|Peter Gregson 1990}} However Thatcher had also set the freeing of Mandela as a condition of friendship with the white government.<ref>{{citation |first=Richard |last=Dowden |title=Who gets the credit for Mandela's release? |newspaper=The Independent |date=12 February 1990 |page=6}}</ref>

Thatcher said the European Community's voluntary ban on new investment should be lifted when Mandela was released.<ref>{{citation |first=John |last=Mason |title=British Premier Thatcher calls for lifting of minor sanctions against South Africa |newspaper=Financial Times |date=7 February 1990 |page=20}}</ref> However her call to the world to reward reforms was countered by Mandela himself, who while still in jail argued sanctions must be maintained until the end of white rule,{{r|Peter Gregson 1990}} and criticised her decision to lift a ban on new investment unilaterally.<ref>{{citation |title=Mandela says British sanctions decision wrong |agency=Reuters |date=23 February 1990}}</ref> Mandela declared: "We regard the attitude of the British Government on the question of sanctions as of primary importance&nbsp;...

The NATO nations or in general agreement on delicately handling the collapse of communism in [[Eastern Europe]] in 1989, the reunification of Germany in 1990–91, and the end of communism and the Soviet Union in 1991. There was no gloating or effort to humiliate Gorbachev. While US President [[George H. W. Bush]] wanted to make NATO more of a political than a military alliance, Thatcher, spoke out for the importance of the military role. Like [[François Mitterrand|Mitterrand]] in France, she was nervous about the [[reunification of Germany]], repeating the quip from [[Lord Ismay]], NATO's first secretary general: "The purpose of NATO is to keep the Americans in, the Russians out, and the Germans down."<ref>{{citation |first=Jon |last=Meacham |title=Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush |year=2015 |page=407, quote on 401}}</ref>  Thatcher and Mitterrand had a more specific worry. Bush said: "Margaret still feared the worst from reunification and, like Mitterrand, worried that the Germans might "go neutral" and refuse to permit stationing nuclear weapons on their soil." That is, Chancellor Kohl might trade neutralisation of united Germany as part of the price the Kremlin wanted to approve unification.  In the event, Germany was reunited and there was no neutralisation.<ref>{{citation |first1=Ryan J. |last1=Barilleaux |first2=Mark J. |last2=Rozell |chapter=Bush and Thatcher: Managing the End of the Cold War |editor-first=Stanislao |editor-last=Pugliese |title=The Political Legacy of Margaret Thatcher |year=2004 |page=152}}</ref>

Thatcher pushed President Bush to take strong military action in reversing Iraq's [[invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990, to which she sent over 45,000 troops. In the following year, they saw combat under her successor [[John Major]] in [[Operation Granby]].{{r|Campbell2003|pp=670–71}}

===Decline and fall===

====1989 leadership challenge====
{{Main|1989 Conservative Party leadership election}}
In November 1989 Thatcher was challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by [[Sir Anthony Meyer, 3rd Baronet|Sir Anthony Meyer]]. As Meyer was a virtually unknown backbench MP, he was viewed as a "[[stalking horse]]" candidate for more prominent members of the party. Thatcher easily defeated Meyer's challenge, but there were sixty ballot papers either cast for Meyer or abstaining, a surprisingly large number for a sitting Prime Minister. Her supporters in the Party, however, viewed the results as a success, claiming that after ten years as Prime Minister and with approximately 370 Conservative MPs voting, the opposition was surprisingly small.<ref>{{citation |publisher=BBC News |work=On This Day |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/5/newsid_2528000/2528339.stm |title=Thatcher beats off leadership rival |access-date=9 April 2007|date=5 December 1989 }}</ref>

Thatcher was fiercely committed to a new tax—commonly called the "poll tax"—that would apply in equal amounts to rich and poor alike, despite intense public opposition.  Her inability to compromise undermined her leadership in the Conservative Party, which turned decisively against her.  Thatcher sought to relieve what she considered the unfair burden of [[property tax]] on the property owning section of the population, and outlined a fundamental solution as her flagship policy in the Conservative manifesto for the 1987 election. Local government [[Rates (tax)|rates]] (taxes) were replaced by the community charge, popularly known as the "poll tax", which levied a flat rate on all adult residents.<ref name="Smith">{{citation |first=Peter |last=Smith |title=Failure in British Government: The Politics of the Poll Tax |journal=National Tax Journal |volume=48 |number=2 |date=June 1995}}</ref>{{rp|297}} Almost every adult, irrespective of income or wealth, paid the same, which would heavily redistribute the tax burden onto the less well-off.<ref>{{citation |first1=Michael |last1=Crick |first2=Adrian |last2=Van Klaveren |title=Mrs Thatcher's greatest blunder |journal=Contemporary British History |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=397–416 |year=1991 |postscript=; the poll tax |doi=10.1080/13619469108581185}}</ref>

She defended the poll tax, firstly, on the principle of marginality, that all voters should bear the burden of extra spending by local councils, and, secondly, on the benefit principle, that burdens should be proportional to benefits received.{{r|Smith|p=298}} Ministers disregarded political research which showed potential massive losses for marginal Conservative-voting households.<ref name="Travers">{{citation |first=Tony |last=Travers |title=The Politics and Economics of the Poll Tax: Mrs Thatcher's Downfall |journal=Public Administration |volume=69 |number=4 |date=Winter 1991 |page=539}}</ref>

The poll tax was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales in 1990. This highly visible redistribution of the tax burden onto the less well-off proved to be one of the most contentious policies of Thatcher's premiership. Additional problems emerged when many of the tax rates set by local councils proved to be much higher than earlier predicted. Opponents organised to resist bailiffs and disrupt court hearings of community charge debtors. One Labour MP, [[Terry Fields]], was jailed for 60 days for refusing to pay.

Constitutional commentators concluded from the tax fiasco that "the British state [became] dangerously centralised, to an extent that important policy developments can now no longer be properly debated".{{r|Smith|p=299}} The unpopularity of the poll tax came to be seen as an important factor in Thatcher's downfall,<ref name="Gibson">{{citation |first=J.

Following Thatcher's departure, her former chancellor [[Nigel Lawson]] labelled the poll tax as "the one great blunder of the Thatcher years". The succeeding [[First Major ministry|Major government]] announced the abolition of the tax in spring 1991 and in 1993 replaced it with [[Council Tax]], a banded property tax similar in many respects to the older system of rates.{{r|Gibson}} Former Trade and Industry Secretary [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]] agreed that Thatcher had suffered a massive defeat over the poll tax, but he argued that Major's repeal "vindicated the rioters and those who had refused to pay.

Thatcher's political "assassination" was, according to witnesses such as [[Alan Clark]], one of the most dramatic episodes in British political history.{{r|Vinen|pp=249–73|Campbell2003|pp2=709–47, 410}} The idea of a long-serving Prime Minister—undefeated at the polls—being ousted by an internal party ballot might at first sight seem bizarre. However, by 1990, opposition to Thatcher's policies on local government taxation, her Government's perceived mishandling of the economy (in particular the high interest rates of 15% that eroded her support among home owners and business people), and the divisions opening in the Conservative Party over [[European integration]] made her seem increasingly politically vulnerable and her party increasingly divided. A Gallup poll in October 1990 showed that while Thatcher remained personally respected there was overwhelming opposition towards her final initiatives—83% disapproved of the Government's management of the [[National Health Service]], 83% were against [[water privatisation]], and 64% were against the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]], while various polls suggested the party was trailing Labour by between 6 and 11 points.  Moreover, the Prime Minister's distaste for "consensus politics" and willingness to override colleagues' opinions, including that of her Cabinet, emboldened the backlash against her when it did occur.<ref>{{citation |first=Christopher |last=Foster |title=British Government in Crisis |location=London |publisher=Hart |year=2005}}</ref>

On 1 November 1990, [[Geoffrey Howe|Sir Geoffrey Howe]], one of Thatcher's oldest allies and longest-serving Cabinet member, resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister in protest at Thatcher's open hostility both to moves towards European federalism and to her own government's policy advocating a "hard ecu", i.e. a new European currency which competed alongside existing national currencies. In his resignation speech in the House of Commons two weeks later, he likened having to negotiate against what he called the "background noise" of her rhetoric to trying to play cricket despite the team captain having broken her own team's bats. He ended by suggesting that the time had come for "others to consider their own response to the tragic conflict of loyalties" with which he stated that he had wrestled "for perhaps too long".

Thatcher's former cabinet colleague [[Michael Heseltine]] then challenged her for the leadership of the party; she led the first round of voting by Conservative MPs (20 November) with just under 55% of the vote, but fell four votes short of the 15% margin needed to win outright. Though she initially stated that she intended to contest the second ballot, most of Thatcher's Cabinet colleagues offered her at best lukewarm support and many warned her that she would very likely lose a second ballot to Heseltine. On 22 November, at just after 9.30&nbsp;am, she announced to the Cabinet that she would not be a candidate in the second ballot after all. Shortly afterwards, her staff made public what was, in effect, her resignation statement, in which she stated that she had "concluded that the unity of the Party and the prospects of victory in a General Election would be better served" if she stood down as Prime Minister.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = "One certain beneficiary of Mrs Thatcher's radicalism has been the Labour party. She hoped to kill it, and, by 1983, it indeed seemed close to death. Instead, fear chastened it into accepting the disciplines of its new leader, Mr Neil Kinnock. True, Labour's 1983 humiliation owed much to the defection of right-wingers to form the Social Democratic party; but, in a sense, that too was her doing. Now, after years of gloomily watching her reverse the socialist 'ratchet', the Labour party has transformed itself. It has ditched unilateralism, hostility to the European Community and zeal for nationalisation. Labour as socialism is dead; as a political machine it is alive and well – and justifiably optimistic."

[[Neil Kinnock]], Leader of the Opposition, proposed a motion of no confidence in the Government, and [[Margaret Thatcher]] seized the opportunity this presented on the day of her resignation to deliver one of her most memorable performances. Among other quips, she famously noted: "a single currency is about the politics of Europe, it is about a federal Europe by the back door. So I shall consider the proposal of [[Dennis Skinner|the Honourable Member for Bolsover]] [that she be the first governor of the new European Central Bank]. Now where were we? I am enjoying this".

She supported [[John Major]] as her successor and, after he had won the leadership contest, she formally resigned as Prime Minister on 28 November. In the years to come her approval of Major would fall away. After her resignation a [[MORI]] poll found that 52% agreed with the proposition that "On balance she had been good for the country", while 48% disagreed thinking she had been bad.<ref>{{citation |first=Dennis |last=Kavagnah |title=The Reordering of British Politics: Politics after Thatcher |journal=1997 |page=134}}</ref> In 1991, she was given a long and unprecedented standing ovation at the party's annual conference, although she politely rejected calls from delegates for her to make a speech. She "all but shunned" the House of Commons after losing power, and gave no clue as to her future plans.<ref>{{citation |first=Jim |last=Wolf |title=Thatcher Warns of "Dark Forces" on Rise in Soviet Union |agency=Reuters |date=8 March 1991}}</ref>  She retired from the House at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], at the age of 66 years.

====Record in perspective====
Altogether, the eleven-year duration of her three terms in office make up the third to have outlasted a decade from start to finish, following [[Robert Walpole]] in the 1730s and [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] in the 1790s. Despite her electoral success in accumulating tens of millions of votes throughout Great Britain, only in [[Southern England]] and [[the Midlands]] did she ever win a majority of the popular vote.<ref>{{citation|author=Eric J.

==Foreign policy overview==
[[File:President Ronald Reagan talking on the telephone with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of the United Kingdom in the Oval Office.jpg|thumb|[[President Reagan]] talking on the telephone with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the Oval Office, 1987]]

Thatcher had broadened her interest in foreign policy when she became party leader, and would work with five foreign secretaries—[[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Peter Carington]] (1979–82), [[Francis Pym]] (1982–83), [[Geoffrey Howe]] (1983–89), [[John Major]] (1989) and finally [[Douglas Hurd]] (1989–90). As Prime Minister, she cautiously moved closer to the European Community and tried to slow world condemnation of South Africa.{{non sequitur|date=April 2019}} She agreed to return Hong Kong to China. Having long denounced Soviet Communism, she escalated her attacks when it invaded Afghanistan.{{r|Sharp}}{{page needed|date=April 2019}} However, she would seek [[détente]] with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and later welcomed the collapse of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe in 1989.{{r|Sharp}}{{page needed|date=April 2019}} She went to [[Falklands War|war against Argentina]] to recover the Falkland Islands and was a leader in the coalition opposing the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq. She developed a productive and active relationship with US President Ronald Reagan.<ref name="Sharp">{{citation |first=Paul |last=Sharp |title=Thatcher's Diplomacy: The Revival of British Foreign Policy |year=1999}}</ref>

===From the National Archives===
Since the [[Death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher|death of Margaret Thatcher in 2013]], several government documents relating to her premiership have been declassified and released by the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]. These include:

====GCSEs====
Papers released in December 2014 show that Thatcher completely disapproved of [[GCSE]]s which, in 1986, Sir [[Keith Joseph]] was trying to introduce in the face of fierce opposition from teaching unions.  At very least she wanted a 2-year delay to ensure rigorous syllabuses and adequate teacher training.  However, when the unions who had been involved in a pay dispute for 2 years further criticised reforms at their conference, Joseph persuaded her to go ahead immediately to avoid appearing to take their side. According to Dominic Cummings, special advisor to [[Michael Gove]], it was a catastrophic decision which led to a collapse in the integrity of the exam system.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4309304.ece|title=Thatcher introduced GCSEs to spite the teaching unions|newspaper=The Times|first=David |last=Sanderson|date= 30 December 2014|access-date=30 January 2015}}</ref>

====Cocaine production====
In July 1989 Thatcher called for research on the use of [[biological weapon]]s against [[cocaine]] producers in Peru, in the context of the feared [[crack cocaine]] epidemic among black British people. Carolyn Sinclair, a policy adviser, suggested that Thatcher proceed cautiously in working with black communities because she believed they gave [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to babies.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/margaret-thatcher-letters-cocaine-spray-plant-killing-pests-production-war-on-drugs-prime-minister-a7500121.html|title=Margaret Thatcher's letters reveal plan to spray cocaine plants with deadly pests|last=Wardle|first=Sally|date=30 December 2016|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=30 December 2016}}</ref>

===From inquiries===
In 2020 the [[Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse]] reported that Margaret Thatcher was aware of child abuse allegations against [[Chester (UK Parliament constituency)|Chester]] MP [[Peter Morrison]].<ref>[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/abuse-inquiry-mp-peter-morrison-backed-by-thatcher-despite-claims-against-him-3jbnw9095 Abuse inquiry: MP Peter Morrison backed by Thatcher despite claims against him] The Times</ref>
