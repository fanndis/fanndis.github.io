{{Islamic female dress}}
The '''abaya''' "cloak" ([[varieties of Arabic|colloquially]] and more commonly, {{lang-ar|عباية}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿabāyah}}'', especially in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|عباءة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿabā'ah}}''; plural {{lang|ar|عبايات}} ''{{transl|ar|ʿabāyāt}}'', {{lang|ar|عباءات}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿabā'āt}}''), sometimes also called an ''aba'', is a simple, loose over-[[garment]], essentially a [[robe]]-like dress, worn by some women in parts of the [[Muslim world]] including [[North Africa|North East Africa]], Somalia, Morocco, and the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Yarwood|first=Doreen|author-link=Doreen Yarwood|title=The Encyclopedia of World Costume|year=1978|publisher=Bonanza Books|location=New York|isbn=0-517-61943-1|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktDfAAAAMAAJ&q=the+encyclopedia+of+world+costume&dq=the+encyclopedia+of+world+costume&hl=en&ei=_1BkTpjSAqTOiAKToKynCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA}}</ref> 
Traditional ''abayat'' are black and may be either a large square of fabric draped from the shoulders or head or a long [[kaftan]]. The ''abaya'' covers the whole body except the head, feet, and hands. It can be worn with the ''[[niqāb]]'', a face veil covering all but the eyes. Some women also wear long black gloves, so their hands are covered as well. It is common that the abayat is worn to special occasions, such as Mosque visits and Islamic Holiday celebrations for Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.

The [[Women in Indonesia|Indonesian]] traditional dress [[kebaya]] gets its name from the ''abaya''.

==Rationale==
{{Arab culture}}
The rationale for the ''abaya'' is often attributed to the Quranic quote, "O Prophet, tell your wives and daughters, and the believing women, to cover themselves with a loose garment. They will thus be recognised and no harm will come to them" ([[Female figures in the Quran#Daughters of Muhammad|Qur'an 33:59]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/033.qmt.html#033.059 |title=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement |publisher=Usc.edu |accessdate=2012-08-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823114001/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/033.qmt.html |archivedate=2011-08-23 }}</ref> translated by [[Ahmad Ali (writer)|Ahmed Ali]]). This quotation is often given as the argument for wearing the ''abaya''.

The ''abaya'' is most common in countries with large Muslim populations. Some denominations of Islam consider the entire female body, except for the face and hands, [[awrah]] – that which should be concealed in public from males unrelated by blood or marriage.

==Countries==
Outside some Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, the abaya is not widely worn by Muslim women. It is rare in countries like [[Indonesia]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. Abaya also refers to different garments in different countries. In [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], they tend to be black in color.

===Saudi Arabia===
In [[Saudi Arabia]], women are required to cover in public.<ref>Sanders, Eli.

==Styles==
''Abayat'' are known by various names but serve the same purpose, which is to cover. Contemporary models are usually [[caftan]]s, cut from light, flowing fabrics like [[crepe (textile)|crepe]], [[Georgette (fabric)|georgette]], and [[Chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]]. Other known styles are front open and front closed abaya. Styles differ from region to region: some ''abayat'' have embroidery on black fabric while others are brightly coloured and have different forms of artwork across them.
