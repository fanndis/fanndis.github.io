Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Traditionally, since the 19th century, [[First-wave feminism|first-wave]] [[liberal feminism]] that sought political and legal equality through [[political reform|reforms]] within a [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] framework was contrasted with [[Labour movement|labor]]-based [[proletarian]] women's movements that over time developed into [[socialist feminism|socialist]] and [[Marxist feminism]] based on [[class struggle]] theory.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Artwińska |first1=Anna |title=Gender, Generations, and Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and Beyond |date=2020 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref> Since the 1960s both of these traditions are also contrasted with [[radical feminism]] that arose from the [[radical politics|radical]] wing of [[second-wave feminism]] and that calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate [[androcentrism|male supremacy]]; together liberal, socialist and radical feminism are sometimes called the "Big Three" schools of feminist thought.<ref name="Maynard" /> Since the late 20th century many newer forms of feminisms have emerged. Some forms of feminism have been criticized for taking into account only [[White feminism|white]], middle class, college-educated, [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]], or [[TERF|cisgender]] perspectives. These criticisms have led to the creation of ethnically specific or [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] forms of feminism, such as [[black feminism]] and [[Intersectionality|intersectional feminism]].<ref name=Weedon/>

=== 19th and early-20th centuries ===
{{Main|First-wave feminism}}
First-wave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th and early-20th centuries. In the UK and US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. New legislation included the [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]] in the UK, which introduced the [[tender years doctrine]] for child custody and gave women the right of custody of their children for the first time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wroath|first=John|title=Until They Are Seven, The Origins of Women's Legal Rights|year=1998|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=1-872-870-57-0|url=https://archive.org/details/untiltheyareseve00wroa}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=L.

[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] passed legislation in 1884 and [[New South Wales]] in 1889; the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. With the turn of the 19th century, activism focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's [[suffrage]], though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's [[Sexual and reproductive health and rights|sexual]], [[reproductive rights|reproductive]], and [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]] too.<ref name=NoTurningBack464>{{cite book|author=Freedman, Estelle B. |title=No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and the Future of Women |year=2003 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-45053-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/noturningbackhis00free/page/464 464] |url=https://archive.org/details/noturningbackhis00free/page/464 }}</ref>

[[Women's suffrage]] (the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office) began in Britain's [[Australasia]]n colonies at the close of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of [[Feminism in New Zealand|New Zealand]] granting women the right to vote in 1893; South Australia followed suit in 1895.

The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of 1944 proposed on 24 March 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by [[Fernand Grenier]], they were given full citizenship, including the right to vote. Grenier's proposition was adopted 51 to 16. In May 1947, following the [[November 1946 French legislative election|November 1946 elections]], the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the "[[gender differences|gender gap]]", stating in ''[[Le Populaire]]'' that women had not voted in a consistent way, dividing themselves, as men, according to social classes. During the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] period, feminism waned in importance. Wars (both World War I and World War II) had seen the provisional emancipation of some women, but post-war periods signalled the return to conservative roles.<ref name=Bard>{{cite journal |first=Christine |last=Bard |url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/index.php?numero=01&rub=dossier&item=7 |title=Les premières femmes au Gouvernement (France, 1936–1981) |trans-title=First Women in Government (France, 1936–1981) |journal=[[Histoire@Politique]] |issue=1 |date=May–June 2007 |volume=1 |page=2 |doi=10.3917/hp.001.0002 |language=fr}}</ref>

Feminists continued to campaign for the reform of [[family law]]s which gave husbands control over their wives. Although by the 20th century [[coverture]] had been abolished in the UK and US, in many [[continental European]] countries married women still had very few rights. For instance, in France, married women did not receive the right to work without their husband's permission until 1965.<ref name=Guillaumin>{{cite book |last=Guillaumin|first=Colette|year=1994 |title=Racism, Sexism, Power, and Ideology |pages=193–95}}</ref><ref name=Meltzer>{{cite book |last=Meltzer |first=Françoise |year=1995 |title=Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality |page=88}}</ref> Feminists have also worked to abolish the [[marital rape|"marital exemption" in rape laws]] which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives.<ref name=Allison>{{cite book |last=Allison |first=Julie A. |year=1995 |title=Rape: The Misunderstood Crime |page=89}}</ref> Earlier efforts by first-wave feminists such as [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], [[Victoria Woodhull]] and [[Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy]] to criminalize marital rape in the late 19th century had failed;<ref name=Bland>{{cite book |last=Bland |first=Lucy |year=2002 |title=Banishing the Beast: Feminism, Sex and Morality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cl8nLdfgz1IC |accessdate=25 August 2013 |pages=135–49|isbn=9781860646812 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | issn = 1040-0656 | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 54–68 [60] | last = Palczewski | first = Catherine Helen | title = Voltairine de Cleyre: Sexual Slavery and Sexual Pleasure in the Nineteenth Century | journal = NWSA Journal | date = 1995-10-01 | jstor = 4316402 }}</ref> this was only achieved a century later in most Western countries, but is still not achieved in many other parts of the world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Crowell |first1=Nancy A. |last2=Burgess |first2=Ann W. |year=1997 |title=Understanding Violence Against Women |page=127}}</ref>

Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending [[Sexism|gender discrimination]].<ref name=NoTurningBack464/>

Second-wave feminists see women's cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures. The feminist activist and author [[Carol Hanisch]] coined the slogan "The Personal is Political", which became synonymous with the second wave.<ref name=Echols/><ref name=Hanisch>{{cite web |url=http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |title=Hanisch, New Intro to 'The Personal is Political' – Second Wave and Beyond |accessdate=8 June 2008 |last=Hanisch |first=Carol |date=1 January 2006 |website=The Personal Is Political |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515014413/http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |archive-date=15 May 2008}}</ref>

Second- and third-wave feminism in China has been characterized by a reexamination of women's roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements, and new discussions about whether women's equality has actually been fully achieved.<ref name="Dooling" />

In 1956, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Feminism in Egypt|Egypt]] initiated "[[state feminism]]", which outlawed [[Human rights in Egypt#Status of women|discrimination based on gender]] and granted women's suffrage, but also blocked political activism by feminist leaders.<ref>{{cite book |last=Badran |first=Margot |title=Feminists, Islam, and nation: gender and the making of modern Egypt |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-691-02605-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> During [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]]'s presidency, his wife, [[Jehan Sadat]], publicly advocated further women's rights, though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equality with the new [[Islamist]] movement and growing conservatism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Bonnie G. |title=Global feminisms since 1945 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-18491-5}}</ref> However, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, [[Islamic feminism]], which argues for women's equality within an Islamic framework.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/2004/16-31Jan04-Print-Edition/1631200425.htm |title=Islamic feminism means justice to women |website= The Mili Gazette |accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref>

In [[Feminism in Latin America|Latin America]], revolutions brought changes in women's status in countries such as [[Role of women in Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]], where [[feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution]] aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.<ref name="parpart">{{Cite book |last1=Parpart |first1=Jane L. |last2=Connelly |first2=M.

Third-wave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave's [[Essentialism|essentialist]] definitions of [[femininity]], which, third-wave feminists argued, over-emphasized the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focused on "[[wikt:micropolitics|micro-politics]]" and challenged the second wave's paradigm as to what was, or was not, good for women, and tended to use a [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality.<ref name=NoTurningBack464/><ref name=Henry>{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Astrid |title=Not my mother's sister: generational conflict and third-wave feminism |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-21713-4 |pages=1–288}}</ref><ref name=Gillis>{{cite book |last1=Gillis |first1=Stacy |last2=Howie |first2=Gillian |last3=Munford |first3=Rebecca |title=Third wave feminism: a critical exploration |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=978-0-230-52174-2 |pages=xxviii, 275–76}}</ref><ref name=Faludi>{{cite book |last=Faludi |first=Susan |author-link=Susan Faludi |title=Backlash: the undeclared war against women |year=1992 |publisher=Vintage |location=London |isbn=978-0-09-922271-2}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[bell hooks]], [[Chela Sandoval]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities.<ref name=Gillis/><ref name=Walker/><ref name=Heywood>{{cite book |last1=Leslie |first1=Heywood |last2=Drake |first2=Jennifer |title=Third Wave Agenda: Being Feminist, Doing Feminism |year=1997 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-3005-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thirdwaveagendab0000unse }}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> Third-wave feminism also contained internal debates between [[difference feminism|difference feminists]], who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to [[social conditioning]].<ref name=Gilligan>{{cite book |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |author-link=Carol Gilligan |title=In a different voice: psychological theory and women's development |url=https://archive.org/details/indifferentvoic000gill |url-access=registration |year=1993 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-44544-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/indifferentvoic000gill/page/184 184]}}</ref>

Standpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view stating that a person's social position influences their knowledge.

Fourth-wave feminism refers to a resurgence of interest in feminism that began around 2012 and is associated with the use of [[social media]].<ref name=4thWave-Guardian20131210/> According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to [[sexual harassment]] and [[violence against women]]. Its essence, she writes, is "incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist".<ref>{{cite book|last=Chamberlain|first=Prudence|title=The Feminist Fourth Wave: Affective Temporality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8AIkDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA115|year=2017|publisher=Springer|location=Cham|isbn=978-3-319-53682-8|page=115}}</ref>

Fourth-wave feminism is "defined by technology", according to [[Kira Cochrane]], and is characterized particularly by the use of [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]], and blogs such as [[Feministing]] to challenge [[misogyny]] and further [[gender equality]].<ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210">{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|author-link=Kira Cochrane|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|title=The Blogger and Author on the Life of Women Online|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|date=13 November 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|last=Zerbisias|first=Antonia|date=16 September 2015|website=NOW Toronto|access-date=21 April 2016}}</ref>

Issues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include [[street harassment|street]] and [[workplace harassment]], [[campus sexual assault]] and [[rape culture]].

==== Postfeminism ====
{{main|Postfeminism}}
The term [[postfeminism]] is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s. While not being "anti-feminist", postfeminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third- and fourth-wave feminist goals. The term was first used to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.<ref name=Wright2000>{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Elizabeth |title=Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) |year=2000 |publisher=Totem Books |isbn=978-1-84046-182-4}}</ref> Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.<ref name="Abbott">{{cite book |last1=Abbott |first1=Pamela |last2=Tyler |first2=Melissa |last3=Wallace |first3=Claire |title=An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives |date=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-38245-3 |page=[https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Sociology.html?id=PPp7dfrNTroC&q=no+longer+relevant xi] |edition=3rd}}</ref><ref name="Mateo–Gomez">{{cite book |last1=Mateo–Gomez |first1=Tatiana |editor1-last=Richter |editor1-first=William L. |title=Approaches to Political Thought |date=2009 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4616-3656-4 |page=[https://books.google.com/books/about/Approaches_to_Political_Thought.html?id=mQn-AAAAQBAJ&q=feminism+no+longer+relevant 279] |chapter=Feminist Criticism}}</ref> [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Amelia |chapter=Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art |title=New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action |editor1-first=Joana |editor1-last=Frueh |editor2-first=Cassandra L. |editor2-last=Langer |editor3-first=Arlene |editor3-last=Raven |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1994 |pages=16–41, 20}}</ref> Dorothy Chunn describes a "blaming narrative" under the postfeminist moniker, where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for [[gender equality]] in a "post-feminist" society, where "gender equality has (already) been achieved."

In the field of [[literary criticism]], [[Elaine Showalter]] describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases. The first she calls "feminist critique", in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls "[[gynocriticism]]", in which the "woman is producer of textual meaning". The last phase she calls "gender theory", in which the "ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system are explored".<ref name=showalter1979>{{cite book |last1=Showalter |first1=Elaine |author-link1=Elaine Showalter |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Jacobus |title=Women Writing about Women |year=1979 |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=978-0-85664-745-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/womenwritingwrit0000unse/page/25 25–36] |chapter=Towards a Feminist Poetics |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/womenwritingwrit0000unse/page/25 }}</ref>

This was paralleled in the 1970s by [[French structuralist feminism|French feminists]], who developed the concept of ''[[écriture féminine]]'' (which translates as 'female or feminine writing').<ref name=Wright2000/> [[Helene Cixous]] argues that writing and philosophy are ''[[Wikt:phallocentric|phallocentric]]'' and along with other French feminists such as [[Luce Irigaray]] emphasize "writing from the body" as a subversive exercise.<ref name=Wright2000/> The work of [[Julia Kristeva]], a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher, and [[Bracha Ettinger]],<ref>Ettinger, Bracha, 'The Matrixial Borderspace'.

However, as the scholar Elizabeth Wright points out, "none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] world".<ref name=Wright2000/><ref name=Moi1986>{{cite book |last1=Kristeva |first1=Julia |last2=Moi |first2=Toril |author-link2=Toril Moi |title=The Kristeva reader |year=1986 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-06325-8 |page=328}}</ref> More recent feminist theory, such as that of Lisa Lucile Owens,<ref>E.g., {{cite journal |title=Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' |first=Lisa Lucile |last=Owens |journal=Alabama Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=5 |page=1 |year=2003 |ssrn=2439294}}</ref> has concentrated on characterizing feminism as a universal emancipatory movement.

== Movements and ideologies ==
{{Main|Feminist movements and ideologies}}
Many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years. Traditionally feminism is often divided into three main traditions usually called liberal, radical and socialist/Marxist feminism, sometimes known as the "Big Three" schools of feminist thought; since the late 20th century a variety of newer forms of feminisms have also emerged.<ref name="Maynard">{{cite journal |last1=Maynard |first1=Mary |title=Beyond the ‘big three’: the development of feminist theory into the 1990s |journal=Women's History Review |date=1995|volume=4|issue=3|pages=259–281|doi=10.1080/09612029500200089}}</ref> Some branches of feminism track the political leanings of the larger society to a greater or lesser degree, or focus on specific topics, such as the environment.

=== Liberal feminism ===
{{Main|Liberal feminism}}
[[File:Elizabeth Stanton.jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], a major figure in 19th century liberal feminism]]
[[Liberal feminism]], also known under other names such as reformist, mainstream or historically as bourgeois feminism,<ref name="Voet">{{cite book |last1=Voet |first1=Rian |title=Feminism and Citizenship |date=1998 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=1446228045 |page=25|chapter=Categorizations of feminism}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Lindsey |first=Linda L. |date=2015 |title=Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective |publisher= Routledge |page=17 |isbn=9781317348085}}</ref> arose from 19th century first-wave feminism, and was historically linked to 19th century [[liberalism]] and [[progressivism]], while 19th century conservatives tended to oppose feminism as such. Liberal feminism seeks equality of men and women through political and [[legal reform]] within a [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] framework, without radically altering the structure of society; liberal feminism "works within the structure of mainstream society to integrate women into that structure."<ref>{{cite web |last1=West |first1=Rebecca |title=Kinds of Feminism |url=https://www.uah.edu/woolf/feminism_kinds.htm |publisher=University of Alabama in Huntsville}}</ref> During the 19th and early 20th centuries liberal feminism focused especially on [[women's suffrage]] and [[Female education|access to education]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Marilley |first1=Suzanne M. |title=Woman Suffrage and the Origins of Liberal Feminism in the United States, 1820–1920 |date=1996 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674954653}}</ref> Norwegian supreme court justice and former president of the liberal [[Norwegian Association for Women's Rights]], [[Karin Maria Bruzelius]], has described liberal feminism as "a realistic, sober, practical feminism".<ref>{{cite web |title=Hvem vi er |url=http://kvinnesak.no/om/ |publisher=Norwegian Association for Women's Rights|access-date=2020-10-28}}</ref>

Susan Wendell argues that "liberal feminism is an historical tradition that grew out of liberalism, as can be seen very clearly in the work of such feminists as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill, but feminists who took principles from that tradition have developed analyses and goals that go far beyond those of 18th and 19th century liberal feminists, and many feminists who have goals and strategies identified as liberal feminist [...] reject major components of liberalism" in a modern or party-political sense; she highlights "equality of opportunity" as a defining feature of liberal feminism.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Wendell|first=Susan|date=June 1987|title=A (Qualified) Defense of Liberal Feminism|journal=Hypatia|volume=2|issue=2|pages=65–93|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1987.tb01066.x|issn=0887-5367}}</ref>

Liberal feminism is a very broad term that encompasses many, often diverging modern branches and a variety of feminist and general political perspectives; some historically liberal branches are [[equality feminism]], [[social feminism]], [[equity feminism]], [[difference feminism]], [[individualist feminism|individualist/libertarian feminism]] and some forms of [[state feminism]], particularly the state feminism of the [[Nordic countries]]. The broad field of liberal feminism is sometimes confused with the more recent and smaller branch known as libertarian feminism, which tends to diverge significantly from mainstream liberal feminism. For example, "libertarian feminism does not require social measures to reduce material inequality; in fact, it opposes such measures [...] in contrast, liberal feminism may support such requirements and egalitarian versions of feminism insist on them."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mahowald |first1=Mary Briody |title=Genes, Women, Equality |date=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=145|chapter=Different Versions of Feminism}}</ref>

Catherine Rottenberg has criticized what she described as neoliberal feminism, which she described as individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality.<ref name="rotten"/> Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.<ref name="rotten">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/09502386.2013.857361|title = The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism|journal = Cultural Studies|volume = 28|issue = 3|pages = 418–437|year = 2014|last1 = Rottenberg|first1 = Catherine|url = http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/INFE/article/view/54954}}</ref>

Some modern forms of feminism that historically grew out of the broader liberal tradition have more recently also been described as [[List of conservative feminisms|conservative]] in relative terms. This is particularly the case for [[Individualist feminism|libertarian feminism]] which conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference.<ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy">{{cite book |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-liberal/#ClasCri |title=Liberal Feminism |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year=2018 }}</ref>

===Radical feminism===
[[File:Woman-power emblem.svg|upright=0.45|thumb|right|The merged [[Venus symbol]] with [[raised fist]] is a common symbol of [[radical feminism]], one of the movements within feminism]]

[[Radical feminism]] arose from the [[radical politics|radical]] wing of [[second-wave feminism]] and calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate [[androcentrism|male supremacy]]. It considers the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary.<ref name="Echols" /> [[Separatist feminism]] does not support heterosexual relationships. [[Lesbian feminism]] is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist.<ref name="hooks">{{cite book|last=hooks |first=bell |author-link=Bell hooks |year=2000 |title=Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics |publisher=[[South End Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-89608-629-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/feminismisforeve00hook }}</ref>

=== Materialist ideologies ===

===Other modern feminisms===

== Sexuality ==
{{Main|Feminist views on sexuality}}
[[Feminist views on sexuality]] vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions. Matters such as the [[sex industry]], sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in what came to be known as the [[feminist sex wars]], which pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates.<ref name=Duggan /><ref name=Hansen>{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Karen Tranberg |last2=Philipson |first2=Ilene J. |title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader |year=1990 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-87722-630-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/womenclassfemini0000unse }}</ref><ref name=Gerhard>{{cite book |author=Gerhard, Jane F. |title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-11204-8}}</ref><ref name=Leidholdt>{{cite book |last1=Leidholdt |first1=Dorchen |author-link=Dorchen Leidholdt |last2=Raymond |first2=Janice G. |title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-08-037457-4}}</ref><ref name=Vance>{{cite book |author=Vance, Carole S. |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=978-0-04-440593-1}}</ref> Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the [[sexual revolution]] from the 1960s and 70s.

=== Sex industry ===
{{main|Sex industry|Feminist views on pornography|Feminist views on prostitution|Feminist sex wars| Male prostitution#Feminist studies}}
Opinions on the sex industry are diverse. Feminists who are critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality. For the views of feminism on male prostitutes see the article on [[Male prostitution#Feminist studies|male prostitution]].

Feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of [[violence against women]], to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression.<ref name=Duggan>{{cite book|author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. |title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-91036-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sexwarssexualdis0000dugg/page/1 1–14] |url=https://archive.org/details/sexwarssexualdis0000dugg/page/1 }}</ref><ref name=Hansen/><ref name=Gerhard/><ref name=Leidholdt/><ref name=Vance/> Similarly, feminists' views on prostitution vary, ranging from critical to supportive.<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14–16}}</ref>

=== Affirming female sexual autonomy ===
{{See also|My body, my choice}}
For feminists, a woman's right to control her own [[Right to sexuality|sexuality]] is a key issue. Feminists such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argue that women have very little control over their own bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rohana Ariffin|author2=Women's Crisis Centre (Pinang, Malaysia)|title=Shame, secrecy, and silence: study on rape in Penang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfsDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2011|year=1997|publisher=Women's Crisis Centre|isbn=978-983-99348-0-9}}</ref><ref>Bennett L, Manderson L, Astbury J.

This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In [[conservative]] and religious cultures marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Jewkes R, Abrahams N |title= The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview|pmid=12365533|year=2002|volume=55|issue=7|pages=1231–44|journal=Social Science & Medicine|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00242-8}}</ref><ref>Sen P.

Lynn Hankinson Nelson writes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women.

The feminist movement produced [[feminist fiction]], [[feminist non-fiction]], and [[feminist poetry]], which created new interest in [[Women's writing (literary category)|women's writing]]. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.<ref name=Blain>{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia |author3=Grundy, Isobel |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/feministcompanio00blai/page/ vii–x] |url=https://archive.org/details/feministcompanio00blai/page/ }}</ref> There has also been a close link between feminist literature and [[activism]], with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era.

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like [[Dale Spender]]'s ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing.

Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels written by women.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sandra M. |last=Gilbert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260 |title=Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: women who created the novel |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 May 1986}}</ref> More recently, [[Broadview Press]] continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the [[University of Kentucky]] has a series of republications of early women's novels.

Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929) by [[Virginia Woolf]], is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.

The widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the [[literary canon]]. Interest in [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.<ref name="Blain" /><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix–x}}</ref> Most [[Literary genre|genres and subgenres]] have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies have entered new territories such as the "[[Gothic fiction#The female Gothic and the supernatural explained|female gothic]]"<ref>Term coined by Ellen Moers in ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' (New York: Doubleday, 1976).

According to Elyce Rae Helford, "Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice."<ref>{{cite book|author=Helford, Elyce Rae |editor-first=Gary |editor-last=Westfahl |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy |chapter=Feminist Science Fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/feministcompanio00blai/page/289 289–291] |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/feministcompanio00blai/page/289 }}</ref> Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15328023top1703_17 |title=Using Science Fiction to Teach the Psychology of Sex and Gender |year=1990 |last1=Lips |first1=Hilary M. |journal=Teaching of Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=197–98}}</ref> Notable texts of this kind are [[Ursula K.

Feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women's lived experiences. For example, [[Maya Angelou]]'s ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2018/08/10/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-review-maya-angelou/|title=I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings: Angelou's Quest to Truth and Power|last=Shah|first=Mahvish|date=2018|website=Feminism in India}}</ref>

In addition, many feminist movements have embraced [[poetry]] as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/144696/a-change-of-world|title=A Change of World|last=Poetry Foundation|date=2018-11-29|website=Poetry Foundation}}</ref>

Moreover, historical pieces of writing by women have been used by feminists to speak about what women's lives would have been like in the past, while demonstrating the power that they held and the impact they had in their communities even centuries ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Case|first=Sue-Ellen|date=December 1983|title=Re-Viewing Hrotsvit|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=35|issue=4|pages=533–542|doi=10.2307/3207334|jstor=3207334}}</ref> An important figure in the history of women in relation to literature is [[Hrotsvitha|Hrothsvitha]].

Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of [[Western canon|canon]], genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked.<ref name=mus/> Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like [[Susan McClary]], [[Marcia Citron]] and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and [[Female education|education of women]]; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.<ref name=mus/>

===Cinema===
{{main|Feminist film theory}}
{{see also|Women's cinema}}

Feminist cinema, advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives, arose largely with the development of [[feminist film theory]] in the late '60s and early '70s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women.<ref>Hayward S., ''Cinema Studies – The Key Concepts'', 3rd edn, Routledge, 2006;134–5.</ref> Differences were particularly marked between [[Feminist film theory#History|feminists on either side of the Atlantic]]. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, [[List of film periodicals|''Women and Film'']]. Trailblazers from this period included [[Claire Johnston]] and [[Laura Mulvey]], who also organized the Women's Event at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival|Edinburgh Film Festival]].<ref>Erens, P., ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism'', Wiley & Sons, 1991; 270.</ref> Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include [[Teresa de Lauretis]], Anneke Smelik and [[Kaja Silverman]]. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.

It has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent, theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking. 'Deconstruction' concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema, aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema. The second approach, a feminist counterculture, embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Kuhn |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Radstone |editor2-first=S. |title=Women's Companion to International Film |url=https://archive.org/details/womenscompaniont00kuhn |url-access=registration |publisher=Virago |year=1990 |page=[https://archive.org/details/womenscompaniont00kuhn/page/153 153]}}</ref> Some recent criticism<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/what-really-makes-a-film-feminist/281402/ |title=What really makes a feminist film? |work=[[The Atlantic]] |first=Holly L. |last=Derr |date=13 November 2013}}</ref> of "feminist film" approaches has centred around a Swedish rating system called the [[Bechdel test]].

Feminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the twentieth century.

=== Socialism ===
{{main|Left-wing politics#Social progressivism and counterculture|l1=Social Progressivism and Counterculture}}
Since the late nineteenth century, some feminists have allied with socialism, whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women's rights. [[August Bebel]], an early activist of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), published his work ''Die Frau und der Sozialismus'', juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general. In 1907 there was an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Stuttgart 1907|International Conference of Socialist Women]] in [[Stuttgart]] where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. [[Clara Zetkin]] of the SPD called for women's suffrage to build a "''socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women's question''".<ref>{{cite book |author=Badia, Gilbert |title=Zetkin.

In Britain, the women's movement was allied with the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]]. In the U.S., [[Betty Friedan]] emerged from a radical background to take leadership. [[Radical Women]] is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Radical Women Manifesto: Socialist Feminist Theory, Program and Organizational Structure |year=2001 |publisher=Red Letter Press |location=Seattle, WA |isbn=978-0-932323-11-8}}</ref> During the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Dolores Ibárruri]] (''La Pasionaria'') led the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]].

[[File:Feministas en lucha anti Pinochet (de Kena Lorenzini).jpg|thumb|Chilean feminists protest against the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–1990)|regime of Augusto Pinochet]]]]
Fascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the [[Fascist manifesto]] in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary groups such as the ''fasci femminilli'' and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s more conservative coalition partners.<ref name="hagg">{{cite book |last=Hägg |first=Göran |year=2008 |title=Mussolini: En studie i makt |trans-title=A study in power |language=sv |publisher=Norstedt |location=Stockholm |isbn=978-91-1-301949-9}}</ref><ref name="passmore">{{cite book |last=Passmore |first=Kevin |author-link=Definitions_of_fascism#Kevin_Passmore |year=2003 |title=Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919–45 |publisher=Rutgers Univ.

Cyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], feminism has a complicated relationship with the [[Nazi]] movement as well. While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women's equality in employment.<ref name=Blamires>{{cite book |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |last=Blamires |first=Cyprian |volume=1 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-940-9 |pages=232–33|year=2006 }}</ref> However, Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism,<ref name=Blamires/> and after the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre-war period and to some extent during the 1920s.<ref name=hww5/> Georges Duby et al. write that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position.<ref name=hww5>{{cite book|last1=Duby |first1=Georges |last2=Perrot |first2=Michelle |last3=Schmitt Pantel |first3=Pauline |title=A history of women in the West |year=1994 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-40369-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofwomenin00gold/page/600 600] |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofwomenin00gold/page/600 }}</ref> Blamires also writes that Neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept "their traditional roles".<ref name=Blamires/>

=== Civil rights movement and anti-racism ===
The [[civil rights movement]] has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights and the rights of non-white people.<ref name="Levy">{{cite book|last=Levy |first=Peter |year=1998 |title=The Civil Rights Movement |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-29854-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/civilrightsmovem00levy }}</ref> Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tensions arose during the late 1960s and the 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white, straight, and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with issues of race and sexuality.<ref>{{cite book |last=Code |first=Lorraine |title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories |chapter=Civil rights |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-13274-9 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffe0000unse |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffe0000unse }}</ref> Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist and [[Homophobia|homophobic]] elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns.<ref name="Levy" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=hooks|first=bell|date=2014-10-03|title=Feminist Theory|doi=10.4324/9781315743172|isbn=9781315743172}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Manditch-Prottas|first=Zachary|date=2019|title=Meeting at the Watchtower: Eldridge Cleaver, James Baldwin's No Name in the Street, and Racializing Homophobic Vernacular|journal=African American Review|volume=52|issue=2|pages=179–195|doi=10.1353/afa.2019.0027|issn=1945-6182}}</ref>  These criticisms created new feminist social theories about identity politics and the intersections of [[racism]], [[classism]], and [[sexism]]; they also generated new feminisms such as [[black feminism]] and [[Chicana feminism]] in addition to making large contributions to [[lesbian feminism]] and other integrations of [[Queer of color critique|queer of colour]] identity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roth |first=Benita |title=Separate Roads to Feminism: Black, Chicana, and White feminist movements in America's second wave |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-52972-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/separateroadstof00roth }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Winddance Twine |first1=France |first2=Kathleen M. |last2=Blee |title=Feminism and Antiracism: International struggles for justice |publisher=NYU Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8147-9855-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/feminismantiraci0000unse }}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title="The Combahee River Collective Statement" (1977)|work=Available Means|pages=292–300|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=9780822979753|doi=10.2307/j.ctt5hjqnj.50|year=2001}}</ref>

===Neoliberalism===

Some feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to [[child sexual abuse]]. The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men's responsibility for their own conduct, the men being adults.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rush |first=Florence |author-link=Florence Rush |year=1988 |title=The Best Kept Secret: Sexual Abuse of Children |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs |isbn=978-0070542235}}</ref>

In the U.S., the [[National Organization for Women]] ([[National Organization for Women|NOW]]) began in 1966 to seek women's equality, including through the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] ([[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://now.org/about/history/statement-of-purpose/|title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose}}</ref> which did not pass, although [[Equal Rights Amendment#State constitutions|some states enacted their own]]. [[Reproductive rights]] in the U.S. centred on the court decision in [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe'' v. ''Wade'']] enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable [[birth control]], allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under [[Margaret Sanger]] and elsewhere under [[Marie Stopes]]. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through [[birth control]], which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1676.html|title=Margaret Sanger}}</ref>

=== Jurisprudence ===
{{Main|Feminist legal theory}}

Feminist jurisprudence is a branch of [[jurisprudence]] that examines the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights.<ref name="blacks">{{cite book |year=2014 |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Bryan |editor-link=Bryan A.

Feminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the [[Philosophy of law|philosophical approach]] of modern [[Law#Legal theory|legal scholars]], who typically see the law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals.

Feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.<ref name=Bundesen>{{cite book |author=Bundesen, Lynne |title=The Feminine Spirit: Recapturing the Heart of Scripture |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-8495-3|date=2007-03-30 }}</ref>

[[Christian feminism]] is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the [[Christian egalitarianism|equality]] of [[Women in Christianity|women]] and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the [[ordination of women]], male dominance and the balance of parenting in [[Christian views on marriage|Christian marriage]], claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church.<ref name=Haddad>{{cite journal |author=Haddad, Mimi |title=Egalitarian Pioneers: Betty Friedan or Catherine Booth? |journal=Priscilla Papers |volume=20 |issue=4 |date=2006 |url=http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713193304/http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |archive-date=13 July 2015  }}</ref><ref name=andeson>{{cite book |author=Anderson, Pamela Sue |author2=Clack, Beverley |title=Feminist philosophy of religion: critical readings |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-25749-7}}</ref>

[[Buddhist feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and [[social status]] of [[Women in Buddhism|women within Buddhism]].

Patriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures. In this system, fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege and is dependent on female subordination.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Encyclopedia of sex and gender |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Reference |location=Detroit, Mich.}}</ref> Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women.

=== Pro-feminism ===
{{main|Pro-feminism}}
Pro-feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, [[men's studies]], and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.<ref name=Lingard>{{Cite book |last1=Lingard |first1=Bob |last2=Douglas |first2=Peter |title=Men Engaging Feminisms: Pro-Feminism, Backlashes and Schooling |year=1999 |publisher=Open University Press |location=Buckingham, England |isbn=978-0-335-19818-4 |page=192}}</ref><ref name="Kimmel-Tide">{{Cite book|last1=Kimmel |first1=Michael S. |author-link1=Michael Kimmel |last2=Mosmiller |first2=Thomas E. |title=Against the Tide: Pro-Feminist Men in the United States, 1776–1990: A Documentary History |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8070-6767-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/againsttide00rces }}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}</ref>

In the 19th century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWj5OBvTh1IC&pg=PA35 |chapter=Antifeminism |first=Michael |last=Kimmel |author-link=Michael Kimmel | editor-last1 = Kimmel | editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last2 = Aronson | editor-first2 = Amy | editor-link1 = Michael Kimmel | editor-link2 = Amy Aronson | title = Men and masculinities a social, cultural, and historical encyclopedia | pages = 35–37 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781576077740 }}</ref>

Some people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs.  Anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained.<ref>{{citation | last = Lukas | first = Carrie | author-link = Carrie Lukas | contribution = Marriage: happier ever after | editor-last = Lukas | editor-first = Carrie | editor-link = Carrie Lukas | title = The politically incorrect guide to women, sex, and feminism | page = [https://archive.org/details/politicallyincor0000luka/page/75 75] | publisher = Regency Publishing | location = Washington, DC Lanham, Maryland | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781596980037 | quote = Feminists' assault on marriage also has played a role in devaluing marriage.

===Secular humanism===
[[Secular humanism]] is an ethical framework that attempts to dispense with any unreasoned dogma, pseudoscience, and superstition. Critics of feminism{{Who|date=November 2020}} sometimes ask "Why feminism and not humanism?" Some humanists argue, however, that the goals of feminists and humanists largely overlap, and the distinction is only in motivation. For example, a humanist may consider abortion in terms of a utilitarian ethical framework, rather than considering the motivation of any particular woman in getting an abortion. In this respect, it is possible to be a humanist without being a feminist, but this does not preclude the existence of feminist humanism.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Doran |first1=Tatiana |last2=West |first2=Robin |title=Feminism or Humanism? |journal=The Yale Law Journal |date=June 1998 |volume=107 |issue=8 |pages=2661 |doi=10.2307/797353 |jstor=797353 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Cordelia Tucker|last= O’Sullivan |title=Why Humanism and feminism go hand in hand |url=http://humanistlife.org.uk/2015/03/07/why-humanism-and-feminism-go-hand-in-hand/ |website=HumanistLife |accessdate=9 January 2019 |date=7 March 2015}}</ref> Humanism plays a significant role in protofeminism during the renaissance period in such that humanists made educated women a popular figure despite the challenge to the male patriarchal organization of society.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=The birth of feminism : woman as intellect in renaissance Italy and England|last=Ross, Sarah Gwyneth, 1975-|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03454-9|oclc=517501929}}</ref>
