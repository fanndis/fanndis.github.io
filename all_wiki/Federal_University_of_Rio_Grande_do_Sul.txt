==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
[[Image:ufrgs entrance.jpg|thumb|left|UFRGS Entrance|200px]]
The university originated from the ''Escola de Farmácia e Química'' (School of [[Pharmacy]] and [[Chemistry]]) in 1895. It was expanded in 1896, when the Engineering College was created. This was the beginning of [[higher education]] in [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. In the end of the 19th century, the [[Medicine]] and [[Law]] schools were founded, the latter being the first school of [[humanities]] [[tertiary education]] in the state.

In November 1934, the ''Universidade de Porto Alegre'' (University of Porto Alegre) was founded, initially composed of the following units:

* Engineering School, with its [[Astronomy]], [[Electronics]] and Industrial [[Chemistry]] institutes;
* Medical College, with its [[Dentistry]] and [[Pharmacy]] institutes;
* Law College, with the School of [[Commerce]];
* [[Communication theory|Communication]] College (called FABICO), which comprises the [[Journalism]], [[Advertising]] and [[Public Relations]] programs;
* [[Agricultural Science]] and [[Veterinary Medicine]] Colleges;
* [[Philosophy]], Science and [[Linguistics]] Colleges; and
* Institute of [[Fine Arts]]

The third transformation took place in 1947, when it became the ''Universidade do Rio Grande do Sul'' (University of Rio Grande do Sul), URGS, incorporating the Law and Dentistry Colleges from [[Pelotas]] and with the Pharmacy College from [[Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul|Santa Maria]]. These units, however, separated from URGS when the Federal Universities of Pelotas and Santa Maria were founded.

In December 1950, control of the university passed to the [[Politics of Brazil|Federal Government]]. After that, the name of the institution became ''Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul'' (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul).
The institute also has a profound political history. Between 1964 and 1969, during the worst years of the [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]], 33 professors were eliminated, as well as a good number of students{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}. Many high-ranking officials, including three presidents - [[Getúlio Vargas]] and [[João Goulart]] - as well as the majority of the history, philosophy and social sciences teachers in smaller universities throughout the state were educated in the institution. The climate of intellectual debate and analysis of public issues has also been important in training students (often with scholarships and/or student apprenticeships) to work for non-governmental and governmental organisations which contribute to the critical reflection and planning of development programs.

==Organization==

UFRGS is almost completely located in Porto Alegre, with four campi: ''Campus Centro'' (Downtown Campus), ''Campus Saúde'' (Health Sciences Campus), ''Campus Olímpico'' (Olympic Campus, housing the School of Physical Education, Physitherapy and Dance) and ''Campus do Vale'' (Vale Campus), a few off-campus buildings (including the Business School and the Institute of Arts) and units in other cities, such as the Agriculture Experimental Station and the Campus Litoral Norte (a new campus in the state's northeastern coastal city of Tramandaí).

===Infrastructure===

Offering graduate and undergraduate courses, UFRGS is the largest university of Rio Grande do Sul. Its more than 300 buildings accommodate 29 faculties, schools and institutes, which are divided into 94 departments.

The university spreads through 2,185 ha, and it has 402,000 m² of constructed area. It is divided into four campi and minor units (see above).

The undergraduate program’s students make up for a population of about 31 thousand students, while the graduate program has 12 thousand students. The elementary, high-school and technical school sum up to 1,300 students.

The university’s infrastructure comprises more than 500 laboratories, 33 libraries, 37 lecture halls, the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (the University's clinical research hospital), UFRGS Press, UFRGS Museum, Botanical Garden, Broadcasting Center, Observatory, 3 buildings for Campus Accommodation, 5 refectories, 2 summer camps and several other centers and facilities.

==Admission==
{{further|Vestibular}}
Students are accepted through the vestibular, which is an open examination where the top-placed candidates are offered a placement at the university. Since UFRGS is free of charge, the Vestibular is usually a very hard examination since there are many candidates for few open placements.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jon|last=Jeter|title=Affirmative Action Debate Forces Brazil to Take Look in the Mirror|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A62685-2003Jun15?language=printer|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 16, 2003|accessdate=2011-08-25}}</ref> Examinations take place in January and classes begin in March.

===ENEM===
{{further|Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio}}
The Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, as well as the other Brazilian federal universities, adopted the National High School Examination (ENEM) in 2010 as a standard of admission. The applicants’ participation in ENEM is optative. Hence, their performances in the examination are analyzed together with their performances in the university entrance exam, comprehending 10% of the final grade.
