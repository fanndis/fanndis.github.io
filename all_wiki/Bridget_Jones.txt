'''''Bridget Jones''''' is a fictional character created by British writer [[Helen Fielding]]. Jones first appeared in Fielding's ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' column in ''[[The Independent]]'' in 1995, which - crucially - did not carry any [[byline]]. Thus, it seemed to be an actual personal diary chronicling the life of Jones as a thirtysomething single woman in [[London]] as she tries to make sense of life, love, and relationships with the help of a surrogate "urban family" of friends in the 1990s. The column was, in fact, a lampoon of women's [[Romance (love)|obsession with love, marriage and romance]] as well as [[women's magazines]] such as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and wider social trends in Britain at the time. Fielding published the novelisation of the column in 1996, followed by a sequel in 1999 called ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]''.

Both novels were adapted for film in 2001 and 2004, starring [[Renée Zellweger]] as Bridget Jones, and [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Colin Firth]] as the men in her life: Daniel Cleaver and Mark Darcy, respectively. After Fielding had ceased to work for ''The Daily Telegraph'' in late 1998, the feature began again in ''The Independent'' on 4 August 2005 and finished in June 2006. Helen Fielding released a third novel in 2013 (''Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy'', which is set 14 years after the events of the second novel) and a fourth in 2016 (''Bridget Jones's Baby: The Diaries'', where Bridget finds herself unexpectedly pregnant without being certain who the father is).

"Bridget Jones" is hailed as a  [[List of cultural icons of England|British Culture Icon]] and was named on the 2016 ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' Power List as one of seven women judged to have had the biggest impact on women's lives over the past 70 years.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38303886 "Margaret Thatcher tops Woman's Hour Power List"], BBC News (Arts & Entertainment), 14 December 2016.</ref>

==Plot summary==

===Original column and novelizations===
Bridget Jones is a [[Bangor University]] graduate. She is a 32-year-old single woman whose life is a satirized version of the stereotypical single London 30-something in the 1990s and very unlucky in love. She has some bad habits—smoking and drinking—but she annually writes her [[New Year's resolutions]] in her [[diary]], determined to stop smoking, drink no more than 14 alcohol units a week, and eat more "[[pulse (legume)|pulse]]s" and try her best to lose weight. 

In the two novels and screen adaptations, Bridget's mother is bored with her life as a housewife in the country and leaves Bridget's father. Bridget repeatedly flirts with her boss, Daniel Cleaver. A successful [[barrister]] named Mark Darcy also keeps popping into Bridget's life, being extremely awkward, and sometimes coming off a bit rude. After Bridget and Mark reach an understanding of each other and find a sort of happiness together, she gains some self-confidence and dramatically cuts down on her alcohol and cigarette consumption. However, Bridget's obsession with [[self-help book]]s plus several misunderstandings cannot keep the couple together forever.

===Return to the ''Independent''===
The new ''Independent'' column was set in the then-present day of 2005 and 2006, with references being made to events such as [[River Thames whale]],<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Jones, Bridget ([[Helen Fielding|Fielding, Helen]]) |title=Bridget Jones's Diary &ndash; Monday 23 January |work=The Independent}}</ref> and has dropped some of the motifs of the original diary, particularly the [[alcohol unit]] and calorie counts. Despite the time advance, Cleaver and Darcy were still the two men in Jones' life<ref name=suffer /> ("I'm not sleeping with them both at once," she explains later to her friend Shazza. "I accidentally slept with each of them separately"),<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Jones, Bridget (Fielding, Helen) |title=Bridget Jones's Diary &ndash; Wednesday 17 August |work=The Independent}}</ref> and the plot line launched into a [[pregnancy]]. As Fielding said, "she's heading in a different direction."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4732295.stm |title= Bridget Jones back in new diary |work=[[BBC News]] |date=4 August 2005 |accessdate=2008-06-22}}</ref> 

The column is continued into 2006. In the last entry, Bridget Jones gave birth to a baby boy, fathered by Daniel Cleaver, and moved in with him.<ref name=last>{{cite journal |authors=Jones, Bridget (Fielding, Helen) |title=Bridget Jones's Diary &ndash; Saturday 10 June |work=The Independent}}</ref> However, Mark was not entirely out of the picture, as he previously suggested that he would like to adopt the child.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Jones, Bridget ([[Helen Fielding|Fielding, Helen]]) |title=Bridget Jones's Diary &ndash; Tuesday 21 March |work=The Independent |quote=[telephone call] 'Bridget, it's Mark.

==History==

===Original column===
In the mid-'90s, [[Charles Leadbeater]], at the time the features editor of the English newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'', offered [[Helen Fielding]], then a journalist on ''The Independent on Sunday'', a weekly column about urban life in London designed to appeal to young professional women. Fielding accepted and Bridget Jones was born on 28 February 1995.<ref>[http://bridgetarchive.altervista.org/index1995.htm Independent Columns 1995<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The instantaneous popularity of the columns led to publication of the first book, ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'', in 1996.

The column appeared regularly every Wednesday on the pages of ''The Independent'' for almost three years: the last one was published on 10 September 1997. A couple of months later, on 15 November 1997, Helen Fielding resumed her weekly diary in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref>[http://bridgetarchive.altervista.org/index1997b.htm Telegraph Columns 1997<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Fielding ceased to work for ''The Daily Telegraph'' on 19 December 1998.

====Novelizations====
{{Main|Bridget Jones's Diary|Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason}}
The column was made into a [[novel]] in 1996, ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. The plot is very loosely based on ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' by [[Jane Austen]].  Critics assert that Fielding's book arguably began the popular fiction movement known as [[chick lit]]. The second book, ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]'', was published on 1998, and was based on the plot of another of Austen's novels, ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]''.

Fielding named the character of Mark Darcy after the ''Pride and Prejudice'' character [[Fitzwilliam Darcy]] and described him exactly like [[Colin Firth]], who played Mr Darcy in the [[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|1995 BBC adaptation]].<ref name=hottie /> Mark Darcy was also partly modelled on a friend of Fielding's called Mark Muller, a barrister with chambers in [[Gray's Inn Square]]; and the Kurdish revolutionary leader whom Darcy defends in the movie was inspired by a real case of Muller's.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cartner-Morley |first=Jess |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,471825,00.html |title=The real Mr Darcy |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> The character of Shazzer was reportedly based on Sharon Maguire, who is a friend of Fielding and would become director of the film.<ref>Director [[Sharon Maguire]] in the audio commentary for ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]''.</ref>

A third book was published in October 2013, titled ''Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy''. The novel is set in present-day London; Bridget is 51, still keeping a diary, but is also immersed in texting and experimenting with social media.<ref>{{cite web |last=Capon |first=Felicity|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/10084448/Bridget-Jones-returns-in-new-title-Mad-About-the-Boy.html |title=Bridget Jones returns in new title, Mad About the Boy |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=28 May 2013 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}</ref> It is revealed in the book that Mark Darcy had died five years earlier and that they have two children, Billy and Mabel, aged seven and five respectively. Publication of the novel was set for "Super Thursday", in preparation for Christmas. However, a mistake occurred in the early book prints which combined sections of the novel with [[Sir David Jason|Sir David Jason's]] autobiography. [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] explained the error as "a Bridget moment" and recalled the books.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-24479822|title=Misprint hits Bridget Jones book|date=2013-10-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Return to ''The Independent''===
The feature began again in ''The Independent'' on 4 August 2005 with a "Sunday 31 July" entry. A book containing the original columns for 1995 was given away with the paper the following Saturday. This relaunch of the column is also printed in the ''[[Irish Independent]]''. The ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' reviewed the new column rather favourably, commenting that Fielding's satire was in good form.<ref name=suffer>{{cite news |last=James |first=Caryn |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/08/19/features/bridget.php |title=Bridget suffers through a new serial |newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=20 August 2005 |accessdate=2008-06-22}}</ref>

===Connections to ''Pride and Prejudice''===
Helen Fielding (as Bridget Jones) wrote of her love of the [[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV serial)|1995 BBC adaptation of ''Pride and Prejudice'']] in her ''Bridget Jones's Diary'' column during the original British broadcast,<ref name=twice_shy>{{cite web |last=Steiner |first=Susie |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,465976,00.html |title=Twice Shy |work=The Guardian |date=31 March 2001 |accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> mentioning her "simple human need for [[Fitzwilliam Darcy|Darcy]] to get off with [[Elizabeth Bennet|Elizabeth]]" and regarding the couple as her "chosen representatives in the field of shagging, or rather courtship".<ref name=jones>{{Cite journal |authors=Jones, Bridget ([[Helen Fielding|Fielding, Helen]]) |title=Bridget Jones's Diary |work=The Independent |date=25 October 1995 |page=5 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Fielding loosely reworked the plot of ''Pride and Prejudice'' in her 1996 novelization of the column, naming Bridget's uptight love interest "Mark Darcy" and describing him exactly like Colin Firth.<ref name=hottie>{{cite news |last=Pearlman |first=Cindy |title=Brit Colin Firth is newest hottie |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=4 May 2001 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref name=twice_shy /> Following a first meeting with Firth during his filming of ''[[Fever Pitch (1997 film)|Fever Pitch]]'' in 1996, Fielding asked him to collaborate in what would become an eight-page interview between Bridget Jones and Firth in her 1999 sequel novel, ''Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason''. Conducting the real interview with Firth in [[Rome]], Fielding lapsed into Bridget Jones mode and obsessed over Darcy in his wet shirt. Firth participated in the following editing process of what critics would consider "one of the funniest sequences in the diary's sequel".<ref name=renaissance>{{cite news |last=Ryan |first=Tom |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/03/1078295440766.html |title=Renaissance man |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=6 March 2004 |accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Grice |first=Elizabeth |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/04/03/bfcolin.xml |title=He's back - without the breeches |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=3 April 2001 |accessdate=2008-06-03}}</ref> Both novels make various other references to the BBC serial.<ref>{{cite web |last=Salber |first=Cecilia |url=http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol22no1/salber.html |title=Bridget Jones and Mark Darcy: Art Imitating Art ...

''Pride and Prejudice'' screenwriter Andrew Davies collaborated on the screenplays for the 2001 and 2004 ''Bridget Jones'' films, which would show [[Crispin Bonham-Carter]] (Mr Bingley in ''Pride and Prejudice'') and [[Lucy Robinson (actress)|Lucy Robinson]] (Mrs Hurst) in minor roles. The self-referential in-joke between the projects intrigued Colin Firth to accept the role of Mark Darcy,<ref name=twice_shy /> as it gave him an opportunity to ridicule and liberate himself from his ''Pride and Prejudice'' character.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Faillaci |first=Sara |title=Me Sexy? |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] (Italy) |date=16 October 2003 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Film critic [[James Berardinelli]] would later state that Firth "plays this part [of Mark Darcy] exactly as he played the earlier role, making it evident that the two Darcys are essentially the same".<ref>{{cite web |last=Berardinelli |first=James |authorlink=James Berardinelli |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/b/bridget.html |title=Bridget Jones's Diary |publisher=[[ReelViews]] |year=2001 |accessdate=2008-05-21}}</ref> The producers never found a solution to incorporate the ''Jones'' Firth interview in the second film but shot a spoof interview with Firth as himself and [[Renée Zellweger]] staying in-character as Bridget Jones after a day's wrap. The scene is available as a [[deleted scene]] on [[DVD]].<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Beeban Kidron|Kidron, Beeban]] |title=[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (film)|Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]] &ndash; Deleted scenes |medium=DVD |publisher=[[United International Pictures]] |date=2004}}</ref>

==Adaptations==

===Screen===
{{Main|Bridget Jones (film series)}}

The first novel was turned into a [[Bridget Jones's Diary (2001 film)|movie of the same name]] in 2001, directed by [[Sharon Maguire]]. The movie starred [[Renée Zellweger]] as Bridget, [[Hugh Grant]] as Daniel Cleaver and [[Colin Firth]] as Mark Darcy. Before the film was released, a considerable amount of controversy surrounded the casting of the [[United States|American]] Zellweger as what some saw as a quintessentially [[United Kingdom|British]] heroine: however, her performance is widely considered to be of a high standard, including a perfect English accent, and garnered Zellweger a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. A [[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (film)|second film]] was released in 2004, directed by [[Beeban Kidron]]. There are many differences between the books and the films. A third movie, ''[[Bridget Jones's Baby]]'', was released on 16 September 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8152292.stm |title= Third Bridget Jones in pipeline |work=[[BBC News]] |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> [[Patrick Dempsey]] was cast as Jack Qwant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/patrick-dempsey-set-to-star-in-bridget-joness-baby-after-greys-exit-201599 |title=Patrick Dempsey Set to Star in Bridget Jones' Baby |work=[[US Magazine]] |date=9 September 2015}}</ref>

===Musical===
{{Main|Bridget Jones' Diary (musical)}}

[[Lily Allen]] wrote a musical based on the novel, which was 'workshopped' in London with a cast including [[Sheridan Smith]] in the title role. Although a full production was anticipated for some time, Allen has since says she doubts it will 'see the light of day'.
