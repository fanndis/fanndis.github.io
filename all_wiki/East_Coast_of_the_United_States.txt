The '''East Coast of the United States''', also known as the '''Eastern Seaboard''', the '''Atlantic Coast''', and the '''Atlantic Seaboard''', is the [[coast|coastline]] along which the [[Eastern United States]] meets the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]]. Regionally, the term refers to the [[coastal states]] and area east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] that have [[shoreline]] on the Atlantic Ocean, from north to south, [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]].<ref name="East Coast States">[http://www.nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/pdf/reference/genref.pdf General Reference Map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017072239/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/pdf/reference/genref.pdf |date=October 17, 2012 }}, [[National Atlas of the United States]], 2003.</ref>

==Toponymy and composition==
The [[Toponymy|place name]] "East Coast" derives from the idea that the contiguous 48 states are defined by two major coastlines, one at the [[West Coast of the United States|western edge]] and one on the eastern edge. Other terms for referring to this area include the "Eastern [[wikt:seaboard|Seaboard]]" ("seaboard" being American English for [[coast]]), "Atlantic Coast", and "Atlantic Seaboard" (because the coastline lies along the [[Atlantic Ocean]]).

The 14 states that have a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]].<ref name="East Coast States" /> In addition, [[Pennsylvania]] and the [[District of Columbia]] border tidal arms of the Atlantic (the [[Delaware River]] and the [[Potomac River]], respectively). The states of [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Texas]] (via the [[Gulf of Mexico]]), as well as the territories of [[Puerto Rico]], the [[US Virgin Islands]], and [[Navassa Island]] (the latter only bordering the [[Caribbean Sea]]) have Atlantic coastline, but are not included in the definition.

Although [[Vermont]] and [[West Virginia]] have no Atlantic coastline, they are grouped with the Eastern Seaboard states because of their locations in [[New England]] and the [[Old South]],<ref>{{cite web|title=NOAA Chart Locator|url=http://www.mapshop.com/NOAA-Charts/NOAA-Chart-locator_East-Coast.htm|publisher=National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=Feb 21, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309193454/http://www.mapshop.com/NOAA-Charts/NOAA-Chart-locator_East-Coast.htm|archivedate=March 9, 2013}}</ref> and their history as part of the land base of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] (viz. the [[Colony of New Hampshire]], the [[Colony of New York]] and the [[Colony of Virginia]]).

==Colonial history==
The original [[13 colonies]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in North America all lay along the East Coast.{{efn|Those colonies were New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. While Pennsylvania is not directly along the Atlantic shoreline, it borders the tidal portion of the [[Delaware River]], and the city of [[Philadelphia]] was a major seaport.}}

Two additional [[U.S. state]]s on the East Coast were not among the original thirteen colonies: [[History of Maine|Maine]] (became part of the English colony of Massachusetts in 1677)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mainememory.net/sitebuilder/site/895/page/1306/display?page=3|title=1500-1667 Contact & Conflict|website=Maine History Online}}</ref> and [[History of Florida|Florida]] (part of [[New Spain]] until 1821, though held by the British from after the end of the [[French and Indian War]] until 1781). [[Florida]]'s written history begins with the arrival of Europeans; the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León in 1513 made the first textual records. The state received its name from this Spanish conquistador, who called the peninsula La Pascua Florida in recognition of the verdant landscape and because it was the Easter season, which the Spaniards called Pascua Florida (Festival of Flowers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flheritage.com/facts/history/summary/index.cfm|title=A Brief History - Florida Department of State|website=www.flheritage.com}}</ref>

The [[Middle Colonies]] (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware) had been owned by [[Dutch Republic|the Dutch]] as [[New Netherland]], until they were captured by [[Kingdom of England|the English]] in the mid-to-late 17th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Climate and physical geography==
There are three basic climate regions on the East Coast according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] from north to south based on the monthly mean temperature of the coldest month (January):

The region from northern Maine south to northern Connecticut has a [[continental climate]], with warm summers, and cold and snowy winters. The area from southern Connecticut south to southern North Carolina has a [[temperate climate]], with long, hot summers and cool winters, while the area from southern North Carolina south to central Florida is [[subtropical]], with hot and rainy summers, and mild and drier winters. Around south-central Florida southward ([[Stuart, Florida|Stuart]], south through the [[Florida Keys]]) has a [[tropical climate]], which is frost free and is warm to hot all year.

Average monthly precipitation ranges from a slight late fall (November) maximum from Massachusetts northward (as at [[Portland, Maine]]), to a slight summer maximum in the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] from southern Connecticut south to Virginia (as at [[Wilmington, Delaware]], and [[Norfolk, Virginia]]), to a more pronounced summer maximum from [[Cape Hatteras]], North Carolina, southward along the [[Southeastern United States]] coast to [[Savannah, Georgia]]. The Florida peninsula has a sharp wet-summer/dry-winter pattern, with 60 to 70 percent of precipitation falling between June and October in an average year, and a dry, and sunny late fall, winter, and early spring.

Although landfalls are rare, the Eastern seaboard is susceptible to [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s in the Atlantic hurricane season, officially running from June 1 to November 30, although hurricanes can occur before or after these dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions: When is hurricane season? |author=Neal Dorst |publisher=Hurricane Research Division, [[NOAA]] |access-date=March 14, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506152735/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html |archivedate=May 6, 2009 }}</ref> Hurricanes [[Hurricane Hazel|Hazel]], [[Hurricane Hugo|Hugo]], [[Hurricane Bob|Bob]], [[Hurricane Isabel|Isabel]], [[Hurricane Irene|Irene]], [[Hurricane Sandy|Sandy]], and most recently [[Hurricane Florence|Florence]] and [[Hurricane Isaias|Isaias]] are some of the more significant storms to have affected the region.

The East Coast is a low-relief, [[passive margin]] coast.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkVqmi0MO1IC&pg=PA575 | title=Physical Geography| page=575| first1=Robert E.| last1=Gabler| first2=James F.| last2=Petersen| first3=L. Michael| last3=Trapasso| first4=Dorothy| last4=Sack| publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]| date=2008| access-date=March 14, 2016| isbn=978-0495555063}}</ref> It has been shaped by the [[Pleistocene glaciation]] in the far northern areas in New England, with offshore islands such as [[Nantucket]], [[Block Island]], [[Fishers Island, and New York|Fishers Island]]. From around northern New Jersey southward, the coastal plain broadens southwards, separated from the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region by the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]] of the East Coast rivers, often marking the head of navigation and prominent sites of cities. The coastal areas from Long Island south to Florida are often made up of [[barrier island]]s that front the coastal areas, with the long stretches of sandy beaches. Many of the larger capes along the lower East Coast are in fact barrier islands, like the [[Outer Banks]] of North Carolina and [[Cape Canaveral]], Florida. The [[Florida Keys]] are made up of limestone coral and provide the only [[coral reef]]s on the US mainland.

==Demographics==
In 2010, the population of the states which have shoreline on the East Coast was estimated at 112,642,503 (36% of the country's total population). New York City is both the largest city and the largest metropolitan area on the East Coast. The East Coast is the most populated coastal area in the United States.<ref>[http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php 2010 Census: Resident Population Data] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019160532/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |date=October 19, 2013 }}</ref>

Some of the largest airports in the United States are located along the East Coast of the United States, such as [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York, [[Logan International Airport]] in Boston, [[Newark Liberty Airport]] in Newark, New Jersey, [[Philadelphia International Airport]] in Philadelphia, [[Baltimore–Washington International Airport]] near Baltimore, [[Washington-Dulles International Airport]] near Washington, D.C., [[Hartsfield International Airport]] in Atlanta, [[Miami International Airport]] in Miami, [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport]] in Charlotte, North Carolina, [[Tampa International Airport]] in Tampa and [[Orlando International Airport]] in Orlando, Florida.

==Culture==

As the first spot in the United States that immigrants arrived and the close proximity of [[Europe]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[Latin America]], the East Coast is home to a diverse population and home to multi-cultures when compared to the rest of the USA. From the strong [[Latin]] culture in [[southern Florida]] and [[New York City]], to the 200 year old [[Gullah]] culture of the low country coastal islands of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]], to the many historic cities in the Middle Atlantic where a strong English, German, Italian, Irish, and French culture are present, the East Coast is significantly more diverse than the rest of the United States. [[Chinatown]] in [[New York City]] and [[Little Havana]] in [[Miami]] are examples of such cultural centers in the bigger cities, .

The East Coast is home to much of the political and financial power of the United States, as well as the center for resort and travel destinations in the United States. [[New York City]] is the largest city and financial capital of the United States and one of the top financial powerhouse cities in the world. Seventy-one of the worlds fortune 500 companies have their corporate headquarters in New York City, while [[Midtown Manhattan]] with 400 million square feet of office space in 2018, is the largest central business district in the world. [[Washington, D.C.]] is the capital and political nerve center of the United States. Many organizations such as defense contractors, civilian contractors, nonprofit organizations, lobbying firms, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations have their headquarters in or near Washington, D.C., in order to be close to the federal government. 

[[Miami]] and Florida are one of the top domestic and international travel destinations in the United States. Miami is the warmest major city in the United States in winter, this factor contributes to it being a major tourism hub for international visitors. Miami has one of the largest concentrations of international banks in the United States, and the third tallest skyline in the U.S. with over 300 high-rises, 55 of which exceed 490 ft (149 m). The port of Miami is the busiest cruise port in the world in both passenger traffic and cruise lines, with over 5.5 million cruise passengers passing through the port each year. The center for tropical plant culture and research in the United States is based in Miami at [[Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden]], while the state of Florida is the number two producer of oranges in the world behind [[Brazil]].
