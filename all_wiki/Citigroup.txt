[[File:Travelers logo.png|thumb|The corporate logo of Travelers Inc. (1993â€“1998) prior to the merger with Citicorp.]]
Travelers Group, at the time of the merger, was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under CEO [[Sandy Weill]]. Its roots came from Commercial Credit, a subsidiary of [[Control Data Corporation]] that was taken private by Weill in November 1986 after taking charge of the company earlier that year.<ref name="IHT"/> Two years later, Weill mastered the buyout of [[Primerica Financial Services]]â€”a conglomerate that had already bought [[life insurance]] company A L Williams as well as [[brokerage firm]] [[Smith Barney]]. The new company took the Primerica name, and employed a "[[cross-selling]]" strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each other's services. Its non-financial businesses were [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]].

In September 1992, [[Travelers Insurance]], which had suffered from poor real estate investments<ref name="IHT"/> and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Andrew]],<ref>{{cite news | url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,158008,00.html | title=Survival Insurance | work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] | date=June 24, 2001}}</ref> formed a strategic alliance with Primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in December 1993. With the acquisition, the group became Travelers Inc. Property & casualty and life & annuities [[underwriting]] capabilities were added to the business. Meanwhile, the distinctive Travelers red umbrella logo, which was also acquired in the deal, was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization. During this period, Travelers acquired [[Shearson Lehman]]â€”a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by Weill until 1985<ref name="IHT"/>â€”and merged it with Smith Barney.

====Ownership of Salomon Brothers (1997â€“2003)====
In November 1997, Travelers Group (which had been renamed again in April 1995 when they merged with Aetna Property and Casualty, Inc.), acquired [[Salomon Brothers]], a major [[Bond market|bond dealer]] and [[bulge bracket]] [[investment bank]], in a $9 billion transaction.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2439/104746997006335/filing-main.htm | title=Travelers Group, Form 8-K, Current Report | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=November 28, 1997}}</ref> This deal complemented Travelers/[[Smith Barney]] well as Salomon was focused on fixed-income and institutional clients, whereas Smith Barney was strong in equities and retail. Salomon Brothers absorbed Smith Barney into the new securities unit termed Salomon Smith Barney; a year later, the division incorporated Citicorp's former securities operations as well. The Salomon Smith Barney name was abandoned in October 2003 after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the bank's reputation.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-slow-death-of-smith-barney-2012-6 | title=Morgan Stanley Is Killing 'Smith Barney' â€” Here's The Story Of How It Died | first=Ben | last=Duronio | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=June 12, 2012}}</ref>

===Merger of Citicorp and Travelers (1998â€“2001)===
On April 6, 1998, the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group was announced to the world, creating a $140 billion firm with assets of almost $700 billion.<ref name="IHT"/> The deal would enable Travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to Citicorp's retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers.

In the transaction, Travelers Group acquired all Citicorp shares for $70 billion in stock, issuing 2.5 new Citigroup shares for each Citicorp share. Existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm.<ref name="IHT"/> While the new company maintained Citicorp's "Citi" brand in its name, it adopted Travelers' distinctive "red umbrella" as the new corporate logo, which was used until 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/02/13/news/companies/citigroup/ | title=Travelers buys back its red umbrella | first=Keisha | last=Lamothe | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=February 13, 2007}}</ref>

The chairmen of both parent companies, [[John S. Reed]] and [[Sandy Weill]] respectively, were announced as co-chairmen and co-CEOs of the new company, Citigroup, Inc., although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup.

The remaining provisions of the [[Glassâ€“Steagall Act]]â€”enacted following the Great Depressionâ€”forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters, and meant Citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets. However, Weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed "that over that time the legislation will change...we have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem".<ref name="IHT"/> Indeed, the passing of the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] in November 1999 vindicated Reed and Weill's views, opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking, investment banking, insurance underwriting, and brokerage.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/071603.asp | title=What Was The Glassâ€“Steagall Act? | first=Reem | last=Heakal | publisher=[[Investopedia]] | date=July 16, 2003}}</ref>

[[Joe J. Plumeri]] worked on the post-merger integration of the two companies and was appointed CEO of Citibank North America by Weill and Reed. He oversaw its network of 450 [[branch (banking)|branches]].<ref name=plumeriwsj>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB944183809998441272 | title=Joseph Plumeri to Leave Citigroup For Top Job at Nonfinancial Firm | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=December 3, 1999}}{{subscription required}}</ref> J.

===Spin-off of Travelers (2002)===
[[File:The Travelers Companies.svg|thumb|The current logo for Travelers Companies]]
The company spun off its Travelers Property and Casualty insurance underwriting business in 2002.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2826/91205702027805/filing-main.htm | title=Citigroup, Form 8-K, Current Report | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=July 18, 2002}}</ref> The spin-off was prompted by the insurance unit's drag on Citigroup stock price because Travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters and events such as the [[September 11 attacks]]. It was also difficult to sell insurance directly to its customers since most customers were accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/12/19/ipo/citigroup/index.htm | title=Citigroup to spin Travelers | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=December 19, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/20/business/fi-16570 | title=Citigroup to Spin Off Travelers Insurance | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=December 20, 2001}}</ref>

Travelers merged with The St. Paul Companies Inc. in 2004 forming The St. Paul Travelers Companies.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20040401005410/en/St.-Paul-Travelers-Merger-Complete | title=St. Paul Travelers Merger Complete | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=April 1, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/2809/0001104659-04-011724.pdf | title=Travelers Group, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date  | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=April 29, 2004}}</ref> Citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business; however, it sold those businesses to [[MetLife]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1668/95012305000892/filing-main.htm | title=Citigroup, Form 8-K, Current Report | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=January 31, 2005}}</ref> Citigroup still sells life insurance through Citibank, but it no longer underwrites insurance.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://online.citi.com/US/JRS/pands/detail.do?ID=Insurance | title= Citibank: Insurance | publisher=Citibank}}</ref>

In spite of divesting Travelers Insurance, Citigroup retained Travelers' signature red umbrella logo as its own until February 2007, when Citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to St. Paul Travelers,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/2935/0001047469-08-011506.pdf | title=Citigroup, Form 10-Q, Quarterly Report | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=October 31, 2008}}</ref> which renamed itself [[Travelers Companies]]. Citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand "Citi" for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries, except Primerica and Banamex.

===Subprime mortgage crisis (2007)===
Heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of [[collateralized debt obligation]] (CDOs), compounded by poor risk management, led Citigroup into trouble as the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] worsened in 2007. The company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas, but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages. Trading head [[Thomas Maheras]] was close friends with senior risk officer David Bushnell, which undermined risk oversight.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/business/yourmoney/27kim.html | title=What's $34 billion on Wall Street? | first=Landon Jr. | last=Thomas | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/business/23citi.html | title=Citigroup Saw No Red Flags Even as It Made Bolder Bets | first1=Eric | last1=Dash | first2=Julie | last2=Creswell | work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 23, 2008}}</ref> As Treasury Secretary, [[Robert Rubin]] was said to be influential in lifting the [[Glassâ€“Steagall Act]] that allowed Travelers and Citicorp to merge in 1998. Then on the board of directors of Citigroup, Rubin and Charles Prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards [[Mortgage-backed security|MBS]] and CDOs in the subprime mortgage market.

Starting in June 2006, Senior Vice President [[Richard M. Bowen III]], the chief underwriter of Citigroup's Consumer Lending Group, began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses. The group bought and sold $90 billion of residential mortgages annually. Bowen's responsibility was essential to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit's creditworthiness. When Bowen first became a [[whistleblower]] in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. The number of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective but were a result of [[mortgage fraud]]. Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications. On November 3, 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup Chairman [[Robert Rubin]] and the bank's [[chief financial officer]], head auditor, and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses, claiming that the group's internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit. The subsequent investigation revealed that the Consumer Lending Group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since 2005. Despite the findings of the investigation, Bowen's charges were ignored, even though withholding such information from shareholders violated the [[Sarbanesâ€“Oxley Act]] (SOX), which he had pointed out. Citigroup CEO [[Charles Prince]] signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with SOX despite Bowen revealing this wasn't so. Citigroup eventually stripped Bowen of most of his responsibilities and informed him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked him to testify about Citigroup's role in the mortgage crisis, and he did so, appearing as one of the first witnesses before the Commission in April 2010.<ref name="Prosecuting Wall Street">{{cite news|title=Prosecuting Wall Street|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57336042/prosecuting-wall-street/|publisher=CBS News: 60 Minutes|accessdate=September 23, 2013|date=December 5, 2011}}</ref>

As the crisis began to unfold, Citigroup announced on April 11, 2007, that it would eliminate 17,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of its workforce, in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1759/110465907027668/filing-main.htm | title=Citigroup, Form 8-K, Current Report | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=April 11, 2007}}</ref> Even after [[Security (finance)|securities]] and [[brokerage]] firm [[Bear Stearns]] ran into serious trouble in summer 2007, Citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its CDOs was so tiny (less than 1/100 of 1%) that they excluded them from their risk analysis. With the crisis worsening, Citigroup announced on January 7, 2008 that it was considering cutting another 5 percent to 10 percent of its 327,000 member-workforce.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSN0738522020080107 |title=Citi mulls cutting work force by 5 to 10 percent: report |last=Plumb|first=Christian|date=January 1, 2008|agency=Reuters|accessdate=August 7, 2008}}</ref><ref name="jobcuts1">{{cite news|url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/04/11/businesspro-citigroup-dc-idUKWEN630720070412 |title=Citigroup to slash 17,000 jobs|last1=Stempel|first1=Jonathan|first2=Dan|last2=Wilchins|date=April 12, 2007|agency=Reuters|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref>

===Collapse and US government intervention (2008)===
By November 2008, Citigroup was insolvent, despite its receipt of $25 billion in taxpayer-funded federal [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] funds. On November 17, 2008, Citigroup announced plans for about 52,000 new job cuts, on top of 23,000 cuts already made during 2008 in a huge job cull resulting from four quarters of consecutive losses and reports that it was unlikely to be in profit again before 2010. The same day on [[Wall Street]] markets responded, with shares falling and dropping the company's market capitalization to $6 billion, down from $300 billion two years prior.<ref name=stockcollapse/> Eventually staff cuts totaled over 100,000 employees.<ref name=jobcuts2>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7733575.stm|title=Citigroup job cull to hit 75,000|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=November 17, 2008|date=November 17, 2008}}</ref> Its stock market value dropped to $20.5 billion, down from $244&nbsp;billion two years earlier.<ref name=stockcollapse>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/business/23citi.html|title=Citigroup Saw No Red Flags Even as It Made Bolder Bets |last1=Dash |first1=Eric |last2=Creswell|first2=Julie|date=November 22, 2008 |accessdate=November 23, 2008 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> Shares of Citigroup common stock traded well below $1.00 on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].

As a result, late in the evening on November 23, 2008, Citigroup and Federal regulators approved a plan to stabilize the company and forestall a further deterioration in the company's value. On November 24, 2008, the U.S. government announced a massive bailout for Citigroup designed to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major say in its operations. A joint statement by the [[US Treasury Department]], the [[Federal Reserve]] and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corp]] announced: "With these transactions, the U.S. government is taking the actions necessary to strengthen the financial system and protect U.S. taxpayers and the U.S. economy."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122747680752551447 | title=U.S. Agrees to Rescue Struggling Citigroup | first1=David | last1=Enrich | first2=Carrick | last2=Mollenkamp | first3=Matthias |last3=Rieker | first4=Damian | last4=Paletta | first5=Jon | last5=Hilsenrath | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=November 24, 2008}}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20081123a.htm | title=FRB: Press Release-Joint statement by Treasury, Federal Reserve, and the FDIC on Citigroup | publisher=[[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]] | date=November 23, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/11/23/news/companies/citigroup/index.htm | title=Citi dodges bullet | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=November 23, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-citigroup/citigroup-gets-massive-government-bailout-idUSTRE4AJ45G20081124 | title=Citigroup gets massive government bailout | first1=Dan | last1=Wilchins | first2=Jonathan | last2=Stempel | work=[[Reuters]] | date=November 23, 2008}}</ref> The bailout called for the government to back about $306 billion in loans and securities and directly invest about $20 billion in the company. The Treasury provided $20 billion in [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) funds in addition to $25 billion given in October. The Treasury Department, the [[Federal Reserve]] and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) agreed to cover 90% of the losses on Citigroup's $335 billion portfolio after Citigroup absorbed the first $29 billion in losses. The Treasury would assume the first $5 billion in losses; the FDIC would absorb the next $10&nbsp;billion; then the Federal Reserve would assume the rest of the risk. The assets remained on Citigroup's balance sheet; the technical term for this arrangement is [[Ring fence|ring fencing]].

In return, the bank gave the U.S. Treasury $27 billion of preferred shares and warrants to acquire [[common stock]]. The government obtained wide powers over banking operations. Citigroup agreed to try to modify mortgages, using standards set up by the FDIC after the collapse of [[IndyMac Bank]], with the goal of keeping as many homeowners as possible in their houses. Executive salaries would be capped.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/24/business/24citibank.html |title=U.S. Approves Plan to Help Citigroup Weather Losses | last=Dash | first=Eric | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 23, 2008}}</ref> As a condition of the federal assistance, Citigroup's dividend payment was reduced to $0.01 per share.

According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', the government aid provided to Citi in 2008/2009 was provided to prevent a worldwide chaos and panic by the potential collapse of its Global Transactions Services (now TTS) division. According to the article, former CEO Pandit said if Citigroup was allowed to unravel into bankruptcy, "100 governments around the world would be trying to figure out how to pay their employees".<ref>{{cite news | last=Enrich | first=David | url=http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB126317001431624045 | title=Citi Unit Grows -- With Feds' Help | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=January 12, 2010}}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Ovide | first=Shira | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2010/11/29/the-overlooked-gem-inside-citigroup/ | title=The Overlooked Gem Inside Citigroup | publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=November 29, 2010}}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2008/11/25/the-true-lessons-of-citis-collapse/|title=The True Lessons Of Citi's Collapse|last=Gelinas|first=Nicole|date=November 25, 2008|work=[[New York Post]]|access-date=March 20, 2018}}</ref>

===Creation of Citi Holdings (2009)===
On January 16, 2009, Citigroup announced its intention to reorganize itself into two operating units: Citicorp for its retail and institutional client business, and Citi Holdings for its brokerage and asset management.<ref name=prsplit>{{cite press release | url=http://www.citigroup.com/citi/news/2009/090116b.htm | title=Citi to Reorganize into Two Operating Units to Maximize Value of Core Franchise | publisher=Citigroup | date=January 16, 2009}}</ref> Citigroup will continue to operate as a single company for the time being, but Citi Holdings managers will be tasked to "take advantage of value-enhancing disposition and combination opportunities as they emerge",<ref name=prsplit/> and eventual spin-offs or mergers involving either operating unit were not ruled out.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/business/17citi.html | title=Citigroup Reports Big Loss and a Breakup Plan | first=Eric | last=Dash | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 17, 2009}}</ref> Citi Holdings consists of Citi businesses that Citi wants to sell and are not considered part of Citi's core businesses. The majority of its assets are U.S. mortgages. It was created in the wake of the financial crisis as part of Citi's restructuring plan. It consists of several business entities including remaining interests in local consumer lending such as OneMain Financial, divestitures such as Smith Barney, and a special asset pool. Citi Holdings represents $156 billion of GAAP assets, or ~8% of Citigroup; 59% represents North American mortgages, 18% operating businesses, 13% special asset pool, and 10% categorized as other.

The company will have four months to make a new plan and submit it to the Federal Reserve.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/84c831fb-5088-41cd-bcb6-0f0daf968c43|title= Citigroup fined $400m over internal controls 'deficiencies'|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=8 October 2020|author=Robert Armstrong|accessdate=8 October 2020}}</ref>

===New York City===
[[Citigroup Center]], a diagonal-roof skyscraper located in [[Midtown Manhattan]], New York City, is Citigroup's most famous office building, which despite popular belief is not the company's headquarters building. Citigroup has its headquarters located in downtown Tribeca (388 Greenwich).<ref>{{cite web | title=In $1B deal, Citi moves HQ downtown | url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20131219/REAL_ESTATE/131219836/in-1b-deal-citi-moves-hq-downtown | first=Daniel | last=Geiger | work=[[Crain Communications]] | date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> Citigroup also owns a building in [[Tribeca, Manhattan]] at [[388 Greenwich Street]] that serves as headquarters for its Investment and Corporate Banking operations and was the former headquarters of the Travelers Group.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://therealdeal.com/2016/06/13/citigroup-closes-on-1-8b-repurchase-of-tribeca-hq-from-sl-green/ | title=Citigroup closes on $1.8B buy of Tribeca HQ from SL Green | first=Konrad | last=Putzier | work=[[The Real Deal (magazine)|The Real Deal]] | date=June 13, 2016}}</ref>

All of Citigroup's New York City real estate, excluding the company's Smith Barney division and Wall Street trading division, lies along the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]], served by the {{NYCS trains|Queens 53rd}}. Consequently, the company's Midtown buildingsâ€”including 787 Seventh Avenue, 666 Fifth Avenue, 399 Park Avenue, 485 Lexington, 153 East 53rd Street (Citigroup Center) in Manhattan, and [[One Court Square]] in [[Long Island City]], [[Queens]], are all on the short four-stop corridor of the Queens Boulevard Line between [[Court Square (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Court Square]] and [[Seventh Avenue (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Seventh Avenue]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.mta.info/maps/submap.html |title=mta.info &#124; MTA Subway Map | publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]}}</ref>

==Regulatory action, lawsuits, and arbitration==
In 2004, Japanese regulators took action against Citibank Japan loaning to a customer involved in stock manipulation. The regulator suspended bank activities in one branch and three offices and restricted their consumer banking division.

The regulators suspended sales operations within Citibank's retail banking for a month.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/japanese-regulators-suspend-citibank-retail-ads/ | title=Japan Slaps Sanctions on Citibank | first=Chris | last=Nicholson | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 26, 2009}}</ref>

In 2014, Citigroup agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve claims it misled investors about shoddy mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said "The bankâ€™s misconduct was egregious. [...] As a result of their assurances that toxic financial products were sound, Citigroup was able to expand its market share and increase profits" and that "the settlement did not absolve the bank or its employees from facing criminal charges."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/citigroup-and-u-s-reach-7-billion-mortgage-settlement/?_php=true&_type=blogs&ref=todayspaper&_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Corkery | title=Citigroup Settles Mortgage Inquiry for $7 Billion | date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>

==Criticism==

===Alleged money laundering by Raul Salinas===
In 1998, the [[General Accounting Office]] issued a report critical of Citibank's handling of funds received from [[Raul Salinas de Gortari]], brother of [[Carlos Salinas]], the former president of Mexico. The report, titled "Raul Salinas, Citibank and Alleged Money Laundering," indicated that Citibank facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars through complex financial transactions that hid the funds' paper trail. The report indicated that Citibank took on Salinas as a client without making a thorough inquiry as to how he made his fortune, an omission that a Citibank official called a violation of the bank's "know your customer" policy.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/mexico/stories/981204.htm | title=Citibank Called Lax on Salinas Money Trail | first=Kathleen | last=Day | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=December 4, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB846798978902024000 | title=How Citicorp's Amy Elliott Served Mexico's Raul Salinas | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=November 1, 1996}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

===Citigroup proprietary government bond trading scandal of 2004===
Citigroup was criticized for disrupting the European [[bond market]] by rapidly selling â‚¬11&nbsp;billion worth of bonds on August 2, 2004, on the MTS Group trading platform, driving down the price and then buying it back at cheaper prices.<ref>{{cite news |title=Citigroup embroiled in bond selling scandal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/feb/01/money1 |accessdate=August 2, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 1, 2005}}</ref>

===Plutonomy report===
In a leaked report for their investor clients from 2005, a team of global strategists at Citigroup wrote an analysis of the global distribution of income and wealth and what the implications for investment are. In the report, they state that rising global imbalances have transformed advanced Anglo-American economies into [[plutonomy|plutonomies]], in which economic growth is both powered by and consumed by the wealthy. The authors cite data showing that the top 1% of households in the US economy account for about 20% of the total income in 2000, which is roughly equal to the share of the bottom 60% of households put together. Moreover, in terms of wealth, they demonstrate even more inequality such that "[T]he top 1% of households also account for 33% of net worth, greater than the bottom 90% of households put together. It gets better (or worse, depending on your political stripe) - the top 1% of households account for 40% of financial net worth, more than the bottom 95% of households put together."<ref name=kms2005>Ajay Kapur, Niall Macleod, and Narendra Singh (2005): "Plutonomy: Buying Luxury, Explaining Global Imbalances."</ref>{{rp|3}}
As regards the current plutonomies (namely [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]]), they put forward six key drivers for plutonomy: "...an ongoing [bio-]technological revolution; capitalist-friendly governments and tax regimes; globalization that re-arranges global supply chains with mobile well-capitalized elites and immigrants; greater financial complexity and innovation; the rule of law, and patent protection are all well."<ref name=kms2005/>{{rp|9}} Next, the authors show that in industrialized countries, plutonomy has led to a relationship between income concentration (plutonomy) and the household savings rates such that the latter tend to fall in plutonomies because of the spending thrift of the wealthy.<ref name=kms2005/>{{rp|18}} In view of the fact "...the rich have been getting progressively richer over the last 30 years, saving less and spending more, the fortunes of companies that sell to the rich ought to have been good."<ref name=kms2005/>{{rp|26}} Hence, the authors urge their investors to invest in equities of companies that cater to the wealthy (i.e. luxury industry).

===TARP funding===
In a ''The New York Times'' op-ed, Michael Lewis and David Einhorn described the November 2008 $306 billion guarantee as "an undisguised gift" without any real crisis motivating it.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/opinion/04lewiseinhornb.html | title=How to Repair a Broken Financial World | authorlink1=Michael Lewis | authorlink2=David Einhorn (hedge fund manager) | first1=Michael | last1=Lewis | first2=David | last2=Einhorn | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 4, 2009}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

According to New York Attorney General [[Andrew Cuomo]], Citigroup paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses to more than 1,038 of its employees after it had received its $45 billion TARP funds in late 2008. This included 738 employees each receiving $1 million in bonuses, 176 employees each receiving $2 million bonuses, 124 each receiving $3 million in bonuses, and 143 each receiving bonuses of $4 million to more than $10 million.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/07/30/wall-street-compensation-no-clear-rhyme-or-reason/tab/print/ | title=Wall Street Compensationâ€“'No Clear Rhyme or Reason | first=Stephen | last=Grocer | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=July 30, 2009}}{{subscription required}}</ref> As a result of the criticism and the U.S. Government's majority holding of Citigroup's [[common stock]], compensation and bonuses were restricted from February 2009 until December 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sigtarp.gov/Audit%20Reports/SIGTARP_ExecComp_Audit.pdf | title=The Special Master's Determinations for Executive Compensation of Companies Receiving Exceptional Assistance Under TARP | publisher=[[SIGTARP]] | date=January 23, 2012}}</ref>

===Terra Securities scandal===
In November 2007 it became public that Citigroup was heavily involved in the [[Terra Securities scandal]], which involved investments by eight municipalities of Norway in various hedge funds in the United States bond market.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/europe/02norway.html | title=U.S. Credit Crisis Adds to Gloom in Norway | last=Landler | first=Mark | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 2, 2007}}{{subscription required}}</ref> The funds were sold by [[Terra Securities]] to the municipalities, while the products were delivered by Citigroup. Terra Securities ASA filed for bankruptcy on November 28, 2007, the day after they received a letter from the [[Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway]] announcing the withdrawal of permissions to operate. The letter stated, "The Supervisory Authority contends that Citigroup's presentation, as well as the presentation from Terra Securities ASA, appears insufficient and misleading because central elements like information about potential extra payments and the size of these are omitted."<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amDlDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT55 | title=Redesigning the Stock Market: A Fractal Approach | first=Pravir  | last=Malik | publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] | date=November 8, 2011| isbn=9788132119326 }}</ref>

===Allegations of theft from customer accounts===
In August 2008, Citigroup agreed to pay nearly $18 million in refunds and fines to settle accusations by California Attorney General [[Jerry Brown]] that it wrongly took funds from the accounts of credit card customers. Citigroup paid $14 million of restitution to roughly 53,000 customers nationwide. A three-year investigation found that Citigroup from 1992 to 2003 used an improper computerized "sweep" feature to move positive balances from card accounts into the bank's general fund, without telling cardholders.<ref name=theft>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/sppage012-n26369737-oisbn-idUSN2636973720080826 | title=Citigroup to pay $18 mln over credit card practice | first=Jonathan | last=Stempel | work=[[Reuters]] | date=August 26, 2008}}</ref> Brown said that Citigroup "knowingly stole from its customers, mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweeps...When a whistleblower uncovered the scam and brought it to his superiors [in 2001], they buried the information and continued the illegal practice."<ref name=theft/>

===Potential restructuring and liquidation by regulators===
In September 2011, former Wall Street reporter [[Ron Suskind]] stated that Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] ignored a 2009 order from President [[Barack Obama]] to break up Citigroup in an enormous restructuring and [[liquidation]] process.<ref name=suskind>{{cite book|title=''Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington and the Education of a President'' | author=Ron Susskind | date= September 2011| title-link=Confidence Men }}</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2014}} According to Suskind, Obama wanted to restructure the bank into several leaner and smaller companies while Geithner was executing stress tests of American financial institutions.

[[Robert Kuttner]] wrote in his 2010 book ''A Presidency in Peril'' that in spring 2009, Geithner and chief economic adviser Larry Summers believed that they could not seize, liquidate and break up Citigroup because they lacked the legal authority or the tools to do so. The Treasury Department denied Suskind's account in an e-mail to the media stating "This account is simply untrue. The directive given by the president in March 2009, was to develop a contingency plan for tough restructurings if the government ended up owning large shares of institutions at the conclusion of the stress tests that Secretary Geithner worked aggressively to put in place as part of the Administration's Financial Stability Plan. While Treasury began work on those contingency plans, there was fortunately never a need to put them in place."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110916/FREE/110919918 | title=Geithner ignored Obama order on Citi, book says | agency=[[Bloomberg News]] | publisher=[[Crain Communications]] | date=September 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obama-geithner-and-the-ne_b_1002611 | title=Obama, Geithner and the Next Financial Crisis | first=Robert | last=Kuttner | author-link=Robert Kuttner | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=October 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyinperi00robe | url-access=registration | title=A Presidency in Peril | first=Robert | last=Kuttner | author-link=Robert Kuttner | publisher=[[Chelsea Green Publishing]] | year=2010| isbn=9781603582704 }}</ref>

===Shareholder rejection of executive compensation plan===
At Citi's 2012 annual shareholders' meeting on April 17, Citi's executive compensation package was rejected, with approximately 55% of the votes being against approval. The non-binding vote was required under the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires corporations to hold advisory shareholder votes on their executive compensation plans. Many shareholders expressed concerns about Citi's failed 2012 Fed stress test and lack of long-term performance-based metrics in its executive compensation plan. One of the largest and most activist of the shareholders voting no, the [[California Public Employees' Retirement System]], stated Citi "has not anchored rewards to performance".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/18/business/la-fi-exec-pay-20120419y | title=Citigroup shareholders' vote on exec pay sends a message | first=E.

===Accusations of futures market manipulation===
In January 2017, bank regulators fined Citigroup $25 million on account of five traders from the bank having manipulated U.S. Treasury futures more than 2,500 times between July 2011 and December 2012. Citigroup was criticized for failing to adequately supervise its traders and for not having systems in place to detect spoofing, which involves entering fake orders designed to fool others into thinking prices are poised to rise or fall.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-19/citigroup-agrees-to-pay-25-million-over-spoofing-allegations | last=Leising | first=Matthew | title=Citigroup Punished for Treasury Market Spoofing by Five Traders| work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=January 19, 2017}}</ref>

=== Failure to match paternity and maternity leave ===
Although Citi offers paternity leave, it does not make it mandatory nor does it offer equal leave to all employees. Citi touted its big increase of its paternity leave in 2020 when it raised it to 4 weeks in Singapore. They claimed it would drive greater gender equality.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Seow|first=Joanna|date=2020-03-12|title=Citi S'pore extends paternity leave to 4 weeks|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/citi-spore-extends-paternity-leave-to-4-weeks|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-09|website=The Straits Times|language=en}}</ref> This compares with the New York Times, which offer a minimum 10 weeks paternity leave for its American staff.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Popper|first=Nathaniel|date=2020-04-17|title=Paternity Leave Has Long-Lasting Benefits.

===Lobbying===
Between 1998 and 2014, Citigroup spent nearly $100 million lobbying the federal government.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000071 | title=Citigroup Lobbying | publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]]}}</ref> As of 2008, Citigroup was the 16th largest political campaign contributor in the US, out of all organizations, according to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]]. From 1989 to 2006, members of the firm donated over $23,033,490, 49% of which went to Democrats and 51% of which went to Republicans.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?ID=D000000071&Name=Citigroup+Inc | title=Citigroup Inc: Summary | publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]]}}</ref>
Matthew Vadum, a senior editor at the conservative [[Capital Research Center]], acknowledged these figures, but pointed out that Citigroup had been "a longtime donor to left-wing pressure groups", and referred to a Capital Research Center Foundation Watch 2006 study of Fortune 100 foundation giving, where Citigroup's foundation gave "20 times more money to groups on the left than to groups on the right" during the tax year 2003.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://spectator.org/articles/42567/liberalism-never-sleeps | title=Liberalism Never Sleeps | first=Matthew | last=Vadum | work=[[The American Spectator]] | date=November 25, 2008 | access-date=December 20, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220041531/http://spectator.org/articles/42567/liberalism-never-sleeps | archive-date=December 20, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2014 Citigroup's PAC contributed $804,000 to campaigns of various members of Congress, i.e. 162 members of the House, including 72 Democrats, where donations averaged about $5,000 per candidate. Of the 57 Democrats supporting the 2015 Spending bill, 34 had received campaign cash from Citigroup's PAC at some point since 2010.<ref name=crp>{{cite web | first=Russ | last=Choma | title=Wall Street's Omnibus Triumph, and Others | url=http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2014/12/wall-streets-omnibus-triumph-and-others/ | publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]] | date=December 12, 2014}}</ref> Citigroup's 2014 donations favored Republicans only slightly. The bank's PAC had been nearly as generous to Democrats as Republicans&nbsp;â€“ $30,000 to the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (the maximum) and $10,000 to the 'New Democrat Coalition', a group of moderate Democrats most of whom voted for the 2015 spending package. Citibank's PAC made donations to both the campaigns and the leadership PACs of many top Democrats who voted for the 2015 spending bill, including [[Steny Hoyer]] (Md.) [[House Democratic Whip]] and Representatives [[Jim Himes]] (D-Conn.) and [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] (D-Florida.).<ref name=crp/>

=== Public and governmental relations ===
In 2009, former chairman Richard Parsons hired long-time Washington, D.C. lobbyist [[Richard F. Hohlt]] to advise him and the company about relations with the U.S. government, though not to lobby for the company. While some speculated anonymously that the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) would have been a particular focus of Hohlt's attention, Hohlt said he'd had no contact with the government insurance corporation. Some former regulators found room to criticize Hohlt's involvement with Citigroup, because of his earlier involvement with the financial services industry during the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the 1980s. Hohlt responded that though mistakes were made in the earlier episode he'd never been investigated by any government agency and his experience gave him a reason to be back in the "operating room" as parties address the more recent crisis.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/business/11hohlt.html|title=Citigroup Hires Mr. Inside | authorlink1=Gretchen Morgenson | first1=Gretchen | last1=Morgenson | first2=Andrew | last2=Martin | work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 10, 2009}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

On 21 March 2018, it was announced that Citigroup changed its policy to forbid its business customers from performing certain firearm-related transactions.
