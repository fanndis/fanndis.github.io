==Career==

===Early career===
Interested in life beyond Los Angeles, Scott Borchetta began to pursue his love for music. After playing in several rock bands, he left California and moved to Nashville with his father. There, Borchetta played bass in a country band and spent his days working in his father's mail room promoting country singles. After 8 months on the road, he left his band since they were not finding success. While working with his father, Borchetta learned a great deal about the [[music industry]] and how it operates, and used this knowledge to pursue jobs at record labels. In 1985, he got a job at MTM Records, where he stayed for three years. He then spent two years working as an independent promoter before working in promotion and artist development at several other record labels, including [[MCA Nashville Records]], [[DreamWorks Nashville]] and [[Universal Music Nashville]].<ref name=NYTIMES />

===Big Machine Label Group===
{{Main| Big Machine Records}}
In 2005, Borchetta made the decision to leave [[Universal Music Group Nashville|Universal Music Nashville]] to start his own independent record label, [[Big Machine Records]]. From his experiences with working at several record labels,<ref>Music Exec. "enamored" by 14-year-old Taylor Swift http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50143840n Retrieved 29 March 2013</ref> Borchetta realized that he disagreed with how major labels run their business, and felt that he and his friend Neil Adams could run his own label more efficiently than what he had seen.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Soon after starting the label, Borchetta signed his first artist, singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] (whom he had met in 2004) when she was 14 years old. Swift would eventually go on to become Big Machine's most successful artist and win the label two [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] for the albums ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' at the [[2010 Grammy Awards]] and ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' at the [[2016 Grammy Awards]].

On June 30, 2019, Ithaca Holdings, run by [[Scooter Braun]], bought [[Big Machine Records]], with Borchetta staying on as CEO. This transaction included the masters of [[Taylor Swift|Taylor Swift's]] first six albums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/7/1/20677241/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-controversy-explained|title=The Taylor Swift/Scooter Braun controversy, explained|last=Grady|first=Constance|date=2019-07-01|website=Vox|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Swift voiced her frustrations in a [[Tumblr]] post, claiming to have been trying to buy the masters for years and described Braun as an “incessant, manipulative bully”.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://taylorswift.tumblr.com/post/185958366550/for-years-i-asked-pleaded-for-a-chance-to-own-my|title=Taylor Swift|website=Taylor Swift|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Swift also claimed Borchetta's loyalty was only through contracts, and that he knew “exactly what he was doing” when making this deal with Ithaca Holdings.<ref name=":0" /> Swift expressed that these men were “controlling a woman who did not want to be associated with them”.<ref name=":0" /> The dispute escalated throughout the year, both parties claiming to be owed millions of dollars from the other.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/big-machine-taylor-swift-ama-netflix-controversy-913176/|title=Big Machine, Taylor Swift Camp Spar Over American Music Awards, Netflix Controversy|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=2019-11-15|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Swift accused Braun and Borchetta of holding her back from being able to perform her older songs during her [[American Music Awards]] for her Artist of the Decade award, as well as for her [[Netflix]] documentary, ''[[Miss Americana]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8543706/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-scott-borchetta-perform-old-music-amas|title=Taylor Swift Says Scooter Braun & Scott Borchetta Won't Let Her Perform Her Old Songs at 2019 AMAs|date=2019-11-14|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> On the same day Swift posted on her [[Tumblr]] account, Borchetta went on Big Machine Records and posted his own statement. He claimed to have given Swift a heads up through text the night before. “Out of courtesy, I personally texted Taylor at 9:06pm, Saturday, June 29th to inform her prior to the story breaking on the morning of Sunday, June 30th so she could hear it directly from me.”<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bigmachinelabelgroup.com/news/so-its-time-some-truth|title=So, It’s Time For Some Truth…|date=2019-06-30|website=Big Machine Label Group|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> He continued on to say “Taylor and I remained on very good terms when she told me she wanted to speak with other record companies and see what was out there for her.  I never got in her way and wished her well.”<ref name=":1" /> He also mentioned she had the opportunity to own not just her recordings, but everything else. “Taylor had every chance in the world to own not just her master recordings, but every video, photograph, everything associated to her career. She chose to leave.”<ref name=":1" />
