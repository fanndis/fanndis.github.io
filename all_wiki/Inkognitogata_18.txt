== Residences of the Prime Minister ==
Norway has had several residences for its state leader through the years but did not have an official residence for the Prime Minister until the current residence was completed. Parkveien 45 is considered first and original Prime Ministers residence in Norway while [[Arne Korsmo|Arne Konsmos' Villa Stenersen in Tuengen allé 10c]] also served as the Prime Minister's residence for some time. The last prime minister to have lived in an residence prior to the completion of Inkognitogata 18 was [[Odvar Nordli]], who lived in Villa Stenersen, but he moved out before his term ended and turned the residence over to [[Minister of Trade and Shipping (Norway)|Minister of Trade]] [[Hallvard Bakke]]. Nordli believed that Bakke, who lived in a small apartment with his wife and two children, needed the space more than Nordli and his wife did.  

In 2004, Prime Minister [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]] proposed that a proper residence be constructed for both practical and safety reasons. These plans were followed and [[Jens Stoltenberg]] became the first prime minister to reside in the building when the expansion and restoration was completed in 2008.

== Prime ministers who have resided in Inkognitogata 18 ==

* Jens Stoltenberg (2008-2013)
* [[Erna Solberg]] (2013-present)

==Individual buildings==
===Parkveien 45===
Parkveien 45 used to be the official residence of the [[Prime Minister of Norway]], but had not been used as such for many years. 

The house in Parkveien 45 was originally built as a private residence for Fredrik Sundt, a businessman importing [[Mineral oil|paraffin oil]], hence the popular name of the house 'Villa Parafina'. The villa was purchased by the Norwegian government in 1896. From 1898 to 1908 it was used as the residence for the Prime Minister of Norway, housing [[Francis Hagerup]], [[Johannes Steen]], [[Otto Blehr]], [[Christian Michelsen]] and [[Jørgen Løvland]] in succession. From 1908 the house was the residence of the Foreign minister until 1961 when it became the government representation house. The house is important in the history of [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|Norway's independence negotiations]] with [[Sweden]] in 1905.<ref>[http://statsbygg.no/prosjekter/prosjektkatalog/584_parkveien/html/infotekst/historikk.html History of Parkveien 45] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716021300/http://statsbygg.no/prosjekter/prosjektkatalog/584_parkveien/html/infotekst/historikk.html |date=2011-07-16 }} (Norwegian)</ref>
