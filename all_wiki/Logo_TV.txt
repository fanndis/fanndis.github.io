'''Logo TV''' (often shortened to '''Logo''', and stylized as '''Logo.''') is an American [[basic cable]] [[cable channel|channel]] owned by [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]], a division of [[ViacomCBS]]. Launched in 2005, Logo was originally dedicated to lifestyle and entertainment programming targeting [[LGBT]] audiences. As of January 2016, approximately 50 million households receive Logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590 |title=Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: January 2016}}</ref>

==History==
The channel launched June 30, 2005 as the first advertiser-supported commercial television channel in the United States geared towards the [[gay]] community. It was founded by former [[MTV]] executive Matt Farber. Its first president, [[Brian Graden]], was named by ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' as the 15th most powerful gay person in America in 2007.<ref name=out>{{cite web| title='Out' Magazine Releases Power List, Underestimates 'Times' Gaiety| url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2008/04/out_magazine_releases_power_li.html| work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]| accessdate=2014-10-29| date=April 7, 2008}}</ref> Logo replaced [[VH1 MegaHits#VH1 MegaHits in the USA|VH1 MegaHits]] when it was launched.<ref name=Hibberd>{{cite news| last=Hibberd| first=James| title=Gay Net to Bump VH1 Spinoff| url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2005/05/gay_net_to_bump_vh1_spinoff.php| work=[[TelevisionWeek]]| accessdate=2014-10-29| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105355/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2005/05/gay_net_to_bump_vh1_spinoff.php| archive-date=2013-12-24| url-status=dead}}</ref>

The fact that the LGBT-themed channel was named "Logo" led some viewers to think the "l" and the "g" referenced "lesbian" and "gay", but according to company executives, the name does not represent anything, nor is it an [[acronym]].<ref name=launch>{{cite web| title=MTV To Launch Gay Lesbian Cable Network| publisher=Exoticize My Fist (defunct)| accessdate=2008-04-08| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316000121/http://www.exoticizemyfist.com/mtvlogo.htm | archivedate=March 16, 2008| url=http://www.exoticizemyfist.com/mtvlogo.htm}}</ref> The channel's website says:
{{quote|1=We chose the name "Logo TV" because a [[wikt:logo|logo]] is an identity and nothing's more important than having your own, unique identity, and making it work for you.

Logo struck carriage deals prior to its launch date with [[DirecTV]], [[Charter Communications]], [[Adelphia Communications Corporation]], [[Cablevision]], [[Time Warner Cable]], and [[RCN Corporation]]. The broadcaster reached a deal with [[Comcast]] after the launch date.<ref name=McDaniel>{{cite web| last=McDaniel| first=Mike| title=Today's Comcast changes add gay channel| url=https://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/Today-s-Comcast-changes-add-gay-channel-1821269.php| work=[[Houston Chronicle]]| accessdate=2014-10-29| date=June 19, 2007}}</ref> Logo has partnered with [[CBS News]] to provide news briefs and has developed a relationship with [[LPI Media]], publisher of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', ''Out'', and ''[[Out Traveler]]'' magazines.

In April 2011, Logo acquired the rights to air the British comedy series ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and co-produced the show's [[Absolutely Fabulous: 20th Anniversary|three revival specials]] during 2011 and 2012 with the [[BBC]] and [[BBC America]]. Logo aired the episodes in a heavily edited format, while BBC America aired the episodes in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web| title=Complete 'Absolutely Fabulous' to air on Logo TV| publisher=HitFix| accessdate=2014-10-29| url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/complete-absolutely-fabulous-to-air-on-logo-tv| date=March 24, 2011}}</ref>

==Programming==
{{Main|List of television programs broadcast by Logo}}
Logo's programming was initially a blend of movies, [[reality television]], travel programming, dating & romance shows, [[documentary film|documentaries]], [[music videos]], [[stand-up comedy]], news, and syndicated programs that either had queer characters or were popular among queer viewers.

Since 2017, the network's main programming serves as a complementary flank to [[TV Land]], airing older sitcoms from the 1970s to 1990s.<ref>http://www.logotv.com/tv-schedule</ref> In line with [[Viacom (2005–2019)|Viacom]]'s 2017 restructuring plan, the network no longer produces any new programming outside of content for its social media pages. ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'' moved to sister network [[VH1]] that year, with Logo now only airing reruns and simulcasts of the show and its spinoffs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/02/viacom-ceo-bob-bakish-supports-paramount-non-core-networks-how-long-1201906682/|title=Viacom CEO Supports Paramount And Non-Core Networks – But For How Long?|last=Lieberman|first=David|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=February 9, 2017|accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref>

Logo also previously operated a collection of websites under the LOGOonline umbrella name. NewNowNext, a pop culture news and trends blog, remains the only active website owned by the network.
