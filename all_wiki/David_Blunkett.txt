The editor of the conservative ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine, [[Fraser Nelson]], commented, "He was never under-briefed, and never showed any sign of his disability ... he was one of Labour's very best MPs – and one of the very few people in parliament whose life I would describe as inspirational."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=Fraser|title=The wit and wisdom of David Blunkett|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/06/the-wit-and-wisdom-of-david-blunkett/|access-date=21 June 2014|date=21 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705211443/http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/06/the-wit-and-wisdom-of-david-blunkett/|archive-date=5 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Responding to a question from Blunkett on 11 March 2015, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] said: "As a new backbencher, I will never forget coming to this place in 2001 and, in the light of the appalling terrorist attacks that had taken place across the world, seeing the strong leadership he gave on the importance of keeping our country safe.

==Early life==
David Blunkett was born on 6 June 1947 at [[Jessop Hospital]], [[Sheffield]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], with improperly developed [[optic nerve]]s due to a rare [[genetic disorder]].<ref name=ClearDay2002>Blunkett and MacCormick (2002). pp. 17–18.</ref> He grew up in an underprivileged family; in 1959 he endured a family tragedy when his father was gravely injured in an industrial accident: he fell into a vat of boiling water while at work as a foreman for the East Midlands Gas Board, dying a month later. This left the surviving family in poverty, especially since the board refused to pay compensation for two years because his father worked past the retirement age, dying at age 67.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/dec/16/schools.davidblunkett|newspaper=The Guardian Newspaper|date=16 December 2004|access-date=7 November 2018|title=The loner who beat all the odds ... until now|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108025824/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/dec/16/schools.davidblunkett|archive-date=8 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

By 1970, Blunkett was a [[Methodist local preacher]] based at Southey church in the Sheffield (North) circuit of the Methodist Connexion. He told the [[Methodist Recorder]] "My politics come directly from my religion. As a Christian I seen myself as a Socialist; not exactly a [[Donald Soper]], but that way inclined". At that point, he was engaged to Ruth Mitchell and they planned to marry in July.<ref>''50 years ago: Blind local preacher bids for city council place'', The Methodist Recorder, 13 March 2020.</ref>

In 1970, at the age of 22, Blunkett became the youngest-ever [[councillor]] on [[Sheffield City Council]] and in Britain,<ref name="Debrett's, 2011" /> being elected while a [[mature student]]. He served on Sheffield City Council from 1970 to 1988, and was Leader from 1980 to 1987. He also served on [[South Yorkshire County Council]] from 1973 to 1977. This was a time of decline for Sheffield's [[steel]] industry.

==Parliamentary career==
Having unsuccessfully fought [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]] in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]], at the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] he was elected [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Sheffield Brightside (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Brightside]] with a large majority in a safe Labour seat.

===Education and Employment Secretary===
After Labour's [[landslide victory]] in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], he became [[Secretary of State for Education and Employment]],<ref name="Brown,Colin_Mar05"/> thus becoming Britain's first blind cabinet minister ([[Henry Fawcett]], husband of suffragist [[Millicent Fawcett]], had been a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], of which the Cabinet is the executive committee, more than a century before). The role of Education Secretary was a vital one in a government whose [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] had in 1996 described his priorities as "education, education, education" and which had made reductions in school class sizes a pledge.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

As Secretary of State, Blunkett pursued conservative reforms, ready to take on the teaching unions and determined to ensure basic standards of literacy and numeracy. He was rewarded with extra funding to cut class sizes, and subsequently there has since 1997 been a massive increase in literacy and numeracy, and there are 42,000 more teachers than in 1997, with doubled spending per pupil in frontline{{clarify|date=February 2017}} schools (and over 100,000 teaching assistants) through to 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www4.labour.org.uk/policies/education |title=Education |access-date=17 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704195141/http://www.labour.org.uk/policies/education |archive-date=4 July 2010 |publisher=Labour Party}}</ref> A key pillar of Blunkett's work as Education Secretary was the introduction of [[Sure Start]], a government programme which provides services for pre-school children and their families. It works to bring together early education, childcare, health and family support. In 2011, the government effectively started the abolition of Sure Start by lifting the ring fence on earmarked funding and cutting back drastically on the funds available.

Blunkett also led the massive expansion in higher education.

===Home Secretary===
At the start of the Labour government's second term in 2001, Blunkett was promoted to [[Home Secretary]],<ref name="Brown,Colin_Mar05"/> fulfilling an ambition of his.

Blunkett was almost immediately faced with [[September 11 attacks]] on the USA. He brought in new anti-terrorism measures, including detention without trial of suspect foreign nationals who could not be extradited or deported. It caused a backbench rebellion and provoked strong opposition in the House of Lords, and Blunkett made concessions over incitement to religious hatred (later carried through by his successor) and to introduce a "sunset clause".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3337771.stm |title=Blunkett rebuts terror criticism |publisher=BBC News |date=21 December 2003 |access-date=4 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050924020459/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3337771.stm |archive-date=24 September 2005 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4100481.stm |title=Terror detainees win Lords appeal |publisher=BBC News |date=16 December 2004 |access-date=4 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331121756/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4100481.stm |archive-date=31 March 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> He authorised [[MI5]] to start collecting bulk telephone communications data on which telephone numbers called each other and when, authorised under a little understood general power under the [[Telecommunications Act 1984]] instead of the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] which would have brought independent oversight and regulation.

As Home Secretary, he was prepared to confront the judiciary and the police, with proposals for civilian community patrols and changes to police officers' pay and working conditions. More than 7,000 police demonstrated outside Parliament in 2002.

Also during his term in office, the massive upsurge in asylum claims was reversed, the Sangatte refugee camp on French soil was closed, and refugees numbers subsequently dropped from 110,000 to less than 30,000. With an additional 15,000 police officers and 6,500 Community Support Officers by 2004, crime had reached an all-time low with over a 40% drop from ten years earlier.<ref>{{cite news |last=Silverman |first=Jon |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4099909.stm |title=Blunkett leaves a mixed legacy |publisher=BBC News |date=15 December 2004 |access-date=4 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219145840/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4099909.stm |archive-date=19 February 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A controversial area for Blunkett was [[civil liberties]], and he described civil libertarianism as "airy fairy".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/1666371.stm "Airy fairy libertarians: Attack of the muesli-eaters?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040708194916/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/1666371.stm |date=8 July 2004 }}, ''BBC'', 20 November 2001.</ref> As Education Secretary, he had repeatedly expressed the intention that, were he to become Home Secretary, he would make the then-incumbent [[Jack Straw]], who had been criticised for being hard-line, seem over-[[liberalism|liberal]]. In 2006, Martin Narey, the former director general of the prison service, claimed that Blunkett had once told him to use the army and machine guns, to deal with rioting prisoners. Blunkett has denied these allegations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6057528.stm|title=Blunkett 'gave machine-gun order'|date=17 October 2006|access-date=11 November 2018|work=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111215832/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6057528.stm|archive-date=11 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Blunkett radically overhauled 'Victorian' sex offences legislation in 2002, which modernised the sex offences laws dramatically in relation to same-sex and related issues by sweeping away the archaic laws governing homosexuality, while tightening protections against rapists, paedophiles and other sex offenders.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Batty |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/nov/24/crime.penal |title=Q&A: Sex Offences Act |work=The Guardian |date=25 November 2003 |access-date=24 October 2011 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106005855/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/nov/24/crime.penal |archive-date=6 November 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The act closed a loophole that had allowed those accused of child rape to escape punishment by arguing the act was consensual and a new offence of adult sexual activity with a child, which covers any sex act that takes place between an adult and a child under 16, was introduced.

In 2004, it emerged that Blunkett had directed Home Office civil servants to closely monitor and counter the findings of [[MigrationWatch UK]], which controversially included manipulating the timing of statistical releases to avoid criticism from the pressure group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-dirty-war-on-migration-watchdog-5099f8lphtd |title=Labour dirty war on migration watchdog &#124; The Sunday Times |publisher=Thetimes.co.uk |date=22 August 2004 |access-date=10 February 2020}}</ref>

===Brief return to the cabinet===
[[File:With former Home Secretary David Blunkett MP.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Blunkett in 2009]]
Following the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], Blunkett was returned to the cabinet as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, where he faced a growing [[pensions crisis]].

Two weeks before the election, Blunkett took up a directorship in a company called [[DNA Bioscience]] and bought £15,000 of shares in the company. After sustained questions over a six-month period, Blunkett was asked on 31 October 2005 to explain why he had not consulted the [[Advisory Committee on Business Appointments]] regarding the directorship. Having placed the shares into an independent trust, he said that the trustees had agreed to dispose of the shares.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,9174,1605443,00.html?gusrc=rss | title=Blunkett promises to sell shares | first=Matthew | last=Tempest | date=31 October 2005 | work=The Guardian | location=London | access-date=29 January 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616145645/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,9174,1605443,00.html?gusrc=rss | archive-date=16 June 2006 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Blunkett's political opponents claimed that a conflict of interest was created by him having been director of and holding shares in a company proposing to bid for government contracts to provide paternity tests to the [[Child Support Agency]] (CSA) – part of the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (DWP), of which he was Secretary of State. On 2 November, a scheduled appearance before a House of Commons [[Parliamentary Select Committees of the United Kingdom|Select Committee]] was cancelled at the last minute and Blunkett was summoned to a meeting at [[10 Downing Street]]. Later that morning, a spokesman for Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] confirmed Blunkett had resigned at the meeting, stating that his position had become untenable. This became the main focus of discussion at the session of [[Prime Minister’s Questions]] that afternoon, and Conservative leader [[Michael Howard]] described the event as 'the beginning of the final chapter of (Blair’s) administration'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2005-11-02d.818.8&s=Administration+speaker%3A10290#g821.2|title=Engagements {{!}} Prime Minister – in the House of Commons at 11:30 am on 2nd November 2005|website=TheyWorkForYou.com|access-date=17 November 2020}}</ref>

Blunkett was later found not to have broken the ministerial code. On 25 November 2005, after he had resigned, [[Gus O'Donnell]] wrote to Blunkett confirming that there was no conflict of interest, no failure to declare either Blunkett's shareholding or brief business connection with the company.<ref name="The Blunkett Tapes p.856">''The Blunkett Tapes'', David Blunkett, p.856.</ref> O'Donnell wrote: "The issue of shareholdings and trusts and the handling of private interests more generally is of course covered quite extensively in Section 5 of the Ministerial Code. There is no ban on a Minister, or his or her immediate family members, holding such interests but where they do the Minister must ensure that no conflict arises, or appears to arise, between his or her public duties and such private interests. In terms of the handling of your interests, and those of your family, you followed correct procedure in notifying your Permanent Secretary of your interests. Neither the DWP nor the CSA were in any contractual relationship with DNA Bioscience, and the CSA's contract for biometric testing was not due to be renewed for some years."<ref name="The Blunkett Tapes p.856"/>

O’Donnell also confirmed that the Advisory Committee on Ministerial Appointments, which had been the bone of contention up to the beginning of November 2005, was in fact voluntary. The code was changed in 2007 to make clear that references prior to taking business appointments shortly after leaving government was to be mandatory as part of the ministerial code.

Despite his resignation from the cabinet in November, Blunkett initially kept his ministerial accommodation in [[Belgravia]], London, until he found new accommodation four months later.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4798182.stm | title=Blunkett wins affair claim payout | date=12 March 2006 | publisher=BBC | access-date=2 January 2010}}</ref> He also rents a cottage on the estate of [[Chatsworth House]].<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/pandora/article339804.ece "Blunkett still hangs on at 'disgrace and favour' pad"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714164504/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/pandora/article339804.ece |date=14 July 2007 }}, Guy Adams, ''The Independent'', 20 January 2006.</ref>

He sits on the board of the [[National Citizen Service]] Trust, a voluntary community service programme for 16- and 17-year-olds.<ref name=huffpost-20170502>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/big-society-scheme-boosts-university-places-for-poorest-by-50-says-lord-blunkett_uk_59085406e4b05c3976823575 |title='Big Society' Scheme Boosts University Places For Poorest By 50%, Says Lord Blunkett |last=Forrester |first=Kate |publisher=Huffington Post |date=2 May 2017 |access-date=23 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721123715/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/big-society-scheme-boosts-university-places-for-poorest-by-50-says-lord-blunkett_uk_59085406e4b05c3976823575 |archive-date=21 July 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> From 2013 to 2014, he chaired a parliamentary inquiry with the [[Charities Aid Foundation]] into how giving to charities could be boosted. This reported in June 2014, making recommendations ranging from the inclusion of a ‘social action’ section on UCAS forms to the creation of a post-careers advice service, for those who are retiring but wish to continue giving in their community. This led to the [[National Citizen Service Act 2017|National Citizen Service Act]] coming into law in 2017.

Between June 2013 and May 2014, Blunkett led a review into local oversight of schools and the raising of standards for the leader [[Ed Miliband]] and the Shadow Education Secretary. The ‘Blunkett Report’ was published in May 2014, and called for the creation of new independent Directors of School Standards to operate between local authorities. These directors would focus on bringing greater coherence to the process of school creation, raising standards and improving local accountability.

In June 2014, he announced he would not be contesting the election in the following year, stating that he had realised he would not be returning to the frontbenches. In his letter he wrote: "it is clear that the leadership of the Party wish to see new faces in Ministerial office and a clear break with the past".<ref name="labourlist.org"/>

==Writing, speaking and television appearances==
{{Main|The Blunkett Tapes}}
In October 2006, David Blunkett's audio diaries were published in his book ''The Blunkett Tapes: My Life in the Bear Pit''. The tapes detail his time as a cabinet minister until the present date, and provide insights into the workings of the Labour cabinet. They were recorded every week, and contain his view of what was happening in Cabinet at the time, alongside contemporary reflections and more recent thoughts on the events.

He also published a light-hearted dog-orientated look back at his life so far, in ''On a Clear Day'', published by Michael O'Mara Books in 1995.<ref>{{cite book|title=On a Clear Day |first=David|last=Blunkett|first2=Alex |last2= MacCormick|publisher=[[Michael O'Mara Books]] |edition = Revised |year=2002| isbn= 978-1-84317-007-5}}</ref>

Blunkett has also co-authored a number of publications including ''Building from the Bottom'' (1982), published by the [[Fabian Society]], and ''Democracy in Crisis'' (1987), published by Hogarth, which described the battle between local and central government in the Thatcher years. He has also contributed chapters to many books relating to politics and social policy and has also produced research papers with the University of Sheffield. Other publications include "Ladders Out of Poverty" in 2006 and "Mutual Action, Common Purpose" in 2009 (relating to the voluntary sector).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A-Ladder-Out-of-Poverty-from-state-dependence-to-self-reliance.pdf |title=Poverty Ladder |access-date=2 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924090219/http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A-Ladder-Out-of-Poverty-from-state-dependence-to-self-reliance.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://base-uk.org/sites/base-uk.org/files/news/09-01/mutual_action_common_purpose.pdf |title=Mutual Action, Common Purpose: Empowering the Third Sector |access-date=31 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402184853/http://base-uk.org/sites/base-uk.org/files/news/09-01/mutual_action_common_purpose.pdf |archive-date=2 April 2015  }}</ref>
