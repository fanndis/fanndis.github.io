== COVID-19 response ==
In March 2020, SoulCycle closed all of its then 99 studios due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name="NYT" /> As a result of accelerated consumer demand for at-home fitness options,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Griffith |first=Erin |title=People Are Panic-Buying Meat, Toilet Paper … and Pelotons? | work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/technology/peloton-boom-workout-virus.html |date=May 6, 2020 | url-access=subscription |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> the company lost part of its market share to [[Peloton (company)|Peloton]], a firm offering stationary bikes used to stream at-home spin classes.<ref name="NYT" /> While SoulCycle had announced a similar product in August 2019 in partnership with the digital platform Variis, it only began shipping in May 2020, six months later than initially planned.<ref name="NYT" />

As a result of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], in March 2020, SoulCycle enacted furloughs and pay cuts for many employees and began laying off between five and ten percent of its staff in the following month.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Strachan |first=Maxwell |title=SoulCycle Lays Off Long-Time Employees With Zero Severance| url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/m7jaqq/soulcycle-lays-off-long-time-employees-with-zero-severance |url-status=live | work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]| date=May 18, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203012/soulcycle-staff-pay-cut-furlough-coronavirus-pandemic | title=SoulCycle cuts staff pay by 25 percent while putting studio crew on indefinite furlough | first=Natt | last=Garun | work=[[The Verge]] | date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>

In June 2020, SoulCycle made the decision to permanently close their Scarsdale studio in Westchester, NY and riders were notified in an email. The studios in Malibu, Calabasas, Culver City, Boston's Beacon Hill, Union Square NYC, and West 60th Street in NYC closed soon after as well as a means to consolidate given the economic pressures brought on by COVID-19.

In July 2020, the company closed its King Street studio in Toronto. In an email sent to local customers, SoulCycle cited pandemic-related financial difficulties as reasoning for the location's abrupt closure.<ref>{{Cite news |title=SoulCycle Shuts Down Toronto's King Street Location| url=https://www.ellecanada.com/beauty/health-and-fitness/soulcycle-shuts-down-torontos-king-street-location | first= VICTORIA |last=DIPLACIDO | work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]] | date=July 16, 2020}}</ref> The event marked SoulCycle's second permanent studio closure in recent history, and the first as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Biron|first=Bethany|date=2019-01-11|title=Flywheel and SoulCycle are having an identity crisis|url=https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/1/11/18176929/flywheel-soulcycle-peloton-spinning-bubble-cycling-class|access-date=2020-07-17|website=Vox|language=en}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2020}}
