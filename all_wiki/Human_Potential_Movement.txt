{{short description|Cultivating extraordinary potential that its advocates believe to lie largely untapped in all people.}}
The '''Human Potential Movement''' ('''HPM''') arose out of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] movement of the 1960s<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/us/18leonard1.html?_r=0 |title = George Leonard, Voice of '60s Counterculture, Dies at 86 |last1 = Martin |first1 = Douglas |date = January 18, 2010 |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |accessdate = 2014-05-20 }}</ref> and formed around the concept of cultivating extraordinary potential that its advocates believe to lie largely untapped in all people. The movement took as its premise the belief that through the development of "human potential", humans can experience an exceptional quality of [[personal life|life]] filled with [[happiness]], [[creativity]], and [[Personal fulfillment|fulfillment]].  As a corollary, those who begin to unleash this assumed potential often find themselves directing their actions within society toward assisting others to release their [[Potentiality and actuality|potential]].  Adherents believe that the net effect of individuals cultivating their potential will bring about positive [[social change]] at large.

The emergence of HPM is linked to [[humanistic psychology]]. The movement is strongly influenced by [[Abraham Maslow]]'s theory of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs#Self-actualization|self-actualization]] as the supreme expression of a human's life.  [[The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential]], founded in 1955 by Glenn Doman and Carl Delacato, was an early precusor to and influence on the Human Potential Movement, with Doman quoted as stating, “Every child born has, at the moment of birth, a greater potential intelligence than Leonardo da Vinci ever used.”<ref>{{Cite web|title=Letter From Glenn Doman|url=https://www.gentlerevolution.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=LETTER&Store_Code=G|access-date=2020-10-05|website=www.gentlerevolution.com}}</ref>

In the middle of the 1960s, [[George Leonard]] did research across the United States on the subject of human potential for the magazine ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]''. In his research, he interviewed 37 psychiatrists, brain researchers, and philosophers on the subject of human potential. He found that "Not one of them said we were using more than 10% of our capacity."<ref name="Wayne2005">{{cite book |title = Quantum Integral Medicine: Toward a New Science of Healing and Human Potential |first = Michael |last = Wayne |publisher = iThink Books |year = 2005 |page = [https://archive.org/details/quantumintegralm00mich/page/22 22] |isbn = 978-0976679707 |url = https://archive.org/details/quantumintegralm00mich/page/22 }}</ref>

During the course of this research, Leonard met [[Michael_Murphy_(author)|Michael Murphy]], the founder of the nascent [[Esalen Institute]] that at the time was running educational programs for adults on the topic of "human potentialities". Leonard and Murphy became close friends and together put forth the idea that there should be a human potential movement.<ref name="Wayne2005"/>

==Social influence==
HPM was regarded by some as being related to [[Psychedelia|psychedelic culture]] such as [[hippie]]s and [[Summer of Love]].<ref>{{cite news |url = http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-21/news/mn-8912_1_san-francisco-establishment |title = 20 Years After Hippie Invasion : The Summer of Love That Left Its Imprint on S.F. |first = Mark A. |last = Stein |date = June 21, 1987 |newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate = September 16, 2015 }}</ref> According to author Andrew Grant Jackson, [[George Harrison]]'s adoption of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] philosophy and Indian instrumentation in his songs with [[the Beatles]] in the mid 1960s, together with the band's highly publicised study of [[Transcendental Meditation]], "truly kick-started" the Human Potential Movement.<ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew Grant|last=Jackson|title=1965: The Most Revolutionary Year in Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QI3BAAAQBAJ&pg=PR16|date=2015|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-250-05962-8|p=282}}</ref> 

As Elizabeth Puttick writes in the ''Encyclopedia of New Religions'':

<blockquote>The human potential movement (HPM) originated in the 1960s as a counter-cultural rebellion against mainstream psychology and organised religion. It is not in itself a religion, new or otherwise, but a psychological philosophy and framework, including a set of values that have made it one of the most significant and influential forces in modern Western society.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last = Puttick |first = Elizabeth |editor-last = Hugh |editor-first = Christopher |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of New Religions |title = Human Potential Movement |year = 2004 |publisher = Lion |location = Oxford |isbn = 9780745950730 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofne0000unse_d3h6/page/399 399] |url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofne0000unse_d3h6/page/399 }}</ref></blockquote>

==Authors and essayists==
[[Abraham Maslow]] published his concept of a [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]] in a paper in 1943. He argued that as people's basic survival needs are met, so their desire to grow in mental and emotional dimensions increases. He also coined the term 'metamotivation' to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]] and [[Dick Price]] founded the [[Esalen Institute]] in 1962, primarily as a center for the study and development of human potential, and some people continue to regard Esalen as the geographical center of the movement {{As of|2007|alt=today}}.

[[Aldous Huxley]] gave lectures on the "Human Potential" at Esalen in the early 1960s. His writings and lectures on the mystical dimensions of psychedelics and on what he called "the [[perennial philosophy]]" were foundational. Moreover, his call for an institution that could teach the 'nonverbal humanities' and the development of the 'human potentialities' functioned as the working mission statement of early Esalen.<ref>{{cite book |last = Kripal |first = Jeffrey |title = Esalen America and the Religion of No Religion |publisher = University of Chicago Press |year = 2007 }}</ref>

[[Christopher Lasch]] notes the impact of the human potential movement via the [[psychotherapy|therapeutic sector]]: "The new therapies spawned by the human potential movement, according to Peter Marin, teach that "the individual will is all powerful and totally determines one's fate"; thus they intensify the "isolation of the self".<ref>{{cite book |first = Christopher |last = Lasch |title = The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations |url = https://archive.org/details/cultureofnarciss00lascrich |url-access = registration |location = New York |publisher = Norton |year = 1979 |page = [https://archive.org/details/cultureofnarciss00lascrich/page/9 9] |isbn = 0393011771 }} Quoting {{cite news |first = Peter |last = Marin |title = The New Narcissism |magazine = [[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]] |date = October 1975 |page = 48 }}

[[George Leonard]], a magazine writer and editor who conducted research for an article on human potential, became an important early influence on Esalen. Leonard claims that he coined the phrase "Human Potential Movement" during a brainstorming session with Michael Murphy, and popularized it in his 1972 book ''The Transformation: A Guide to the Inevitable Changes in Mankind''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Transformation: A Guide to the Inevitable Changes in Humankind|last=Leonard|first=George|publisher=Tarcher|year=1972|isbn=978-0-87477-169-5|url=https://archive.org/details/transformationgu00leon}}</ref> Leonard worked closely with the Esalen Institute afterwards, and in 2005 served as its president.

== Human Potential in Europe==
[[File:Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs2.svg|alt=|thumb|480x480px|Maslow's hierarchy of needs, represented as a pyramid with the more basic needs at the bottom<ref name=honolulu>[http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/intranet/committees/FacDevCom/guidebk/teachtip/maslow.hatm Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>]]
Human Potential concepts found in Europe a growing interest thanks to training courses aimed at managers, graduate students, and unemployed, mainly funded by the [[European Union]] in public development courses in the 1980s and 90s.<ref>{{Citation | editor1-last = Phillips | editor1-first = D. | editor2-last = Ertl | editor2-first = H | year = 2003 | title = Implementing European Union Education and Training Policy. A Comparative Study of Issues in Four Member States | publisher = Springer}}.</ref> In these courses, modules such as communication skills, marketing, leadership and others in the "soft skills" area were embedded in the programs, and enabled the familiarization of most of the Human Potential concepts. A key role was played by "EU Strategic objective 3, 4, and 5" that explicitly included transversal key competences, such as learning to learn, a sense of initiative, entrepreneurship, and cultural awareness".<ref>Official Journal of the European Union, Council conclusions of 12 May 2009 on a strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training, 2009/C 119/02</ref>

These training programs, lasting as much as 900 to 1200 hours{{efn|For context, 1200 hours translates to 150 days of full time training at 8 hours per day}} aimed at enhancing creativity and innovation, including entrepreneurship, and contained at all levels of education and training Human Potential concepts. One of the core concepts, [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], a theory of psychological health predicated on fulfilling innate human needs, became popular in Europe in the 80s mainly as a support to understanding consumer's needs, and only after its use as a key marketing concept. Philip Kotler's book "Marketing Management" was particularly influential in the 80's in popularizing several human potential concepts that were "embedded" in the book<ref>Kotler, Philip (1984), Marketing Management: Analysis, Planning, and Control.  Published by Prentice-Hall, Inc., first edition 1984. {{ISBN|9780135579275}}</ref> and entered in the working and management community.

Specifically targeted books on Human Potential have emerged in Europe and can be found in the works of specific authors. For the "Anglo" cultural area, the work of [[John Whitmore (racing driver)|John Whitmore]]<!-- also a noted writer on leadership and coaching --><ref>Whitmore, John (1992), Coaching for Performance: Growing Human Potential and Purpose: The Principles and Practice of Coaching and Leadership, Brealey Publishing (first edition)</ref>
contains a harsh critique of mainstream approaches to human potential as fast cures for self-improvement: "Contrary to the appealing claims of [[The One Minute Manager]], there are no quick fixes in business".<ref>{{Citation | last = Whitmore | first = John 2010 | title = Coaching for Performance: Growing Human Potential and Purpose: The Principles and Practice of Coaching and Leadership | publisher = Brealey | edition = 4th | chapter = Introduction | page = 2}}.</ref>

For the "Latin" cultural area, an early approach to Human Potential can be found in the work of [[Maria Montessori]]. Montessori's theory and philosophy of education were influenced by the work of [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]], [[Édouard Séguin]], [[Friedrich Fröbel]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]. Her model emphasized autonomous learning, sensory exploration and training children in physical activities, empowering their senses and thoughts by exposure to sights, smells, and tactile experiences, and later included, problem solving.
