==Plot==
In "9 months B.C.", Mary is visited by an angel telling her she will bear the [[Messiah]]. A pygmy [[jerboa]] named Abby overhears and tells the other animals as a [[Star of Bethlehem|star]] begins glowing brightly in the night.

Six months later, a young [[donkey]] is tired of milling wheat and wishes to join a traveling royal caravan so that he may feel important. An older donkey helps him escape the miller who owns them, and the young donkey ends up with an injured ankle at the house of Joseph and Mary who have just celebrated their wedding. Mary takes the donkey in and names him Bo, and reveals to Joseph that she is pregnant, with Joseph accepting Mary's situation after praying to God. During this time, Bo and his [[dove]] friend, Dave plot to escape despite Mary's kindness, but end up staying three more months.

Meanwhile, the [[Biblical Magi|three wise men]] and their camels, Felix, Cyrus, and Deborah, arrive at the home of [[Herod the Great|King Herod]]. The wise men reveal their gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]], but when they reveal that it is actually for the "new King", he sends them on their way to meet him, but secretly sends his royal hunter and his two dogs, Thaddeus and Rufus, to find and kill the new King.

As Joseph and Mary leave [[Nazareth]] in order to head to [[Bethlehem]], Bo and Dave try another escape, but are confronted by the dogs, who knew of the home by interrogating Abby. After learning that Joseph and Mary are not home, the hunter and his dogs leave to look for them. Feeling guilty, Bo decides to warn them with Dave joining him. Along the way, they meet a friendly sheep named Ruth who left her flock when she saw the star. They catch up to Joseph and Mary in time to warn them and hide them in a market place where the hunter ties up his dogs. Bo releases the cart Joseph and Mary were using to roll down and cause a chain reaction that knocks the hunter down a well. However, he creates severe damage to the market in the process, and Joseph, unaware of the danger, berates Bo for his actions.

Upset with being rejected, Bo leaves and Dave follows until they arrive at the royal caravan. While happy to have found it, Bo realizes that he liked being with Mary and tells Dave, who admits that he isn't upset and that he just wants Bo to be happy with his decision. Together, the two return and make up with Ruth, and then convince a frustrated Joseph to talk to Mary. Mary admits that it has been difficult for her and that she is scared of the importance of the baby, and they make up when Mary begins having [[Uterine contraction|contractions]]. They arrive at Bethlehem where Joseph can't find an inn for Mary. The miller, who just so happened to be there, kidnaps Bo with Dave and Ruth leaving to rescue him. The wise men arrive as well, but the camels, who are aware of Herod's plot, are left tied to a post.

Bo ends up in a stable where he meets a horse named Leah, a cow named Edith, and a goat named Zach. They reveal that they haven't been able to sleep because the star's bright light has been shining through on their [[manger]] for 9 months. Realizing that this is where the baby is supposed to be, the animals help Bo escape and he catches up with Dave and Ruth while spotting the hunter and his dogs. Bo finds Joseph and Mary and gets them back to the stable while Dave runs into Cyrus, Felix, and Deborah and helps them escape their bonds. Ruth finds her flock, who had previously refused to follow her, and tries to convince them to help, but gets unexpected help from the angel who informs the shepherds and the sheep that the Savior is coming. Bo manages to fight off Thaddeus and Rufus, but is outdone by the hunter. Suddenly, Ruth and her flock, the camels, and Dave arrive and dispatch with them by having them hang from a cliff. The hunter lets his dogs fall, but they are saved by Bo while the hunter himself falls to his death.

All of the animals, who are now joined by Abby who assumed the danger to be ongoing, and the redeemed Thaddeus & Rufus, shepherds, and three wise men arrive to see [[Jesus|baby Jesus]]. Bo realizes that he has been carrying the new King the whole time. Deborah predicts that this event will be remembered around the world for years to come.

During the credits, it is shown in pictures that Joseph buys Bo from the miller, and both Bo and Dave help him and Mary raise Jesus.

==Cast==
* '''Main Animal Characters'''
** '''Bo''' ([[Steven Yeun]]) - A young mill donkey who is loyal yet worrysome. He sees the star one night thinking it's a sign that his life is soon to change.  When he hears of the Royal Caravan marching into Nazareth, he feels this is his purpose and escapes to try to join it. But when he encounters Mary, he feels more dedicated to be with her and keep her out of danger.
** '''Dave''' ([[Keegan-Michael Key]]) - A sarcastic and egotiscial dove who is Bo's best friend. He joins Bo on his quest to join the Royal Caravan but is more set on that than he is at helping others.
** '''Ruth''' ([[Aidy Bryant]]) - A light-hearted, bubbly and naive sheep who left her flock to follow the star. She later joins Bo and Dave on their journey to Bethlehem with Mary and Joseph. At first, she's a nuisance to them, but Bo later grows a soft spot for her and soon becomes friends with her.
** '''Thaddeus''' ([[Ving Rhames]]) - A sinister purebred [[wolf]] who is determined to find the Son of God for his master.
** '''Rufus''' ([[Gabriel Iglesias]]) - An [[alaunt]] who is Thaddeus' dimwitted sidekick.
** '''Cyrus''' ([[Tyler Perry]]) - The leader of the three camels. He is smart, calm, and collective but usually isn't always right.
** '''Felix''' ([[Tracy Morgan]]) - The youngest of the three camels. He's the loudmouth comic relief of the trio, and he often gets into arguments with Cyrus.
** '''Deborah''' ([[Oprah Winfrey]]) - The only female of the three camels. She's the most down-to-earth of the trio, but the other two often think she's crazy despite her attempts at being the voice of reason and keeping her cohorts in check.
** '''Edith''' ([[Patricia Heaton]]) - A cow who lives at the stable where Mary and Joseph eventually end up at. She's the most level-headed of the animals who reside at the stable and is mostly unamused and pessimistic.
** '''Leah''' ([[Kelly Clarkson]]) - A horse who lives at the stable where Mary and Joseph eventually end up. She loves to sing, but more often than not, her singing is obnoxiously loud, which is most likely caused by her lack of sleep she got since the star began to shine over the stable.
** '''Zach''' ([[Anthony Anderson]]) - A goat who lives at the stable where Mary and Joseph eventually end up at. He has deformed eyes and is very hyper and paranoid due to the lack of sleep he got since the star began to shine over the stable.
** '''Abby''' ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]) - A pygmy jerboa who first witnesses the Angel coming to Mary. She tells her friends about it and tries to warn the others about the hunter.
* '''Main Human Characters'''

** '''[[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]''' ([[Zachary Levi]]) - A young carpenter who Mary marries soon to be the earthly father of Jesus. He's usually pessimistic and paranoid.
** '''[[Herod the Great|King Herod]]''' ([[Christopher Plummer]]) - The selfish, greedy, sinister king of Judea who hears about the new King who is arriving and sends the three wise men out to find Him in Bethlehem while secretly sending his hunter to find and kill Him.
** '''The Miller''' ([[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]]) - Bo's former owner who is determined to get him back after he escaped from his mill.
** '''The Hunter''' ([[Lex Lang]]) - A large, sinister, yet silent hunter whom King Herod sends out to kill the new King.

** [[Melchior (Magus)|Melchior]] ([[Fred Tatasciore]]) - One of the three wise men wearing red and Deborah's owner.

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an average rating by critics of 42% based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 4.94/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Star'' may not leave audiences singing 'Hallelujah', but its offbeat yet sincere approach to the nativity story makes for acceptably diverting holiday viewing."<ref>{{cite web |title= ''The Star'' (2017) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_star_2017 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=December 6, 2017}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a [[weighted average]] score of 42 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-star |title=''The Star'' reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=opening/>

''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s [[Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]] criticized ''The Star'' as a "rote cartoon feature" existing for purely commercial reasons: "...even the kid-friendliest, Sunday-school-iest kind of religious art can't spring from religion alone; it needs artistry, too. Otherwise, you end up with a generic product aimed at a market segment who'll buy anything as long as it seems sufficiently churchy."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vishnevetsky |first1=Ignatiy |date=November 16, 2017 |title=The animated trifle The Star passes the Nativity through its ass|url=https://www.avclub.com/the-animated-trifle-the-star-passes-the-nativity-throug-1820488093 |website=[[The A.V.
