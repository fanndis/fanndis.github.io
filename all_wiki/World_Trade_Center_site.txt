The '''World Trade Center site''', formerly referred to as "[[Ground zero|Ground Zero]]" or "the Pile" immediately after the [[September 11 attacks]], is a 14.6-acre (5.9&nbsp;ha) area in [[Lower Manhattan]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=David W.|title=In a Space This Sacred, Every Square Foot Counts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/29/nyregion/blocks-in-a-space-this-sacred-every-square-foot-counts.html|access-date=July 8, 2015|work=New York Times|date=April 29, 2004|ref=blocks-4-29-2004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | last=Barry | first=Dan | title=A Nation Challenged - The Site: 'At the Scene of Random Devastation, a Most Orderly Mission' | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 24, 2001 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEFDD143AF937A1575AC0A9679C8B63 | access-date=July 31, 2010}}</ref> The site is bounded by [[Vesey Street (Manhattan)|Vesey Street]] to the north, the [[West Side Highway]] to the west, [[Liberty Street (Manhattan)|Liberty Street]] to the south, and [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]] to the east.

==Before the World Trade Center==
[[File:Radio Row-Berenice Abbott.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Radio Row]] in 1936, with the [[Cortlandt Street (IRT Ninth Avenue Line)|Cortlandt Street]] station in the background]]
The western portion of the World Trade Center site was originally under the Hudson River, with the shoreline in the vicinity of Greenwich Street. On this shoreline close to the intersection of Greenwich Street and the former Dey Street, Dutch explorer [[Adriaen Block]]'s ship, the ''[[Tyger (ship)|Tyger]]'', burned to the waterline in November 1613, stranding Block and his crew and forcing them to overwinter on the island. The remains of the ship were buried under landfill when the shoreline was extended starting in 1797, and were discovered during excavation work in 1916. The remains of another ship from the eighteenth century were found in 2010 during excavation work at the site. The ship, believed to be a Hudson River [[sloop]], was found just south of where the Twin Towers used to stand, about 20 feet below the surface.<ref>[http://articles.cnn.com/2010-07-15/us/new.york.ground.zero.ship_1_ship-archaeologist-ground-zero?_s=PM:US CNN: Pieces of ship made in 1700s found at ground zero building site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113070306/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-07-15/us/new.york.ground.zero.ship_1_ship-archaeologist-ground-zero?_s=PM%3AUS |date=January 13, 2011 }}</ref>

The area that was cleared for construction of the original World Trade Center complex was previously occupied by various electronics stores in what was called [[Radio Row]]. These streets and stores were demolished in the 1960s to make way for the World Trade Center.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/lnfsound/stories/020603.radiorow.html |title='Radio Row:' The neighborhood before the World Trade Center |access-date=October 1, 2006 |date=June 3, 2002 |publisher=National Public Radio}}</ref>

At the time of their completion the "Twin Towers"—the original 1 World Trade Center (the North Tower), at 1,368&nbsp;ft (417 metres), and 2 World Trade Center (the South Tower)—were the [[History of the tallest buildings in the world#Tallest buildings (from 1901)|tallest buildings]] in the world. The other buildings in the complex included the [[Marriott World Trade Center]] (3 WTC), [[Four World Trade Center|4 WTC]], [[Five World Trade Center|5 WTC]], [[6 World Trade Center|6 WTC]], and [[7 World Trade Center|7 WTC]]. All of these buildings were built between 1975 and 1985, with a construction cost of $400&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|400000000|1971|{{Inflation-year|US}}|r=-8}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).{{Inflation-fn|US}} The complex was located in New York City's [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] and contained {{convert|13400000|sqft|m2}} of office space.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E4D81030F935A35752C0A9649C8B63 |title=Commercial Property; In Office Market, a Time of Uncertainty |work=The New York Times |author=Holusha, John |date=January 6, 2002 |access-date=November 21, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_30_48/ai_83762552 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526191512/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_30_48/ai_83762552 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 26, 2012 |title=Ford recounts details of Sept. 11 |work=Real Estate Weekly |date=February 27, 2002 |publisher=BNET |access-date=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>

The World Trade Center experienced a fire on {{Nowrap|February 13}}, 1975, a [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|bombing]] on {{Nowrap|February 26}}, 1993 and [[1998 Bank of America robbery|a robbery]] on {{Nowrap|January 14}}, 1998.

According to NIST, when WTC 1 (the North Tower) collapsed, falling debris struck 7 World Trade Center and ignited fires on multiple floors.

Shortly after the attacks, the surrounding buildings were fitted with red mesh to prevent further damage. In November 2001, the remaining portions of [[4 World Trade Center|Building 4]] were leveled.

In December 2001, a temporary viewing platform at Fulton Street, between Church Street and Broadway, was opened to the public.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hirschkorn |first=Phil |title=A NATION CHALLENGED: GROUND ZERO; First Viewing Platform Opens to the Public |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 30, 2001 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE0D71630F933A05751C1A9679C8B63 |access-date=July 31, 2010}}</ref> That month, the last standing perimeter columns from the North Tower and the last remaining portions of [[Six World Trade Center|Building 6]] were removed.

Starting March 11, 2002, eighty-eight searchlights were installed and arranged to form two beams of light shooting straight up into the sky. This was called the ''[[Tribute in Light]]'', and was originally lit every day at dusk until April 14, 2002. After that, the lights were lit on the two-year anniversary of the attack and have been lit on each subsequent September 11 since then.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dunlap |first=David W. |title=Twin Beams to Light Sky Again.

Portions of the South Tower had also damaged the nearby [[Deutsche Bank Building]], which soon became filled with toxic dust. By 2002, [[Deutsche Bank]] determined that its building was unsalvageable and it was scheduled for demolition.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/03/19/news/companies/ground_zero.fortune/index.htm |title=The tombstone at Ground Zero |last=Varchaver |first=Nicholas |date=March 20, 2008 |newspaper=[[CNN]]}}</ref> In January 2011, the demolition of the Deutsche Bank Building was completed.<ref>{{cite news| title=10 Years After 9/11, Deutsche Bank Tower Vanishes| url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/ten-years-after-911-the-wounded-deutsche-bank-tower-vanishes/| access-date=September 11, 2012| newspaper=The New York Times| date=January 12, 2011}}</ref>

===Archaeology===
In July 2010, a team of [[archaeologist]]s at the site discovered the remains of a {{convert|32|ft|m|adj=on}}-long boat over 200 years old; it was probably made in the 18th century and dumped there along with wooden beams and trash in about 1810 to make up the land.<ref>{{cite web | last=Associated Press | title=Ground Zero diggers uncover hull of 18th century ship | website=the Guardian | date=July 15, 2010 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/15/world-trade-centre-hull-ship | access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref> The boat had been weighted to make it sink as part of foundations for a new [[pier]]. Samples of its wood have been taken for [[dendrochronology]].

===Ownership status===
While the PANYNJ is often identified as the owner of the WTC site, the ownership situation was complicated after the September 11 attacks. The Port Authority did own a "significant" internal portion of the site of {{convert|16|acre|ha}} but has acknowledged "ambiguities over ownership of miscellaneous strips of property at the World Trade Center site" going back to the 1960s. It was unclear who owned {{convert|2.5|acre|ha}} of the site which is land where streets had been before the World Trade Center was built.<ref>{{Cite news  | last=Dunlap  | first=David W.  | title=Who Owns Ground Zero?

Soon after the September 11 attacks, [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[List of Governors of New York|Governor]] [[George Pataki]], and President [[George W. Bush]] vowed to rebuild the World Trade Center site. On the day of the attacks, Giuliani proclaimed, "We will rebuild. We're going to come out of this stronger than before, politically stronger, economically stronger. The skyline will be made whole again."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2001/0926/today.html |title=Rebuilding in New York |date=September 26, 2001 |author=Taylor, Tess |magazine=Architecture Week |access-date=May 16, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511012010/http://www.architectureweek.com/2001/0926/today.html |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During a visit to the site on September 14, 2001, Bush spoke to a crowd of cleanup workers through a megaphone.

The original twin towers took less than three years from start of construction to be finished and five years from the beginning planning stages. However, given the complexity and highly political nature of the rebuilding efforts, they are often cited as an example of a successful public-private collaboration and are taught as a case study in successful negotiations.<ref>Cornell Real Estate Review, Volume 10, Number 1 (July 2012), 39-53, http://cip.cornell.edu/cpre.crer/1342144023; http://www.cornell.edu/video/?videoID=1680</ref>

===Early proposals for redesign===
{{New World Trade Center}}

====Lower Manhattan Development Corporation====
Governor Pataki established the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]] (LMDC) in November 2001, as an official commission to oversee the rebuilding process.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Pérez-Peña |first=Richard |title=A NATION CHALLENGED: DOWNTOWN; State Plans Rebuilding Agency, Perhaps Led by Giuliani |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 3, 2001 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFD81639F930A35752C1A9679C8B63 |access-date=July 31, 2010}}</ref> The LMDC coordinates [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] assistance in the rebuilding process, and works with the PANYNJ, Larry Silverstein, and [[Studio Daniel Libeskind]], the master plan architect for the site's redesign. The corporation also handles communication with the local community, businesses, the city of New York, and relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Corporation to Rebuild Ground Zero |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/04/opinion/a-corporation-to-rebuild-ground-zero.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 4, 2001 |access-date=July 31, 2010}}</ref> A 16-member board of directors, half appointed by the governor and half by the mayor of New York, governs the LMDC.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Governor and Mayor Name Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation |publisher=www.RenewNYC.org |date=November 29, 2001 |url=http://www.renewnyc.com/displaynews.aspx?newsid=2b0bfde6-61b6-48f9-a6ca-70475846c95b |access-date=June 16, 2008}}</ref>

The LMDC had questionable legal status regarding the restoration of the World Trade Center site, because the Port Authority owns most of the property and Larry Silverstein leased the World Trade Center's office space in July 2001. But the LMDC, in an April 2002 articulation of its principles for action, asserted its role in revitalizing lower Manhattan.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation Announces Principles for Development and Blueprint for Renewal for World Trade Center Site |publisher=www.RenewNYC.org |date=April 9, 2002 |url=http://www.renewnyc.com/displaynews.aspx?newsid=112d53af-0d20-44ec-89d7-23f397b5a569 |access-date=June 16, 2008}}</ref>

====Directly after the attacks====
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:New wtc.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendering of proposed design with September 11 Memorial in the foreground]] -->
In the months following the attacks, [[architect]]s and [[urban planning]] experts held meetings and forums to discuss ideas for rebuilding the site.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Up From The Ashes |magazine=Newsweek |date=November 12, 2001 |author=McGuigan, Cathleen}}</ref> In January 2002, New York City [[art dealer]] [[Max Protetch]] solicited 50 concepts and [[Rendering (computer graphics)|renderings]] from artists and architects, which were put on exhibit in his [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] [[art gallery]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Everyone Weighs In With Rebuilding Ideas |first=Edward |last=Wyatt |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/12/nyregion/ground-zero-the-proposals-everyone-weighs-in-with-rebuilding-ideas.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 11, 2002 |access-date=July 31, 2010}}</ref>

In April 2002, the LMDC sent out requests for proposals to redesign the World Trade Center site to 24 Manhattan architecture firms, but then soon withdrew them. The following month, the LMDC selected [[Beyer Blinder Belle]] as planner for the redesign of the World Trade Center site.<ref>{{cite news |title=An Appraisal; Marginal Role for Architecture at Ground Zero |first=Herbert |last=Muschamp |author-link=Herbert Muschamp |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404EEDB1E38F930A15756C0A9649C8B63 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 23, 2002 |access-date=July 31, 2010}}</ref>

In an August 2002 press release, the LMDC announced a design study for the World Trade Center site.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation Announces Design Study for World Trade Center Site and Surrounding Areas |publisher=www.RenewNYC.org |date=August 14, 2002 |url=http://www.renewnyc.com/displaynews.aspx?newsid=da800006-c35b-4f1c-a9ec-ff53cfe45ae2 |access-date=August 7, 2008}}</ref> The following month, the LMDC, along with New York New Visions – a coalition of 21 architecture, engineering, planning, landscape architecture and design organizations – announced seven semifinalists. The following seven architecture firms were then invited to compete to be the master plan architect for the World Trade Center:
*[[Foster and Partners]] ([[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]])
*[[Studio Daniel Libeskind]] ([[Daniel Libeskind]])
*Meier Eisenman Gwathmey Holl ([[Peter Eisenman]], [[Richard Meier]], [[Charles Gwathmey]] and [[Steven Holl]]), known as "[[The New York Five]]"
*[[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]]
*[[THINK Team]] ([[Shigeru Ban]], [[Frederic Schwartz]], [[Ken Smith (architect)|Ken Smith]], [[Rafael Viñoly]])
*United Architects
Peterson Littenberg, a small New York architecture firm, had been enlisted by the LMDC earlier that summer as a consultant, and was invited to participate as the seventh semifinalist.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation Announces Six Teams of Architects and Planners to Participate in Design Study of World Trade Center Site |publisher=www.RenewNYC.org |date=September 26, 2002 |url=http://www.renewnyc.com/displaynews.aspx?newsid=655798f4-b8ee-4583-bf27-b3b9a9c29f1f |access-date=June 16, 2008}}</ref>

The seven semifinalists presented their entries to the public on December 18, 2002, at the [[Winter Garden Atrium|Winter Garden]] of the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|World Financial Center]]. In the following weeks, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill withdrew its entry from the competition.<ref>{{cite news |title=Beauty Contest: Two Firms Vie At W.T.C.

Days before the announcement of the two finalists in February 2003, Larry Silverstein wrote to LMDC Chair [[John C. Whitehead|John Whitehead]] to express his disapproval of all of the semifinalists' designs. As the Twin Towers' insurance money recipient, Silverstein claimed that he had the sole right to decide what would be built. He announced that he had already picked Skidmore, Owings & Merrill as his master planner for the site.<ref name=breakingground>{{cite book |last=Libeskind |first=Daniel |title=Breaking Ground |publisher=[[Riverhead Books]] |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/breakinggroundad00libe/page/164 164, 166, 181, 183] |isbn=1-57322-292-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/breakinggroundad00libe/page/164 }}</ref>

On February 1, 2003, the LMDC selected two finalists, the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind, and planned on picking a single winner by the end of the month. Rafael Viñoly of the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind presented their designs to the LMDC, which selected the THINK design. Earlier the same day, however, [[Roland Betts]], a member of the LMDC, had called a meeting and the corporation had agreed to vote for the THINK design before hearing the final presentations. Governor Pataki, who had originally commissioned the LMDC, intervened and overruled the LMDC's decision.<ref name=breakingground /> On February 27, 2003, Studio Daniel Libeskind officially won the competition to be the master planner for the World Trade Center redesign.

Libeskind's original proposal, which is titled [[Memory Foundations]], underwent extensive revisions during collaboration with Larry Silverstein, and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, whom Silverstein hired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renewnyc.com/plan_des_dev/wtc_site/new_design_plans/Sept_2003_refined_design.asp|title=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation|website=www.renewnyc.com|access-date=August 8, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416100733/http://www.renewnyc.com/plan_des_dev/wtc_site/new_design_plans/Sept_2003_refined_design.asp|archive-date=April 16, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Though Libeskind designed the site, the individual buildings have been designed by different architects. While not all of Liebeskind's ideas were incorporated into the final design, his design and the public support it garnered did solidify the principle that the original footprints of the Twin Towers should be turned into a memorial and not be used for commercial purposes.  As a result, Liebeskind's lawyers at the New York firm of Wachtell Lipton embarked on the multi-year negotiation process to frame a master plan for the rebuilding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtc.com/news/Silversteins-Army|title=Silverstein's Army -- World Trade Center|website=www.wtc.com}}</ref>  The first step in this process, completed in 2003, was the "swap" in which Silverstein gave up his rights to the footprints of the Twin Towers so that they could become a memorial, and in exchange received the right to build five new office towers around the memorial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanlawyer-digital.com/americanlawyer/tal200709/?pg=5|title=Error|website=www.americanlawyer-digital.com|url-access=subscription |page=5}}</ref>  The "swap" and the ensuing negotiations, which lasted for many years, have been referred to as the most complex real estate transaction in human history because of the complexity of the issues involved, the many stakeholders, and the difficulty of reaching consensus.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Scott|last=Raab|title=Construction of World Trade Center|magazine=Esquire|date=May 24, 2007}}</ref>

===Criticism of progress===
An episode of [[CBS]]'s ''60 Minutes'' in 2010 focused on the lack of progress at Ground Zero, particularly on the lack of completion dates for a majority of the buildings, the main tower, [[One World Trade Center]] (previously known as the Freedom Tower)'s having undergone three different designs, and the delays and monetary expense involved.  Investor [[Larry Silverstein]] said the Port Authority's estimated completion date for the entire site was 2037, and billions of dollars had already been spent on the project, even though Ground Zero "is still a hole in the ground". During an interview for the episode, Larry Silverstein said: "I am the most frustrated person in the world...I'm seventy-eight years of age; I want to see this thing done in my lifetime".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/02/18/60minutes/main6220282.shtml |title=Developer: Ground Zero a National Disgrace - 60 Minutes: Eight Years and Billions of Dollars Later, Part of 9/11 Site is Still Just a Big Hole |publisher=CBS News |date=February 18, 2010 |page=1}}</ref>  However, it was noted that in early 2011, all five office towers of the World Trade Center had begun construction.

The social center of the old World Trade Center included a spectacular restaurant on the 107th Floor, called [[Windows on the World]], and its Greatest Bar in the World; these were tourist attractions in their own right, and a social gathering spot for people who worked in the towers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ny.eater.com/2013/9/11/6547477/windows-on-the-world-new-yorks-sky-high-restaurant|title=Windows on the World, New York's Sky-High Restaurant|first=Greg|last=Morabito|date=September 11, 2013|website=Eater NY}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/02/world-trade-center-observatory-views-photos_n_3001052.html |work=Huffington Post |title=PHOTOS: The Stunning Views Atop One World Trade Center |date=April 2, 2013}}</ref> This restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the United States, called "Windows on the World Wine School", run by wine personality [[Kevin Zraly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/food-for-men/windows-on-the-world-september-11|title=Cocktails Before the Collapse|date=September 10, 2016|website=esquire.com}}</ref> Despite numerous assurances that these local landmarks and global attractions would be rebuilt,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20010917/SUB/109170715#|title=Owner vows to reopen Windows On The World|publisher= Crain's New York|date=September 17, 2001|author=Louise Kramer|access-date=July 23, 2017}}</ref> the Port Authority scrapped plans to rebuild these WTC attractions, which has outraged some observers.<ref>{{cite news |journal=Gothamist |date=March 8, 2011 |title=WTC Scraps Windows on the World Plan |url=http://gothamist.com/2011/03/08/wtc_scraps_windows_on_the_world_pla.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313083936/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/08/wtc_scraps_windows_on_the_world_pla.php |archive-date=March 13, 2013 }}</ref>

===Towers===
[[One World Trade Center]] (previously coined the "Freedom Tower" by Governor Pataki) is the centerpiece of Libeskind's design. The building rises to {{convert|1368|ft|m}}, the height of the original World Trade Center north tower, and its antenna rises to the symbolic height of 1,776 feet (541 m). This height refers to 1776, the year in which the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] was signed. The tower was a collaboration between Studio Daniel Libeskind and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill architect [[David Childs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wtc.com/about/freedom-tower |title=Freedom Tower: About the Building |access-date=January 21, 2008 |publisher=Silverstein Properties}}</ref> Childs acted as the design architect and project manager for the tower, and Daniel Libeskind collaborated on the concept and schematic design.<ref>{{cite news |title=Libeskind and Silverstein reach an agreement for WTC site |first=Kevin |last=Lerner |magazine=[[Archit.
