'''John McKee Spratt Jr.''' (born November 1, 1942) is an American politician who was the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|SC|5}} from 1983 to 2011. The 5th Congressional District covers all or part of 14 counties in north-central [[South Carolina]]. The largest cities are [[Rock Hill, South Carolina|Rock Hill]] and [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]]. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. 

Spratt was the dean of the South Carolina congressional delegation, chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on the Budget]], and the second ranking Democrat on the [[U.S. House Committee on Armed Services]], where he served on three subcommittees: Oversight and Investigations, Strategic Forces, and Air and Land Forces. In addition to his committee work, he co-chaired the Textile Caucus, the Bearing Caucus, and the Nuclear Energy Caucus. 

On November 2, 2010, he lost his seat to Republican challenger [[Mick Mulvaney]].

==Early life, education and career==
Spratt was born in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], and raised in [[York, South Carolina]]. His father founded the Bank of [[Fort Mill]] and the [[York, South Carolina|York]] law firm where he would eventually practice. His only sibling is Jane Bratton Spratt McColl, wife of [[Hugh McColl]], former chairman and chief executive officer of [[Bank of America]] Corporation.<ref>[https://guides.law.sc.edu/MemoryHoldTheDoor-VolumeII/SprattJohnMcKee "Memory Hold the Door: John McKee Spratt, 1907-1973," University of South Carolina School of Law, law.sc.edu, 12 June 2008.<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

After graduating from [[York Comprehensive High School|York High School]], he earned a [[bachelor's degree]] degree in history from [[Davidson College]] in 1964. He served as student body president at both schools. Spratt then earned an [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree in philosophy, politics, and economics from [[Oxford University]] ([[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]]) in 1966 while studying on a [[Marshall Scholarship]], and an [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]] degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1969.

Spratt was a captain in the [[United States Army|Army]] from 1969 to 1971, serving in the Operations Analysis Group in the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) at the [[the Pentagon|Pentagon]], and was awarded the [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]].<ref>[http://spratt.house.gov/about/biography.shtml Biography of Congressman John Spratt, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324231235/http://spratt.house.gov/about/biography.shtml |date=2010-03-24 }}</ref>

Spratt returned to York in 1971 to practice at the law firm of Spratt, McKeown, and Spratt. He was county attorney and school board attorney, and president of the Bank of [[Fort Mill, South Carolina|Fort Mill]]. He also ran a small insurance agency and owned a farm in Fort Mill.  

Spratt married Jane Stacy of [[Filbert, South Carolina]].  They have three daughters named Susan, Sarah, and Catherine. They also have five grandchildren named Lily, Jack, Max, Grace, and James. Spratt has long been a member of [[Presbyterianism|First Presbyterian Church]] in [[York, South Carolina]]. He has also been active in the [[United Way of America|United Way]] and other civic and charity organizations. 

==U.S. House of Representatives==

For his work in Congress, Spratt won praise from [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]'s newspaper ''[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]'', which called him "one of his party's most reliable 'bridges' to the Republican side."<ref>"Spratt Finds Bridge Over Party Divide," The State, Columbia, SC, 1 April 1996.</ref>  ''[[National Journal]]'' featured him on its cover as "a stand-out" in Congress, comparing his legislative skills to the "best infielders in baseball."<ref>"Congress's Designated Hitters," National Journal, 28 January 1989, No. 4, p.174.</ref> In a [[Washingtonian (magazine)|''Washingtonian'']] magazine survey, Congressional staff voted him a "Workhorse" and "House Member I'd Like to See Win the Presidency in 2008."<ref>[http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/mediapolitics/1666.html "Best and Worst of Congress," Washingtonian, 01 September 2006, Vol. 41, No. 12.]</ref>

Spratt co-authored the [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]], putting the federal budget in surplus for the first time in 30 years.<ref>[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/ls968.htm "Joint Statement of Lawrence H. Summers, Secretary of the Treasury, and Jacob J. Lew, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, on Budget Results for Fiscal Year 2000," U.S. Department of the Treasury, 24 October 2000.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517233616/http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/ls968.htm |date=17 May 2010 }}</ref> In 2003, Spratt engineered an amendment which shifted $30 million in the defense appropriations bill to the Airborne Laser program.<ref>Costa, K.

In the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]], Spratt supported legislation such as the
[[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], extension of unemployment benefits, increased infrastructure and labor workforce funding, increased federal financial aid packages, increased home foreclosure and small business assistance, reduction in estate taxes for 99.8 percent of estates, clean water legislation, health insurance reform, expansion of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], reforming of medicare payment plans, clean energy legislation, pay as you go legislation, defense authorization for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, increased VA hospital investment.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/legvotes.html |title=Roll Call Votes, Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives. |access-date=2010-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718135530/http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/legvotes.html |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On March 21, 2010, Spratt joined a majority of his House colleagues in approving H.R. 3590, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], the Senate version of the health care reform bill.  As chairman of the House Budget Committee, he made the floor motion which led to the vote on the bill.  "I was where the action was when the bill had to be called from the clerk's desk," he told [[The Herald (Rock Hill)|''The Herald'']], a [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]] newspaper.  "It was like sharing a moment in history." <ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll165.xml Final Vote Results For Roll Call 165] Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives, 21 March 2010.</ref>

On March 24, 2010, Spratt was appointed to the president's [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform]].  In reporting on the appointment, [[Dow Jones Newswires]] called Spratt "one of the staunchest fiscal conservatives among House Democrats."<ref>[http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news-story.aspx?storyid=201003241944dowjonesdjonline000612&title=correctpelosi-names-last-3-members-of-fiscal-commission Corey Boles, Dow Jones Newswires, in NASDAQ.com, 24 March 2010.]</ref> One of Spratts' last acts in Congress was helping compile a 65-page report on fixing the country's financial deficit.<ref>{{Cite web|last=All Things Considered|first=|date=2010-12-03|title=Spratt Says Farewell To House|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/03/131790977/Spratt-Says-Farewell-To-House|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-27|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
Spratt became active in Democratic politics at an early age, and was elected delegate to the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]]. Spratt was first elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1982, succeeding fellow Democrat [[Kenneth Lamar Holland|Kenneth Holland]].  He was reelected 13 more times.  Although parts of the district were becoming friendlier to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates at the national level, the GOP was more or less nonexistent in this part of South Carolina at the local level for some time. As evidence, Spratt only faced a Republican opponent twice from 1984 to 1992, both of those times winning easily.  In 1994, however, Spratt was nearly defeated by Republican Larry Bigham, only surviving by 6,300 votes.  He defeated Bigham by a slightly larger margin in 1996, but from 1998 to 2008 Spratt usually won with relatively little difficulty due to his popularity and campaigning skills.<ref>Galderisi, Paul. Redistricting in the New Millennium, p. 194. (2005). Retrieved from<nowiki/>http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~bgrofman/140%20Grofman%20and%20Brunell.%20%202005%20%20The%20Art%20of%20the%20Dummymander....pdf</ref>

Spratt typically stayed out of presidential politics while he was a congressman because the national party was not popular in his district. For instance, he did not endorse any candidates in the [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kuhn|first=David Paul|date=2008-01-22|title=Congress' only white S.C.

Orszag]], whom Spratt had helped hire as the director of the Congressional Budget Office.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2008-12-05|title=John Spratt - Power Broker|url=https://www.wbtv.com/story/9467417/cover-story-john-spratt-power-broker|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-27|website=wbtv|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== 2010 ===
In 2010, John Spratt's re-election chances was the subject of numerous articles. He was seen as particularly vulnerable due to his ties with the Democratic party leadership, his district's double-digit unemployment rate, and the district's growing Republican base.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hook|first=Janet|date=2010-08-26|title=Defying an anti-incumbent mood, a veteran Democrat runs on his record|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-aug-26-la-na-south-carolina-20100827-story.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-25|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> He was defeated that year by [[Mick Mulvaney]] by a margin of 55 percent to 45 percentâ€”one of the largest margins of defeat for an incumbent in the [[2010 United States elections|2010 cycle.]] 

Mulvaney successfully weaponized Spratt's bipartisan credentials against him during the election.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2010-12-01|title=Packing Up the Past|url=https://www.rollcall.com/2010/12/01/packing-up-the-past/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Roll Call|language=en}}</ref> He lamented that Spratt was no longer fiscally conservative like he had once been in 1997 when he helped balance the nation's budget and criticized his relationship with [[Nancy Pelosi]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Seelye|first=Katharine Q.|date=2010-10-13|title=After 28 Years, a Congressman on the Ropes (Published 2010)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/us/politics/13spratt.html|access-date=2020-11-24|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The National Republican Congressional Committee called John Spratt an "amnesiac" and stated he was forgetting what was going on in Washington.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-05-18|title=Republicans suggest Spratt losing his memory|url=https://wach.com/news/local/republicans-suggest-spratt-losing-his-memory-10-23-2015|access-date=2020-11-25|website=WACH}}</ref> Notably, [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] flew into Charlotte with Spratt on Air Force One during the campaign.<ref>Will U.S. Rep Spratt be helped by Obama photo op?

(November 26, 2020). </ref> was among three Democratic house chairmen who lost that year to [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party candidates.]] 

==Personal life==
Spratt was diagnosed in 2010 with [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Taylor|first=Jessica|date=2010-03-03|title=Spratt in early stages of Parkinson's disease|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2010/03/spratt-in-early-stages-of-parkinsons-disease-035204|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-24|website=POLITICO|language=en}}</ref> Since his departure from Congress, Spratt has served as Visiting Distinguished Professor of Public Policy at [[Winthrop University]].<ref>http://www.winthrop.edu/cas/faculty/default.aspx?id=19820</ref> He also serves on the Board of Directors of the [[Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget]].<ref>[http://www.crfb.org/board-members Board Members, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget]</ref>
