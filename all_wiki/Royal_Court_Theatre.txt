The '''Royal Court Theatre''', at different times known as the '''Court Theatre''', the '''New Chelsea Theatre''', and the '''Belgravia Theatre''', is a [[West End Theatre#London's non-commercial theatres|non-commercial West End theatre]] on [[Sloane Square]], in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]], London, England. In 1956 it was acquired by and remains the home of the [[English Stage Company]] and is notable for its contributions to contemporary theatre.

== History ==
=== The first theatre ===
The first theatre on Lower George Street, off Sloane Square, was the converted Nonconformist '''Ranelagh Chapel''', opened as a theatre in 1870 under the name '''The New Chelsea Theatre'''. [[Marie Litton]] became its manager in 1871, hiring [[Walter Emden]] to remodel the interior, and it was renamed the '''Court Theatre'''.{{efn|During mid-1870, it was briefly called the "Belgravia" Theatre, but all of W. S. Gilbert's pieces presented at the theatre, beginning in 1871, were publicised as playing at the "Court Theatre".}}

Several of [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s early plays were staged here, including ''[[Randall's Thumb]]'', ''[[Creatures of Impulse]]'' (with music by [[Alberto Randegger]]), ''Great Expectations'' (adapted from the [[Dickens]] novel), and ''On Guard'' (all in 1871); ''[[The Happy Land]]'' (1873, with [[Gilbert Abbott à Beckett]]; Gilbert's most controversial play); ''The Wedding March'', translated from ''Un Chapeau de Paille d'Italie'' by [[Eugène Marin Labiche]] (1873); ''The Blue-Legged Lady'', translated from ''La Dame aux Jambes d'Azur'' by Labiche and Marc-Michel (1874); and ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875). By 1878, management of the theatre was shared by [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]] and [[W. H. Kendal]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ainger|2002|p=168}}</ref>

Further alterations were made in 1882 by Alexander Peebles, after which its capacity was 728 (including stalls and boxes, dress circle and balcony, amphitheatre, and gallery).<ref name=socialhistory>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=28709#s9 ''Social history: Social and cultural activities, A History of the County of Middlesex'']: Volume 12: Chelsea (2004), pp. 166–76. Date accessed: 22 March 2007.</ref> After that, [[Arthur Cecil]] (who had joined the theatre's company in 1881) was co-manager of the theatre with John Clayton.<ref name=dnb>Knight, Joseph, rev.

=== The current theatre: 1888–1952 ===
The present building was built on the east side of Sloane Square, replacing the earlier building, and opened on 24 September 1888 as the '''New Court Theatre'''. Designed by Walter Emden and [[Bertie Crewe]], it is constructed of fine red brick, moulded brick, and a stone facade in free Italianate style. Originally the theatre had a capacity of 841 in the stalls, dress circle, amphitheatre, and a gallery.

Cecil and Clayton yielded management of the theatre to [[Mrs. John Wood]] and Arthur Chudleigh in 1887, although Cecil continued acting in their company (and others) until 1895.<ref name=dnb /> The first production in the new building was a play by [[Sydney Grundy]] titled ''Mamma'', starring [[Mrs. John Wood]] and John Hare, with [[Arthur Cecil]] and [[Eric Lewis (actor)|Eric Lewis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New Court Theatre|newspaper=The Times|date=25 September 1888|page=9}}</ref> By the end of the century, the theatre was again called the "Royal Court Theatre".<ref>[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/RoyalCourtTheatreLondon.htm#present "The Royal Court Theatre, Sloane Square, London: The New Court Theatre"], ArthurLloyd.co.uk, accessed 19 December 2017</ref>

[[Harley Granville-Barker]] managed the theatre for the first few years of the 20th century, and [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s plays were produced at the New Court for a period. It ceased to be used as a theatre in 1932, but was used as a [[movie theater|cinema]] from 1935 to 1940, until [[World War II]] bomb damage closed it.<ref name=socialhistory />

=== The English Stage Company ===
The interior was reconstructed by Robert Cromie, and the number of seats was reduced to under 500. The theatre re-opened in 1952.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mackintosh|first1=Iain|last2=Sell|first2=Michael|title=Curtains!!! ; or, A new life for old theatres|location=Eastbourne|publisher=John Offord|date=1982|p=155}} See Plate 15.</ref> [[George Devine]] was appointed artistic director at the suggestion of [[Oscar Lewenstein]], one of the founders of the English Stage Company. [[Greville Poke]], another co-founder was appointed Honorary Secretary of the ESC in October 1954.<ref name="The Royal Court Theatre and the Modern Stage">{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Philip|title=The Royal Court Theatre and the Modern Stage|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Library|isbn=0-521-47962-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/royalcourttheatr0000robe/page/20 20–21]|url=https://archive.org/details/royalcourttheatr0000robe/page/20}}</ref> The ESC opened at the Royal Court in 1956 as a subsidised theatre producing new British and foreign plays, together with some classical revivals.<ref>[https://royalcourttheatre.com/about/history Royal Court Theatre: History]</ref> Devine aimed to create a writers' theatre, seeking to discover new writers and produce serious contemporary works. Devine produced the new company's third production in 1956, [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'', a play by one of the [[angry young men]]. The director was [[Tony Richardson]]. Osborne followed ''Look Back in Anger'' with ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]]'', with [[Laurence Olivier]] in the lead as Archie Rice, a play the actor effectively commissioned from the playwright. Significantly, although it was quickly reversed, the artistic board of the ESC initially rejected the play. Two members of the board were in agreement in opposing ''The Entertainer''. The verse dramatist [[Ronald Duncan]], the third co-founder of the ESC, disliked the work of Osborne according to Osborne biographer [[John Heilpern]],<ref name="Heilpern216">Heilpern, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hBfYDEupYC&pg=PA216 ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us''], London: Vintage, 2007 [2006], p.216; [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/mar/06/comedy1 "'It's me, isn't it?'"], ''The Guardian'', 6 March 2007 (extract)</ref>{{efn|Despite Heilpern's claim, Duncan seems to have recognised the qualities of ''Look Back in Anger''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Yael|last=Zarhy-Levo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_xMBGEEi-kC&pg=PA31|title=The Making of Theatrical Reputations: Studies from the Modern London Theatre|location=Iowa City|publisher=University of Iowa Press|date=2008|page=31}}</ref>}} while Lewenstein, a former [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist]],<ref name="ODNB">Murphy, Robert.

In the mid-1960s, the ESC became involved in issues of [[Censorship in the United Kingdom|censorship]]. Their premiere productions of Osborne's ''[[A Patriot for Me]]'' and ''[[Saved (play)|Saved]]'' by [[Edward Bond]] (both 1965) necessitated the theatre turning itself into a 'private members club' to circumvent the [[Lord Chamberlain]], formally responsible for the licensing of plays until the [[Theatres Act 1968]]. The ''[[succès de scandale]]'' of the two plays helped to bring about the abolition of [[Lord Chamberlain's Office#Theatre censorship|theatre censorship]] in the UK.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} During the period of Devine's directorship, besides Osborne and Bond, the Royal Court premiered works by [[Arnold Wesker]], [[John Arden]], [[Ann Jellicoe]] and [[N.F. Simpson]]. Subsequent Artistic Directors of the Royal Court premiered work by [[Christopher Hampton]], [[Athol Fugard]], [[Howard Brenton]], [[Caryl Churchill]], [[Hanif Kureishi]], [[Sarah Daniels]], [[Errol John]], [[Timberlake Wertenbaker]], [[Martin Crimp]], [[Sarah Kane]], [[Sylvia Wynter]], [[Mark Ravenhill]], [[Martin McDonagh]], [[Simon Stephens]], [[Leo Butler]], [[Polly Stenham]] and [[Nick Payne]]. Early seasons included new international plays by [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Marguerite Duras]]. In addition to the 400-seat [[proscenium arch]] Theatre Downstairs, the much smaller studio Theatre Upstairs was opened in 1969, at the time a 63-seat facility.<ref name=socialhistory /><ref>[http://www.behindthearras.com/Reviewspr/reviewsPRJanFeb2010/RockyHorrorG02-10.html 63 seat Theatre Upstairs]</ref> ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' premiered there in 1973. The theatre was [[listed building|Grade II listed]] in June 1972.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090621135451/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=2&id=423994 English Heritage listing details] accessed 28 April 2007</ref>

[[File: royalcourttheatre.jpg|thumb|upright|The Royal Court Theatre at dusk in 2007]]
Though the main auditorium and the façade were attractive, the remainder of the building provided poor facilities for both audience and performers, and the stalls and understage often flooded throughout the 20th century. By the early 1990s, the theatre had deteriorated dangerously and was threatened with closure in 1995. The Royal Court received a grant of £16.2&nbsp;million from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] and the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council]] for redevelopment, and beginning in 1996, under the artistic directorship of [[Stephen Daldry]], it was completely rebuilt, except for the façade and the intimate auditorium. The architects for this were [[Haworth Tompkins]]. The theatre reopened in February 2000, with the 380-seat [[Jerwood Foundation|Jerwood]] Theatre Downstairs, and the 85-seat studio theatre, now the Jerwood Theatre Upstairs. Since 1994, a new generation of playwrights debuting at the theatre has included [[Joe Penhall]], [[Sarah Kane]], [[Mark Ravenhill]], [[Roy Williams (playwright)|Roy Williams]] amongst others.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Since the 1990s, the Royal Court has placed an emphasis on the development and production of international plays. By 1993, the British Council had begun its support of the International Residency programme (which started in 1989 as the Royal Court International Summer School), and more recently the [[Genesis Foundation (arts charity)|Genesis Foundation]] has also supported the production of international plays. The theatre received a 1999 International Theatre Institute award.<ref>[https://royalcourttheatre.com/international/ International Department], Royal Court Theatre</ref> In May 2008 The English Stage Company presented ''The Ugly One'' by [[Marius von Mayenburg]] at the "Contact International Theatre Festival" in [[Poland]].<ref>[http://teatr.torun.pl/_portal/12084172374806fbd51b077/Kontakt_2008.html Contact International Theatre Festival 2008] accessed 24 May 2008</ref>

=== Controversy over ''Seven Jewish Children'' ===
[[Caryl Churchill]]'s play ''[[Seven Jewish Children]]'' played at the theatre in 2009. Many Jewish leaders and journalists criticised the play as [[antisemitic]].<ref name=Symons>Symons, Leon.
