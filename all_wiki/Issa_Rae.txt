In 2007, Diop graduated from Stanford University with a Bachelor of Arts in African and [[African-American Studies]]. As a college student, she made music videos, wrote and directed plays, and created a mock reality series called ''Dorm Diaries'' for fun. At Stanford, Diop met [[Tracy Oliver]], who helped produce ''Awkward Black Girl'' and starred on the show as Nina.<ref name=StanfordAlumni-ABG-2012 />

After college, Diop received a theater fellowship at [[The Public Theater]] in New York City.<ref name=NYTimes-Magazine-2015 /> Oliver and Diop started taking classes together at the [[New York Film Academy]].

==Career==
===''Awkward Black Girl''===
{{main|Awkward Black Girl}}
Rae's web series ''[[Awkward Black Girl]]'' premiered on YouTube in 2011.<ref>Brown, S Tia (September 12, 2011). "Nerdy Girls Rock". ''Jet''. Vol. 120. Iss. 11. p. 31.</ref> The show follows the life of J (played by Rae) as she interacts with co-workers and love interests who place her in uncomfortable situations. The story is told through a first-person narrative as J usually reveals how she feels about her circumstances through voice-over or dream sequence.

The series eventually went viral through word of mouth, blog posts, and social media, resulting in mainstream media coverage and attention.<ref name=CNN-ABG-2011>{{cite news|last1=Whitfield|first1=Fredricka|title='Awkward Black Girl' web hit|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/living/2011/10/08/whitfield-issa-rae-interview.cnn|format=video interview|work=[[CNN]]|date=October 8, 2011}}</ref><ref name=PhillyTribune-ABG-2011>{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Stacy A.|title=Diverse Web series grows through social media|url=http://www.phillytrib.com/entertainment/diverse-web-series-grows-through-social-media/article_7da9523e-033d-5218-aef4-4b87d7655150.html|work=[[The Philadelphia Tribune]]|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|date=September 12, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Root-ABG-2011>{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Helena|title=Embracing the Awkward, One Webisode at a Time|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2011/07/awkward_black_girl_interview_issa_rae_talks_to_the_root/|work=[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]|date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> In an effort to fund the rest of the first season, Rae and producer Tracy Oliver decided to raise money for the series through Kickstarter. On August 11, 2011 they were awarded $56,269 from 1,960 donations and released the rest of season one on Rae's YouTube channel.<ref name=Kickstarter-ABG-2011>{{cite web|title=Update 1: Update Video: Thank You for Over $40K Raised!|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1996857943/the-misadventures-of-awkward-black-girl/posts/106068|website=The Misadventures of AWKWARD Black Girl|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|date=August 8, 2011}}</ref>

Rae eventually partnered with [[Pharrell]] and premiered season two of the series on his YouTube channel, ''iamOTHER''.<ref name="PinkNewBlog-IAmOther-2012">{{cite news|last1=Shannon|title=Pharrell Williams Teams Up With Awkward Black Girl & Launches New Brand|url=http://www.pinkisthenewblog.com/2012-06-15/pharrell-williams-teams-up-with-awkward-black-girl-launches-new-brand|work=[[Trent Vanegas|Pink is the New Blog]]|date=June 15, 2012}}</ref> Rae also began releasing other content on her original channel, predominantly created by and starring people of color.<ref name=NYT-ABG-Review-2012>{{cite news|last1=Caramanica|first1=Jon|title=Issa Rae and 'Awkward Black Girl' Are Breaking Ground|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/arts/television/issa-rae-and-awkward-black-girl-are-breaking-ground.htm|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 13, 2012}}</ref>

In 2013, ''Awkward Black Girl'' won a [[Shorty Awards|Shorty]] award for Best Web Show. Rae created ''Awkward Black Girl'' because she felt the Hollywood stereotypes of African-American women were limiting and she could not relate to them:

<blockquote>I've always had an issue with the [assumption] that people of color, and black people especially, aren't relatable. I know we are.<ref>Sherman, S.  (2015). Issa Rae, "Making The black Experience Relatable". ''Sun Reporter'', 9.</ref></blockquote>

By using YouTube as her forum, Rae was able to have autonomy of her work because she writes, films, produces, and edits most of her work. Rae's other shows—''Ratchet Piece Theater'', ''The "F" Word'', ''Roomieloverfriends'', and ''[[The Choir (web series)|The Choir]]'', among others—also focus on African-American experiences that are often not portrayed in the mainstream media.<ref name="THR-CreativityRoundtable-2016">{{cite news|last1=Favreau|first1=Jon|title=Creativity Roundtable: Lin-Manuel Miranda, Donald Glover, Issa Rae and Damien Chazelle in One Epic Conversation|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/lin-manuel-miranda-donald-glover-issa-rae-damien-chazelle-one-epic-conversation-956697|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2016|format=Video roundtable includes transcript}}</ref>
