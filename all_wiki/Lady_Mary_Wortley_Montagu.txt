'''Lady Mary Wortley Montagu''' (née '''Pierrepont'''; 15 May 1689{{spnd}}21 August 1762) was an English [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], writer, and poet. Lady Mary is today chiefly remembered for her letters, particularly her letters from travels to the [[Ottoman Empire]], as wife to the British ambassador to Turkey, which Billie Melman described as "the very first example of a secular work by a woman about the Muslim Orient".<ref>Melman, Billie. ''Women's Orients: English Women and the Middle East, 1718–1918''. University of Michigan Press. 1992. Print.</ref> Aside from her writing, Lady Mary is also known for introducing and advocating for [[smallpox]] [[inoculation]] to Britain after her return from Turkey. Her writings address and challenge the hindering contemporary social attitudes towards women and their intellectual and social growth.

==Early life==
[[File:Lady Mary Wortley Montagu with her son Edward by Jean Baptiste Vanmour.jpg|thumb|Mary Wortley Montagu with her son [[Edward Wortley Montagu (traveller)|Edward]], by [[Jean-Baptiste van Mour]]]]
Lady Mary Pierrepont was born on 15 May 1689 in at [[Holme Pierrepont Hall]] in Nottinghamshire and [[baptism|baptised]] on 26 May 1689 at [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St. Paul's Church]] in [[Covent Garden]], London.<ref>Grundy, Isobel. ''Lady Mary Wortley Montague'', p. 5. Oxford University Press, 1999. Print.</ref> She was the eldest child of [[Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull]] (c.1655–1726), and his first wife Mary Feilding (d.1692), the only daughter of the [[William Feilding, 3rd Earl of Denbigh|third Earl of Denbigh]] (d.1692). Lady Mary had three younger siblings, two girls, Frances and Evelyn, and a boy, William.<ref name="grundy">{{cite ODNB |last=Grundy |first=Isobel |title=Montagu, Lady Mary Wortley|id=19029 |freearticle=y}}</ref>

Lady Mary was a bright, free-spirited child who dreamed of greatness. She wrote in her diary, "I am going to write a history so uncommon."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Halsband |first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=2}}</ref> Aged seven, members of the newly formed [[Kit-Cat Club]], a group of fashionable men, nominated her as the subject of their toast to the beauty of the season, and they had her name engraved on the glass goblet used for this purpose.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bradley|first=Rose|url=https://archive.org/stream/englishhousewife00braduoft#page/204/mode/2up|title=The English Housewife in the Seventeenth & Eighteenth Centuries|publisher=E.

However, misfortune occurred. Her mother, who she thought would have supported her aspirations, died. Then her paternal grandmother Elizabeth Pierrepont raised Mary and her siblings until she died when Mary was eight years old.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paston|first=George|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu And Her Times|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|year=1907|isbn=978-1333260675|pages=2}}</ref> Then, after Mrs. Pierrepont's death, Mary was passed to the care of her father, who did not believe he was obliged to assist with her education.<ref name=":0" />

==Education==
Mary Wortley Montagu's education was divided between a governess and the use of the library at the family property Thoresby Hall. According to Lady Mary, the governess gave her ‘one of the worst [education] in the world’ by teaching Lady Mary "superstitious tales and false notions."<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=5}}</ref> To supplement the instruction of a despised governess, Lady Mary used the well-furnished library to "steal" her education by hiding in the library from 10am-2pm and "every afternoon from four to eight."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=4-7}}</ref> She taught herself Latin, a language usually reserved for men at the time. She secretly got a hold of a "Latin dictionary and grammar" and by the age of thirteen, her handling with the language was on par to most men.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=7}}</ref>  Furthermore, she was also a voracious reader. She jotted the list of characters and titles she read into a notebook.<ref name=":2" /> Some of the works she read included "plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, Dryden, Rowe, Lee Otway" and French and English romances, including "''Grand Cyrus'', ''Pharamond'', ''Almahide'', and ''Parthenissa''."<ref name=":2" /> By 1705, at the age of fourteen or fifteen, Mary Pierrepont had written two albums entitled "Poems, Songs &c" filled with poetry, a brief [[epistolary novel]], and a prose-and-verse romance modelled after Aphra Behn's ''Voyage to the Isle of Love'' (1684).<ref name=":2" /> She also corresponded with two bishops, [[Thomas Tenison]] and Gilbert Burnet, who supplemented the instruction of the governess. Overall, Mary impressed her father, who was not a scholar, with her progress.<ref name=":3" />

== Marriage and embassy to Ottoman Empire ==

=== Engagement ===
By 1710, Lady Mary had two possible suitors to choose from: [[Edward Wortley Montagu (diplomat)|Edward Wortley Montagu]] (born 8 February 1678) and Clotworthy Skeffington.<ref name="biog">Grundy, Isobel. ''Lady Mary Wortley Montagu''. Oxford University Press, 1999. Print.</ref> The friendship between Lady Mary and Edward Wortley Montagu, the son of Sidney Wortley Montagu, began through Edward's younger sister Anne Wortley.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=10}}</ref> In London, Anne and Lady Mary met frequently at social functions and exchanged visits to each other's homes.<ref name=":4" /> They also communicated through writing, in which they filled their letters with "trivial gossip" and "effusive compliments."<ref name=":4" /> After Anne died in November 1709, Lady Mary began conversing with Anne's brother Edward Wortley Montagu.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=11}}</ref> Lady Mary often met Edward at "friends’ houses" and "at Court."<ref name=":5" /> On 28 March 1710, she wrote the first letter she addressed to Edward.<ref name=":5" /> Lady Mary corresponded with Edward Wortley Montagu via letters until 2 May 1711 without her father's permission.<ref name=":5" />

Keeping up with their communication became harder when Lady Mary's father bought a house at Acton, a suburban village famous for its mineral springs.<ref name=":5" /> Lady Mary hated the house because it was ‘dull and disagreeable,’ and it did not have a library in it.<ref name=":5" /> A few weeks after moving, Lady Mary had the measles, and she asked her maid to write Edward a letter to tell him about the illness.<ref name=":5" /> Soon, there were misunderstandings between Edward and Lady Mary. Edward hurried to Acton.<ref name=":5" /> There, he left a note, revealing his love: "I should be overjoyed to hear your Beauty is very much impaired, could I be pleased with anything that would give you displeasure, for it would lessen the number of Admirers."<ref name=":5" /> In response, she scolded his indiscretion by saying, "Forgive and forget me."<ref name=":5" /> Then, in his reply, Edward stated that "he would deal with her father if he were sure they could be happy together."<ref name=":5" /> This reply helped Lady Mary forget her irritation. Lady Mary in Acton and Edward in London kept writing to each other until the early summer of 1710.<ref name=":5" />

Lady Mary's primary concern with her engagement was financial, not romantic. Lady Mary denied transient emotions guiding her life: "I can esteem, I can be a friend, but I don’t know whether I can love."<ref name=":5" /> Then, after setting forth all her terms, including her deference, she warned to Edward that "Make no answer to this, if you can like me on my own terms" and that his proposals not be made for her.<ref name=":5" /> However, these correspondences soon endangered Edward. In one particular letter, Edward wrote, "Her being better in 1710, the consequence of its being known that I write to her."<ref name=":5" /> A servant in Lady Mary's household found this letter and gave it to her father; this letter put her father "in the utmost rage."<ref name=":5" /> However, Wortley was flattered that Lady Mary "had given the father as ‘an artifice to bring the affair to a proper conclusion.’"<ref name=":5" /> The next day, Wortley called Lady Mary’s father about a formal proposal.<ref name=":5" /> Mary's father, now Marquess of Dorchester had insisted on one condition in the marriage contract: "that Wortley’s estate be entailed on the first son born to him."<ref name=":5" /> However, Wortley refused to do this as it would require £10, 000.<ref name=":5" />

Consequently, in order to convince Lady Mary's father, Edward thought of publishing the marriage contract in the ''Tatler'', a British journal.<ref name=":5" /> On the ''Tatler’s'' issue of 18 July, Wortley wrote the following: "Her first lover has ten to one against him. The very hour after he has opened his heart and his rent rolls he is made no other use of but to raise her price…While the poor lover very innocently waits, till the plenipotentiaries at the inns of court have debated about the alliance, all the partisans of the lady throw difficulties in the way, till other offers come in; and the man who came first is not put in possession, until she has been refused by half the town."<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=13}}</ref> These arguments did not persuade Lord Dorchester.<ref name=":6" /> Even though these negotiations reached an impasse, Lady Mary and Edward continued corresponding with each other.{{cn|date=August 2020}} 

In the end of March 1711, Lady Mary's father intended on her friendship with Wortley.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=20}}</ref> Her father summoned her to a conference, forced her to promise to not to write, and hustled her to West Dean.<ref name=":7" /> However, Lady Mary broke her promise to tell Wortley about her rights and duty: "Had you had any real Affection for me, you would have long go applied yourself to him, from whose hand only you can receive me."<ref name=":7" /> After their exchanges of disagreements and realizing she did not like him, he realized their friendship must end.<ref name=":7" /> On 2 May, he replied, "Adieu, Dearest L[ady] M[ary]. This once be assur’d you will not deceive me. I expect no answer."<ref name=":7" /> Consequently, Lady Mary did not respond that summer.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489 |pages=21}}</ref> In that same summer, her father Lord Dorchester decided to find a husband other than Edward Wortley Montagu for his daughter.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lewis|first=Melville|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Her Life and Letters (1689–1762)|last2=Montagu|first2=Mary Wortley|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1925|isbn=978-1419129087|pages=57}}</ref>

Lady Mary's father pressured her to marry Clotworthy Skeffington, the heir to the Irish Viscount Massereene.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=23}}</ref> Skeffington's marriage contract included "an allowance of £500 a year as ‘pin-money,’ and £1,200 a year if he died."<ref name=":8" /> However, she rejected him. Thus, to avoid marriage to Skeffington, she eloped with Montagu. In a letter to Wortley, she wrote, "He [my father] will have a thousand plausible reasons for being irreconcilable, and ‘tis very probable the world will be on his side…I shall come to you with only a night-gown and petticoat, and that is all you will get with me. I told a lady of my friends what I intended to do. You will think her a very good friend when I tell you she has proffered to lend us her house if we would come there the first night…If you determine to go to that lady’s house, you had better come with a coach and six at seven o’clock to-morrow."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lewis|first=Melville|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Her Life and Letters (1689–1762)|last2=Montagu|first2=Mary Wortley|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1925|isbn=978-1419129087|pages=62}}</ref> The marriage license is dated 17 August 1712, and the marriage probably took place on 23 August 1712 and the marriage occurred at Salisbury on 15 October 1712.<ref name="biog" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=O'Loughlin|first=Katrina|title=Women, Writing, and Travel in the Eighteenth Century|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2018|isbn=978-1107088528|pages=33}}</ref>

=== Early married life before travelling to the Ottoman Empire ===
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Edward Wortley Montagu spent the first years of their  married life in England.  She had a son, [[Edward Wortley Montagu (traveller)|Edward Wortley Montagu the younger]], named after his father Edward Wortley Montagu, on 16 May 1713, in London.<ref>Grundy, Isobel. ''Lady Mary Wortley Montagu''. Oxford University Press, 1999.</ref> On 13 October 1714, her husband accepted the post of Junior Commissioner of the Treasury. When Lady Mary joined him in London, her wit and beauty soon made her a prominent figure at court. She was among the society of George I and the Prince of Wales, and counted amongst her friends [[Maria, Lady Walpole|Molly Skerritt, Lady Walpole]], [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|John, Lord Hervey]], [[Mary Astell]], [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[John Gay]], and Abbé [[Antonio Schinella Conti]].<ref name="grundy" />

In December 1715, at the age of twenty-six, Lady Mary contracted [[smallpox]]. She survived, but while she was ill someone circulated the satirical "court eclogues" she had been writing. One of the poems was read as an attack on [[Caroline of Ansbach|Caroline, Princess of Wales]], in spite of the fact that the "attack" was voiced by a character who was herself heavily satirised.<ref name="biog" />

=== Husband's assignment to Constantinople ===
[[File:Mary Wortley Montagu by Charles Jervas, after 1716.jpg|thumb|Mary Wortley Montagu, by [[Charles Jervas]], after 1716]]

In 1716, Edward Wortley Montagu was appointed Ambassador at [[Constantinople]] to negotiate an end to the Austro-Turkish War.<ref name=":18">{{Cite book|last=O’ Quinn|first=Daniel|title=Engaging the Ottoman Empire: Vexed Medications, 1690–1815|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2019|isbn=978-1333260675|pages=166}}</ref> In August 1716, Lady Mary accompanied him to [[Vienna]], and thence to [[Adrianople]] and Constantinople. He was recalled in 1717, but they remained at Constantinople until 1718. While away from England, the Wortley Montagus had a daughter on 19 January 1718, who would grow up to be [[Mary Stuart, Countess of Bute|Mary, Countess of Bute]].<ref name="biog" /> After an unsuccessful delegation between Austria and the Ottoman Empire, they set sail for England via the Mediterranean, and reached London on 2 October 1718.<ref name="biog" /> In the same year, Austrians and the Turkish signed the Treaty of Passarowitz at the conclusion of the Austro-Turkish War.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=93}}</ref>

The story of this voyage and of her observations of Eastern life is told in ''[[Letters from Turkey]]'', a series of lively letters full of graphic descriptions; ''Letters'' is often credited as being an inspiration for subsequent female travelers and writers, as well as for much [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] art. During her visit she was sincerely charmed by the beauty and hospitality of the Ottoman women she encountered. She wrote about how different their fashion was in letters. In a letter to Lady Mar, she wrote: "They build certain fabrics of gauze on their heads, about a yard high, consisting of three or four stories, fortified with numberless yards of heavy ribbon…Their whalebone petticoats outdo ours by several yards’ circumference, and cover some acres of ground."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Montagu|first=Mary Wortley|title=Letters from the Levant during the Embassy to Constantinople|publisher=Arno Press|year=1971|isbn=978-0405027673|pages=36}}</ref>  Furthermore, she recorded her experiences in a [[Turkish bath]], which are reserved for both diversion and health.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Montagu|first=Mary Wortley|title=Letters from the Levant during the Embassy to Constantinople|publisher=Arno Press|year=1971|isbn=978-0405027673|pages=104}}</ref> In a letter, she wrote, "They [Ottoman women] generally take this diversion once a week, and stay there at least four or five hours, without getting cold immediately coming out of the hot bath into the cold room, which was surprising to me."<ref name=":19">{{Cite book|last=Montagu|first=Mary Wortley|title=Letters from the Levant during the Embassy to Constantinople|publisher=Arno Press|year=1971|isbn=978-0405027673|pages=108}}</ref> She also recorded a particularly amusing incident in which a group of Turkish women at a bath in [[Sofia]], horrified by the sight of the [[Bone (corsetry)|stays]] she was wearing, exclaimed that "they believed I was so locked up in that machine that it was not in my own power to open it, which contrivance they attributed to my husband."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Montagu, Mary Wortley |title=The Turkish embassy letters|date=2013|publisher=Broadview Press|others=Heffernan, Teresa, 1962–, O'Quinn, Daniel, 1962–|isbn=9781554810420|location=Peterborough, Ont.|pages=103|oclc=820133066}}</ref> Lady Mary wrote about misconceptions of previous travelers, specifically male travelers, had recorded about the religion, traditions and the treatment of women in the Ottoman Empire. Her gender and class status provided her with access to female spaces that were closed off to males. Her personal interactions with Ottoman women enabled her to provide, in her view, a more accurate account of Turkish women, their dress, habits, traditions, limitations and liberties, at times irrefutably more a critique of the Occident than a praise of the Orient.<ref name="biog" /> Montagu also carefully constructed Ottoman female spaces, and her own engagement with Ottoman women, as full of homoerotic desire, which is consistent with the gender and [[sexual fluidity]] that characterized much of her life and writings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beynon|first=John|date=2003|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's Sapphic Vision|journal=Imperial Desire: Dissident Sexualities and Colonial Literature|volume=University of Minneapolis Press, 2003|pages=21–43}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Marilyn|date=2006|title=Transgendered Perspectives on Premodern Sexualities|journal=SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500–1900|volume=46|issue=3|pages=585–600|doi=10.1353/sel.2006.0028}}</ref>

== Ottoman smallpox inoculation ==

[[File:Memorial to Lady Mary Wortley Montague in Lichfield Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Memorial to the Rt. Hon. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu erected in [[Lichfield Cathedral]] by Henrietta Inge.]]

=== Smallpox inoculation ===
In the 18th century, Europeans began an experiment known as ''inoculation or variolation'' to prevent, not cure the smallpox.<ref name=":14">{{Cite book|last=Lindemann|first=Mary|title=Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0521732567|pages=74}}</ref> Lady Mary Wortley Montagu defied convention, most memorably by introducing smallpox inoculation to Western medicine after witnessing it during her travels and stay in the Ottoman Empire. Previously, Lady Mary's brother had died of smallpox in 1713, and although Lady Mary recovered from the disease in 1715, it left her with a disfigured face.<ref name="Letters" /> In the Ottoman Empire, she visited the women in their segregated [[zenana]]s, a house for Muslims and Hindus, making friends and learning about Turkish customs.<ref name="Safe Smallpox Inoculations">Rosenhek, Jackie.''Safe Smallpox Inoculations''Doctor's Review: Medicine on the Move, Feb 2005. Web. 10 November 2015. [http://www.doctorsreview.com/history/feb05-history/ Safe Smallpox Inoculations].</ref> There in March 1717, she witnessed the practice of inoculation against [[smallpox]] – [[variolation]] – which she called engrafting, and wrote home about it in a number of her letters.<ref name="Letters" /><ref name=":15">{{Cite book|last=Lewis|first=Melville|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Her Life and Letters (1689–1762)|last2=Montagu|first2=Mary Wortley|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1925|isbn=978-1419129087|pages=135}}</ref> The most famous of these letters was her "Letter to a Friend" of 1 April 1717.  Variolation used live smallpox virus in the pus taken from a mild smallpox blister and introduced it into scratched skin of the arm or leg (the most usual spots) of a previously uninfected person to promote immunity to the disease.<ref>Rosenhek, Jackie. ''Safe Smallpox Inoculations'' Doctor's Review: Medicine on the Move, Feb 2005. Web. 10 November 2015. [http://www.doctorsreview.com/history/feb05-history/ Safe Smallpox Inoculations]</ref> Consequently, the inoculate would developed a milder case of smallpox than the one he/she might have contracted.<ref name=":14" />

Lady Mary was eager to spare her children, thus, in March 1718 she had her nearly five-year-old son, [[Edward Wortley Montagu (traveller)|Edward]], inoculated there with the help of Embassy surgeon [[Charles Maitland (physician)|Charles Maitland]].<ref name="Letters" /> In fact, her son was the "first English person to undergo the operation."<ref name=":15" /> In a letter to a friend in England, Montagu wrote, "There is a set of old women [here], who make it their business to perform the operation, every autumn…when then great heat is abated…thousands undergo this operation...[and there] is not one example of anyone that has died in it."<ref name=":16">{{Cite book|last=Lindemann|first=Mary|title=Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0521732567|pages=75}}</ref> Afterwards, she updated the status of Edward to her husband: "The Boy was engrafted last Tuesday, and is at this time singing and playing, and very impatient for his supper. I pray God my next may give as good an account of him."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Complete Letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, 1708–1720|last2=Montagu|first2=Mary Wortley|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1965|isbn=978-0198114468|pages=392}}</ref> On her return to London, she enthusiastically promoted the procedure, but encountered a great deal of resistance from the medical establishment, because it was an Oriental folk treatment process.<ref name="grundy" />

In April 1721, when a smallpox epidemic struck England, she had her daughter inoculated by Maitland, the same physician who had inoculated her son at the Embassy in Turkey, and publicised the event.<ref name="grundy" /> This was the first such operation done in Britain.<ref name="Letters" /> She persuaded [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the [[Princess of Wales]], to test the treatment. In August 1721, seven prisoners at [[Newgate Prison]] awaiting execution were offered the chance to undergo variolation instead of execution: they all survived and were released.<ref name="grundy" /> Despite this, controversy over smallpox inoculation intensified. However Caroline, Princess of Wales, was convinced of its value. The Princess's two daughters [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Amelia]] and [[Princess Caroline of Great Britain|Caroline]] were successfully inoculated in April 1722 by French-born surgeon [[Claudius Amyand (surgeon)|Claudius Amyand]].<ref name="Letters">Lady Mary Wortley Montagu: Selected Letters. Ed. Isobel Grundy. Penguin Books, 1997. Print.</ref> In response to the general fear of inoculation, Lady Mary, under a pseudonym, wrote and published an article describing and advocating in favour of inoculation in September 1722.<ref name="Letters" /> Later, other royal families soon followed Montagu's act. For instance, in 1768, Catherine the Great of Russia had herself and her son, the future Tsar Paul, inoculated. The Russians continued to refine the process.<ref name=":16" />

Nevertheless, inoculation was not always a safe process; inoculates developed a real case of smallpox and could infect others.<ref name=":16" /> The inoculation resulted in a "small number of deaths and complications, including serious infections."<ref name=":17">{{Cite book|last=Lindemann|first=Mary|title=Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0521732567|pages=77}}</ref> Subsequently, [[Edward Jenner]], who was 13 years old when Lady Mary died in 1762, developed the much safer technique of [[vaccination]] using [[cowpox]] instead of smallpox. Jenner's method involves "engrafting lymph taken from a pustulate of cowpox on the hand of a milkmaid into the arm of an inoculate."<ref name=":17" /> Jenner first tested his method on James Phipps, an eight-year-old boy, and when Phipps did not have any reaction after the procedure, Jenner claimed that his procedure "bestowed immunity against smallpox."<ref name=":17" /> Then, after spending the next few years experimenting his new procedure, he discovered that his hypothesis was correct.<ref name=":17" /> In 1919, while the world elite battled the newly elected people's government in Russia, mandatory vaccination was introduced here. The Russians largely eradicated smallpox by 1936. As vaccination gained acceptance, variolation gradually fell out of favour. In May 1958, during 11th World Health Assembly at WHO Headquarters in Geneva, Prof. V.M. Zhdanov, the Deputy Minister of Public Health of the Soviet Union, and a well-known virologist and epidemiologist, proposed a program for global smallpox
eradication and substantiated its feasibility. It would only be in 1967, that the World Health Organization embarked on a worldwide campaign to get rid of smallpox, and then, ten years later, smallpox was eradicated.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|last=Lindemann|first=Mary|title=Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0521732567|pages=71}}</ref> Overall, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's introduction of smallpox vaccination eventually led to the development of vaccines and later the eradication of smallpox.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

== Later years ==

[[File:18firth Pope.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Pope]] declared his love to Lady Mary, who responded with laughter.]]

After returning to England, Lady Mary took less interest in court compared to her earlier years. Instead, she was more focused on the upbringing of her children, reading, writing and editing her travel letters—which she then chose not to publish.<ref name="grundy" />

Before starting for the East, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had met [[Alexander Pope]], and during her Embassy travels with her husband, they wrote each other a series of letters. While Pope may have been fascinated by her wit and elegance, Lady Mary's replies to his letters reveal that she was not equally smitten.<ref name="grundy" /> Very few letters passed between them after Lady Mary's return to England, and various reasons have been suggested for the subsequent estrangement.<ref name="grundy" /> In 1728, Pope attacked Lady Mary in his ''[[The Dunciad|Dunciad]]'', which inaugurated a decade in which most of his publications made some sort of allegation against her.<ref name="grundy" />

Lady Mary went through a series of trials with her children. In 1726 and 1727, Lady Mary's son Edward ran away from [[Westminster School]] several times. He was then entrusted to a tutor with strict orders to keep him abroad. In later years, her son managed to return to England without permission and continued to have a strained relationship with both his parents.<ref name="grundy" /> In the summer of 1736, Lady Mary's daughter fell in love with John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, but he had little fortune; Lady Mary warned her daughter about the disadvantages of living in poverty.<ref name=":20">{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=155}}</ref>In August 1736, Lady Mary's daughter married [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]], despite her parents' disapproval of the match.<ref name="Letters" /> Later, Lady Mary wrote to Lord Gower, 1st Earl Gower, about her daughter's disobedience.<ref name=":20" /> In response, Lord Gower tried to console Lady Mary: "I hope by her future conducts she will atone for her past, and that choice will prove more happy than you and Mr. Wortley expect."<ref name=":20" />In the same year, Mary met and fell in love with Count [[Francesco Algarotti]], who competed with an equally smitten John Hervey for her affections.<ref>Rictor Norton, "John, Lord Hervey: The Third Sex", The Great Queers of History. 8 August 2009.

Lady Mary wrote many letters to Francesco Algarotti in English and in French after his departure from England in September 1736.<ref name="Letters" /> In July 1739, Lady Mary departed England without her husband ostensibly for health reasons, possibly from a disfiguring skin disease, and declared her intentions to winter in the south of France; after she left England, she and her husband never met again.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paston|first=George|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu And Her Times|publisher=G.

When she reached Augsburg on 1 October, she wrote to Sir James and Lady Francis Steuart that "she hoped to meet them in Holland."<ref name=":21" /> She recorded her perils and fatigues to Sir James in a letter: "I am dragging my ragged remnant of life to England.

Although Lady Mary Wortley Montagu is now best known for her ''Embassy Letters'', she wrote poetry and essays as well.<ref>Backscheider, Paula R., and Catherine E. Ingrassia, eds. British Women Poets of the Long Eighteenth Century. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009. 880. Print.</ref> A number of Lady Mary's poems and essays were printed in her lifetime, either without or with her permission, in newspapers, in miscellanies, and independently.<ref name="grundy" />

Mary Astell convinced Montagu to publish her letters, which later became known as ''Embassy Letters''.<ref name=":24">{{Cite book|last=O' Quinn|first=Daniel|title=Engaging the Ottoman Empire: Vexed Medications, 1690–1815|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2019|isbn=978-1333260675|pages=167}}</ref> Montagu did not intend to publish her poetry, but it did circulate widely, in manuscript, among members of her own social circle.<ref>Bowles, Emliy.

"Constantinople," written January 1718, is a beautiful poem in heroic couplets describing Britain and Turkey through human history, and representing the states of mind "of knaves, coxcombs, the mob, and party zealous—all characteristic of the London of her time".<ref>Backscheider, Paula R., and Catherine E.

In 1737 and 1738, Lady Mary published anonymously a political periodical called the ''Nonsense of Common-Sense'', supporting the [[Robert Walpole]] government. The title was a reference to a journal of the liberal opposition entitled ''Common Sense''. She wrote six Town Eclogues and other poems.<ref name="Letters" /> She wrote notable letters describing her travels through Europe and the Ottoman Empire; these appeared after her death in three volumes. Lady Mary corresponded with Anne Wortley and wrote courtship letters to her future husband Edward Wortley Montagu, as well as love letters to Francesco Algarotti. She corresponded with notable writers, intellectuals and aristocrats of her day. She wrote gossip letters and letters berating the vagaries of fashionable people to her sister, Lady Mar, the daughter of the Whig Duke of Kingston.  They met when the Wortleys visited Paris, France on 29 September 1718.<ref name=":25">{{Cite book|last=Paston|first=George|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu And Her Times|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|year=1907|isbn=978-1333260675|pages=280}}</ref> During her visit, Montagu observed the beauties and behaviors of Parisian women. She wrote "their hair cut short and curled round their faces, loaded with powder that makes it look like white wool!"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paston|first=George|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu And Her Times|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|year=1907|isbn=978-1333260675|pages=281}}</ref> In one of their correspondences, Lady Mary informed her sister of the ‘surprising death’ of her father. Furthermore, they exchanged intellectual letters with Montagu's only daughter, Lady Bute. Lady Mary and Lady Mar discontinued their correspondence in 1727.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paston|first=George|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu And Her Times|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|year=1907|isbn=978-1333260675|pages=355}}</ref> During the twentieth century Lady Mary's letters were edited separately from her essays, poems and plays.<ref name="Letters" /> Although not published during her lifetime, her letters from Turkey were clearly intended for print.  She revised them extensively and gave a transcript to the Reverend Benjamin Sowden, a British clergyman, in Rotterdam in 1761. Sowden also lent the book to two English travelers, including Thomas Becket.<ref name=":26" /> Furthermore, during that night, the travelers made copies of her letters.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=288}}</ref> After the travelers returned the book, Sowden handed the book to Lord Bute, the husband of Lady Mary's only daughter, in exchange for two hundred pounds.<ref name=":26" /> In 1763 in London, the year after Montagu's death, Becket and De Hondt published this error-laden version manuscript in three volumes, entitled ''Letters of the Right Honourable Lady My W—y M----e: Written, during her Travels in Europe, Asia and Africa, to Persons of Distinction, Men of Letters, &c. in different Parts of Europe; Which contain, Among other curious Relations, Accounts of the Policy and Manners of the Turks'', commonly referred to as the ''Embassy Letters'' or ''Turkish Embassy Letters'' because it was "composed during and after Montagu’s journey through Europe to Constantinople in the company of her husband''."''<ref name="grundy" /><ref name=":18" /><ref name=":26" /> The first edition of the book sold out; in fact, the ''Critical Review'' newspaper editor, [[Tobias Smollett]], wrote that the letters were "never equaled by any letter-writer of any sex, age or nation" and Voltaire also had high praise of these letters.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Halsband|first=Robert|title=The Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1956|isbn=978-0198115489|pages=289}}</ref> Four years later in 1767, editor John Cleland added five spurious letters, along with previous printed essays and verses, to the previous edition of the book.<ref name=":27">{{Cite book|last=O’ Quinn|first=Daniel|title=Engaging the Ottoman Empire: Vexed Medications, 1690–1815|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2019|isbn=978-1333260675|pages=169}}</ref>

Despite the immediate success following the publication of ''Turkish Embassy Letters'', Lady Bute was furious and worried about how an unauthorized publication would impact the family's reputation.<ref name=":28">{{Cite book|last=Paston|first=George|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu And Her Times|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|year=1907|isbn=978-1333260675|pages=534}}</ref> One of the manuscript volumes that others found was Lady Mary's famous diary, and Lady Bute did not have any knowledge of this existence until a few days before her mother's death.<ref name=":28" /> After she received these volumes, Lady Bute "kept it always under lock and key, and though she often looked over it herself, and read passages aloud to her daughters and friends, excepting the first five or six copy-books, which at a late period, she permitted Lady Louisa Stuart to peruse alone, upon condition that nothing should be transcribed."<ref name=":28" /> Lady Louisa Stuart, the youngest of Lady Bute's daughters, was scolded for reading books and wanting to be like her grandmother.<ref name=":25" /> Later, Lady Louisa followed her grandmother's footsteps and became a writer.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paston|first=George|title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu And Her Times|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|year=1907|isbn=978-1333260675|pages=536}}</ref> Then when Lady Bute felt that the end of her life was near, in 1794, she burnt the diary that her mother kept since her marriage.<ref name=":28" /> She chose to burn the diary because Lady Bute always spoke to her mother with great respect, and she feared the possibility of a scandal.<ref name=":28" />

According to O'Quinn, although ''The Turkish Embassy Letters'' has been considered one of the best literary works published in the eighteenth century, the work has not been as appreciated as those published by her male peers, such as Alexander Pope and Horace Walpole.<ref name=":18" /> She was the "target of vicious attacks"<ref name=":18" /> from printing presses and male peers. Although she describes her travels through Europe to the Ottoman Empire in ''The Turkish Embassy Letters'' to her correspondents, very few of the letters survived, and the letters in the book may not be accurate transcriptions of the actual correspondence.<ref name=":24" /> According to Daniel O'Quinn, the book was not a culmination of facts but of opinions, and there must be some filtering during the editing processes.<ref name=":24" /> Furthermore, to avoid public censure, Montagu used pseudonyms, such as "a Turkey merchant" and "Lady President, in her publications.<ref>{{Cite book|last=O’Quinn|first=Daniel|title=Engaging the Ottoman Empire: Vexed Medications, 1690–1815|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2019|isbn=978-1333260675|pages=167-168}}</ref> Lastly, Montagu’s ''The Turkish Embassy Letters'' was published posthumously-Walpole affirmed that it was Montagu’s deathbed wish to get the letters published.<ref name=":27" />

An important early letter was published, probably without Montagu's consent, titled "The Genuine Copy of a Letter Written From Constantinople by an English Lady" in 1719.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Montagu |first=Mary Wortley |title=The Genuine Copy of a Letter Written From Constantinople by an English Lady, Who Was Lately in Turkey, and Who Is No Less Distinguish'd by Her Wit Than By Her Quality; to a Venetian Nobleman, One of the Prime Virtuosi of the Age, Translated from the French Original, Which is Likewise Added |publisher=J.

In relation to these practices, she wrote, "I cannot fancy there is anything new in letting you know that priests can lie, and the mob believe all over the world."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Montagu, Mary Wortley |title=The Turkish embassy letters |date=2013 |publisher=Broadview Press |editor=Heffernan, Teresa |editor2=O'Quinn, Daniel |isbn=9781554810420 |location=Peterborough, Ont. |pages=83 |oclc=820133066}}</ref>

Montagu's Turkish letters were to prove an inspiration to later generations of European women travellers and writers. In particular, Montagu staked a claim to the authority of women's writing, due to their ability to access private homes and [[Women only space|female-only spaces]] where men were not permitted. The title of her published letters is "Sources that Have Been Inaccessible to Other Travellers." The letters themselves frequently draw attention to the fact that they present a different, and Montagu asserts more accurate description than that provided by previous (male) travellers: "You will perhaps be surpriz'd at an Account so different from what you have been entertained with by the common Voyage-writers who are very fond of speaking of what they don't know."<ref name="Letters" /> In general, Montagu dismisses the quality of European travel literature of the 18th century as nothing more than "trite observations…superficial…[of] boys [who] only remember where they met with the best wine or the prettiest women." Montagu writes about the "warmth and civility"<ref>{{Cite book|last=O'Loughlin|first=Katrina|title=Women, Writing, and Travel in the Eighteenth Century|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2018|isbn=978-1107088528|pages=2018}}</ref> of Ottoman women. She describes the ''hammam'', a Turkish bath, "as a space of urbane homosociality, free of cruel satire and disdain."<ref>{{Cite book|last=O'Loughlin|first=Katrina|title=Women, Writing, and Travel in the Eighteenth Century|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2018|isbn=978-1107088528|pages=53}}</ref> She mentions that "''hammam'' are remarkable for their undisguised admiration of the women's beauty and demeanor,"<ref>{{Cite book|last=O'Loughlin|first=Katrina|title=Women, Writing, and Travel in the Eighteenth Century|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2018|isbn=978-1107088528|pages=36}}</ref> which creates a space for female authority. Montagu provides an intimate description of the women's bathhouse in [[Sofia]], in which she derides male descriptions of the bathhouse as a site for unnatural sexual practices, instead insisting that it was "the Women's coffee house, where all the news of the Town is told, Scandal invented, etc."<ref name="Letters" /> Montagu's reference to "women's coffee house" represents the political and social freedom that women had access to in the Ottoman Empire during the 18th century.<ref name=":29">{{Cite book|last=O'Loughlin|first=Katrina|title=Women, Writing, and Travel in the Eighteenth Century|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2018|isbn=978-1107088528|pages=55}}</ref> Even though Montagu refused to undress for the bath at first, the girls managed to persuade her and "open my shirt, and show them my stays, which satisfied them very well.<ref name=":19" /> In one letter to her sister Lady Mar, she wrote, "nothing will surprise you more than the sight of my person, as I am now in my Turkish habit."<ref name=":29" /> However, Montagu's detailed descriptions of nude Oriental beauties provided inspiration for male artists such as [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], who depicted the explicitly erotic content that Montagu had criticized.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

During Montagu's time in the Ottoman Empire, she saw and wrote extensively concerning the practise of [[slavery]] along with the treatment of slaves by the Turks. Montagu wrote many letters with approving descriptions of the various slaves that she saw in the elite circles of Istanbul, including [[eunuch]]s and large collections of serving and dancing girls dressed in expensive outfits.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Beach |first=Adam |date=2006 |title=Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Slavery in the Ottoman (and the British) Empire |journal=Philological Quarterly |volume=85 |pages=293–314 |via=EBSCO Academic Search Premier}}</ref> In one of her letters written back home, famously from the interior of a bath house, she dismisses the idea that slaves of the Ottoman elite should be figures to be pitied.  In response to her visit to the slave market in [[Istanbul]], she wrote "you will imagine me half a Turk when I don't speak of it with the same horror other Christians have done before me, but I cannot forbear applauding the humanity of the Turks to those creatures. They are never ill-used, and their slavery is in my opinion no worse than servitude all over the world."<ref name=":26">{{Cite book |last=Montagu, Mary Wortley  |title=The Turkish embassy letters |date=2013 |publisher=Broadview Press |editor=Heffernan, Teresa |editor2=O'Quinn, Daniel |isbn=9781554810420 |location=Peterborough, Ont. |pages=169 |oclc=820133066}}</ref> She did not write about [[Atlantic slave trade|African slavery in the Western world]], but the [[Jonathan Richardson the Younger]] portrait that depicts Montagu accompanied by a young black slave boy in a golden collar who holds an umbrella shows that she was intimately familiar with and participated in the tradition in which European [[aristocracy]] owned young black servants and used them as part of their social equipage.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tobin, Beth Fowkes. |title=Picturing imperial power : colonial subjects in eighteenth-century British painting |date=1999 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822323052 |location=Durham, N.C. |oclc=39654797}}</ref>

Montagu's Turkish letters were frequently cited by Western female travellers, more than a century after her journey. Such writers cited Montagu's assertion that women travellers could gain an intimate view of Turkish life that was not available to their male counterparts. However, they also added corrections or elaborations to her observations.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

In 1739, a book was printed by an unknown author under the pseudonym "Sophia, a person of quality", titled ''Woman not Inferior to Man''. This book is often attributed to Lady Mary.<ref>South American Independence: Gender, Politics, Text. Eds. Catherine Davies, Claire Brewster, and Hilary Owen. Liverpool University Press, 2006. 29.Print.</ref>

Her ''Letters and Works'' were published in 1837. Montagu's octogenarian granddaughter [[Lady Louisa Stuart]] contributed to this, anonymously, an introductory essay called ''Biographical Anecdotes of Lady M. W. Montagu'', from which it was clear that Stuart was troubled by her grandmother's focus on sexual intrigues and did not see Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's ''Account of the Court of George I at his Accession'' as history. However, Montagu's historical observations, both in the "Anecdotes" and the ''Turkish Embassy Letters'', prove quite accurate when put in context.<ref>Looser, Devoney.
