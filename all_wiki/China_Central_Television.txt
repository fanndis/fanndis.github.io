'''China Central Television''' ('''CCTV''') is a [[China|Chinese]] [[State media|state-controlled broadcaster]]. CCTV has a network of 50 channels broadcasting different programmes and is accessible to more than one billion viewers in six different languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/sports/olympics/22cctv.html|title=Olympics Are Ratings Bonanza for Chinese TV|date=22 August 2008|work=The New York Times|access-date=1 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152257/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/sports/olympics/22cctv.html|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Most of its programmes are a mixture of news, documentary, social education, comedy, entertainment, and drama, the majority of which consists of Chinese soap operas and entertainment,<ref name=brady08 /> however factual reporting about topics which are sensitive to the CCP is distorted and often used as a weapon against the CCP's perceived enemies.<ref name="Freedom House" />

CCTV was established on 1 May 1958 to be a state-owned news and public opinion steering agency, acting as a mouthpiece of the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. CCTV has a variety of functions, such as news communication, social education, culture, and entertainment information services. As a state television station it is responsible to both the [[Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party]] and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].<ref name="Zhu2010">{{cite book|author=Ying Zhu|title=Two Billion Eyes: The Story of China Central Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qkgFB0J8YxwC|date=4 May 2010|publisher=New Press|isbn=978-1-59558-802-9|author-link=Ying Zhu|access-date=8 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224063320/https://books.google.com/books?id=qkgFB0J8YxwC|archive-date=24 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It is the central player in the [[Propaganda in China|Chinese government's propaganda network]].<ref name="Freedom House">{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Sarah|date=September 25, 2019|title=China Central Television: A Long-standing Weapon in Beijing's Arsenal of Repression|url=https://freedomhouse.org/article/china-central-television-long-standing-weapon-beijings-arsenal-repression|accessdate=15 November 2020|publisher=[[Freedom House]]}}</ref>

==History==
In 1954, [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]] [[Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party|chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] put forward that China should establish its own TV station. On February 5, 1955, the central broadcasting bureau reported to the State Council and proposed the program of establishing a medium-sized television station, later on premier [[Zhou Enlai]] included in China's first [[Five-year plans of China|five-year plan]] the planned introduction of television broadcasts. In December 1957, the central broadcasting bureau sent [[Luo Donghe]] and [[Meng Qiyu]] to the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[German Democratic Republic]] for the inspection of [[Television in the Soviet Union|their TV stations]], then the duo returned to Beijing to prepare for the establishment of the promised TV station.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

At 19:00 on 1 May 1958; Beijing Television (the predecessor of China Central Television) began its test transmissions, and for the first time, [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s own TV signals were broadcast in Beijing. On the screens of the few dozen television receivers in Beijing that night, a picture of the headquarters building with the words "Beijing TV station" written on it appeared. On September 2 of that year, BTV broadcast officially for the first time. Later the number of official TV programs increased from twice a week to four times a week (on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

From 1 January 1960; BTV changed the fixed program schedule and started to broadcast eight times a week and added one program on Sunday morning. BTV also set up a dozen fixed TV shows in order to cater to the vast audiences, the shows include news columns and entertainment shows. The media function of TV had extended further. In May of the same year, the construction of the "new building" in the courtyard of the headquarters was completed. Due to increasing demands, it soon launched its second channel in 1963 and third channel in 1969, followed by the first simultaneous satellite broadcasts nationwide in 1972.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Starting from 1 May 1973, Beijing Television began broadcasting experimentally in color on its second channel every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday using the [[PAL|PAL-D]] system, and fully converted to color broadcasting by 1977. On January 1, 1978; its flagship news broadcasts were officially launched. On May 1 of the same year, with the approval of the CPC Central Committee, BTV, which celebrated its 20th anniversary was officially renamed CCTV (China Central Television, [[:zh:中国中央电视台|中央电视台]]) and a new logomark debuted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cctv.com/english/20030805/101215.shtml|title=CCTV-English Channel|accessdate=1 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161209014836/http://www.cctv.com/english/20030805/101215.shtml|archive-date=9 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1979, the iconic butterfly logo made its debut, which would be used as the corporate identity of the CCTV network for the next two decades.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Until the late 1970s, CCTV held only evening broadcasts, usually closing down at midnight. During the summer and winter academic vacations, it occasionally transmitted daytime programming for students, while special daytime programs were aired during national holidays. In 1980 CCTV experimented with news relays from local and central television studios via [[microwave]].<ref>Miller, T. (2003). ''Television: Critical Concepts in Media and Cultural Studies''. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-25502-8}}.</ref> By 1985, CCTV had already become a leading television network in China. In 1987 CCTV's popularity soared due to the adaptation and presentation of ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber (1987 TV series)|Dream of the Red Chamber]]''. The 36-episode TV series—the first Chinese television drama to enter the global market—<ref name=kops>Kops, M. & Ollig, S. ''Internationalization of the Chinese TV Sector.''

In the same year, CCTV exported 10,216 programmes to 77 foreign television stations.<ref name=kops/>

Initially, the [[Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party]] issued directive [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|censorship]] of programs. During reform in the 1990s, the Party adopted new standards for CCTV, "affordability" and "acceptability", loosening the previous government control.<ref>Kops & Ollig, pp. 34.</ref> Affordability refers to purchasing ability of programs, while acceptability requires that a program has acceptable content, preventing the broadcast of material that contains inappropriate content or expresses views against the Chinese Communist Party.<ref>Kops & Ollig, pp. 35.</ref>

On 2 September 2008, the new [[CCTV Headquarters]] was opened on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of CCTV.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In July 2009 CCTV expanded its coverage and target audience by launching CCTV-العربية, its international channel in [[Arabic language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knowckers.org/2009/08/strategie-de-puissance-et-dinfluence-le-pragmatisme-chinois/|title=Stratégie de puissance et d'influence: le pragmatisme chinois : Knowckers|accessdate=1 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913221626/http://www.knowckers.org/2009/08/strategie-de-puissance-et-dinfluence-le-pragmatisme-chinois/|archive-date=13 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 17 June 2013, CCTV announced that most of the broadcast facilities for the CCTV network have been relocated to the current headquarters building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tv.cctv.com/live/|title=CCTV|date=January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119102823/http://tv.cctv.com/live/|archive-date=19 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 31 December 2016, China Central Television's foreign language services were spun off into [[China Global Television Network|China Global Television Network (CGTN)]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In March 2018, as the nation began marking the 60th year of television, CCTV ownership changed hands to a new state holding group, the [[China Media Group]], as the television arm of the newly launched multimedia broadcasting conglomerate operated by both the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

==Organization==
China Central Television, as a component of the CMG, falls under the supervision of the [[National Radio and Television Administration]] which is in turn subordinate to the State Council of the People's Republic of China. A Vice [[Political minister|Minister]] of the state council serves as chairman of CCTV. The organisation has relationships with regional television stations run by local governments, which must reserve up to two channels for the national broadcaster.<ref name=ad>[http://www.adweek.com/aw/google/article_brief/1003541507 CCTV: One Network, 1.2&nbsp;Billion Viewers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126204339/http://www.adweek.com/aw/google/article_brief/1003541507 |date=26 January 2018 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126204339/http://www.adweek.com/aw/google/article_brief/1003541507 |date=26 January 2018 }}, ''Adweek'', 5 February 2007.</ref>

Although news reform has been a prominent feature of CCTV networks, the Evening News has remained relatively the same since its first appearance in the early 1980s. Many important political news stories are broadcast through the program.

''Focus'', first introduced in 1994, is a popular programme on CCTV. This discussion programme regularly exposes the wrongdoings of local officials, which attracts serious attention from higher levels of government. The programme also exposes the Chinese Government's response to the charges of corruption.<ref name=shirk>Shirk, S. L. (2007). ''China: Fragile Superpower.''

==Reception==
The network's principal directors and other officers are appointed by the State, and so are the top officials at local conventional television stations in mainland China; nearly all of them are restricted to broadcasting within their own province or municipality. [[Editorial independence]] is subject to government policy considerations, and as a result, it has been charged with being "[[propaganda]] aimed at brainwashing the audience" in its history and news programmes in a letter written by a number of Chinese intellectuals who also called for a boycott of state media was posted on a US-based website and has circulated through Chinese websites.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7824255.stm China TV faces propaganda charge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819222440/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7824255.stm |date=19 August 2020 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819222440/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7824255.stm |date=19 August 2020 }}, ''BBC News'', 12 January 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_325896.html  'Boycott state media' call] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205203549/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_325896.html |date=5 February 2010 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205203549/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_325896.html |date=5 February 2010 }}, ''The Straits Times'', 14 January 2009.</ref> The network often publishes misleading and false information, particularly as it pertains to issues considered sensitive by the Chinese government.

Journalists working for the network's English-language international channel, CGTN, as well as of the other non-Chinese language TV channels under the CGTN banner, are under constant pressure to present a positive account of China, according to [[Anne-Marie Brady|Anne-Marie Brady's]] study published in 2008. "In August 2005, a series of items reported factually on the [[2005 Sunjiawan mine disaster|coal mining disaster]] in China; soon after the channel's leaders received a warning from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that its reports were harming China's international image. Following this incident, senior editorial staff and journalists were all forced to write self-criticisms."<ref name=brady08>[[Anne-Marie Brady]], ''Marketing Dictatorship: Propaganda and Thought Work in Contemporary China'', Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.</ref>

Brady says that while the channel's equipment is state-of-the-art, the employees are not well trained in how to use it, so there are frequent errors during a broadcast. "The political controls on the station contribute to a generally low level of morale and initiative among station staff," she writes.<ref name=brady08 />

A study done by the observer of Chinese film and television, Ying Zhu, suggests that "CCTV is full of serious-minded creators who regularly experience bouts of self-doubt, philosophical ambivalence, and in some cases, [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]]." During her extensive interviews with key CCTV players, Zhu notes that "Certain common themes, about ideals, distorted or altogether thwarted by commercial and political pressure, emerged."<ref>[[Ying Zhu]], "The Inside Story of When China's State-Run TV Criticized the Party", the Atlantic web site, https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/the-inside-story-of-when-chinas-state-run-tv-criticized-the-party/258102 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015901/https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/the-inside-story-of-when-chinas-state-run-tv-criticized-the-party/258102/ |date=18 October 2017 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015901/https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/the-inside-story-of-when-chinas-state-run-tv-criticized-the-party/258102/ |date=18 October 2017 }}, accessed June 2012</ref><ref name=NewPressTwoBillionEyes>[[Ying Zhu]], {{cite book|title=Two Billion Eyes|year=2012|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|url=http://thenewpress.com/index.php?option=com_catalog&task=author&author_id=P39602|access-date=4 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415182252/http://thenewpress.com/index.php?option=com_catalog&task=author&author_id=P39602|archive-date=15 April 2012|url-status=live}}, forthcoming October 2012</ref>

According to [[Freedom House]] CCTV "has a consistent record of blatantly and egregiously violating journalistic standards and encouraging or justifying hatred and violence against innocent people. CCTV is an essential component of the CCP's brutal authoritarian regime and should be treated as such."<ref name="Freedom House" />

In 2020, the [[United States Department of State]] designated CCTV as a "foreign mission," which requires it to disclose more about its operations in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wong|first=Edward|date=2020-06-22|title=U.S. Designates Four More Chinese News Organizations as Foreign Missions|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/politics/us-china-news-organizations.html|access-date=2020-06-23|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200622221012/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/politics/us-china-news-organizations.html|archive-date=22 June 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last1=Ruwitch|first1=John|last2=Kelemen|first2=Michele|date=June 22, 2020|title=Trump Administration Labels 4 More Chinese News Outlets 'Foreign Missions'|work=[[NPR]]|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/06/22/881755421/trump-administration-labels-4-more-chinese-news-outlets-foreign-missions|url-status=live|access-date=June 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200622211319/https://www.npr.org/2020/06/22/881755421/trump-administration-labels-4-more-chinese-news-outlets-foreign-missions|archive-date=22 June 2020}}</ref>

==Controversies==
Since its inception CCTV has served as a tool of state power and as such has been complicit in human rights abuses. They have a history of demonizing and inciting hatred against those perceived as foes by the CCP, in this way they can be used to mobilize against threats as diverse as Falun Gong and international Human Rights Groups.<ref name="Freedom House" />

===1990s Falun Gong crackdown===
One of the earliest recorded uses of the Network for both domestic and international propaganda purposes occurred in 1999 during the first crackdown on the [[Falun Gong]] meditation and spiritual movement. During one 32 day period in 1999 ''Focus Talk'' ran 28 episodes which defamed practitioners and incited hatred against them.<ref name="Diplomat 2019" /> In 2001 they deceptively claimed that a group of people who had set themselves on fire in Tiananmen Square were Falun Gong adherents, a claim which was characterized as "clearly abusive" by the Canadian regulatory commission.<ref name="Freedom House" />

===Xinwen Lianbo and internet purity===
On 27 December 2007, [[Xinwen Lianbo]] aired a report about the wide and easy availability of explicit content on the internet. The report appealed to juristic institutions and government to hurry to make relevant legislation in order to purify the internet environment. In the report, a young student described a [[pop-up advertisement]] she saw as being "[[very erotic very violent]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ce.cn/cysc/tech/07hlw/guonei/200801/07/t20080107_14132430.shtml |title=Officers of State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television |access-date=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219185201/http://www.ce.cn/cysc/tech/07hlw/guonei/200801/07/t20080107_14132430.shtml |archive-date=19 February 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> After the airing of the report, many [[Kuso|parodies]] were posted by internet users ridiculing the comment and CCTV's credibility in part.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edu.people.com.cn/GB/6740971.html |script-title=zh:女生上"新闻联播"称网页很黄很暴力遭恶搞 |language=zh |website=[[People's Daily Online]] |accessdate=8 January 2008 |title=Archived copy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218181415/http://edu.people.com.cn/GB/6740971.html |archive-date=18 February 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> The incident also questioned the reliability of ''Xinwen Lianbo'', noting the unlikelihood of a web page being both violent and erotic at the same time (even though such pages do exist), and the age of the student interviewed.

===Libyan Civil War===
During the U.S.-led coalition's military intervention in Libya in 2011, reports from CCTV tended to support Gaddafi's arguments, claiming that the coalition forces attacked Libya civilians and the military intervention was no different from an invasion. In some of the news reports, CCTV used pictures of protesters demonstration and said that these people were against the coalition's military intervention. CCTV also mislabeled a person holding a banner which said "Vive la France" ("long live France" in French) and claimed that he was a supporter of Gaddafi. Later on 27 March, a Chinese banner that said "Muammar Gaddafi is a lier. {{sic}}" was shown up in some Libyan demonstration videos from Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://v.ifeng.com/news/world/201103/a504ae85-65ce-423f-84c9-20c18b499694.shtml|title=利比亚反对派举中文标语"卡扎菲是说谎者"|accessdate=1 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422214347/http://v.ifeng.com/news/world/201103/a504ae85-65ce-423f-84c9-20c18b499694.shtml|archive-date=22 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
