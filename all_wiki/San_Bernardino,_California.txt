The city of San Bernardino, California, occupies much of the [[San Bernardino Valley]], which indigenous tribespeople originally referred to as "The Valley of the Cupped Hand of God". The [[Tongva people|Tongva Indians]] also called the San Bernardino area '''Wa'aach''' in their language.<ref>[[Pamela Munro|Munro, Pamela]], et al., ''Yaara' Shiraaw'ax 'Eyooshiraaw'a.

===19th century===
[[File:SanBernardino-1852.jpg|thumb|left|San Bernardino, 1852]]
[[Politana, California|Politana]] was the first Spanish settlement in the San Bernardino Valley, named for [[Bernardino of Siena]].  Politana was established May 20, 1810, as a mission chapel and supply station by the [[Mission San Gabriel]] in the [[ranchería]] of the Guachama Indians that lived on the bluff that is now known as [[Bunker Hill (San Bernardino, California)|Bunker Hill]], near [[Lytle Creek (California)|Lytle Creek]].  Two years later the settlement was destroyed by local tribesmen, following powerful earthquakes that shook the region. Several years later, the [[Serrano people|Serrano]] and [[Cahuilla|Mountain Cahuilla]] rebuilt the Politana rancheria, and in 1819 invited the missionaries to return to the valley. They did and established the [[San Bernardino de Sena Estancia]].  Serrano and Cahuilla people inhabited Politana until long after the 1830s decree of secularization and the 1842 inclusion into the [[Rancho San Bernardino]] land grant of the [[José del Carmen Lugo]] family.<ref name=History>[https://archive.org/details/historyofsanbern00caba Caballeria y Collell, Juan, HISTORY OF SAN BERNARDINO VALLEY, from the padres to the pioneers, 1810-1851, Times-Index Press, San Bernardino, Cal., 1902.]</ref>{{rp|37–41}}

The city of San Bernardino is one of the oldest communities in the state of California, and in its present-day location, was not largely settled until 1851, after California became a state. The first [[English-American|Anglo-American]] colony was established by pioneers associated with [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] or Mormons.  Following the Mormon colonists' purchase of Rancho San Bernardino, and the establishment of the town of San Bernardino in 1851, San Bernardino County was formed in 1853 from parts of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. Mormons laid out the town based on the "City of Zion" plan which was typical of Mormon urban planning. Cities are typically laid out with North-South, East-West streets in predetermined city block sizes with wide streets. Often cities are laid out with an alphabetical and numerical system typical for Mormon towns, with streets running alphabet letters for North-South streets and numbers for East-West streets.<ref>https://eom.byu.edu/index.php/City_Planning</ref> Mormon colonists developed irrigated, commercial farming and lumbering, supplying agricultural produce and lumber throughout Southern California. The city was officially incorporated in 1857. Later that year, most of the colonists were recalled by [[Brigham Young]] in 1857 due to the [[Utah War]].  Once highly regarded in early California, news of the [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]] poisoned attitudes toward the Mormons. Some Mormons would stay in San Bernardino and some later returned from [[Utah]], but a real estate consortium from [[El Monte, California|El Monte]] and [[Los Angeles]] bought most of the lands of the old rancho and of the departing colonists. They sold these lands to new settlers who came to dominate the culture and politics in the county and San Bernardino became a typical American frontier town. Many of the new land owners disliked the sober Mormons, indulging in drinking at saloons now allowed in the town. Disorder, fighting and violence in the vicinity became common, reaching a climax in the 1859 [[Ainsworth - Gentry Affair]].

In 1860 a gold rush began in the mountains nearby with the discovery of [[gold]] by [[William F. Holcomb]] in [[Holcomb Valley]] early 1860.  Another strike followed in the upper reach of Lytle Creek. By the 1860s, San Bernardino had also become an important trading hub in [[Southern California]]. The city already on the [[Mormon Road#Los Angeles .E2.80.93 Salt Lake Road 1855.E2.80.931905|Los Angeles – Salt Lake Road]], became the starting point for the [[Mojave Road]] from 1858 and [[Bradshaw Trail]] from 1862 to the mines along the [[Colorado River]] and within the [[Arizona Territory]] in the [[Steamboats of the Colorado River#Colorado River Gold Rush|gold rush of 1862-1864]].

<!--The following should be combined somehow with the paragraph before last-->
Near San Bernardino is a naturally formed arrowhead-shaped rock formation on the side of a mountain. It measures 1375 feet by 449 feet. According to the Native American legend regarding the landmark arrowhead, an arrow from Heaven burned the formation onto the mountainside in order to show tribes where they could be healed. During the mid-19th century, "Dr." David Noble Smith claimed that a saint-like being appeared before him and told of a far-off land with exceptional climate and curative waters, marked by a gigantic arrowhead. Smith's search for that unique arrowhead formation began in Texas, and eventually ended at Arrowhead Springs in California in 1857. By 1889, word of the springs, along with the hotel on the site (and a belief in the effect on general health of the water from the springs) had grown considerably. Hotel guests often raved about the crystal-clear water from the cold springs, which prompted Seth Marshall to set up a bottling operation in the hotel's basement. By 1905, water from the cold springs was being shipped to Los Angeles under the newly created [[Arrowhead Water|"Arrowhead" trademark]].

Indigenous people of the San Bernardino Valley and Mountains were collectively identified by Spanish explorers in the 19th century as [[Serrano (people)|Serrano]], a term meaning highlander. Serrano living near what is now Big Bear Lake were called Yuhaviatam, or "People of the Pines". In 1866, to clear the way for settlers and gold miners, state militia conducted a 32-day campaign slaughtering men, women, and children.<ref>{{Cite web

In 1867, the first Chinese immigrants arrived in San Bernardino.

In 1883, [[California Southern Railroad]] established a rail link through San Bernardino between Los Angeles and the rest of the country.

In 1905, the city of San Bernardino passed its first charter.

[[Norton Air Force Base]] was established during World War II.

In 1940, [[Richard and Maurice McDonald]] founded [[McDonald's]], along with its innovative restaurant concept, in the city.<ref>''[[Modern Marvels]]'' "Fast Food Tech"; [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]; Viewed December 3, 2009</ref>

Inspired by the success of McDonald's, Neal T. Baker founded his first restaurant in 1952, calling it [[Baker's Drive-Thru|Baker's Burgers]]. Three years later, Baker added Mexican food to the menu. Burgers were sold at one window and Mexican food at another; he called this the "Twin Kitchen" concept.

In 1980, the Panorama Fire destroyed 284 homes.

San Bernardino won the [[All-America City]] award in 1977,<ref>{{cite web|title=Past Winners|url=https://www.nationalcivicleague.org/america-city-award/past-winners/?string=san+bernadino|website=National Civic League|access-date=16 March 2018}}</ref> but the city subsequently went into a long decline and has only recently begun to recover from the three recessions of the late 20th/early 21st centuries.

In 1994, Norton Air Force Base closed to become [[San Bernardino International Airport]].

In October 2003, another wildfire, the Old Fire, destroyed over 1,000 homes.

In August 2012, San Bernardino filed for [[Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code|Chapter 9 bankruptcy]], with more than $1 billion in debt.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bankrupty-san-bernardino-idUSBRE87105220120802|title=San Bernardino, California, files for bankruptcy with over $1 billion in debts|date=August 2, 2012|work=Reuters|access-date=June 12, 2017}}</ref> The move froze the city's payments to creditors, including its pension payments to the California Public Employees Retirement System for nearly a year. Key changes the city made during the bankruptcy process included: outsourcing its fire department to the county and re-writing the city's charter to provide a more clear chain of command. San Bernardino became the largest city at the time to file for a Chapter 9 bankruptcy,<ref name="CBS20120711" /><ref name="BW20120817" /> superseded by [[Detroit]]'s filing in July 2013. Following a judge's approval, the city emerged from bankruptcy in February 2017, making it one of the longest municipal bankruptcies in the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

On December 2, 2015, [[2015 San Bernardino attack|a terrorist attack]] left 14 people dead and 22 seriously injured.

==Geography==
[[File:San Bernardino by Sentinel-2, 2019-03-30.jpg|thumb|Satellite photo of San Bernardino]]
[[File:Sb 2004 dt skyline 006a.jpg|thumb|right|San Bernardino with downtown in the background and the I-215 freeway in the foreground.]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|59.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|59.2|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2}}, or 0.74%, is water.

The city lies in the San Bernardino foothills and the eastern portion of the [[San Bernardino Valley]], roughly {{convert|60|mi|km}} east of Los Angeles. Some major geographical features of the city include the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] and the [[San Bernardino National Forest]], in which the city's northernmost neighborhood, Arrowhead Springs, is located; the [[Cajon Pass]] adjacent to the northwest border; City Creek, [[Lytle Creek (California)|Lytle Creek]], [[San Timoteo Creek]], Twin Creek, Warm Creek (as modified through flood control channels) feed the [[Santa Ana River]], which forms part of the city's southern border south of [[San Bernardino International Airport]].

San Bernardino is unique among Southern Californian cities because of its wealth of water, which is mostly contained in underground aquifers. A large part of the city is over the Bunker Hill Groundwater Basin, including [[downtown San Bernardino|downtown]]. This fact accounts for a historically high water table in portions of the city, including at the former Urbita Springs, a lake which no longer exists and is now the site of the [[Inland Center]] Mall. Seccombe Lake, named after a former mayor, is a [[Water reservoir|manmade lake]] at Sierra Way and 5th Street. The San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District ("Muni") has plans to build two more large, multi-acre lakes north and south of historic downtown in order to reduce groundwater, mitigate the risks of liquefaction in a future earthquake, and sell the valuable water to neighboring agencies.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The city has several notable hills and mountains; among them are [[Shandin Hills|Perris Hill]] (named after Fred Perris, an early engineer, and the namesake of [[Perris, California]]); [[Shandin Hills|Kendall Hill]] (which is near California State University); and Little Mountain, which rises among [[Shandin Hills]] (generally bounded by Sierra Way, 30th Street, Kendall Drive, and [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]).

Freeways act as significant geographical dividers for the city of San Bernardino. Interstate 215 is the major east-west divider, while [[State Route 210 (California)|State Route 210]] is the major north-south divider. [[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]] is in the southern part of the city. Other major highways include [[State Route 206 (California)|State Route 206]] (Kendall Drive and E Street); [[State Route 66 (California)|State Route 66]] (which includes the former U.S. 66); [[State Route 18 (California)|State Route 18]] (from State Route 210 north on Waterman Avenue to the northern [[City limits]] into the mountain communities), and [[California State Route 259|State Route 259]], the freeway connector between State Route 210 and I-215.

===Climate===
[[File:Sbsnow 2.jpg|thumb|January snowfall in San Bernardino with [[Shandin Hills]] in the background. near [[Verdemont, San Bernardino, California|Verdemont]] and the [[University District, San Bernardino|University District]]]]
San Bernardino features a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]) with mild winters and hot, dry summers. Relative to other areas in Southern California, winters are colder, with frost and with chilly to cold morning temperatures common. The particularly arid climate during the summer prevents tropospheric clouds from forming, meaning temperatures rise to what is considered by NOAA scientists as Class Orange. Summer thus has temperatures approaching those typical of  hot desert climates,  with the highest recorded summer temperature at 118&nbsp;°F (47.8&nbsp;°C) on July 6, 2018.<ref name= Weather.com >{{cite web

}}</ref> In the winter, snow flurries occur upon occasion. San Bernardino gets an average of {{convert|16|in|mm|0}} of rain, hail, or light snow showers each year. [[Arrowhead Springs]], San Bernardino's northernmost neighborhood gets snow, heavily at times, due to its elevation of about {{convert|3000|ft|m}} above sea level.

The seasonal [[Santa Ana wind]]s are felt particularly strongly in the San Bernardino area as warm and dry air is channeled through nearby [[Cajon Pass]] at times during the autumn months. This phenomenon markedly increases the wildfire danger in the foothills, canyon, and mountain communities that the cycle of cold, wet winters and dry summers helps create.

According to the [[LA Times]] San Bernardino County has highest levels of [[Tropospheric ozone|ozone]] in the United States, averaging 102 parts per billion.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-what-new-smog-rules-mean-for-california-air-pollution-20150930-story.html New attack on California's dirty air]

Western, central, and parts of eastern San Bernardino are home to mixed-ethnic working class populations, of which the Latino and African-American populations comprise the vast majority of the city.

==Economy==
Government, retail, and [[Service industry|service industries]] dominate the economy of the city of San Bernardino. From 1998 to 2004, San Bernardino's economy grew by 26,217 jobs, a 37% increase, to 97,139. Government was both the largest and the fastest-growing employment sector, reaching close to 20,000 jobs in 2004. Other significant sectors were retail (16,000 jobs) and education (13,200 jobs).<ref name="ULI">{{Cite book | last=Advisory Services Panel | title=San Bernardino, California: Crossroads of the Southwest | url=http://www.ci.san-bernardino.ca.us/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=4907 | publisher=[[Urban Land Institute]] | location=Washington, D.C. | date=June 24–29, 2007 | access-date=December 26, 2007}}</ref>

The city's location close to the [[Cajon Pass|Cajon]] and [[San Gorgonio Pass|San Gorgonio]] passes, and at the junctions of the [[I-10]], I-215, and SR-210 freeways, positions it as an intermodal logistics hub. The city hosts the [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]]'s [[intermodal freight transport]] yard, the Yellow Freight Systems' [[cross-docking]] trucking center, and Pacific Motor Trucking. Large warehouses for [[Kohl's]], [[Mattel]], [[Pep Boys]], and [[Stater Bros.]] have been developed near the [[San Bernardino International Airport]].<ref name="ULI" />

Over the last few decades, the city's riverfront district along Hospitality Lane has drawn much of the regional economic development away from the historic [[downtown San Bernardino|downtown]] of the city so that the area now hosts a full complement of office buildings, big-box retailers, restaurants, and hotels situated around the Santa Ana River.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The closing of [[Norton Air Force Base]] in 1994 resulted in the loss of 10,000 military and civilian jobs and sent San Bernardino's economy into a downturn that has been somewhat offset by more recent growth in the intermodal shipping industry. The jobless rate in the region rose to more than 12 percent during the years immediately after the base closing. As of 2007 households within one mile of the city core had a median income of only $20,480, less than half that of the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland region]] as a whole.<ref>{{cite news | last=Brown | first=Josh | title=San Bernardino's base redevelopment efforts take circuitous path | url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/sbcounty/stories/PE_News_Local_D_nortonmain26.2037459.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520021635/http://www.pe.com/localnews/sbcounty/stories/PE_News_Local_D_nortonmain26.2037459.html | archive-date=May 20, 2011 | publisher=[[Press Enterprise (California)|Press Enterprise]] | date=July 25, 2007 | access-date=December 26, 2007}}</ref> Over 15 percent of San Bernardino residents are unemployed as of 2012, and over 40 percent are on some form of public assistance.<ref name=Willon>{{cite news|last=Willon|first=Phil|title=Plenty of blame on long road to San Bernardino bankruptcy|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-san-bernardino-20120713,0,3298664.story|access-date=July 17, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 12, 2012}}</ref>  According to the US Census, 34.6 percent of residents live below the poverty level, making San Bernardino the poorest city for its population in California, and the second poorest in the US next to Detroit.<ref name="Romero">{{cite news|last=Romero|first=Dennis|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/10/san_bernardino_poor_poverty_so.php|title=America's Second Poorest Big City is Right Here in Southern California: San Bernardino|date=October 17, 2011|newspaper=LA Weekly|access-date=July 12, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221161854/http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/10/san_bernardino_poor_poverty_so.php|archive-date=December 21, 2011}}</ref>{{Update|section|date=May 2015}}

[[File:San Bernardino City Hall, 2009.JPG|thumb|San Bernardino City Hall building in [[downtown San Bernardino|downtown]], was designed in 1963 by [[César Pelli]]]]
The city of San Bernardino is a [[charter city]], a form of government under California that allows limited home-rule, in that it can pass its own laws not in conflict with state law, such as when state law is silent, or expressly allows municipal regulations of areas of local concern. San Bernardino became a charter city in 1905, the most current charter was passed in 2016.

The city of San Bernardino is a [[council-manager]] city with a full-time mayor elected by the city at large. The council consists of seven wards which are elected to four-year terms. The charter also created the [[San Bernardino City Unified School District]], a legally separate agency, and the Board of Water Commissioners, a semi-autonomous, but legally indistinct commission, and a Board of Library Trustees. The City Manager is responsible for all department heads, except for the fire and police chiefs. Previously, the San Bernardino Municipal Code recognized a City Administrator.

When the city originally adopted a ward system, there were five wards. In the 1960s, the Council was expanded to seven wards. The boundaries are adjusted with each federal census. The current council is:<ref name=officials/>
* Mayor: John Valdivia
* First Ward: Theodore Sanchez
* Second Ward: Sandra Ibarra
* Third Ward: Juan Figueroa
* Fourth Ward: Fred Shorrett
* Fifth Ward: Henry Nickel
* Sixth Ward: Bessine L. Richard
* Seventh Ward: James L. Mulvihill

As per California law, all city positions are [[nonpartisan]]. [[Bob Holcomb]] (1922–2010) was the longest-serving mayor of San Bernardino to date, holding the office from 1971 until 1985 and again from 1989 to 1993.<ref name=sbs>{{cite news|first=James Rufus|last=Koren|title=Ex-mayor of San Bernardino dies at 88|url=http://www.sbsun.com/ci_16738877?source=most_viewed|work=[[The San Bernardino Sun]]|date=November 29, 2010|access-date=December 11, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314032949/http://www.sbsun.com/ci_16738877?source=most_viewed|archive-date=March 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=cct>{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Edwards |title=Former SB mayor W.R.

San Bernardino's legal community has two centers: downtown and Hospitality Lane. Criminal, family, and government lawyers are centered downtown, while local civil firms and outposts of state and national firms, corporate, and insurance defense firms, are located along Hospitality Lane.

Citizens of Mexico can obtain a [[Matrícula Consular]], which many governments and businesses use in lieu of U.S. [[photo identification]].

====Bankruptcy====
On July 10, 2012, the City Council of San Bernardino decided to seek protection under [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code]], making it the third California municipality to do so in less than two weeks (after [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] and the town of [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]]), and the second-largest ever.  According to state law, the city would normally have to negotiate with creditors first, but, because they declared a fiscal emergency in June, that requirement did not apply.<ref name="CBS20120711" >{{cite web|title=3rd Calif. city to file for bankruptcy in 1 month|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57469953/3rd-calif-city-to-file-for-bankruptcy-in-1-month/|publisher=CBS News|access-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref><ref name="BW20120817">{{cite news|last=Church|first=Steven|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-17/san-bernardino-bankruptcy-judge-sets-oct-dot-24-deadline|title=San Bernardino Bankruptcy Judge Sets Oct. 24 Deadline|date=August 17, 2012|newspaper=BloombergBusinessWeek|access-date=August 21, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720043313/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-17/san-bernardino-bankruptcy-judge-sets-oct-dot-24-deadline|archive-date=July 20, 2014}}</ref> The case was filed on August 1.<ref name="Rtrs20120802">{{cite news|last=Reid|first=Tim|title=San Bernardino, California, files for bankruptcy with over $1 billion in debts|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/02/us-usa-bankrupty-san-bernardino-idUSBRE87105220120802|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=September 5, 2012|date=2012-08-02}}</ref>

====Municipal code====
As a [[charter city]], San Bernardino may make and enforce its own laws as long as they are not in conflict with the laws of the State of California. These rules have been codified as the [http://sbcity.org/residents/municipal_code.asp San Bernardino Municipal Code]. Violations of the code, punishable as a [[misdemeanor]] or [[infraction]] (or both) are prosecuted by the City Attorney's Office in the [http://www.sb-court.org/ San Bernardino County Superior Court]. The city also has two administrative processes for violations of the code, as well as other adopted codes, like the [[California Building Standards Code#Parts|California Building Code]] and the [[California Building Standards Code#Parts|California Fire Code]]. One process is an administrative citation system, similar to a [[Parking violation|parking ticket]], with a pay or contest procedure. The other is an [[Hearing (law)|administrative hearing]] process, generally used by the Code Enforcement Department for prosecuting multiple code violations.

====Downtown San Bernardino revitalization efforts====

[[Image: San Bernardino Main Post Office 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Historic downtown post office]]

In June 2009, the city's Economic Development Agency, presented the San Bernardino City Council with the Downtown Core Vision/Action Plan<ref>{{cite web |author=City of San Bernardino EDA, Pirih Productions, and Brostrom Software Solutions |url=http://www.sbrda.org/corevision.htm |title=Downtown Core Vision |publisher=Sbrda.org |access-date=December 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009125146/http://www.sbrda.org/corevision.htm |archive-date=October 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>– a guide for revitalizing Downtown San Bernardino for the next 10 years. The plan, which the city council approved to support, is the culmination of a year of research, community participation, and planning led by the city's EDA and the urban planning firm EDAW which has worked on master planning across the globe for downtown areas that include Milan, Italy; London, England; New York, New York; and Denver, Colorado, to name a few.

A driving force in the initial phase of the revitalization efforts is the development of an arts and culture district in the heart of Downtown San Bernardino.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} This effort is being anchored by the historic and iconic California Theatre,<ref name="californiatheatre.net"/> which has been in continuous operation since first opening its doors in 1928. California-based Maya Cinemas, which is adjacent to California Theatre, is in the process of renovating the former CinemaStar movie theatre. These two entertainment facilities are the foundation of what will become a vibrant center for the arts and culture.

===Joint-power authorities===
San Bernardino shares certain powers with other agencies to form legally separate entities known as joint-power authorities under California law. These include [[Omnitrans]], which provides transportation throughout the east and west valleys of San Bernardino County, SANBAG, which coordinates transportation projects throughout the county, and the Inland Valley Development Agency, which is responsible for redevelopment of the areas around the [[San Bernardino International Airport]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===County seat===
[[File:San Bernardino County Court House.JPG|right|thumb|San Bernardino County Court House, built in 1926.]]
San Bernardino is the [[county seat]] of [[San Bernardino County]], the largest organized county in the contiguous United States by area, but smaller than several [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|boroughs and census areas in Alaska]]. Various [[State court (United States)|state courts]] (for civil, criminal and juvenile trials) operate under the auspices of the [[Superior court|Superior Court]], San Bernardino District (formerly Central Division prior to the unification of the Superior and Municipal Courts in 1998). Currently, the [[Superior Court of California]] county courthouse is located at 351 North Arrowhead Avenue. It consists of a four-story building of steel and concrete construction built in 1927. A six-story addition was added in the 1950s. Currently, the 1926 structure is being retrofitted.  A new courthouse, located at 247 West Third Street, opened in 2014, which houses civil courts.

Juvenile Court and Juvenile Hall are located in a county enclave adjacent to the city on Gilbert Street, near the site of the former County Hospital.

The County's [[District attorney|District Attorney]] and the Public Defender both have their main offices on Mountain View Avenue, directly east of the Courthouse.

The [[California Court of Appeal]] Fourth District, Division Two used to be located in San Bernardino, but moved to Riverside in the 1990s. Federal cases (including Bankruptcy) are also heard in Riverside courthouses.

[[File:San Bernardino County Arrowhead Plaza.jpg|right|thumb|San Bernardino County Government Center, 385 North Arrowhead Avenue in [[downtown San Bernardino]]]]

===Public safety===
The 1905 Charter created the San Bernardino Police Department and chief of police; before 1905, there was a position of city marshal. The current charter places the chief of police under the direction of the mayor.

The San Bernardino City Fire Department was founded in 1878 and dissolved on July 1, 2016, to be taken over by the San Bernardino County Fire District.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.san-bernardino.ca.us/depts/fire/stations.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305184545/http://www.ci.san-bernardino.ca.us/depts/fire/stations.asp |archive-date=March 5, 2007 |title=San Bernardino City Fire Department. ''Stations'' |publisher=Ci.san-bernardino.ca.us |access-date=December 10, 2011}}</ref>

Charter Section 186 requires that the monthly salaries of police and fire local safety members be the average of like positions at ten comparable cities in California.<ref>City of San Bernardino, Charter section 186, San Bernardino Municipal Code section 1.28.020</ref> Thus, if the average goes up in other cities, the compensation of the local safety employees automatically rises.

Over 90 percent of local police officers do not live within the city limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackvoicenews.com/commentary/hardy-l-brown/40592-editorials-by-hardy-brown.html |title=Brinker, Derry, Kelley & McCammack 'Wrapped Up, Tied Up, Tangled Up' . . .

San Bernardino is part of the Los Angeles Nielsen area. As such, most its residents receive the same local television and radio stations as residents of Los Angeles. [[KVCR-DT]], a PBS affiliate operated by the San Bernardino Community College District, is the only local San Bernardino television station. [[KPXN]], the Los Angeles Ion Television network affiliate, is licensed to San Bernardino, but contains no local content. Most of the northern section of San Bernardino cannot receive over-the-air [[Broadcasting|television broadcasts]] from Los Angeles because [[Mount San Antonio|Mount Baldy]], and other San Gabriel Mountain peaks, block transmissions from [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]]. Since the 1960s, most North San Bernardino residents have required cable television to obtain television. Today, the city has one main cable franchise: the city has [[Charter Communications]]. Mountain Shadow Cable is a small local company that provides services to the eponymous mobile home park. DBS satellite also has a presence. Local programming is handled by the city's [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) cable TV channel KCSB-TV.

Historically, San Bernardino has had a number of newspapers. Today, the ''[[San Bernardino Sun]]'', founded in 1894 (but was the continuation of an earlier paper) publishes in North San Bernardino, and has a circulation area roughly from Yucaipa to Fontana, including the mountain communities. Many older residents refer to the Sun as the Sun-Telegram, its name when it merged with the afternoon Telegram in the 1960s. The Precinct Reporter has been publishing weekly since 1965, primarily serving African American residents. Its circulation also includes Riverside County and Pomona Valley. There is also the ''Black Voice News'' that previously served Riverside has been in the area over 30 years and has more recently served African Americans that live in the community. Another local newspaper centered mostly around the African American community is the ''Westside Story Newspaper'', established in 1987. Their coverage area extends to the greater area of [[San Bernardino County]]. They currently operate locally and online.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The ''Inland Catholic Byte'' is the newspaper of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino]]. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' is also widely circulated.

The [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]] also has its own Arbitron area. Therefore, there are several radio stations that broadcast in San Bernardino or other Inland Empire cities. These include top 40 station [[KHTI]], country music station [[KFRG]], [[NPR]] member station [[KVCR (FM)|KVCR]] and news/talk/music station KCAA 1050 AM, with studios in the Carousel Mall. Other than government or media outlets, there is no major internet site made for the Inland Empire.
