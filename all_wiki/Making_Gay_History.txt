'''''Making Gay History''''' is an [[oral history]] podcast on the subject of [[LGBT history]], featuring trailblazers, activists, and allies. Most episodes draw on the three-decade-old audio archive of rare interviews that the podcast's founder and host [[Eric Marcus]] conducted for the two editions of his oral history book about the LGBT movement, which he was commissioned to write in the late 1980s. In February 2020, ''Making Gay History'' was adapted for the stage at [[New York University]]'s [[Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2020/february/educational-theatre-making-gay-history.html|title=NYU Steinhardt's Educational Theatre Production 'Making Gay History: Before Stonewall' Turns the Popular Podcast into a Play|publisher=New York University|date=February 19, 2020}}</ref>

== Background ==
The first edition of the book, published in 1992 under the title ''Making History''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Making history : the struggle for gay and lesbian equal rights, 1945-1990|last=Marcus, Eric.|date=2018|publisher=HarperImpulse|isbn=978-0-06-284826-0|location=London|oclc=1041619749}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-016708-0|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Making History: The Struggle for Gay and Lesbian Equal Rights, 1945-1990: An Oral History by Eric Marcus, Author HarperCollins Publishers $25 (532p) ISBN 978-0-06-016708-0|website=PublishersWeekly.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> was a [[Stonewall Book Award]] winner in 1992 and was described by acclaimed oral historian [[Studs Terkel]] as “[o]ne of the definitive works on gay life.”

In the late 1990s, Marcus undertook another round of interviews for the updated second edition of the book, entitled ''Making Gay History'' (2002). 

In 2016, Marcus revisited the archive of his original recordings, which had since been digitized by the [[New York Public Library]], along with executive producer Sara Burningham, who suggested that the interviews be used as the basis for a podcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://makinggayhistory.com/about/|title=About Making Gay History|website=Making Gay History}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2017/06/12/three-podcasts-that-explore-queer-history-identity-and-intimacy/ |title=Three podcasts that explore queer history, identity and intimacy |work=The Washington Post |date=2017-06-12 |accessdate=2020-01-05}}</ref>    

Since its launch in October 2016, the podcast has featured interviews with [[transgender rights]] icon [[Sylvia Rivera]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://makinggayhistory.com/podcast/episode-1-1/|title=Episode 01 — Sylvia Rivera|website=Making Gay History}}</ref> pioneering lesbian writer Edythe D. Eyde aka [[Lisa Ben]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://makinggayhistory.com/podcast/episode-1-3/|title=Episode 03 — Edythe Eyde|website=Making Gay History}}</ref> American comedian, talk show host, and actress [[Ellen DeGeneres]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://makinggayhistory.com/podcast/ellen-degeneres/|title=Ellen DeGeneres|website=Making Gay History}}</ref> popular advice columnist and LGBT advocate [[Pauline Phillips]] ("Dear Abby");<ref>{{cite web|url=https://makinggayhistory.com/podcast/episode-01-08/|title=Episode 08 — Dear Abby|website=Making Gay History}}</ref> and others. It has also drawn on other audio archives to highlight the contributions of activists like [[Ernestine Eckstein]] and [[Bayard Rustin]], and has used contemporary interviews to chronicle the life and work of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and [[Reed Erickson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://makinggayhistory.com/podcast/magnus-hirschfeld/|title=Magnus Hirschfeld|website=Making Gay History}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://makinggayhistory.com/podcast/reed-erickson/|title=Reed Erickson|website=Making Gay History}}</ref> In December 2019, they released the earliest known recording of Sylvia Rivera and [[Marsha P. Johnson]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-29|title=Earliest Known Recording of Marsha P.

For the eighth season of the podcast, Marcus partnered with the [[Studs Terkel Radio Archive]] to release interviews conducted by the legendary radio host and oral historian, [[Studs Terkel]]. Marcus sites Terkel and his work as inspiration for his own saying, "Growing up with lefty parents, I was already familiar with Terkel’s popular radio show and writings. His outspoken support of liberal causes, from unions and the Black civil rights movement to gay rights and women’s rights, inspired me then, and his legacy inspires me to this day. It’s a privilege to be able to share the work of this staunch and early straight ally with our listeners.”<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gay history podcast has new host: Studs Terkel - LGBT News - Windy City Times|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Gay-history-podcast-has-new-host-Studs-Terkel/69298.html|access-date=2020-10-23|website=www.windycitymediagroup.com}}</ref>
