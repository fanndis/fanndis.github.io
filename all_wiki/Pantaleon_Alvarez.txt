==Issues==

=== Prejudicial policy making and leadership ===
In finalizing the General Appropriations Act of 2018, Alvarez and his allies deliberately withheld infrastructure funding from the members of congress whom they find "undesirable". Alvarez states that it's unfair for the members who cooperate with him and the President to receive funding less than those representatives. The total amount of funds reallocated to cooperative members is suspected to amount to 11 Billion Pesos. When asked about the welfare of those regions who will be negatively affected by the reallocation of the budget, Alvarez was unapologetic and told the affected citizens in the regions to blame their constituents for the retaliatory budget cuts. Various members of the congress were alarmed and pointed out the dictatorial and vengeful nature of the Duterte administration and the alacrity in the leadership of Alvarez in perpetuating it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/953912/alvarez-undesirable-lawmakers-lost-infra-funding-due-to-politics|title=Alvarez: 'Undesirable' lawmakers lost infra funding due to politics|last=Yap|first=DJ|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}</ref>

Alvarez has threatened congressmen and various governmental agencies that they would received zero budget if they don't support Rodrigo Duterte's plans to overthrow the Republic of the Philippines by implementing PDP–Laban's Federalism Government. Alvarez stated that he does not care whether the provinces, agencies and local governments affected by his budget cuts would suffer and told the people to blame their representatives instead who refused to follow what Duterte wants. Senator Aquilino "Nene" Pimentel Jr. warned Alvarez that "nobody stays in power forever", insinuating that Alvarez will receive his [[just deserts]] after his blatant abuse of power and authority.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/962030/breaking-pimentel-jr-tells-alvarez-nobody-stays-in-power-forever|title=Pimentel Jr. tells Alvarez: Nobody stays in power forever|last=Ballaran|first=Jhoanna|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}</ref>

=== "Persona Non-Grata" in PDP–Laban ===
In August 2017, Alvarez was declared "Persona Non Grata" by his own party mates in PDP Laban, Rogelio Garcia and Cesar Cuntapay, stating that Alvarez actions in reorganizing the party nationwide without authority and recruiting new members in exchange for favors severely damaged the party's credibility and Duterte's own legitimacy in his war against drugs. Benito Ranque, PDP–Laban deputy secretary general, states that the new members are not even educated or informed of the party's constitution and by-laws, in support of Cuntapay's accusations. There were also reports that the new politicians that Alvarez recruited are "narco-politicians", involved in illegal drugs manufacturing and trafficking. Senate President Aquilino "Koko" Pimentel III, PDP–Laban's president, however, denied the reports that Alvarez is persona-non-grata despite the numerous PDP–Laban members disdain for Alvarez and his insubordinate actions which violated PDP–Laban's own constitution and by-laws. Pimentel retaliated against Garcia and Cuntapay by ordering them silenced or be disciplined. Alvarez stated that "grumbling members" should either leave or he will "take care" of them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/925593/senate-president-koko-pimentel-speaker-pantaleon-alvarez-pdp-laban-persona-non-grata-denial|title=Pimentel denies report Speaker is ‘persona non grata’ at PDP–Laban party|last=Ballaran|first=Jhoanna|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://durianburgdavao.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/pdp-laban-declares-alvarez-as-persona-non-grata/|title=PDP–Laban declares Alvarez as ‘persona non grata’|date=2017-08-28|work=THE DURIAN POST BY ROGER "DURIANBURGDAVAO" BALANZA|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/926597/pdp-laban-officials-to-grumbling-members-toe-the-line-or-leave|title=PDP–Laban officials to grumbling members: Toe the line or leave|last=Lim|first=Frinston|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}</ref>

===Alleged Graft in PIATCO-Fraport NAIA 3 deal===
In 2005, Alvarez along with four other former DOTC officials were charged with graft before the [[Sandiganbayan]] in connection with the construction of [[NAIA Terminal 3]]. In 2010, the charges were dismissed by the Sandiganbayan Special Second Division due to lack of evidence.<ref name="gmaprofile" /><ref name="casedismissal">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/205083/news/nation/4-ex-govt-officials-in-naia-3-graft-case-cleared|title=4 ex-govt officials in NAIA-3 graft case cleared|date=November 3, 2010|accessdate=July 25, 2016|publisher=[[GMA News]]}}</ref><ref name="newsbreak" /><ref name="rapplernaia3">{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/132878-pantaleon-alvarez-house-speaker-naia-3|title=Next Speaker?

Pantaleon Alvarez allegedly used information gained by his position to preempt the bidding process by creating a company called Wintrack which the board awarded a major sub-contract for the project's site development and excavation work. Alvarez and other member of the Piatco and Fraport became board members of Wintrack, benefiting and amassing profits from the deal. The staggering income gotten by Wintrack from the deal has prompted the Ombudsman to file a case of graft against Alvarez and his cohorts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/another-page-turns-terminal-3-saga-2/149830/|title=Another page turns in the Terminal 3 saga - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-19}}</ref>

=== Martial law in Mindanao ===
Alvarez was an advocate for the [[secession]] of all of [[Mindanao]] from the Philippines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/786414/peace-talks-back-to-square-one |title=Peace talks back to square one |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=May 19, 2016 |accessdate=July 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.pia.gov.ph/?m=12&fi=p050714.htm&no=1 |title=Leaders to push for Mindanao independence incase of power grab |publisher=Philippine Information Agency |date=July 14, 2005 |accessdate=July 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://politics.com.ph/bebot-alvarez-is-favorite-to-be-house-speaker-in-duterte-administration/ |title=Pantaleon Alvarez is picked to be Duterte’s Speaker but Karlo Nograles is a close 2nd |publisher=Politics.com.ph |date= |accessdate=July 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/279096 |title=Sultan Rejects Secession of Mindanao |publisher=[[Arab News]] |date=January 18, 2006 |accessdate=July 5, 2016}}</ref>

He is in favor of extending the [[Proclamation No. 216|martial law]] in Mindanao until 2022, the end of Rodrigo Duterte's term, citing the threat of terrorism and insurgency in Mindanao.

=== Abolition of Court of Appeals ===
Alvarez has threatened to dissolved the Court of Appeals and to disbar CA Special Fourth Division, Stephen Cruz, Edwin Sorongon and Nina Antonino-Valenzuela, for granting the habeas corpus petition of six Ilocos Norte officials under their custody for the investigation regarding the "Tobacco Funds" issue. Alvarez in a radio interview said, “They are not even our co-equal branch… They are merely a creation of Congress—that Court of Appeals. They only exist because they were created by Congress. Any time, we can dissolve them. So they better start thinking,”.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/906088/speaker-alvarez-threatens-to-dissolve-court-of-appeals|title=Speaker Alvarez threatens to dissolve Court of Appeals|last=Yap|first=DJ|date=June 16, 2017|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date=August 7, 2017}}</ref>

Alvarez had repeatedly publicly campaigned for the abolition of the Court of Appeals, stating that the said court only allowed lawyers to use delaying tactics and gives corrupt judges ways to abuse their power. He stated that in the federalism set-up he's proposing, he will create special courts that will allow him to dispense speedier "justice".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/946765/speaker-seeks-abolition-of-court-of-appeals-under-federal-setup|title=Speaker seeks abolition of Court of Appeals under federal setup|last=Avendaño|first=Christine O.|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}</ref>

=== Influence peddling & "imbecile" Facebook post ===
Alvarez has been accused of peddling influence in the Bureau of Customs by Mandy Anderson, a Bureau of Customs official. Anderson revealed that Alvarez had been using his position as a lawmaker to urge Faeldon, the BoC commissioner, to appoint Alvarez's recommendations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/619796/boc-staff-in-imbecile-post-alvarez-threatened-to-give-me-hell-for-not-promoting-unqualified-employee/story/|title=BOC staff: Alvarez threatened to give me hell for not promoting ‘unqualified’ employee|last=Colcol|first=Erwin|date=July 29, 2017|website=GMA News}}</ref> The accusation came after Mandy Anderson had been criticized and scolded in a congressional hearing by Majority Leader, Farinas, due to a Facebook status message, wherein she called Alvarez an "imbecile" for threatening to dissolve the court of appeals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/176814-faeldon-chief-of-staff-grilled-alvarez-imbecile|title=Faeldon's Chief of Staff, grilled for calling Alvarez an "Imbecile"|last=Cepeda|first=Mara|date=July 26, 2017|website=Rappler}}</ref> Alvarez has refuted Anderson's claims, saying that he does not know the Customs Officers whose promotion he endorsed and he only knew him through his resume.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/919722/alvarez-i-endorsed-customs-officers-promotion-because-hes-overqualified|title=Alvarez endorsed customs officers because he's overqualified|last=Yap|first=DJ|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}</ref>

===Marriage dissolution bill===
Álvarez, along with 14 co-authors, had formally filed House Bill No. 6027, titled "An Act Providing for Grounds for the Dissolution of a Marriage". The bill lists irreconcilable differences or severe and chronic unhappiness causing the "irreparable breakdown of marriage" as the possible grounds for its dissolution. The bill prescribes imprisonment of 5 years in prison if spouse is forced to petition for "marriage dissolution".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/920798/alvarez-has-opposition-solons-as-co-authors-in-marriage-dissolution-bill|title=Alvarez has opposition solons as co-authors in marriage dissolution bill|last=Nonato|first=Vince|date=August 6, 2017}}</ref> After news of the filing, Alvarez's wife breaks her silence and revealed her grievances regarding her marriage with Alvarez, revealing that she has long since known that Alvarez had been cheating on her countless times. That it was only during after he became Speaker that Alvarez had completely broke off relations with her.

In an interview, Emelita Alvarez said “Actually I was abandoned right after Sona when he became the Speaker. We’ve been together for almost 30 years and I’ve been there since the very start that was in ’88. We’ve been through ups and downs, I’m there and people of Davao del Norte will testify that I was even the one who campaigned for him but anyway life should go on”.

Emelita Alvarez also refuted her husband's claim that he's from the Manobo tribe, wherein polygamy is allegedly acceptable. She states that Alvarez was clearly a Catholic when she married him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/918461/philippine-news-updates-speaker-pantaleon-alvarez-emelita-alvarez-marriage|title=Speaker Alvarez’ wife breaks silence|last=Nonato|first=Vince|date=July 28, 2017|website=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}</ref>

=== Impeachment efforts against the Vice President and Chief Justice ===
Alvarez has been known for facilitating and endorsing impeachment efforts against Vice President, Robredo and Supreme Court Chief Justice, Sereno. Alvarez's endorsed impeachment complaint against Robredo came after the Vice President reported to the United Nations the state of the country and the War on Drugs that President Duterte's administration is currently conducting. Alvarez claims that Robredo's act of portraying the country in a bad light is a betrayal of public trust, and thus impeachable.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/881648/alvarez-eyes-impeachment-rap-vs-robredo-this-time|title=Alvarez eyes impeachment rap vs Robredo this time|last=Cayabyab|first=Marc Jayson|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}</ref> Alvarez has also revealed that the congress will be discussing possible impeachment complaint against Chief Justice Sereno for meddling in the case of the Congress' detention of Ilocos-6, wherein Sereno granted the right of habeas corpus to the six individuals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/910347/alvarez-considering-possible-impeachment-of-sereno-over-ca-issue|title=Alvarez considering possible impeachment of Sereno over CA issue|last=Arnaiz|first=Jani|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}</ref>

=== Death penalty advocate ===
Alvarez had been a staunch supporter of reviving capital punishment, despite the United Nations' moratorium on death penalties, even going so far as to threaten the "dismissal" of representatives who refused to sign the death penalty bill.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/160804-alvarez-house-leaders-against-death-penalty-replaced|title=Alvarez: House leaders vs death penalty will be replaced|work=Rappler|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/01/17/17/speaker-alvarez-confident-death-penalty-bill-will-get-swift-ok-in-house|title=Speaker Alvarez confident death penalty bill will get swift OK in House|last=News|first=RG Cruz, ABS-CBN|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-US}}</ref> Alvarez also advocates and encourages the killing of criminals, following the Duterte administration's zero tolerance policy on crimes and corruption.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/867231/alvarez-shoot-criminals-on-sight|title=Alvarez: Shoot criminals on sight|last=Cayabyab|first=Marc Jayson|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}</ref>

=== Animosity against the Catholic Church ===
Alvarez has been a vocal critic of the Catholic Church for opposing the death penalty bill and the Duterte's administration's War on Drugs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/155511-alvarez-church-death-penalty-why-protect-evil|title=Alvarez on Church opposition to death penalty: 'Why protect evil?'|work=Rappler|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/868443/alvarez-cbcp-has-no-moral-ascendancy-on-drug-war|title=Alvarez: CBCP has no moral ascendancy on drug war|last=Nonato|first=Vince F.|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}</ref> This led to his calls for pro-death penalty Catholics to change religion,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/591467/alvarez-to-catholics-look-for-new-religion-if-shunned-for-backing-death-penalty/story/|title=Alvarez to Catholics: Look for new religion if shunned for backing death penalty|work=GMA News Online|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-US}}</ref> and to propose taxation of Catholic-run schools,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/877942/alvarez-eyes-taxing-church-run-schools|title=Alvarez eyes taxing church-run schools|last=Cayabyab|first=Marc Jayson|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}</ref> despite its expressed exclusion in the Philippine Civil Code.

=== Close ties with the President ===
Alvarez, a longtime ally of President Rodrigo Duterte, became House Speaker right after the PDP–Laban reshuffled after the election results came out.

Since then, Alvarez has backed Duterte on issues, like the Martial Law in Mindanao,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/914792/speaker-alvarez-leads-allies-in-supporting-martial-law-extension|title=Speaker Alvarez leads allies in supporting martial law extension|last=Cayabyab|first=Marc Jayson|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}</ref> the postponement of Barangay Elections,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.ph/news/national/232671/alvarez-supports-barangay-polls-delay.html|title=Alvarez supports barangay polls delay|work=Manila Standard|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}</ref> and Duterte's War on Drugs, which he even promoted to the ASEAN.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/616991/support-duterte-s-war-on-drugs-alvarez-tells-asean-lawmakers/story/|title=Support Duterte's war on drugs, Alvarez tells ASEAN lawmakers|work=GMA News Online|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-US}}</ref>

There is general consensus that as long as Duterte is in power, Alvarez will remain a House Speaker.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/165961-duterte-backing-alvarez-remain-speaker|title=With Duterte's backing, Alvarez will remain Speaker – lawmakers|work=Rappler|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}</ref>

Many critics have expressed that other than having close ties with the President, Alvarez is ill-suited for his position as a Speaker, due to his ineffectiveness in uniting the house to pass bills on critical issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Opinion&title=speaker-pantaleon-alvarez-acerbic-and-arrogant&id=149061|title=Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, acerbic and arrogant|website=www.bworldonline.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>

=== Siargao land purchases ===
The Speaker has also multiple properties in [[Siargao]], a popular tourist town known for its surfing area, with Government records showing that he owns at least 7 properties which have appreciated in value given the increasing popularity of the island.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/philippine-daily-inquirer/20180513/281608126075839|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-05-18}}</ref>  The Speaker, however, defended these land purchases, saying he purchased the properties years ago.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/113262/alvarez-siargao-land-bought-years-ago|title=Alvarez: Siargao land bought years ago|last=INQUIRER.net|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en}}</ref>
