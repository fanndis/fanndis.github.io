In a modern [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] sense, the terms 'Muslim world' and 'Islamic world' refer to [[Islam by country|countries where Islam is widespread]], although there are no agreed criteria for inclusion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/06/02/what-muslim-world/|publisher=Foreign Policy|title=What Muslim World?|author=Scott Carpenter, Soner Cagaptay|date=2 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=BEWH/> Some scholars and commentators have criticised the term 'Muslim/Islamic world' and its derivative terms 'Muslim/Islamic country' as "simplistic" and "binary", since no state has a religiously homogeneous population (e.g. [[Egypt]]'s citizens are c. 10% [[Christians]]), and in absolute numbers, there are sometimes fewer Muslims living in countries where they make up the majority than in countries where they form a minority.<ref name="Radical">{{Cite book |last=Nawaz |first=Maajid |date=2012 |title=Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIjms8hwoW8C |publisher=WH Allen |page=XXII–XIII |isbn=9781448131617 |access-date=19 September 2017}}</ref><ref name="Hitchens"/><ref name="Geling">{{Cite news |url=https://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/ook-na-1400-jaar-kan-de-islam-heus-verdwijnen~bc232725/ |title=Ook na 1400 jaar kan de islam heus verdwijnen |author=Gert Jan Geling |work=Trouw |date=12 January 2017 |access-date=3 October 2017 |language=nl |quote="Many people, including myself, are often guilty of using terms such as 'Muslim countries', or the 'Islamic world', as if Islam has always been there, and always will be.

After Muhammad died in 632, his successors (the [[Caliphs]]) continued to lead the Muslim community based on his teachings and guidelines of the Quran. The majority of Muslims consider the first four successors to be 'rightly guided' or [[Rashidun]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} The [[Muslim conquests|conquests]] of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] helped to [[Spread of Islam|spread Islam]] beyond the Arabian Peninsula, stretching from northwest India, across [[Central Asia]], the [[Near East]], North Africa, southern Italy, and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]]. The Arab Muslims were unable to conquer the entire Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Asia Minor]] during the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]], however. The succeeding [[Umayyad Caliphate]] attempted two failed sieges of [[Constantinople]] in [[Siege of Constantinople (674–678)|674–678]] and [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|717–718]]. Meanwhile, the Muslim community tore itself apart into the rivalling [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia sects]] since the [[Siege of Uthman|killing of caliph Uthman]] in 656, resulting in a [[Succession to Muhammad|succession crisis]] that has never been resolved.<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v.

The best known work of fiction from the Islamic world is ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (In Persian: ''hezār-o-yek šab'' > Arabic: ''ʔalf-layl-at-wa-l’-layla''= One thousand Night and (one) Night) or *''[[Arabian Nights]]'', a name invented by early Western translators, which is a compilation of [[Folklore|folk tales]] from [[Sanskrit]], Persian, and later Arabian [[fable]]s.

A famous{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} example of [[Arabic poetry]] and [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]] on [[romance (love)]] is ''[[Layla and Majnun]]'', dating back to the Umayyad era in the 7th century. It is a [[Tragedy|tragic]] story of undying love. [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the national epic of [[Iran]], is a mythical and heroic retelling of [[History of Iran|Persian history]]. ''[[Amir Arsalan]]'' was also a popular mythical Persian story, which has influenced some modern works of fantasy fiction, such as ''[[The Heroic Legend of Arslan]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

[[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer) and [[Ibn al-Nafis]] were pioneers of the [[Philosophical fiction|philosophical novel]]. Ibn Tufail wrote the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''[[Philosophus Autodidactus]]'') as a response to [[Al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'', and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a novel ''[[Ibn al-Nafis#Theologus Autodidactus|Theologus Autodidactus]]'' as a response to Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''. Both of these narratives had [[protagonist]]s (Hayy in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' and Kamil in ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'') who were [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]] [[feral child]]ren living in seclusion on a [[desert island]], both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone with animals on the desert island for the rest of the story in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in ''Theologus Autodidactus'', developing into the earliest known [[coming of age]] plot and eventually becoming the first example of a science fiction novel.<ref>Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=6 February 2008}}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'').</ref><ref>Nahyan A.

His writings were concerned with various subjects, most notably philosophy and medicine. His medical textbook ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' was used as the standard text in European universities for centuries. He also wrote ''[[The Book of Healing]]'', an influential scientific and philosophical encyclopedia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

One of the most influential Muslim philosophers in the West was Averroes (Ibn Rushd), founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy, whose works and commentaries affected the rise of [[secularism|secular thought]] in Europe.<ref name=Fakhry>Majid Fakhry (2001).

Another figure from the [[Islamic Golden Age]], Avicenna, also founded his own Avicennism school of philosophy, which was influential in both Islamic and Christian lands. He was also a critic of [[Organon|Aristotelian logic]] and founder of Avicennian logic, developed the concepts of [[empiricism]] and [[tabula rasa]], and distinguished between [[essence]] and [[existence]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Yet another influential philosopher who had an influence on [[modern philosophy]] was [[Ibn Tufail]]. His philosophical novel, ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdha]]'', translated into Latin as ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' in 1671, developed the themes of empiricism, tabula rasa, [[nature versus nurture]],<ref>Russell (1994), pp. 224–62,</ref> [[condition of possibility]], [[materialism]],<ref>Dominique Urvoy, "The Rationality of Everyday Life: The Andalusian Tradition?

Muslim scientists placed far greater emphasis on experiment than the [[Greeks]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020|reason=Not mentioned in the Al-Khalili BBC article.}} This led to an early [[scientific method]] being developed in the Muslim world, where progress in methodology was made, beginning with the experiments of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) on [[optics]] from ''circa'' 1000, in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''. The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation, which began among [[List of Muslim scientists|Muslim scientists]]. Ibn al-Haytham is also regarded as the father of optics, especially for his empirical proof of the [[Visual perception#Early studies|intromission theory]] of light. [[Jim Al-Khalili]] stated in 2009 that Ibn al-Haytham is 'often referred to as the "world's first true scientist".'<ref>{{cite news |last=Al-Khalili |first=Jim |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7810846.stm |title=BBC News |date=4 January 2009 |access-date=11 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426041228/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7810846.stm |archive-date=26 April 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[al-Khwarzimi]]'s invented the log base systems that are being used today, he also contributed theorems in trigonometry as well as limits.<ref>Plofker, Kim (2009), Mathematics in India: 500 BCE–1800 CE, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 384., {{ISBN|0-691-12067-6}}.</ref> Recent studies show that it is very likely that the Medieval Muslim artists were aware of advanced [[decagon]]al [[quasicrystal]] geometry (discovered half a millennium later in the 1970s and 1980s in the West) and used it in intricate decorative tilework in the architecture.<ref>Peter J.

Muslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine, including the subjects of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]: such as in the 15th-century Persian work by [[Mansur ibn Ilyas|Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas]] entitled ''Tashrih al-badan'' (''Anatomy of the body'') which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body's structural, [[Nervous system|nervous]] and [[circulatory system]]s; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis, who proposed the theory of [[pulmonary circulation]]. Avicenna's ''The Canon of Medicine'' remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century. [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (also known as ''Abulcasis'') contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his ''[[Al-Tasrif|Kitab al-Tasrif]]'' ("Book of Concessions"), a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries. Other medical advancements came in the fields of [[pharmacology]] and [[pharmacy]].<ref>Turner, H. (1997) pp. 136–38</ref>

In astronomy, [[Muḥammad ibn Jābir al-Ḥarrānī al-Battānī]] improved the precision of the measurement of the [[precession]] of the [[Axial tilt|Earth's axis]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} The corrections made to the [[geocentric model]] by al-Battani, Averroes, [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], [[Mu'ayyad al-Din al-'Urdi]] and [[Ibn al-Shatir]] were later incorporated into the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican heliocentric]] model.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} [[Heliocentrism|Heliocentric]] theories were also discussed by several other [[List of Muslim astronomers|Muslim astronomers]] such as Al-Biruni, [[Al-Sijzi]], [[Qotb al-Din Shirazi]], and [[Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} The [[astrolabe]], though originally developed by the Greeks, was perfected by Islamic astronomers and engineers, and was subsequently brought to Europe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Some most famous scientists from the medieval Islamic world include [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]], [[al-Farabi]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham]], [[Al-Biruni]], [[Avicenna]], [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], and [[Ibn Khaldun]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

====Technology====
[[File:Illustration of al-Hariri Maqamat spinning wheel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Spinning wheel]] is believed to have been invented in the medieval era (of what is now the [[Greater Middle East]]), it is considered to be an important device that contributed greatly to the advancement of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

{{Main|List of inventions in the medieval Islamic world|Arab Agricultural Revolution}}

In technology, the Muslim world adopted [[papermaking]] from China.<ref name=Lucas /> The knowledge of [[gunpowder]] was also transmitted from China via predominantly Islamic countries,<ref>Arming the Periphery.

Advances were made in [[irrigation]] and farming, using new technology such as the [[windmill]]. Crops such as [[almond]]s and [[citrus]] fruit were brought to Europe through [[al-Andalus]], and sugar cultivation was gradually adopted by the Europeans. Arab merchants dominated trade in the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. [[Ormus|Hormuz]] was an important center for this trade. There was also a dense network of [[trade route]]s in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], along which Muslim-majority countries traded with each other and with European powers such as [[Venice]], [[Genoa]] and [[Catalonia]]. The [[Silk Road]] crossing Central Asia passed through Islamic states between China and Europe. The emergence of major economic empires with technological resources after the conquests of [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) and the resurgence of the [[Timurid Renaissance]] include the [[Mali Empire]] and the India's [[Bengal Sultanate]] in particular, a major global trading nation in the world, described by the Europeans to be the "richest country to trade with".<ref>Nanda, J. N (2005). Bengal: the unique state. Concept Publishing Company. p. 10. 2005. {{ISBN|978-81-8069-149-2}}. Bengal [...] was rich in the production and export of grain, salt, fruit, liquors and wines, precious metals and ornaments besides the output of its handlooms in silk and cotton. Europe referred to Bengal as the richest country to trade with.</ref>

Muslim engineers in the Islamic world made a number of innovative industrial uses of [[hydropower]], and early industrial uses of [[tidal power]] and [[wind power]],<ref>[[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]] (1976). ''Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering'', pp. 34–35.

The Great Divergence and British colonialism were the reason why European colonial powers militarily defeated preexisting Oriental powers like the [[Mughal Empire]], starting from the wealthy [[Bengal Subah]], [[Tipu Sultan]]'s [[Kingdom of Mysore]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and many smaller states in the pre-modern [[Greater Middle East]], and initiated a period known as '[[colonialism]]'.<ref name="6KillerApps" />

[[File:World 1914 empires colonies territory.PNG|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Map of colonial powers throughout the world in the year 1914 (note colonial powers in the pre-modern Muslim world).]]

Beginning with the 15th century, [[colonialism]] by European powers (particularly, but not exclusively, [[England|Britain]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]], [[Austria]], and [[Belgium]]) profoundly affected Muslim-majority societies in [[Africa]], [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]]. Colonialism was often advanced by conflict with mercantile initiatives by colonial powers and caused tremendous social upheavals in Muslim-dominated societies.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A number of Muslim-majority societies reacted to Western powers with zealotry and thus initiating the rise of [[Pan-Islamism]]; or affirmed more traditionalist and inclusive cultural ideals; and in rare cases adopted modernity that was ushered by the colonial powers.<ref name="ColonialismLegacies">{{cite book|editor1-last=Levy|editor1-first=Jacob T.|title=Colonialism and Its Legacies|date=2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Group|location=Lanham|others=(Contributors: Alfred T, Chakabarty D, Dussel E, Eze E, Hsueh V, Kohn M, Bhanu Mehta P, Muthu S, Parekh B, Pitts J, Schutte O, Souza J, Young IM) |isbn=9780739142943}}</ref>

The only Muslim-majority regions not to be colonized by the Europeans were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Turkey was one of the first colonial powers of the world with the Ottoman empire ruling several states for over 6 centuries.<!---This unsourced claim is questionable in many aspects. Could we describe the brief occupation of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, etc. by Britain and France as 'colonial'? They were League of Nations mandate territories that were gradually granted autonomy and independence within 40 years. Moreover, shouldn't we classify the pre-European centuries-long occupation of these regions by the Ottoman Empire as 'colonial', too? In fact, that would be more justified than in the Franco-British period. And what to think of Uyghuria and other Central Asian Muslim-majority areas that were conquered/occupied in the 19th and early 20th century by power such as Tsarist Russia and Qing China?--->

Only personal status matters pertaining to inheritance and marriage are governed by [[Sharia]] law.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020|reason=Reliable source needed.

In some places, Muslims implement Islamic law, called sharia in Arabic. The Islamic law exists in a number of variations, but the main forms are the five (four [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and one [[Shia Islam|Shia]]) and Salafi and Ibadi [[Madh'hab|schools of jurisprudence]] ([[fiqh]]){{clarify|what is the following bulletized list in aid of?

In Yemen, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Turkey, and Syria, are countries with Sunni populations. In Lebanon, the majority Muslims (54%) were about equally divided between Sunni and Shia in 2010.

In a [[Hijab by country|number of Muslim-majority countries]] the law requires women to cover either their legs, shoulders and head, or the whole body apart from the face. In strictest forms, the face as well must be covered leaving just a mesh to see through. These [[List of types of sartorial hijab|hijab rules for dressing]] cause tensions, concerning particularly Muslims living in [[Western world|Western]] countries, where restrictions are considered both sexist and oppressive. Some Muslims oppose this charge, and instead declare that the media in these countries presses on women to reveal too much in order to be deemed attractive, and that this is itself sexist and oppressive.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

During much of the 20th century, the Islamic identity and the dominance of Islam on political issues have arguably increased during the early 21st century.

===Religion===
The two main denominations of Islam are the Sunni and Shia sects. They differ primarily upon of how the life of the ummah ("faithful") should be governed, and the role of the [[imam]]. Sunnis believe that the true political successor of the Prophet according to the Sunnah should be selected based on ٍ[[Shura]] (consultation), as was done at [[Saqifah|the Saqifah]] which selected [[Abu Bakr]], Muhammad's father-in-law, to be Muhammad's political but not his religious successor. Shia, on the other hand, believe that Muhammad designated his son-in-law [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] as his true political as well as religious successor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/comparison_charts/islamic_sects.htm |title=Comparison Chart of Sunni and Shia Islam |publisher=ReligionFacts |access-date=24 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429101140/http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/comparison_charts/islamic_sects.htm |archive-date=29 April 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Islamic schools and branches ====
[[File:Madhhab Map2a.png|thumb|upright=1.25|[[madh'hab|Islamic schools of law]] across the Muslim world]]
{{main|Islamic schools and branches}}

The first centuries of Islam gave rise to three major [[Muslim sects|sects]]: [[Sunni]]s, [[Shi'a]]s and [[Kharijites]]. Each sect developed distinct [[Islamic jurisprudence|jurisprudence schools]] (''[[madhhab]]'') reflecting different methodologies of jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'').{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

The major Sunni madhhabs are [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Hanbali]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

The major [[Shi'a]] branches are [[Twelver]] (Imami), [[Ismaili]] (Sevener) and [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] (Fiver). [[Isma'ilism]] later split into [[Nizari Ismaili]] and [[Musta’li Ismaili]], and then [[Mustaali]] was divided into [[Hafizi]] and [[Taiyabi Ismaili]]s.<ref name="Öz1">Öz, Mustafa, ''Mezhepler Tarihi ve Terimleri Sözlüğü (The History of [[madh'hab]]s and its terminology dictionary),'' Ensar Publications, [[İstanbul]], 2011.</ref> It also gave rise to the [[Qarmatian]] movement and the [[Druze]] faith. Twelver Shiism developed [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] whose branches are [[Akhbarism]] and [[Usulism]], and other movements such as [[Alawites]], [[Shayki]]sm<ref name="Meymun">"Muhammad ibn Āliyy’ūl Cillī [[aqidah]]" of "Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī]] [[fiqh]]" (Sūlaiman Affandy, ''Al-Bākūrat’ūs Sūlaiman’īyyah – [[Family tree]] of the [[Nusayri]] [[Tariqat]],'' pp. 14–15, [[Beirut]], 1873.)</ref> and [[Alevism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cemvakfi.org.tr/alevi-islam-din-hizmetleri-baskanligi/alevi-islam-din-hizmetleri-baskanligi/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110124358/http://www.cemvakfi.org.tr/alevi-islam-din-hizmetleri-baskanligi/alevi-islam-din-hizmetleri-baskanligi/|url-status=dead |archive-date=10 January 2012 |title=Alevi İslam Din Hizmetleri Başkanlığı|access-date=5 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Shi'ism">{{Cite book |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-1888-0 |last=Halm |first=Heinz |title=Shi'ism |date=21 July 2004 |page=[https://archive.org/details/shiism0000halm/page/154 154] |title-link=Shi'ism }}</ref>

Similarly, [[Kharijites]] were initially divided into five major branches: [[Sufri]]s, [[Azariqa]], [[Najdat]], Adjarites and [[Ibadis]].

===Refugees===
According to the [[UNHCR]], Muslim-majority countries hosted 18 million refugees by the end of 2010.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Since then Muslim-majority countries have absorbed refugees from recent conflicts, including [[Syrian uprising (2011–present)|the uprising in Syria]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=OIC to hold conference on refugees in Muslim world in Turkmenistan |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-278419-oic-to-hold-conference-on-refugees-in-muslim-world-in-turkmenistan.html |publisher=[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]] |date=24 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503181729/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-278419-oic-to-hold-conference-on-refugees-in-muslim-world-in-turkmenistan.html |archive-date=3 May 2012}}</ref> In July 2013, the UN stated that the number of [[Refugees of the Syrian civil war|Syrian refugees]] had exceeded 1.8 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/07/un-calls-syrian-refugee-crisis-worst-since-rwandan-genocide/ |title=UN Calls Syrian Refugee Crisis Worst Since Rwandan Genocide |publisher=ABC News |date=17 July 2013 |access-date=10 August 2013}}</ref>

==Culture==
Throughout history, Muslim cultures have been diverse ethnically, linguistically and regionally. According to [[Michael Muhammad Knight|M.M. Knight]], this diversity includes diversity in beliefs, interpretations and practices and communities and interests.Knight says perception of Muslim world among non Muslim is usually supported through introductory literature about Islam, mostly present a version as per  scriptural view which would include some [[Islamic advice literature|prescriptive literature]] and abstracts of history as per authors own point of views, to which even many Muslims might agree, but that necessarily would not reflect Islam as lived on the ground, 'in the experience of real human bodies'.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|last=Knight|first=Michael Muhammad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ih13CgAAQBAJ&q=Magic+In+Islam|title=Magic In Islam|date=2016-05-24|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-101-98349-2|pages=Chapter 1|language=en}}</ref>

===Arts===
The term "[[Islamic art]] and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]]" denotes the works of art and architecture produced from the 7th century onwards by people who lived within the territory that was inhabited by culturally Islamic populations.<ref>Ettinghausen (2003), p. 3{{Clarify|date=November 2010|reason=Need full name and work cited}}</ref><ref>"Islamic Art and Architecture", ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'' (2000)</ref>

====Architecture====
{{excerpt|Islamic architecture|only=paragraphs}}

====Aniconism====
{{Main|Aniconism in Islam}}
No Islamic visual images or depictions of [[God in Islam|God]] are meant to exist because it is believed that such artistic depictions may lead to [[idolatry]]. Moreover, Muslims believe that God is [[Spirit|incorporeal]], making any two- or three- dimensional depictions impossible. Instead, Muslims describe God by the [[Names of God in Islam|names and attributes]] that, according to Islam, he revealed to his creation. All but one [[sura]] of the Quran begins with the phrase "[[Basmala|In the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful]]". Images of Mohammed are likewise prohibited. Such [[aniconism]] and [[iconoclasm]]<ref name=MUSLIM-ICONOCLASM>{{cite web

====Arabesque====
{{Main|Arabesque (Islamic art)}}
Islamic art frequently adopts the use of geometrical floral or vegetal designs in a repetition known as [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]. Such designs are highly nonrepresentational, as Islam forbids representational depictions as found in [[Arabian mythology|pre-Islamic pagan religions]]. Despite this, there is a presence of depictional art in some Muslim societies, notably the [[Persian miniature|miniature]] style made famous in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and under the [[Ottoman Empire]] which featured paintings of people and animals, and also depictions of Quranic stories and Islamic traditional narratives. Another reason why Islamic art is usually abstract is to symbolize the transcendence, indivisible and infinite nature of God, an objective achieved by arabesque.<ref name="JAACMadden">Madden (1975), pp. 423–30</ref> [[Islamic calligraphy]] is an omnipresent decoration in Islamic art, and is usually expressed in the form of Quranic verses. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic ''[[kufic]]'' and ''[[Naskh (script)|naskh]]'' scripts, which can be found adorning the walls and domes of [[mosque]]s, the sides of [[minbar]]s, and so on.<ref name="JAACMadden" />

Distinguishing [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] of Islamic architecture have always been ordered repetition, radiating structures, and rhythmic, metric patterns. In this respect, [[fractal]] geometry has been a key utility, especially for mosques and palaces. Other features employed as motifs include columns, [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and arches, organized and interwoven with alternating sequences of niches and colonnettes.<ref>Tonna, Jo (1990). "The Poetics of Arab-Islamic Architecture", Muqarnas BRILL, 7, pp. 182–97</ref> The role of domes in Islamic architecture has been considerable. Its usage spans centuries, first appearing in 691 with the construction of the [[Dome of the Rock]] mosque, and recurring even up until the 17th century with the [[Taj Mahal]]. And as late as the 19th century, Islamic domes had been incorporated into European architecture.<ref>Grabar, Oleg (2006), "Islamic art and beyond". Ashgate. Vol 2, p. 87</ref>
