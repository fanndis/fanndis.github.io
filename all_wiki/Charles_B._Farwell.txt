==Early life ==

He was a son of Henry Farwell (1795–1873) and Nancy ([[née]] Jackson) Farwell (1798–1887).<ref name="White1910">{{cite book |title=The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography: Being the History of the United States as Illustrated in the Lives of the Founders, Builders, and Defenders of the Republic, and of the Men and Women who are Doing the Work and Moulding the Thought of the Present Time |date=1910 |publisher=J.

He attended [[Elmira Academy]] before moving to Illinois in 1838.<ref name="1903Obit"/>

==Career==
He first tried his hand at surveying and farming before moving to [[Chicago]] in 1844, when he went into banking. From 1853 to 1861, he served as the Clerk of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]]. Farwell was "one of the principal builders in [Chicago's] business district" in the last quarter of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forgottenchicago.com/features/bertrand-goldberg-in-tower-town-part-1-bertrand-goldbergs-commune/ |title=Bertrand Goldberg in Tower Town Part 1: Bertrand Goldberg’s Commune |last1=Steffes |first1=Patrick |last2= |first2= |date=31 December 2011 |website=forgottenchicago.com/ |publisher=Forgotten Chicago |accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref>  That he was able to amass a sizeable fortune can be proven by the fact that he owned one of the finest mansions on Chicago's North Side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/I?cdn:1:./temp/~ammem_k7Gr::displayType=1:m856sd=ichicdn:m856sf=n002478:@@@ |title=Charles B.

===Political career===
Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives four times beginning in 1870, winning his first election to the House by a healthy margin over Chicago's "Long" [[John Wentworth (mayor)|John Wentworth]] (by some 5700 votes). Farwell went on to serve in the House of Representatives in the 42nd, 43rd, 44th and 47th Congresses.<ref name="1874Nom">{{cite news |title=Nominating Conventions.; Charles B.

Le Moyne]]'s challenge to Farwell's election and removed Farwell from office; Farwell declined to run again at the time of the general election later on in 1876. In 1880, he was elected to another term in Congress (the 47th Congress). Upon the death of [[John A. Logan]] in 1887, Farwell was elected to serve out Logan's term in the U.S. Senate, but refused to run for re-election to a full term.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/13010?ret=True |title=FARWELL, Charles Benjamin  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=n.d. |website=history.house.gov/ |publisher=Offices of the Historian, Art & Archives, U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=16 May 2014

Significantly, in Farwell's first term as Senator, he supported the introduction of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would have granted [[women's suffrage]] rights (the right to vote) - simultaneously a landmark achievement of and a setback in the long struggle for voting rights for women that would not be overcome until the adoption of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1920.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forgottenchicago.com/features/bertrand-goldberg-in-tower-town-part-1-bertrand-goldbergs-commune/ |title=Bertrand Goldberg in Tower Town Part 1: Bertrand Goldberg’s Commune |last1=Steffes |first1=Patrick |last2= |first2= |date=31 December 2011 |website=forgottenchicago.com/ |publisher=Forgotten Chicago |accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref>

===Later life===
In 1879, Farwell and his brother [[John V. Farwell|John]] were part of a group of Illinois businessmen and politicians responsible for construction of the [[Texas State Capitol]] building. The Farwell's reward for this was to become owners of over 3 million acres of land in Texas, upon which they founded the [[XIT Ranch]]. The city of [[Farwell, Texas]] is named for the Farwell brothers.<ref name="Leonard1908">{{cite book |last1=Leonard |first1=John William |title=Men of America: A Biographical Dictionary of Contemporaries |date=1908 |publisher=L.R.
