{{wikinews|Five police officers killed in Dallas, Texas during sniper attack}}

On July 7, 2016, Micah Xavier Johnson [[ambush]]ed and fired upon a group of police officers in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], killing five officers and injuring nine others. Two civilians were also wounded. Johnson was an [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghan War]] veteran and was angry over police shootings of [[African Americans|black]] men. He stated that he wanted to kill [[white people]], especially white police officers. The shooting happened at the end of a protest against the police killings of [[Shooting of Alton Sterling|Alton Sterling]] in [[Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Shooting of Philando Castile|Philando Castile]] in [[Falcon Heights, Minnesota]], which had occurred in the preceding days.

Following the shooting, Johnson fled inside a building on the campus of [[El Centro College]]. Police followed him there, and a standoff ensued. In the early hours of July 8, police killed Johnson with a [[bomb]] attached to a remote control [[bomb disposal robot]]. It was the first time [[Law enforcement in the United States|U.S. law enforcement]] had used a [[robot]] to kill a suspect.<ref name=Guardian.Identified>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/08/police-bomb-robot-explosive-killed-suspect-dallas|title=Use of police robot to kill Dallas shooting suspect believed to be first in US history|last=Thielman|first=Sam|date=July 8, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=August 8, 2019}}</ref>

The shooting was the deadliest incident for U.S. law enforcement since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], surpassing [[2009 shootings of Oakland police officers|two related March 2009 shootings]] in [[Oakland, California]] and [[2009 Lakewood shooting|a November 2009 ambush shooting]] in [[Lakewood, Washington]], which had each resulted in the death of four police officers and the shooting deaths of both suspects. Many have characterized the attack as an act of [[domestic terrorism]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sterman|first=Peter Bergen and David|title=Dallas: An act of domestic terrorism|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/08/opinions/dallas-domestic-terrorism-bergen/index.html|access-date=2020-10-22|website=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=News|first=A.

Most of the events happened in the streets and buildings around [[El Centro College]], which forms a city block composed of multiple buildings. The block is bordered by Main Street on the south where the protest march was taking place; Lamar Street to the east from where Johnson initiated the shooting spree; and Elm Street to the north where Johnson eventually entered the college.<ref name=DallasNewsHacker>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20160711-el-centro-college-officials-trace-footsteps-of-dallas-police-killer.ece |title=El Centro College officials trace footsteps of Dallas police killer |work=[[Dallas News]] |first=Holly K. |last=Hacker |date=July 12, 2016 |accessdate=July 15, 2016}}</ref>

===Main Street shootings===
Around 8:58&nbsp;p.m. Johnson parked his SUV sideways on Lamar Street, in front of the east entrance to the college, at Building A, and left the vehicle hazard lights blinking.<ref name=DallasNewsHacker/><ref name=DallasObserver.Details>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/police-provide-details-of-shootout-at-el-centro-8504326|title=Police Provide Details of Shootout at El Centro|work=Dallas Observer|date=July 20, 2016|accessdate=July 20, 2016|first=Stephen|last=Young}}</ref> At the time, the street had been cleared out in anticipation of the protest.<ref name=DallasObserver.Details/> Taking cover at street level, he began shooting at groups of police and protesters who were gathered on Main Street.<ref name=WashPost.Lone>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/08/like-a-little-war-snipers-shoot-11-police-officers-during-dallas-protest-march-killing-five/|title=Five Dallas police officers were killed by a lone attacker, authorities say|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 8, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2016|first1=Joel|last1=Achenbach|first2=William|last2=Wan |first3=Mark |last3=Berman |first4=Moriah |last4=Balingit}}</ref><ref name=StarTelegram.Arrested>{{cite web|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/dallas/article88375577.html|title=5 officers killed, others wounded in Dallas shooting; suspects arrested|work=Star-Telegram|date=July 7, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2016|first1=Lee|last1=Williams|first2=Mitch |last2=Mitchell |first3=Ryan |last3=Osborne}}</ref> Johnson was believed to have talked to three of the officers he shot before he first opened fire.<ref name=DallasObserver.Details/>

Immediately afterwards, Johnson made his way north on Lamar Street, encountering Officer Brent Thompson along the way.<ref name=DallasNews.Street/> A civilian recorded video of the encounter from his hotel balcony on Lamar Street. The video showed Johnson, clad in tactical clothing and armed with a rifle, loading his rifle and firing indiscriminately to draw officers near his position. When Thompson approached a corner, Johnson engaged him in a gunfight, forcing Thompson to take cover behind a concrete pillar. Johnson fired towards one side of the pillar, then ran over to the other side of the pillar to flank Thompson and shot him multiple times from behind, killing him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/08/us/dallas-shooting-witness-ismael-dejesus/|title=Dallas shooting eyewitness: "It looked like an execution"|publisher=CNN|date=July 8, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2016|first=Tiffany|last=Ap}}</ref>

===El Centro College shootout===
Johnson, now injured during the firefight, attempted to enter the Lamar Street entrance of the college by shooting out the glass door but was unable to make his way in.<ref name=DallasNewsHacker/> He wounded two campus police officers who were near the doorway inside the building. One was shot in the stomach underneath his [[bulletproof vest]], while the other was hit by flying glass in the legs.<ref name=DallasNews.Glass>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20160710-2-el-centro-college-officers-wounded-when-sniper-shot-through-glass-doors.ece|title=2 El Centro College officers wounded when sniper shot through glass doors|work=The Dallas Morning News|date=July 10, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2016|first=Claire Z.|last=Cardona}}</ref> Johnson then made his way to Elm Street where he shot out another glass door and entered the college unseen; he then made his way to Building B.<ref name=CNN.Unfolded/> Hearing the shattering glass, one of the injured campus officers, Corporal Bryan Shaw, made his way through the building and discovered a trail of blood leading to a stairwell. Accompanied by another police officer, Shaw entered the stairwell and was met with a hail of gunfire coming from above. Unable to see Johnson, he held his fire and retreated with the other officer.<ref name=DallasNewsHacker/><ref name=CNN.Eyes>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/15/health/dallas-shootout-police-perspective/ |title=The Dallas shootout, in the eyes of police|work=CNN|date=July 15, 2016|accessdate=July 15, 2016|first1=Jason|last1=Kravarik |first2=Sara |last2=Sidner}}</ref>

Afterwards, Johnson made his way along a mezzanine between the school's second-floor dining area and third-floor library, but came onto a dead end of windows facing down onto Elm Street. He shot out multiple windows and fired repeatedly at officers on Elm Street. He hit Michael Smith, a police officer standing in front of a [[7-Eleven]], killing him and shattering the store-front glass. Officers began entering the college, sealing escape routes from the building, and evacuating students and teachers in the building, including those on a floor above Johnson, through a different stairwell.<ref name=DallasNewsHacker/><ref name=DallasObserver.Details/><ref name=DallasNews.Street/>

Approaching Johnson on the second floor near the library,<ref name=CNN.Unfolded/> officers found him secured behind a corner firing intermittently.<ref name=DallasNews.RobotWhy/> He was in an area filled with offices and the school's computer servers, with only two doors leading to where he was positioned, and a hallway about {{convert|30|ft|m}} long separating him from [[SWAT]] members.<ref name=DallasObserver.Details/><ref name=CNN.Unfolded>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/20/us/dallas-shooter-micah-johnson-movements/ |title=How the Dallas massacre unfolded|work=CNN|date=July 20, 2016|accessdate=July 20, 2016|first=Ed|last=Lavandera}}</ref> At least 200 gunshots were believed to have been fired by Johnson and SWAT officers in that area during the standoff.<ref name=CNN.Unfolded/>

===Standoff and shooter's death===
Officers opened negotiations for surrender but Johnson said he would speak to black police officers only. Johnson stated that he had acted alone and was not part of any group. According to Chief Brown, Johnson appeared [[delusion]]al during his standoff; "We had negotiated with him for about two hours, and he just basically lied to us, playing games, laughing at us, singing, asking how many did he get and that he wanted to kill some more."

The female soldier told investigators that she and Johnson had been [[wikt:platonic#English|platonic]] friends for five years, but had stopped talking to each other. She described their relationship as being tumultuous and involving fights and disagreements. She specifically recalled one incident where Johnson punched out a car window over her leaving for college and severed an artery, then forced her to bring him to a hospital for treatment. However, Johnson claimed that he punched out the window when the soldier missed a movie they planned to see together, and added that he had been under stress from his job and turbulent home life at the time.<ref name=WFAA.Outburst/><ref name=USAToday.Took>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/08/17/report-shows-army-warned-about-dallas-cop-shooter-micah-johnson/88906532/|title=Report shows that Army took away gun from Dallas cop shooter Micah Johnson|work=USA Today|date=August 17, 2016|accessdate=August 17, 2016|first1=Tom Vanden|last1=Brook|first2=Ray|last2=Locker}}</ref><ref name=WSJ.Taken>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/dallas-shooter-had-firearm-taken-away-during-time-in-army-1471481958 |title=Dallas Shooter Had Firearm Taken Away During Time in Army|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=August 17, 2016|accessdate=August 17, 2016|first=Dan|last=Frosch}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/army-removed-dallas-shooters-weapons-afghanistan-deployment/story?id=41468654|title=Army Removed Dallas Shooter's Weapons During Afghanistan Deployment|work=ABC News|date=August 17, 2016|accessdate=August 17, 2016|first=Luis|last=Martinez}}</ref>

According to the soldier, Johnson asked her for a pair of her underwear before the May 1 incident, but she declined. Also, during a [[Facebook]] conversation with her, Johnson mentioned "tying her down and having her face down on the bed" but then claimed the statement was a joke. Though she told him that rape was "never a joke" and to stop contacting her, the soldier did not report him for harassment at the time because she was used to that kind of rhetoric, as she was frequently around men at home and work.<ref name=WFAA.Outburst/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/5-details-from-the-armys-investigation-of-micah-johnson-8612999|title=5 Details From the Army's Investigation of Micah Johnson|work=Dallas Observer|date=August 19, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2016|first=Stephen|last=Young}}</ref> Though the May 1 incident did not meet the Army's criteria for sexual harassment, investigators found that Johnson's sexually suggestive comments to the female soldier met said criteria.<ref name=WashPost.Behaving/><ref name=WSJ.Points/><ref name=CBS.Accused/><ref name=NPR.Releases/>

Following the inspection, he was disarmed under the recommendation of his platoon sergeant, who felt he posed a potential threat. Another Army official later described the action as unusual, as Johnson did not appear to be visibly agitated or a threat to himself or others at the time.<ref name=USAToday.Took/><ref name=WSJ.Taken/> Johnson was then placed under 24-hour escort, which was reportedly a shameful and ostracizing experience,<ref name=ChicagoTribune.Disgrace/> before being temporarily moved to [[Bagram Airfield]] on May 3, but he did not have enough time to pack all of his belongings. While soldiers were emptying Johnson's quarters and packing his belongings for him on May 14, they discovered an unauthorized single M430I High Explosive Dual Purpose [[40mm grenade]], a [[.50 BMG|.50-caliber]] round, and another soldier's prescription medication in his sleeping bag.<ref name=WashPost.Behaving/><ref name=WSJ.Points/><ref name=WFAA.Outburst/><ref name=NPR.Releases/>

Later, the Army sent Johnson back to the U.S., and according to the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|military lawyer]] who represented Johnson at the time, the Army initiated proceedings to give Johnson an "[[other than honorable discharge|other than honorable]]" discharge. The lawyer claimed this was "highly unusual" because written reprimands are usually issued before more drastic steps are taken, and also because the decision was allegedly based on a single sexual harassment allegation.

Conversely, people familiar with Johnson during his military service believed he may have been severely stressed with serving in a combat zone. They also said he had little interest in the topics of racial injustice and the [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]] that occurred at the time.<ref name=DallasNews.Complex/> In an interview, Johnson's parents said that he was once extroverted and patriotic, and wanted to become a police officer.

===Before the shooting===
According to an employment application made by Johnson seven months before his death, he worked in a [[Jimmy John's]] sandwich shop in north Dallas beginning in 2010, and took a position as a [[quality assurance]] worker at a [[Garland, Texas]] truck plant in 2012.<ref name=NBC.Loner/> At the time of his death, Johnson was working as an in-home caregiver for his mentally disabled adult brother.

Johnson had no criminal record in Texas.<ref name=NYTimes.Identified/> However, the [[Mesquite Police Department (Texas)|Mesquite Police Department]] documented an encounter with him in January 2011. According to the report, Johnson walked into their police station "visibly upset and...bouncing from side to side." He told an officer that a female friend had lied to him and that he had nowhere else to go. He also declined mental health treatment and claimed he was not a threat to himself or others. Johnson was eventually picked up from the station by a friend from his [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] unit.<ref name=WSJ.Points/>

The [[Veterans Health Administration]] released documents in August 2016 showing that Johnson had symptoms for [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) following his return from Afghanistan. He was not formally diagnosed with the condition, and doctors concluded that he presented no serious risk to himself or others. Johnson had sought treatment for anxiety, depression, and hallucinations, once telling doctors that he had experienced nightmares after witnessing fellow soldiers dying in explosions. Johnson also said that he would hear voices and mortars exploding; and that after returning to the U.S., he would be paranoid, suffer from lower back pain, and experience panic attacks a few times per week. For the latter condition, he recalled one incident at a [[Wal-Mart]] that required a police response. For his conditions, Johnson was prescribed several medications, including a muscle relaxant, an antidepressant, and anti-anxiety and sleep medication.<ref name=Yahoo.PTSD/>

Chief Brown said that while Johnson had been planning the shooting before the deaths of Sterling and Philando Castile, both incidents served as the trigger to commit the shooting and that he saw the Dallas protest as "an opportunity" to attack police officers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/07/10/micah-johnson-dallas-shooting/|title=Dallas Police Chief: Micah Johnson Planned To Target Police Before Fatal Shootings Of 2 Black Men|publisher=CBS New York|agency=Associated Press|date=July 10, 2016|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref> Johnson had offered to work security at an anti-[[Donald Trump]] rally led by Dallas civil rights activist Reverend Peter Johnson on June 16, but he insisted on bringing a gun, so the reverend declined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://keranews.org/post/dallas-shooting-suspect-wanted-bring-gun-trump-protest-rally-civil-rights-leader-says|title=Dallas Shooting Suspect Wanted To Bring Gun To Trump Protest Rally, Civil Rights Leader Says|first=Bill|last=Zeeble|publisher=KERA|date=July 10, 2016|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref>

=== Police High commands ===
Due to the criticism against [[Militarization of police]], [[Dallas Police Department]]'s High command ordered the officers assigned to the protest to not wear [[Bulletproof vest|military-styled bulletproof vest]] (Such as plate carriers) because they didn't want the officers to look too "militaristic, aggressive" and instead ordered to wear standard issue kevlar vests, which weren't able to protect from rifle rounds Johnson had. For the same reasons, officers weren't able to arm with long guns, such as [[AR-15 style rifle|AR-15]]. President of Dallas Police Association, Mike Mata stated that most of the wounds of the killed officers were [[Gunshot wound|gunshot wounds]] to the [[Thorax|chest]], [[Abdomen|lower abdomen]], which the plate carriers could've covered them.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-06-29|title=Police Told To Leave Protective Gear Behind|url=https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2017/06/29/police-told-to-leave-protective-gear-behind/|access-date=2020-08-07|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Army internal review===
On July 13, [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] officials announced that the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] has launched an internal review into Johnson's military service. The review was initiated after questions were raised about the appropriateness of his honorable discharge despite the sexual harassment allegations made against him, and the fact that the Army had been highly considering an "other than honorable discharge" for Johnson.<ref name=DallasNews.Review/><ref name=CBS.Investigates/>

During the investigation, the Army uncovered an incomplete amount of information regarding the sexual harassment allegations. The following day, another review was initiated by the Army's [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Criminal Investigation Command]], to determine if a full investigation was made into the allegations. An Army official echoed a statement made by the lawyer who represented Johnson, saying that Johnson's honorable discharge may have been the result of an administrative error. The same official added that nothing had been found in Johnson's record that indicated a willingness to commit murder.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/14/politics/dallas-shooter-military-record/|title=Army reviews military record of Dallas police shooter Micah Johnson|work=CNN Politics|date=July 14, 2016|accessdate=July 14, 2016|first=Barbara|last=Starr}}</ref>

Chief Brown said that police efforts to identify the gunman were made more difficult by the presence of up to thirty civilians [[Open carry in the United States|openly carrying]] rifles during the protest, which is legal in Texas. Brown said, "We're trying as best we can as a law enforcement community to make it work so that citizens can express their [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rights. But it's increasingly challenging when people have [[AR-15]]s slung over their shoulder and they're in a crowd. We don't know who the good guy is versus the bad guy when everyone starts shooting." In an interview after the shooting, Dallas Mayor [[Mike Rawlings]] said that he supported changing [[Gun laws in Texas|state law]] to restrict the public carrying of rifles and [[shotgun]]s so that the police could distinguish between suspects and civilians more easily during crises.<ref name="Hennessy-FiskeOpenCarry">{{cite web|first=Molly|last=Hennessy-Fiske|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-dallas-chief-20160711-snap-story.html|title=Dallas police chief: Open carry makes things confusing during mass shootings|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=July 11, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}</ref><ref name="FernandezBlinderMontgomery">{{cite news|first1=Manny|last1=Fernandez |first2=Alan |last2=Blinder|first3=David|last3=Montgomery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/us/texas-open-carry-laws-blurred-lines-between-suspects-and-marchers.html|title=Texas Open-Carry Laws Blurred Lines Between Suspects and Marchers|work=The New York Times|date=July 10, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}</ref>

''[[Dallas Observer]]'' noted several similarities between Johnson and [[Mark Essex]], a discharged [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] sailor and [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] who committed two attacks against white civilians and police officers on December 31, 1972, and January 7, 1973, in [[New Orleans]].

===Lawsuits===
In November 2016, Enrique Zamarripa, the father of Officer Patrick Zamarripa, one of the murdered police officers, filed a lawsuit against [[Black Lives Matter]] and 13 other defendants, including the [[Nation of Islam]], the [[New Black Panther Party]], the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]], and individual activists. The lawsuit seeks $550 million in damages and claims that Johnson was acting as an agent for the defendants and alleged that the defendants incited violence and caused the Dallas shooting as a "direct result".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2016/11/07/father-of-officer-killed-in-downtown-dallas-ambush-sues-black-lives-matter/|title=Father Of Officer Killed In Downtown Dallas Ambush Sues Black Lives Matter|work=CBS DFW|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=November 7, 2016}}</ref><ref name="CardonaLawsuit">{{cite web|first=Claire Z.|last=Cardona|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/news/dallas-police/2016/11/08/mother-slain-dallas-officer-distances-lawsuit-black-lives-matter|title=Mother of slain Dallas officer distances herself from lawsuit against Black Lives Matter|publisher=Dallas Morning News|date=November 8, 2016|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}</ref> The mother of the officer, Valerie Zamarripa, distanced herself from her ex-husband's lawsuit, saying that it did not reflect her views, or the views of the foundation set up in her son's name.<ref name="CardonaLawsuit"/>

===Effects on policing===
As a result of the shooting, local law enforcement officers worked more than $800,000 in overtime to help the [[Dallas Police Department]] (DPD). This included $86,000 spent by the Dallas County Sheriff's Office, $88,000 spent by the Arlington Police Department, about $705,250 by DPD, and unknown sums by the Irving Police Department and the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20160831-july-7-ambush-cost-dallas-area-law-enforcement-more-than-800000-in-overtime.ece |title=July 7 ambush cost Dallas-area law enforcement more than $800,000 in overtime|work=The Dallas Morning News|date=August 31, 2016 |accessdate=September 9, 2016|first=Naheed|last=Rajwani}}</ref>

Following this shooting and [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|another in Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], that killed three police officers and wounded three others, local law enforcement agencies across the U.S. began readjusting response strategies, with more officers being paired up in patrol vehicles.{{efn|While it was once standard practice to pair officers in patrol vehicles, budget cuts and other staffing demands prompted many police departments to implement more single-officer patrols.<ref name=Time.Responding/>}} Departments also began to increase security and surveillance at protest events against police.<ref name=Time.Responding>{{cite news |url=http://time.com/4411617/police-change-tactics-baton-rouge-shooting/|title=How America's Police Are Responding to Baton Rouge and Dallas |work=Time|date=July 18, 2016|accessdate=July 19, 2016|first=Josh|last=Sanburn}}</ref>

Within twelve days following the shooting, DPD received 467 job applications, representing a 344% increase from the 136 applications received by the department in June. In the months before the shooting, DPD, along with other police departments across the country, had been struggling to recruit new officers. DPD even had to cancel academy classes because there were not enough applicants, and also struggled in retaining officers due to a low salary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-dallas-idUSKCN10304X |title=Dallas police job applications surge after fatal ambush attacks|work=Reuters|date=July 22, 2016|accessdate=July 24, 2016|first=Lisa Maria|last=Garza}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://keranews.org/post/after-deadly-shootings-dallas-police-recruits-say-theyre-more-committed-ever|title=After Deadly Shootings, Dallas Police Recruits Say They're More Committed Than Ever|work=KERA News|date=August 3, 2016 |accessdate=August 3, 2016|first=Christopher|last=Connelly}}</ref> On August 25, DPD announced their goal to hire 549 officers by October 2017, though some police and City Council officials called it an unrealistic goal due to the department's strict hiring requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20160825-dallas-wants-549-new-cops-but-that-may-not-be-realistic.ece |title=Dallas wants 549 new cops, but that may not be realistic|work=The Dallas Morning News|date=August 25, 2016 |accessdate=September 9, 2016|first1=Naheed|last1=Rajwani|first2=Tasha|last2=Tsiaperas}}</ref>

To this effect, Stoughton said, "I'm not aware of any police department having on hand something that is intended to be used as a weaponized explosive."
