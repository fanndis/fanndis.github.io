'''Hulu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|uː|l|uː}}) is an American [[subscription video on demand]] service fully controlled and majority-owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], with [[NBCUniversal]] (owned by [[Comcast]]) as an [[Equity (finance)|equity]] stakeholder.

The service was initially established as a [[joint venture]] between [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] and NBC Universal, [[Providence Equity Partners]], and later [[The Walt Disney Company]], serving as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from their respective [[television network]]s. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initially [[brand]]ed as ''Hulu Plus'', which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and [[broadcast delay|undelayed]] access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched ''Hulu with Live TV''—an [[Over-the-top media services|over-the-top]] [[IPTV]] service featuring [[linear television]] channels. Time Warner (now [[WarnerMedia]]) later held a stake in the service. As of the third quarter of 2020, Hulu had 36.6 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/disney-plus-blows-out-expectations-in-its-first-year-with-73point7-million-subscribers.html|website=[[CNBC]]|date=November 12, 2020|accessdate=November 14, 2020}}</ref>

In March 2019, Disney [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquired]] [[21st Century Fox]], giving it a 60% [[controlling interest|majority stake]] in Hulu. [[AT&T]] (which acquired Time Warner in 2018) sold back its roughly 10% stake the following month. Comcast, the only other shareholder, announced on May 14, 2019, that it had agreed to cede its control to Disney, and reached an agreement for Disney to purchase its 33% stake in the company as early as 2024.<ref name="DisneyIstakingfullcontrolofHulu">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/media/disney-buys-comcast-hulu-ownership/index.html|title=Disney is taking full control of Hulu|work=CNN|date=May 14, 2019|accessdate=July 24, 2019|last=Jarvey|first=Natalie|archive-date=July 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724181631/https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/media/disney-buys-comcast-hulu-ownership/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Under the agreement, Comcast's 33% stake can be sold to Disney at [[fair market value]] as early as 2024. The fair market value will be determined at that time, but Disney guaranteed a minimum valuation of the entire company at $27.5 billion (valuing the Comcast stake as worth at least $5.8 billion).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/what-expect-hulu-under-disneys-control-1212776|title="Older, Broader, Edgier": What to Expect From Hulu Under Disney's Control|last=Jarvey|first=Natalie|date=May 22, 2019|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=June 23, 2019|archive-date=June 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606023412/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/what-expect-hulu-under-disneys-control-1212776|url-status=live}}</ref> Randy Freer would report to Disney executive [[Kevin A.

Viewership numbers for the site are tracked by measurement firms such as [[ComScore]], [[Nielsen ratings]], and [[Quantcast]]. In partnership with comScore, Hulu is the first digital company to receive multi-platform measurement at an individual level that includes co-viewing for living room devices.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The reliability of these metrics has been drawn into question, partly due to widely divergent estimates.

I think it’s important to look at the differences at how we plan to enter the market. Hulu aggregates third party content; this will not...Hulu has no brand awareness outside of the US.

During an earnings call on August 5, 2020, [[Bob Chapek]], who had taken over from Iger as CEO of Disney in late February, announced that a new streaming service, will launch internationally in 2021. He asserted that the Hulu brand is unknown outside the U.S., and therefore Disney had decided against using it for the new service. Chapek further announced that the new streaming service will not have licensed content from other studios, similarly to Disney+ and unlike Hulu which does carry licensed content. Instead, the international service will only have content owned by Disney from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[FX (TV channel)|FX]], [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], [[20th Television]], [[20th Century Studios]] and [[Searchlight Pictures]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=August 4, 2020|title=Disney is launching a new Star-branded streaming service internationally|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354712/disney-star-streaming-service-international-expansion-hulu-plus-abc-fx-fox|access-date=August 5, 2020|website=The Verge|language=en|archive-date=August 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805125023/https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354712/disney-star-streaming-service-international-expansion-hulu-plus-abc-fx-fox|url-status=live}}</ref>
