==Background==

=== Bolivarian Revolution ===
{{Main|Bolivarian Revolution|Economic policy of the Hugo Chávez government}}

Venezuela was headed by a series of right-wing governments for years. In 1992, [[Hugo Chávez]] formed a group named [[Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200]] aiming to take over the government, and [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts|attempted a coup d'état]].<ref name="Guillermoprieto_2005">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Guillermoprieto|2005}}{{Citation not found}}</ref><ref name="Uppsala">[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, Venezuela, War and Minor Conflict, In depth, Hugo Chávez and the 1992 coup attempt, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=167&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#</ref> Later, another coup was performed while Chávez was in prison. Both coup attempts failed and fighting resulted in around 143–300 deaths.<ref name="Uppsala"/> Chávez, after receiving a pardon from president Rafael Caldera, later decided to participate in elections and formed the [[Movement for the Fifth Republic]] (MVR) party. He won the [[1998 Venezuelan presidential election]]s. The changes started by Chávez were named the [[Bolivarian Revolution]].
[[File:Operemm-2.jpg|upright|thumbnail|left|250px|Late President [[Hugo Chávez]] in 2010.]]
Chávez, an [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] politician who declared himself a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]], enacted a series of social reforms aimed at improving quality of life. According to the [[World Bank]], Chávez's social measures reduced [[poverty]] from about 49% in 1998 to about 25%. From 1999 to 2012, the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)]], shows that Venezuela achieved the second highest rate of poverty reduction in the region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Social Panorama of Latin America 2013|url=http://www.eclac.org/cgi-bin/getProd.asp?xml=/publicaciones/xml/8/51768/P51768.xml&xsl=/tpl-i/p9f.xsl&base=/tpl-i/top-bottom.xslt|publisher=[[ECLAC]]|accessdate=24 April 2014|date=March 2014}}</ref> The World Bank also explained that Venezuela's economy is "extremely vulnerable" to changes in oil prices since in 2012 "96% of the country’s exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue" relied on oil production.

On 5 March 2013, Chávez died of [[cancer]] and [[Nicolás Maduro]], who was vice president at the time, took Chávez's place.<ref>{{cite news|title=Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez dies|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/05/world/americas/venezuela-chavez-main/|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=CNN}}</ref> Throughout the year 2013 and into the year 2014, worries about the troubled economy, increasing crime and corruption increased, which led to the start of anti-government protests.

=== First demonstrations of 2014 ===
[[File:PROTEST REASONS sign.jpg|upright=1.1364|thumbnail|right|Protesters sign saying, "Why do I protest? Insecurity, scarcity, injustices, repression, deceit. For my future."]]

Demonstrations against violence in Venezuela began in January 2014,<ref name=MostDangerous/> and continued, when former presidential candidate [[Henrique Capriles]] shook the hand of President Maduro;<ref name=WhatTheHeck/> this "gesture... cost him support and helped propel" opposition leader [[Leopoldo López Mendoza]] to the forefront.<ref name= WhatTheHeck /> According to the Associated Press, well before protests began in the Venezuelan capital city of Caracas, the attempted rape of a young student on a university campus in [[San Cristóbal, Táchira|San Cristóbal]], in the western border state of [[Táchira]], led to protests from students "outraged" at "long-standing complaints about deteriorating security under President Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor, the late [[Hugo Chávez]]. But what really set them off was the harsh police response to their initial protest, in which several students were detained and allegedly abused, as well as follow-up demonstrations to call for their release". These protests expanded, attracted non-students, and led to more detentions; eventually, other students joined, and the protests spread to Caracas and other cities, with opposition leaders getting involved.<ref name= AttemptedRape>{{cite news |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0222/Did-attempted-rape-ignite-Venezuela-s-national-protests |title= Did attempted rape ignite Venezuela's national protests? |author= Sequera, Vivia |newspaper= The Christian Science Monitor |agency= Associated Press |date= 22 February 2014 |accessdate= 24 February 2014}}</ref>

Corruption in Venezuela is ranked high by [[Corruption Perceptions Index|world standards]]. Corruption is difficult to measure reliably, but one well-known measure is the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], produced annually by a Berlin-based NGO, [[Transparency International]] (TNI). Venezuela has been one of the most corrupt countries in TNI surveys since they started in 1995, ranking 38th out of 41 that year<ref>''[[Transparency International]]'', 15 July 1995, [http://www.transparency.org/content/download/2915/18031/file/cpi1995.pdf 1995 TI Corruption Index]</ref> and performing very poorly in subsequent years.

[[World Justice Project|The World Justice Project]] moreover, ranked Venezuela's government in 99th place worldwide and gave it the worst ranking of any country in Latin America in the 2014 Rule of Law Index.<ref name=WJPIndex>{{cite news|title=WJP 2014 Rule of Law Index|url=http://data.worldjusticeproject.org/#/index/VEN|website=World Justice Project|date=5 March 2014}}</ref> The report says, "Venezuela is the country with the poorest performance of all countries analyzed, showing decreasing trends in the performance of many areas in relation to last year. The country ranks last in the surrender of accounts by the government due to an increasing concentration of executive power and a weakened checks and balances." The report further states that "administrative bodies suffer inefficiencies and lack of transparency…and the judicial system, although relatively accessible, lost positions due to increasing political interference. Another area of concern is the increase in crime and violence, and violations of fundamental rights, particularly the right to freedom of opinion and expression."<ref name="WJPcorruption"/>

In a tweet, Ameliach asked UBCh to launch a rapid counterattack against protesters saying, "Gringos (Americans) and fascists beware" and that the order would come from the President of the National Assembly, [[Diosdado Cabello]].<ref name=HRWpfp/><ref>{{cite news|title= Ameliach prohíbe marchas en los barrios de Valencia| trans-title = Ameliach forbids marches in Valencia neighbourhoods | language = es| url=http://www.elmundo.com.ve/noticias/actualidad/noticias/ameliach-prohibe-marchas-en-los-barrios-de-valenci.aspx |accessdate=18 February 2014|newspaper= El Mundo}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| language = es| title = La foto que Ameliach no quiere que veas: Génesis Carmona herida | trans-title = The photogram Ameliach does not want you to see: Génesis Carmona injured | url= http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/02/18/la-foto-que-ameliach-no-quiere-que-veas-genesis-carmona-herida/ |accessdate= 19 February 2014| newspaper= La Patilla|date= 18 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Ameliach advierte que Cabello dará orden para "contraataque fulminante"| trans-title = Ameliach adverts Cabello will order "fulminating counter attack" | url = http://www.venezuelaaldia.com/2014/02/ameliach-advierte-que-cabello-dara-orden-para-contraataque-fulminante/|accessdate=17 February 2014|newspaper=Venezuela Al Dia|date= 17 February 2014}}</ref>

===Government forces===

Government authorities have used "unlawful force against unarmed protesters and other people in the vicinity of demonstrations". Government agencies involved in the use of unlawful force include the National Guard, the National Police, the Guard of the People, and other government agencies. Some common abuses included "severely beating unarmed individuals, firing live ammunition, rubber bullets, and teargas canisters indiscriminately into crowds, and firing rubber bullets deliberately, at point-blank range, at unarmed individuals, including, in some cases, individuals already in custody". Human Rights Watch said that "Venezuelan security forces repeatedly resorted to force—including [[lethal force]]—in situations in which it was wholly unjustified" and that "the use of force occurred in the context of protests that were peaceful, according to victims, eyewitnesses, lawyers, and journalists, who in many instances shared video footage and photographs corroborating their accounts".<ref name=HRWpfp/>

''The New York Times'' reported that a protester was "shot at such close range by a soldier at a protest that his surgeon said he had to remove pieces of the plastic shotgun shell buried in his leg, along with the shards of keys" that were in their pocket at the time. Venezuelan authorities have also been accused of shooting [[shotgun]]s with "hard plastic buckshot at point-blank range" which allegedly injured a great number of protesters and killed a woman. The woman who was killed was banging a pot outside of her house in protest when her father reported that "soldiers rode up on motorcycles" and that the woman then fell while trying to seek shelter in her home. Witnesses of the incident then said that "a soldier got off his motorcycle, pointed his shotgun at her head and fired". The shot that was fired by the policeman "slammed through her eye socket into her [[brain]]". The woman died days before her birthday. Her father said that the soldier who killed her was not arrested.<ref name=NYscars>{{cite news|last=Neuman|first=William|title=In Venezuela, Protesters Point to Their Scars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/world/americas/in-venezuela-protesters-point-to-their-scars.html?_r=0|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 April 2014}}</ref> There has also been claims by the Venezuelan Penal Forum accusing authorities that have allegedly attempted to tamper with evidence, covering up that they had shot students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/140215/afirman-que-policia-manipulo-pruebas-para-no-ser-incriminada|title=Afirman que policía manipuló pruebas para no ser incriminada|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>

====Use of chemical agents====

Some mysterious chemical agents were used in Venezuela as well. On 20 March 2014, the appearance of "red gas" first occurred when it was used in San Cristóbal against protesters, with reports that it was [[CN gas]].<ref>{{cite news|title=¿Comienzan a lanzar gas lacrimógeno cocarcinógeno?

In April 2014, Amnesty International worried about "the use of chemical toxins in high concentrations” by government forces and recommended better training for them.<ref name=AIabuses/>

A study by [[Mónica Kräuter]], a chemist and professor, involved the collection of thousands of tear gas canisters fired by Venezuelan authorities in 2014. She stated that the majority of canisters used the main component [[CS gas]], supplied by Cóndor of Brazil, which meets Geneva Convention requirements. However, 72% of the tear gas used was expired and other canisters produced in Venezuela by Cavim did not show adequate labels or expiration dates. Following the expiration of tear gas, Krauter notes that it "breaks down into [[cyanide]] oxide, [[phosgene]]s and [[nitrogen]]s that are extremely dangerous".<ref>{{cite news|title=Bombas lacrimógenas que usa el gobierno están vencidas y emanan cianuro (+ recomendaciones)|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2017/04/08/bombas-lacrimogenas-que-usa-el-gobierno-estan-vencidas-y-emanan-cianuro-recomendaciones/|accessdate=9 April 2017|work=[[La Patilla]]|date=8 April 2017|language=es-ES}}</ref>

In 2017, Amnesty International once again criticized the Bolivarian government's usage of chemical agents, expressing concern of a "red gas" used to suppress protesters in Chacao on 8 April 2017, demanding "clarification of the components of the red tear gas used by state security forces against the opposition demonstrations".<ref>{{cite news|title=Amnistía Internacional instó a aclarar componentes del gas rojo|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/protestas/amnistia-internacional-insto-aclarar-componentes-del-gas-rojo_96071|accessdate=9 April 2017|work=[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]|date=8 April 2017|language=es}}</ref> Experts stated that all tear gas used by authorities should originally be colorless, noting that the color may be added to provoke or "color" protesters so they can easily be identified and arrested.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Salazar|first1=Abraham|title=Expertos explican el humo rojo y cómo defenderse de las bombas lacrimógenas|url=http://efectococuyo.com/principales/expertos-explican-el-humo-rojo-y-como-defenderse-de-las-bombas-lacrimogenas|accessdate=9 April 2017|work=[[Efecto Cocuyo]]|date=9 April 2017|language=es-ES}}</ref> On 10 April 2017, Venezuelan police fired tear gas at protesters from helicopters flying overhead, resulting with demonstrators running from projectiles to avoid being hit by the canisters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lanzan bombas lacrimógenas desde helicópteros en Chacaíto|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/protestas/lanzan-bombas-lacrimogenas-desde-helicopteros-chacaito_113767|accessdate=11 April 2017|agency=El Nacional|date=11 April 2017}}</ref>

====Abuse of protesters and detainees====
[[File:Venezuela National Guard Headlock.jpg|upright=1.1364|thumbnail|right|[[Venezuelan National Guard]]sman holding a protester in a [[Grappling hold#Other|headlock]].]]
According to Amnesty International, "torture is commonplace" against protesters by Venezuelan authorities despite Article 46 of the Venezuelan Constitution prohibiting "punishment, torture or cruel, [[inhuman or degrading treatment]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Amnistía: tortura es habitual en Venezuela|url=http://www.voanoticias.com/content/venezuela_tortura/1913227.html|publisher=Voz de America|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> During the protests, there were hundreds of reported cases of torture.<ref>{{cite news|title=Estudiantes piden a la ONU una misión de investigación|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/protestas-en-venezuela/140618/estudiantes-piden-a-la-onu-una-mision-de-investigacion|accessdate=20 June 2014|agency=El Universal|date=18 June 2014}}</ref> In a report titled ''Punished for Protesting'' following a March investigation of conduct during the protests, [[Human Rights Watch]] said that those who were detained by government authorities were subjected to "severe physical abuse" with some abuses including being beaten "with fists, helmets, and firearms; electric shocks or burns; being forced to [[Squatting position|squat]] or [[kneel]], without moving, for hours at a time; being handcuffed to other detainees, sometimes in pairs and others in human chains of dozens of people, for hours at a time; and extended periods of extreme cold or heat." It was also reported that "many victims and family members we spoke with said they believed they might face reprisals if they reported abuses by police, guardsmen, or armed pro-government gangs".<ref name=HRWpfp/>

Amnesty International "received reports from detainees who were forced to spend hours on their knees or feet in detention centers". Amnesty International also reported that a student was forced at gunpoint by plainclothes officers to sign a confession to acts he did not commit where his mother explained that “They told him that they would kill him if he didn’t sign it, ... He started to cry, but he wouldn’t sign it. They then wrapped him in foam sheets and started to hit him with rods and a fire extinguisher. Later, they doused him with gasoline, stating that they would then have evidence to charge him.” Amnesty International said that the Human Rights Center at the Andres Bello Catholic University had reported that, “There are two cases that involved electric shocks, two cases that involved pepper gas and another two cases where they were doused with gasoline,” she said. “We’ve found there to be systematic conduct on the part of the state to inflict inhumane treatment on detainees because of similar reports from different days and detention centers.”<ref name=AIabuses>{{cite news|title=Amnesty Reports Dozens of Venezuela Torture Accounts|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-01/amnesty-reports-dozens-of-venezuela-torture-accounts.html|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg}}</ref>[[File:UN_-_Venezuela_Continued_impunity_amid_dismal_human_rights_situation.webm|alt=|left|thumb|270x270px|[[High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Zeid Raad Al Hussein]] and relatives of those killed during protests discuss the crisis in Venezuela]]''The New York Times'' reported that the Penal Forum said that abuses are "continuous and systematic" and that Venezuelan authorities were "widely accused of beating detainees, often severely, with many people saying the security forces then robbed them, stealing cellphones, money and jewelry". In one case, a group of men said that when they were leaving a protest since it turned violent, "soldiers surrounded the car, broke the windows and tossed a tear gas canister inside". A man then said that a soldier "fired a shotgun at him at close range" while in the vehicle. The men were then "pulled from the car and beaten viciously" then one soldier "smashed their hands with the butt of his shotgun, telling them it was punishment for protesters’ throwing rocks." The vehicle was then set on fire. One protester said that while detained, soldiers "kicked him over and over again." The protesters he was with "were handcuffed together, threatened with an attack dog, made to crouch for long periods, pepper sprayed and beaten." The protester then said that he was "hit so hard on the head with a soldier’s helmet that he heard it crack". A woman also said she was with her daughter when "they were swept up by National Guard soldiers, taken with six other women to a military post and handed over to female soldiers". The women then said that "soldiers beat them, kicked them and threatened to kill them". The women also said that soldiers threatened to rape them, cut their hair and "were released only after being made to sign a paper stating that they had not been mistreated."<ref name="NYscars" />

Human Rights Watch reported that a man was going home and was attacked by National Guardsman dispersing a group of protesters. He was then hit by rubber bullets the National Guardsmen shot, beat by the National Guardsmen, and then shot in the groin. Another man was detained, shot repeatedly with rubber bullets, beat with rifles and helmets by three National Guardsman and was asked "Who's your president?" Some individuals that were arrested innocently were beaten and forced to repeat that Nicolas Maduro was president.<ref name=HRWpfp/>

''[[NTN24]]'' reported from a lawyer that National Guardsmen and individuals with "Cuban accents" in [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]] forced three arrested adolescents to confess to crimes they did not commit and then the adolescents "kneeled and were forced to raise their arms then shot with buckshot throughout their body" during an alleged "[[target practice]]".<ref name="ntn24.com">{{cite news|title="Funcionarios jugaban con ellos al tiro al blanco": abogado que atendió a 3 adolescentes detenidos en Mérida|url=http://www.ntn24.com/videos/entrevista-genis-navarro-124481|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=NTN24|date=12 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718165056/http://www.ntn24.com/videos/entrevista-genis-navarro-124481|archive-date=18 July 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="venezuelaaldia.com">{{cite news|title=Denuncian que GNB y agentes cubanos habrían jugado tiro al blanco con adolescentes detenidos (+Video)|url=http://www.venezuelaaldia.com/2014/03/denuncian-que-gnb-y-agentes-cubanos-habrian-jugado-tiro-al-blanco-con-adolescentes-detenidos-video/|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=Venezuela Al Dia|date=14 March 2014}}</ref> ''NTN24'' reported that some protesters were tortured and raped by government forces who detained them during the protests.<ref name = testigos>{{cite news|title="Fuimos testigos de cómo algunos estudiantes fueron violados vía anal": abogado del Foro Penal Venezolano|trans-title="We witnessed some students were anally violated": Venezuelan legal forum lawyer|language=es|url=http://www.ntn24.com/videos/entrevista-abogado-ddhh-venezuela-121933|accessdate=22 February 2014|newspaper=NTN24|date=16 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228071250/http://www.ntn24.com/videos/entrevista-abogado-ddhh-venezuela-121933|archive-date=28 February 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''El Nuevo Herald'' reported that student protesters had been tortured by government forces in an attempt for the government to make them admit they are part of a plan of foreign individuals to overthrow the Venezuelan government.<ref name=ENHtorture>{{cite news|title=Torturan a estudiantes en Venezuela para vincularlos con Miami|url=http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2014/03/21/1706509/torturan-a-estudiantes-en-venezuela.html|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=El Nuevo Herald|date=21 March 2014}}</ref> In Valencia, protesters were dispersed by the National Guard in El Trigál where four students (three men and one woman) were attacked inside of a car while trying to leave the perimeter;<ref name="notitarde.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.notitarde.com/Valencia/2-vehiculos-incendiados-1-dama-herida-y-11-detenidos-tras-protestas-Fotos/2014/02/14/304498| title=Saldo de las protestas en El Trigal| newspaper=[[Notitarde]]| date=13 February 2014| access-date=11 April 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402160110/http://www.notitarde.com/Valencia/2-vehiculos-incendiados-1-dama-herida-y-11-detenidos-tras-protestas-Fotos/2014/02/14/304498| archive-date=2 April 2014| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> the three men were imprisoned and one of them reported being  sodomized by one of the officers with a rifle.<ref name="diariolasamericas.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.diariolasamericas.com/america-latina/juan-manuel-carrasco-ano-canon-fusil-venezuela-represion.html%7ctitle|title=Documento no encontrado|accessdate=7 March 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024912/http://www.diariolasamericas.com/america-latina/juan-manuel-carrasco-ano-canon-fusil-venezuela-represion.html%7Ctitle|archive-date=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In an ''El Nacional'' article sharing interviews with protesters who were arrested, individuals explained their experiences in jail. One protester explained how he was placed into a 3 by 2 meter cell with 30 other prisoners where the inmates had to defecate in a bag behind a single curtain. The protester continued explaining how prisoners dealt punishments toward one another and the punishment for "guarimberos" was to be tied and gagged, which would allegedly occur without intervention from the authorities. Other arrested protesters interviewed also explained their fears of being imprisoned with violent criminals.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Emilia Jorge |first1=Maria |title=La cárcel, según los jóvenes que protestaron |url=http://www.el-nacional.com/sociedad/carcel-jovenes-protestaron_0_455954474.html |accessdate=7 August 2014 |agency=El Nacional |date=3 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806150904/http://www.el-nacional.com/sociedad/carcel-jovenes-protestaron_0_455954474.html |archive-date=6 August 2014 }}</ref>

Human Rights Watch reported that, "not all of the security force members or justice officials encountered by the victims in these cases participated in the abusive practices. Indeed, in some of the cases ... security officials and doctors in public hospitals had surreptitiously intervened to help them or to ease their suffering". Some National Guardsman assisted detainees that were being held in "incommunicado". It was also reported that "[i]n several cases, doctors and nurses in public hospitals—and even those serving in military clinics—stood up to armed security forces, who wanted to deny medical care to seriously wounded detainees. They insisted detainees receive urgent medical care, in spite of direct threats—interventions that may have saved victims’ lives".<ref name=HRWpfp/>

=====Government's response to abuses=====
The Venezuelan Attorney General's office reported it was conducting, as of the Human Rights Watch report, 145 investigations into alleged human rights abuses, and that 17 security officials had been detained in connection to them. President Maduro and other government officials have acknowledged human rights abuses, but said they were isolated incidents and not part of a larger pattern.<ref name=HRWpfp/> When opposition parties asked for a debate about torture in the National Assembly, the Venezuelan government refused, blaming the violence on the opposition saying, "The violent are not us, the violent are in a group of opposition".<ref name=EUtorture>{{cite news|title=Bancada del PSUV en la AN niega debate sobre las torturas y tratos crueles|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/140513/bancada-del-psuv-en-la-an-niega-debate-sobre-las-torturas-y-tratos-cru|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=El Universal|date=13 May 2014}}</ref>

====Arbitrary arrests====
According to [[Human Rights Watch]], Venezuelan government authorities arrested many innocent people. They stated that "the government routinely failed to present credible evidence that these protesters were committing crimes at the time they were arrested, which is a requirement under Venezuelan law when detaining someone without an arrest warrant". They also explained that "Some of the people detained, moreover, were simply in the vicinity of protests but not participating in them. This group of detainees included people who were passing through areas where protests were taking place, or were in public places nearby. Others were detained on private property such as apartment buildings. In every case in which individuals were detained on private property, security forces entered buildings without search orders, often forcing their way in by breaking down doors." One man was in his apartment when government forces fired tear gas into the building. The man went to the courtyard for fresh air and was arrested for no reason after police broke into the apartments.<ref name=HRWpfp/>

=== Violent protests ===
[[File:Protesta en Caracas, 10May14c.jpg|upright=1.1364|thumbnail|Some protests have included incidents of arson, vandalism and other cases of violence.]]
Apart from peaceful demonstrations, an element in some protests includes burning trash, creating barricades and have resulted in violent clashes between the opposition and state authorities. Human Rights Watch said that protesters "who committed acts of violence at protests were a very small minority—usually less than a dozen people out of scores or hundreds of people present". It was reported that barricades were the most common form of protest and that occasional attacks on authorities with Molotov cocktails, rocks and slingshots occurred. In rare instances, homemade mortars were used by protesters. The use of Molotov Cocktails in some cases caught authorities and some government vehicles on fire.<ref name=HRWpfp/> President Maduro has stated that some protests "have included arson attacks on government buildings, universities and bus stations."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/08/venezuela-protests-sign-us-wants-oil-says-nicolas-maduro|title=Venezuela protests are sign that US wants our oil, says Nicolás Maduro|author=Seumas Milne|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>

==== Barricades ====
Throughout the protests, a common tactic that has divided opinions among Venezuelans and the anti-government opposition has been erecting burning street barricades, colloquially known as ''guarimbas''. Street barricades, which stop vehicles from passing, violate the 50th article of the constitution of Venezuela, which grants the right of free transit.<ref>[[s:Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela/Title 3#16]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsj.gov.ve/legislacion/constitucion1999.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417173551/http://www.tsj.gov.ve/legislacion/constitucion1999.htm |archive-date=17 April 2014 }}</ref> Initially, these barricades consisted of piles of trash and cardboard set on fire at night, and were easily removed by Venezuelan security forces. ''Guarimbas'' have since evolved into "fortress-like structures" of bricks, mattresses, wooden planks and barbed wire guarded by protesters, who "have to resort to guerrilla-style tactics to get a response from the government of President Nicolas Maduro". However, their use is controversial. Critics claim ''guarimbas'', which are primarily erected in residential areas, victimize local residents and businesses and have little political impact.<ref name=BBCStreetblockades>{{cite web|title=Street blockades divide opinion in Venezuela|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26366809|publisher=BBC.com|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref>

President Maduro and poor sectors in some cities criticized barricades, with Maduro denouncing that “thousands of people are affected by a small group of ten or twenty persons”, and that “some of them don’t have access to health care, including children and elders”,<ref>"A la pregunta sobre si la motivación de las guarimbas es “protestar por unos problemas”, o sacar a Maduro del poder, 36,9% cree que lo hacen como protesta, pero 63,1% dijo que tienen como objetivo sacar del poder a Maduro.

In March 2014, the Venezuelan government suggested that the protesters wanted to repeat the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/venezuela-riots-kill-students-827/ |title=Venezuela coup?

President Maduro has said: "Beginning February 12, we have entered a new period in which the extreme right, unable to win democratically, seeks to win by fear, violence, subterfuge and [[media manipulation]]. They are more confident because the US government has always supported them despite their violence."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://afgj.org/alliance-for-global-justice-statement-on-right-wing-violence-in-venezuela | title = Statement on Right-Wing Violence in Venezuela | publisher = Alliance for Global Justice | accessdate = 21 February 2014}}</ref> In an op-ed in ''The New York Times'', President Maduro said that the protesters actions had caused several millions of dollars' worth of damage to public property. He continued, saying that the protesters have an undemocratic agenda to overthrow a democratically elected government, and that they are supported by the wealthy while receiving no support from the poor. He also added that crimes by government supporters will never be tolerated and that all perpetrators, no matter who they support, will be held accountable for their actions, and that the government has opened a Human Rights Council to investigate any issues, as "every victim deserves justice".<ref name= NYTmaduro/> In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', President Maduro pointed to the United States' [[Covert United States foreign regime change actions|history of backing coups]], citing examples such as the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]], [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]], and [[2004 Haitian coup d'état]].<ref name=Milne/> President Maduro also highlighted whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]]'s revelations, U.S. state department documents, and 2006 [[WikiLeaks]] cables from the U.S.'s ambassador to Venezuela outlining plans to "'divide', 'isolate' and 'penetrate' the Chávez government" and revealing opposition group funding, some through [[USAid]] and the [[Office of Transition Initiatives]], including $5 million earmarked for overt support of opposition political groups in 2014.<ref name=Milne/> The [[United States]] has denied all involvement in the Venezuelan protests with President [[Barack Obama]] saying, "Rather than trying to distract from protests by making false accusations against U.S. diplomats, Venezuela's government should address the people's legitimate grievances".<ref name="huffingtonpost.com">{{cite news|title=Obama Condemns Violence in Ukraine And Venezuela |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/19/obama-ukraine-venezuela_n_4820189.html |accessdate=20 February 2014 |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=19 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220100823/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/19/obama-ukraine-venezuela_n_4820189.html |archive-date=20 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title = White House: US not backing Venezuela opposition protests | url = http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/17/venezuela-expels3usdiplomatsamidprotestviolence.html |accessdate=18 February 2014|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=18 February 2014}}</ref>

''The New York Times'' editorial board stated that such fears of a coup by President Maduro "appear to be a diversion strategy by a maniacal statesman who is unable to deal with the dismal state of his country’s economy and the rapidly deteriorating quality of life despite having the world’s largest oil reserves".<ref>{{cite news|title=Conspiracy Claims in Venezuela|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/opinion/conspiracy-claims-in-venezuela.html?_r=0|accessdate=1 March 2015|agency=[[The New York Times]]|date=25 February 2015}}</ref> The allegations made by the government were called by David Smilde of the [[Washington Office on Latin America]] as a form of unity, with Smilde saying, "When you talk about conspiracies, it's basically a way of rallying the troops.

In an op-ed for ''The New York Times'' titled “Venezuela’s Failing State," Lopez lamented “from the Ramo Verde military prison outside Caracas" that for the past fifteen years, “the definition of ‘intolerable’ in this country has declined by degrees until, to our dismay, we found ourselves with one of the highest murder rates in the Western Hemisphere, a 57 percent inflation rate and a scarcity of basic goods unprecedented outside of wartime.” The economic devastation, he added, “is matched by an equally oppressive political climate. Since student protests began on Feb. 4, more than 1,500 protesters have been detained, more than 30 have been killed, and more than 50 people have reported that they were tortured while in police custody,” thus exposing “the depth of this government's criminalization of dissent.”
Addressing his incarceration, López recounted that on 12 February, he had “urged Venezuelans to exercise their legal rights to protest and free speech – but to do so peacefully and without violence. Three people were shot and killed that day. An analysis of video by the news organization Últimas Noticias determined that shots were fired from the direction of plainclothes military troops.” Yet after the protest, “President Nicolás Maduro personally ordered my arrest on charges of murder, arson and terrorism…. To this day, no evidence of any kind has been presented.”<ref name= NYTlopez/>

The student leader at [[University of the Andes (Venezuela)|University of the Andes]] marched with protesters and delivered a document to the Cuban Embassy saying, "Let's go to the Cuban Embassy to ask them to stop Cuban interference in Venezuela. We know for a fact that Cubans are in the barracks' and [[Miraflores Palace|Miraflores]] giving instructions to suppress the people."<ref>{{cite news|title=Estudiantes llegaron a la embajada de Cuba|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/protestas-en-venezuela/140225/estudiantes-llegaron-a-la-embajada-de-cuba|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=El Universal|date=25 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Estudiantes marcharon hasta la embajada de Cuba (Fotos y Video)|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/02/25/estudiantes-seguiran-en-las-calles-2/|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=La Patilla|date=25 February 2014}}</ref>

The opposition demonstrations that followed have been called by some as "Middle Class Protests".<ref>{{cite news|title=Venezuela: These Are Middle Class Protests, And The Poor Aren't Joining|url=http://www.wftv.com/videos/news/venezuela-these-are-middle-class-protests-and-the/vCRR73/|accessdate=19 March 2014|newspaper=WFTV|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320012331/http://www.wftv.com/videos/news/venezuela-these-are-middle-class-protests-and-the/vCRR73/|archive-date=20 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, some lower class Venezuelans told student protesters visiting them that they also want to protest against the "worsening food shortages, crippling inflation and unchecked violent crime" but are afraid to since pro-government groups known as "colectivos" had "violently suppressed" demonstrations and had allegedly killed some opposition protesters too.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bajak |first=Frank |title=Venezuelan student protesters seek to woo poor |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/venezuelan-student-protesters-seek-woo-poor |accessdate=19 March 2014 |newspaper=Associated Press |date=19 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319231639/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/venezuelan-student-protesters-seek-woo-poor |archive-date=19 March 2014 }}</ref>

==Public opinion==

===Public support of protests===
Since the outset of the protests, peaceful daytime demonstrations advocating for policy changes and "redress of misgovernment" have received widespread support among the public.<ref name=Toro>{{cite magazine|last1=Toro|first1=Francisco|title=The Venezuelan Protests Are Playing Right Into the Regime's Hands|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/116957/venezuela-protests-strengthen-nicolas-maduro-government|magazine=[[The New Republic]]|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref> However, calls for regime change have been met with minimal backing while opposition leaders have struggled to win over politically-unaffiliated Venezuelans and members of the lower classes.

====Support by the poor====

The majority of protests were originally limited to more affluent areas of major cities with many working-class citizens thinking that the protests were unrepresentative of them and not working in their interests.<ref name=Toro/> This was especially evident in the capital Caracas, where in the wealthier east side of the city, protests widely disrupted daily activities, while life in the poorer west side of the city—hit especially hard by the country's economic struggles— largely continued as normal.<ref name=Kurmanaev/> ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes this "split personality" as representative of a long-standing class divide within the country and a potentially crippling fault within the anti-government movement, recognized both by opposition leaders and President Maduro.<ref name=Neuman1>{{cite news|last1=Neuman|first1=William|title=Slum Dwellers in Caracas Ask, What Protests?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/01/world/americas/slum-dwellers-in-caracas-ask-what-protests.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref> Later in the protests, however, many in Venezuela's slums that are seen as "bulwarks of [government] support" thanks to social welfare programs, supported the protesters due to frustrations over crime, shortages, and inflation<ref name=Bajak>{{cite news|last1=Bajak |first1=Frank |title=Venezuelan student protesters seek to woo poor |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/venezuelan-student-protesters-seek-woo-poor |work=Associated Press |accessdate=5 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504140447/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/venezuelan-student-protesters-seek-woo-poor |archive-date= 4 May 2014 }}</ref> and increasingly began to protest and loot as the situation in Venezuela continuously deteriorated.<ref name="GUARD16may2016"/>

In some poor neighborhoods like Petare in western Caracas, residents that had benefitted from such government programs, joined protests against inflation, high murder rates and shortages.<ref>{{cite news|last1=López|first1=Virginia|last2=Watts|first2=Jonathan|title=Venezuela's poor join protests as turmoil grips Chávez's revolution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/20/venezuelas-poor-protests-chavez-revolution|accessdate=16 July 2014|agency=The Guardian|date=20 February 2014}}</ref> Demonstrations in some poor communities remain rare, partially out of fear of armed ''colectivos'' acting as community enforcers and distrust of opposition leaders. An [[Associated Press]] investigation that followed two students encouraging anti-government support in poor districts found much discontent among the lower classes, but those Venezuelans were generally more worried about possibly losing pensions, subsidies, education, and healthcare if the opposition were to gain power, and many stated they felt leaders on both sides were only concerned with their own interests and ambitions.<ref name=Bajak/> ''[[The Guardian]]'' has also sought out viewpoints from the Venezuelan public. Respondents reiterated many of the core protest themes for their protester support: struggles with shortages in basic goods; crime; mismanagement of oil revenue; international travel struggles caused by difficulties in buying airline tickets and the "bureaucratic nightmare" of buying foreign currency; and frustration over the government's rhetoric regarding the alleged "far-right" nature of the opposition.<ref name=Law>{{cite news|last1=Law|first1=Phillippa|last2=Walsh|first2=James|title=Venezuela protests: demonstrators tell us why they're taking part|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardianwitness-blog/2014/feb/21/venezuela-protests-demonstrators-tell-us-why-theyre-taking-part|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref> Others offered a variety of reasons for not joining the protests, including: support for the government due to improvements in education, healthcare, and public transportation; pessimism over whether Maduro's ouster would lead to meaningful changes; and the belief that a capitalist model would be no more effective than a socialist model in a corrupt government system.<ref name=Walsh>{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=James|last2=Law|first2=Philippa|title=Venezuela protests: the other side of the story|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardianwitness-blog/2014/feb/27/venezuela-protests-the-other-side-of-the-story|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref>

====Protest coverage====
Public support for the protests has also been affected by media coverage. Some outlets have downplayed, and sometimes ignored, the larger daytime protests, allowing the protest movement to be defined by its "tiny, violent ''guarimbero'' clique," whose radicalism undermines support for the mainline opposition and seemingly reinforces the government's narrative of "fascists" working to overthrow the government<ref name=Toro/> in what Maduro described as a "slow motion coup."<ref name=Kurmanaev/> An activist belonging to the [[Justice First]] party said, "Media censorship means people here only know the government version that spoiled rich kids are burning down wealthy parts of Caracas to foment a coup," creating a disconnect between opposition leaders and working-class Venezuelans that keeps protest support from spreading.<ref name=Kurmanaev/>

====Analysis of support====
Some Venezuelans contend that the protests—seen as "rich people trying to get back lost economic perks"—have only served to unite the poor in defense of the revolution.<ref name=Kurmanaev>{{cite magazine|last1=Kurmanaev|first1=Anatoly|last2=Pons|first2=Corina|title=Venezuela Protests Drive Poor to Maduro as Death Toll Mounts|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-13/middle-class-protesting-venezuela-shortages-drive-poor-to-maduro.html|magazine=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref> Analysts such as [[Steve Ellner]], a political science professor at the University of the East in [[Puerto La Cruz]], have expressed doubt over the protests' ultimate effectiveness if the opposition cannot create broader social mobilization.<ref name=Kurmanaev/> Eric Olson, associate director for Latin America at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|Woodrow Wilson International Center]], said disruption caused by protesters had allowed Maduro to use the "greedy economic class" as a [[scapegoat]], which has been an effective narrative for gaining support because people "are more inclined to believe conspiracy theories of price gouging than the intricacies of underlining economic policies."<ref name=Kurmanaev/>

===Poll and survey data===
[[File:President Maduro's approval rating.png|upright=1.82|thumb|right|Approval rating of President Nicolas Maduro.<br/>'''Sources:''' [http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/12/01/para-el-857-de-los-venezolanos-la-situacion-del-pais-es-mala-encuesta-datanalisis/ Datanálisis] ]]
Luis Vicente León, the president of Datanálisis, announced on 6 April his findings that 70% who supported the protests at their start turned to 63% of Venezuelan rejecting the form of protests. He also announced that the results of his latest opinion studies showed President Maduro at between 42% and 45% popularity, while no opposition leader surpassed 40%.<ref>{{cite news|title=LVL: 63% de la población rechaza como se están dando las protestas. No conducirán a ningún lado|url=http://www.noticias24.com/venezuela/noticia/232504/lvl-63-de-los-venezolanos-rechazan-como-se-estan-ejecutando-las-protestas-no-conduciran-a-ningun-lado/|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=Noticias24.com|date=6 April 2014}}</ref> Another Datanálisis poll released on 5 May found that 79.5% of Venezuelans evaluated the country's situation as "negative". Maduro's disapproval rating had risen to 59.2%, up from 44.6% on November 2013. It also found that only 9.6% of the population would support the re-election of Maduro in 2019. The poll revealed that the Democratic Unity Roundtable had an approval rating of 39.6% compared to 50% of those who disapproved it; while the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela had a 37.4% approval rating, and a disapproval rating of 55%.<ref>{{cite news|title=79,5% piensa que el país está mal|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/140505/795-piensa-que-el-pais-esta-mal|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=El Universal|date=5 April 2014}}</ref>

In a poll released on 5 May 2015, Datanálisis found that 77% of respondents did not intend to participate in peaceful protests, while 88% would not participate in protests involving barricades. León attributed this to the criminalization of the protests, fears of government repression, and frustration over the protests' goals not being achieved. The poll also found that 70% would participate in upcoming parliamentary elections—a possible "exhaust valve" for channeling popular discontent—but León noted this represented weakened participation and that Venezuelans were preoccupied with economic and social issues.<ref name=EUmay2015>{{cite news|last1=Rodríguez T.|first1=Carmen M.|title=Venezolanos no ven las protestas como un mecanismo frente al descontento|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/150505/venezolanos-no-ven-las-protestas-como-un-mecanismo-frente-al-desconten|accessdate=20 May 2015|agency=''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]''|date=5 May 2015}}</ref>
