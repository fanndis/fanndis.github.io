'''E-commerce''' ('''electronic commerce''') is the activity of [[electronically]] buying or selling of [[Product (business)|products]] on online services or over the [[Internet]]. Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as [[mobile commerce]], [[electronic funds transfer]], [[supply chain management]], [[Online advertising|Internet marketing]], [[online transaction processing]], [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI), [[Inventory management software|inventory management systems]], and automated [[data collection]] systems. E-commerce is in turn driven by the technological advances of the [[semiconductor industry]], and is the largest sector of the [[electronics industry]].

Modern electronic commerce typically uses the [[World Wide Web]] for at least one part of the transaction's life cycle although it may also use other technologies such as [[Email|e-mail]]. Typical e-commerce transactions include the purchase of online books (such as [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]) and music purchases ([[music download]] in the form of [[digital distribution]] such as [[iTunes Store]]), and to a less extent, customized/personalized online [[liquor store]] [[inventory]] services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/220177/b2c-e-commerce-sales-cagr-forecast-for-selected-countries/|title=Retail e-commerce sales CAGR forecast in selected countries from 2016 to 2021|date=October 2016|website=Statista|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref> There are three areas of e-commerce: [[online retailing]], [[electronic markets]], and [[online auction]]s.

==Governmental regulation==
In the United States, certain electronic commerce activities are regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC). These activities include the use of commercial e-mails, online advertising and [[consumer privacy]]. The [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] establishes national standards for direct marketing over e-mail. The [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] regulates all forms of advertising, including online advertising, and states that advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/ruleroad.shtm | title = Advertising and Marketing on the Internet: Rules of the Road | publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]] | access-date = 27 December 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071226052310/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/ruleroad.shtm | archive-date = 26 December 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Using its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices, the FTC has brought a number of cases to enforce the promises in corporate privacy statements, including promises about the security of consumers' personal information.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/promises.html | title= Enforcing Privacy Promises: Section 5 of the FTC Act | publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}</ref> As a result, any corporate privacy policy related to e-commerce activity may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.

Conflict of laws in cyberspace is a major hurdle for harmonization of legal framework for e-commerce around the world. In order to give a uniformity to e-commerce law around the world, many countries adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996).<ref name="http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/electronic_commerce/1996Model.html">{{cite news|url= http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/electronic_commerce/1996Model.html|title= UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996)

'''Internationally''' there is the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN), which was formed in 1991 from an informal network of government customer fair trade organisations. The purpose was stated as being to find ways of co-operating on tackling consumer problems connected with cross-border transactions in both goods and services, and to help ensure exchanges of information among the participants for mutual benefit and understanding. From this came Econsumer.gov, an ICPEN initiative since April 2001. It is a portal to report complaints about online and related transactions with foreign companies.

There is also '''Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation''' (APEC) was established in 1989 with the vision of achieving stability, security and prosperity for the region through free and open trade and investment. APEC has an Electronic Commerce Steering Group as well as working on common privacy regulations throughout the APEC region.

In '''Australia''', Trade is covered under Australian Treasury Guidelines for electronic commerce and the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]]<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.accc.gov.au/ |title=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission |publisher= [[Australian Federal Government]]}}</ref> regulates and offers advice on how to deal with businesses online,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/54056 | title=Dealing with Businesses Online in Australia | publisher=[[Australian Federal Government]] | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227090216/http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/54056 | archive-date=27 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and offers specific advice on what happens if things go wrong.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/815341 | title= What to do if thing go wrong in Australia | publisher= [[Australian Federal Government]] | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120227084333/http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/815341 | archive-date= 27 February 2012 | df= dmy-all }}</ref>

In '''the United Kingdom''', The [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA)<ref>{{cite web | title = FSA | place = UK | url = http://www.fsa.gov.uk/portal/site/fsa}}</ref>  was formerly the regulating authority for most aspects of the EU's [[Payment Services Directive]] (PSD), until its replacement in 2013 by the [[Prudential Regulation Authority (United Kingdom)|Prudential Regulation Authority]] and the [[Financial Conduct Authority]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0203b99e-797f-11df-b063-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2RAtoYsio |title=Osborne abolishes FSA and boosts Bank |newspaper=Financial Times |author=George Parker and Brooke Masters |date=16 June 2010}}</ref> The UK implemented the PSD through the Payment Services Regulations 2009 (PSRs), which came into effect on 1 November 2009. The PSR affects firms providing payment services and their customers. These firms include banks, non-bank credit card issuers and non-bank merchant acquirers, e-money issuers, etc. The PSRs created a new class of regulated firms known as payment institutions (PIs), who are subject to prudential requirements. Article 87 of the PSD requires the European Commission to report on the implementation and impact of the PSD by 1 November 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/209/introduction/made | title = The Payment Services Regulations 2009 |publisher= Legislation | place = UK |access-date= 17 June 2013}}</ref>

It was a milestone in the course of improving China's electronic commerce legislation, and also marks the entering of China's rapid development stage for electronic commerce legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.efilecabinet.com/the-prc-electronic-signature-law/|title=PRC, Electronic Signature Law|date=28 August 2004}}</ref>

==Forms==
Contemporary electronic commerce can be classified into two categories. The first category is business based on types of goods sold (involves everything from ordering "digital" content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and services, to "meta" services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce). The second category is based on the nature of the participant ([[B2B e-commerce|B2B]], [[Retail|B2C]], [[Consumer-to-business|C2B]] and [[Customer to customer|C2C]]);<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/ecommerce-businesses-understanding-types-1141595|title=Did You Know That There Are 4 Types of Ecommerce?|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-06-01}}</ref>

Recent research clearly indicates that electronic commerce, commonly referred to as e-commerce, presently shapes the manner in which people shop for products. The GCC countries have a rapidly growing market and are characterized by a population that becomes wealthier (Yuldashev). As such, retailers have launched Arabic-language websites as a means to target this population. Secondly, there are predictions of increased mobile purchases and an expanding internet audience (Yuldashev). The growth and development of the two aspects make the GCC countries to become larger players in the electronic commerce market with time progress. Specifically, research shows that e-commerce market is expected to grow to over $20 billion by the year 2020 among these GCC countries (Yuldashev). The e-commerce market has also gained much popularity among the western countries, and in particular Europe and the U.S. These countries have been highly characterized with consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) (Geisler, 34). However, trends show that there are future signs of a reverse. Similar to the GCC countries, there has been increased purchase of goods and services in online channels rather than offline channels. Activist investors are trying hard to consolidate and slash their overall cost and the governments in western countries continue to impose more regulation on CPG manufacturers (Geisler, 36). In these senses, CPG investors are being forced to adapt e-commerce as it is effective as a well as a means for them to thrive.

In 2013, Brazil's e-commerce was growing quickly with retail e-commerce sales expected to grow at a double-digit pace through 2014. By 2016, eMarketer expected retail e-commerce sales in Brazil to reach $17.3 billion.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper = eMarketer | url = http://www.emarketer.com/Article/More-Buyers-Join-Brazils-Robust-Ecommerce-Market/1009725 |title = More Buyers Join Brazil's Robust Ecommerce Market}}</ref> India has an Internet user base of about 460 million as of December 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/topics/2157/internet-usage-in-india/|title=Internet usage in India – Statistics & Facts|website=Statista|access-date=29 December 2017}}</ref> Despite being third largest user base in world, the penetration of Internet is low compared to markets like the United States, United Kingdom or France but is growing at a much faster rate, adding around 6 million new entrants every month.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} In India, cash on delivery is the most preferred payment method, accumulating 75% of the e-retail activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311518414|title=Affect of demonetization on e-commerce – ResearchGate}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} The India retail market is expected to rise from 2.5% in 2016 to 5% in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/in/pdf/2016/08/E-commerce-retail-logistics-India.pdf|title=India's e-commerce retail logistics growth story}}</ref>

The future trends in the GCC countries will be similar with that of the western countries. Despite the forces that push business to adapt e-commerce as a means to sell goods and products, the manner in which customers make purchases is similar in countries from these two regions. For instance, there has been an increased usage of smartphones which comes in conjunction with an increase in the overall internet audience from the regions. Yuldashev writes that consumers are scaling up to more modern technology that allows for mobile marketing.
However, the percentage of smartphone and internet users who make online purchases is expected to vary in the first few years. It will be independent on the willingness of the people to adopt this new trend (The Statistics Portal). For example, UAE has the greatest smartphone penetration of 73.8 percent and has 91.9 percent of its population has access to the internet. On the other hand, smartphone penetration in Europe has been reported to be at 64.7 percent (The Statistics Portal). Regardless, the disparity in percentage between these regions is expected to level out in future because e-commerce technology is expected to grow allowing for more users.
The e-commerce business within these two regions will result in a competition. Government bodies at country level will enhance their measures and strategies to ensure sustainability and consumer protection (Krings, et al.). These increased measures will raise the environmental and social standards in the countries, factors that will determine the success of e-commerce market in these countries. For example, an adoption of tough sanctions will make it difficult for companies to enter the e-commerce market while lenient sanctions will allow ease of companies. As such, the future trends between GCC countries and the Western countries will be independent of these sanctions (Krings, et al.). These countries need to make rational conclusions in coming up with effective sanctions.

The rate of growth of the number of internet users in the Arab countries has been rapid – 13.1% in 2015. A significant portion of the e-commerce market in the Middle East comprises people in the 30–34 year age group. Egypt has the largest number of internet users in the region, followed by Saudi Arabia and Morocco; these constitute 3/4th of the region's share. Yet, internet penetration is low: 35% in Egypt and 65% in Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embitel.com/blog/ecommerce-blog/ecommerce-in-the-middle-east-what-are-the-demographics|title=Ecommerce in the Middle East – What are the demographics?|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref>

For traditional businesses, one research stated that information technology and cross-border e-commerce is a good opportunity for the rapid development and growth of enterprises. Many companies have invested enormous volume of investment in mobile applications. The DeLone and McLean Model stated that three perspectives contribute to a successful e-business: information system quality, service quality and users' satisfaction.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Delone | first1 = W.

== Logistics ==
Logistics in e-commerce mainly concerns fulfillment. Online markets and retailers have to find the best possible way to fill orders and deliver products. Small companies usually control their own logistic operation because they do not have the ability to hire an outside company. Most large companies hire a fulfillment service that takes care of a company's logistic needs.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kawa, Arkadiusz|title=Fulfillment Service in E-Commerce Logistics|journal=Logforum|volume= 13|issue= 4|year= 2017|pages= 429–438|doi=10.17270/J.LOG.2017.4.4|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Impacts==
===Impact on markets and retailers===

E-commerce markets are growing at noticeable rates. The online market is expected to grow by 56% in 2015–2020. In 2017, retail e-commerce sales worldwide amounted to 2.3 trillion US dollars and e-retail revenues are projected to grow to 4.88 trillion US dollars in 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=Retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2021 (in billion U.S. dollars) |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/ |website=www.statista.com |access-date=22 November 2018}}</ref> Traditional markets are only expected 2% growth during the same time. [[Brick and mortar]] retailers are struggling because of online retailer's ability to offer lower prices and higher efficiency. Many larger retailers are able to maintain a presence offline and online by linking physical and online offerings.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

E-commerce allows customers to overcome geographical barriers and allows them to purchase products anytime and from anywhere. Online and traditional markets have different strategies for conducting business. Traditional retailers offer fewer assortment of products because of shelf space where, online retailers often hold no inventory but send customer orders directly to the manufacture. The pricing strategies are also different for traditional and online retailers. Traditional retailers base their prices on store traffic and the cost to keep inventory. Online retailers base prices on the speed of delivery.

There are two ways for marketers to conduct business through e-commerce: fully online or online along with a brick and mortar store. Online marketers can offer lower prices, greater product selection, and high efficiency rates. Many customers prefer online markets if the products can be delivered quickly at relatively low price. However, online retailers cannot offer the physical experience that traditional retailers can. It can be difficult to judge the quality of a product without the physical experience, which may cause customers to experience product or seller uncertainty. Another issue regarding the online market is concerns about the security of online transactions. Many customers remain loyal to well-known retailers because of this issue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhaolin|date=July 2015|title=Online Versus Bricks-And-Mortar Retailing: A Comparison of Price, Assortment and Delivery Time|doi=10.1080/00207543.2014.973074|journal=International Journal of Production Research|volume=53|issue=13|pages=3823–3835|s2cid=111092824}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dimkota|first=Angelika|date=June 2012|title=On Product Uncertainty in Online Markets: Theory and Evidence|url=https://yilihong.github.io/paper/Product%20Uncertainty%20in%20Online%20Markets_Dimoka_Hong_Pavlou2012.pdf|journal=MIS Quarterly|volume=36|issue=2|pages=395–A15|doi=10.2307/41703461|jstor=41703461|s2cid=8963257|access-date=29 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106174640/http://yilihong.github.io/paper/Product%20Uncertainty%20in%20Online%20Markets_Dimoka_Hong_Pavlou2012.pdf|archive-date=6 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Security is a primary problem for e-commerce in developed and developing countries. E-commerce security is protecting business' websites and customers from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. The type of threats include: malicious codes, unwanted programs ([[Adware|ad ware]], [[spyware]]), [[phishing]], [[Hacker|hacking]], and [[Vandalism|cyber vandalism]]. E-commerce websites use different tools to avert security threats. These tools include [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], [[encryption software]], digital certificates, and passwords.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

===Impact on supply chain management===
{{main|Supply chain management}}
For a long time, companies had been troubled by the gap between the benefits which supply chain technology has and the solutions to deliver those benefits. However, the emergence of e-commerce has provided a more practical and effective way of delivering the benefits of the new supply chain technologies.<ref name="ideas.repec.org">{{cite journal|author=Delia, M. |year=2008|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/aes/amfeco/v10y2008i24p236-253.html |title=Impact of E-Commerce in Supply Chain Management|journal=The AMFITEATRU ECONOMIC Journal|volume =10 |issue =24 |pages= 236–253}}</ref>

E-commerce has the capability to integrate all inter-company and intra-company functions, meaning that the three flows (physical flow, financial flow and information flow) of the supply chain could be also affected by e-commerce. The affections on physical flows improved the way of product and inventory movement level for companies. For the information flows, e-commerce optimised the capacity of information processing than companies used to have, and for the financial flows, e-commerce allows companies to have more efficient payment and settlement solutions.<ref name="ideas.repec.org"/>

In addition, e-commerce has a more sophisticated level of impact on supply chains: Firstly, the performance gap will be eliminated since companies can identify gaps between different levels of supply chains by electronic means of solutions; Secondly, as a result of e-commerce emergence, new capabilities such implementing ERP systems, like [[SAP ERP]], [[Xero (software)|Xero]], or Megaventory, have helped companies to manage operations with customers and suppliers. Yet these new capabilities are still not fully exploited. Thirdly, technology companies would keep investing on new e-commerce software solutions as they are expecting investment return. Fourthly, e-commerce would help to solve many aspects of issues that companies may feel difficult to cope with, such as political barriers or cross-country changes. Finally, e-commerce provides companies a more efficient and effective way to collaborate with each other within the supply chain.<ref name="ideas.repec.org"/>

=== Impact on employment ===
E-commerce helps create new job opportunities due to information related services, software app and digital products. It also causes job losses. The areas with the greatest predicted job-loss are retail, postal, and travel agencies. The development of e-commerce will create jobs that require highly skilled workers to manage large amounts of information, customer demands, and production processes. In contrast, people with poor technical skills cannot enjoy the wages welfare. On the other hand, because e-commerce requires sufficient stocks that could be delivered to customers in time, the warehouse becomes an important element. Warehouse needs more staff to manage, supervise and organize, thus the condition of warehouse environment will be concerned by employees.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|title=The impact of e-commerce on international trade and employment |last=Teriz|first=N|date=2011|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.09.010|volume=24|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages=745–753|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Impact on customers ===
E-commerce brings [[convenience]] for customers as they do not have to leave home and only need to browse website online, especially for buying the products which are not sold in nearby shops. It could help customers buy wider range of products and save customers’ time. Consumers also gain power through online shopping. They are able to research products and compare prices among retailers. Also, online shopping often provides sales promotion or discounts code, thus it is more price effective for customers. Moreover, e-commerce provides products’ detailed information; even the in-store staff cannot offer such detailed explanation. Customers can also review and track the order history online.

E-commerce technologies cut transaction costs by allowing both manufactures and consumers to skip through the intermediaries. This is achieved through by extending the search area best price deals and by group purchase. The success of e-commerce in urban and regional levels depend on how the local firms and consumers have adopted to e-commerce.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=43084757|title=E-commerce, Competitiveness and Local and Regional Governance in Greater Manchester and Mersey side: A Preliminary Assessment|journal=Urban Studies|volume=39|issue=5/6|pages=947–975|last1=Evans|first1=Richard|year=2002|doi=10.1080/00420980220128390|s2cid=154155858}}</ref>

However, e-commerce lacks human interaction for customers, especially who prefer face-to-face connection. Customers are also concerned with the security of online transactions and tend to remain loyal to well-known retailers.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Online Retail Industry Profile: United States|publisher=Datamonitor Plc|pages=1–36|year=2012}}</ref> In recent years, clothing retailers such as [[Tommy Hilfiger]] have started adding Virtual Fit platforms to their e-commerce sites to reduce the risk of customers buying the wrong sized clothes, although these vary greatly in their fit for purpose.<ref>{{cite conference|last1=Januszkiewicz|first1=Monika|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Hayes|first3=Steven G.|last4=Gill|first4=Simeon|title=Online Virtual Fit is not yet Fit for Purpose: An Analysis of Fashion e-Commerce Interfaces|conference=3Dbody.tech 2017|date=2017|pages=210–217|doi=10.15221/17.210|isbn=9783033064362|doi-access=free}}</ref> When the customer regret the purchase of a product, it involves returning goods and refunding process.

=== Impact on the environment ===
In 2018, E-commerce generated 1.3 million tons of container [[cardboard]] in North America, an increase from 1.1 million in 2017. Only 35 percent of North American cardboard manufacturing capacity is from recycled content. The recycling rate in Europe is 80 percent and Asia is 93 percent. Amazon, the largest user of [[Cardboard box|boxes]], has a strategy to cut back on packing material and has reduced packaging material used by 19 percent by weight since 2016. Amazon is requiring retailers to manufacture their product packaging in a way that doesn't require additional shipping packaging. Amazon also has an 85-person team researching ways to reduce and improve their packaging and shipping materials.<ref>{{cite news |last=DePillis |first=Lynda |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/16/business/amazon-cardboard-box-prime-day/index.html |title=Amazon's incredible, vanishing cardboard box |work=[[CNN Business]] |date=2019-07-16 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716130808/https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/16/business/amazon-cardboard-box-prime-day/index.html |archive-date=2019-07-16 |access-date=2019-07-17 }}</ref>

=== Impact on traditional retail ===
E-commerce has been cited as a major force for the failure of major U.S. retailers in a trend frequently referred to as a "retail apocalypse."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/features-retail-apocalypse-bankruptcy-stores-closing|title=Retail Apocalypse: These big retailers closing stores, filing for bankruptcy|last=Barrabi|first=Thomas|date=2017-07-14|website=FOXBusiness|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref> The rise of e-commerce outlets like Amazon has made it harder for traditional retailers to attract customers to their stores and forced companies to change their sales strategies.

==Distribution channels==
E-commerce has grown in importance as companies have adopted pure-click and [[Bricks and clicks|brick-and-click]] channel systems. We can distinguish pure-click and brick-and-click channel system adopted by companies.
* Pure-click or pure-play companies are those that have launched a website without any previous existence as a firm.
* Bricks-and-clicks companies are those existing companies that have added an online site for e-commerce.
* Click-to-brick online retailers that later open physical locations to supplement their online efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-10/click-to-brick-why-online-retailers-want-stores-in-real-life |title=Click-to-Brick: Why Online Retailers Want Stores in Real Life |publisher=Business week |date=2013-07-10 |access-date=2014-05-30}}</ref>

E-commerce may take place on retailers' [[Web site]]s or [[mobile apps]], or those of e-commerce marketplaces such as on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], or [[Tmall]] from [[Alibaba Group|AliBaba]]. Those channels may also be supported by [[conversational commerce]], e.g. [[live chat]] or [[chatbot]]s on  Web sites. Conversational commerce may also be standalone such as live chat or chatbots on [[messaging app]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/omnichannel-cross-channel-strategies/retail-s-big-opportunity-87-of-u-s-consumers-grasp-the-power-of-conversational-commerce|title=Retail's Big Opportunity: 87% Of U.S. Consumers Grasp The Power Of Conversational Commerce - Retail TouchPoints|first=Glenn|last=Taylor}}</ref> and via [[voice assistants]].<ref name="venturebeat.com"/>

== Recommendation ==
The contemporary e-commerce trend recommends companies to shift the traditional business model where focus on "standardized products, homogeneous market and long product life cycle" to the new business model where focus on "varied and customized products". E-commerce requires the company to have the ability to satisfy multiple needs of different customers and provide them with wider range of products.

With more choices of products, the information of products for customers to select and meet their needs become crucial. In order to address the mass customization principle to the company, the use of recommender system is suggested. This system helps recommend the proper products to the customers and helps customers make the decision during the purchasing process. The recommender system could be operated through the top sellers on the website, the demographics of customers or the consumers' buying behavior. However, there are 3 main ways of recommendations: recommending products to customers directly, providing detailed products' information and showing other buyers' opinions or critiques. It is benefit for consumer experience without physical shopping. In general, recommender system is used to contact customers online and assist finding the right products they want effectively and directly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Applications of Data Mining to Electronic Commerce|url=https://archive.org/details/applicationsdata00koha|url-access=limited|last1=Schafer|first1=J.
