'''Columbia Business School''' ('''CBS''') is the business school of [[Columbia University|Columbia University in the City of New York]] in [[Manhattan]], New York City. Established in 1916, Columbia Business School is one of the oldest business schools in the world. It is one of six [[Ivy League business schools]].

==History==
[[Image:CBS Logo 1950s.gif|thumb|100px|right|Logo introduced in the 1950s]] 
[[Image:CBS Logo 1990s.gif|thumb|100px|right|Logo introduced in the 1990s]]

The school was founded in 1916 with 11 full-time faculty members and an inaugural class of 61 students, including 8 women. Banking executive Emerson McMillin provided initial funding in 1916, while [[A. Barton Hepburn]], then president of [[Chase National Bank]], provided funding for the School's endowment in 1919. The School expanded rapidly, enrolling 420 students by 1920, and in 1924 added a PhD program to the existing BS and MS degree programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/about-us/history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 8, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502220219/http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/about-us/history |archivedate=May 2, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmXOAAAAMAAJ|title=A History of the Graduate School of Business, Columbia University|first=Thurman William Van|last=Metre|date=July 21, 2018|publisher=Columbia University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>

In 1945, Columbia Business School authorized the awarding of the MBA degree. Shortly thereafter, in the 1950s, the School adopted the [[Hermes]] emblem as its symbol, reflecting the entrepreneurial nature of the Greek god Hermes and his association with business, commerce and communication.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/alumni/news/New-Visual-Identity |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212203915/http://www7.gsb.columbia.edu/alumni/news/New-Visual-Identity |archivedate=December 12, 2011 }}</ref>

In 1952, CBS admitted its last class of undergraduates. The school currently offers executive education programs that culminate in a Certificate in Business Excellence (CIBE) and full alumni status, and several degree programs for the MBA and PhD degrees. In addition to the full-time MBA, the school offers four Executive MBA programs: the NY-EMBA Friday/Saturday program, the EMBA-Global program (launched in 2001 in conjunction with the [[London Business School]]), the EMBA-Americas program launched in 2012,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.veritasprep.com/blog/2012/05/columbia-launches-new-emba-americas-program/ |title=Columbia Launches New EMBA-Americas Program |accessdate=April 13, 2018 }}</ref> and the EMBA-Global Asia program (launched in 2009 in conjunction with the [[London Business School]] and the [[University of Hong Kong|University of Hong Kong Business School]]). Students in jointly run programs earn an MBA degree from each of the cooperating institutions.

On July 1, 2004, [[R. Glenn Hubbard]] became Columbia Business School's eleventh dean. Hubbard, the former chair of President Bush's [[Council of Economic Advisers]], has worked in the private, government and nonprofit sectors, and played a role in shaping national and international economic policy, including the deregulation policy leading up Wall Street bank failures in 2008. In Charles Ferguson's 2010 documentary, ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]'', when prompted, Hubbard strongly maintains that his political and financial connections to government and Wall Street firms do not create any potential academic conflict of interest. Hubbard has announced plans to step down as dean in June 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gee |first1=Kelsey |title=Columbia Business School Dean to Step Down |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/columbia-business-school-dean-to-step-down-1536880116 |accessdate=October 31, 2018 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=September 13, 2018}}</ref>

In June of 2019, Columbia University President, Lee Bollinger, announced that Maglaras had been selected as the 16th Dean of Columbia Business School. Maglaras took office on July 1, 2019, succeeding economist Glenn Hubbard. <ref>School, Columbia Business. "Dr. Costis Maglaras Named 16th Dean Of Columbia Business School". www.prnewswire.com.

Columbia Business School is primarily housed in Uris Hall, at the center of Columbia's [[Morningside Heights]] campus. An auxiliary space, Warren Hall, is situated on [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] and is shared with the [[Columbia Law School|law school]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/06/11/bschool.html|title=Columbia University Announces Business School Plan to Move in First Phase of Proposed Expansion in Manhattanville|accessdate=December 30, 2007|publisher=Columbia University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213143525/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/06/11/bschool.html|archive-date=February 13, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In October 2010, Columbia Business School announced that alumnus [[Henry Kravis]], the billionaire co-founder of private-equity firm [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] (KKR & Co.), pledged $100&nbsp;million to fund expansion of Columbia Business School, the largest gift in its history. The donation will go toward construction of the business school's new site in the [[Manhattanville]] section of New York City, where Columbia University is extending its campus. One of the school's two new buildings will be named for Kravis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0520346620101005|title=KKR's Kravis pledges $100 mln to Columbia|work=Reuters|accessdate=October 10, 2010 | date=October 5, 2010}}</ref> The buildings will be designed by [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-12/columbia-business-school-picks-diller-scofidio-for-new-6-3-billion-campus.html | work=Bloomberg | first=James S. | last=Russell | title=Columbia Business School Picks Diller Scofidio for New Campus | date=January 12, 2011}}</ref>
In December 2012, [[Ronald Perelman]] also donated $100&nbsp;million to the construction of the second business school building.

==MBA program==
The Columbia MBA Program is highly competitive with an admission rate of 16% for the 2017 entering class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/programs/mba/admissions/class-profile|title=MBA Class Profile|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=August 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725040048/http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/programs/mba/admissions/class-profile|archive-date=July 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The student body is highly accomplished and diverse.

The revised core curriculum, launched in the fall of 2008, represents about 40% of the degree requirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/curriculum/corecurriculum|title=Columbia Business School MBA Core Curriculum|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313173924/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/curriculum/corecurriculum|archive-date=March 13, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> It consists of 2 full courses and 12 half-term courses including Corporate Finance, Financial Accounting, Managerial Statistics, Managerial Economics, Leadership, Operations Management, and Marketing Strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/curriculum/corecurriculum|title=Columbia Business School MBA Program Core Curriculum|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313173924/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/curriculum/corecurriculum|archive-date=March 13, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> While the first year of the program is usually devoted to completing the requirements of the core curriculum, the second year provides students with the opportunity to choose from the more than 130 elective courses available at the School and supplement them with more than 4,000 graduate-level classes from the University's other graduate and professional schools.<ref name="http">{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/curriculum/electives|title=Columbia Business School MBA Program Electives|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225164709/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/curriculum/electives|archive-date=February 25, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Among the most popular electives at Columbia Business School are the Economics of Strategic Behavior, Financial Statement Analysis and Earnings Quality, Launching New Ventures, Modern Political Economy, and the Seminar in Value Investing.<ref name="http"/>

Columbia Business School has a firm grade non-disclosure policy, stating that students refrain from disclosing specific class grades, [[Grade Point Average|GPAs]], or transcripts until they accept full-time, post graduation positions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cbsgba.com/culture/grade-non-disclosure-gnd |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111212165436/http://cbsgba.com/culture/grade-non-disclosure-gnd |archive-date=December 12, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Students enter Columbia's MBA program in two tracks.  The traditional fall term is approximately 550 students, while the January term "J-Term" is approximately 200 students.  Students entering in the fall are divided into eight clusters of approximately 65 students that take all first year core classes together. J-Term students are broken into three clusters.  The J-Term is aimed at students who want an accelerated 18-month program who usually plan to return to their previous job, are company sponsored, and will not pursue a summer internship because they take classes during the summer.

The recently launched ''Columbia CaseWorks'' program utilizes the faculty's research and industry experience and brings that perspective into the classroom through the development of new cases and teaching materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/caseworks/about|title=About CaseWorks|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706123837/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/caseworks/about|archive-date=July 6, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Beginning in orientation and continuing through core classes and electives, students are immersed in cases that use faculty research to address real-world business issues. Columbia CaseWorks challenges students to debate corporate decision making and to develop appropriate recommendations and solutions.  During their first year, students study and discuss an integrated case that focuses on a single company and is incorporated into several core courses.  This encourages students to think about a company holistically, analyzing it from the perspective of various disciplines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/versatile |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906191822/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/versatile |archive-date=September 6, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The EMBA program is taught on campus at Columbia University by full-time faculty. The first year of classes consists of the same core curriculum as the Full-Time MBA program. Executive education is the focus of the second year.  This Friday/Saturday program is targeted at individuals with approximately 10 years of work experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/emba/overview/|title=Columbia Business School EMBA Overview|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309011210/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/emba/overview/|archive-date=March 9, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Executive MBA (EMBA) Saturday Program is a 24-month graduate degree program designed for individuals that are looking to enhance their education, but cannot take any time away from work.  This program is the same as the Friday/Saturday program, with the exception that classes only meet on Saturdays over a longer period of time.

In addition to the New York-based EMBA Program, Columbia offers three partner programs to meet the differing needs and geographical distribution of prospective students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/emba/overview/partner/|title=EMBA: Partner Programs|year=2008|accessdate=April 26, 2008|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506153953/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/emba/overview/partner|archive-date=May 6, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Because students in the partner EMBA programs must satisfy the separate requirements of each school, they earn an MBA degree from each participating university. Likewise, they become alumni of each university and business school and may avail themselves of all programs and privileges afforded to alumni.

*The EMBA-Global Americas & Europe program is a 20-month program administered in partnership with the [[London Business School]]. The program enrolls approximately 70 students from around the world per year. Courses are taught by the full-time faculty of both schools. During the first year, the core curriculum classes alternate monthly between the campuses of Columbia University and the London Business School. The core curriculum is similar to that offered in the regular EMBA programs offered separately by each school, but with a more transnational-business emphasis. Second year classes may be selected from the portfolio of EMBA classes offered at either or both partner schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.edu/emba-global/faqs.html |title=FAQs |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |publisher=[[London Business School]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218192454/http://www.london.edu/emba-global/faqs.html |archivedate=December 18, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Admission is highly competitive with 894 applicants in 2010 for positions in an entering class of 18 students (2%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/learnmore/statistics|title=Columbia Business School Doctoral Program Admissions Statistics|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=October 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923215508/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/learnmore/statistics|archive-date=September 23, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> A [[PhD in Management]] or Business is a common precursor to an academic career in business schools.

Throughout the program, students become familiar with research methods and the literature of their major fields through research projects and directed reading.<ref name="gsb.columbia.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/academics/overview|title=Columbia Business School Doctoral Program Overview|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303014127/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/academics/overview|archive-date=March 3, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Doctoral candidates begin the program mastering basic research tools by studying subjects such as economics, behavioral science and quantitative methods, in addition to completing course work and examinations in the major field of study. The completion of course work and qualifying examinations normally requires two to three years.

The research phase begins as early as the first year, when students serve as research assistants, and continues throughout their time at the School.<ref name="gsb.columbia.edu"/> Students gradually become more involved in the design and execution of research and, by the end of the second year, have typically produced at least one paper suitable for publication, often as coauthor with a faculty member. The later years of the program are dedicated to original research and the creation of the dissertation.

Recent Columbia PhD program graduates have placed in the following institutions: Harvard Business School, Wharton School, 
London Business School, Kellogg School of Management, Cornell University, University of Notre Dame, Stern School of Business, University of Minnesota, Fordham University, Polytechnic University, Baruch College, University of Washington, EWHA Womans University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Toronto, IAE Business and Management School, Universidad Austral, and University of Texas at Austin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/whycolumbia/placement/|title=Columbia Business School Doctoral Program Placement|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309205800/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/whycolumbia/placement/|archive-date=March 9, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>
