===Command and control===
On 5 March 2011, opposition forces radio in [[Benghazi]] announced the creation of the [[National Transitional Council]], a political body with 33 representatives from most Libyan regions. The [[List of heads of state of Libya|Chairman of the Council]] is [[Mustafa Abdul Jalil]], [[Abdul Hafiz Ghoga]] is the Vice-Chairman, and [[Mahmoud Jibril]] is the [[List of heads of government of Libya|Chairman of the Executive Board]]. [[Omar El-Hariri]] was the head of military affairs until May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntclibya.com/InnerPage.aspx?SSID=7&ParentID=3&LangID=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522091355/http://www.ntclibya.com/InnerPage.aspx?SSID=7&ParentID=3&LangID=1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-05-22 |title=The Libyan Interim National Council |publisher=ntclibya.com |accessdate=2011-11-02 }}</ref> Then later that month the position was renamed to Minister of Defense and [[Jalal al-Digheily]] was assigned to that position. On 8 August 2011, Jalala along with 14 other members of the Executive Board were fired, and the position left vacant but was reappointed in early October 2011 after continuing in the role of interim defense minister for almost two months.<ref name="newcab">{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/2011103124138235256.html|agency=Al Jazeera English|title=Jibril vows to quit after Libya 'liberation'|date=3 October 2011|accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref>

The Commander-in-Chief was General [[Abdul Fatah Younis]] until his death in July 2011. [[Suleiman Mahmoud]], Younis's top lieutenant, replaced him as army commander. Colonel [[Khalifa Haftar]] was another top military commander. The army was organized into brigades, with rebel fighters bearing identity cards.<ref>{{cite news|title=Libyan Rebels Get Organized|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/04/201141942947854663.html|newspaper=Aljazeera}}</ref>

===Weapons and vehicles===
The Libyan opposition was mainly using vehicles and weapons captured from government forces or depots.  The opposition had only had access to [[T-55]] tanks and a very small amount of [[T-72]] tanks captured during the [[Second Battle of Benghazi]]. News coverage commonly showed rebels driving ordinary cars and [[technical (vehicle)|technicals]] near battle areas. On 9 March 2011, a report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies said: "Apart from a few mechanized units in Benghazi and Tobruk, and a few armored battalions near Bayda, rebel-controlled areas lack any substantial hardware with which to take on the pro-Gaddafi stronghold of Tripoli."<ref>{{cite web|title=Libyan Rebels' Weapons Deficit|url=http://www.iiss.org/whats-new/iiss-voices/?blogpost=146|publisher=International Institute for Strategic Studies}}</ref> However, two fighter jets defected from Gaddafi and joined the rebels and were used during the [[Battle of Ajdabiya]] and damaged an armed oiler tanker and possibly two others. They also gained several helicopters from defected units based in Benghazi, these aircraft forming the [[Free Libyan Air Force]]. One of these aircraft, a Soviet-made [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23BN]], was shown having been shot down in a [[friendly fire]] incident over Benghazi after it was mistaken for an enemy aircraft.

They had also captured a large number of [[ZU-23-2]] and [[ZPU]] [[anti-aircraft guns]], as well as [[rocket propelled grenade|rocket-propelled grenade]]s, [[KPV heavy machine gun|KPV]] [[14.5×114mm]] [[DShK|Dshk machine gun]]s, [[FN FAL]], [[F2000]] and [[AK-47]] rifles, and [[FN MAG]], [[AA-52 machine gun|AA-52]] and [[PK machine gun]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Libya's uncertain front lines|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/03/20113234914145322.html|work=Al Jazeera}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrum-belli.com/media/02/00/3650079973.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201224222/http://www.theatrum-belli.com/media/02/00/3650079973.jpg |archivedate=1 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/world/africa/21rebels.html?_r=2&ref=world | title = Inferior Arms Hobble Rebels in Libya War|author= C.J.

In addition to conventional and improvised weapons, there was a surprising amount of sophistication among rebel equipment, with some even fashioning [[unmanned ground vehicle]]s from remote-controlled toy cars and the like.<ref>{{cite news|title=Libyan rebels built combat robots, remotely operated weapon systems|agency=Innovation News Daily|date=15 June 2011|url=http://www.technewsdaily.com/2742-libyan-rebels-military-robot.html}}</ref>

==Human rights violations==

The government of Chad asked the NATO coalition forces to protect its citizens in rebel-held areas of Libya. The Chadian government claims that dozens of its citizens have been executed after being accused of being mercenaries for Gaddafi.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE73303S20110404 | work=Reuters | title=Chad says citizens abused in rebel-held Libya | date=4 April 2011}}</ref>
