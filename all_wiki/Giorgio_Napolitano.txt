Due to his dominant position in [[Italian politics]], some critics have sometimes referred to him as ''Re Giorgio'' ("King George").<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/03/world/europe/president-giorgio-napolitano-italys-quiet-power-broker.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |title=From Ceremonial Figure to Italy's Quiet Power Broker |date=2 December 2011 |first=Rachel |last=Donadio |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> He is the [[List of Presidents of Italy by time in office|longest serving]] president in the [[history of the Italian Republic|history of the modern Italian Republic]], which has been in existence since 1946.

Although the presidency is a nonpartisan office as guarantor of Italy's Constitution, Napolitano was a longtime member of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (and of its post-Communist social democratic successors, from the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] onwards). He was a leading member of [[Meliorism (politics)|a modernizing faction]] on the right of the party. First elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] in 1953, he took an assiduous interest in parliamentary life and was [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|President of the Chamber of Deputies]] from 1992 to 1994. He was [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] from 1996 to 1998 [[Prodi I Cabinet|under Romano Prodi]].

Napolitano was appointed a [[List of senators for life in Italy|Senator for Life]] in 2005 by President [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]]. In May 2006, he was [[2006 Italian presidential election|elected by Parliament]] as President of Italy. During his first term of office, he oversaw governments both of the [[centre-left]], [[Prodi II Cabinet|led by Prodi]], and the [[centre-right]], [[Berlusconi IV Cabinet|led by Silvio Berlusconi]]. In November 2011, Berlusconi resigned as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] amid financial and economic problems.  Napolitano, in keeping with his [[Constitution of Italy|constitutional role]], then asked former [[European Union|EU]] commissioner [[Mario Monti]] to form [[Monti Cabinet|a cabinet]] which was referred to as a "government of the president" by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.repubblica.it/politica/2011/11/14/news/editoriale_mauro-24969049/|title=Il governo del presidente|date=14 November 2011|website=La Repubblica}}</ref>

When his seven-year presidential term expired in April 2013, Napolitano (then aged 87) reluctantly accepted re-election, becoming the first President of Italy to serve a second term, to safeguard the continuity of the country's institutions during the parliamentary deadlock that followed [[2013 Italian general election|the 2013 general election]]. On being [[2013 Italian presidential election|reelected as President]] with broad cross-party support in Parliament, he overcame the impasse by inviting [[Enrico Letta]] to propose [[Letta Cabinet|a government]] in the form of a [[Grand coalition (Italy)|grand coalition]]. When Letta handed in his resignation on 14 February 2014, Napolitano mandated [[Matteo Renzi]] (Letta's factional challenger) to form a new government. After a record eight and a half years as President, Napolitano resigned at age 89 in January 2015.<ref name=bbcresig>{{cite web|publisher=BBC|title=Italian President Napolitano announces retirement|date=14 January 2015|accessdate=17 January 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30810461}}</ref>

Napolitano was often accused by his critics of having transformed a largely ceremonial role into a political one, becoming, during the years of his tenure, the real [[kingmaker]] of the Italian politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/14_febbraio_15/grillo-napolitano-monarca-medievale-42db2288-963e-11e3-9817-5b9e59440d59.shtml|title=Grillo: "Napolitano monarca medievale" Montecitorio: ecco le "controconsultazioni"|date=15 February 2014|website=Corriere della Sera}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://formiche.net/2013/09/napolitano-il-monarca-indispensabile/|title=Napolitano, il monarca indispensabile|first=Fabrizia|last=Argano|date=11 September 2013|website=Formiche.net}}</ref> As of 2020, Napolitano is currently the [[List of Italian Presidents by longevity|only living former Italian President]].

== Early life ==
Giorgio Napolitano was born in [[Naples]], in 1925.  His father, Giovanni, was a [[Liberalism|liberal]] lawyer and poet; his mother was Carolina Bobbio, a descendant of a noble [[Piedmont]]ese family.

From 1938 to 1941 he studied at the [[Classical Lyceum Umberto I]] of Naples, but in 1941 his family moved to [[Padova]] and he was graduated to the lyceum [[Titus Livius]].  In 1942, he matriculated at the [[University of Naples Federico II]], studying law.  During this period, Napolitano adhered to the local University Fascist Youth ("Gioventù Universitaria Fascista"), where he met his core group of friends, who shared his opposition to [[Italian fascism]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Mirella Serri|title=I redenti|publisher= [[Corbaccio]] | year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Simone Duranti|title=Lo spirito gregario I gruppi universitari fascisti tra politica e propaganda (1930-1940)|publisher=Donzelli| year=2008|url=http://www.donzelli.it/libro/1783/lo-spirito-gregario}}</ref>  As he would later state, the group "was in fact a true breeding ground of [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] intellectual energies, disguised and to a certain extent tolerated".<ref name="autobio">{{cite book | last = Napolitano | first = Giorgio | year = 2005 | title = Dal Pci al socialismo europeo. Un'autobiografia politica | publisher = Laterza | location = | language = Italian | isbn = 88-420-7715-1}}</ref>

An enthusiast of the theatre since secondary school, during his university years he contributed a theatrical review to the ''IX Maggio'' weekly magazine and had small parts in plays organized by the ''Gioventù Universitaria Fascista'' itself.  He played in a comedy by [[Salvatore Di Giacomo]] at [[Teatro Mercadante]] in Naples.  Napolitano dreamt of being an actor and spent his early years performing in several productions at the Teatro Mercadante.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Napolitano has often been cited as the author of a collection of [[sonnet]]s in [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan dialect]] published under a [[pseudonym]], Tommaso Pignatelli, and entitled ''Pe cupià ’o chiarfo'' ("To mimic the downpour").  He denied this in 1997 and, again, on the occasion of his presidential election, when his staff described the attribution of authorship to Napolitano as a "journalistic myth".<ref>{{cite web | author=La Repubblica | title=Governo, Napolitano annuncia "Martedì inizio le consultazioni" | url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/05/sezioni/politica/nuovo-presidente-5/napolitano-attesa-lunedi/napolitano-attesa-lunedi.html | accessdate=13 May 2006 |language=Italian| author-link=La Repubblica }}</ref>  He published his first acknowledged book, entitled ''Movimento Operaio e Industria di Stato'' (which can be translated as "Workers' Movement and State Industry"), in 1962.<ref name="quirinale.it">{{citation |url=http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/lingue/en/en-nap-biografia.htm |title=The President Giorgio Napolitano - biography |accessdate=31 January 2014 |website=Presidenza della Repubblica}}</ref>

=== World War II ===
{{Main|Italian resistance movement}}
During the existence of the [[Italian Social Republic]] (1943–1945), a puppet state of [[Nazi Germany]] in the final period of World War II, Napolitano and his circle of friends took part in several actions of the [[Italian resistance movement]] against German and Italian fascist forces.<ref name="graziani">{{cite web | author=Graziani, Nicola | title=Quirinale: Giorgio Napolitano, il compagno gentiluomo | url=http://www.agi.it/news.pl?doc=200605101328-1101-RT1-CRO-0-NF81&page=0&id=agionline.italyonline | accessdate=13 May 2006|language=Italian}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

== Early political career ==

=== From post-war years to the Hungarian revolution ===
{{Main|Italian Communist Party}}
In 1944, along with the group of Neapolitan Communists, as Mario Palermo and [[Maurizio Valenzi]], Napolitano prepared the arrival in Naples of [[Palmiro Togliatti]], the long-time leader of the [[Italian Communist Party]] who was in exile since 1926 when the [[Communist Party of Italy]] was banned by the Italian Fascist government, and Togliatti was one of few leaders not to be arrested, as he was attending a meeting of the [[Comintern]] in [[Moscow]].

Following the end of the war in 1945, Napolitano joined the Communist Party and suddenly became its federal secretary for [[Naples]] and [[Caserta]]. In 1947, he graduated in [[jurisprudence]] with a final dissertation on political economy, entitled ''Il mancato sviluppo industriale del Mezzogiorno dopo l'unità e la legge speciale per Napoli del 1904'' ("The lack of industrial development in the [[Mezzogiorno]] following [[Italian unification|the unification of Italy]] and the special law of 1904 for Naples").<ref name="off-bio">{{cite web | author=Quirinale.it | title=Biography | url=http://www.quirinale.it/presidente/altrelingue/inglese/presidente-en.htm | accessdate=11 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070128072228/http://www.quirinale.it/presidente/altrelingue/inglese/presidente-en.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 28 January 2007}}</ref> He became a member of the Secretariat of the Italian Economic Centre for Southern Italy in 1946, which was represented by Senator Paratore, where he remained for two years. Napolitano played a major role in the Movement for the Rebirth of Southern Italy for over ten years.<ref name="quirinale.it"/>

He was first [[1953 Italian general election|elected]] to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] in 1953 for the electoral district of [[Naples]], and was reelected in every election until [[1996 Italian general election|1996]].<ref name="off-bio"/> He was elected to the National Committee of the party during its eighth national congress in 1956, largely thanks to the support offered by Palmiro Togliatti, who wanted to involve younger politicians in the central direction of the party. He became responsible for the commission for [[Southern Italy]] within the National Committee.<ref name="camera">{{cite web | author=Camera.it | title=Il Presidente Giorgio Napolitano | url=http://legxiv.camera.it/organiparlamentarism/6611/6558/6559/6570/documentotesto.asp | accessdate=11 February 2007|language=Italian}}</ref>

In 1953 a document of the Italian Ministry of Interior reported Napolitano as a member of the secret armed paramilitary groups of the Communist Party in the city of Rome (so-called "Gladio Rossa")
<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iltempo.it/politica/2015/01/14/gallery/quando-il-signor-cardinale-sognava-la-rivoluzione-nostrana-965382/|title=Quando il signor "Cardinale" sognava la rivoluzione nostrana|website=www.iltempo.it}}</ref>

Later on in the same year, the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and its military suppression by the [[Soviet Union]] occurred. The leadership of the Italian Communist Party labelled the insurgents as counter-revolutionaries, and the official party newspaper ''[[L'Unità]]'' referred to them as "thugs" and "despicable agents provocateurs". Napolitano complied with the party-sponsored position on this matter, a choice he would repeatedly declare to have become uncomfortable with, developing what his autobiography describes as a "grievous self-critical torment". He would reason that his compliance was motivated by concerns about the role of the Italian Communist Party as "inseparable from the fates of the socialist forces guided by the USSR" as opposed to "imperialist" forces.<ref name="autobio" />

The decision to support the USSR against the Hungarian revolutionaries generated a split in the Italian Communist Party, and even the [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|CGIL]] (Italy's largest [[trade union]], then supportive of the PCI) refused to conform to the party-sponsored position and applauded the revolution, on the basis that the eighth national congress of the Italian Communist Party had indeed stated that the "Italian way to socialism" was to be democratic and specific to the nation. These views were supported in the party by [[Giorgio Amendola]], whom Napolitano would always look up to as a teacher. Frequently seen together, Giorgio Amendola and Giorgio Napolitano would jokingly be referred to by friends as (respectively) ''Giorgio 'o chiatto'' and ''Giorgio 'o sicco'' ("Giorgio the pudgy" and "Giorgio the slim" in the [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan dialect]]).<ref name="corriere">{{cite web | work=[[Corriere della Sera]] | title="Principe rosso", violò il tabù del Viminale | url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Politica/2006/05_Maggio/08/principe-rosso.shtml | accessdate=11 February 2007 | language=Italian}}</ref>

== Leading member of the Communist Party ==

=== From the 1960s to 1980s ===
{{Main|Italian Socialist Party|Popular Democratic Front (Italy)}}
[[File:Nicolae Ceauşescu a lui Giorgio Napolitano.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Napolitano with Romanian President [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] in 1974.]]
Between 1963 and 1966, Napolitano was party chairman in the city of Naples and later, between 1966 and 1969, he was appointed as chairman of the secretary's office and of the political office. In 1964, following the death of Palmiro Togliatti, Napolitano was one of the main leaders who supported an alliance with the [[Italian Socialist Party]], which after the end of the so-called "[[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]]" joined the government with the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]). During the 1970s and 1980s, Napolitano was in charge for cultural activities, [[economic policy]] and the [[international relations]] of the party.

Napolitano's political thought was somewhat moderate in the context of the PCI: in fact, he became the leader of the so-called [[meliorism (politics)|meliorist]] wing (''corrente migliorista'') of the party, whose members notably included [[Gerardo Chiaromonte]] and Emanuele Macaluso. The term ''migliorista'' (from ''migliore'', Italian for "better") was coined with a slightly mocking intent. To be a ''betterist'' was regarded more negatively than to be a ''reformist'' by traditional Communists.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

[[File:Berlinguer Napolitano.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Napolitano with [[Enrico Berlinguer]].]]
In the mid-1970s, Napolitano was invited by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to give a lecture, but the United States [[ambassador]] to Italy, [[John A. Volpe]], refused to grant Napolitano a [[visa (document)|visa]] on account of his membership of the PCI. Between 1977 and 1981 Napolitano had some secret meetings with the United States ambassador [[Richard N. Gardner|Richard Gardner]], at a time when the PCI was seeking contact with the US administration, in the context of its definitive break with its past relationship with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the beginning of [[eurocommunism]], the attempt to develop a theory and practice more adapted to the democratic countries of Western Europe. He was an active member of the party until it ended in 1991.<ref name="mahalo.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.mahalo.com/giorgio-napolitano/ |title=Giorgio Napolitano |publisher=Mahalo.com |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref>  In 2006, when Napolitano was elected President of the Italian Republic, Gardner stated to [[Associated Press|AP Television News]] that he considered Napolitano "a real statesman", "a true believer in democracy" and "a friend of the United States [who] will carry out his office with impartiality and fairness".<ref>{{cite news | publisher=CNN | title=Italy finally agrees on president | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/05/10/italy.president.ap/index.html | accessdate=13 May 2006}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

Thanks to this role and in part by the good offices of [[Giulio Andreotti]], in the 1980s Napolitano was able to travel to the United States and give lectures at [[Aspen, Colorado]] and at [[Harvard University]]. He has since visited and lectured in the United States several times.

After the death of [[Enrico Berlinguer]] in 1984, Napolitano was among the possible successors as Secretary of the party, but [[Alessandro Natta]] was preferred. In July 1989 Napolitano became Foreign Minister in the PCI shadow government, from which he resigned the day after the Congress of [[Rimini]], where advocates for processing into [[Democratic Party of the Left]].

=== President of the Chamber of Deputies ===
{{Main|Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|List of Presidents of the Italian Chamber of Deputies}}
In 1992 he was elected [[List of Presidents of the Italian Chamber of Deputies|President of the Chamber of Deputies]], replacing [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]], who became [[President of the Italian Republic]]. That legislature was hit by "[[Tangentopoli]]" and his presidency became one of the fronts of the relationship between the judiciary and politics.

=== Late 1990s and early 2000s ===
{{Main|1996 Italian general election}}
After the [[1996 Italian general election|1996 general election]], the centre-left Prime Minister [[Romano Prodi]] selected him as [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]]. He was the first former Communist to hold the office, a role traditionally occupied by [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]]. In this capacity, he took part, together with fellow lawmaker and Cabinet Minister [[Livia Turco]], in drafting the government-sponsored law on immigration control (Legislative Decree No. 40 6 March 1998), better known as the "Turco–Napolitano bill". Napolitano remained Minister of the Interior until October 1998, when Prodi's government lost its majority in the Parliament.

Napolitano also served a second term as an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] from 1999 to 2004 as member of the [[Party of European Socialists]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home|title=Home &#124; MEPs &#124; European Parliament|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> In October 2005, he was named [[List of senators for life in Italy|Senator for Life]], and was, therefore, one of the last two to be appointed by [[List of presidents of Italy|President of the Republic]] [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]], together with [[Sergio Pininfarina]].

== Election as President ==
{{Main|2006 Italian presidential election}}

The [[2006 Italian general election|general election]] in April 2006 saw a victory of the centre-left candidate [[Romano Prodi]] against the incumbent conservative Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. After the election, the Presidents of both houses of parliament were chosen by the winning centre-left coalition, and so the centre-right [[House of Freedoms]] demanded an impartial candidate for the role of President of the Republic. [[The Union (Italy)|The Union]] stressed the fact that the Italian Constitution demands that the President be a defender of the constitution, hinting that such a quality was scarce among the opposition members.

[[File:Prodi Napolitano.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Giorgio Napolitano with Prime Minister [[Romano Prodi]], in 2006.]]
Silvio Berlusconi was the most vocal opponent of any candidate that came from the former [[Italian Communist Party]], in line with the anti-communist stance he had taken in the campaign. His allies, especially the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] (UDC), openly disagreed with his intransigence but vowed to stick with their ally's decision. Yet, when Napolitano was elected, Silvio Berlusconi gave an interview to one of his political magazines [[Panorama (Italian magazine)|Panorama]] saying that the UDC betrayed him by letting 60 of his electors cast a blank vote on the first ballot, instead of supporting the official candidate [[Gianni Letta]]. When the UDC argued that this might have spelt the end of the Coalition, Silvio Berlusconi quickly changed his stance by saying, as he often had, that he had been "misunderstood" and that he never gave that journalist an interview.

The candidacy of [[Massimo D'Alema]] was supported by his party, the [[Democrats of the Left]], and by other parties of the coalition, such as the [[Party of Italian Communists]], the [[Communist Refoundation Party]] and [[Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy]], but opposed by others, such as the [[Rose in the Fist]], arguing that his candidacy was driven by a [[particracy|particracy's]] mentality. Also, part of the left-wing coalition considered D'Alema far too willing to conduct backroom deals with the opposition. Some moderate journalists liked D'Alema because his presidency would have given [[Romano Prodi]] a stable government since the biggest party of the Union had not been rewarded with any institutional position.

In the opposition coalition, while Silvio Berlusconi vehemently opposed a D'Alema presidency, some of his aides, such as [[Marcello Dell'Utri]], and some aligned newspapers, such as [[Il Foglio]], campaigned for D'Alema. However, the official stance of the centre-right was that D'Alema, being an important left-wing politician and having participated in the election campaign, was ill-suited for president, a role that it is supposed to be impartial.

However, when The Union proposed Giorgio Napolitano, the House of Freedom objected that the Union should have presented a list of names. Even though Napolitano appeared at first a candidate that the House of Freedoms could converge on, the proposal was rejected much like that of D'Alema.

The centre-left majority coalition, on 7 May 2006, officially endorsed Napolitano as its candidate in the [[2006 Italian presidential election|presidential election]] that began on 8 May. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] endorsed him as President through its official newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', just after The Union named him as its candidate, as did [[Marco Follini]], former secretary of the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]], a member party of the House of Freedoms.

Napolitano was elected on 10 May, in the fourth round of voting — the first of those requiring only an absolute majority, unlike the first three which required two-thirds of the votes — with 543 votes (out of a possible 1009).  At the age of 80, he became the first former Communist to become President of Italy, as well as the third Neapolitan after [[Enrico De Nicola]] and [[Giovanni Leone]]. He came out of retirement to accept.<ref name="mahalo.com"/> After his election, expressions of esteem toward him personally as regarding his authoritative character as future [[President of the Italian Republic]] were made by both members of The Union and of the House of Freedoms (which had turned in [[blank vote]]s), such as [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]].<ref>{{cite web | author=La Repubblica | title=Da Berlusconi auguri con freddezza.

On 9 July 2006, Napolitano was present at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]] final, in which the [[Italy national football team|Italian team]] defeated France and won its fourth World Cup, and afterwards he joined the players' celebrations. He is the second President of the Italian Republic to be present at a FIFA World Cup final won by the Italian team, after [[Sandro Pertini]] in 1982.

On 26 September 2006, Napolitano made an official visit to [[Budapest]], Hungary, where he paid tribute to the fallen in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 revolution]], which he initially opposed as member of the Italian Communist Party, by laying a wreath at [[Imre Nagy|Imre Nagy's]] grave.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[International Herald Tribune]]|title=Italy's president pays tribute in Hungary to 1956 revolution|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/26/europe/EU_GEN_Hungary_Italy_1956.php|accessdate=6 October 2006}}</ref>

On 10 February 2007 a [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] crisis arose between Italy and [[Croatia]] after President Napolitano made an official speech during the celebration of the [[National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe]] in which he stated:
{{Quote|...Already in the unleashing of the first wave of blind and extreme violence in those lands, in the autumn of 1943, summary and tumultuous justicialism, nationalist paroxysm, social retaliation and a plan to eradicate Italian presence intertwined in what was, and ceased to be, the Julian March.
There was, therefore, a movement of hate and bloodthirsty fury, and a Slavic annexationist design, which prevailed above all in the peace treaty of 1947, and assumed the sinister shape of "ethnic cleansing".
What we can say for sure is that what was consumed – in the most evident way through the inhuman ferocity of the ''foibe'' – was one of the barbarities of the past century.<ref>Presidenza della Repubblica, Giorgio Napolitano, official speech for the celebration of "Giorno del Ricordo" Quirinal, 10 February 2007 [http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/Continua.aspx?tipo=Discorso&key=930 integral text from official website of the Italian President Bureau] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114215033/http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/Continua.aspx?tipo=Discorso&key=930 |date=14 January 2012 }}</ref><ref>''«....Già nello scatenarsi della prima ondata di cieca violenza in quelle terre, nell'autunno del 1943, si intrecciarono giustizialismo sommario e tumultuoso, parossismo nazionalista, rivalse sociali e un disegno di sradicamento della presenza italiana da quella che era, e cessò di essere, la Venezia Giulia. Vi fu dunque un moto di odio e di furia sanguinaria, e un disegno annessionistico slavo, che prevalse innanzitutto nel Trattato di pace del 1947, e che assunse i sinistri contorni di una "pulizia etnica". Quel che si può dire di certo è che si consumò – nel modo più evidente con la disumana ferocia delle foibe – una delle barbarie del secolo scorso.»'' from the official website of The Presidency of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, [http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/Continua.aspx?tipo=Discorso&key=930 official speech for the celebration of "Giorno del Ricordo"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114215033/http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/Continua.aspx?tipo=Discorso&key=930 |date=14 January 2012 }} Quirinal, Rome, 10 February 2007</ref>}}

The European Commission did not comment on this event, but did comment on (and partly condemn) the response by Croatian president [[Stjepan Mesić]], who described Napolitano's statement as racist because Napolitano did not refer to either Slovenians or Croatians as a nation when he spoke about a "Slavic annexationist design" for the [[Julian March]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unita.it/view.asp?IDcontent=63512|title=l'Unità.it – Giorgio Napolitano: "Foibe ignorate per cecità e calcolo"|publisher=Unita|date=20 September 2008|accessdate=14 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030817/http://www.unita.it/view.asp?IDcontent=63512|archivedate=27 September 2007}}</ref> (at the time, Slovenians and Croatians fought together in the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Resistance Movement]]). Another matter of debate in Croatia was that the Italian President made awards to relatives of 25 foibe victims, who included the last fascist Italian [[prefect]] in [[Zadar]], Vincenzo Serrentino, who was sentenced to death in 1947 in [[Šibenik]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ravennainforma.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930002539/http://www.ravennainforma.com/news.php?id=2965|url-status=dead|title=Ravennainforma - Judi Online - Poker Online - Ceme Online - IDN Poker|archivedate=30 September 2007|website=Ravennainforma|accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://www.alleanzanazionalelodi.it/an2005/dettagli.asp?id=&eventid=4420 Alleanzanazionalelodi.it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009163658/http://www.alleanzanazionalelodi.it/an2005/dettagli.asp?id=&eventid=4420 |date=9 October 2007 }}</ref> That was seen by Mesić as "historic revisionism" and open support for [[revanchism]]. President Napolitano's remarks on the foibe massacres were praised by both centre-left and centre-right in Italy, and both coalitions condemned Mesić's statements, while the whole of Croatia stood by Mesić, who later acknowledged that Napolitano didn't want to put in discussion the [[Treaty of peace with Italy (1947)|Peace Treaty]] of 1947.

=== 2008 political crisis ===
{{Main|2008 Italian political crisis}}
On 24 January 2008, [[Romano Prodi]] lost a vote of confidence in the Senate by a vote of 161 to 156 votes, after the [[UDEUR Populars for the South|UDEUR Populars]] ended its support for the [[Prodi II Cabinet|Prodi-led government]].<ref name="BBC loses">{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7208000.stm|title=Prodi loses crucial Senate vote|publisher=BBC|date=24 January 2008|accessdate=24 January 2008}}</ref>

On 30 January, Napolitano appointed the President of the Senate [[Franco Marini]] to try to form a caretaker government with the goal of changing the current electoral system, rather than call a quick election.<ref name="Corriere Marini">{{cite web | url = http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_30/casini_no_marini_6ef4ecdc-cf16-11dc-8e3f-0003ba99c667.shtml | title = Crisi, Napolitano incarica Marini | publisher = [[Corriere della Sera]] | date = 30 January 2008 | accessdate = 30 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131081433/http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_30/casini_no_marini_6ef4ecdc-cf16-11dc-8e3f-0003ba99c667.shtml| archivedate= 31 January 2008 | url-status= live|language=it}}</ref> The state of the [[Voting system|electoral system]] had been under criticism not only within the outgoing government, but also among the opposition and in the general population, because of the impossibility to choose candidates directly and of the risks that a close-call election may not grant a stable majority in the Senate.

[[File:Berlusconi Napolitano.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Napolitano with [[Silvio Berlusconi]], in 2008.]]
After Marini was given the mandate, two politicians ([[Bruno Tabacci]] and [[Mario Baccini]]) splintered from the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] to form the [[White Rose (Italy)|White Rose]], while two leading members of the [[Forza Italia]] faction Liberal-Popular Union ([[Ferdinando Adornato]] and [Angelo Sanza) switched allegiance to the UDC. On 4 February, the [[Liberal Populars]] (a UDC faction which favours merging with Forza Italia) seceded from UDC to join Berlusconi's [[The People of Freedom|People of Freedom]] later this year.

On 7 May 2008, President Napolitano appointed [[Silvio Berlusconi]] as Prime Minister, following his [[landslide victory]] in the [[2008 Italian general election|general election]].

==== Renzi Cabinet ====
{{Main|2013 Democratic Party (Italy) leadership election|Renzi Cabinet}}
In the [[2013 Democratic Party (Italy) leadership election|December election]], the young Mayor of [[Florence]] [[Matteo Renzi]] was elected with 68% of the popular vote, compared to 18% for Gianni Cuperlo and 14% for Giuseppe Civati. He became the new Secretary of the Democratic Party and the centre-left's prospective candidate for [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]]. His victory was welcomed by Prime Minister Enrico Letta, who had been the Vice Secretary of the party under Bersani's leadership.

In an earlier speech, Renzi had paid tribute to Letta, saying that he was not intended to put him "on trial". But, without directly proposing himself as the next Prime Minister, he said the Eurozone's third-largest economy urgently needed "a new phase" and "radical programme" to push through badly-needed reforms. The motion he put forward made clear "the necessity and urgency of opening a new phase with a new executive". Speaking privately to party leaders, Renzi said that Italy was "at a crossroads" and faced either holding fresh elections or a new government without a return to the polls.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lizzy Davies in Rome|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/13/italian-pm-enrico-letta-to-resign|title=Italian PM Enrico Letta to resign|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 February 2014}}</ref> On 14 February, President Napolitano accepted Letta's resignation from the office of Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/world/20140214/994925256.html| script-title=ru:Правительственный кризис в Италии: премьер Летта ушел в отставку|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|language=Russian|date=14 February 2014|accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref>
