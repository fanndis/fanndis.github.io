'''Concord''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|ŋ|k|ər|d}}) is a town in [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]], in the United States. At the 2010 census, the town population was 17,668.<ref name="Census 2010">{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Concord town, Middlesex County, Massachusetts |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=April 6, 2012 }}</ref> The [[United States Census Bureau]] considers Concord part of [[Greater Boston]]. The town center is near where the [[confluence]] of the [[Sudbury River|Sudbury]] and [[Assabet River|Assabet]] rivers forms the [[Concord River]].

The area that became the town of Concord was originally known as '''Musketaquid''', an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for "grassy plain." Concord was established in 1635 by a handful of English settlers; by 1775, the population had grown to 1,400.<ref name="concord_pop">{{cite web| url =http://historyofmassachusetts.org/concord-massachusetts-history/| title =History of Concord, Massachusetts| publisher =historyofmassachusetts.org| accessdate =October 16, 2018}}</ref> As dissension between colonists in North America and the British crown intensified, 700 troops were sent to confiscate militia ordnance stored at Concord on April 19, 1775.<ref>Fischer, p. 85</ref><ref name="Chidsey6">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 6. This is the total size of Smith's force.</ref> The ensuing conflict, the [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]], was the incident ([[the shot heard round the world]]) that triggered the [[American Revolutionary War]].

A rich literary community developed in Concord during the mid-19th century, centered around [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. Emerson's circle included [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Louisa May Alcott]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Major works written in Concord during this period include Alcott's novel ''[[Little Women]]'', Emerson's essay ''[[Self-Reliance]]'', and Thoreau's ''[[Walden]]'' and ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]''. In this era, the now-ubiquitous [[Concord grape]] was developed in Concord by [[Ephraim Wales Bull]].

In the 20th century, Concord developed into an affluent Boston suburb and tourist destination, drawing visitors to the [[Old North Bridge]], [[Orchard House]] and [[Walden Pond]]. The town retains its literary culture and is home to notable authors, including [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]], [[Alan Lightman]] and [[Gregory Maguire]]. Concord is also notable for its progressive and environmentalist politics, becoming in 2012 the first community in the United States to ban single-serving [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles.

===Battle of Lexington and Concord===
{{main|Battles of Lexington and Concord}}
The [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]] was the first conflict in the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-american-revolution-begins |title=The American Revolution begins |access-date=21 June 2018 |work=[[History.com]] |publisher=[[A&E Television Networks, LLC.]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324020541/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-american-revolution-begins |archive-date=24 March 2018}}</ref> On April 19, 1775, a force of [[British Army]] [[Regular army|regulars]] marched from [[Boston]] to Concord to capture a cache of arms that was reportedly stored in the town. Forewarned by [[Samuel Prescott]] (who had received the news from [[Paul Revere]]), the colonists mustered in opposition. Following an early-morning skirmish at [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], where the first shots of the battle were fired, the British expedition under the command of [[Francis Smith (British Army officer)|Lt. Col. Francis Smith]] advanced to Concord. There, colonists from Concord and surrounding towns (notably a highly drilled company from [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]] led by [[Isaac Davis (soldier)|Isaac Davis]]) [[Battle of Concord#The North Bridge|repulsed a British detachment]] at the [[Old North Bridge]] and forced the British troops to retreat.<ref name="LOC">{{cite web| url =http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/apr19.html| title =Today In History: April 19th| publisher =The Library of Congress| accessdate =April 3, 2007| url-status =live| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070302164826/http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/apr19.html| archive-date =March 2, 2007}}</ref> Subsequently, militia arriving from across the region [[Battles of Lexington and Concord#Return march|harried the British troops]] on their return to Boston, culminating in the [[Siege of Boston]] and the outbreak of the war.

The 20th-century composer [[Charles Ives]] wrote his ''[[Concord Sonata]]'' (c. 1904-15) as a series of impressionistic portraits of literary figures associated with the town.

Parker]], and [[Gregory Maguire]].

===Concord grape===
In 1849, [[Ephraim Bull]] developed the now-ubiquitous [[Concord grape]] at his home on Lexington Road, where the original vine still grows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/1988-48-4--he-sowed-others-reaped-ephraim-wales-bull-and-the-origins-of-the-concord-grape.pdf |title="He Sowed; Others Reaped": Ephraim Wales Bull and the Origins of the 'Concord' Grape |last=Schofield |first=Edmund A. |year=1988 |format=PDF |pages=4–15}}</ref> [[Welch's]], the first company to sell grape juice, maintains a headquarters in Concord.<ref name="Welch">{{cite web| url =http://www.welchs.com| title =All About Welch's: General Company Information| publisher =Welchs.com| accessdate =March 28, 2017| url-status =live| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170405211550/http://welchs.com/| archive-date =April 5, 2017}}</ref> The Boston-born Bull developed the Concord grape by experimenting with seeds from some of the native species. On his farm outside Concord, down the road from the Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne and Alcott homesteads, he planted some 22,000 seedlings before producing the ideal grape. Early ripening, to escape the killing northern frosts, but with a rich, full-bodied flavor, the hardy Concord grape thrives where European cuttings had failed to survive. In 1853, Bull felt ready to put the first bunches of Concord grapes before the public and won a prize at the Boston Horticultural Society Exhibition. From these early arbors, the fame of Bull's ("the father of the Concord grape") Concord grape spread worldwide, bringing him up to $1,000 a cutting, but he died a relatively poor man. The inscription on his tombstone reads, "He sowed—others reaped."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.concordgrape.org/bodyhistory.html |title=The History |year=2014 |access-date=21 June 2018 |work=Concord Grape Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621043045/https://www.concordgrape.org/bodyhistory.html |archive-date=21 June 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Plastic bottle ban===
On September 5, 2012, Concord became the first community in the United States to approve a ban of the sale of water in single-serving plastic bottles.

Resident Jean Hill, who led the initial fight for the ban, said, "I really feel at the age of 86 that I've really accomplished something." Town Moderator Eric Van Loon didn't even bother taking an official tally because opposition to repeal was so overwhelming. It appeared that upwards of 80 to 90 percent of the 1,127 voters in attendance raised their ballots against the repeal measure. The issue has been bubbling in Concord for several years. In 2010, a town meeting-approved ban, which wasn't written as a bylaw, was rejected by the state attorney general's office. In 2011, a new version of the ban narrowly failed at town meeting by a vote of 265 to 272. The ban on selling water in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles of one liter or less passed in 2012 by a vote of 403 to 364, and a repeal effort in April failed by a vote of 621 to 687.
