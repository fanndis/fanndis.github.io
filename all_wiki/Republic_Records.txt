'''Republic Records''' is an American [[record label]] owned by [[Universal Music Group]] (UMG). It was founded by [[Avery Lipman]] and [[Monte Lipman]] as an independent label in 1995, and was acquired by UMG in 2000. Republic was initially an imprint of the [[Universal Motown Records|Universal/Motown Records Group]], and was renamed '''Universal Republic Records''' after a reorganization in 2006 before reverting to its original name in 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/universal-signs-new-agreement-republics-418506|title=Universal Signs New Agreement With Republic's Monte and Avery Lipman|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ0EAAAAMBAJ&q=republic+records++acquired+by+universal+music+group+2000+lipman&pg=PA12|title=Lipman to head up Universal Records|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|date=January 15, 2000|work=Billboard|page=12|access-date=February 21, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cRIEAAAAMBAJ&q=Universal+Republic+Motown+2006&pg=PA72|title=Stop in the Name of Shiny Toy Guns|last=Mitchell|first=Gayle|date=February 10, 2007|work=Billboard|page=72|access-date=February 21, 2018}}</ref>

==History==

=== Foundation and Universal Records: 1995–2005 ===
According to Avery Lipman, he and his brother Monte conceived Republic Records at the kitchen table in their apartment:

<blockquote>My brother and I had been working at record companies. He was in between jobs and we started putting records out as a hobby. We had a grassroot approach to the business. The first record we put out happened to work really well. That was the Bloodhound Gang.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Avery_Lipman_Interview.html |title=Interview with Avery Lipman |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=7 Aug 2006 |accessdate=23 Nov 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

Republic Records was formed in 1995 as a subsidiary of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]'s [[Geffen Records]], but soon after its foundation, the distribution changed to the newly-established [[Universal Records (1995)|Universal Records]].<ref name="Billboard1998">{{Cite web|last=Rosen |first=Craig |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rg0EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22avery+lipman%22&pg=PA12|title=Lipmans' Republic Label Signs With Universal For Distribution|date=17 January 1998|publisher=|work=Billboard|access-date=6 May 2020}}</ref> In January 2000, it was announced that the Universal Music Group acquired the Lipman brothers' Republic Records as a wholly owned [[subsidiary]].

=== Universal Republic Records: 2006–12 ===
In 2006, corporate restructuring saw the formation of Universal Republic Records through a merger between the two labels.<ref name="La06">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/192618949/?terms=%22universal%2Brepublic%22|title=Universal Music Label to Be Split Into Two|date=24 February 2006|publisher=|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=6 May 2020}}</ref> Monte Lipman became the president and CEO of the restructured label while Avery Lipman served as co-president and COO.<ref name="THR2008">{{Cite web|last=Walsh |first=Chris M. |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/uni-republic-taps-lipman-president-101991|title=Uni Republic taps Lipman co-president|date=8 January 2008|publisher=|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=6 May 2020}}</ref> That same year, [[Gary Spangler]] joined the label as Vice President of Crossover Promotion, later becoming the Executive Vice President of Promotion.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Universal Republic Promotes, Restructures Promo Staff|url=https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/26873/universal-republic-promotes-restructures-promo-sta|access-date=2020-07-28|website=All Access|language=en}}</ref> Other changes were made at the label's parent, Universal Motown Republic Group, during the summer of 2011.

In 2020, Republic Records partnered up with [[JYP Entertainment]] for the Korean Girl Group [[Twice (group)|TWICE]] as the group's first American label and distributor. [[Twice (group)|TWICE]] will be first artist from [[JYP Entertainment]] to be powered under the alliance. [[Twice (group)|TWICE's]] signing represents a diversifying market for K-pop in America. <ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-02-24|title=JYP Entertainment & Republic Records Enter Strategic Partnership For Girl Group Twice: Exclusive|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/record-labels/8551703/jyp-entertainment-republic-records-strategic-parntership-twice|access-date=2020-07-27|website=Billboard}}</ref>

In October 2020, an investigation made by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor Elias Leight was published by the magazine. Among 2,500 text messages obtained by the magazine, several suggested a link between [[payola|airplay and record label payments]], including a message made by independent radio promoter Steve Zap to one station in August 2019 saying "Republic sweating me already", asking to put one of their artists on "super power" rotation. Zap's texts refer to "adjusting airplay to help labels achieve chart goals in key weeks". A spokesperson for Universal Music Group, corporation which owns Republic Records, stated that "all third-party radio promotion contractors annually submit [[affidavit]]s to UMG certifying their compliance with strict rules and regulations, including prohibitions that expressly forbid providing anything of value to a radio station or a radio station employee in exchange for increased airtime".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/pay-for-play-radio-texts-1067691/|title=Pay-for-Play Was Banned From Radio — But Texts Reveal It May Still Be Thriving|work=Rolling Stone|author=Leight, Elias}}</ref>
