==History==
Established as a Chinese-language weekly publication in 1993, an English-language version was launched on 20 April 2009 as part of a Chinese government campaign to compete with overseas media.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Huang|first=C.|url=http://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/view/rmit:39966|title=Conservative popular journalism, public diplomacy, and the search for an alternative Chinese modernity: Revisiting the global times|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-4724-4398-4|language=en|access-date=9 May 2020|archive-date=23 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823194734/http://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/view/rmit:39966|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Canaves|first=Sky|date=2009-06-04|title=Global Times Breaches China's Official Media Silence on Tiananmen|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2009/06/04/global-times-breaches-chinas-official-media-silence-on-tiananmen/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200410210314/https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2009/06/04/global-times-breaches-chinas-official-media-silence-on-tiananmen/|archive-date=10 April 2020|access-date=2020-08-23|website=The Wall Street Journal|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":2" />

==Controversies==
=== Astroturfing ===
According to Richard Burger, a former editor at ''Global Times'', in the wake of the arrest of [[Ai Weiwei]], the Chinese staff of the Global Times were ordered to conduct an "[[astroturfing]]" campaign against Ai Weiwei in favour of the Chinese Communist Party's criticism of Ai as a "maverick".<ref>{{cite web|date=16 April 2011|title=Foreign Media Insider Exposes Global Times's Managing Editor's Smearing Of Ai Weiwei|url=https://hk.appledaily.com/china/20110416/OL7YJ4QUWUDTIZ4E222FRZ7TVU/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823205545/https://hk.appledaily.com/china/20110416/OL7YJ4QUWUDTIZ4E222FRZ7TVU/|archive-date=23 August 2020|access-date=August 23, 2020|work=Apple Daily|language=zh}}</ref>

=== China ===
In May 2016, the ''Global Times'' was criticized by the [[Cyberspace Administration of China]] that it was "fabricating" news on the US, the South China Sea, North Korea, and Hong Kong, and "disturbing" the order of the cyberspace.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20160512-%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%AE%E7%BD%91%E4%BF%A1%E5%8A%9E%E6%89%B9%E3%80%8A%E7%8E%AF%E7%90%83%E6%97%B6%E6%8A%A5%E3%80%8B%E3%80%81%E7%8E%AF%E7%90%83%E7%BD%91%E2%80%9C%E7%82%92%E4%BD%9C%E2%80%9D%E6%95%8F%E6%84%9F%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6|title=中央网信办批《环球时报》、环球网"炒作"敏感事件|access-date=20 February 2020|language=zh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220225051/http://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20160512-%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%AE%E7%BD%91%E4%BF%A1%E5%8A%9E%E6%89%B9%E3%80%8A%E7%8E%AF%E7%90%83%E6%97%B6%E6%8A%A5%E3%80%8B%E3%80%81%E7%8E%AF%E7%90%83%E7%BD%91%E2%80%9C%E7%82%92%E4%BD%9C%E2%80%9D%E6%95%8F%E6%84%9F%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6|archive-date=20 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>
