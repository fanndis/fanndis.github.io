==Sponsorships and promotions==
Kraft is an official partner and sponsor of both [[Major League Soccer]] and the [[National Hockey League]]. ''[[Kraft Hockeyville]]'' began in 2006 as a Canadian reality television series developed by [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC/SRC]] Sports and sponsored by Kraft Foods in which communities across Canada compete to demonstrate their commitment to the sport of ice hockey. The contest revolves around a central theme of community spirit. The winning community gets a cash prize dedicated to upgrading their local home arena, as well as the opportunity to host an NHL preseason game. In 2007, it was then relegated to segments aired during ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''. In 2015, ''Kraft Hockeyville'' was expanded into the United States, with a separate competition for communities there.

From 2002 to 2014, Kraft sponsored the [[ANA Inspiration|Kraft Nabisco Championship]], one of the four [[Women's major golf championships|"majors"]] on the [[LPGA]] tour. The company also sponsored the [[Fight Hunger Bowl|Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl]], a post-season [[college football]] [[bowl game]], from 2010 to 2012.

In 2011, Kraft has released an [[App Store (iOS)|iPad app]] called "Big Fork Little Fork" which, in addition to games and other distractions, has information regarding how to use Kraft Foods in nutritious ways.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kraftrecipes.com/media/bflf.aspx|title=Big Fork Little Fork|publisher=KraftRecipes.Com|accessdate=January 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/04/brand-open-api-developers/ |title=Why Every Brand Needs an Open API for Developers |last1=Kleinberg |first1=Adam |date=January 4, 2011 |journal=[[Mashable]] |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}</ref>
