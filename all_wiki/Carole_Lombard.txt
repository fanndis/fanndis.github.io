'''Carole Lombard''' (born '''Jane Alice Peters'''; October 6, 1908&nbsp;– January 16, 1942) was an American actress, particularly noted for her energetic, often off-beat roles in [[Screwball comedy|screwball comedies]]. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Lombard 23rd on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema]].

Lombard was born into a wealthy family in [[Fort Wayne]], Indiana, but was raised in [[Los Angeles]] by her single mother. At 12, she was recruited by director [[Allan Dwan]] and made her screen debut in ''A Perfect Crime'' (1921). Eager to become an actress, she signed a contract with the [[Fox Film Corporation]] at age 16, but mainly played [[bit part]]s. She was dropped by Fox just before her 18th birthday after a shattered windshield from a car accident left a scar on her face. Lombard appeared in fifteen short comedies for [[Mack Sennett]] between 1927 and 1929, and then began appearing in feature films such as ''[[High Voltage (1929 film)|High Voltage]]'' (1929) and  ''[[The Racketeer]]'' (1929). After a successful appearance in ''[[The Arizona Kid (1930 film)|The Arizona Kid]]'' (1930), she was signed to a contract with [[Paramount Pictures]].

Paramount quickly began casting Lombard as a leading lady, primarily in [[drama film]]s. Her profile increased when she married [[William Powell]] in 1931, but the couple divorced amicably after two years. A turning point in Lombard's career came when she starred in [[Howard Hawks]]'s pioneering screwball comedy ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' (1934). The actress found her niche in this genre, and continued to appear in films such as ''[[Hands Across the Table]]'' (1935) (forming a popular partnership with [[Fred MacMurray]]), ''[[My Man Godfrey]]'' (1936), for which she was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and ''[[Nothing Sacred (film)|Nothing Sacred]]'' (1937). At this time, Lombard married "The King of Hollywood", [[Clark Gable]], and the [[supercouple]] gained much attention from the media. Keen to win an Oscar, Lombard began to move towards more serious roles at the end of the decade. Unsuccessful in this aim, she returned to comedy in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941) and [[Ernst Lubitsch]]'s ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' (1942), her final film role.

Lombard's career was cut short when she died at the age of 33 aboard [[TWA Flight 3]], which crashed on [[Potosi Mountain (Nevada)|Mount Potosi, Nevada]], while returning from a [[Liberty bond|war bond]] tour. Today, she is remembered as one of the definitive actresses of the screwball comedy genre and American comedy, and as an icon of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|American cinema]].

==Early life==

===Childhood, family and education===
Lombard was born in [[Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]], on October 6, 1908 at 704 Rockhill Street.<ref>Indiana, Birth Certificates, 1907–1940</ref> Christened with the name Jane Alice Peters, she was the third child and only daughter of Frederic Christian Peters (1875–1935) and Elizabeth Jayne "Bessie" (Knight) Peters (1876–1942). Her two older brothers, to each of whom she was close, both growing up and in adulthood, were Frederic Charles (1902–1979) and John Stuart (1906–1956).{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=19}} Lombard's parents both descended from wealthy families and her early years were lived in comfort, with the biographer Robert Matzen calling it her "[[silver spoon]] period".{{sfnm|1a1=Matzen 1988|1p=1|2a1=Gehring 2003|2p=19}} The marriage between her parents was strained, however,{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=23}} and in October 1914, her mother took the children and moved to Los Angeles.{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=16}} Although the couple did not divorce, the separation was permanent.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=23}} Her father's continued financial support allowed the family to live without worry, if not with the same affluence they had enjoyed in Indiana, and they settled into an apartment near [[Venice Boulevard]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=25}}

[[File:A perfect crime 1921.jpg|thumb|left|upright|At age 12, Lombard had a small role in the film ''A Perfect Crime'' (1921). Here with [[Monte Blue]].]]

Described by her biographer Wes Gehring as "a free-spirited [[tomboy]]", the young Lombard was passionately involved in sports and enjoyed watching movies.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=20}} At [[Virgil Middle School|Virgil Junior High School]], she participated in tennis, volleyball, and swimming, and won trophies for her achievements in athletics.{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=16}} At the age of 12, this hobby unexpectedly landed Lombard her first screen role. While playing baseball with friends, she caught the attention of the film director [[Allan Dwan]], who later recalled seeing "a cute-looking little tomboy&nbsp;... out there knocking the hell out of the other kids, playing better baseball than they were. And I needed someone of her type for this picture."{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=27–28}} With the encouragement of her mother, Lombard happily took a small role in the melodrama ''[[A Perfect Crime]]'' (1921). She was on set for two days,{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=27–28}} playing the sister of [[Monte Blue]].{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=17}} Dwan later commented, "She ate it up".{{sfn|Matzen 1988|p=5}}

==Career==

===First roles and Fox contract (1921–26)===

''A Perfect Crime'' was not widely distributed, but the brief experience spurred Lombard and her mother to look for more film work. The teenager attended several auditions, but none was successful.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=29}} While appearing as the queen of [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]]'s [[May Day]] Carnival at the age of 15, she was scouted by an employee of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and offered a screen test to appear in his film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925). Lombard was not given the role, but it raised Hollywood's awareness of the aspiring actress.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=39–41}} Her test was seen by the [[Vitagraph Film Company]], which expressed an interest in signing her to a contract. Although this did not materialize, the condition that she adopt a new first name ("Jane" was considered too dull) lasted with Lombard throughout her career. She selected the name "Carol" after a girl with whom she played tennis in middle school.{{sfn|Matzen 1988|p=6}}

In October 1924, shortly after these disappointments, 16-year-old Lombard was signed to a contract with the [[Fox Film Corporation]]. Lombard's mother contacted [[Louella Parsons]], the gossip columnist, who then got her a screen test.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=44–45}} According to the biographer Larry Swindell, Lombard's beauty convinced [[Winfield Sheehan]], head of the studio, to sign her to a $75-per-week contract.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=40}} The teenager abandoned her schooling to embark on this new career.{{sfn|Matzen 1988|p=6}} Fox was happy to use the name Carol, but unlike Vitagraph, disliked her surname. From this point, she became "Carol Lombard", the new name taken from a family friend.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=46}}

The majority of Lombard's appearances with Fox were [[bit part]]s{{sfn|Matzen 1988|p=6}} in low-budget [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] and adventure films. She later commented on her dissatisfaction with these roles: "All I had to do was simper prettily at the hero and scream with terror when he battled with the villain."{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=46}} She fully enjoyed the other aspects of film work, however, such as photo shoots, costume fittings, and socializing with actors on the studio set. Lombard embraced the [[flapper]] lifestyle and became a regular at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Coconut Grove]] nightclub, where she won several [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] dance competitions.{{sfnm|1a1=Matzen 1988|1p=6|2a1=Gehring 2003|2p=47}}

In March 1925, Fox gave Lombard a leading role in the drama ''[[Marriage in Transit]]'', opposite [[Edmund Lowe]]. Her performance was well received, with a reviewer for ''[[Motion Picture News]]'' writing that she displayed "good poise and considerable charm."{{sfn|Ott 1972|pp=18, 49}} Despite this, the studio heads were unconvinced that Lombard was leading lady material, and her one-year contract was not renewed.{{sfnm|1a1=Matzen 1988|1p=6|2a1=Ott 1972|2p=19}} Gehring has suggested that a facial scar she obtained in an automobile accident was a factor in this decision, however this is not the case, as the accident occurred nearly two years later on September 9th, 1927.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kiriakou |first1=Olympia |title=Becoming Carole Lombard: Stardom, Comedy, and Legacy |date=2020 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=9781501350733 |pages=18 |access-date=3 December 2020}}</ref> 

According to historian Olympia Kiriakou, on the night of the accident, Lombard was out on a date with a young man named Harry Cooper. As they were driving down Santa Monica Boulevard, Cooper crashed into another car; the windshield shattered and shards of glass cut "Lombard’s face from her nose and across her left cheek to her eye."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kiriakou |first1=Olympia |title=Becoming Carole Lombard: Stardom, Comedy, and Legacy |date=2020 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=9781501350733 |pages=18}}</ref> Lombard underwent reconstructive surgery, and faced a long recovery period. For the remainder of her career, Lombard learned to hide the mark with make-up and careful lighting.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=48–50}} At the time of the accident, Lombard was already under contract with Mack Sennett. In October 1927 Lombard and her mother, Bess, sued Cooper for $35,000 in damages, citing in the lawsuit that "where she formerly was able to earn a salary of $300 monthly as a Sennett girl, she is now unable to obtain employment of any kind." The lawsuit was settled out of court, and Lombard received $3000.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kiriakou |first1=Olympia |title=Becoming Carole Lombard: Stardom, Comedy, and Legacy |date=2020 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=9781501350733 |pages=19}}</ref>  Although Lombard feared that the accident would put an end to her career, Sennett pledged to help her get back on her feet. He gave her "lucrative film roles and ample publicity," including a nickname "Carole of the Curves." Kiriakou explains that "the nickname simultaneously drew audiences’ focus away from her facial scars and worked harmoniously with the physicality and female sensuality that were emblematic of Lombard’s performances" in Sennett's films.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kiriakou |first1=Olympia |title=Becoming Carole Lombard: Stardom, Comedy, and Legacy |date=2020 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=9781501350733 |pages=19}}</ref>

===Breakthrough and early success (1927–29)===

Although Lombard initially had reservations about performing in [[slapstick]] comedies, the actress joined his company as one of the "[[Sennett Bathing Beauties#Sennett Bathing Beauties|Sennett Bathing Beauties]]".{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=53–54}} She appeared in 18 short films between September 1927 and March 1929,{{sfn|Ott 1972|pp=55–60}} and greatly enjoyed her time at the studio.{{sfnm|1a1=Ott 1972|1p=20|2a1=Gehring 2003|2p=53}} It gave Lombard her first experiences in comedy and provided valuable training for her future work in the genre.{{sfnm|1a1=Gehring 2003|1pp=57–58|2a1=Ott 1972|2p=20}} In 1940, she called her Sennett years "the turning point of [my] acting career."{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=59}}

Sennett's productions were distributed by [[Pathé Exchange]], and the company began casting Lombard in feature films. She had prominent roles in ''[[Show Folks]]'' and ''[[Ned McCobb's Daughter]]'' (both 1928),{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=61}} where reviewers observed that she made a "good impression" and was "worth watching".{{sfn|Ott 1972|pp=65–66}} The following year, Pathé elevated Lombard from a supporting player to a leading lady.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=65}} Her success in [[Raoul Walsh]]'s picture ''[[Me, Gangster]]'' (also 1928), opposite [[June Collyer]] and [[Don Terry]] on his film debut, finally eased the pressure her family had been putting on her to succeed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/silverscreen04unse_0#page/n27/mode/2up|title=Carole Gets Her Own Way|work=Silver Screen|date=May–October 1934|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}</ref> In [[Howard Higgin]]'s ''[[High Voltage (1929 film)|High Voltage]]'' (1929), her first [[sound film|talking picture]], she played a criminal in the custody of a deputy sheriff, both of whom are among bus passengers stranded in deep snow.{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=22}}  Her next film, the comedy ''[[Big News (film)|Big News]]'' (1929), cast her opposite [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] and was a critical and commercial success.{{sfnm|1a1=Gehring 2003|1p=65|2a1=Ott 1972|2p=22}} Lombard was reunited with Armstrong for the crime drama ''[[The Racketeer]]'', released in late 1929. The review in ''[[Film Daily]]'' wrote, "Carol Lombard proves a real surprise, and does her best work to date. In fact, this is the first opportunity she has had to prove that she has the stuff to go over."{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=72}}

===Paramount contract and first marriage (1930–33)===
[[File:Safety in Numbers promo crop.jpg|thumb|Lombard (left) with [[Josephine Dunn]] in ''[[Safety in Numbers (1930 film)|Safety in Numbers]]'' (1930)]]
Lombard returned to Fox for a one-off role in the western ''[[The Arizona Kid (1930 film)|The Arizona Kid]]'' (1930). It was a big release for the studio, starring the popular actor [[Warner Baxter]], in which Lombard received third billing.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=68–69}} Following the success of the film, Paramount Pictures recruited Lombard and signed her to a $350-per-week contract, gradually increasing to $3,500 per week by 1936.{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=23}} They cast her in the [[Buddy Rogers (actor)|Buddy Rogers]] comedy ''[[Safety in Numbers (1930 film)|Safety in Numbers]]'' (also 1930), and one critic observed of her work, "Lombard proves [to be] an ace comedienne."{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=77}} For her second assignment, ''[[Fast and Loose (1930 film)|Fast and Loose]]'' (also 1930) with [[Miriam Hopkins]], Paramount mistakenly credited the actress as "Carole Lombard". She decided she liked this spelling and it became her permanent screen name.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=78–79}}{{refn|In her lifetime, the media reported that Lombard added the extra "e" to Carol at the advice of a [[numerologist]].{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=78–79}} She denied this to Garson Kanin, saying, "That's a lot of bunk."{{sfn|Kanin 1974|p=59}} Some of the Mack Sennett shorts had already used the spelling "Carole", but this is thought to have been an accident.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=78–79}} Her name was not consistently billed and reported with this spelling until 1930.{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=46}} She legally changed her name to "Carole Lombard" in 1936.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=205}}|group=note}}

Lombard appeared in five films released during 1931, beginning with the [[Frank Tuttle]] comedy ''[[It Pays to Advertise (1931 film)|It Pays to Advertise]]''. Her next two films, ''[[Man of the World (film)|Man of the World]]'' and ''[[Ladies' Man (1931 film)|Ladies Man]]'', both featured [[William Powell]], Paramount's top male star.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=83}} Lombard had been a fan of the actor before they met, attracted to his good looks and debonair screen persona,{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=85}} and they were soon in a relationship.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=83}} The differences between the pair have been noted by biographers: she was 22, carefree, and famously foul-mouthed, while he was 38, intellectual, and sophisticated.{{sfnm|1a1=Gehring 2003|1p=83|2a1=Matzen 1988|2p=11}} Despite their disparate personalities, Lombard married Powell on June 6, 1931, at her Beverly Hills home.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=87}} Talking to the media, she argued for the benefits of "love between two people who are diametrically different", claiming that their relationship allowed for a "perfect see-saw love".{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=85}}
[[File:My Man Godfrey promo still 2.jpg|thumb|left|With [[William Powell]], her husband from June 1931 to August 1933]]
The marriage to Powell increased Lombard's fame,{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=87}} while she continued to please critics with her work in ''[[Up Pops the Devil]]'' and ''[[I Take This Woman (1931 film)|I Take this Woman]]'' (both 1931).{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=24}} In reviews for the latter film, which co-starred [[Gary Cooper]], several critics predicted that Lombard was set to become a major star.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=90–91}} She went on to appear in five films throughout 1932. ''[[No One Man]]'' and ''[[Sinners in the Sun]]'' were not successful,{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=91}} but [[Edward Buzzell]]'s romantic picture ''[[Virtue (film)|Virtue]]'' was well received.{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=25}} After featuring in the drama ''[[No More Orchids]]'', Lombard was cast as the wife of a con artist in ''[[No Man of Her Own (1932 film)|No Man of Her Own]]''.{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=25}} Her co-star for the picture was [[Clark Gable]], who was rapidly becoming one of Hollywood's top stars.{{sfnm|1a1=Swindell 1975|1p=197|2a1=Gehring 2003|2p=98}} The film was a critical and commercial success, and Wes Gehring writes that it was "arguably Lombard's finest film appearance" to that point.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=97–100; 102 (for quote)}} It was the only picture that Gable and Lombard, future husband and wife, made together. There was no romantic interest at this time, however, as she recounted to [[Garson Kanin]]: "[we] did all kinds of hot love scenes&nbsp;... and I never got any kind of tremble out of him at all".{{sfn|Kanin 1974|p=61}}{{refn|At the time, Lombard was married to Powell (and told Kanin she was "on my ear about a different number at that time"){{sfn|Kanin 1974|p=61}} while Gable was married to Rhea Langham and having an affair with [[Joan Crawford]].{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=101}}|group=note}}

In August 1933, Lombard and Powell divorced after 26 months of marriage, although they remained very good friends until the end of Lombard's life. At the time, she blamed it on their careers,{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=92–93}} but in a 1936 interview, she admitted that this "had little to do with the divorce. We were just two completely incompatible people".{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=24}} She appeared in five films that year, beginning with the drama ''[[From Hell to Heaven]]'' and continuing with ''[[Supernatural (film)|Supernatural]]'', her only horror vehicle. After a small role in ''[[The Eagle and the Hawk (1933 film)|The Eagle and the Hawk]]'', a war film starring [[Fredric March]] and [[Cary Grant]], she starred in two melodramas: ''[[Brief Moment]]'', which critics enjoyed, and ''[[White Woman]]'', where she was paired with [[Charles Laughton]].{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=102; 105}} “We would have married,” said Carole Lombard during her interview with magazine writer Sonia Lee for Movie Screen Magazine in 1934 about her relationship with [[Russ Columbo]], the famous singer killed in a tragic accident whose movie and radio career she had been guiding.

The year 1934 marked a high point in Lombard's career.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=110}} She began with [[Wesley Ruggles]]'s musical drama ''[[Bolero (1934 film)|Bolero]]'', where [[George Raft]] and she showcased their dancing skills in an extravagantly staged performance to [[Maurice Ravel]]'s "[[Boléro]]".{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=26}} Before filming began, she was offered the lead female role in ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', but turned it down because of scheduling conflicts with this production.{{sfn|MacBride 2000|p=303}}{{refn|''It Happened One Night''&nbsp; went on to be a major success and won five [[Academy Award]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for [[Claudette Colbert]] in the role that Lombard would have played.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=103}}|group=note}} ''Bolero'' was favorably received, while her next film, the musical comedy ''[[We're Not Dressing]]'' with [[Bing Crosby]], was a box-office hit.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=110}}

Lombard was then recruited by the director [[Howard Hawks]], a second cousin,{{sfn|Hawks 2005|p=147}} to star in his [[screwball comedy]] film ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' {{sfnm|1a1=Ott 1972|1p=26|2a1=Gehring 2003|2p=111}} which proved a watershed in her career and made her a major star.{{sfnm|1a1=Gehring 2003|1pp=121, 123|2a1=Ott 1972|2p=28}} Hawks had seen the actress inebriated at a party, where he found her to be "hilarious and uninhibited and just what the part needed",{{sfn|Bogdanovich 2012|p=466}} and she was cast opposite [[John Barrymore]].{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=118}} In ''Twentieth Century'', Lombard plays an actress who is pursued by her former mentor, a flamboyant Broadway [[impresario]]. Hawks and Barrymore were unimpressed with her work in rehearsals, finding that she was "acting" too hard and giving a stiff performance. The director encouraged Lombard to relax, be herself, and act on her instincts.{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=27}}{{refn|Hawks recalled, "She acted like a schoolgirl&nbsp;... and she was stiff, she would try to imagine a character and then act according to her imaginings instead of being herself." When he felt that Lombard had overcome this in a scene, he said to Barrymore, "you've just seen a girl that's probably going to be a big star, and if we can just keep her from acting, we'll have a hell of a picture."{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=27}}|group=note}} She responded well to this tutoring, and reviews for the film commented on her unexpectedly "fiery talent"—"a Lombard like no Lombard you've ever seen".{{sfn|Ott 1972|pp=120–121}} The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''' critic felt that she was "entirely different" from her formerly cool, "calculated" persona, adding, "she vibrates with life and passion, abandon and diablerie".{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=117}}

The next films in which Lombard appeared were [[Henry Hathaway]]'s ''[[Now and Forever (1934 film)|Now and Forever]]'' (1934), featuring Gary Cooper and the new child star [[Shirley Temple]], and ''[[Lady by Choice]]'' (1934), which was a critical and commercial success. ''[[The Gay Bride]]'' (1934) placed her opposite [[Chester Morris]] in a gangster comedy, but this outing was panned by critics.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=122–123}} After reuniting with George Raft for another dance picture, ''[[Rumba (1935 film)|Rumba]]'' (1935), Lombard was given the opportunity to repeat the screwball success of ''Twentieth Century''.{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=28}} In  [[Mitchell Leisen]]'s ''[[Hands Across the Table]]'' (1935), she portrays a manicurist in search of a rich husband, played by [[Fred MacMurray]]. Critics praised the film, and ''Photoplay'''s reviewer stated that Lombard had reaffirmed her talent for the genre.{{sfnm|1a1=Ott 1972|1p=133|2a1=Gehring 2003|2p=127}} It is remembered as one of her best films,{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=28}} and the pairing of Lombard and MacMurray proved so successful that they made three more pictures together.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=127}}

===Continued success (1936–37)===

[[File:Clip from My Man Godfrey.ogg|thumb|left|thumbtime=0:32|Clip from ''[[My Man Godfrey]]'' (1936), which earned Lombard an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]]]

Lombard's first film of 1936 was ''[[Love Before Breakfast]]'', described by Gehring as "''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', screwball style".{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=135}} In [[William K. Howard]]'s ''[[The Princess Comes Across]]'', her second comedy with MacMurray, she played a budding actress who wins a film contract by masquerading as a Swedish princess. The performance was considered a satire of [[Greta Garbo]], and was widely praised by critics.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=136–137}} Lombard's success continued as she was recruited by [[Universal Studios]] to star in the screwball comedy ''[[My Man Godfrey]]'' (1936). William Powell, who was playing the eponymous Godfrey, insisted on her being cast as the female lead; despite their divorce, the pair remained friendly and Powell felt she would be perfect in the role of Irene, a zany heiress who employs a "[[forgotten man]]" as the family butler.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=93–95, 132}} The film was directed by [[Gregory LaCava]], who knew Lombard personally and advised that she draw on her "eccentric nature" for the role.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=133, 137, 139}} She worked hard on the performance, particularly with finding the appropriate facial expressions for Irene.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=140}} ''My Man Godfrey'' was released to great acclaim and was a box office hit. It received six nominations at the [[9th Academy Awards]], including Lombard for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].{{refn|At the Academy Awards ceremony, Lombard was announced as the nominee with the second-highest number of votes. The award went to [[Luise Rainer]] for ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]''.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=168}}|group=note}} Biographers cite it as her finest performance, and Frederick Ott says it "clearly established [her] as a comedienne of the first rank."{{sfnm|1a1=Ott 1972|1p=29|2a1=Gehring 2003|2pp=140–142}}

By 1937, Lombard was one of Hollywood's most popular actresses,{{sfnm|1a1=Haver 1980|1p=214|2a1=Swindell 1975|2p=220}} and also the highest-paid star in Hollywood following the deal which [[Myron Selznick]] negotiated with Paramount that brought her $450,000, {{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=201}} more than five times the [[US President#Compensation|salary of the U.S. President]].{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=9}} As her salary was widely reported in the press, Lombard stated that 80 percent of her earnings went in taxes, but that she was happy to help improve her country.{{sfn|Haver 1980|p=214}} The comments earned her much positive publicity, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent her a personal letter of thanks.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=232}}

Her first release of the year was Leisen's ''[[Swing High, Swing Low (film)|Swing High, Swing Low]]'', a third pairing with MacMurray. The film focused on a romance between two cabaret performers, and was a critical and commercial success.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=153}} It had been primarily a drama, with occasional moments of comedy,{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=154–156}} but for her next project, ''[[Nothing Sacred (film)|Nothing Sacred]]'', Lombard returned to the screwball genre.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=158}} Producer [[David O. Selznick]], impressed by her work in ''My Man Godfrey'', was eager to make a comedy with the actress and hired [[Ben Hecht]] to write an original screenplay for her.{{sfn|Haver 1980|pp=214–215}} ''Nothing Sacred'', directed by [[William Wellman]] and co-starring Fredric March, satirized the journalism industry and "the gullible urban masses". Lombard portrayed a small-town girl who pretends to be dying and finds her story exploited by a New York reporter.{{sfn|Ott 1972|pp=30, 148–149}} Marking her only appearance in [[Technicolor]], the film was highly praised and was one of Lombard's personal favorites.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=154, 161–162}}

Lombard continued with screwball comedies, next starring in what Swindell calls one of her "wackiest" films, ''[[True Confession]]'' (1937).{{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=226}} She played a compulsive liar who wrongly confesses to murder. Lombard loved the script and was excited about the project, which reunited her with John Barrymore and was her final appearance with MacMurray. Her prediction that it "smacked of a surefire success" proved accurate, as critics responded positively and it was popular at the box office.{{sfnm|1a1=Gehring 2003|1pp=163–166|2a1=Swindell 1975|2pp=225, 228}}

===Dramatic efforts and second marriage (1938–40)===

[[File:Gable-Lombard-39.jpg|thumb|left|With [[Clark Gable]] after their honeymoon in 1939]]

''True Confession'' was the last film Lombard made on her Paramount contract, and she remained an independent performer for the rest of her career.{{sfn|Ott 1972|p=30}} Her next film was made at [[Warner Bros.]], where she played a famous actress in [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s ''[[Fools for Scandal]]'' (1938). The comedy met with scathing reviews and was a commercial failure, with Swindell calling it "one of the most horrendous flops of the thirties".{{sfnm|1a1=Swindell 1975|1p=237|2a1=Gehring 2003|2pp=174–175}}

''Fools for Scandal'' was the only film Lombard made in 1938. By this time, she was devoted to a relationship with Clark Gable.{{sfnm|1a1=Swindell 1975|1pp=236–237|2a1=Gehring 2003|2p=173}} Four years after their teaming on ''No Man of Her Own'', the pair had reunited at a Hollywood party and began a romance early in 1936.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|pp=191–194}} The media took great interest in their partnership and frequently questioned if they would wed.{{sfnm|1a1=Swindell 1975|1pp=200, 205|2a1=Gehring 2003|2p=168}} Gable was separated from his wife, Rhea Langham, but she did not want to grant him a divorce.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|pp=199, 213}} As his relationship with Lombard became serious, Langham eventually agreed to a settlement worth half a million dollars.{{refn|Gable had to give Langham $350,000 in cash plus additional property, leading to a total settlement worth more than half a million.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=238}} The expense of the divorce contributed to Gable's agreement to portray [[Rhett Butler]] in ''[[Gone With the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=180}}|group=note}} The divorce was finalized in March 1939, and Gable and Lombard [[elopement|eloped]] in [[Kingman, Arizona]], on March 29.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|p=184}} The couple, both lovers of the outdoors, bought a 20-acre ranch in [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino]], California, where they kept barnyard animals and enjoyed hunting trips.{{sfn|Ott 1972|pp=31–32}} Almost immediately, Lombard  wanted to start a family, but her attempts failed; after two miscarriages and numerous trips to fertility specialists, she was unable to have children.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=f0usSUISUUMC&pg=PA200&q=carole%20lombard%20miscarriage%20clark%20gable E.

[[File:Vigil in the Night advert.jpg|thumb|upright|Advertisement for ''[[Vigil in the Night]]'' (1940), which Lombard hoped would bring her an Oscar]]

While continuing with a slower work-rate, Lombard decided to move away from comedies and return to dramatic roles.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=175, 181}} She appeared in a second David O. Selznick production, ''[[Made for Each Other (1939 film)|Made for Each Other]]'' (1939), which paired her with [[James Stewart]] to play a couple facing domestic difficulties.{{sfn|Ott 1972|pp=158–159}} Reviews for the film were highly positive, and praised Lombard's dramatic effort; financially, it was a disappointment.{{sfnm|1a1=Swindell 1975|1p=246|2a1=Gehring 2003|2pp=181–183, 189|3a1=Ott 1972|3p=160}} Lombard's next appearance came opposite Cary Grant in the [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]] romance ''[[In Name Only]]'' (1939), a credit she personally negotiated with [[RKO Radio Pictures]] upon hearing of the script and Grant's involvement.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|pp=252–253}} The role mirrored her recent experiences, as she played a woman in love with a married man whose wife refuses to divorce. She was paid $150,000 for the film, continuing her status as one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, and it was a moderate success.{{sfnm|1a1=Gehring 2003|1pp=188–189|2a1=Swindell 1975|p=253}}

Lombard was eager to win an Academy Award, and selected her next project—from several possible scripts—with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|pp=258, 260}} ''[[Vigil in the Night]]'' (1940), directed by [[George Stevens]], featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre mood of the picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=261}} Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies,{{sfnm|1a1=Gehring 2003|1pp=190, 200|2a1=Swindell 1975|2pp=261, 271}} Lombard completed one more drama: ''[[They Knew What They Wanted (film)|They Knew What They Wanted]]'' (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was mildly successful.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=272}}

===Final roles (1941–42)===

[[File:Lombard in To Be or Not to Be 1.jpg|thumb|left|Lombard in her final role, ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' (1942)]]

Accepting that "my name doesn't sell tickets to serious pictures",{{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=274}} Lombard returned to comedy for the first time in three years to film ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941), about a couple who learns that their marriage is invalid, with [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]. Lombard was influential in bringing [[Alfred Hitchcock]], whom she knew through David O. Selznick, to direct one of his most atypical films.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=279}} It was a commercial success, as audiences were happy with what Swindell calls "the belated happy news&nbsp;... that Carole Lombard was a screwball once more."{{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=280}}

It was nearly a year before Lombard committed to another film, as she focused instead on her home and marriage.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|p=283}}{{refn|Rumors at this time stated that Gable and Lombard were experiencing marital difficulties; in 1941, they put their home up for sale, but soon took it off the market, which was taken as evidence that they had separated and then reconciled. Lombard was also eager to get pregnant, but had difficulty conceiving.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|pp=284–287}}|group=note}} Determined that her next film be "an unqualified smash hit", she was also careful in selecting a new project. Through her agent, Lombard heard of [[Ernst Lubitsch]]'s upcoming film: ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' (1942), a dark comedy that satirized the [[Nazi]] [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|takeover of Poland]].{{sfn|Swindell 1975|pp=290–291}} The actress had long wanted to work with Lubitsch, her favorite comedy director, and felt that the material—although controversial—was a worthy subject.{{sfn|Gehring 2003|pp=215–216}} Lombard accepted the role of actress Maria Tura, despite it being a smaller part than she was used to, and was given top billing over the film's lead, [[Jack Benny]]. Filming took place in the fall of 1941, and was reportedly one of the happiest experiences of Lombard's career.{{sfn|Swindell 1975|pp=290–291}}

==Death==
[[File:Carole Lombard in Indianapolis composite.jpg|thumb|right|Lombard in Indiana, January 1942, shortly before her death in a plane crash]]
When the U.S. entered World War II at the end of 1941, Lombard traveled to her home state of Indiana for a [[war bond]] rally with her mother, Bess Peters, and Clark Gable's press agent, Otto Winkler. Lombard raised more than $2 million in defense bonds in a single evening. Her party had initially been scheduled to return to Los Angeles by train, but Lombard was eager to reach home more quickly and wanted to travel by air. Her mother and Winkler were afraid of flying and insisted that the group follow their original travel plans. Lombard suggested that they flip a coin; they agreed, and Lombard won the toss.<ref name="classichollywoodbios">Kulzer, Dina-Marie. [http://www.classichollywoodbios.com/carolelombard.htm "Carole Lombard: Lovable Madcap."] ''Classic Hollywood Bios''.</ref>

In the early morning hours of January 16, 1942, Lombard, her mother and Winkler boarded a [[Trans World Airlines|Transcontinental and Western Air]] [[Douglas DC-3|Douglas DST]] (Douglas Sleeper Transport) aircraft to return to California.{{refn|The Douglas DST or Douglas Sleeper Transport was an airliner with either 24 passenger seats in daytime operation or fitted out with 16 sleeper bunks in the cabin.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QdsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA23 "Sleeping Car of the Air Has Sixteen Sleeping Berths"].

The cause of the crash was attributed to the flight crew's inability to properly navigate over the mountains surrounding Las Vegas. As a precaution against the possibility of enemy Japanese bomber aircraft coming into American airspace from the Pacific, safety beacons normally used to direct night flights had been turned off, leaving the pilot and crew of the TWA flight without visual warnings of the mountains in their flight path.{{sfn|Cohen 1991|p=347}}<ref name=clrkspok>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dmpWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TfUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4358%2C3608983 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington|agency=United Press |title=Clark Gable joins search for plane wreckage holding fate of Carole Lombard and 21 others |date=January 17, 1942 |page=1}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
Lombard's funeral was January 21 at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]]. She was interred beside her mother under the name of Carole Lombard Gable. Despite remarrying twice following her death, Gable was interred beside Lombard when he died in 1960. The crash remains are still on Potosi, although they are very difficult to find due to slope and brush.

Lombard's final film, ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'', directed by [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and co-starring [[Jack Benny]], a satire about [[Nazism]] and [[World War II]], was in [[post-production]] at the time of her death. The film's producers decided to cut part of the film in which Lombard's character asks, "What can happen on a plane?" out of respect for the circumstances surrounding her death.{{Sfn|Brooks Brooks 2006|p=104}} When the film was released, it received mixed reviews, particularly about its controversial content, but Lombard's performance was hailed as the perfect send-off to one of 1930s Hollywood's most important stars.

At the time of her death, Lombard had been scheduled to star in the film ''[[They All Kissed the Bride]]''; when production started, she was replaced by [[Joan Crawford]].{{Sfn|Ford 2011|p=41}} Crawford donated all of her salary for the film to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], which had helped extensively in the recovery of bodies from the air crash. Shortly after Lombard's death, Gable, who was inconsolable and devastated by his loss, joined the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. Lombard had asked him to do that numerous times after the United States had entered World War II. After officer training, Gable headed a six-man motion picture unit attached to a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] [[USAAF bombardment group|bomb group]] in England to film aerial gunners in combat, flying five missions himself. In December 1943, the United States Maritime Commission announced that a [[Liberty ship]] named after Carole Lombard would be launched.<ref>"Tribute to Carole Lombard" (December 29, 1943).''The Stars and Stripes'', p. 4.</ref> Gable attended the launch of the [[List of Liberty ships (A–F)|SS ''Carole Lombard'']] on January 15, 1944, the two-year anniversary of Lombard's record-breaking war bond drive. The ship was involved in rescuing hundreds of survivors from sunken ships in the Pacific and returning them to safety.

In 1962, Jill Winkler Rath, widow of publicist Otto Winkler, filed a $100,000 lawsuit against the $2,000,000 estate of Clark Gable in connection with Winkler's death in the plane crash with Carole Lombard. The suit was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Rath, in her action, claimed Gable promised to provide financial aid for her if she would not bring suit against the airline involved. Rath stated she later learned that Gable settled his claim against the airline for $10. He did so because he did not want to repeat his grief in court and subsequently provided her no financial aid in his will.<ref>"Widow Gets Zero".

==Legacy==
[[File:HollywoodWalkofFameCaroleLombardsStar.jpg|thumb|Lombard's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]

Author Robert D. Matzen has cited Lombard as "among the most commercially successful and admired film personalities in Hollywood in the 1930s",{{sfn|Matzen 1988}} and feminist writer June Sochen believes that Lombard "demonstrated great knowledge of the mechanics of film making".{{Sfn|Sochen 1999|p=95}} George Raft, her co-star in ''Bolero'', was extremely fond of the actress, remarking "I truly loved Carole Lombard. She was the greatest girl that ever lived and we were the best of pals. Completely honest and outspoken, she was liked by everyone".{{sfn|Yablonsky 2000|p=95}}

Historian Olympia Kiriakou identifies Lombard as a progressive, feminist studio-era star. She describes Lombard's politics as "proto-feminist," explaining that "many of her political and social statements pre-date the second-wave feminist movement, yet were very much in line with the second wave’s focus," particularly her views about women's roles in the home and workplace. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Kiriakou |first1=Olympia |title=Becoming Carole Lombard: Stardom, Comedy, and Legacy |date=2020 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=9781501350733 |pages=177}}</ref> Lombard's independent star persona balanced her femininity and screen glamour with "male business sense."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carman |first1=Emily |title=Independent Stardom: Female Film Stars and the Studio System of the 1930s |journal=Women's Studies |date=2008 |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=585}}</ref> She was described by ''Photoplay'' columnist Hart Seymore as the "perfect example of a modern Career Girl," which was based on Lombard’s capability to “live by the logical premise that women have equal rights with men."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carman |first1=Emily |title=Independent Stardom: Female Film Stars and the Studio System of the 1930s |journal=Women's Studies |date=2008 |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=609}}</ref> In 1937, ''Photoplay'' published an article about Lombard's business acumen entitled "Carole Lombard tells: 'How I Live by a Man's Code'," in which she offers readers rules for how to be successful in business and at home such as "“play fair [with men]...don’t burn over criticism - stand up to it like a man."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Seymore |first1=Hart |title=Carole Lombard tells: "How I Live By A Man's Code |journal=Photoplay |date=June 1937 |pages=12}}</ref> Notably, in the article Lombard tells readers that she “doesn’t believe in a man’s world,” and encourages women to “work - and like it," adding: “All women should have something worthwhile to do, and cultivate efficiency at it, whether it be housekeeping or raising chickens. Working women are interesting women."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Seymore |first1=Hart |title=Carole Lombard tells: "How I Live By A Man's Code |journal=Photoplay |date=June 1937 |pages=12}}</ref> But as Kiriakou explains, such an article was published in order "to elicit a specific response from the fan magazine readers - namely, to view Lombard’s independent star as indistinguishable from the Lombard heroines they saw on screen."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kiriakou |first1=Olympia |title=Becoming Carole Lombard: Stardom, Comedy, and Legacy |date=2020 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=9781501350733 |pages=182}}</ref> 

Moreover, according to scholar Emily Carman, Lombard’s independent female star persona was only able to emerge only when she “attained greater professional autonomy in the mid-1930s," ultimately leading her to become one of the first stars of the studio-era to go freelance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carman |first1=Emily |title=Independent Stardom: Female Film Stars and the Studio System of the 1930s |journal=Women's Studies |date=2008 |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=585}}</ref> Freelancing gave Lombard more autonomy over her career decisions, and the types of roles she was able to play. Additionally, Lombard was the first Hollywood star to propose profit participation: in 1938, she negotiated with Selznick International Pictures to take a reduced salary of $100,000 in exchange for a 20 percent cut of the distributor’s gross of $1.6 to $1.7 million, and subsequent smaller percentages as the gross increased.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carman |first1=Emily |title=Independent Stardom: Freelance Women in the Hollywood Studio System |date=2015 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9781477307311 |pages=158}}</ref> Carman explains that this contract also included a "no-loan out" clause, the right to employ Travis Banton as her costume designer of choice, as well as all legal rights to her image.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carman |first1=Emily |title=Independent Stardom: Freelance Women in the Hollywood Studio System |date=2015 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9781477307311 |pages=24}}</ref> Carman concludes that Lombard's strategic business sense and easy-going nature were central to her independent star persona, and the control she maintained over her career was a challenge to the “paternalistic structure” of the studio system.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carman |first1=Emily |title=Independent Stardom: Freelance Women in the Hollywood Studio System |date=2015 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9781477307311 |pages=4}}</ref>

Lombard was particularly noted for the zaniness of her performances,{{sfnm|1a1=Balio 1995|1p=276|2a1=Mitchell 2001|2p=16}} described as a "natural prankster, a salty tongued straight-shooter, a feminist precursor and one of the few stars who was beloved by the technicians and studio functionaries who worked with her".<ref name="PT05">{{cite web|author=Gordon, Jim|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-109EAC379294EFBA.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611111329/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-109EAC379294EFBA.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|title=Fort Wayne home to 'Profane Angel'|publisher= The Post-Tribune| via =HighBeam Research {{subscription}}|date=May 1, 2005|accessdate=April 4, 2014}}</ref>  ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine noted that her film personality transcended to real life, "her conversation, often brilliant, is punctuated by screeches, laughs, growls, gesticulations and the expletives of a sailor's parrot".<ref name="Inc1938">{{cite book|title=Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60wEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA50|date=October 17, 1938|publisher=Time Inc|page=50|issn=0024-3019}}</ref> [[Graham Greene]] praised the "heartbreaking and nostalgic melodies" of her faster-than-thought delivery, whereas  ''The Independent'' wrote, "Platinum blonde, with a heart-shaped face, delicate, impish features and a figure made to be swathed in silver lamé, Lombard wriggled expressively through such classics of hysteria as ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' and ''[[My Man Godfrey]]''."<ref>{{cite news|author=Koenig, Rhoda|date=June 24, 2005|title=The Queen of Comedy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-queen-of-comedy-496273.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=December 28, 2013}}</ref>
