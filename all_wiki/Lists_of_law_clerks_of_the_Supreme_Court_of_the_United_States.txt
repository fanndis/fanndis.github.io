The '''lists of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States''' cover the [[law clerk]]s who have assisted the justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in various capacities since the first one was hired by Justice [[Horace Gray]] in 1882.<ref name="Peppers2006">{{cite book |last=Peppers |first=Todd C. |title=Courtiers of the Marble Palace: The Rise and Influence of the Supreme Court Law Clerk| year=2006| page=1| publisher=Stanford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NxiMWr730EcC| isbn=978-0-8047-5382-1}}</ref> The list is divided into separate lists for each position in the Supreme Court.

Each justice is permitted to have between three and four law clerks per Court [[Term (time)|term]]. Most clerks are recent [[Law school in the United States|law school]] graduates, who have typically graduated at the top of their class.<ref>{{cite web| title=Supreme Court Procedures| url=http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/supreme-1| website=uscourts.gov| publisher=[[Administrative Office of the United States Courts]]| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=December 23, 2018}}</ref> Among their many functions, clerks do legal research that assists justices in deciding what cases to accept and what questions to ask during oral arguments, prepare [[Bench memorandum|memoranda]], and draft [[Court order|orders]] and [[Judicial opinion|opinions]].<ref name=WardWeiden2006>{{cite book| last1=Ward| first1=Artemus| last2=Weiden| first2=David L.| year=2006| title=Sorcerers' Apprentices: 100 Years of Law Clerks at the United States Supreme Court| publisher=New York University Press| location=New York, New York| pages=1–5| isbn=978-0-8147-9404-3}}</ref> Research suggests that clerks exert a moderate influence on how justices vote in cases, but have "substantial influence in cases that are high-profile, legally significant, or close decisions".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sen|first=Maya|last2=Rozema|first2=Kyle|last3=Goldin|first3=Jacob|last4=Chilton|first4=Adam|last5=Bonica|first5=Adam|title=Legal Rasputins?

Note that, due to the several changes in the size of the Court since it was established in 1789, two seats have been abolished, both as a result of the [[Judicial Circuits Act]] of 1866 (and before the Court established the practice of hiring law clerks). Consequently, neither "seat 5" nor "seat 7" has a list article. Also, the seat numbers in these articles are not derived from official United States federal government sources, but are used as a way of organizing and detailing the succession of justices over the years since the first set of justices were [[Advice and consent|confirmed]] by the [[United States Senate]].
