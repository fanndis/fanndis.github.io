The '''United States Social Security Administration''' ('''SSA''')<ref>(SSA Pub. No 25-1556 p. 7)</ref> is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] that administers [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], a [[social insurance]] program consisting of [[retirement]], [[disability]], and survivor benefits. To qualify for most of these benefits, most workers pay [[Social Security tax]]es on their earnings; the claimant's benefits are based on the wage earner's contributions. Otherwise benefits such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are given based on need.

The Social Security Administration was established by a [https://uscode.house.gov/codification/legislation.shtml non-positive law] codified at {{usc|42|901}} ({{usstat|49|635}}). It was created in 1935 as the "Social Security Board", then assumed its present name in 1946.  Its current leader, Commissioner [[Andrew Saul]], has served since June 2019, succeeding Acting Commissioner [[Nancy Berryhill]].

SSA is headquartered in [[Woodlawn, Baltimore County, Maryland|Woodlawn, Maryland]], just to the west of [[Baltimore]], at what is known as Central Office. The agency includes 10 regional offices, 8 processing centers, approximately 1300 field offices, and 37 Teleservice Centers. {{As of|2018}}, about 60,000 people were employed by SSA.<ref>SSA, [http://www.ssa.gov/otherssasites/ How We're Organized], accessed 23 July 2018</ref> Headquarters non-supervisory employees of SSA are represented by [[American Federation of Government Employees]] Local 1923. Social Security is the largest social welfare program in the United States. For 2014, the net cost of Social Security was $906.4 billion, an amount corresponding to 21% of US Federal Government expenditures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/finrep/fr/14frusg/FR_02252015_Final.pdf|title=Financial Report Fiscal Year 2014 of the United States Government|accessdate=2015-02-25}}</ref>

In 1939, the Social Security Board merged into a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]-level [[Federal Security Agency]], which included the SSB, the [[U.S. Public Health Service]], the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], and other agencies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/1930.html |title=Special Collections Chronology: 1930 |publisher=U.S. Government |author=Social Security Administration |accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref> In January 1940, the first regular ongoing monthly benefits began.<ref name="SSA Pub.

In 1946, the SSB was renamed the Social Security Administration under President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s Reorganization Plan.

In 1953, the Federal Security Agency was abolished and SSA was placed under the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]], which became the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] in 1980. In 1994, President [[Bill Clinton]] amended [https://uscode.house.gov/codification/legislation.shtml non-positive law] {{usc|42|901}} and returned SSA to the status of an independent agency in the executive branch of government. In 1972, [[Cost of Living]] Adjustments (COLAs) were introduced into SSA programs to deal with the effects of [[inflation]] on [[fixed income]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/cola/|title=Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) Information {{!}} Social Security Administration|website=www.ssa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-06}}</ref>

SSA was one of the first federal agencies to have its national headquarters outside of [[Washington, D.C.]], or its adjacent suburbs. It was located in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] initially due to the need for a building that was capable of holding the unprecedented amount of paper records that would be needed. Nothing suitable was available in Washington in 1936, so the Social Security Board selected the Candler Building on Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor|harbor]] as a temporary location. Soon after locating there, construction began on a permanent building for SSA in Washington that would meet their requirements for record storage capacity. However, by the time the new building was completed, [[World War II]] had started, and the building was commandeered by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]. By the time the war ended, it was judged too disruptive to relocate the agency to Washington. The Agency remained in the Candler Building until 1960, when it relocated to its newly built headquarters in Woodlawn.
 		
The road on which the headquarters is located, built especially for SSA, is named [[Maryland Route 122|Security Boulevard (Maryland Route 122)]] and has since become one of the major arteries connecting Baltimore with its western suburbs. Security Boulevard is also the name of SSA's exit from the nearby Baltimore Beltway ([[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|Interstate 695]]). A nearby [[shopping center]] has been named [[Security Square Mall]], and Woodlawn is often referred to informally as "Security." [[Interstate 70]], which runs for thousands of miles from [[Utah]] to [[Maryland]], terminates in a [[park and ride]] lot that adjoins the SSA campus.

Due to space constraints and ongoing renovations, many headquarters employees work in leased space throughout the Woodlawn area. Other SSA components are located elsewhere. For example, the headquarters (also known as Central Office) of SSA's Office of Disability Adjudication and Review is located in [[Falls Church, Virginia]].

== Program Service Centers ==

Much of the actual processing of initial benefits and subsequent adjustments to benefits is done in six large Program Service Centers located around the country.<ref name="poms-psc">{{cite web | url=https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0201050051 | title=GN 01050.051 Who reviews and services claims | work=Program Operations Manual System (POMS) | publisher=Social Security Administration | date=May 25, 2018 | accessdate=March 17, 2019}}</ref>

They have been located in these six cities going back to at least the early 1950s.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WW9KAQAAMAAJ&q=%22social+security%22+%22payment+centers%22+philadelphia+%22kansas+city%22+1952 | title=Analysis of the Social Security System: Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, 83rd Congress, First Session, Parts 1-8 | publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office | date=1953 | page=570}}</ref>
The origins of the payment centers date back to 1942, when they were known as Area Offices.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/orghist.html | title=Organizational History | work=Social Security History | publisher=Social Security Administration | accessdate=March 17, 2019}}</ref>  The first one was established in Philadelphia, with ones in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] soon following.<ref name="ssa-oh-mf"/>

In addition, there are specialized processing centers for the Office of Earnings and International Operations and the Office of Disability Operations, both located in Baltimore.<ref name="poms-psc"/>

Before the mid-1970s, the Program Service Centers were called Payment Centers.<ref name="hearings-1961">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gQX6ireOPkC&pg=RA2-PA301 | title=Supplemental Appropriation Bill for 1962: Hearings, Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate, 87th Congress, First Session, H.R. 9169 | publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office | date=1961 | page=301}}</ref>  By the late 1960s, the Payment Centers had acquired a reputation as sources of poor bureaucratic performance that people did not want to work in, and a reorganization under a modules system was undertaken during the 1970s in an effort to improve matters.<ref name="ssa-oh-mf">{{cite web | url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/miltforal.html | title=Historical Interview with Milton Freedman | work=Social Security History: Oral Histories | date=January 18, 1974 | first=O.

The centers have each employed around two thousand people or more, 
giving them a major local economic impact,
and even relocations within the same metropolitan area have created political conflict.
When in the early 1970s, SSA and the [[General Services Administration]] said it intended to move payment center
operations out of San Francisco and across the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] to Richmond, the moved was opposed by San Francisco-representing Congressman [[Phillip Burton]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/460639579/?terms=%22social%2Bsecurity%22%2B%22payment%2Bcenter%22%2B%22san%2Bfrancisco%22%2Brichmond | title=S.F. to Lose Big Payroll? | newspaper=The San Francisco Examiner | date=December 7, 1972 | page=11 | via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> 
Burton's efforts were in vain, however, as construction in a redevelopment area in Richmond commenced and the move was made around 1975.<ref name="sfe-73">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/460271235/?terms=%22social%2Bsecurity%22%2B%22payment%2Bcenter%22%2B%22san%2Bfrancisco%22%2Brichmond | title=Richmond To Dig S.F.

Similarly, in the late 1970s, SSA, the General Services Administration, and the [[Carter administration]] devised a plan to move the program service center from its main location, in two leased buildings on [[Horace Harding Expressway]] in [[Lefrak City]] in Rego Park, to a new federal building planned for a revitalization zone in the center of the Jamaica area of Queens.<ref name="nyt-nov79">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/16/archives/federal-building-in-queens-urged-to-aid-economy.html | title=Federal Building in Queens Urged to Aid Economy | first=Irvin | last=Molotsky | newspaper=The New York Times | date=November 16, 1979 | page=B3}}</ref><ref name="nydn-apr80-b">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/484952241/?terms=%22social%2Bsecurity%22%2BAddabbo%2BFederal%2BBuilding%2B%2B%22jamaica%22 | title=A biz district is finding the road back | first=Gus | last=Dallas | newspaper=Daily News | location=New York | date=April 20, 1980 | page=3B XQL | via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>  The move was championed by Congressman [[Joseph P.

The move was also supported by Representative [[Geraldine Ferraro]], another powerful Queens figure, who sat on the [[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|House Public Works Committee]].<ref name="nyt-nov79"/>
The dispute was aired in Congressional hearings and embroiled Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] and developer [[Richard Lefrak]], supporting and opposing the move respectively, as well.<ref name="nydn-apr80">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/484952241/?terms=%22social%2Bsecurity%22%2BAddabbo%2BFederal%2BBuilding%2B%2B%22jamaica%22 | title=Battle's building up on fed office | first=David | last=Hardy | newspaper=Daily News | location=New York | date=April 20, 1980 | pages=1B, 3B XQL | via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

== Coverage ==
[[Image:Mid-Atlantic Social Security Center view of NW corner 2019.jpg|thumb|left|The Mid-Atlantic Program Services Center in Philadelphia]]
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
SSA's coverage under the Social Security Acts originally extended to nearly all workers in the [[Continental United States|continental U.S.]] and the territories of [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]], Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands below the age of 65. All workers in [[Interstate commerce#Significance|interstate commerce and industry]] were required to enter the program, except railroad, state and local government workers. In 1939, the age restriction for entering Social Security was eliminated.

Railroad workers were covered by the [[Railroad Retirement Board]] before Social Security was founded.  Today, they still are, though a portion of each railroad pension is designated as "equivalent" to Social Security.  Railroad workers also participate in Medicare.

Most state and local government workers were eventually brought into the Social Security system under "'''Section 218 Agreements'''". The original 218 interstate instrumentalities were signed in the 1950s, and all states have a Section 218 agreement with the federal government's Social Security Administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.10/handbook-1002.html|title=Terms Defined for Section 218 Agreement Purposes|publisher=Social Security Administration}}</ref>
The Social Security Handbook defines an "interstate instrumentality".<ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.10/handbook-1002.html "What is an interstate instrumentality?] Social Security Handbook (July 8, 2004), Section 1002.3.</ref>
The provisions of Section 218 of the Social Security Act and the instrumentalities agreement and subsequent modifications determine Social Security and Medicare benefits or Medicare-only coverage for state and local government employees enrolled in state and local government retirement systems.
All state and local government employees hired since 1986, or whom are covered by Section 218 Agreements, participate in Medicare even if not covered by Social Security financial benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/10051.html |title=Social Security Publications |publisher=Socialsecurity.gov |accessdate=2012-05-09}}</ref> To see how state and local government employees are covered by Social Security and Medicare see the Federal-State reference guide appendix.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p963.pdf |title=Publication 963 (Rev. 11-2011) |accessdate=2012-05-09}}</ref>
Other local and state employees were brought into coverage under a 1991 Social Security law that required these employees to join Social Security if their employer did not provide them with a pension plan.
Some state and local governments continue to maintain pension plans and have not executed Section 218 agreements; if so, those workers may not participate in Social Security taxation.  (If workers have previously paid appropriate Social Security taxation or an equivalent, their Social Security benefits are reduced by a rule known as the '''Windfall Elimination Provision'''; there is also a similar '''Government Pension Offset''' for their spouses.)

=== Old age, survivors and disability ===
[[Image:Sculpture "Batcolumn" at Harold Washington Social Security Center, Chicago, Illinois LCCN2010719962.tif|thumb|right|upright=0.75|The Great Lakes Program Service Center is housed in the Harold Washington Social Security Center in Chicago]]

SSA administers the retirement, survivors, and disabled social insurance programs, which can provide monthly benefits to aged or disabled workers, their spouses and children, and to the survivors of insured workers. In 2010, more than 54 million Americans received approximately $712 billion in Social Security benefits. The programs are primarily financed by taxes which employers, employees, and the self-insured pay annually. These revenues are placed into a special [[Social Security trust fund|trust fund]]. These programs are collectively known as [[Retirement, Survivors, Disability Insurance]] (RSDI).

SSA administers its disability program partly through its Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR), which has regional offices and hearing offices across the United States. ODAR publishes a manual, called [[HALLEX]], which contains instructions for its employees regarding how to implement its guiding principles and procedures.

The RSDI program is the primary benefits program administered by the U.S. federal government, and for some beneficiaries is the vital source of income. Increasing access to this benefit program for low-income or homeless individuals is one of SSA's goals. SSA is a member of the [[United States Interagency Council on Homelessness]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usich.gov/member_agency |title=Member Agency &#124; United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) |publisher=Usich.gov |accessdate=2012-05-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424055302/http://www.usich.gov/member_agency |archive-date=2012-04-24 }}</ref> and works with other municipal, county, state, local and federal partners to increase access and approval for SSI/SSDI benefits who are eligible.

=== Supplemental Security Income (SSI) ===
[[Image:Social Security Administration Offices, 3971 South Research Park Drive, Ann Arbor, Michigan - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|An SSA field office in Ann Arbor, Michigan]]

SSA also administers the [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) program, which is needs-based, for the aged, blind, or disabled. This program originally went under two separate names, Old Age Assistance (originally Title I of the Social Security Act of 1935), and Disability Assistance (added in 1946).  In 1973, these assistance programs were renamed and reassigned to SSA. SSI recipients are paid out of the general revenue of the United States of America. In addition, some states pay additional SSI funds. As of January 2018, over 8 million people receive SSI.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/supplemental-security-income-ssi|title=Supplemental Security Income (SSI)|date=2018-01-29|work=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en}}</ref>

For some claimants, this program is harder to receive than funds from RSDI. To warrant a processing time of anything more than a day and an immediate denial, certain specific criteria must be met, including citizenship status, having less than $2,000.00 in countable financial resources, or having countable income of less than $718.00 per month from any source.  Disposal of a financial resource (i.e., a deliberate spend-down to fall under SSI resource ceilings) can prevent a person from receiving SSI benefits for a period up to 36 months.  Every person with or without a [[Social Security Number]] is eligible to apply.  But if a person does not meet any of the above criteria or is not a documented resident of the United States, his or her claim can only be taken on paper and will be immediately denied.  Even documented residents with legal permanent resident status after August 1996 are immediately denied unless they meet some or all of the SSI criteria listed above.

===Medicare===
The administration of the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program is a responsibility of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], but SSA offices are used for determining initial eligibility, some processing of premium payments, and for limited public contact information.  They also administer a financial needs-based program which supplements Medicare Part D program enrollees.  This program may be applied for at any time, even previous to enrollment in Part D. It only provides no more than a $40.00 relief for monthly Medicare Part D premiums.

==Operations==
To ensure consistent and efficient treatment of Social Security beneficiaries across its vast bureaucracy, SSA has compiled a giant book known as the Program Operations Manual System (POMS) which governs practically all aspects of SSA's internal operations.  POMS describes, in excruciating detail, a huge variety of situations regularly encountered by SSA personnel, and the exact policies and procedures that apply to each situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/Home?readform|title=SSA's Policy Information Site - POMS - About POMS|website=secure.ssa.gov}}</ref>

===Automation===

While the establishment of Social Security predated the invention of the modern [[Computer|digital computer]], [[punched card]] data processing was a [[mature technology]], and the Social Security system made extensive use of automated [[unit record equipment]] from the program's inception. This allowed the Social Security Administration to achieve a high level of efficiency. SSA expenses have always been a small fraction of benefits paid. As a percentage of assets, the administration costs are 0.39%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/ssps/ssp-15es.html |title=Administration Costs and the Relative Efficiency of Public and Private Social Security Systems |publisher=CATO Institute |author=Robert Genetski |accessdate=2010-09-27}}</ref>

===Adjudication===
SSA operates its own administrative adjudication system, which has [[original jurisdiction]] when claims are denied in part or in full. SSA decisions are issued by Administrative Law Judges and Senior Attorney Adjudicators (supported by about 6,000 staff employees) at locations throughout the United States of the U.S. Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR), who hear and decide challenges to SSA decisions. Dissatisfied claimants can appeal to ODAR's Appeals Council, and if still dissatisfied can appeal to a U.S. District Court.

Over the years, ODAR has developed its own procedural system, which is documented in the Hearings and Appeals Litigation Law Manual (HALLEX). ODAR was formerly known as the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) and, prior to the 1970s, the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals. The name was changed to ODAR in 2007 to reflect the fact that about 75% of the agency's docket consists of disability cases. ODAR also adjudicates disputes relating to retirement claims and has jurisdiction when the paternity of a claimant or the validity of a marriage is at issue when a claim is filed for benefits under the earnings record of a spouse or parent. The agency also adjudicates a limited number of Medicare claim issues, which is a residual legacy from when SSA was part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

==Criticism and controversy==
{{further|Social Security (United States)#Criticisms}}
[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] reported that SSA made a $32.3 billion mistake when reporting 2009 U.S. wage statistics. The error when corrected, further reduces the average 2009 U.S. wage to $39,055.<ref>{{cite web |last=Donmoyer |first=Ryan J. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-02/-invalid-multiple-tax-forms-by-supposed-billionaires-skew-wage-figures.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104022813/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-02/-invalid-multiple-tax-forms-by-supposed-billionaires-skew-wage-figures.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-11-04 |title='Invalid' Forms by Supposed Billionaires Skew U.S. Wage Figures |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2012-05-09 }}</ref> In 2009 the average U.S. wage was reported as $39,269.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tax.com/taxcom/taxblog.nsf/0971609221721415852572ac0067c130/6b48105c474ae41f852577c4005d04c1/$FILE/Tables%20(continued)%20.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130083847/http://tax.com/taxcom/taxblog.nsf/0971609221721415852572ac0067c130/6b48105c474ae41f852577c4005d04c1/$FILE/Tables%20(continued)%20.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-11-30 |title=Reversing Trends |accessdate=2012-05-09}}</ref>

==Baby name popularity report==
Each year, just before [[Mother's Day]], SSA releases a list of the names most commonly given to newborn babies in the United States in the previous year, based on applications for Social Security cards. The report includes the 1,000 most common names for both genders.  The Popular Baby Names page on the SSA website provides the complete list and allows searches for past years and particular names.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/babynames |title=Popular Baby Names |publisher=U.S. Government |author=Social Security Administration |accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref>
