It is the capital of the [[Loiret]] [[Departments of France|department]] and of the [[Centre-Val de Loire]] [[Regions of France|region]].

Orléans is located on the [[Loire|Loire River]] nestled in the heart of the Loire Valley, classified as a [[Loire Valley|World Heritage Site]], where the river curves south towards the [[Massif Central]]. In 2017, the city had 116,685 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries. Orléans is the center of [[Orléans Métropole]] that has a population of 286,257, the 20th largest in France. The larger [[aire urbaine|metropolitan area]] has a population of 444,681.

Former capital of the [[kingdom of France]] in the 5th century after its conquest by [[Clovis I|Clovis]]. The figure of [[Joan of Arc]] is inseparable from the history of the city, since she played a decisive role on [[Siege of Orléans|May 8, 1429]] in liberating the city from the English during the [[Hundred Years' War|Hundred Years War.]] Her figure, omnipresent, stands proudly on the Place du Martroi. Every year, Orléans pays homage to her during the Johannic Holidays; since 2018, it has been listed in the inventory of intangible cultural heritage in France.

The city owes its development from [[antiquity]]{{dn|date=November 2020}} to the commercial exchanges resulting from the river. An important river trade port, it will be the headquarters of the Community of Merchants frequenting the Loire River. Capital at the [[Merovingian period]], theatre of the [[Hundred Years' War]]  and land of many royal coronations; the city has a great historical and patrimonial wealth, which allowed it to join the circle of Cities of Art and History since 2009. With a University created in 1306 by [[Pope Clement V]], and re-founded in 1966, the [[University of Orléans]] hosts 19,002 students in 2019.

[[Île d'Orléans]] in Quebec, Canada is named after Orléans in France as well as [[Orléans, Ontario]] and the former French colony [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. (French: ''La Nouvelle-Orléans'')

==Geography==
[[File:ORLEANS From Flight ORY-MAD 737 EC-LQX (7951291066).jpg|thumb|left|Orléans from above|270px]]
Orléans is located in the northern bend of the [[Loire]], which crosses from east to west. Orléans belongs to the [[Loire Valley|vallée de la Loire]] sector between [[Sully-sur-Loire]] and [[Chalonnes-sur-Loire]], which was in 2000 inscribed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage site|World Heritage Site]]. The capital of [[Orléanais]], 120 kilometres southwest of Paris, is bordered to the north by the [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] region, more specifically the [[Forest of Orléans|Orléans Forest]] (French: ''forêt d'Orléans'') and Orléans-la-Source neighbourhood, and the [[Sologne]] region to the south.

Five bridges in the city cross the Loire River: Pont de l'Europe, Pont du Maréchal Joffre (also called Pont Neuf), [[George V Bridge, Orléans|Pont George-V]] (also called Pont Royal, carrying the commune [[trams|tramway]]), Pont René-Thinat and Pont de Vierzon (rail bridge).
[[File:Orléans Pont George V 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[George V Bridge, Orléans|Pont George-V]]|270px]]

To the north of the Loire (''rive droite'') is to be found a small hill ({{Convert|102|m|abbr=on}} at the pont Georges-V, {{Convert|110|m|abbr=on}} at the Place du Martroi) which gently rises to {{Convert|125|m|abbr=on}} at la Croix Fleury, at the limits of [[Fleury-les-Aubrais]]. Conversely, the south (on the ''rive gauche'') has a gentle [[depression (geology)|depression]] to about {{Convert|95|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at Saint-Marceau) between the Loire and the Loiret, designated a "zone inondable" (flood-risk zone).

At the end of the 1960s, the Orléans-la-Source neighbourhood was created, {{Convert|12|km|mi|0}}to the south of the original commune and separated from it by the Val d'Orléans and the [[Loiret River]] (whose source is in the [[Parc Floral de la Source]]). This quarter's altitude varies from about {{Convert|100|to|110|m|abbr=on}}.

===The Loire and navigation===
In Orléans, the Loire is separated by a submerged [[dike (construction)|dike]] known as the ''dhuis'' into the ''Grande Loire'' to the north, no longer navigable, and the ''Petite Loire'' to the south. This dike is just one part of a vast system of construction that previously allowed the Loire to remain navigable to this point.

The Loire was formerly an important navigation and trading route. With the increase in size of ocean-going ships, large ships can now navigate the [[estuary]] only up to about [[Nantes]].

Boats on the river were traditionally flat-bottomed boats, with large but foldable masts so the sails could gather wind from above the river banks, but the masts could be lowered in order to allow the boats to pass under bridges. these vessels are known as ''gabarre,'' ''futreau,'' and so on, and may be viewed by tourists near pont Royal.

The river's irregular flow strongly limits traffic on it, in particular at its ascent, though this can be overcome by boats being given a tow.
[[File:La Loire à Orléans.jpg|thumb|The Loire as it flows through Orléans|400px]]
An ''Inexplosible''-type paddle steamer owned by the mairie was put in place in August 2007, facing Place de la Loire and containing a bar.

Every two years, the Festival de Loire recalls the role played by the river in the commune's history.

On the river's north bank, near the town centre, is the [[Canal d'Orléans]], which connects to the [[Canal du Loing]] and the [[Canal de Briare]] at [[Buges]] near [[Montargis]]. The canal is no longer used along its whole length. Its route within Orléans runs parallel to the river, separated from it by a wall or ''muret'', with a promenade along the top. Its last [[canal pound|pound]] was transformed into an outdoor swimming pool in the 1960s, then filled in. It was reopened in 2007 for the "fêtes de Loire." There are plans to revive use of the canal for recreation and install a pleasure-boat port there.

===Climate===
Orléans experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), similar to much of central France.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Orléans}}

===Prehistory and Roman Empire===
:''See also [[Cenabum]], Aureliana Civitas.''
'''Cenabum''' was a [[Gauls|Gallic]] stronghold, one of the principal towns of the tribe of the [[Carnutes]] where the [[Druid]]s held their annual assembly. The [[Carnutes]] were massacred and the city was destroyed by [[Julius Caesar]] in 52 BC,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=7:chapter=28|title=C. Julius Caesar, Gallic War, Book 7, chapter 28|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2018-02-16}}</ref> then a new city was built on its ruins by settlers from the [[Aurelia (gens)|gens Aurelia]] who named the city, '''civitas Aurelianorum''' ("city of the Aurelii"), after themselves. The name later evolved into Orléans.<ref>For an exact etymology, see ''Cenabum, Aurelianis, Orléans'' de Jacques Debal (Coll. Galliae civitates, Lyon, PUL, 1996)</ref>

In 442 Flavius Aetius, the Roman commander in Gaul, requested [[Goar]], head of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] tribe of [[Alans]] in the region to come to Orleans and control the rebellious natives and the Visigoths. Accompanying the [[Vandals]], the Alans crossed the Loire in 408. One of their groups, under [[Goar]], joined the Roman forces of [[Flavius Aetius]] to fight [[Attila]] when he invaded Gaul in 451, taking part in the [[Battle of Châlons]] under their king [[Sangiban]]. Goar established his capital in Orléans. His successors later took possession of the estates in the region between Orléans and Paris. Installed in Orléans and along the Loire, they were unruly (killing the town's senators when they felt they had been paid too slowly or too little) and resented by the local inhabitants. Many inhabitants around the present city have names bearing witness to the Alan presence – Allaines. Also many places in the region bear names of Alan origin.<ref>[http://www.marres.education/alans.htm marres.education]. Accessed January 2016.</ref>

===Early Middle Ages===
In the [[Merovingian]] era, the city was capital of the Kingdom of Orléans following [[Clovis I]]'s division of the kingdom, then under the [[House of Capet|Capetian]]s it became the capital of a [[Count of Orléans|county]] then [[Duke of Orléans|duchy]] held in [[appanage]] by the house of [[duke of Orléans|Valois-Orléans]]. The Valois-Orléans family later acceded to the throne of France via [[Louis XII]] then [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. In 1108, one of the few consecrations of a French monarch to occur outside of [[Reims]] occurred at Orléans, when [[Louis VI of France]] was consecrated in [[Orléans cathedral]] by [[Daimbert, Archbishop of Sens|Daimbert]], [[archbishop of Sens]].

===High Middle Ages===
[[File:View of Orléans 1428 - Project Gutenberg etext 19488.jpg|thumb|left|Orléans in September 1428, the time of the [[Siege of Orléans]].]]
The city was always a strategic point on the Loire, for it was sited at the river's most northerly point, and thus its closest point to Paris. There were few bridges over the dangerous [[river Loire]], but Orléans had one of them, and so became – with [[Rouen]] and Paris – one of medieval France's three richest cities.
[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 18.JPG|thumbnail|250px|15th-century depiction of the French troops attacking an English fort at the siege of Orléans]]
On the south bank the "[[Fortress|châtelet]] des Tourelles" protected access to the bridge. This was the site of the [[Siege of Orléans|battle]] on 8 May 1429 which allowed [[Joan of Arc]] to enter and lift the siege of the [[Plantagenets]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]], with the help of the royal generals [[Jean de Dunois|Dunois]] and Florent d'[[Illiers-Combray|Illiers]]. The city's inhabitants have continued to remain faithful and grateful to her to this day, calling her "la pucelle d'Orléans" (the maid of Orléans), offering her a middle-class house in the city, and contributing to her ransom when she was taken prisoner.

===1453 to 1699===
[[File:1581-Aurelia Franciae civitas ad Ligeri flu.JPG|thumb|''Aurelia Franciae civitas ad Ligeri flu. sita'' (1581)]]
[[File:Hôtel Groslot, Orléans, France, 2012..JPG|thumb|The Renaissance Hôtel Groslot]]
Once the [[Hundred Years' War]] was over, the city recovered its former prosperity. The bridge brought in tolls and taxes, as did the merchants passing through the city. King [[Louis XI]] also greatly contributed to its prosperity, revitalising agriculture in the surrounding area (particularly the exceptionally fertile land around [[Beauce, France|Beauce]]) and relaunching [[saffron]] farming at [[Pithiviers]]. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], the city benefited from its becoming fashionable for rich [[châtelain]]s to travel along the Loire valley (a fashion begun by the king himself, whose royal domains included the nearby châteaus at [[Chambord, Loir-et-Cher|Chambord]], [[Amboise]], [[Blois]], and [[Château de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]]).

The [[University of Orléans]] also contributed to the city's prestige. Specializing in law, it was highly regarded throughout Europe. [[John Calvin]] was received and accommodated there (and wrote part of his reforming theses during his stay), and in return [[Henry VIII of England]] (who had drawn on Calvin's work in his separation from Rome) offered to fund a scholarship at the university. Many other Protestants were sheltered by the city. Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, better known by his pseudonym [[Molière]], also studied law at the University, but was expelled for attending a carnival contrary to university rules.

From 13 December 1560 to 31 January 1561, the [[Estates General (France)|French States-General]] after the death of [[Francis II of France]], the eldest son of [[Catherine de Médicis]] and [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]. He died in the Hôtel Groslot in Orléans, with his queen [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]] at his side.

The [[Orléans Cathedral|cathedral]] was rebuilt several times. The present structure had its first stone laid by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and work on it took a century. It thus is a mix of late Renaissance and early [[Rococo|Louis XIV]] styles, and one of the last cathedrals to be built in France.

===1700–1900===
When France colonised America, the territory it conquered was immense, including the whole [[Mississippi River]] (whose first European name was the River [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]]), from its mouth to its source at the borders of Canada. Its capital was named ''[[New Orleans|la Nouvelle-Orléans]]'' in honour of [[Louis XV]]'s regent, the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|duke of Orléans]], and was settled with French inhabitants against the threat from British troops to the north-east.

The Dukes of Orléans hardly ever visited their city since, as brothers or cousins of the king, they took such a major role in court life that they could hardly ever leave. The duchy of Orléans was the largest of the French duchies, starting at [[Arpajon]], continuing to [[Chartres]], [[Vendôme]], [[Blois]], [[Vierzon]], and [[Montargis]]. The duke's son bore the title ''duke of Chartres''. Inheritances from great families and marriage alliances allowed them to accumulate huge wealth, and one of them, [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe Égalité]], is sometimes said to have been the richest man in the world at the time. His son, King [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe I]], inherited the Penthièvre and Condé family fortunes.

1852 saw the creation of the ''Compagnies ferroviaires Paris-Orléans'' and its famous [[gare d'Orsay]] in Paris. In the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, the city again became strategically important thanks to its geographical position, and was occupied by the [[Prussia]]ns on 13 October that year. The ''[[armée de la Loire]]'' was formed under the orders of [[Louis d'Aurelle de Paladines|General d'Aurelle de Paladines]] and based itself not far from Orléans at [[Beauce, France|Beauce]].

===1900 to present===
[[File:US Army medics in Orleans, France 1944-08-19.JPEG|thumb|210px|US Army medics in Orléans, 1944]]
During the [[Second World War]], the German army made the ''Orléans Fleury-les-Aubrais'' railway station one of their central logistical rail hubs. The Pont Georges V was renamed "pont des Tourelles".<ref>World-wide current events of 16 May 1941, available on the site of the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]] ([http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&id_notice=AFE85000506 direct link]).</ref> A transit camp for deportees was built at [[Beaune-la-Rolande]]. During the Liberation, the American Air Force heavily bombed the city and the train station, causing much damage. The city was one of the first to be rebuilt after the war: the reconstruction plan and city improvement initiated by Jean Kérisel and Jean Royer was adopted as early as 1943, and work began as early as the start of 1945. This reconstruction in part identically reproduced what had been lost, such as Royale and its arcades, but also used innovative prefabrication techniques, such as îlot 4 under the direction of the architect [[Pol Abraham]].<ref>Joseph Abram, ''L'architecture moderne en France, du chaos à la croissance'', tome 2, éd. Picard, 1999, pp. 28 et 37–38</ref>

The big city of former times is today an average-sized city of 250,000 inhabitants. It is still using its strategically central position less than an hour from the French capital to attract businesses interested in reducing transport costs.

===Heraldry===

According to [[Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun]] in ''La France Illustrée'', 1882, Orléans's arms are "[[gules]], three caillous in ''cœurs de lys'' [[argent]], and on a chief [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]], three fleurs de lys [[or (heraldry)|Or]]."  Charle Grandmaison, in the ''Dictionnaire Héraldique'' of 1861, states that it is "Or, with three hearts in gules", without the chief of France. Sometimes, in faulty designs, we find it described "gules, three fleurs de lys argent, and on a chief azure three fleurs de lys Or."<ref>[[Grand Larousse encyclopédique]] in 10 volumes, 163</ref>

The design shown left shows 3 "cœurs de lys" (heart of a lily), seen from above. This "cœurs de lys" is therefore not a true lily, which would have 6 [[tepal]]s, but a hypothetical aerial view of a symbolic lily. It has probably also been stylised more and more in heraldry, as in the heart in a pack of cards. Certain authors solve the problem by calling this symbol a "[[tiercefeuille]]", defined as a stemless [[clover]] leaf, with one leaf at the top and two below, thus making this coat of arms "gules, with three reversed tiercefeuilles in argent, etc".

===Motto===
"Hoc vernant lilia corde" (granted by [[Louis XII]], then [[duke of Orléans]]), meaning "It is by this heart that lilies flourish" or "This heart makes lilies flourish", referring to the [[fleur de lys]], symbol of the French royal family.

==Transport==

===Public transport===
TAO manages buses and tram lines in Orléans, named [[Orléans tramway]] The first tram line was inaugurated November 20, 2000 and the second line on June 30, 2012. The network count 29.3km of rail and has transported 77,000 passengers in 2014.<ref>

===Roads and highway===
Orléans is an autoroute intersection : the [[Autoroute française A10|A10]] (linking Paris to [[Bordeaux]]) links to the commune outskirts, and [[Autoroute française A71|A71]] (whose bridge over the Loire is outside the commune limits) begins here, heading for the Mediterranean via [[Clermont-Ferrand]] (where it becomes the [[Autoroute française A75|A75]]).

===Railway===
[[File:Orleans gare hall.jpg|thumb|250px|The central [[Gare d'Orléans]] – The station concourse]]
Orléans is served by two main railway stations: the central [[Gare d'Orléans]] and the [[Gare des Aubrais-Orléans]], in the northern suburbs.

One can admire its frontage from the entrance in the rue de la Bretonnerie. Yet, the building – which sheltered the highest figures of the kingtom passing by the city, and maybe some kings themselves (Henri IV, Louis XIII, Louis XIV of France) – can easily be observed from its gardens, opened to the public (entrance rue d'Alsace-Lorraine).
* The ''hôtel de la Motte-Sanguin'' (18th century) and its gardens, manor built at the behest of [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans]] (1747–1793), cousin of the King Louis XVI. He was surnamed "Philippe Égalité" / "equality" referring to his support to the 1789 revolutionaries. Nicknamed "''the richest man on earth''" he voted in favour of the death penalty against his own cousin the king [[Louis XVI]]. This is a [[classic style]] princely residence (and even royal, since Philippe Égalité's heir accessed the throne of France under the name of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe Ier]]). It's part of a public park opened to the public (via the Solférino street).

* ''Remains of the [[University of Orléans]]'' (a 15th-century building housing the thesis room), founded in 1306 by [[pope Clement V]], in which, among many other great historical figures, the Protestant [[John Calvin]] studied and taught. The University was so famous that it attracted students from all over Europe, particularly Germany. The city of Orléans is one of the cradles of Protestantism.
* The ''House of Louis XI'' (end of the 15th century), on Saint-Aignan square. Built at the behest of the king, who particularly revered [[Aignan of Orleans|Saint Aignan]].<ref>J. DEBAL, Orléans : Une Ville, Une Histoire</ref>

While boats could not sail on the river Seine because of the windings, they could sail to Orléans on the Loire river with the wind in their back. Then the merchandise was brought to Paris by roadways. Wine, and sugar from the colonies, were shipped to Orléans where they were stored and refined. Vinegar is still a city' speciality due to the lapsing of wine stocks during the shipment. One can admire the old pavement of the docks (18th and 19th centuries) on the north bank of the river in the city and on the island in the middle, that was used to channel the water

Built between 1751 and 1760, at the request of [[Daniel-Charles Trudaine]], administrator and [[civil engineer]].

• Many historical houses and mansions (hundreds) can still be admired in the city center which is one of the largest in France due to the great importance of the city until the 20th century. The historical center dating back to the 15th century extends far beyond the limits of the pedestrian sector that has been extensively restored in the past few years. In fact it corresponds to the portion of the modern city which is enclosed by the Boulevards. Many historical monuments remain in the non-pedestrian sectors of the city (for example, at rue Notre-Dame-de-Recouvrance, at rue des Carmes, at rue de la Bretonnerie, at Square Saint-Aignan).
