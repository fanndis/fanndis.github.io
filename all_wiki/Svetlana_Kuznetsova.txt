'''Svetlana Aleksandrovna Kuznetsova''' ({{lang-rus|Светла́на Алекса́ндровна Кузнецо́ва|p=svʲɪtˈlanə ɐlʲɪkˈsandrəvnə kʊznʲɪˈtsovə|a=Svetlana_kuznetsova.ogg}}; born 27 June 1985) is a Russian professional tennis player. She has appeared in four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles finals, winning two, and has also appeared in seven doubles finals, winning twice. As a doubles player, Kuznetsova has reached the finals of each [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] event at least once, winning the [[Australian Open]] twice.

Born to an athletic family, Kuznetsova moved at the age of seven to Spain to attend the Sanchez-Casal Academy. In 2001, she first took part in a WTA tournament, the [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Madrid Open]], and a year later won her first WTA title at the [[Nordea Nordic Light Open]] in Helsinki, Finland. Her first appearance in a Grand Slam tournament was at the [[2002 Australian Open – Women's Singles|2002 Australian Open]] and her first Grand Slam title came at the [[2004 US Open – Women's Singles|2004 US Open]] over countrywoman [[Elena Dementieva]], making her the third Russian woman to win a Grand Slam title, after [[Anastasia Myskina]] and [[Maria Sharapova]]. Kuznetsova's second Grand Slam title was the [[2009 French Open]], defeating compatriot [[Dinara Safina]] in the final in straight sets. At the [[2006 French Open]] and the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]] singles tournament she was the runner-up, both times to [[Belgium|Belgian]] player [[Justine Henin]]. As a result, Kuznetsova obtained a career-high No. 2 WTA ranking, holding that position for 24 weeks in 2007 and 2008. Since the [[2010 WTA Tour|2010]] season, Kuznetsova lost her top 10 position and even dropped down to a year-end ranking of 72 in [[2012 WTA Tour|2012]], until recovering in [[2016 WTA Tour|2016]], when she progressed to the top ten and reached the semifinals of the [[2016 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]], her best result in that tournament to date.

Apart from singles tournaments, Kuznetsova was also successful in doubles. She won her first five WTA doubles titles with [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]]. After a series of disappointing results with her she paired with [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Elena Likhovtseva]], [[Alicia Molik]], and [[Amélie Mauresmo]]. Pairing with Likhovtseva, she climbed to No. 3 in doubles in 2004, holding that position for eight weeks, which remains her career-high. She won the Australian Open twice in doubles, in [[2005 Australian Open – Women's Doubles|2005]] alongside Alicia Molik and in [[2012 Australian Open – Women's Doubles|2012]] partnering [[Vera Zvonareva]]. Kuznetsova also played various times mixed doubles events, most prominently in 2003, but never went beyond the quarterfinals. She has won a total of 18 [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] singles and 16 WTA doubles titles to date.

==Early life==
Svetlana Aleksandrovna Kuznetsova was born in [[Leningrad]]. Her father, Aleksandr Kuznetsov, has coached five Olympic and world cycling champions.

Kuznetsova never showed interest in cycling, but rather tennis. She later stated in an interview that she liked watching tennis from an early age, preferring men's over women's tennis. "I had posters in my room of MaliVai Washington, Marcelo Ríos, and (Yevgeny) Kafelnikov. It's very weird but this is who I liked. Later I was a big fan of (Marat) Safin.", she said. Kuznetsova began to play tennis at the age of seven, and moved to Spain six years later to receive better training and coaching. While there, she became fluent in Spanish.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/brian-viner-interviews-svetlana-kuznetsova-lsquoin-britain-the-first-girl-who-hits-two-balls-in--they-give-her-everythingrsquo-850667.html |title=Brian Viner interviews Svetlana Kuznetsova: ‘In Britain the first girl who hits two balls in – they give her everything’ – Tennis – Sport |newspaper=The Independent |date=20 June 2008 |access-date=26 June 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

She lost her opening match again at [[2015 Australian Open|Melbourne]], losing to [[Caroline Garcia]].

Kuznetsova scored her first win of the year at the Fed Cup, where she defeated world No. 8 Agnieszka Radwańska. However, Kuznetsova's hard-court season was disappointing, with her biggest win against 15th-ranked Angelique Kerber in [[2015 Miami Open|Miami]].

She started the clay season at the International tournament [[2015 Prague Open|Prague Open]], where she lost to 98th-ranked Zhang Shuai, but renewed herself at the [[2015 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid Open]], where she reached her 35th final.

She lost to Petra Kvitová in the final in straight sets. Kuznetsova reached the second round of [[2015 French Open|Roland Garros]], losing there to long-time rival Francesca Schiavone in three tricky sets, 7–6, 5–7, 8–10.

Kuznetsova played a steady grass season, with a win–loss of 6–3, the second-best result judged by wins in her career on grass. She reached the second round of Wimbledon for the first time since 2011. Kuznetsova withdrew from most of the North America tournaments, including the Rogers Cup and Cincinnati, due to a left leg injury. At the US Open, she lost in the first round to [[Kristina Mladenovic]]. Kuznetsova renewed herself in [[2015 Guangzhou International Women's Open – Singles|Guangzhou]], reaching the quarterfinals. She eventually received her first trophy this season at the [[2015 Kremlin Cup|Kremlin Cup]] with a straight sets victory over [[Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova]] in the final, becoming the 15th title in her career.

===2016: Miami Open final; return to the top 10; WTA Finals semifinal===
Svetlana repeated her season start. In [[2016 ASB Classic – Women's Singles|Auckland]] she reached the second round where she was knocked out by [[Tamira Paszek]]. She then triumphed in [[2016 Apia International Sydney – Women's Singles|Sydney]], defeating top-seeded Halep in the semifinals in three tight sets, and qualifier [[Monica Puig]] from Puerto Rico in the finals in two sets.

At the [[2016 Australian Open|Australian Open]], seeded No. 23, she reached the second round, where she lost surprisingly to returning [[Kateryna Bondarenko]] from Ukraine.

Seeded 8th at the [[2016 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai Tennis Championships]], Kuznetsova suffered a shocking demolition by [[Julia Görges]] in the first round. Kuznetsova then traveled to Doha for the [[2016 Qatar Total Open|Qatar Open]]. She was seeded 12th and was drawn to face Julia Görges in the first round for consecutive tournaments. However, this time Svetlana won in straight sets but lost out to [[Jeļena Ostapenko]] in the second round.

At the [[2016 BNP Paribas Open|BNP Paribas Open]], Svetlana was seeded 16th and received a bye into the second round. However, she suffered a loss to CoCo Vandeweghe.

Kuznetsova reached the quarterfinals of the [[2016 Italian Open|Italian Open]], where she suffered a clear loss by Serena Williams. As a result, she jumped four ranking positions, to No.15. On 15 April, Kuznetsova replaced Sharapova from the top position among Russian players, the first time since 2011.<ref>[http://www.championat.com/tennis/article-247948-sharapova-i-ferrer-vyleteli-iz-desjatki.html Впервые с 2011 года Шарапова не является первой ракеткой России]</ref>

The Russian reached the fourth round in singles at the [[2016 French Open|French Open]], losing to eventual champion Garbiñe Muguruza. In doubles, she partnered with [[Margarita Gasparyan]] to reach the semifinals. This became her best Grand Slam doubles result since 2012 Australian Open, and her best French Open doubles result since 2004. By reaching the fourth round of the [[2016 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], where she lost to Serena Williams, she ensured herself a place in the top ten for the first time since 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/notes-netcords-july-11-2016 | title=Notes & Netcords: July 11, 2016 | publisher=WTA | access-date=8 September 2019 }}</ref> Then at the [[2016 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]], the Russian reached the quarterfinal where she was beaten by Halep.

Kuznetsova qualified to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in singles and doubles. In doubles she should have partner with Gasparyan, but the young tennis player cited her injury; she was replaced by [[Daria Kasatkina]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.championat.com/tennis/news-2519430-myskina-hoteli-chtoby-na-igrah-sygral-duet-kuznecovagasparjan-no-u-rity-travma.html|title=Мыскина: хотели, чтобы на Играх сыграл дуэт Кузнецова/Гаспарян, но у Риты травма|date=14 July 2016|publisher=Championat.com|language=ru|trans-title=Myskina: we wanted Kuznetsova and Gasparyan to play doubles at the Olympics, but Rita has been injured|access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref> Kuznetsova reached the third round in singles and the quarterfinal in doubles. She again reached the quarterfinal in a Premier 5 tournament, doing so in [[2016 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati]]. At the [[2016 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Kuznetsova suffered a disappointing loss against resurgent Caroline Wozniacki despite leading 4–0 in the first set.

Kuznetsova rebounded at the [[2016 Wuhan Open|Wuhan Open]], reaching the semifinals which boosted her hopes to qualify for the WTA Finals for the first time since 2009. This run included defeating defending champion Venus Williams and Agnieszka Radwańska, after saving match point.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/5935620/title/kuznetsova-continues-mastery-of-radwanska-to-reach-wuhan-sfs-boosts-singapore-hopes|title=Kuznetsova Continues Mastery Of Radwanska To Reach Wuhan SFs, Boosts Singapore Hopes|website=Women's Tennis Association|access-date=22 October 2016}}</ref> She then lost to fellow Singapore contender Dominika Cibulková in a tight three set match. At the [[2016 China Open (tennis)|China Open]], Kuznetsova received a bye into the second round due to her impressive performance at Wuhan. She defeated [[Misaki Doi]] but lost to yet another Singapore Contender Madison Keys in the third round. Being the favourite for the title in [[2016 Tianjin Open|Tianjin]] after top seed Agnieszka Radwańska withdrew from her quarterfinal match, Kuznetsova disappointingly lost to [[Alison Riske]] in the semifinals. This would have kept her out of Singapore, until Serena Williams withdrew from Singapore and that left a spot up to grabs.

As the defending champion, Kuznetsova took a wildcard into the [[2016 Kremlin Cup|Kremlin Cup]], knowing that she had to win the title to qualify for Singapore. Kuznetsova handled the pressure well; defeating [[Alizé Cornet]], [[Tímea Babos]], [[Elina Svitolina]] and [[Daria Gavrilova]] in the final to win the title. This win automatically took the place in the last spot at [[2016 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]] for the first time since 2009 and also meant that Kuznetsova managed to successfully defend a title for the first time in her career. In the [[2016 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]] she defeated Radwanska and Pliskova in 3 sets before losing to [[Garbiñe Muguruza]] to top her group. She then lost to eventual champion [[Dominika Cibulkova]]

===2017: Indian Wells final, steady top-10 ranking in mid-season===
Kuznetsova as fifth seeded started well at the [[2017 Brisbane International|Brisbane International]], reaching the quarterfinals but losing there to Muguruza. She lost in the second round of the [[2017 Apia International Sydney|Sydney Open]] to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in two straight sets. At the [[2017 Australian Open|Australian Open]] she got into the fourth round, her best result there since 2013, but lost again to Pavlyuchenkova in two straight sets.

Her disappointing season continued at the [[2017 St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy|St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy]] as she crashed out in her first quarterfinal of the year against [[Yulia Putintseva]], the eventual finalist. Kuznetsova then skipped both the [[2017 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai Tennis Championships]] and the [[2017 Qatar Total Open|Qatar Open]] due to an injury.

Her first tournament back from the injury, she won her opening round match at the [[2017 BNP Paribas Open|BNP Paribas Open]] against [[Johanna Larsson]], before following it up with impressive victories over Roberta Vinci, Caroline Garcia, taking revenge for her two losses this year against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and then earned an excellent victory over the in-form [[Karolína Plíšková]] to reach her first final at Indian Wells since 2008 - she ultimately ended up losing to compatriot Elena Vesnina in three sets. She then lost to Venus Williams in the fourth round at the Miami event.

Kuznetsova's first clay court event of the year came at the [[2017 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] where she was the eighth seed and the title favourite. However, she failed to capitalize on her chances as she fell to eventual champion local wildcard [[Laura Siegemund]], who eventually went on to unexpectedly clinch the title. She then reached the semifinals of the [[2017 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid Open]], losing to Mladenovic. As a result, she climbed to the eighth world ranking position. However, after a disappointing performance in [[2017 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Rome]], Kuznetsova returned to the 9th position. At the [[2017 French Open|French Open]], Kuznetsova defended her points as she went to the fourth round, losing there to Wozniacki.

The results from the grass court season were one of the best in Kuznetsova's career, producing a win-loss record of 6–2, repeating the 2005 record. She reached the quarterfinals of [[2017 Aegon International Eastbourne|Eastbourne]], losing to Pliskova in three sets. She then improved her performance at [[2017 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], defeating [[Ons Jabeur]], Ekaterina Makarova, [[Polona Hercog]] and No. 10 Agnieszka Radwanska on her way to reach the quarterfinals, where she fell to eventual champion Garbiñe Muguruza. She was once again beaten by Muguruza in [[2017 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati]], but now in three tight sets.

By the end of the season, Kuznetsova showed low results due to her hand injury, twice losing in the second round in a total of three tournaments, after receiving a bye. She withdrew from the [[2017 Kremlin Cup|Kremlin Cup]], where she was the two-times defending champion.<ref>[https://www.championat.com/tennis/news-2927038-kuznecova-ne-sygraet-na-vtb-kubke-kremlja-iz-za-travmy-kisti.html Кузнецова не выступит на «ВТБ Кубке Кремля» из-за травмы кисти]</ref> On 23 October, she fell out of the top-10 and dropped to the 11th position,<ref>[https://www.championat.com/tennis/news-2934120-kuznecova-pokinula-top-10-sharapova-opustilas-na-60-ju-strochku.html Кузнецова покинула топ-10, Шарапова опустилась на 60-ю строчку]</ref> ending her 65 weeks streak in the top 10.

===2018: Decline and comeback in Washington D.C.===
Kuznetsova continued her poor performance on court. She reached a quarterfinal only once in an International event in Istanbul. Even at Roland Garros, where she has been traditionally playing well, Kuznetsova lost in the first round to world No. 3 Garbine Muguruza. After her first-round loss in [[2018 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Kuznetsova pulled out of the top 100. However, she rebounded herself winning the [[2018 Citi Open|Citi Open]] in Washington D.C., defeating [[Donna Vekic]] in three sets. By that, she extended her tournament's record to 11–0. Furthermore, she returned to the top 100 after this success;<ref>[http://www.wtatennis.com/news/kuznetsova-claims-washington-title-comeback-over-vekic Kuznetsova claims Washington title with comeback over Vekic]</ref> however, after her loss at [[2018 Western & Southern Open|Cincy]], she dropped just outside the top 100. She finished the season ranked 107, her worst ranking since 2001.

===2019: Comeback after injury===
After half a year off battling injury, Kuznetsova made a comeback at the [[2019 Ladies Open Lugano|Ladies Open Lugano]], reaching the quarterfinals.<ref>[https://www.wtatennis.com/news/kuznetsova-kicks-comeback-alexandrova-win-lugano Kuznetsova kicks off comeback with Alexandrova win in Lugano]</ref> One of her best results in the European swing a win over world No. 10 [[Aryna Sabalenka]] at the [[2019 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid Open]].

Kuznetsova could not defend her title at the [[2019 Citi Open|Citi Open]] in Washington D.C., after she was granted a visa too late, although she applied in February.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2019/07/25/svetlana-kuznetsova-unable-defend-washington-title-due-us-visa/|title=Svetlana Kuznetsova unable to defend Washington title due to 'US visa problems'|author=Charlie Eccleshare|website=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> This led to her losing 90 ranking positions, from 108 to 198. In the U.S. swing, Kuznetsova reached the third round of the [[2019 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]], losing to [[Simona Halep]] in straight sets. Ranked 153 and earning a wild card, Kuznetsova reached the final at the following [[2019 Western & Southern Open – Women's Singles|Western & Southern Open]], defeating 11th seeded [[Anastasija Sevastova]], [[Dayana Yastremska]], eighth seeded [[Sloane Stephens]], third seeded [[Karolína Plíšková]] and top-seeded [[Ashleigh Barty]]. She was defeated by [[Madison Keys]]. As a result, Kuznetsova went from No. 153 to No. 62 in the world ranking, her first top 100 position since 13 May 2019. At the [[2019 US Open – Women's Singles|U.S. Open]], she was defeated in the first round by [[Kristie Ahn]]. She successfully qualified at [[2019 Wuhan Open – Singles|Wuhan]], defeating wildcard Zheng Qinwen and [[Bethanie Mattek-Sands]], and defeated [[Yulia Putintseva]] and [[Hsieh Su-wei]], before falling in the third round to [[Elina Svitolina]]. At [[2019 China Open – Women's Singles|Beijing]], Kuznetsova was defeated by [[Christina McHale]] in the first round in three sets. Kuznetsova's final event of the year was at [[2019 Kremlin Cup – Women's Singles|Moscow]], where she was defeated in the first round by eventual semifinalist [[Karolína Muchová]]. She ended the year ranked No. 54.

===2020: Return to form===
At [[2020 Hobart International – Singles|Hobart]], Kuznetsova lost in two tight sets to [[Magda Linette]]. She then participated in the [[2020 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]] for the first time in three years, where she defeated [[Markéta Vondroušová]] in the first round, before falling to [[Camila Giorgi]]. At [[2020 St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy – Singles|St. Petersburg]], she defeated [[Jennifer Brady]] before losing to [[Belinda Bencic]]. At [[2020 Qatar Total Open – Singles|Doha]], she defeated [[Çağla Büyükakçay]] and [[Iga Świątek]], received a walkover from [[Amanda Anisimova]], and then defeated Bencic in straight sets to reach the semifinal, where she lost to eventual champion [[Aryna Sabalenka]]. Despite the loss, her ranking rose to No. 32 in the world, and she was due to be seeded for the first time in years at [[2020 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]], before the tournament was cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

==Rivalries==
===Kuznetsova vs. Henin===
Belgian tennis legend [[Justine Henin]] was one of Kuznetsova's leading rivals during the middle portion of her career. Of the 19 matches that they played, Kuznetsova earned three victories, including their final one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/head2head/player1/4467/player2/3541|title=Head 2 Head – WTA Tennis English|work=Women's Tennis Association}}</ref>  Henin won their first meeting in the [[2003 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|2003 Wimbledon Quarterfinal]] when Kuznetsova, just 17, lost in straight sets. Kuznetsova earned her first win over the Belgian at the semifinals of the 2004 Total Qatar Open, where she went on to lose in the final to [[Anastasia Myskina]]. This result projected the Russian into the world's top 20 players for the first time. Arguably their finest match followed in the fourth round of the [[2005 French Open]], where Henin saved two match points en route to a three set victory.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/30/sports/30iht-TENNIS.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |title=French Open: Henin-Hardenne has a great escape |last1= Clarey |first1=Christopher |date=31 May 2005 |work=New York Times |access-date=6 June 2013}}</ref> Henin went on to win the tournament, defending her title a year later by beating Kuznetsova in the [[2006 French Open|2006]] final.
