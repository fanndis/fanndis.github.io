==Background and release==
{{quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=I wouldn't have released a film just for the sake of self documentation. I wanted it to express what I believe to be true about life – that it's not random, that everything has a reason and that we need to be conscious of life's little clues and how the dots all connect or we miss out.|source= —Beyoncé Knowles, press release<ref name="press">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/life-is-but-a-dream-to-be-released-on-dvd-on-november-25-worldwide-230249951.html|title="Life Is But A Dream" To Be Released On DVD On November 25 Worldwide|website=PR Newswire/Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records|date=November 1, 2013|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref>}}

The project was the culmination of an entire career's worth of archive footage and photographs kept in a digital storage room in Knowles' offices. Since 2005 Knowles hired a "visual director" to film her life,<ref name="GQ">{{cite web|title=Miss Millennium: Beyoncé|url=https://www.gq.com/women/photos/201301/beyonce-cover-story-interview-gq-february-2013|work=[[GQ]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]]|first=Amy|last=Wallace|date=February 2013|page=1 and 2|accessdate=February 15, 2013}}</ref> and also used a video camera on her personal computer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oprah Winfrey and Beyonce Knowles join forces on the red carpet|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21427025|work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=February 15, 2013}}</ref>

Knowles is known for insisting on privacy, and the media hailed the film as a rare glimpse into her private life. This included documenting the events of her marriage to [[Jay-Z]], her miscarriage, birth of daughter Blue Ivy, as well as her professional split from her father and manager [[Mathew Knowles]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Beyoncé Knowles:  The Queen B|url=http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/beyonce-knowles-the-queen-b/|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|date=February 11, 2013|first=Jason|last=Gay|accessdate=February 15, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214161721/http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/beyonce-knowles-the-queen-b/|archive-date=December 14, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Knowles addressed this in an interview with ''[[GQ]]'' magazine, saying "I always battle with: How much do I reveal about myself? How do I keep my humility? How do I keep my spirit and the reality? And how do I continue to be generous to — to my fans and to my craft? And how do I stay current? But how do I stay soulful? And it is the battle of my life. When I walk into a stage I'm able to come out of my shell and be as fabulous and over the top and strong and powerful as I want to be."<ref name="GQ" />
