'''Codependency''' is a relationship imbalance where one person [[Enabling|enables]] another person's [[addiction]], poor [[mental health]], immaturity, irresponsibility, or under-achievement.<ref name="BPDFamily">{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=R. Skip|title=Codependency and Codependent Relationships |url=http://bpdfamily.com/content/codependency-codependent-relationships|publisher=[[BPDFamily.com]]|date=13 July 2014|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> Among the core characteristics of codependency is an excessive reliance on other people for approval and a sense of identity.<ref name="BPDFamily"/> Definitions of codependency vary, but it is generally defined as a subclinical, situational, and/or episodic behavioral condition similar to that of [[dependent personality disorder]]. The term is less individually diagnostic and more descriptive of a relationship dynamic.<ref name="BPDFamily"/>

==History==
The idea of codependency may have its roots in the theories of German psychoanalyst [[Karen Horney]]. In 1941, she proposed that some people adopt what she termed a "Moving Toward" personality style to overcome their basic anxiety. Essentially, these people move toward others by gaining their approval and affection, and subconsciously control them through their dependent style. They are unselfish, virtuous, martyr-like, faithful, and turn the other cheek despite personal humiliation. Approval from others is more important than respecting themselves.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rotunda, Ph.D|first1=Robert J.|title=Codependency|url=http://uwf.edu/rrotunda/psych/pco4310/hands-on-codependent.html|publisher=University of West Florida}}</ref>

==Definition==
"Dependency" is well-established in psychological literature.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} Early [[psychoanalytic theory]] emphasized the oral character and structural basis of dependency, [[social learning theory]] considers a tendency to be acquired by learning and experience, and [[Attachment Theory|ethological attachment theory]] posits that attachment or affectional bonding is the basis for dependency.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} 

===Codependency===
Timmen Cermak, M.D., proposed that co-dependency be listed as a personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R; [[American Psychiatric Association]], 1987). Cermak reasoned that when specific personality traits become excessive and maladaptive and cause significant impairment in functioning or cause significant distress, it warrants a personality disorder diagnosis. Cermak's definition was published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs in 1986.<ref name="cermak"/>

Cermak proposed the following criteria for this disorder:<ref name="cermak"/> 
# Continued investment of [[self-esteem]] in the ability to control both oneself and others in the face of serious adverse consequences. 
# Assumption of responsibility for meeting others' needs to the exclusion of acknowledging one's own. 
# Anxiety and boundary distortions relative to intimacy and separation. 
# [[Enmeshment]] in relationships with personality disordered, chemically dependent, other co‐dependent, or impulse‐disordered individuals.
# Three or more of the following:
## Excessive reliance on denial
## Constriction of emotions (with or without dramatic outbursts)
## [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] 
## [[Hypervigilance]] 
## Compulsions
## [[Anxiety]] 
## [[Substance abuse]] 
## Has been (or is) the victim of recurrent physical or sexual abuse 
## Stress related medical illnesses
## Has remained in a primary relationship with an active substance abuser for at least two years without seeking outside help.

Codependency has not been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; DSM-III-R or later versions.

===Dependent personality disorder===
[[Dependent personality disorder]] is included in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]. The definition and criteria have changed in the different versions of the DSM. In the DSM-I, passive dependency personality was characterized by helplessness, denial, and indecisiveness, and was considered a subtype of passive-aggressive personality. By DSM-IV, there were nine criteria with an essential feature of a pervasive or lifetime pattern of dependent and submissive behavior. The DSM-IV definition emphasized the excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissive and clinging behavior and fear of separation.<ref name=sperry>{{cite book|last1=Sperry, M.D., Ph.D|first1=Len|title=Handbook of Diagnosis and Treatment of DSM-IV Personality Disorders|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|location=Kentucky|isbn=9780415935692|page=108}}</ref> 

==Behaviors and characteristics==
===Individual dynamics===
A codependent is someone who cannot function on their own and whose thinking and behavior is instead organized around another person, process, or substance.<ref name="dummies">{{cite book|last1=Lancer|first1=Darlene|title=Codependency for Dummies|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-1118095225|page=30|edition=1st|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118095227}}</ref> Many codependents place a lower priority on their own needs, while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others. Codependency can occur in any type of relationship, including family, work, friendship, and also romantic, peer or community relationships.<ref name="patterns">[http://www.coda.org/tools4recovery/Patterns2-2011.htm Codependents Anonymous: Patterns and Characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824075736/http://www.coda.org/tools4recovery/Patterns2-2011.htm |date=2013-08-24 }}</ref>

===Romantic relationship dynamics===
Some codependents often find themselves in relationships where their primary role is that of rescuer, supporter, and confidante. These helper types are often dependent on the other person's poor functioning to satisfy their own emotional needs.<ref name="BPDFamily"/>

Codependent relationships are marked by intimacy problems, dependency, control (including caretaking), denial, dysfunctional communication and [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]], and high reactivity. Often, there is imbalance, so one person is abusive or in control or supports or enables another person's addiction, poor mental health, immaturity, irresponsibility, or under-achievement.<ref name="lancer">{{cite book|last1=Lancer|first1=Darlene|title=Conquering Shame and Codependency: 8 Steps to Freeing the True You|date=2014|publisher=Hazelden|location=Minnesota|isbn=978-1-61649-533-6|pages=63–65}}</ref> 

Commonly observable characteristics of codependency are:<ref name="BPDFamily"/><ref>[http://winning-teams.com/definitions.html Winning Teams: Definitions in Psychology], Dr. David Thomas PhD</ref>
* intense and unstable interpersonal relationships
* [[Attachment_theory#Anxious-ambivalent_attachment|inability to tolerate being alone, accompanied by frantic efforts to avoid being alone]]
* [[autophobia]]
* chronic feelings of [[boredom]] and [[emptiness]]
* subordinating one's own needs to those of the person with whom one is involved
* [[Limerence|overwhelming desire]] for acceptance and affection
* [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]]
* [[Control freak|over-controlling]]
* [[Locus_of_control|external referencing]]
* dishonesty and denial
* [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]]
* lack of [[Trust (emotion)|trust]]
* low [[self-worth]]
* [[victim mentality]]

In a codependent relationship, the codependent person's sense of purpose is based on making extreme sacrifices to satisfy their partner's needs. Codependent relationships signify a degree of unhealthy "clinginess" and needy behavior, where one person does not have [[self-sufficiency]] or [[autonomy]]. One or both parties depend on their loved one for fulfillment.<ref name=webmd>{{cite web|last1=Wetzler, PhD|first1=Scott|title=Psychology division chief at Albert Einstein College of Medicine|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/signs-of-a-codependent-relationship|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref> The mood and emotions of the codependent are often determined by how they think other individuals perceive them (especially loved ones). This perception is self-inflicted and often leads to clingy, needy behavior which can hurt the health of the relationship.<ref name=Rick>{{cite web|last1=Reynolds|first1=Rick|title=Why Is Codependency A Serious Problem For Relationships?|url=https://www.reignitethefire.net/codependency-serious-problem-relationships/|date=2014-08-19}}</ref>
Particularly problematic pairings include:

:'''[[Personality disorder]] and codependent pairing''' 
:*[[Borderline personality disorder]] – there is a tendency for loved ones of people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) to slip into "caretaker" roles, giving priority and focus to problems in the life of the person with BPD rather than to issues in their own lives. Further, the codependent may gain a sense of worth by being "the sane one" or "the responsible one".<ref name=Danielle>{{cite web|last1=Danielle|first1=Alicia|title=Codependency and Borderline Personality Disorder: How to Spot It|url=http://www.borderlinepersonalitytreatment.com/codependency-and-borderline-personality-disorder-how-to-spot-it.html|publisher=Clearview Women's Center|accessdate=5 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207072107/http://www.borderlinepersonalitytreatment.com/codependency-and-borderline-personality-disorder-how-to-spot-it.html|archive-date=7 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Family dynamics===
In the [[dysfunctional family]] the child learns to become attuned to the parent's needs and feelings instead of the other way around.<ref name="lancer"/> Parenting is a role that requires a certain amount of self-sacrifice and giving a child's needs a high priority. A parent can, nevertheless, be codependent towards their own children if the caretaking or parental sacrifice reaches unhealthy or destructive levels.<ref name="patterns"/> Generally, a parent who takes care of their own needs (emotional and physical) in a healthy way will be a better caretaker, whereas a codependent parent may be less effective, or may even do harm to a child.<ref name="patterns"/> Codependent relationships often manifest through enabling behaviors, especially between parents and their children.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ambrosiatc.com/addiction/codependency/?ambTRK=PR |title=Are You Enabling? |publisher=Ambrosia Treatment Center |access-date=14 August 2017|date=2016-02-11 }}</ref> Another way to look at it is that the needs of an infant are necessary but temporary, whereas the needs of the codependent are constant. Children of codependent parents who ignore or negate their own feelings may become codependent.

==Recovery and prognosis==
Not all mental health professionals agree about standard methods of treatment.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1300/J023v03n03_05 |title=On Terms Used and Abused: The Concept of 'Codependency' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjyJ3QWJgPQC&pg=PA113 |year=1989 |last1=Gomberg |first1=Edith S Lisansky |editor1-first=Edith S |editor1-last=Gomberg |journal=Drugs & Society |volume=3 |issue=3–4 |pages=113–32 |isbn=978-0-86656-965-1}}</ref> Caring for an individual with a physical addiction is not necessarily treating a pathology. The caregiver may only require [[assertiveness]] skills and the ability to place responsibility for the addiction on the other.<ref name="alcoholism"/><ref name="affleck"/> There are various [[Recovery model|recovery]] paths for individuals who struggle with codependency. For example, some may choose cognitive-behavioral [[psychotherapy]], sometimes accompanied by chemical therapy for accompanying depression. There also exist support groups for codependency, such as Co-Dependents Anonymous (CoDA), [[Al-Anon/Alateen]], [[Nar-Anon]], and [[Adult Children of Alcoholics]] (ACoA), which are based on the [[twelve-step program]] model of Alcoholics Anonymous and [[Celebrate Recovery]], a Christian, Bible-based group.<ref name="COLLET1990">{{cite journal |last=Collet |first=L |year=1990 |title=After the anger, what then? ACOA: Self-help or self-pity? |journal=Family Therapy Networker |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=22–31}}</ref> Many self-help guides have been written on the subject of codependency.

Sometimes an individual can, in attempts to recover from codependency, go from being overly passive or overly giving to being overly [[aggressive]] or excessively [[selfish]].<ref name="alcoholism"/> Many therapists maintain that finding a balance through healthy assertiveness (which leaves room for being a caring person and also engaging in healthy caring behavior) is true recovery from codependency and that becoming extremely selfish, a [[bullying|bully]], or an otherwise conflict-addicted person is not.<ref name="alcoholism"/><ref name="affleck">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.55.1.29 |title=Causal attribution, perceived benefits, and morbidity after a heart attack: An 8-year study |year=1987 |last1=Affleck |first1=Glenn |last2=Tennen |first2=Howard |last3=Croog |first3=Sydney |last4=Levine |first4=Sol |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=55 |pages=29–35 |pmid=3571655 |issue=1}}</ref> Developing a permanent stance of being a victim (having a [[victim mentality]]) would also not constitute true recovery from codependency and could be another example of going from one extreme to another.<ref name="alcoholism"/> A victim mentality could also be seen as a part of one's original state of codependency (lack of empowerment causing one to feel like the "subject" of events rather than being an empowered actor).<ref name="alcoholism"/> Someone truly recovered from codependency would feel empowered and like an author of their life and actions rather than being at the mercy of outside forces.<ref name="alcoholism"/> A victim mentality may also occur in combination with [[passive–aggressive]] control issues.<ref name="alcoholism"/> From the perspective of moving beyond victim-hood, the capacity to forgive and let go (with exception of cases of very severe abuse) could also be signs of real recovery from codependency, but the willingness to endure further abuse would not.<ref name="alcoholism"/>

Unresolved patterns of codependency can lead to more serious problems like alcoholism, drug addiction, [[eating disorders]], [[sex addiction]], psychosomatic illnesses, and other [[self-destructive]] or [[self-defeating personality disorder|self-defeating behaviors]].<ref name="cd">"Codependence", in: Benjamin J. Sadock & Virginia A. Sadock (eds), Kaplan & Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry on CD, Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 7th ed. 2000, {{ISBN|0-7817-2141-5}}, {{ISBN|2-07-032070-7}}.</ref> People with codependency are also more likely to attract further abuse from aggressive individuals (such as those with [[Borderline personality disorder|BPD]] or [[Narcissistic personality disorder|NPD]]), more likely to stay in stressful jobs or relationships, less likely to seek medical attention when needed and are also less likely to get promotions and tend to earn less money than those without codependency patterns.<ref name="cd"/> For some people, the social insecurity caused by codependency can progress into full-blown [[social anxiety]] disorders like [[Specific social phobia|social phobia]], [[avoidant personality disorder]] or painful [[shyness]].<ref name="cd"/> Other stress-related disorders like [[panic disorder]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] or [[PTSD]] may also be present.<ref name="cd"/>

==Controversy==
While Timmen Cermak, M.D., proposed that co-dependency be listed as a personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R; American Psychiatric Association, 1987), it was not accepted by the committee and, as such, no medical consensus exists on the definition of codependency.<ref name="BPDFamily"/> 

With no definition, the term is easily applicable to many behaviors and has been overused by some [[self-help]] authors and support communities.<ref name= kaminer>{{cite web |last1=Kaminer |first1=Wendy |year=1990 |title=Chances Are You're Codependent Too |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/11/books/chances-are-you-re-codependent-too.html }}</ref>

Some clinicians think that the term ''codependency'' has been overused by the general populace and labeling a patient as codependent can be confusing and may even shame them rather than help them focus on how their traumas shape their current relationships.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pikiewicz |first1=Kristi |title="Codependent" No More? |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/meaningful-you/201307/codependent-no-more }}</ref>

Codependency is a theory. There is no evidence that codependence is caused by a disease process.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Taboo topics in addiction treatment.
