==History==
Asia Times Online was created early in 1999 as a successor in "publication policy and editorial outlook" to the print newspaper ''Asia Times'', owned by [[Sondhi Limthongkul]], a [[Thailand|Thai]] [[media mogul]] and leader of the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]], who later sold his business. 

The new publishing company is Asia Times Holdings Limited,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trademarks.justia.com/863/28/asia-86328077.html|title=ASIA TIMES Trademark of Asia Times Online (Holdings) Limited - Registration Number 4691772 - Serial Number 86328077|publisher=Justia Trademarks|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref> incorporated and duly registered in Hong Kong.
Many reporters from the ''Asia Times'' print edition continued their careers as journalists, and a group of those contributors created ''Asia Times Online'' as a successor to Asia Times.<ref>Duthel: https://books.google.com/books?id=oM3DBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT230&lpg=PT230</ref> The word "Online" is no longer part of the website news portal. Asia Times publishes in English and simplified Chinese.

The site was relaunched with a new logo and design in October 2016 with Uwe Parpart as editor. Other executives include Cecil Ho, former Chief Financial Officer of ReOrient Group Limited.

The site was relaunched in February 2019 with a refreshed web design, multiple languages and a domain name change to asiatimes.com.
