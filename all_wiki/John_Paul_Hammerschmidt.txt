'''John Paul Hammerschmidt''' (May 4, 1922 &ndash; April 1, 2015) was an [[Politics of the United States|American politician]] from the state of [[Arkansas]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Hammerschmidt served for thirteen terms in the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[Arkansas's 3rd congressional district]] located in the northwestern quadrant of his state. He served from 1967 until his retirement in 1993.

In 1974, a nationally [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] year, he secured his fifth term by defeating the then 28-year-old future [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]]. He was also the first Republican elected to the House of Representatives from Arkansas since [[Reconstruction era in the United States|Reconstruction]]. Coincidentally, Hammerschmidt left the House the same month in which Clinton became president.

==Early life and business career==
Born in [[Harrison, Arkansas|Harrison]] in [[Boone County, Arkansas|Boone County]] in northwestern Arkansas, Hammerschmidt was the fourth of five children of the former Junie Mildred Taylor and Arthur Paul Hammerschmidt.<ref name="EOA">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4169|title=John Paul Hammerschmidt (1922–) - Encyclopedia of Arkansas|encyclopedia=Encyclopediaofarkansas.net|accessdate=2015-04-05|quote=John Paul Hammerschmidt was born on May 4, 1922, in Harrison to Arthur Paul and Junie M.

He attended [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]], from 1938 to 1939<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/104290/john-paul-hammerschmidt-dies-at-92|title=John Paul Hammerschmidt Dies at 92|publisher=Arkansasbusiness.com|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref> and the [[University of Arkansas]] in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]] from 1940 to 1941.<ref name="EOA"/>

Hammerschmidt served in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] during [[World War II]]. In 1942, he joined the [[513th Air Control Group|3rd Combat Cargo Group]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] and served in the [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II|China-Burma-India theater]] until the end of the war in 1945. Hammerschmidt received the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] with three [[oak leaf cluster]]s for his service in the war.<ref name="EOA"/>

Hammerschmidt returned to the [[United States]] and attended Oklahoma A&M College (now [[Oklahoma State University]]) at [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]], [[Oklahoma]], from 1945 to 1946, having received a [[Bachelor of Science]] [[Academic degree|degree]].<ref name="bioguide"/> He then entered the [[lumber]] industry, working at the Hammerschmidt Lumber Company, which had been founded by his grandfather, and becoming its president.

Hammerschmidt continued his military service in the [[United States Air Force Reserves]] from 1945 to 1960, and later in the [[District of Columbia Army National Guard |District of Columbia Army Reserves]] from 1977 to 1981.<ref name="bioguide">[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=H000124 "HAMMERSCHMIDT, John Paul"]. ''[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]''. Retrieved April 15, 2015.</ref>

==Political career==
Hammerschmidt was a delegate to the [[Republican National Convention]]s in [[1964 Republican National Convention|1964]], [[1968 Republican National Convention|1968]], [[1972 Republican National Convention|1972]], [[1976 Republican National Convention|1976]], [[1980 Republican National Convention|1980]], [[1984 Republican National Convention|1984]], and [[1988 Republican National Convention|1988]]. He was twice the state chairman of the [[Republican Party of Arkansas]], serving from 1964 to 1966 and again from 2002 to 2004. His successor as chairman in 1966, [[Odell Pollard]] of [[Searcy, Arkansas|Searcy]] in [[White County, Arkansas|White County]], died three weeks before the death of Hammerschmidt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hosting-24809.tributes.com/obituary/print/102276822|title=Odell Pollard|publisher=tributes.com|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}</ref>

In the [[U.S. House election, 1966|1966 election]], Hammerschmidt won the Republican nomination for his 3rd district and then defeated the [[incumbent]] Democrat, [[James William Trimble]], by more than nine thousand votes. He became the first Republican to represent Arkansas in Congress since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Hammerschmidt was elected twelve more times, having served twenty-six years from January 3, 1967 to January 3, 1993, from the [[90th United States Congress|90th Congress]] to the [[102nd United States Congress|102nd Congress]]. He became very popular in his district, even though most of its residents had never been represented by a Republican before. The 3rd has always been a rather [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] district; it has only supported a Democrat for president twice since 1952.

Hammerschmidt would only face another contest anywhere near as close as his initial bid for the seat. In the [[U.S. House election, 1974|1974 election]], he defeated Bill Clinton (then a [[University of Arkansas]] law professor) by only 6,400 votes.<ref>https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30037</ref> Clinton had harshly criticized Hammerschmidt for being one of the few Republicans to stand by [[Richard Nixon]] in the wake of the [[Watergate scandal]]. This election was one of only four in which Democrats received more than one-third of the vote against Hammerschmidt (the others being Hardy Croxton in 1968, Donald Poe in 1970, and the former Clinton associate [[James McDougal]] in 1982).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/ContainerHistory.html?ContainerID=323|title=Our Campaigns - Container Detail Page|work=Ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref> The district reverted to form in 1976, when Hammerschmidt was reelected unopposed.<ref>https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30940</ref> In 1978, Hammerschmidt faced weak opposition from the [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]] [[real estate]] broker William C. Mears and instead had the resources to help the Republican gubernatorial nominee, [[Lynn Lowe|A. Lynn Lowe]], a [[farmer]] from [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]], win in Boone County. Lowe, who also was the state party chairman, lost, however, to Hammerschmidt's former opponent, Bill Clinton, by an approximate margin of 63-37 percent.<ref>''Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report'', October 14, 1978, 2804</ref>

Hammerschmidt was a member of the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism (PCAST) which was organized in September 1989 to review and report on aviation security policy in the light of the sabotage of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] on December 21, 1988.

Hammerschmidt had a conservative voting record on foreign policy and social issues, but a slightly more moderate record on economic issues. He supported an amendment proposing to enact [[Flag Desecration Amendment|Flag Desecration Laws]].

Hammerschmidt was in the Air Force Reserve from 1945 to 1960 and the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] from 1977 to 1981. He was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and a member of the [[American Legion]], [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], [[Shriners]], [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks]], [[Rotary International]], and had alumni status at the Alpha Zeta chapter of the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] [[fraternity]] at the [[University of Arkansas at Fayetteville]]. From 1999 to 2004, he was a trustee of [[Arkansas State University]] at [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]].<ref name="EOA"/>  Hammerschmidt died at the age of 92 of heart and respiratory failure at a hospital in [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]], Arkansas.<ref name="obit">{{cite web|url=http://digital.olivesoftware.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&Type=text/html&Path=ArDemocrat/2015/04/02&ID=Ar00102|title=Ex-lawmaker Hammerschmidt, 92, dies |author=Bowden, Bill|work=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette|accessdate=April 2, 2015|date=April 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/03/us/politics/john-paul-hammerschmidt-congressman-who-defeated-clinton-dies-at-92.html?_r=0|title=John Paul Hammerschmidt, 92, Dies; Congressman Defeated Clinton|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>

==Legacy==
A fellowship at the [[University of Arkansas–Fort Smith|University of Arkansas]] at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] was created in his name to allow a university student to work in the 3rd congressional district office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swtimes.com/news/state-news/john-paul-hammerschmidt-strong-advocate-western-arkansas-dies-92|title=John Paul Hammerschmidt, Strong Advocate For Western Arkansas, Dies at 92|work=Times Record|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>

The [[John Paul Hammerschmidt Federal Building]] near the [[Fayetteville Historic Square]] is home to the Fayetteville office of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas]].

[[Interstate 49 in Arkansas]] is designated as the John Paul Hammerschmidt Highway in northwest Arkansas.

Hammerschmidt was inducted into the [[Arkansas Aviation Historical Society|Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame]] in 1990 by the [[Arkansas Aviation Historical Society]].
