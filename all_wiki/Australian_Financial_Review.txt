'''''The Australian Financial Review''''' (abbreviated to '''the ''AFR''''') is an [[Australia|Australian]] business-focused, [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]] [[daily newspaper]] covering the current business and economic affairs of Australia and the world. The newspaper is based in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]; owned by [[Nine Entertainment Co.|Nine Entertainment Co]] and has been published continuously since its founding in 1951. The paper was initially owned by [[Fairfax Media]] but was sold along with the parent company to Nine Entertainment for AUD$2313.8 million.<ref>Mergermarket - An Acuris company. (n.d''.).

In November 2019, the ''AFR'' reached 2.647 million Australians through both print and digital mediums (Mumbrella).<ref name=M2020 >Mumbrella. (2020).

Retrieved from the Mumbrella website: <nowiki>https://mumbrella.com.au/smh-afr-and-the-age-all-report-audience-growth-in-november-616747</nowiki></ref>

The ''Australian Financial Review'' started as a print-only [[weekly newspaper]] in 1951, before changing to a [[Bi-weekly newspaper|bi-weekly]] in 1961, and a [[daily newspaper]] in 1963. The paper now publishes multiple [[Magazine|magazines]] and a supplementary weekend paper, which was launched in 1995. In that same year, the [https://www.afr.com/ ''AFR'' website] was also released, which helped to expand its readership base across all audiences.

Historically, the ''AFR's'' news articles and editorials favoured [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] ideals, influencing Australian policy debates during the 1970s - 1980s. During the 2000s, the ''AFR'' took on the role of the 'corporate watchdog', scrutinising businesses and the government for foul play and corruption. In more recent years, the ''AFR''<nowiki/>'s editorial stance and news coverage has become more neutral. However, it is still considered moderately [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] in its reporting bias with regards to free market regulation policies, but relatively close to the centre in its political views amongst Australian newspapers.<ref>Crikey. (2007). Crikey Bias-o-meter: The newspapers. Retrieved from the ''Crikey'' website: <nowiki>https://www.crikey.com.au/2007/06/26/crikey-bias-o-meter-the-newspapers/</nowiki></ref>

==History==
The ''Australian Financial Review'' newspaper started as a weekly publication in 1951, published by [[John Fairfax & Sons]]. The paper's main objective was to inform the Australian public on business life and news.<ref name=Doyle >Doyle H. (2001). "[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195515039 Australian Financial Review]". In ''The Oxford Companion to Australian History''. Oxford University Press</ref>

In 1961, the ''AFR'' converted to a bi-weekly, and then established itself as the first daily newspaper by 1963.<ref name=C2014 >Carson, A. (2014). "[https://doi.org/10.1080/10361146.2014.963025 The political economy of the print media and the decline of corporate investigative journalism in Australia]". ''Australian Journal of Political Science'', 49(4), pp.726–742.</ref> Despite other newspapers claiming the title of the first daily national paper, Maxwell Newton was the editor in charge of taking the ''Financial Review'' from a bi-weekly to the first daily national paper.<ref>Goot, M. (2015, November). Fifty years of the Australian. ''Media International Australia incorporating Culture and Policy'', (157), 5+. <nowiki>https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A436233544/AONE?u=usyd&sid=AONE&xid=e17f5c80</nowiki></ref> During 1961-62, the ''AFR's'' primary competitor was The ''Australian Financial Times'', which was in operation for less than 12 months. In the 1960s and 1970s, the ''AFR'' developed a strong readership amongst a specialist business audience due to its neutral stance on domestic government policies.<ref name=Doyle/> In the 1970s, despite the ''AFR's'' reputation as a national business daily, many saw it as the primary competitor for ''The Australian'' given its high proportion of readers in the [[NRS social grade|AB demographic]]. <ref>Goot, M. (2015, November). Fifty years of the Australian. ''Media International Australia incorporating Culture and Policy'', (157), 5+. <nowiki>https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A436233544/AONE?u=usyd&sid=AONE&xid=e17f5c80</nowiki></ref>

In 1995, Fairfax launched the ''Australian Financial Review [[Magazine]]'' in response to its growing readership across a wide-ranging audience.<ref>Nine for Brands. (2020). ''The Australian Financial Review Magazine.'' Retrieved from the Nine for Brands website: <nowiki>https://www.nineforbrands.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AFR-Magazine_2020.pdf</nowiki></ref> The magazine was published to cover topics other than business including [[leisure]], [[politics]], [[travel]], [[Sport|sports]], [[fashion]], and other peripheral topics.<ref>Mumbrella. (2017). ''Australian Financial Review Magazine marks ten years of its watch lift out.'' Retrieved from the Mumbrella website: <nowiki>https://mumbrella.com.au/australian-financial-review-magazine-marks-ten-years-watch-lift-461070</nowiki></ref> In December 2019, the magazine recorded an average issue readership of 326,000.<ref>Roy Morgan (2020).

Retrieved from the Roy Morgan website: www.roymorgan.com/findings/8279-roy-morgan-newspaper-readership-results-december-2019-202002060615</ref> Since its launch in 1995, the ''AFR Magazine'' has won the 'Best Newspaper Inserted Magazine' (2013-2019), 'Newspaper Inserted Brand of the Year' (2019) and Mumbrella's 'Special Issue of the Year' (2019).<ref>Nine for Brands. (2020). ''The Australian Financial Review Magazine.'' Retrieved from the Nine for Brands website: <nowiki>https://www.nineforbrands.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AFR-Magazine_2020.pdf</nowiki></ref> 

The magazine's founding was followed by the launch of the ''AFR''<nowiki/>'s website in the same year, which started as a free online source of financial news.<ref>Muck Rack. (n.d.). ''Australian Financial Review''. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://muckrack.com/media-outlet/ausfinancialreview</nowiki></ref> 

In 1997, the ''AFR'' launched its ''Weekend Edition'' which extended the paper's publications into the weekend, with an explicit focus of targeting the growing readership base by providing news articles outside of the traditional finance setting.<ref>Nine for Brands. (2020). ''The Australian Financial Review Magazine.'' Retrieved from the Nine for Brands website: <nowiki>https://www.nineforbrands.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AFR-Magazine_2020.pdf</nowiki></ref>

In 2016, the ''AFR'' launched mobile and iPad compatible applications to provide its digital subscribers more accessibility to its news platform. This was aimed at allowing cross-platform accessibility without having to download two separate applications across different device platforms.<ref>Samios, Z. (2017). NEWSThe AFR launches news app with cross device accessibility. Retrieved from the Mumbrella website: <nowiki>https://mumbrella.com.au/afr-launches-multi-channel-app-408804</nowiki></ref> The application carries similar features to the website including sections such as: Street Talk and Rear Window. The product management team decided to revamp the app due to the wide uptake of smartphones in the Australian market, and to improve their user-interface experience. The UTS Business School was the launch partner for the app, providing logistical advice on the app's delivery.<ref>The Misfits Media Company. (2016). ''The Australian Financial Review Launched Universal App''. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.bandt.com.au/the-australian-financial-review-launches-universal-app/</nowiki></ref> The app’s subscription price is included in the ‘all premium digital subscription’ bundle.

The ''Australian Financial Review'' has grown its product offerings since its beginnings as a [[finance]] [[newsroom]]. It has consistently been well received by the journalism sector as one of the most high-quality newsrooms across Australia.<ref>Henningham, J. (1996). Journalists’ perceptions of newspaper quality. ''Australian Journalism Review'', 18(1), 13–19.</ref> Since the 2000s, the ''AFR'' has launched ''BOSS'' (magazine for business leadership and strategy) and the ''Sophisticated Traveller'' magazine. In 2019, the ''Australian Financial Review'' recorded double-digit subscriber growth, as it continued to market its newspaper as the driver of Australian businesspeople’s success and ambitions.<ref name=M2020/> In 2020, due to the newspaper company's expansion efforts across different readership bases, the ''AFR'' reached 2.647m Australians a month.<ref name=M2020/>

=== Evolution of Paywall System ===
The ''AFR'' first introduced its [[paywall]] in 2006, charging online users to view its articles – a payment model that had not yet been utilised by any other Australian newspaper firm.<ref>Jackson, S. (2011, November 30). Australian Financial Review lowers its paywall. ''The Australian.'' Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.theaustralian.com.au</nowiki></ref> The switch to a paywall was done because the newspaper company thought it could further monetise its niche business audience who could afford it.<ref>Young, S. (2011). The elite public sphere. In ''How Australia Decides: Election Reporting and the Media'' (pp. 42-60). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511984778.004</ref> Following this change, the ''AFR'' continued to adjust the pricing of its subscription due to low subscriber growth.<ref>Carson, A. (2015). Behind the newspaper paywall – lessons in charging for online content: a comparative analysis of why Australian newspapers are stuck in the purgatorial space between digital and print. ''Media, Culture & Society'', 37(7), 1022–1041. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1177/0163443715591669</nowiki></ref>  

In 2011, it newly introduced a freemium paywall in which only a small portion of articles were free. It has been noted that the ''AFR's'' website locks approximately 86% of its online content behind a paywall, higher than its closest competitor the ''[[National Business Review]]''.<ref>Carson, A. (2015). Behind the newspaper paywall – lessons in charging for online content: a comparative analysis of why Australian newspapers are stuck in the purgatorial space between digital and print. ''Media, Culture & Society'', 37(7), 1022–1041. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1177/0163443715591669</nowiki></ref> This was aimed at increasing its digital readership which in 2011 amounted to 6,000 subscribers.<ref>Burrowes, T. (2011). A decade on, AFR has 6711 subscribers to its paywall. Retrieved from the Mumbrella website: <nowiki>https://mumbrella.com.au/a-decade-on-afr-has-6711-subscribers-to-its-paywall-39369</nowiki></ref> In addition, it was later determined that the ''AFR's'' failures in attracting online subscribers was due to its paywall being too expensive. Its 2012 price of $59 AUD was notably higher than other international mastheads, including ''[[The New York Times]]'' which was priced at $37.84 AUD.<ref>Carson, A. (2015). Behind the newspaper paywall – lessons in charging for online content: a comparative analysis of why Australian newspapers are stuck in the purgatorial space between digital and print. ''Media, Culture & Society'', 37(7), 1022–1041. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1177/0163443715591669</nowiki></ref> As a result, the ''AFR'' has since lowered its digital subscription price to $29.50 AUD. 

=== Nine Entertainment merger ===
The mega-cap deal that saw [[Nine Entertainment Co.|Nine Entertainment]] and [[Fairfax Media]] merge was inspired by initial chats between Hugh Marks ([[Nine Entertainment Co.|Nine]] CEO) and Nick Falloon (Fairfax chairman).<ref>McDuling, J. (2018, December 7). What does the Nine-Fairfax merger mean? ''Sydney Morning Herald.'' Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/what-does-the-nine-fairfax-merger-mean-20181204-p50k1o.html</nowiki> </ref> The pair discussed how the two companies’ assets could synergise, improve efficiencies, save costs and increase scale. During the lead up to the merger, there were a few roadblocks. In 2016, the proposed merger was not feasible due to government legislation surrounding media ownership.<ref>Department of Intrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications. (n.d.). ''Updating Australia's media laws.'' Canberra, Australia: Author.</ref> In addition, Nine Entertainment's board believed that its [[share price]] was [[Undervalued stock|undervalued]] and thus wanted to delay any acquisition until its fair value had been reflected. Amongst the delays in talks between the two parties, Fairfax had other suitors including [[private equity]] groups [[TPG Capital]] and [[Hellman & Friedman]], which ended up walking away from the table.<ref>Dunckley, M. (2017, May 7). Fairfax Media confirms unsolicited TPG approach. ''Sydney Morning Herald.'' Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/tpg-moves-to-buy-fairfax-medias-publishing-and-property-arms--reports-20170507-gvzoz2.html</nowiki> </ref>

In 2018, Nine Entertainment's board re-entered into talks with Fairfax of a potential [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] after its share price had jumped following an upbeat earnings report.<ref>Harrison, T. (2018). ''Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd share price is up 15% on profit growth of 55%''. Retrieved from the Motley Fool website: <nowiki>https://www.fool.com.au/2018/02/22/nine-entertainment-co-holdings-ltd-share-price-is-up-15-on-profit-growth-of-55/</nowiki></ref> The proposed structure of the takeover was 0.3627 Nine shares plus $0.025 AUD per Fairfax share, composing a [[cash]] plus [[scrip]] deal. This represented a 21.9% takeover premium to Fairfax's last close, and valued Fairfax at $2313.8mm AUD.<ref>Mergermarket - An Acuris company. (n.d''.). Fairfax Media Limited Nine Entertainment Co. Holdings Ltd Merger.'' Retrieved from www.mergermarket.com/Common/Mergermarket/Deals/DealDetails.aspx?dealsysid=933952&extern=19&id=239512&contextid=1018456074&zone=205&currencyCode=AUD</ref> Once the deal was made, it was reported that Fairfax's portfolio newspapers, including the ''AFR'', would maintain independence from Nine's media groups. As part of the proposed deal, Hugh Marks took over corporate control of the combined group with Fairfax CEO, [[Greg Hywood]], stepping down. 

The combined entity in 2018 was forecasted to have approximately 6,000 employees (inclusive of all the duplicate roles made redundant), major resources across all media types including print, TV, radio and online; and $3 billion in revenue.<ref>McDuling, J. (2018). ''What does the Nine-Fairfax merger mean?'' Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/what-does-the-nine-fairfax-merger-mean-20181204-p50k1o.html</nowiki></ref>

The proposed merger was also put under review by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|ACCC]] on antitrust measures.<ref>Duke, J. (2018, November 8). Competition regulator gives green light to Nine-Fairfax merger. ''Sydney Morning Herald''. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/competition-regulator-gives-green-light-to-nine-fairfax-merger-20181107-p50egf.html</nowiki></ref> It was announced in November 2018 that the ACCC would not oppose the merger. The investigation looked at the merger’s impact on the online news industry’s competition and involved contacting numerous stakeholders. It was noted that the merger would most likely reduce competition in the domestic media market, but that it was not in breach of the [[Competition and Consumer Act 2010|Competition and Consumer Act]]. The main point of divergence between the two business’ assets was the fact that Nine Entertainment’s news assets provided mass market news coverage whereas Fairfax Media’s news assets provided more specialist coverage.<ref>Australia Competition & Consumer Commission. (2018). ''ACCC will not oppose Nine-Fairfax merger''. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-will-not-oppose-nine-fairfax-merger</nowiki></ref>

Despite the ACCC's ruling, there were a few stakeholders who voiced their concerns about the merger's impact on the Australian media industry's competitive landscape.<ref>Duke, J. (2018, November 8). Competition regulator gives green light to Nine-Fairfax merger. ''Sydney Morning Herald''. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/competition-regulator-gives-green-light-to-nine-fairfax-merger-20181107-p50egf.html</nowiki></ref> Union groups such as the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, and the Journalists' union warned the ACCC that the mega-cap takeover would threaten the editorial independence of Fairfax Media's portfolio newspaper companies. Former prime minister Paul Keating also voiced his criticisms labelling the ACCC's decision as "appalling", considering that a more concentrated media industry would reduce coverage of city-specific political issues. <ref>Ex-PM Paul Keating calls Nine, Fairfax merger 'appalling'.

=== Financial Review Rich List ===
The [[Financial Review Rich List]] aims to compile an annual ranking of the wealthiest Australian citizens. The list was first published in the ''[[BRW (magazine)|BRW Magazine]]'' in 1984.<ref>Stensholt, J., Tadros, E. (2017, May 26). Rich List 2017: the 15 names on every list since 1984. ''Australian Financial Review.'' Retrieved from <nowiki>http://www.afr.com.au</nowiki></ref> Since its beginnings, the compilation of the list and its publishing have been taken over by the ''AFR'', now being published annually in the ''Australian Financial Review Magazine'' and on the [https://www.afr.com/rich-list afr.com]. Along with the names of the richest people, the list explicates the person or family's net worth and provides a short summary on the business activities and sector they are engaged in. The valuations are conducted by utilising a mix of publicly available information and private consultations. In 2019, the cut-off for making the Rich List was $472m AUD. In 2020, the cut-off was raised to $540m AUD. <ref>Bailey, M., Sprague, J. (2020, October 30). The full list: Australia's wealthiest 200 revealed. ''Australian Financial Review''. Retrieved from <nowiki>http://www.afr.com.au</nowiki></ref>

== Reporting stance ==
During 1975 to 1983, when ''[[The Australian]]'' widely articulated its political stance on [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[liberalism]], it had been noted that the ''AFR'' also promoted [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] through its news coverage and editorials, exerting influence on the business sphere of Australia and its elitist readership base.<ref>Mcknight, D. (2003). “A World Hungry for a New Philosophy”: Rupert Murdoch and the rise of neo-liberalism. Journalism Studies (London, England), 4(3), 347–358. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1080/14616700306493</nowiki></ref> The newspaper has also been labelled as one of the propagators of radical liberalism during the 1970s – 1980s, shaping the policy debate surrounding market deregulation at that time.<ref>Mcknight, D. (2003). “A World Hungry for a New Philosophy”: Rupert Murdoch and the rise of neo-liberalism. Journalism Studies (London, England), 4(3), 347–358. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1080/14616700306493</nowiki></ref> This was in line with the overarching political stance of all Fairfax Holdings owned newspapers, including ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', which in the 1970s was also right-leaning in its political views.<ref>Tiffen, Rodney. (1987). [https://doi.org/10.2307/20635447 Quality and Bias in the Australian Press: News Limited, Fairfax, and the Herald and Weekly Times]. Australian Quarterly, 59(3-4), p. 329–329.</ref> However, contrasting to ''The Australian'', the ''AFR'' was still perceived as a newspaper with a strong sense of integrity in reporting facts, despite its editorial style leaning towards conservative business ideals.

In the wake of the [[1987 stock market crash]], the Australian news media sector was blamed for overlooking corporate corruption and wrongdoings, whilst publishing primarily favourable news articles handed to them from corporate PR teams.<ref name=C2014/> Also during this time, [[The National Times|''The National'' Times]] who was Australia’s leading financial investigative journalism newspaper, shut down after the stock market crash. So during the 2000s, following the financial market failures and economic downturn of the 1990s, the ''AFR’s'' reporting focus steered more towards business investigative journalism, scrutinising big corporations, government power and corruption.<ref name=C2014/> This was viewed as the ''AFR'' making reparations for its lack of scrutiny over the corporate sector in the lead-up to the stock market crash. 

One major factor that allowed the ''AFR'' to undertake deep corporate investigations was that it did not need advertising revenue to stay afloat – its cover price was sufficient. On the other hand, all other daily mastheads needed company advertising to stay profitable. This afforded the ''AFR’s'' editors the flexibility to pursue and publish news articles that shed a negative light on major companies without needing to be concerned about its financial impacts.

In the early 2010s, the ''AFR''’s political stance has been labelled as neutral.<ref>Boulus, P. (2014). The press and issue framing in the Australian mining tax debate. Australian Journal of Political Science, 49(4), 694–710. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1080/10361146.2014.948378</nowiki></ref> During the controversial 2013 tax debate regarding taxes for ‘extraordinary’ profits generated by mining companies, major mastheads from regions with high mining interests had almost four-fold the amount of negative articles compared to positive articles. ''The Australian'', the biggest national daily, had a large number of both positive and negative articles, but had a limited amount of neutral articles. Out of all the daily mastheads, the ''AFR'' published the most articles surrounding the tax debate and also the most neutral articles.<ref>Boulus, P. (2014). The press and issue framing in the Australian mining tax debate. Australian Journal of Political Science, 49(4), 694–710. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1080/10361146.2014.948378</nowiki></ref>

In 2020, the ''AFR'' is considered “moderately conservative” in its political stance, compared to the only other national daily, Th''e'' ''Australian'', which is known to have a strong neo-liberal bias.<ref>Mcknight, D. (2003). “A World Hungry for a New Philosophy”: Rupert Murdoch and the rise of neo-liberalism. Journalism Studies (London, England), 4(3), 347–358. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1080/14616700306493</nowiki></ref>
