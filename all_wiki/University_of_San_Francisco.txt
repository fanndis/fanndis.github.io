The '''University of San Francisco''' ('''USF''') is a private [[Jesuit]] university in [[San Francisco, California]]. The school's main campus is located on a {{convert|55|acre|ha|adj=on}} setting between the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and [[Golden Gate Park]]. The main campus is nicknamed "The Hilltop", and is split into two sections. Part of the main campus is located on [[Lone Mountain (California)|Lone Mountain]], one of San Francisco's major geographical features.  Its close historical ties with the City and County of San Francisco are reflected in the university's traditional motto, ''Pro Urbe et Universitate'' (''For the City and University'').

==History==
[[File:January Sunset 4.jpg|left|thumb|USF Campus at Sunset]]
Founded by the Jesuits in 1855 as St. Ignatius Academy, USF started as a one-room schoolhouse along [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in what later became downtown San Francisco. Father Anthony Maraschi, S.J. (1820-1897) was the college's founder and  first president, a professor, the college's treasurer, and the first [[pastor]] of St. Ignatius Church. Under Maraschi, St. Ignatius Academy received its charter to issue college degrees on April 30, 1859, from the [[State of California]], and signed by governor [[John B. Weller]]. In that year, the school changed its name to St. Ignatius College.

The original curriculum included [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Latin]], English, [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[algebra]], arithmetic, [[history]], [[geography]], [[elocution]], and [[bookkeeping]].<ref name="autogenerated2005">Ziajka, Alan. ''Legacy & Promise: 150 years of Jesuit education at the University of San Francisco''. San Francisco: University of San Francisco, Association of Jesuit University Presses, 2005.</ref>

A new building was constructed in 1862 to replace the first frame building. In June 1863, the university awarded its first [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. In 1880, the college moved from Market Street to a new site on the corner of Hayes Street and [[Van Ness Avenue (San Francisco)|Van Ness Avenue]] (currently occupied by the [[Davies Symphony Hall]]).

The third St. Ignatius College received moderate damage in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], but was completely destroyed in the ensuing fire. The campus moved west, to the corner of Hayes and Shrader Streets, close to [[Golden Gate Park]]. It occupied a hastily constructed structure known as the Shirt Factory (for its resemblance to similar manufacturing buildings of the era) for the next 21 years. The college moved to its present site on Fulton Street in 1927, on the site of a former [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Cemetery.<ref name="Lighting" />

To celebrate its [[Diamond Jubilee|diamond jubilee]] in 1930, St. Ignatius College changed its name to the University of San Francisco. The change from college to university was sought by many alumni groups and by long-time [[San Francisco Mayor]] [[James Rolph Jr.]]<ref name="autogenerated2005" />

A male-only school for most of its history, USF became fully [[coeducational]] in 1964, though women started attending the evening programs in business and law as early as 1927. In 1969, the [[high school]] division, already wholly separate from the university, moved to the western part of San Francisco and became [[St. Ignatius College Preparatory]]. In 1978, the university acquired [[Lone Mountain College]].<ref name="autogenerated2005" /> October 15, 2005, marked the 150th anniversary of the university's founding.<ref name="USF Sesquincentennial">{{Cite web |url=http://www.usfca.edu/150years/index.html |title=USFCA.edu |access-date=2009-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606021251/http://www.usfca.edu/150years/index.html |archive-date=2009-06-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the fall of 2017, USF enrolled 11,080 undergraduate and graduate students in all of its programs housed in four schools ([[University of San Francisco School of Law|Law]], Management, Education, [[University of San Francisco School of Nursing and Health Professions|Nursing and Health Professions]]) and one college (Arts and Sciences).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usfca.edu/about-usf/what-you-need-to-know/facts-statistics|title=Facts & Statistics|last=Tom|first=Marlene|date=2015-05-04|work=University of San Francisco|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}</ref>

Notable students marked the early years of student diversity at the USF. Chan Chung Wing, whose parents had immigrated from near Canton, was in the first law class at then St. Ignatius College of Law. In 1929, the Filipino Ignatians was founded. In 1930, the African American Isaiah Fletcher was a starting tackle on the football team, years before most colleges became integrated. In 1936, Earl Booker, another African American, won the Intercollegiate Boxing Championship.<ref>Ziajka, Alan. “Student Ethic Diversity Since 1855.” ''Bridging Time: The History of Newsletter of the University of San Francisco'', Volume 1, Issue 1, January 20, 2015.</ref>

[[File:Benedetti Diamond at USF.jpg|left|thumb|alt=|Benedetti Diamond at USF]]
USF competes in [[NCAA Division I]] and is a charter member of the [[West Coast Conference]], along with local rivals [[Santa Clara University]] and [[Saint Mary's College of California]]. Sports offered are men's and women's [[basketball]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[golf]], [[soccer]], [[tennis]], [[track and field]], as well as men's [[baseball]] and women's [[volleyball]] and [[sand volleyball]]. USF's mascot is the [[Don (honorific)|Don]] and its colors are [[green]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]].

===History===
Athletics at USF dates back to its founding in 1855, when founder [[Anthony Maraschi]], S.J., organized ball games as recreation for the first students. Intercollegiate competition dates back to 1907, when then St. Ignatius College began playing organized [[baseball]], [[basketball]], and [[rugby football|rugby]] against other local colleges and high schools. Rivalries with neighboring [[Santa Clara University]] and [[Saint Mary's College of California]] have their origins in this early period.<ref name="autogenerated2005"/>

===1951 USF Dons football team===
The 1951 University of San Francisco Dons football team, coached by [[Joe Kuharich]], went undefeated with a record of 9-0, and produced nine future NFL players. Five became NFL Pro-Bowlers, and [[Gino Marchetti]], [[Ollie Matson]], and [[Bob St. Clair]] later were inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] – a record for one college team. Also the team's [[Burl Toler]] became the first African American official in the NFL.<ref name="waiting2003">Lukacs, John D. "Waiting for the Perfect Ending", ''USA Today'', June 24, 2003. Sports 8C.</ref> Future NFL Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] played a role as the Dons' Athletic Publicist. At the height of their success, due to the team having two African-American star players, Ollie Matson and Burl Toler, they were not invited to play in any of the college football bowl games hosted by the SEC ([[Southern Conference]]).<ref>Clark, Kristine. "Undefeated, United and Uninvited: A Documentary of the 1951 University of San Francisco Dons Football Team". Griffin Publishing, May 2002.</ref> The team, less Toler and Matson, was invited to the [[Orange Bowl]] but declined. Guard Dick Columbini said, "'No, we're not going to leave ‘em at home’ ... ‘We're going to play with ‘em or we’re not going to play.’"<ref name="waiting2003"/> The USF Athletic Department was forced to drop its football program in 1952, due to a deficit in department funds.

===Basketball===
[[File:1954USF NCAA Champ BasketballTeam.jpg|thumb|The 1954-55 USF NCAA Championship basketball team]]
{{Main|San Francisco Dons men's basketball}}
The  [[San Francisco Dons Men's basketball|men's basketball program]] won three national championships: the 1949 NIT Championship, with [[Don Lofgran]] as MVP, and the 1955 and 1956 NCAA National Championships, going undefeated in the 1956 season. Led by NBA Hall of Famers [[Bill Russell]] and [[K.C. Jones]], the 1956 Dons became the first undefeated team to win a national championship, winning a then-record 60 games in a row from 1954 to 1956 before losing an exhibition game to the USA Men's Olympic Basketball team. Also of note, the 1954-1955 USF basketball teams became the first major college or university basketball team to win a national title with three African American starters (Russell, Jones, and [[Hal Perry (basketball)|Hal Perry]]).<ref name="autogenerated2005"/>

===Soccer===
{{main|San Francisco Dons men's soccer}}
The soccer program began at USF in 1931, and they succeeded from the start, winning five titles from 1932 to 1936. The team captain was All-American Gus Donoghue, who returned to the university as head coach in 1946, winning several titles, including a co-championship with Penn State in 1949.

At Donoghue's retirement in 1960, [[Stephen Negoesco]], All-American and Holocaust survivor took over, having played under Donoghue in the 50s. He coached the team from 1962 to 2000, and led them to 540 wins and four national championships (1966, 1975, 1976, and 1980). Negoesco was inducted into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 2003, having set a US record for games won in intercollegiate soccer competition.

Under Negoesco's successor, alumnus Erik Visser, the men's team earned the 2004, 2005, and 2008 WCC titles.<ref name="autogenerated2005"/>
