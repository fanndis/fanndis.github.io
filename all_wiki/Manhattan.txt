==Etymology==

The name ''Manhattan'' derives from the [[Munsee language|Munsee]] Lenape language term ''manaháhtaan'' (where ''manah-'' means "gather", ''-aht-'' means "[[bow (archery)|bow]]", and ''-aan'' is an abstract element used to form verb stems). The Lenape word has been translated as "the place where we get bows" or "place for gathering the (wood to make) bows". According to a Munsee tradition recorded in the 19th century, the island was named so for a grove of [[hickory tree]]s at the lower end that was considered ideal for the making of bows.
It was first recorded in writing as ''Manna-hata'', in the 1609 logbook of Robert Juet, an officer on [[Henry Hudson]]'s yacht ''[[Halve Maen]]'' (''Half Moon'').<ref>{{cite book |url= http://documents.nytimes.com/robert-juet-s-journal-of-hudson-s-1609-voyage#document/p16 |title= Juet's Journal of Hudson's 1609 Voyage, from the 1625 Edition of ''Purchas His Pilgrimes'' |work= The New York Times |year= 2006 |orig-year= 1625 |first= Robert |last= Juet |page= 16 |publisher= The New Netherland Museum |others= Translated by Brea Barthel |access-date= May 11, 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160703074230/http://documents.nytimes.com/robert-juet-s-journal-of-hudson-s-1609-voyage#document/p16 |archive-date= July 3, 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref> A 1610 map depicts the name as Manna-hata, twice, on both the west and east sides of the Mauritius River (later named the [[Hudson River]]).

In 1524, [[Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]]&nbsp;– sailing in service of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] of [[France]]&nbsp;– became the first documented [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] to visit the area that would become New York City. He entered the [[tidal strait]] now known as [[The Narrows]] and named the land around [[Upper New York Harbor]] ''[[New Angoulême]]'', in reference to the family name of King Francis I that was derived from [[Angoulême]] in France; he sailed far enough into the harbor to sight the [[Hudson River]], which he referred to in his report to the French king as a "very big river"; and he named the ''Bay of Santa Margarita'' – what is now Upper New York Bay – after [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the elder sister of the king.<ref>R.

New York City played a complex role in the [[American Civil War]]. The city's strong commercial ties to the [[southern United States]] existed for many reasons, including the industrial power of the Hudson River, which allowed trade with stops such as the [[West Point Foundry]], one of the great manufacturing operations in the early United States; and the city's Atlantic Ocean ports, rendering New York City the American powerhouse in terms of industrial trade between the northern and southern United States. New York's growing immigrant population, which had originated largely from Germany and Ireland, began in the late 1850s to include waves of Italians and Central and Eastern European Jews flowing in en masse.

The 1980s saw a rebirth of [[Wall Street]], and Manhattan reclaimed its role at the center of the worldwide [[financial industry]]. The 1980s also saw Manhattan at the heart of the AIDS crisis, with Greenwich Village at its epicenter. The organizations [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] (GMHC) and [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] (ACT UP) were founded to advocate on behalf of those stricken with the disease.

By the 1990s crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, [[gentrification]], and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008, and the [[crack epidemic (United States)|crack epidemic]] and its associated drug-related violence came under greater control.<ref>Harris, Paul.

====Manhattan Island====
Manhattan Island is loosely divided into Downtown ([[Lower Manhattan]]), Midtown ([[Midtown Manhattan]]), and Uptown ([[Upper Manhattan]]), with [[Fifth Avenue]] dividing Manhattan lengthwise into its [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] and [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]]. Manhattan Island is bounded by the [[Hudson River]] to the west and the [[East River]] to the east. To the north, the [[Harlem River]] divides Manhattan Island from [[the Bronx]] and the mainland United States.

====Marble Hill====
One neighborhood of New York County, Marble Hill, is contiguous with the U.S. mainland. Marble Hill at one time was part of Manhattan Island, but the [[Harlem River Ship Canal]], dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan.<ref name="canal">Gray, Christopher.

Marble Hill is one example of how Manhattan's land has been considerably altered by human intervention. The borough has seen substantial [[land reclamation]] along its waterfronts since Dutch colonial times, and much of the natural variation in its [[topography]] has been evened out.<ref name=Mannahatta/>

====Smaller islands====
{{see also|List of smaller islands in New York City}}

In [[New York Harbor]], there are three smaller islands:
* [[Ellis Island]], shared with [[New Jersey]]
* [[Governors Island]]
* [[Liberty Island]]

Other smaller islands, in the [[East River]], include (from north to south):
* [[Randalls and Wards Islands]], joined by landfill
* [[Mill Rock]]
* [[Roosevelt Island]]
* [[U Thant Island]] (legally Belmont Island)

====Bedrock====
[[File:NY-Central-Park-Rock-7333.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Manhattan schist outcropping in Central Park]]
The [[bedrock]] underlying much of Manhattan is a [[mica]] [[schist]] known as ''Manhattan schist''<ref>The fact that the immediate layer of bedrock in the Bronx is Fordham gneiss, while that of Manhattan is schist has led to the expression: "The Bronx is gneiss (nice) but Manhattan is schist." {{cite concrete|page=42, n1}}</ref> of the [[Manhattan Prong]] physiographic region.

Geologically, a predominant feature of the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near Midtown Manhattan, dips down lower between [[29th Street (Manhattan)|29th Street]] and [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan. It has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and Financial District areas, and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/jhoodwrightpark/highlights/12369 |title=Manhattan Schist in New York City Parks&nbsp;– J.

====Updated seismic analysis====
According to the [[United States Geological Survey]], an updated analysis of [[seismic hazard]] in July 2014 revealed a "slightly lower hazard for tall buildings" in Manhattan than previously assessed. Scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near New York City, which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/new-insight-on-the-nations-earthquake-hazards/|title=New Insight on the Nation's Earthquake Hazards|author1=Jessica Robertson|author2=Mark Petersen|name-list-style=amp|publisher=United States Geological Survey|date=July 17, 2014|access-date=August 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811003539/http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/new-insight-on-the-nations-earthquake-hazards/|archive-date=August 11, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Maps that are oriented to true north (like the one at the right) show the island at a significant tilt. In truth, avenues run closer to northeast and southwest than north and south."</ref> This usage differs from that of most American cities, where ''downtown'' refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] at the southern tip of the island, and [[Midtown Manhattan]]. The term ''uptown'' also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]] and ''downtown'' to the southern portion below [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]],<ref name="NYCBasics">{{cite web|url=http://www.nycvisit.com/content/index.cfm?pagePkey=365 |title=NYC Basics |access-date=October 11, 2007 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011014616/http://www.nycvisit.com/content/index.cfm?pagePkey=365 |archive-date=October 11, 2007 }}, [[NYC & Company]]. Accessed June 30, 2009. "Downtown (below 14th Street) contains Greenwich Village, SoHo, TriBeCa, and the Wall Street financial district."</ref> with ''Midtown'' covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation.

[[Fifth Avenue]] roughly bisects Manhattan Island and acts as the demarcation line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, at a rate of 100 per block on most streets.<ref name="NYCBasics"/> South of [[Waverly Place]], Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Although the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of [[Houston Street]] (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. The rule of thumb is that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.<ref name=Stuff/>

Manhattan has been the scene of many important American cultural movements. In 1912, about 20,000 workers, a quarter of them women, marched upon [[Washington Square Park]] to commemorate the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]], which killed 146 workers on March 25, 1911. Many of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, a clothing style that became the working woman's uniform and a symbol of [[women's liberation]], reflecting the alliance of labor and suffrage movements.<ref>[http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/trianglefire/ The Triangle Factory Fire] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/67c8qVy2v?url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/trianglefire/ |date=May 12, 2012 }}, [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]].

The [[Harlem Renaissance]] in the 1920s established the African-American literary canon in the United States and introduced writers [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Zora Neale Hurston]]. Manhattan's vibrant visual art scene in the 1950s and 1960s was a center of the American [[pop art]] movement, which gave birth to such giants as [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. The downtown pop art movement of the late 1970s included artist [[Andy Warhol]] and clubs like [[Serendipity 3]] and [[Studio 54]], where he socialized.

The office of [[Borough President]] was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the [[New York City Board of Estimate]], which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional because Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough, a violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment's]] [[Equal Protection Clause]] pursuant to the high court's 1964 "one man, one vote" decision.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0489_0688_ZS.html Cornell Law School Supreme Court Collection: Board of Estimate of City of New York v.

The [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] called for twelve numbered avenues running north and south roughly parallel to the shore of the [[Hudson River]], each {{convert|100|ft|m|-1}} wide, with [[First Avenue (Manhattan)|First Avenue]] on the east side and [[Twelfth Avenue (Manhattan)|Twelfth Avenue]] on the west side. There are several intermittent avenues east of First Avenue, including four additional lettered avenues running from [[Avenue A (Manhattan)|Avenue A]] eastward to [[Avenue D (Manhattan)|Avenue D]] in an area now known as [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. The numbered streets in Manhattan run east-west, and are generally {{convert|60|ft|m|0}} wide, with about {{convert|200|ft|m|0}} between each pair of streets. With each combined street and block adding up to about {{convert|260|ft|m}}, there are almost exactly 20&nbsp;blocks per mile. The typical block in Manhattan is {{convert|250|by|600|ft|m}}.

According to the original Commissioner's Plan, there were [[155th Street (Manhattan)|155]] numbered crosstown streets,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/realestate/23scap.html |title=Are Manhattan's Right Angles Wrong, by Christopher Gray |access-date=May 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502035251/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/realestate/23scap.html |archive-date=May 2, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> but later the grid was extended up to the northernmost corner of Manhattan, where the last numbered street is [[220th Street (Manhattan)|220th Street]]. Moreover, the numbering system continues even in [[The Bronx]], north of Manhattan, despite the fact that the grid plan is not as regular in that borough, whose last numbered street is 263rd Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gis.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/ |title=New York City Map |publisher=NYC.gov |access-date=May 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731043934/http://gis.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/ |archive-date=July 31, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Fifteen crosstown streets were designated as {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide, including [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th]], [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd]], [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th]] and [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th]] Streets,<ref>[http://www.library.cornell.edu/Reps/DOCS/nyc1811.htm Remarks of the Commissioners for laying out streets and roads in the City of New York, under the Act of April 3, 1807] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610165318/http://www.library.cornell.edu/Reps/DOCS/nyc1811.htm |date=June 10, 2007 }}, [[Cornell University]].

"These streets are all sixty feet wide except fifteen, which are one hundred feet wide, viz.: Numbers fourteen, twenty-three, thirty-four, forty-two, fifty-seven, seventy-two, seventy-nine, eighty-six, ninety-six, one hundred and six, one hundred and sixteen, one hundred and twenty-five, one hundred and thirty-five, one hundred and forty-five, and one hundred and fifty-five—the block or space between them being in general about two hundred feet."</ref> which became some of the borough's most significant transportation and [[shopping]] venues. [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] is the most notable of many exceptions to the grid, starting at [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] in Lower Manhattan and continuing north into the Bronx at Manhattan's northern tip. In much of Midtown Manhattan, Broadway runs at a diagonal to the grid, creating major named intersections at [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] ([[Park Avenue|Park Avenue South/Fourth Avenue]] and 14th Street), [[Madison Square]] ([[Fifth Avenue]] and 23rd Street), [[Herald Square]] ([[Sixth Avenue]] and 34th Street), [[Times Square]] ([[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] and 42nd Street), and [[Columbus Circle]] ([[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]]/[[Central Park West]] and 59th Street). 

"Crosstown traffic" refers primarily to vehicular traffic between Manhattan's [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] and [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]]. The trip is notoriously frustrating for drivers because of heavy [[traffic congestion|congestion]] on narrow local streets laid out by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, absence of express roads other than the [[Trans-Manhattan Expressway]] at the far north end of Manhattan Island; and restricted to very limited crosstown automobile travel within [[Central Park]]. Proposals in the mid-1900s to build express roads through the city's densest neighborhoods, namely the [[Mid-Manhattan Expressway]] and [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]], did not go forward. Unlike the rest of the United States, New York State prohibits right or left turns on red in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce traffic collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City,  therefore, all turns at red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present, significantly shaping traffic patterns in Manhattan.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.safeny.ny.gov/roadrule.htm | title=Rules of the Road}}</ref>

Being primarily an island, Manhattan is linked to New York City's outer boroughs by numerous bridges, of various sizes. Manhattan has fixed [[highway]] connections with [[New Jersey]] to its west by way of the [[George Washington Bridge]], the [[Holland Tunnel]], and the [[Lincoln Tunnel]], and to three of the four other New York City boroughs—[[the Bronx]] to the northeast, and [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]] (both on [[Long Island]]) to the east and south. Its only direct connection with the fifth New York City borough, [[Staten Island]], is the [[Staten Island Ferry]] across [[New York Harbor]], which is free of charge.
