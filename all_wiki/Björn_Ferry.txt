'''Björn Ferry''' (born 1 August 1978 in [[Stensele]], [[Västerbotten County]]) is a former [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[biathlete]] and medal winning Olympian. He began competing internationally in World Cup competitions in 2001, but did not win his first international race until the 2007–2008 season. In 2007, he won gold in the mixed relay event at the Biathlon World Championships. The next year, at his third [[Winter Olympics]] appearance, he won the gold medal in the [[Biathlon at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's pursuit|pursuit]] event. He started the event in 8th place as determined by the previous sprint event, but managed to overtake the race leader on the final lap.

==Career==
Ferry debuted in the [[Biathlon World Cup|World Cup]] in [[Hochfilzen]] in 2001, and earned his first World Cup points after only skiing three races. He finished his first season ranked 36th in World Cup standings. In World Cup competition, he slowly improved his ranking, and by the 2006–2007 season was ranked in the top ten worldwide. His first Olympic appearance, at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], was disappointing, but four years later at the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Games]] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] he was a member of a Swedish relay team that placed fourth, just off the medal stand.<ref name="IBUprofile"/>

Ferry has seen some of his strongest efforts and best finishes in Italy, even beyond the 2006 success. His first two World Cup victories both came in the pursuit in [[Antholz]]-[[Anterselva]], in the 2007–2008 and 2008–2009 seasons. In 2007, he won a gold medal in the mixed relay in the 2007 World Championships alongside [[Helena Jonsson]], [[Anna Carin Olofsson]], and [[Carl Johan Bergman]]. Although his 2009–2010 season was lackluster, and Ferry saw his ranking drop from 9th to 16th place in the World Cup, Ferry was again selected for the Swedish team for the [[2010 Olympic Games]] in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. In the [[Biathlon at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's pursuit|pursuit event]] held on February 16, Ferry finished in first place, winning the gold medal after catching and passing the race leader on the final lap of the race.<ref name="IBUprofile"/> He beat second-place finisher [[Christoph Sumann]] of [[Austria at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Austria]] by only 16.5 seconds. The victory marked the first Olympic biathlon gold for a Swedish athlete in a half-century.<ref name="afp"/>

Ferry practices with the Storuman IK club. His personal coach was German [[Wolfgang Pichler]]<ref name="IBUprofile"/> until Pichler left his role as coach of the Swedish biathlon team in 2010. He subsequently described the atmosphere in the team under Pichler as being like a [[cult]], although he praised Pichler for the energy he brought to the role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=3277&grupp=16295&artikel=4642319 |title=Ferry: "Det var som en sekt" |last=Sundqvist |first=Lena|last2=Antonsson |first2=John|date=11 August 2010|website=[[Sveriges Radio]]|language=Swedish |trans-title=Ferry: "It was like a cult" }}</ref>

In March 2014, Ferry confirmed that he would be retiring from the sport at the end of the [[2013–14 Biathlon World Cup|2013–14 season]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biathlon-pokljuka.com/BIATHLON_POKLJUKA_EN,,novice,year_2013.htm&showNews=NEWSMZZRJB38201491226&cPage=1 |title=Biathlon world to see some retirements after season's end |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=8 March 2014 |website=biathlon-pokljuka.com |access-date=16 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317142055/http://www.biathlon-pokljuka.com/BIATHLON_POKLJUKA_EN%2C%2Cnovice%2Cyear_2013.htm%26showNews%3DNEWSMZZRJB38201491226%26cPage%3D1 |archive-date=17 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Opposition to doping===
Ferry has been outspoken in his opposition to the use of banned substances by athletes who participate in international competition, a practice known as doping. In 2009, he was quoted referring to Russian athletes who had used such substances as 'idiots' and received a number of death threats.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} During the 2010 winter Olympics, he was quoted saying he would not mind if athletes who use banned substances would get the [[death penalty]] or, "at least lots of kicks in the balls."<ref name="bild">{{Cite web | title = Swedish Biathlon Star Bjorn Ferry on Doping: "Drug cheats should get the death penalty!" | work = Bild.com | date = 2010-02-15 | url = http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/bild-english/sport-news/vancouver-olympics-2010/02/15/bjorn-ferry-doping-views/swedish-biathlon-star-demands-death-penalty-for-drugs-cheats.html | accessdate = 2010-02-17}}</ref><ref>[Original Swedish: "För mig får det gärna bli dödsstraff eller alla fall en upprepad pungspark för alla dopningsbrott", translated: "For me it's ok if it would be death penalty or at least a repeated kick on the balls for all doping crimes"]</ref> Further comments referred to dopers as people with low moral standards and suggested that the problem of use of banned substances in sport would not go away until more severe penalties were imposed.

==Personal life==
Ferry is married to arm wrestler [[Heidi Andersson]], who has won multiple world championships in [[arm wrestling]].<ref name="afp">{{Cite news | last = Agence France-Presse | title = Biathlon (Sprint): Sweden's Ferry wins men's 12.5km pursuit | newspaper = Vancouver 2010 | date = 2010-02-16 | url = http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/afp-news/biathlon-(sprint)--sweden's-ferry-wins-men's-12.5km-pursuit_280444BH.html | accessdate = 2010-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Ferry |first=Björn |title=Björnfakta |url=http://www.bjornferry.com/Default.asp?path=1653&pageid=1456 |language=Swedish |accessdate=2010-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220172216/http://www.bjornferry.com/Default.asp?path=1653&pageid=1456 |archivedate=2010-02-20 }}</ref> In November 2017, he announced he'd given up flying because of the environment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/klimat/bjorn-ferry-nobbar-os-for-klimatet/|title=Björn Ferry nobbar OS i Sydkorea för klimatet|publisher=Expressen|language=Swedish|author=Robert Börjesson|date=21 November 2017|accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref>

In March and April 2018, SVT aired programme series ''[[Storuman Forever]]'', depicting the Heidi Andersson and Björn Ferry couple's climate engagement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://smdb.kb.se/catalog/id/003806921|title=SVT1 2018-03-20|publisher=Swedish Media Database|language=Swedish|date=20 March 2018|accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://smdb.kb.se/catalog/id/003813359|title=SVT1 2018-04-17|publisher=Swedish Media Database|language=Swedish|date=17 April 2018|accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref>

''[[Flight shame|Flygskam]]'', translating as ‘Flight Shame’, or ‘Flight Conscience’, a social pressure not to fly because of the rising greenhouse gas emissions of the airline industry, was originally championed by Björn Ferry but has since gained considerable momentum after Thunberg’s refusal to fly on environmental grounds. Sweden has reported a 4% drop in domestic travel for 2019 and a 9% increase in rail use. The [[BBC]] claims that the movement could halve the growth of global air travel, but Airbus and Boeing claim that it will continue to grow at around  4% until 2035.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190909-why-flight-shame-is-making-people-swap-planes-for-trains|title=Why ‘flight shame’ is making people swap planes for trains|last=Timperley|first=Jocelyn|website=www.bbc.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://10daily.com.au/news/world/a200113zjhcl/sweden-is-shaming-people-into-not-travelling-by-plane-20200113|title=Sweden's Flight Shame Is Having A Turbulent Effect On P... {{!}} 10 daily|website=10daily.com.au|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref>
