==Early life==
Lee was born in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, the son of Jacqueline Carroll ([[née]] Shelton), a teacher of arts and black literature, and [[Bill Lee (musician)|William James Edward Lee III]], a jazz musician and [[composer]].<ref name="filmrefbio" /><ref name="refwho" /> Lee has three younger siblings, [[Joie Lee|Joie]], [[David Lee (still photographer)|David]], and [[Cinqué Lee|Cinqué]], each of whom has worked in many different positions in Lee's films.

He attended [[John Dewey High School]] in Brooklyn's [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend neighborhood]].

Lee enrolled in [[Morehouse College]], a [[historically black college]], where he made his first student film, ''Last Hustle in Brooklyn''. He took film courses at [[Clark Atlanta University]] and graduated with a B.A. in [[mass communication]] from Morehouse. He did graduate work at [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], where he earned a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in film and television.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.morehouse.edu/about/boardbios/slee.html |publisher=Morehouse College |title=SHELTON "SPIKE" LEE '79 |date=April 9, 2012 |access-date=April 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506002442/https://www.morehouse.edu/about/boardbios/slee.html |archive-date=May 6, 2012}}</ref>

==Career==

===1980s===
In 1983, Lee premiered his film independent short film titled, ''[[Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads]]''. Lee submitted the film as his [[master's degree]] [[thesis]] at the [[Tisch School of the Arts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectrumculture.com/2012/03/oeuvre-spike-lee-joes-bed-stuy-barbershop-we-cut-heads.html/ |title=Oeuvre: Spike Lee: Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads |publisher=Spectrum Culture |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2012-12-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317165601/http://spectrumculture.com/2012/03/oeuvre-spike-lee-joes-bed-stuy-barbershop-we-cut-heads.html/ |archive-date=March 17, 2012 }}</ref> Lee's classmates [[Ang Lee]] and [[Ernest Dickerson|Ernest R. Dickerson]] worked on the film as [[assistant director]] and [[cinematographer]], respectively. The film was the first student film to be showcased in [[Lincoln Center]]'s New Directors New Films Festival. Lee's father, [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill Lee]], composed the score. The film won a [[Student Academy Award]].

[[File:Spike Lee.jpg|thumb|Lee circa 1990s]]
In 1985, Lee began work on his first feature film, ''[[She's Gotta Have It]]''. The film filmed in [[black-and-white]], concerns a young woman (Johns) who is seeing three men, and the feelings this arrangement provokes. The film was Lee's first feature-length film that launched Lee's career. Lee wrote, directed, produced, starred and edited the film with a budget of $175,000, he shot the film in two weeks. When the film was released in 1986, it grossed over $7 million at the U.S. box office.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=shesgottahaveit.htm |title=She's Gotta Have It (1986) |website=Box Office Mojo |date=August 26, 1986 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref> ''[[New York Times]]'' film critic [[A.O. Scott]] wrote that the film "ushered in (along with [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Stranger Than Paradise]]'') the American independent film movement of the 1980s. It was also a groundbreaking film for African-American filmmakers and a welcome change in the representation of blacks in American cinema, depicting men and women of color not as pimps and whores, but as intelligent, upscale urbanites."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/44229/She-s-Gotta-Have-It/overview | work=The New York Times | first=A.

In 1989, Lee made perhaps his most seminal film, ''[[Do the Right Thing]],'' which focused on a Brooklyn neighborhood's simmering racial tension on a hot summer day. The film's cast included Lee, [[Danny Aiello]], [[Bill Nunn]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], [[Rosie Perez]], [[John Turturro]], [[Martin Lawrence]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. The film gained critical acclaim as one of the best films of the year from film critics including both [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] who ranked the film as the best of 1989, and later in their top 10 films of the decade ({{Numero|6}} for Siskel and {{Numero|4}} for Ebert).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjYS8EUakgs |title= Siskel & Ebert 1989-Best of 1989 (2of2) |publisher= [[YouTube]] |date= 17 December 2010 |access-date= 29 April 2015}}</ref> Ebert later added the film to his list of ''[[The Great Movies]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/great-movies/ |title= The Great Movies |author= Roger Ebert |publisher= rogerebert.com |access-date= 29 April 2015}}</ref> 

To many people's surprise, the film was not nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] or [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] at the [[Academy Awards]]. The film only earned two Academy Award nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], Spike Lee's first Oscar nomination, and for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Danny Aiello. At the Academy ceremony [[Kim Basinger]], who was a presenter that evening, stated that ''Do the Right Thing'' also deserved a Best Picture nomination stating, "We've got five great films here, and they are great for one reason, because they tell the truth, but there is one film missing from this list because ironically it might tell the biggest truth of all and that's ''Do the Right Thing''".<ref>{{cite news |title=Kim Basinger Rips Academy for Snubbing Spike Lee's Film |work=Jet |issue=27 |publisher=Ebony Media Operations |date=16 Apr 1990}}</ref> The film that did win Best Picture was ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'' a film which focused on race relations between an elderly Jewish woman ([[Jessica Tandy]]) and her driver ([[Morgan Freeman]]).<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywood-flashback-a-snubbed-spike-lee-trashed-wim-wenders-at-cannes-1989-1111408 Hollywood Flashback: A Snubbed Spike Lee Trashed Wim Wenders at Cannes in 1989|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Lee said in an April 7, 2006 interview with ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine that the other film's success, which he thought was based on safe stereotypes, hurt him more than if his film had not been nominated for an award.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hill |first=Logan |url=http://nymag.com/anniversary/40th/culture/45772/ |title=Q&A with Spike Lee on Making 'Do the Right Thing' |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Spike Lee 1.jpg|thumb|160px|Lee at the 1999 [[Cannes Film Festival]]]]
After the 1990 release of ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]'', Lee was accused of [[antisemitism]] by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and several film critics. They criticized the characters of the club owners Josh and Moe Flatbush, described as "[[Shylock]]s". Lee denied the charge, explaining that he wrote those characters in order to depict how black artists struggled against exploitation. Lee said that [[Lew Wasserman]], [[Sidney Sheinberg]], or Tom Pollock, the Jewish heads of MCA and [[Universal Studios]], were unlikely to allow antisemitic content in a film they produced. He said he could not make an antisemitic film because Jews run Hollywood, and "that's a fact".<ref name=Times900816>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/16/movies/critic-s-notebook-spike-lee-s-jews-passage-benign-cliche-into-bigotry.html |title=Spike Lee's Jews and the Passage from Benign Cliche into Bigotry |last=James |first=Caryn |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 16, 1990 |accessdate=December 1, 2009}}</ref>

In 1992, Spike released his biographical epic film ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'' based on the ''[[Autobiography of Malcolm X]]'', starring [[Denzel Washington]] as the famed civil rights leader. The film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X's life: his criminal career, his [[Prison|incarceration]], his [[conversion to Islam]], his ministry as a member of the [[Nation of Islam]] and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to [[Betty Shabazz|Betty X]], his [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] and reevaluation of his views concerning [[White people|whites]], and his [[assassination]] on February 21, 1965.  Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], and his experiences with racism are dramatized in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s. The film received widespread critical acclaim including from critic [[Roger Ebert]] ranked the film No. 1 on his Top 10 list for 1992 and described the film as "one of the great screen biographies, celebrating the sweep of an American life that bottomed out in prison before its hero reinvented himself."<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Best 10 Movies of 1992|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19921231/COMMENTARY/40308026/1023|work=rogerebert.com|accessdate=March 15, 2011|date=December 31, 1992}}</ref> Ebert and [[Martin Scorsese]], who was sitting in for late ''At the Movies'' co-host [[Gene Siskel]], both ranked ''Malcolm X'' among the ten best films of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/bestof90s.shtml|title=The Best Films of the 1990s|accessdate=June 21, 2010|last=Anderson|first=Jeffrey M.|publisher=Combustible Celluloid }}</ref> Denzel Washington's portrayal of Malcolm X in particular was widely praised and he was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].

In 2006, Lee directed ''[[Inside Man]]'' starring [[Denzel Washington]], [[Jodie Foster]], and [[Clive Owen]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Christopher Plummer]].

''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film four stars out of five, concluding, "It's certainly a Spike Lee film, but no Spike Lee Joint. Still, he's delivered a pacy, vigorous and frequently masterful take on a well-worn genre.

In response to the [[2020 United States Presidential election|2020 Presidential election]], Spike celebrated [[Joe Biden]]'s victory over [[Donald Trump]] by celebrating in the streets of [[Brooklyn]] cracking open a bottle of champagne among a crowd of onlookers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://popculture.com/trending/news/watch-spike-lee-pops-bottle-champagne-brooklyn-donald-trump-loss-joe-biden/|title= Watch: Spike Lee Pops a Bottle of Champagne in Middle of Brooklyn Street to Celebrate Joe Biden's Win|website= PopCulture|accessdate= November 8, 2020}}</ref> Photos and videos of Spike went viral on [[twitter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/viral/spike-lee-trump-loss-champagne-twitter/|title= Spike Lee Toasting Trump's Loss With A Bottle Of Champagne Is Making People Even Happier|website= Uproxx|accessdate= November 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/spike-lee-video-champagne-joe-biden-president-trump-lost-b1676312.html|title= Spike Lee filmed cracking open bottle of champagne in New York street after Joe Biden wins election|website= The Independent|accessdate= November 8, 2020}}</ref>

==Controversies==
In May 1999, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Lee made an inflammatory comment about [[Charlton Heston]], president of the [[National Rifle Association]], while speaking to reporters at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Lee was quoted as saying the National Rifle Association should be disbanded and, of Heston, someone should "Shoot him with a [[British Bull Dog revolver|.44 Bull Dog]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-05-28/news/9905290188_1_nra-president-rash-of-school-shootings-remarks |title=Spike Lee Says Remark About Shooting Heston Was A Joke – Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=May 28, 1999 |accessdate=February 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/08/entertainment/et-hestonletters8 |title=Heston was always a man of his words – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=February 13, 2013}}</ref> Lee said he intended it as a joke. He was responding to coverage about whether Hollywood was responsible for school shootings. "The problem is guns", he said.<ref name="Salon" /> [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] condemned Lee as having "nothing to offer the debate on school violence except more violence and more hate".<ref name="Salon">{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/log/1999/05/28/spike/index.html |title=Living foot to mouth |work=Salon.com |date=May 28, 1999 |accessdate=June 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623115810/https://www.salon.com/ent/log/1999/05/28/spike/index.html |archive-date=June 23, 2008}}</ref>

In October 2005, Lee responded to a [[CNN]] anchor's question as to whether the government intentionally ignored the plight of black Americans during the [[Hurricane Katrina#Federal government|2005 Hurricane Katrina catastrophe]] by saying, "It's not too far-fetched. I don't put anything past the United States government. I don't find it too far-fetched that they tried to displace all the black people out of [[New Orleans]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QroaAAAAIBAJ&dq=far-fetched+that+they+tried+to+displace+all+the+black+people&pg=6597,2786253 |title=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel – Google News Archive Search |website=news.google.com}}</ref> In later comments, Lee cited the government's past including the [[Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sootoday.com/content/arts/details.asp?c=14840 |title=All about Spike Lee's latest film }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7j0SqSn14A |title=Clip of Lee expressing his views of the Hurricane Katrina and Tuskegee matters on ''Real Time with Bill Maher'' |publisher=Youtube.com |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>

At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, Lee, who was then making ''[[Miracle at St. Anna]],'' about an all-black U.S. division fighting in Italy during [[World War II]], criticized director [[Clint Eastwood]] for not depicting black Marines in his own World War II film, ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]''. Citing historical accuracy, Eastwood responded that his film was specifically about the Marines who raised the flag on [[Mount Suribachi]] at [[Iwo Jima]], pointing out that while black Marines did fight at Iwo Jima, the U.S. military was [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] during World War II, and none of the men who raised the flag were black. He angrily said that Lee should "shut his face". Lee responded that Eastwood was acting like an "angry old man", and argued that despite making two Iwo Jima films back to back, ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'' and ''Flags of Our Fathers'', "there was not one black soldier in both of those films".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5015524 |last=Marikar |first=Sheila |title=Spike Strikes Back: Clint's 'an Angry Old Man' |publisher=ABC News |date=June 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7439371.stm |work=BBC News |title=Eastwood hits back at Lee claims |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=August 4, 2009}}</ref><ref name="thr">{{cite journal |last=Lyman |first=Eric J. |title=Lee calls out Eastwood, Coens over casting |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |issue=8 |pages=3, 24 |date=May 21, 2008 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3if545c66bc7e57054b34aaa6cd2b36458 }}</ref> He added that he and Eastwood were "not on a plantation".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jun/09/news.usa |title='We're not on a plantation, Clint' |date=June 9, 2008 |first=Martin |last=Wainwright |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Lee later claimed that the event was exaggerated by the media and that he and Eastwood had reconciled through mutual friend [[Steven Spielberg]], culminating in his sending Eastwood a print of ''Miracle at St. Anna''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://omg.yahoo.com/news/access-exclusive-spike-lee-on-clint-eastwood-we-re-cool/12796 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105205333/http://omg.yahoo.com/news/access-exclusive-spike-lee-on-clint-eastwood-we-re-cool/12796|url-status=dead |title="Access Exclusive: Spike Lee On Clint Eastwood: 'We're Cool'" OMG!/Yahoo!

Lee has been criticized for his representation of women. For example, [[Bell Hooks]] said that he wrote black women in the same objectifying way that white male filmmakers write the characters of white women.<ref>{{Cite book|last=hooks|first=bell|date=2014-10-10|title=Black Looks|doi=10.4324/9781315743226|isbn=9781315743226}}</ref> [[Rosie Perez]], who was in an acting role for the first time as Tina in ''Do the Right Thing'', said later that she was very uncomfortable with doing the nude scene in the film:

{{Quote
|text="My first experience [with doing nude scenes] was ''Do the Right Thing''. And I had a big problem with it, mainly because I was afraid of what my family would think — that's what was really bothering me. It wasn't really about taking off my clothes. But I also didn't feel good about it because the atmosphere wasn't correct. And when Spike Lee puts ice cubes on my nipples, the reason you don't see my head is because I'm crying. I was like, I don't want to do this."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/25/magazine/the-pressure-to-take-it-off.html|title=The Pressure To Take It Off|last=Udovitch|first=Mim|date=2000-06-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In March 2012, after the [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]], Spike Lee was one of many people who used Twitter to circulate a message that claimed to give the home address of the shooter [[George Zimmerman]]. The address turned out to be incorrect, causing the real occupants, Elaine and David McClain, to leave home and stay at a hotel due to numerous death threats.<ref name=tsgtwit/> Lee issued an apology and reached an agreement with the McClains, which reportedly included "compensation", with their attorney stating "The McClains' claim is fully resolved".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/28/justice/florida-teen-spike-lee/?hpt=us_c2 |title=Spike Lee apologizes for retweeting wrong Zimmerman address |publisher=CNN |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-trayvon-martin-lee-settlement-20120329,0,7063902.story |title=Trayvon Martin: Spike Lee settles with family forced to flee home |first=Michael |last=Muskal |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> Nevertheless, in November 2013, the McClains filed a negligence lawsuit which accused Lee of "encouraging a dangerous mob mentality among his Twitter followers, as well as the public-at-large".<ref name=tsgtwit>{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/spike-lee-tweet-lawsuit-675413 |title=Elderly Couple Sues Spike Lee Over Tweet |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |date=November 8, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/spike-lee-sued-over-george-zimmerman-tweet-165719017--abc-news-topstories.html |title=Spike Lee Sued Over George Zimmerman Tweet |publisher=ABC News |author=Colleen Curry |date=November 11, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}</ref> The lawsuit, which a court filing reportedly valued at $1.2 million, alleged that the couple suffered "injuries and damages" that continued after the initial settlement up through [[State of Florida v.

In March 2020, a video of Spike was released on Twitter showing the director having an altercation with the security team near the elevators at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Speculation arose as to whether Spike was being removed from the building. The [[New York Knicks]] released a statement saying, "The idea that Spike Lee is a victim because we have repeatedly asked him to not use our employee entrance and instead use a dedicated VIP entrance — which is used by every other celebrity who enters The Garden — is laughable. He is welcome to come to The Garden anytime via the VIP or general entrance; just not through our employee entrance, which is what he and Jim ([[James L. Dolan|James Dolan]]) agreed to [Monday] night when they shook hands." Spike refuted Dolan's story alleging that he had been using the same entrance for the past 28 years. Lee stated he wouldn't attend the rest of the games for the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/knicks-call-spike-lee-employee-entrance-dispute-laughable-n1148401|title= Knicks call Spike Lee employee entrance dispute 'laughable'|website= [[NBC]]|accessdate= August 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/spike-lee-new-york-knicks-feud-employee-entrance-james-dolan-1490336|title= Here's Why Spike Lee and the New York Knicks Are Feuding Right Now|website= [[Newsweek]]|accessdate= August 4, 2020}}</ref> 

In June 2020, Lee defended filmmaker [[Woody Allen]] despite his [[Woody Allen sexual abuse allegation|sexual abuse allegation]] during a radio interview stating: "I'd just like to say Woody Allen is a great, great filmmaker and [[cancel culture|this cancel thing]] is not just Woody. And I think when we look back on it we are going to see that short of killing somebody, I don't know you that you can just erase somebody like they never existed. Woody's a friend of mine.
