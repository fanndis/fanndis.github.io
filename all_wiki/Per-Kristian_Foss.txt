From 1973 to 1977 he was the leader of the [[Norwegian Young Conservatives|Young Conservatives]] (''Unge Høyre''), the youth wing of the Conservative Party.

Dahl: [http://www.dn.no/forsiden/article158559.ece Foss vil ikke lede Høyre] DN, February 2, 2004. Retrieved December 6, 2012</ref> After Høyre struggled in elections and polls during the first years of Erna Solberg's leadership he was also mentioned as a possible new leader,<ref>[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/Solberg---Foss-kan-vare-et-naturlig-navn-5575318.html Solberg: - Foss kan være et naturlig navn] Aftenposten, 2009/2011.
