'''Childhood obesity'''  is a condition where excess [[adipose tissue|body fat]] negatively affects a child's health or well-being.  As methods to determine body fat directly are difficult, the diagnosis of [[obesity]] is often based on [[Body mass index|BMI]]. Due to the rising prevalence of obesity in children and its many adverse health effects it is being recognized as a serious [[public health]] concern.<ref name=Kopelman2005/>  The term overweight rather than obese is often used when discussing childhood obesity, especially in open discussion, as it is less [[Social stigma of obesity|stigmatizing]].<ref name="Bessesen DH 2008 2027–34">{{cite journal |author=Bessesen DH |title=Update on obesity |journal=J.

[[Body mass index]] (BMI) is acceptable for determining obesity for children two years of age and older.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Deurenberg P, Weststrate JA, Seidell JC |title=Body mass index as a measure of body fatness: age- and sex-specific prediction formulas |journal=Br.

The normal range for BMI in children vary with age and sex.  While a BMI above the 85th percentile is defined as overweight, a BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile is defined as obesity by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. It has published tables for determining this in children.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_BMI/about_childrens_BMI.htm |title=Healthy Weight: Assessing Your Weight: BMI: About BMI for Children and Teens |work=CDC }}</ref>

The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|US Preventive Service Task Force]] reported that not all children with a high BMI need to lose weight though. High BMI can identify a possible weight problem, but does not differentiate between fat or lean tissue.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050706005941/en/Experts-Discuss-Childhood-Obesity-Role-BMI | title=Experts Available to Discuss Childhood Obesity, Role of BMI | publisher=Business Wire ExpertSource Group | year=2005 | accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref> Additionally, BMI may mistakenly rule out some children who do have excess adipose tissue. It is therefore beneficial to supplement the reliability of a BMI diagnosis with additional screening tools such as adipose tissue or skin fold measurements.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/ijpo.242 | pmid=24961794 | volume=10 | issue=3 | title=Diagnostic performance of body mass index to identify obesity as defined by body adiposity in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal=Pediatric Obesity | pages=234–244| year=2015 | last1=Javed | first1=A. | last2=Jumean | first2=M. | last3=Murad | first3=M.

=== Long-term effects ===
Children who are obese are likely to be obese as adults. Thus, they are more at risk for adult health problems such as heart disease, type 2 [[diabetes]], stroke, several types of cancer, and [[osteoarthritis]]. One study showed that children who became obese as early as age 2 were more likely to be obese as adults.<ref>https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/obesity/facts.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317140148/https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/obesity/facts.htm |date=2018-03-17 }}, Adolescent and school health, CDC</ref> According to an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' all of these health effects are contributing to a shorter lifespan of five years for these obese children. It is the first time in two centuries that the current generation of children in America may have a shorter lifespan than their parents.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/17/health/17obese.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Pam | last=Belluck | title=Children's Life Expectancy Being Cut Short by Obesity | date=17 March 2005}}</ref>

== Causes ==
Childhood obesity can be brought on by a range of factors which often act in combination.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ebbeling CB, Pawlak DB, Ludwig DS |title=Childhood obesity: public-health crisis, common sense cure |journal=Lancet |volume=360 |issue=9331 |pages=473–82 |year=2002 |pmid=12241736 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09678-2|s2cid=6374501 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dietz WH |title=Health consequences of obesity in youth: childhood predictors of adult disease |journal=Pediatrics |volume=101 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=518–25 |year=1998 |pmid=12224658 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Speiser PW, Rudolf MC, Anhalt H |title=Childhood obesity |journal=J.

A 2010 review stated that childhood obesity likely is the result of the interaction of natural selection favouring those with [[Thrifty gene hypothesis|more parsimonious energy metabolism]] and today's consumerist society with easy access to energy dense cheap foods and less energy requirements in daily life.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Han JC, Lawlor DA, Kimm SY |title=Childhood obesity |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9727 |pages=1737–1748 |year=2010|pmc=3073855 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60171-7 |pmid=20451244}}</ref>

Factors include the increase in use of technology, increase in snacks and portion size of meals, and the decrease in the physical activity of children. A study found  kids that use electronic devices 3 or more hours a day had between a 17- 44%  increased risk of being overweight, or a 10- 61% increased risk of obese (Cespedes 2011).{{full citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Childhood obesity is common among children from, low-income, African American and Hispanic communities. This is mainly because minority children spend less time playing outside the house and staying active. Some contributors to childhood obesity is that parents would rather have their children stay inside the home because they fear that gang, drug violence, and other dangers might harm them.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=24032305|year=2013|last1=Seipel|first1=M.

=== Genetics ===
Childhood obesity is often the result of an interplay between many genetic and [[environmental factor]]s. [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]] in various [[gene]]s controlling [[appetite]] and [[metabolism]] predispose individuals to obesity when sufficient calories are present. Over 200 genes affect weight by determining activity level, food preferences, body type, and metabolism.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Developmental origins of health and disease|last1 = Gluckman|first1 = Peter|date = 2006|publisher= Cambridge University Press|last2 = Hanson|first2 = Mark A.|isbn=9780511544699 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511544699}}</ref> Having two copies of the allele called FTO increases the likelihood of both obesity and diabetes.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A common variant in the FTO gene is associated with body mass index and predisposes to childhood and adult obesity|last = Frayling|first = Timothy M.|date = May 11, 2007|journal = Science|doi = 10.1126/science.1141634 |pmid =17434869|volume=316|issue = 5826|pages=889–894|pmc=2646098|bibcode = 2007Sci...316..889F}}</ref>

As such, obesity is a major feature of a number of rare genetic conditions that often present in childhood:

* [[Prader–Willi syndrome]] with an incidence between 1 in 12,000 and 1 in 15,000 live births is characterized by hyperphagia and food preoccupations which leads to rapid weight gain in those affected.
* [[Bardet–Biedl syndrome]]
* [[MOMO syndrome]]
* [[Leptin receptor]] mutations
* [[Congenital leptin deficiency]]
* [[Melanocortin receptor]] mutations

In children with early-onset severe obesity (defined by an onset before ten years of age and body mass index over three [[standard deviation]]s above normal), 7% harbor a single locus mutation.<ref name=FarooqiORahilly2006>{{cite journal|last1=Farooqi|first1=I.

=== Family practices ===
In the recent decades, family practices have significantly changed, and several of these practices greatly contribute to childhood obesity:<ref name=":0" />
* With a decreasing number of mothers who breast-feed, more infants become obese children as they grow up and are reared on infant formula instead.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Excessive Leucine-mTORC1-Signalling of Cow Milk-Based Infant Formula: The Missing Link to Understand Early Childhood Obesity|journal = Journal of Obesity|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 2090-0716|pmc = 3317169|pmid = 22523661|pages = 197653|volume = 2012|doi = 10.1155/2012/197653|first = Bodo C.|last = Melnik}}</ref> 
* Less children go outside and engage in active play as technology, such as television and video games, keep children indoors.
* Rather than walking or biking to a bus-stop or directly to school, more school-age children are driven to school by their parents, reducing physical activity.
* As family sizes decrease, the children's pester power, their ability to force adults to do what they want, increases. This ability enables them to have easier access to calorie-packed foods, such as candy and soda drinks.
* The social context around family meal-time plays a role in rates of childhood obesity

=== Social policies ===
[[File:First Lady Michelle Obama has lunch with students.jpg|thumb|Former First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] with students in [[Virginia]] sampling healthy meals being introduced by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]]]
Different communities and nations have adopted varying social practices and policies that are either beneficial or detrimental to children's physical health. These social factors include:<ref name=":0" />
* the quality of [[school lunch]]es
* the emphasis of schools on physical activity
* access to vending machines and fast-food restaurants
* prevalence of and access to parks, bike paths, and sidewalks
* government subsidies for corn oil and sugar
* [[fast food advertising|advertising of fast-food restaurants]] and candy
* prices of healthy and unhealthy foods
* access to fresh, healthy, and affordable food<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Howlett|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Davis|first2=Cassandra|last3=Burton|first3=Scot|title=From Food Desert to Food Oasis: The Potential Influence of Food Retailers on Childhood Obesity Rates|journal=Springer|date=2015|volume=139|issue=2|pages=215–224|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2605-5|s2cid=154755082}}</ref>

==== Advertising ====
Advertising of unhealthy foods correlates with childhood obesity rates.<ref name=":0" /> In some nations, advertising of candy, cereal, and fast-food restaurants is illegal or limited on children's television channels.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Evidence of a possible link between obesogenic food advertising and child overweight|last1 = Lobstein|first1 = Tim|date = 2005|journal = Obesity Reviews|volume = 6|issue = 3|pages = 203–208|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789x.2005.00191.x|pmid = 16045635|last2 = Dibb|first2 = Sue|s2cid = 31485597}}</ref> The media defends itself by blaming the parents for yielding to their children's demands for unhealthy foods.<ref name=":0" />

=== Socioeconomic status ===
It is much more common for young people who come from a racial or ethnic minority, or for those who have a lower [[socioeconomic status]], to be overweight and to engage in less healthy behaviors and sedentary activities.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Delva Jorge |author2=O'Malley Patrick M. |author3=Johnston Lloyd D. | year = 2006 | title = Racial/Ethnic and Socioeconomic Status Differences in Overweight and Health-Related Behaviors among American Students: National Trends 1986-2003 | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 39 | issue = 4| pages = 536–45 | doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2006.02.013|pmid=16982389 }}</ref>

=== Maternal Body Mass Index ===
Maternal body mass index (BMI) is an important predictor of childhood obesity. Mothers with pre-pregnancy obesity, as defined by BMI ≥30kg/m², are known to have children that have higher growth rates and more likely to have obesity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eny |first1=Karen M. |last2=Chen |first2=Shiyi |last3=Anderson |first3=Laura N. |last4=Chen |first4=Yang |last5=Lebovic |first5=Gerald |last6=Pullenayegum |first6=Eleanor |last7=Parkin |first7=Patricia C. |last8=Maguire |first8=Jonathon L. |last9=Birken |first9=Catherine S. |last10=Collaboration |first10=TARGet Kids! |title=Breastfeeding duration, maternal body mass index, and birth weight are associated with differences in body mass index growth trajectories in early childhood |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |date=1 April 2018 |volume=107 |issue=4 |pages=584–592 |doi=10.1093/ajcn/nqx081 |url=https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/107/4/584/4964648 |access-date=30 November 2020 |language=en |issn=0002-9165}}</ref>

=== Dietary ===
The effects of eating habits on childhood obesity are difficult to determine.  A three-year randomized controlled study of 1,704 3rd grade children which provided two healthy meals a day in combination with an exercise program and dietary counsellings failed to show a significant reduction in percentage body fat when compared to a [[Experimental control|control group]].  This was partly due to the fact that even though the children believed they were eating less their actual calorie consumption did not decrease with the intervention.  At the same time observed energy expenditure remained similar between the groups.  This occurred even though dietary fat intake decreased from 34% to 27%.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Caballero B, Clay T, Davis SM |title=Pathways: a school-based, randomized controlled trial for the prevention of obesity in American Indian schoolchildren |journal=Am.

A Cochrane review of a lower fat diet in children (30% or less of total energy) to prevent obesity found the existing evidence of very low to moderate quality, and firm conclusions could not be made.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Naude|first1=Celeste E.|last2=Visser|first2=Marianne E.|last3=Nguyen|first3=Kim A.|last4=Durao|first4=Solange|last5=Schoonees|first5=Anel|date=5 July 2018|title=Effects of total fat intake on bodyweight in children|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=7|pages=CD012960|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD012960.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=6513603|pmid=29974953}}</ref>

Calorie-rich drinks and foods are readily available to children.  Consumption of sugar-laden [[soft drink]]s may contribute to childhood obesity. In a study of 548 children over a 19-month period the likelihood of obesity increased 1.6 times for every additional soft drink consumed per day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Emmett|first1=Pauline M.|last2=Jones|first2=Louise R.|date=2015-10-01|title=Diet, growth, and obesity development throughout childhood in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children|journal=Nutrition Reviews|volume=73 Suppl 3|pages=175–206|doi=10.1093/nutrit/nuv054|issn=1753-4887| pmc=4586450 |pmid=26395342}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=James J, Kerr D |title=Prevention of childhood obesity by reducing soft drinks |journal=Int J Obes (Lond) |volume=29 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=S54–7 |year=2005 |pmid=16385753 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803062|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Calorie-dense, prepared snacks are available in many locations frequented by children.  As childhood obesity has become more prevalent, snack vending machines in school settings have been reduced by law in a small number of localities.  Some research suggests that the increase in availability of junk foods in schools can account for about one-fifth of the increase in average BMI among adolescents over the last decade.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2004/wp2004_16.pdf |title=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''Reading, Writing, and Raisinets: Are School Finances Contributing to Children's Obesity?'', October 2004 |access-date=2013-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021152314/https://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2004/wp2004_16.pdf |archive-date=2012-10-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Eating at [[fast food]] restaurants is very common among young people with 75% of 7th to 12th grade students consuming fast food in a given week.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=French SA, Story M, Neumark-Sztainer D, Fulkerson JA, Hannan P |title=Fast food restaurant use among adolescents: associations with nutrient intake, food choices and behavioral and psychosocial variables |journal=Int.

McDonald's alone has thirteen websites that are viewed by 365,000 children and 294,000 teenagers each month. In addition, fast food restaurants give out toys in children's meals, which helps to entice children to buy the fast food. Forty percent of children ask their parents to take them to fast food restaurants on a daily basis. To make matters worse, out of 3000 combinations created from popular items on children's menus at fast food restaurants, only 13 meet the recommended nutritional guidelines for young children.<ref>Tracy, Ben.

[[Milk|Whole milk]] consumption verses 2% milk consumption in children of one to two years of age had no effect on weight, height, or [[body fat percentage]].  Therefore, whole milk continues to be recommended for this [[Demographic profile|age group]].  However the trend of substituting sweetened drinks for milk has been found to lead to excess weight gain.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Allen RE, Myers AL |title=Nutrition in toddlers |journal=American Family Physician |volume=74 |issue=9 |pages=1527–32 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17111891 }}</ref>

=== Legal ===

Some jurisdictions use laws and regulations in an effort to steer children and parents towards making healthier food choices.  Two examples are [[calorie count laws]] and banning [[soft drink]]s from sale at vending machines in schools.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Reinehr T, Wabitsch M | title = Childhood Obesity | journal = Current Opinion in Lipidology | volume =22 | issue = 1 | year = 2011 | pages = 21–25 | doi = 10.1097/MOL.0b013e32833f9c37 | pmid = 20871401| s2cid = 11863960 }}</ref>  In the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Obesity Health Alliance]] has called on whichever party wins the general election to take measures to reduce childhood obesity, for example by banning advertisements for unhealthy foods before 9:00 pm and banning sports sponsorship by manufacturers of unhealthy foods.

=== Physical activity ===
[[File:Physical education class.jpg|thumb|Secondary students in [[Havana, Cuba]] during a physical education class]]Physical inactivity of children has also shown to be a serious cause, and children who fail to engage in regular physical activity are at greater risk of obesity. Researchers studied the [[physical activity]] of 133 children over a three-week period using an [[accelerometer]] to measure each child's level of physical activity. They discovered the obese children were 35% less active on school days and 65% less active on weekends compared to non-obese children.

Physical inactivity as a child could result in physical inactivity as an adult. In a fitness survey of 6,000 adults, researchers discovered that 25% of those who were considered active at ages 14 to 19 were also active adults, compared to 2% of those who were inactive at ages 14 to 19, who were now said to be active adults.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ortega FB, Ruiz JR, Castillo MJ, Sjöström M |title=Physical fitness in childhood and adolescence: a powerful marker of health |journal=Int J Obes (Lond) |volume= 32|issue= 1 |pages=1–11 |year=2007 |pmid=18043605 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803774|doi-access=free }}</ref> Staying physically inactive leaves unused energy in the body, most of which is stored as [[fat]].

Many children fail to exercise because they spend long periods of time engaging in sedentary activities such as computer usage, playing video games or watching television. Technology has a large factor on the children's activeness. Researchers provided a technology questionnaire to 4,561 children, ages 14, 16, and 18. They discovered children were 21.5% more likely to be overweight when watching 4+ hours of TV per day, 4.5% more likely to be overweight when using a [[computer]] one or more hours per day, and unaffected by potential weight gain from playing [[video games]].<ref name="pmid7598063"/> A [[randomized trial]] showed that reducing TV viewing and computer use can decrease age-adjusted BMI; [[Diet food|reduced calorie]] intake was thought to be the greatest contributor to the BMI decrease.<ref name="pmid18316661">{{cite journal |vauthors=Epstein LH, Roemmich JN, Robinson JL |title=A randomized trial of the effects of reducing television viewing and computer use on body mass index in young children |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=162 |issue=3 |pages=239–45 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18316661 |pmc=2291289 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2007.45 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Technological activities are not the only household influences of childhood obesity. [[Poverty|Low-income]] households can affect a child's tendency to gain weight. Over a three-week period researchers studied the relationship of [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) to [[body composition]] in 194 children, ages 11–12. They measured weight, waist girth, stretch stature, skinfolds, physical activity, TV viewing, and SES; researchers discovered clear SES inclines to [[upper class]] children compared to the [[Working class|lower class]] children.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lluch A, Herbeth B, Méjean L, Siest G |title=Dietary intakes, eating style and overweight in the Stanislas Family Study |journal=Int.

Childhood inactivity is linked to [[obesity]] in the [[United States]] with more children being [[overweight]] at younger ages. In a 2009 preschool study 89% of a preschoolers' day was found to be sedentary while the same study also found that even when outside, 56 percent of activities were still sedentary. One factor believed to contribute to the lack of activity found was little teacher motivation,<ref name="Inactivity"/> but when [[toy]]s, such as [[ball]]s were made available, the children were more likely to play.<ref name="Inactivity">{{cite web  | title = The Inactivity Of Preschoolers Amid Rising Childhood Obesity  | publisher = Medical News Today  | date = February 2009  | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/138289.php  | format = Summarized from Child Development, Vol. 80, Issue 1, Social and Environmental Factors Associated with Preschoolers' Non-sedentary Physical Activity by Brown, WH (University of South Carolina), Pfeiffer, KA (Michigan State University), McIver, KL (East Carolina University), Dowda, M, Addy, CL, and Pate, RR (University of South Carolina).  | accessdate = September 25, 2010  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090211154526/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/138289.php  | archive-date = February 11, 2009  | url-status = dead  }}</ref>

=== Home environment ===
Children's food choices are also influenced by family meals. Researchers provided a [[household]] eating questionnaire to 18,177 children, ranging in ages 11–21, and discovered that four out of five parents let their children make their own food decisions. They also discovered that compared to adolescents who ate three or fewer meals per week, those who ate four to five family meals per week were 19% less likely to report poor consumption of [[vegetables]], 22% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 19% less likely to report poor consumption of [[dairy product|dairy foods]]. Adolescents who ate six to seven family meals per week, compared to those who ate three or fewer family meals per week, were 38% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 31% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 27% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Videon TM, Manning CK |title=Influences on adolescent eating patterns: the importance of family meals |journal=J Adolesc Health |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=365–73 |year=2003 |pmid=12729986 |doi=10.1016/S1054-139X(02)00711-5}}</ref> The results of a survey in the UK published in 2010 imply that children raised by their grandparents are more likely to be obese as adults than those raised by their parents.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8513112.stm | work=BBC News | title=Grandparents 'boost obesity risk' | date=2010-02-15 | accessdate=2010-04-28 | first=Emma | last=Wilkinson}}</ref> An American study released in 2011 found the more mothers work the more children are more likely to be overweight or obese.<ref>{{cite news|title=Childhood obesity risk tied to amount of work mother does lineup announced |url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/kids-of-working-mums-fatter-study-20110208-1al0g.html |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref>

=== Developmental factors ===
Various [[Child development|developmental]] factors may affect rates of obesity.

A child's weight may be influenced when he/she is only an [[infant]]. Researchers also did a cohort study on 19,397 [[babies]], from their birth until age seven and discovered that high weight babies at four months were 1.38 times more likely to be overweight at seven years old compared to normal weight babies. High weight babies at the age of one were 1.17 times more likely to be overweight at age seven compared to normal weight babies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Stettler N, Zemel BS, Kumanyika S, Stallings VA |title=Infant weight gain and childhood overweight status in a multicenter, cohort study |journal=Pediatrics |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=194–9 |year=2002 |pmid=11826195 |doi=10.1542/peds.109.2.194}}</ref>

=== Medical illness ===

[[Cushing's syndrome]] (a condition in which the body contains excess amounts of [[cortisol]]) may also influence childhood obesity. Researchers analyzed two [[isoforms]] ([[proteins]] that have the same purpose as other proteins, but are programmed by different [[genes]]) in the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of 16 adults undergoing [[abdominal surgery]]. They discovered that one type of isoform created oxo-[[reductase]] activity (the alteration of [[cortisone]] to cortisol) and this activity increased 127.5 pmol mg sup when the other type of isoform was treated with cortisol and [[insulin]]. The activity of the cortisol and insulin can possibly activate Cushing's syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bujalska IJ, Kumar S, Stewart PM |title=Does central obesity reflect "Cushing's disease of the omentum"? |journal=Lancet |volume=349 |issue=9060 |pages=1210–3 |year=1997 |pmid=9130942 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)11222-8|s2cid=24643796 }}</ref>

[[Hypothyroidism]] is a [[hormonal]] cause of obesity, but it does not significantly affect obese people who have it more than obese people who do not have it. In a comparison of 108 obese patients with hypothyroidism to 131 obese patients without hypothyroidism, researchers discovered that those with hypothyroidism had only 0.077 points more on the caloric intake scale than did those without hypothyroidism.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tagliaferri M, Berselli ME, Calò G |title=Subclinical hypothyroidism in obese patients: relation to resting energy expenditure, serum leptin, body composition, and lipid profile |journal=Obes.

=== Psychological factors ===
{{main|Psychological aspects of childhood obesity}}
Researchers surveyed 1,520 children, ages 9–10, with a four-year follow up and discovered a [[Correlation|positive correlation]] between obesity and low [[self-esteem]] in the four-year follow up. They also discovered that decreased self-esteem led to 19% of obese children feeling sad, 48% of them feeling bored, and 21% of them feeling nervous. In comparison, 8% of normal weight children felt sad, 42% of them felt bored, and 12% of them felt nervous.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Strauss RS |title=Childhood obesity and self-esteem |journal=Pediatrics |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=e15 |year=2000 |pmid=10617752 |doi=10.1542/peds.105.1.e15|doi-access=free }}</ref>

[[Stress (medicine)|Stress]] can influence a child's eating habits.

Feelings of depression can cause a child to overeat. Researchers provided an in-home interview to 9,374 adolescents, in grades seven through 12 and discovered that there was not a direct correlation with children eating in response to depression. Of all the obese adolescents, 8.2% had said to be depressed, compared to 8.9% of the non-obese adolescents who said they were depressed.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodman E, Whitaker RC |title=A prospective study of the role of depression in the development and persistence of adolescent obesity |journal=Pediatrics |volume=110 |issue=3 |pages=497–504 |year=2002 |pmid=12205250 |doi=10.1542/peds.110.3.497}}</ref> [[Antidepressants]], however, seem to have very little influence on childhood obesity.

Several studies have also explored the connection between [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)]] and obesity in children.

=== Lifestyle ===
Exclusive breast-feeding is recommended in all newborn infants for its nutritional and other beneficial effects.<ref name=naspghan2008/> Parents changing the diet and lifestyle of their offspring by offering appropriate food portions, increasing physical activity, and keeping sedentary behaviors at a minimum may also decrease the obesity levels in children.<ref name=Lancet2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Han JC, Lawlor DA, Kimm SY |title=Childhood obesity |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9727 |pages=1737–48 |date=May 2010 |pmid=20451244 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60171-7 |pmc=3073855}}</ref>

If children were more mobile and less sedentary, the rate of obesity would decrease. Parents should recognize the signs and encourage their children to be more physically active.

Since the onset of the 21st century, Australia has found that childhood obesity has followed trend with the United States. Information garnered has concluded that the increase has occurred in the lower socioeconomic areas where poor nutritional education has been blamed.

A study of 1800 children aged 2 to 12 in [[Colac, Victoria|Colac]], [[Australia]] tested a program of restricted diet (no carbonated drinks or sweets) and increased exercise. Interim results included a 68% increase in [[After School Activity|after school activity programs]], 21% reduction in television viewing, and an average of 1&nbsp;kg weight reduction compared to a control group.<ref>"[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/obesity-study-bears-fruit/2006/08/24/1156012648038.html Obesity study bears fruit]", ''[[Jamie Oliver]]'', 24 August 2006.</ref>

A survey carried out by the [[American Obesity Association]] into parental attitudes towards their children's weight showed the majority of parents think that recess should not be reduced or replaced. Almost 30% said that they were concerned with their child's weight. 35% of parents thought that their child's school was not teaching them enough about childhood obesity, and over 5% thought that childhood obesity was the greatest risk to their child's long-term health.<ref>[http://www.obesity.org/research/parent_survey.shtml Survey on parents' perceptions of their children's weight] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017001241/http://obesity.org/research/parent_survey.shtml |date=2007-10-17 }}, [[American Obesity Association]].

A [[Northwestern University]] study indicates that [[Sleep deprivation|inadequate sleep]] has a negative impact on a child's performance in school, their emotional and social welfare, and increases their risk of being overweight. This study was the first nationally represented, longitudinal investigation of the correlation between sleep, Body Mass Index (BMI) and overweight status in children between the ages of 3 and 18. The study found that an extra hour of sleep lowered the children's risk of being overweight from 36% to 30%, while it lessened older children's risk from 34% to 30%.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Snell E, Adam EK, Duncan GJ |date=January–February 2007 | title = Sleep and the Body Mass Index and Overweight Status of Children and Adolescents | journal = Child Development | pages=309–23 | volume = 78 | issue = 1 | pmid = 17328707 |doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.00999.x}}</ref>

Obese children and adolescents are more likely to become obese as adults. For example, one study found that approximately 80% of children who were overweight at aged 10–15 years were obese adults at age 25 years. Another study found that 25% of obese adults were overweight as children. The latter study also found that if overweight begins before 8 years of age, obesity in adulthood is likely to be more severe.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/index.html Childhood Overweight and Obesity], [[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].

A study has also found that tackling childhood obesity will not necessarily lead to eating disorders later in life.<ref>{{cite news|title=How To Deal With Overweight/Obese Children|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/chewing-the-fat-20101019-16s2d.html |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=19 October 2010 |accessdate=20 October 2010}}</ref>

A review of secular trends in the number of overweight or obese children have come to the conclusion  that prevalence had increased during the past two  decades in the most industrialised countries, apart from Russia and Poland, and in several low-income countries, especially in urban areas. Prevalence doubled or tripled between the early 1970s and late 1990s in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Japan, the UK, and the USA. By 2010, more than 40% of children in the North American and eastern Mediterranean WHO regions, 38% in Europe, 27% in the western Pacific, and 22% in southeast Asia were predicted to be overweight or obese. However, that 2006 review pre-dates recent data, which, although still too soon to be certain, suggest that the increase in childhood obesity in the US, the UK, and Sweden might be abating.3–5 <ref>{{cite journal|last=Han|first=Joan|author2=Debbie Lawor |author3=Sue YS Kimm |title=Child Obesity|date=6 May 2010|volume=375|issue=9727|pages=1737–1748|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)60171-7|journal=The Lancet|pmid=20451244|pmc=3073855}}<!--|accessdate=Dec 9, 2012--></ref>
