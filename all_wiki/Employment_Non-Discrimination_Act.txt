The '''Employment Non-Discrimination Act''' ('''ENDA''') is legislation proposed in the [[United States Congress]] that would prohibit [[discrimination]] in hiring and employment on the basis of [[sexual orientation]] or, depending on the version of the bill, [[gender identity]] by employers with at least 15 employees.

ENDA has been introduced in every Congress since 1994 except the [[109th United States Congress|109th]]. Similar legislation has been introduced without passage since 1974.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nondiscrimination legislation historical timeline|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/issues/nondiscrimination/timeline|publisher=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524062405/http://www.thetaskforce.org/issues/nondiscrimination/timeline|archive-date=May 24, 2014|accessdate=June 17, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The bill gained its best chance at passing after the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] gained the majority after [[Republican Revolution|twelve years]] of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] majorities in the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections.]] In 2007, [[gender identity]] protections were added to the legislation for the first time. Some sponsors believed that even with a Democratic majority, ENDA did not have enough votes to pass the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with [[transgender]] inclusion and dropped it from the bill, which passed the House and then died in the Senate. President [[George W. Bush]] threatened to veto the measure. LGBT advocacy organizations and the LGBT community were divided over support of the modified bill.

In 2009, following Democratic gains in the [[United States elections, 2008|2008 elections]], and after the divisiveness of the 2007 debate, Rep. [[Barney Frank]] introduced a transgender-inclusive version of ENDA. He introduced it again in 2011, and Senator [[Jeff Merkley]] introduced it in the Senate. On November 7, 2013, Merkley's bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support by a vote of 64–32. President [[Barack Obama]] supported the bill's passage, but the House Rules Committee voted against it.

From 2015 on, LGBT rights advocates moved to support the [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]], a bill with far more comprehensive protections than ENDA.<Ref>https://transequality.org/blog/the-equality-act-is-the-lgbt-rights-bill-we-want-and-need</ref><ref>https://www.glaad.org/vote/topics/equality-act</ref> The [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]] would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity not only in employment, but also housing, public accommodations, public education, federal funding, credit, and jury service.<ref>https://www.hrc.org/resources/the-equality-act</ref>

On June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia]]'' that Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] protects employees from discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.<ref>https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bostock-v-clayton-county-georgia/</ref> The ruling was only on employment, like ENDA. LGBT rights advocates welcomed the ruling and called on Congress to pass the [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]], noting that as of 2020, 29 states do not have the full protections the Equality Act would provide for the LGBT community.<ref>https://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc-supreme-court-is-on-right-side-of-history-for-lgbtq-rights</ref><ref>https://www.lambdalegal.org/blog/20200615_supreme-court-workplace-protections-lgbtq-employees</ref><ref>https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/06/15/one-colorado-lgbtq-supreme-court/</ref>

==Evidence of employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity==
{{Main|LGBT employment discrimination in the United States}}
In states that have anti-discrimination policies in place, LGBT complaints are equivalent to the number of complaints filed based on sex and fewer than the number of complaints filed based on race.<ref>{{cite web|title=The State of the Workplace: for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Americans|url=http://www.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/HRC_Foundation_State_of_the_Workplace_2007-2008.pdf|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>Evidence Discrimination based on sexual orientation occurs at a similar rate as sex and race at 4.7 per 10,000, as compared to discrimination based on sex at 5.4 and race at 6.5.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ramos|first=Christopher|title=Evidence of Employment Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity: Complaints Filed with State Enforcement Agencies, 1999–2007|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Badgett-Sears-Ramos-Emply-Discrim-1999-2007-Nov-08.pdf|publisher=The Williams Institute|accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref>  EEOC statistics [https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/sexual_harassment_new.cfm] from 2018, show that 1,811 LGBT complaints were filed. [https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/lgbt_sex_based.cfm]

The [[Williams Institute]] estimates the number of LGBT employees as follows: 7 million private sector employees, 1 million state and local employees, and 200,000 employees of the federal government. Thirty percent of state and local LGBT employees live in California and New York. In comparison, less than half of one half of one percent of LGBT state and local employees live in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming combined.<ref>{{cite web|title=Estimates of LGBT Public Employees|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/6cz123ww?display=all|publisher=The Williams Institute|accessdate=April 30, 2011}}</ref> As one might expect, many of the documented complaints of discrimination by state and local governments against LGBT employees are in California and New York. Surveys that seek to document discrimination on the basis of perceived sexual orientation and/or gender identity are often conducted with a pool of self identified LGBT people, making it difficult to ascertain the impact of this type of discrimination on non-LGBT individuals.

One source of evidence for [[hiring discrimination]] against openly gay men comes from a field experiment that sent two fictitious but realistic resumes to roughly 1,700 entry-level job openings. The two resumes were very similar in terms of the applicant's qualifications, but one resume for each opening mentioned that the applicant had been part of a gay organization in college. The results showed that applicants without the gay signal had an 11.5 percent chance of being called for an interview; openly gay applicants had only a 7.2 percent chance. The callback gap varied widely according to the location of the job. Most of the overall gap detected in the study was driven by the Southern and Midwestern states in the sample – Texas, Florida, and Ohio. The Western and Northeastern states in the sample (California, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and New York) had only small and statistically insignificant callback gaps.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/661653 Tilcsik, A. (2011). Pride and prejudice: Employment discrimination against openly gay men in the United States. American Journal of Sociology, 117, 586–626.]</ref>

Transgender people may experience higher rates of discrimination than the LGBT population. A survey of transgender and gender non-conforming people conducted by the [[National Center for Transgender Equality]] found 90 percent of respondents experienced harassment, mistreatment, or discrimination on the job or took actions like hiding who they are to avoid it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grant |first=Jamie M. |title=Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey. |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/reports_and_research/ntds |publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality and National Gay and Lesbian Task Force |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006061544/http://www.thetaskforce.org/reports_and_research/ntds |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }}</ref> In comparison, a review of studies conducted by the Williams Institute in 2007 found that transgender people experienced employment discrimination at a rate 15 to 57 percent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Badgette|first=M.V.

In a survey conducted by Harris Interactive, 38 percent of LGBT people report incomes less than $35,000, compared to 33 percent of all U.S. adults over age 18.<ref>{{cite web|last=Witeck|first=Bob|title=Ending Employment Discrimination in America: Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics About America's LGBT Families|url=http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2009/11/ending-employment-discrimination-in-america-lies-damned-lies-and-statistics-about-americas-lgbt-families.html|accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref>

==Provisions==
The current version of the bill under consideration in Congress prohibits private employers with more than 15 employees from discriminating on the basis of some sexual orientations or gender identity. Sexual orientation is limited to "homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality," thereby legalizing discrimination against asexual individuals. Religious organizations are provided an exception, broader than that found in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name=HuffPo>{{cite news|author=[[Jennifer Bendery]]|title=Gay Rights Groups Pull Support For ENDA Over Sweeping Religious Exemption|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/08/enda-religious-exemption_n_5568736.html|accessdate=16 August 2014|date=8 July 2014}}</ref> Non-profit membership-only clubs, except labor unions, are similarly exempt.

All versions of the bill, irrespective of the military's changing policies with respect to service by open gays and lesbians, have provided an exclusion for the military as an employer of members of the armed forces, though not as an employer of civilians.<ref>103rd Congress: "For purposes of this Act, the term 'employment or employment opportunities' does not apply to the relationship between the United States and members of the Armed Forces."; 112th Congress: "In this Act, the term 'employment' does not apply to the relationship between the United States and members of the Armed Forces."</ref>

Since the 111th Congress, the legislation has included language to prevent any reading of the law as a modification of the federal definition of marriage established in the Defense of Marriage Act (1995).<ref>111th and 112th Congresses: "In this Act, the term 'married' refers to marriage as such term is defined in section 7 of title 1, United States Code (commonly known as the 'Defense of Marriage Act')."</ref> Since the 110th Congress, a related provision aimed at non-marital legal relations like civil unions and domestic partnerships prevents requiring an employer to treat unmarried and married couples similarly.<ref>112th Congress: "Nothing in this Act shall be construed to require a covered entity to treat an unmarried couple in the same manner as the covered entity treats a married couple for purposes of employee benefits."</ref>

On May 14, 1974, Reps. [[Bella Abzug]] (D-NY) and [[Ed Koch]] (D-NY) introduced {{USBill|93|H.R.|14752}}, an "Equality Act" which would have added "sex, marital status or sexual orientation" to the protected classes specified in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], thus prohibiting discrimination in employment and access to public accommodations and facilities.<ref>(October 13, 2007) [http://www.stonewallvets.org/BellaAbzug.htm U.S. Congressmember Bella S.

In the [[110th United States Congress]] there were two versions of the bill, both of which provided employment protections similar to Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name=cra64>{{Cite web |url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |access-date=October 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021141154/http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |archive-date=October 21, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Reps. [[Barney Frank]], [[Chris Shays]], [[Tammy Baldwin]], and [[Deborah Pryce]] introduced {{USBill|110|H.R.|2015}} on April 24, 2007. It included [[gender identity]] within its protections. It defined gender identity as "gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to the individual's designated sex at birth." It allowed employers to require adherence "to the same dress or grooming standards for the gender to which the employee has transitioned or is transitioning."<ref>Weiss, Jillian Todd.

It was endorsed by the Education and Labor Committee on October 18 and the House of Representatives passed it on November 7, 2007, by a vote of 235 to 184, with 14 members not voting.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll1057.xml Final Vote Results For HR 3685]</ref> Frank introduced a separate piece of legislation to prohibit discrimination in employment on the basis of gender identity.<ref>Eleveld, Kerry.

On April 25, 2013, Representative [[Jared Polis]] (D-CO) introduced an ENDA bill in the House ({{USBill|113|H.R.|1755}}) and Senator [[Jeff Merkley]] (D-OR) introduced an ENDA bill in the Senate ({{USBill|113|S.|815}}).<ref>{{cite news|last=Benen|first=Steve|title=ENDA introduced with bipartisan backing|url=http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/04/25/17915739-enda-introduced-with-bipartisan-backing?lite|accessdate=April 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602104528/http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/04/25/17915739-enda-introduced-with-bipartisan-backing?lite|archive-date=June 2, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On July 10, 2013, the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee]] approved ENDA by a 15–7 vote.

===114th Congress onwards===
From the [[114th United States Congress|114th Congress]] onwards, efforts to pass non-discrimination legislation has focused on the broader [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]] which focuses on additional protections including in housing and the jury system as well as employment.

==Arguments==

===In favor of ENDA===
Political proponents of the law intend it to address cases where [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] employees have been discriminated against by their employers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Currently, these employees are unable to find protection in the courts because sexual orientation is not considered to be a [[suspect class]] by the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] and by many U.S. states. Proponents argue that such a law is appropriate in light of the [[United States Constitution]]'s guarantees of [[equal protection]] and [[due process]] to all. Advocates argue that homosexuality is not a "choice" but a personal identity, a claim supported by the [[American Psychology Association]] (APA), and that all working people have a right to be judged by the quality of their work performance and not by completely unrelated factors.<ref name= APA_ENDA>[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/employment-nondiscrimination.aspx# Examining the Employment Nondiscrimination Act (ENDA): The Scientists Perspective] American Psychological Association. Accessed May 22, 2010.</ref> According to a study published in 2001 by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, reports of discrimination based on sexual orientation are roughly equal to those on race or gender.<ref>Rubenstein, William B. (January 30, 2002) [http://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/programs/dogayrightslawsmatter.pdf Do Gay Rights Laws Matter?: An Empirical Assessment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625003440/http://www.law.ucla.edu/WilliamsInstitute/programs/dogayrightslawsmatter.pdf |date=June 25, 2010 }} The Williams Institute, UCLA School of Law. Accessed October 20, 2007.</ref> The APA also states that there is significant discrimination against homosexuals in the workforce.<ref name= APA_ENDA/>

The Congressional Budget Office in 2002 estimated that the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]'s complaint caseload would rise by 5 to 7% as a result of the proposed law.<ref>(April 24, 2002) [http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=3527&amp;sequence=0 CBO Cost Estimate: S. 1284 Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2002] Congressional Budget Office. Accessed October 20, 2007.</ref> Assessments of the impact of comparable state policies also show a minimal impact on caseload.<ref>{{cite web|title=Employment Discrimination against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People in Oklahoma|url=http://www3.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/Policy-Discrimination-index.html|work=The Williams Institute|accessdate=May 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320004612/http://www2.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/Policy-Discrimination-index.html|archive-date=March 20, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Regarding constitutionality, the act incorporates language similar to that of [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref name=cra64/> which has consistently been upheld by the courts.

In 1994, [[Barry Goldwater]], a hero among the [[conservative]] and [[libertarian]] movements, became honorary chairman of a drive to pass a federal law preventing job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Barry Goldwater, GOP Hero, Dies|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater30.htm|work=Washington Post|accessdate=November 2, 2013|date=June 5, 1998}}</ref>

===In opposition to ENDA===
Ed Vitagliano, director of research for the [[American Family Association]] (AFA), expressed concern about the impact of anti-discrimination laws on religious organizations. He cited a lack of clarity around whether the narrow exemption would apply to support staff and lay employees in addition to churches and clergy.<ref name="Vitagliano">{{cite web|last=Vitagliano|first=Ed|title=How ENDA Could Begin an Uncivil War|url=http://www.afajournal.org/0907ENDA.asp|work=American Family Association Journal|accessdate=April 30, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511233900/http://www.afajournal.org/0907ENDA.asp|archive-date=May 11, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[Traditional Values Coalition]] (TVC) has claimed that the legislation would have a negative impact on school children by eliminating schools' ability to avoid hiring transgender teachers. It said that "If ENDA passes, students and children in daycare centers all across the nation will be subjected to individuals experimenting with their gender identities."<ref>{{cite web|title=ENDA Hurts Kids: The Impact on Classrooms|url=http://traditionalvalues.org/data/sites/73/pdfs/_WPapers/070713_TVCELI_ENDA2013_FINAL.pdf|website=TVC Education & Legal Institute|publisher=Traditional Values Coalition|accessdate=July 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}{{dead link|date=January 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Some [[Libertarianism|Libertarians]] argue that laws against private sector discrimination are acts of [[coercion]] that infringe on employers' [[property rights]] and [[freedom of association]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Context Matters: A Better Libertarian Approach to Antidiscrimination Law|url=http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/06/16/david-bernstein/context-matters-a-better-libertarian-approach-to-antidiscrimination-law/|work=Cato Unbound|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}</ref>

The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] said ENDA goes beyond prohibiting unjust discrimination and poses several problems. It notes, for example, that the bill: (1) lacks an exception for a "[[bona fide occupational qualification]]," which exists for every other category of discrimination under [[Civil Rights Act 1964#Title VII|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act]], except for race; (2) lacks a distinction between [[homosexuality|homosexual inclination]] and [[Same-sex relationship#Same-sex sexuality|conduct]], thus affirming and protecting extramarital sexual conduct; (3) supports the redefinition of marriage, as state-level laws like ENDA have been invoked in state court decisions finding marriage discriminatory or irrational; (4) rejects the biological basis of gender by defining "[[gender identity]]" as something people may choose at variance with their [[biological sex]]; and (5) threatens [[religious liberty]] by punishing as discrimination the religious or moral disapproval of same-sex sexual conduct, while protecting only some religious employers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers About the Employee Non-Discrimination Act|url=http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/labor-employment/upload/enda-backgrounder-2013.pdf|work=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>

In June and July 2014, several pro-LGBT advocacy groups, including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]], [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]], [[Transgender Law Center]], and [[Lambda Legal]], announced they were withdrawing support for the 113th Congress version of ENDA because of their concerns about the breadth of its religious exemption in relation to the ruling in ''[[Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.]]''.<ref name="MyUser_The_Huffington_Post_July_13_2015c">{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/08/enda-religious-exemption_n_5568736.html |title=Gay Rights Groups Pull Support For ENDA Over Sweeping Religious Exemption |last1=Bendery |first1=Jennifer |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date= July 8, 2014 |accessdate= July 13, 2015}}</ref>
