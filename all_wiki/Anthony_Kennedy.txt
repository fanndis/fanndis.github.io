'''Anthony McLeod Kennedy''' (born July 23, 1936) is a retired American lawyer and jurist who served as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] from 1988 until his retirement in 2018. He was nominated to the court in 1987 by President [[Ronald Reagan]], and sworn in on February 18, 1988. After the retirement of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] in 2006, he was the [[swing vote]] on many of the [[Roberts Court]]'s 5–4 decisions.

Born in [[Sacramento, California]], Kennedy took over his father's legal practice in Sacramento after graduating from [[Harvard Law School]]. In 1975, President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Kennedy to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]. In November 1987, after [[Ronald Reagan Supreme Court candidates|two failed attempts]] at nominating a successor to Associate Justice [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.]], President Reagan nominated Kennedy to the Supreme Court. Kennedy won unanimous confirmation from the [[United States Senate]] in February 1988. Following the death of [[Antonin Scalia]] in February 2016, Kennedy became the Senior Associate Justice of the Court; he remained the Senior Associate Justice until his July 2018 retirement. Kennedy retired during the administration of President [[Donald Trump]] and was succeeded by his former law clerk, [[Brett Kavanaugh]].

Kennedy authored the majority opinion in several important cases, including ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'', ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'', and four [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] cases (''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'', and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''). He also co-authored the plurality opinion in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]''.

== Early life and education ==
Kennedy was born and raised in an [[Irish Catholic]] family in [[Sacramento, California]].<ref>{{cite book|author=William E. Watson and Eugene J.

== Early career ==
Kennedy was in private practice in San Francisco from 1961 to 1963. In 1963, following his father's death, he took over his father's Sacramento practice, which he operated until 1975.<ref name="supreme court" /> From 1965 to 1988, he was a Professor of Constitutional Law at [[McGeorge School of Law]], at the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]].<ref name="urlLII: US Supreme Court: Justice Kennedy" /> 

During Kennedy's time as a California law professor and attorney, he helped California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] draft a state tax proposal.<ref name="supreme court" />

Kennedy has served in numerous positions during his career, including the [[California Army National Guard]] in 1961 and the board of the [[Federal Judicial Center]] from 1987 to 1988. He also served on two committees of the [[Judicial Conference of the United States]]: the Advisory Panel on Financial Disclosure Reports and Judicial Activities (subsequently renamed the Advisory Committee on Codes of Conduct) from 1979 to 1987, and the Committee on Pacific Territories from 1979 to 1990, which he chaired from 1982 to 1990.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hon.Anthony M.Kennedy |url=https://worldjusticeproject.org/about-us/who-we-are/honorary-chairs/anthony-m_kennedy |website=worldjusticeproject.org |publisher=World Justice Project |accessdate=12 December 2019}}</ref>

==U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit==
On March 3, 1975, upon Reagan's recommendation,<ref name="supreme court" /> [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]] nominated Kennedy to the seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] that had been vacated by [[Charles Merton Merrill]].

In a Ninth Circuit dissent that Kennedy wrote before joining the Supreme Court, he criticized police for bribing a child into showing them where the child's mother hid drugs. Considering such conduct offensive and destructive of the family, Kennedy wrote that "indifference to personal liberty is but the precursor of the state's hostility to it."<ref>Greenburg, Jan Crawford. ''Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court''. 2007. Penguin Books. Page 55.</ref> Kennedy wrote an article the year before, however, about judicial restraint, and the following excerpt from it was read aloud{{By whom|date=June 2018}} at his confirmation hearing:

{{quote|One can conclude that certain essential, or fundamental, rights should exist in any just society. It does not follow that each of those essential rights is one that we as judges can enforce under the written Constitution. The Due Process Clause is not a guarantee of every right that should inhere in an ideal system. Many argue that a just society grants a right to engage in homosexual conduct. If that view is accepted, the ''Bowers'' decision in effect says the State of Georgia has the right to make a wrong decision—wrong in the sense that it violates some people's views of rights in a just society. We can extend that slightly to say that Georgia's right to be wrong in matters not specifically controlled by the Constitution is a necessary component of its own political processes. Its citizens have the political liberty to direct the governmental process to make decisions that might be wrong in the ideal sense, subject to correction in the ordinary political process.<ref>{{cite web

===Tenure and analysis===
Although appointed by a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] president, Kennedy was not easily pigeonholed ideologically; he had a reputation for looking at cases individually instead of deciding them on the basis of a rigid ideology.<ref name="supreme court" /> [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] quoted several former Supreme Court clerks as indicating that they believe Kennedy was often swayed by the opinions of his clerks, including his ruling on Roe v Wade.<ref name="VF2004"/> One clerk derisively stated that "the premise is that he can't think by himself, and that he can be manipulated by someone in his second year of law school". This notion also led the [[Federalist Society]] to target Kennedy with more conservative clerks, believing this would make Kennedy more conservative. Two of his former clerks, [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]], eventually became Supreme Court justices. Conservative pundit [[George Will]] and [[Georgetown University Law Center]] professor [[Randy Barnett]] have described Kennedy's jurisprudence as "[[Libertarianism|libertarian]]",<ref>'This Week,' ABC, July 1, 2012 and [[Randy Barnett|Barnett, Randy]] (July 10, 2003) [http://article.nationalreview.com/269324/kennedys-libertarian-revolution/randy-barnett Kennedy's Libertarian Revolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604104948/http://article.nationalreview.com/269324/kennedys-libertarian-revolution/randy-barnett |date=June 4, 2010 }}, ''[[National Review]]''.

Kennedy issued conservative rulings during most of his tenure, having voted with William Rehnquist as often as any other justice from 1992 to the end of the Rehnquist Court in 2005.<ref>Greenburg, Jan Crawford. ''Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court''. 2007. Penguin Books.

Page 85.</ref> However, Kennedy was also known for siding with the Court's liberal justices on high-profile social issues like same-sex marriage and abortion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-kennedy-cases-idUSKBN1JN3AF|title=Kennedy's departure puts abortion, gay rights in play at high court|date=June 28, 2018|via=www.reuters.com|newspaper=Reuters}}</ref> Kennedy was known as a swing vote on the Court,<ref name=swing>Bravin, Jess, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303627104576410051761796150 Court Conservatives Prevail] June 28, 2011.

On the Roberts Court, Kennedy often decided the outcome of cases. In the 2008–2009 term, he was in the majority 92 percent of the time. In the 23 decisions in which the justices split 5-to-4, Kennedy was in the majority in all but five. Of those 23 decisions, 16 were strictly along ideological lines, and Kennedy joined the conservative wing of the court 11 times; the liberals, five.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/us/01scotus.html | work=The New York Times | title=Roberts Court Shifts Right, Tipped by Kennedy | first=Adam | last=Liptak | date=July 1, 2009 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref> In the 2010–2011 term, 16 cases were decided by a 5–4 vote; Kennedy joined the majority in 14 of the decisions.<ref name=swing />

==== Conservative criticism ====

According to legal reporter [[Jan Crawford]], Kennedy attracted the ire of conservatives when he did not vote with his more conservative colleagues.<ref name="Greenburg, Jan Crawford 2007. Page 86, 162">Greenburg, Jan Crawford. ''Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court''. 2007. Penguin Books. Pages 86, 162.</ref> In 2005, [[Tom DeLay]] criticized Kennedy for his reliance on international law and for conducting his own Internet research, calling him a [[judicial activism|judicial activist]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7550959|title=DeLay slams Supreme Court Justice Kennedy: Lashes out at other judges, calling them 'judicial activists{{'-}}|agency=Associated Press|publisher=MSNBC|date=April 20, 2005|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref> According to legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, some conservatives viewed Kennedy's pro-gay-rights and pro-choice rulings as betrayals.<ref name="swing shift" /> According to Greenburg, the "bitter" quality of some movement conservatives' views on Kennedy stems from his eventual rethinking of positions on abortion, religion, and the death penalty (which Kennedy believes should not be applied to juveniles or the intellectually disabled).<ref name="Greenburg, Jan Crawford 2007. Page 86, 162" />

A short 2008 law review article by retired lawyer Douglas M. Parker in ''[[The Green Bag (1997)|The Green Bag]]''<ref>Justice Kennedy: The Swing Justice and his Critics, 11 Green Bag 317 (2008)</ref> charged that much of the criticism of Kennedy was based upon "[[Popular psychology|pop psychology]]" rather than careful analysis of his opinions. Kennedy himself responds to concerns about judicial activism this way: "An activist court is a court that makes a decision you don't like."<ref>Matt Sedensky,{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iWhwP-GmuptNw-uw8t8Z_lb1YV2QD9FMQKRG0 |title=Justice questions way court nominees are grilled |accessdate=June 5, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605163057/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iWhwP-GmuptNw-uw8t8Z_lb1YV2QD9FMQKRG0 |archivedate=June 5, 2010  }}, Associated Press, May 14, 2010. Retrieved May 14, 2010.</ref>

==== Internationalism ====
According to legal writer [[Jeffrey Toobin]], starting in 2003, Kennedy became a leading proponent of the use of foreign and international law as an aid to interpreting the United States Constitution.<ref name="swing shift" /> Toobin sees this consideration of foreign law as the biggest factor behind Kennedy's occasional breaking with his most conservative colleagues.<ref name="swing shift" /> The use of foreign law in Supreme Court opinions dates back to at least 1829, though according to Toobin, its use in interpreting the Constitution on "basic questions of individual liberties" began only in the late 1990s.<ref name="swing shift">{{cite news |last=Toobin |first=Jeffrey |url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/09/12/050912fa_fact |title=Swing Shift: How Anthony Kennedy's passion for foreign law could change the Supreme Court |work=The New Yorker |date=September 12, 2005 |accessdate=May 4, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110430023239/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/09/12/050912fa_fact| archivedate= April 30, 2011 |url-status= live}}</ref>

Defending his use of international law, in 2005 Kennedy told ''[[The New Yorker]]'' staff writer [[Jeffrey Toobin]], "Why should world opinion care that the American Administration wants to bring freedom to oppressed peoples? Is that not because there's some underlying common mutual interest, some underlying common shared idea, some underlying common shared aspiration, underlying unified concept of what human dignity means? I think that's what we're trying to tell the rest of the world, anyway."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Swing Shift |url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/09/12/050912fa_fact |work=The New Yorker |author=Jeffrey Toobin |date=September 12, 2005 |accessdate=June 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100719232710/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/09/12/050912fa_fact| archivedate= July 19, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

A 2008 profile of Kennedy in the ''Los Angeles Times'' focused on his internationalist perspective. According to David Savage, Kennedy had become a strong proponent of interpreting the guarantees of liberty and equality in line with modern human rights law: "lawyers and judges have come to believe the basic principles of human rights are common to the peoples of world."<ref>{{cite news|title=A justice's international view|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/14/nation/na-scotus14|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 11, 2012|author=Savage, David G.|date=June 14, 2008}}</ref>

==Jurisprudence==
=== Abortion ===

In ''[[Hodgson v. Minnesota]]'',  497 U.S. 417 (1990), Kennedy voted to uphold a restriction on abortion for minors that required both parents to be notified about the procedure.

Kennedy joined O'Connor's [[plurality opinion]] in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), which reaffirmed in principle (though without many details) the ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision recognizing the right to abortion under the [[Due Process]] Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The plurality opinion, signed jointly by three justices appointed by [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]], ignited a firestorm of criticism from conservatives. Kennedy had stated at least as early as 1989 that, in order to uphold precedent, he might not vote to overturn ''Roe''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Greenburg |first=Jan Crawford |title=Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court |location=New York |year=2007 |publisher=Penguin Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/supremeconflicti00gree/page/80 80] |isbn=978-1-59420-101-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/supremeconflicti00gree |url-access=registration }}</ref> According to court insiders, Kennedy had reportedly considered overturning ''Roe'', but in the end decided to uphold restrictions while affirming the ''Roe'' precedent.<ref>{{cite book |first=David G. |last=Savage |title=Turning Right: The Making of the Rehnquist Supreme Court |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |year=1993 |isbn=0-471-59553-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/turningrightmaki00sava/page/268 268–269, 288, 466–471] |url=https://archive.org/details/turningrightmaki00sava/page/268 }}</ref>

In later abortion decisions, it became apparent that Kennedy thought ''Casey'' had narrowed ''Roe'' and allowed more restrictions. Owing to the Court's altered composition under President Clinton, Kennedy was no longer the fifth vote to strike down abortion restrictions. Hence, O'Connor became the justice who defined the meaning of ''Casey'' in subsequent cases, while Kennedy was relegated to dissents in which he sought to explain what he thought ''Casey'' meant. For example, Kennedy dissented in the 2000 decision in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', which struck down laws criminalizing [[partial-birth abortion]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Frank J. |last=Colucci |title=Justice Kennedy's jurisprudence: the full and necessary meaning of liberty |location=Lawrence |publisher=University of Kansas Press |year=2009 |page=58 |isbn=978-0-7006-1662-6 }}</ref>

After the judicial appointments made by President George W. Bush, Kennedy again became the needed fifth vote to strike down abortion restrictions.{{pov statement|date=September 2020}} Since Kennedy's conception of abortion rights was narrower than O'Connor's, the Court became slightly more supportive of abortion restrictions after 2006. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', 550 U.S. 124 (2007), which held that a federal law criminalizing partial-birth abortion did not violate ''Casey'' because it did not impose an "undue burden" upon the exercise of abortion rights. The decision did not expressly overrule ''Stenberg'', although many commentators saw it as having that effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-380.pdf |title=05-380&nbsp;– Gonzales v.

=== Capital punishment ===

With the Court's majority in ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'' and ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'', Kennedy agreed that the execution of the mentally ill and those under 18 at the time of the crime was unconstitutional. In ''[[Kansas v. Marsh]]'', however, he declined to join the dissent, which questioned the overall "soundness" of the existing capital punishment system.

In 2008, Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]''. The opinion, joined by the court's four more liberal justices, held, "[t]he [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] bars Louisiana from imposing the death penalty for the rape of a child where the crime did not result, and was not intended to result, in the victim's death." The opinion went on to state, "The court concludes that there is a distinction between intentional first-degree murder, on the one hand, and non-homicide crimes against individuals, even including child rape, on the other. The latter crimes may be devastating in their harm, as here, but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public, they cannot compare to murder in their severity and irrevocability." The opinion concluded that in cases of crimes against individuals, "the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-343.ZO.html |title=Opinion of the court, authored by Kennedy – Part IV-A paragraph 7 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=May 4, 2011}}</ref>

=== Environment ===

Kennedy wrote the majority decision in ''[[Coeur Alaska, Inc. v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council]]'' (2009), which involved an Alaskan mining company that planned to extract new gold from a mine that had been closed for decades using a technique known as "froth-flotation". This technique would produce approximately 4.5&nbsp;million tons of "slurry", a thick waste product laced with toxic elements such as lead and mercury. The company intended to dispose of the waste in a nearby lake, which would eventually decrease the depth of the lake by fifty feet and flood the surrounding land with contaminated water. While federal law forbids "[t]he use of any river, lake, stream or ocean as a waste treatment system", Kennedy's decision stated that pollutants are exempt from this law so long as they have "the effect of ... changing the bottom elevation of water". Justice Ginsburg's dissent stated that such a reading of federal law "strains credulity" because it allows "[w]hole categories of regulated industries" to "gain immunity from a variety of pollution-control standards".

=== Gay rights and homosexuality ===

Kennedy's concept of liberty has included protections for sexual orientation. As early as 1980, then-Judge Kennedy speculated that some homosexual behavior is constitutionally protected.<ref>[[Michael Klarman]], [http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/vol127_klarman.pdf ''The Supreme Court, 2012 Term – Comment: Windsor and Brown: Marriage Equality and Racial Equality'', 127 ''Harvard Law Review'' 127, 138 (2013)] citing [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8185195466571647567&as_sdt=2006 ''Beller v. Middendorf'', 632 F.2d 788 (9th Cir. 1980)] (Finding the Navy could discharge sailors at [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] for engaging in homosexual acts).</ref> He wrote the Court's opinion in the 1996 case ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', invalidating a provision in the [[Colorado Constitution]] denying homosexuals the right to bring local discrimination claims. In 2003, he wrote the Court's opinion in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which invalidated criminal laws against homosexual [[sodomy]] on the basis of the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], overturning the Court's previous ruling in 1986's ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]''. In both cases, he sided with the more liberal members of the Court. He wrote that the Court had misread the historical record regarding laws criminalizing homosexual relations in ''Bowers'', stating that further research showed that American anti-sodomy laws had historically been directed at "nonprocreative sexual activity more generally," rather than specifically at homosexual acts. Combined with the fact that such laws had often gone unenforced, the Court saw this as constituting a tradition of avoiding interference with private sexual activity between consenting adults. He also said that the reasoning behind ''Bowers'' was not accepted by the United States government (as in the Model Penal Code's recommendations starting in 1955) and that it had rejected by most other developed Western countries (as in the [[Wolfenden Report]] of 1957 and a 1981 decision of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Case 7525/76 ''[[Dudgeon v United Kingdom]]''). As a result, Kennedy stated that there was a jurisprudential basis for thinking that "an integral part of human freedom" is allowing consenting adults to choose to privately engage in sexual activity.<ref>{{harvp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§18.28(b)}}, quoting ''Lawrence'', 539 U.S. at 566.</ref><ref>Colucci, ''Justice Kennedy's jurisprudence'' ch. 4</ref>

In the 2000 case of ''[[Boy Scouts of America v. Dale]]'', Kennedy voted, with four other justices, to uphold the [[Boy Scouts of America]]'s organizational right to ban homosexuals from being scoutmasters.

On October 19, 2009, Kennedy temporarily blocked Washington state officials from releasing the names of people who signed petitions calling for a referendum ballot measure that would repeal a gay rights domestic partnership law, but joined the subsequent majority decision in ''[[Doe v. Reed]]'', which stated the Washington law permitting signature release was constitutional, but remanded the matter to the lower court to determine whether the release of this particular petition's signatures was constitutional.

In the 2010 case ''[[Christian Legal Society v. Martinez]]'', the Court held that a public law college's policy requiring that all student organizations allow any student to join was constitutional. The Christian Legal Society wanted an exemption from the policy because the organization barred students based on religion and sexual orientation. [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law|Hastings College of Law]] refused to grant the exemption. The Court found that Hastings' policy was reasonable and viewpoint neutral. Kennedy wrote a concurrence joining the majority.

On June 26, 2013, Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] was held unconstitutional in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]''. In the majority opinion on this case, Kennedy wrote, "The federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity. By seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others, the federal statute is in violation of the Fifth Amendment."<ref>{{cite news|title=Supreme Court of the United States|url=http://schuhlaw.com/12-307_g2bh.pdf|publisher=Supreme Court of the United States|accessdate=June 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527220235/http://schuhlaw.com/12-307_g2bh.pdf|archive-date=May 27, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Two years later, Kennedy authored the majority ruling in the decision of ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'', which holds that same-sex couples must be [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|allowed to marry]] nationwide.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Obergefell, et al. v.

=== Gun control ===

On June 26, 2008, Kennedy joined the majority in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'', which struck down the ban on handguns in the [[District of Columbia]]. At issue was whether Washington, D.C.'s ban violated the right to "keep and bear arms" by preventing individuals from having guns in their homes. Kennedy sided with the conservatives on the Court, holding that the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] recognized an individual's right to keep and bear arms. (The decision came the day after the Court's ruling in ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'', a capital punishment decision written by Kennedy, in which he sided with the liberal justices.) Two years later, in ''[[McDonald v. Chicago]]'', Kennedy joined the majority opinion holding that the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]]'s protections for the [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|right to keep and bear arms]] are [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporated]] against the states through the [[Due Process Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rose |first1=Veronica |title=SUMMARY OF THE RECENT MCDONALD V.

=== Habeas corpus ===

On June 12, 2008, Kennedy wrote the 5–4 majority opinion in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]''. The case challenged the legality of Lakhdar Boumediene's detention at the Guantanamo Bay military base as well as the constitutionality of the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006|Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006]]. Kennedy was joined by the four more liberal judges in finding that the constitutionally guaranteed right of [[habeas corpus]] applies to persons held in Guantanamo Bay and to persons designated as enemy combatants on that territory. They also found that the [[Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]] failed to provide an adequate substitute for habeas corpus and that the MCA was an unconstitutional suspension of that right.<ref name=AssociatedPress20080612-a>{{cite news

The Court also concluded that the detainees are not required to exhaust review procedures in the court of appeals before seeking habeas relief in the district court.

===Religious liberty===
On issues of religion, Kennedy held to a less separationist reading of the [[Establishment Clause]] than did his colleague, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,{{cn|date=April 2019}} favoring a "Coercion Test" that he detailed in ''[[County of Allegheny v.

On October 25, 2011, [[Richard L.

According to Hasen, the rise of super PACs dates to a sentence in Kennedy's opinion in ''[[Citizens United v.

Kennedy has joined with Court majorities in decisions favoring [[states' rights]] and invalidating federal and state [[affirmative action]] programs. He ruled with the majority on Equal Protection grounds in the controversial 2000 ''[[Bush v.

''Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court''. 2007. Penguin Books. Page 17.</ref> Several weeks later, in the controversial case of ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]'' (2005), he joined the four more liberal justices in supporting the local government's power to take private property for economic development through the use of eminent domain.<ref>Greenburg, Jan Crawford. ''Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court''. 2007. Penguin Books. Page 18.</ref>

In ''Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Ayers'' (2003), Kennedy wrote a partial dissent in which he argued that railroad workers who had contracted asbestosis from their employment should not be entitled to recovery for the emotional pain and suffering from their increased risk of cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/01-963.ZX.html |title=Norfolk & Western R.&nbsp;Co.

In ''[[Baze v. Rees]]'', Kennedy played a deciding role in the outcome of lethal injection. Some correspondents believed he would play a larger role, believing more than two judges would dissent.<ref>{{cite web|title=At The Supreme Court It's Kennedy's World|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18567_162-3312314.html|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=April 11, 2012|author=Andrew Cohen}}</ref>

A December 2011 article in the ''Huffington Post'' noted that Kennedy dissented on an interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses, where a lab tech who created a forensic report on a case is required to testify at trial if called. His dissent, joined by Roberts, Breyer, and Alito, claimed that the rule would place a burden on understaffed labs. However, in ''Williams v. Illinois'', Kennedy sided with Scalia's interpretation of the amendment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Justice Anthony Kennedy Confronts Sixth Amendment Case, Hints At Change Of Heart, Cites Hamlet|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/06/justice-anthony-kennedy-sixth-amendment-hamlet_n_1132620.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=April 11, 2012|author=Sacks, Mike|date=December 6, 2011}}</ref>

== Public speaking and teaching ==
Kennedy called for reform of overcrowded [[Prisons in the United States|American prisons]] in a speech before the [[American Bar Association]]. He has spent his summers in [[Salzburg]], Austria, where he teaches international and American law at the University of Salzburg for the [[McGeorge School of Law]] international program and has attended the large yearly international judges' conference held there.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mcgeorge.edu/Anthony_Kennedy.htm |title= Anthony Kennedy|publisher = University of the Pacific |accessdate= October 29, 2013}}</ref>
