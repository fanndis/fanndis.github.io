==History==
{{Main|History of the United Arab Emirates}}

Human occupation has been traced back to the emergence of anatomically modern humans from Africa some 124,000 BCE through finds at the Faya-2 site in [[Mleiha Archaeological Centre|Mleiha]], [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]]. Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Known as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] to the [[Sumer]]ians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar period]] which traded between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], [[Dilmun|Bahrain]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as [[Iran]], [[Bactria]] and the [[Levant]]. The ensuing [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq period]] and three [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Dibba]]. The UAE' history of trade led to the emergence of [[Julfar]], in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].

Following decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of the [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|General Maritime Treaty]] with the British in 1820 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]]. This arrangement ended with independence and the establishment of the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971 following the British withdrawal from its treaty obligations. Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971; the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on 10 February 1972.<ref>{{Cite book |title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Motivate|year=2004|isbn=978-1860631672|location=|page=370}}</ref>

Stone tools recovered reveal a settlement of people from [[Africa]] some 127,000 years ago and a stone tool used for butchering animals discovered on the Arabian coast suggests an even older habitation from 130,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/uae/uae-archaeologist-discovers-the-swiss-army-knife-from-130-000-years-ago|title = UAE archaeologist discovers the Swiss Army knife from 130,000 years ago|last = Pennington|first = Roberta|date = 5 February 2014|work = The National |access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref> There is no proof of contact with the outside world at that stage, although in time lively trading links developed with civilisations in [[Mesopotamia]], Iran and the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan culture]] of the Indus Valley. This contact persisted and became wider, probably motivated by the trade in copper from the [[Al Hajar Mountains|Hajar Mountains]], which commenced around 3,000 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adias-uae.com/ |title=Abu Dhabi Islands Archaeological Survey (ADIAS) |publisher=Adias-uae.com |access-date=12 February 2016 }}</ref> Sumerian sources talk of UAE as home to the 'Makkan' or [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Early History of Civilisation|last=Woolley|first=Leonard|publisher=UNESCO|year=1963|isbn=|location=|page=611}}</ref>

There are six periods of human settlement with distinctive behaviours in UAE before Islam, which include the [[Hafit period]] from 3,200 to 2,600 BCE, the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar culture]] spanned from 2,600 to 2,000 BCE, the [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq people]] dominated from 2,000 to 1,300 BCE. From 1,200 BCE to the advent of [[Islam]] in Eastern Arabia, through three distinctive [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] and the Mleiha period, the area was variously occupied by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]]s and other forces, and saw the construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry thanks to the development of the [[Qanat|falaj]] irrigation system.

In ancient times, Al Hasa (today's Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia) was part of Al Bahreyn and adjoined Greater Oman (today's UAE and [[Oman]]). From the second century CE, there was a movement of tribes from Al Bahreyn towards the lower Gulf, together with a migration among the Azdite Qahtani (or Yamani) and Quda'ah tribal groups from south-west Arabia towards central Oman.

===Islam===
The spread of Islam to the North Eastern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the Islamic Prophet, [[Muhammad]], to the rulers of Oman in 630 CE, nine years after the [[Hegira|hijrah]]. This led to a group of rulers travelling to [[Medina]], converting to Islam and subsequently driving a successful uprising against the unpopular Sasanids, who dominated the Northern coasts at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Bey|first=Frauke|work=Longman|year=1996|isbn=978-0582277281|location=UK|page=127}}</ref> Following the death of Muhammad, the new Islamic communities south of the Persian Gulf threatened to disintegrate, with insurrections against the Muslim leaders. The [[Abu Bakr|Caliph Abu Bakr]] sent an army from the capital Medina which completed its reconquest of the territory ([[Ridda wars|the Ridda Wars]]) with the [[Battle of Dibba]] in which 10,000 lives are thought to have been lost.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Bey|first=Frauke|work=Longman|year=1996|isbn=978-0582277281|location=UK|pages=127–128}}</ref> This assured the integrity of the [[Caliphate]] and the unification of the Arabian Peninsula under the newly emerging [[Rashidun Caliphate]].

In 637, Julfar (in the area of today's Ras Al Khaimah) was an important port that was used as a staging post for the Islamic invasion of the [[Sassanian Empire|Sasanian Empire]].<ref name="AbedHellyer2001">{{cite book|author1=Ibrahim Abed|author2=Peter Hellyer|title=United Arab Emirates, a New Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcMz3zV0qAMC&pg=PA83|year= 2001|work=Trident Ltd|isbn=978-1-900724-47-0|pages=83–84}}</ref> The area of the Al Ain/Buraimi Oasis was known as Tu'am and was an important trading post for camel routes between the coast and the Arabian interior.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last = Bey|first = Frauke|work= Longman|year = 1996|isbn = 978-0582277281|location = UK|pages = 22–23}}</ref>

The earliest [[Christianity|Christian]] site in the UAE was first discovered in the 1990s, an extensive monastic complex on what is now known as [[Sir Bani Yas|Sir Bani Yas Island]] and which dates back to the 7th century. Thought to be [[Nestorian]] and built in 600 CE, the church appears to have been abandoned peacefully in 750 CE.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/ancient-secrets-of-sir-bani-yas-island-unveiled|title = Ancient secrets of Sir Bani Yas unveiled|last = Thomas|first = Jen|date = 12 December 2012|work = The National|access-date = 19 February 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103357/http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/ancient-secrets-of-sir-bani-yas-island-unveiled|archivedate = 22 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> It forms a rare physical link to a legacy of Christianity which is thought to have spread across the peninsula from 50 to 350 CE following trade routes. Certainly, by the 5th century, Oman had a bishop named John – the last bishop of Oman being Etienne, in 676 CE.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Trucial States|last = Hawley|first = Donald|work= Allen & Unwin|year = 1971|isbn = 978-0049530058|location = UK|pages = 48–51}}</ref>

The harsh desert environment led to the emergence of the "versatile tribesman", nomadic groups who subsisted due to a variety of economic activities, including animal husbandry, agriculture and hunting. The seasonal movements of these groups led to not only frequent clashes between groups but also the establishment of seasonal and semi-seasonal settlements and centres.

British bloody expeditions to protect the Indian trade led to campaigns against Ras Al Khaimah and other harbours along the coast, including the [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1809|Persian Gulf Campaign of 1809]] and the more successful [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1819|campaign of 1819]]. The following year, Britain and a number of local rulers signed a [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|maritime truce]], giving rise to the term [[Trucial States]], which came to define the status of the coastal emirates. A further treaty was signed in 1843 and, in 1853 the Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Truce was agreed. To this was added the 'Exclusive Agreements', signed in 1892, which made the [[Trucial States]] a British protectorate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.na.ae/en/education/historicalperiods/britishprince.aspx|title=British Era|website=www.na.ae|access-date=18 July 2018}}</ref>

Under the 1892 treaty, the trucial sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to the British and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the British without their consent. In return, the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack. The Exclusive Agreement was signed by the Rulers of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah and [[Umm Al Quwain]] between 6 and 8 March 1892. It was subsequently ratified by the [[Viceroy of India]] and the British Government in London.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} British maritime policing meant that pearling fleets could operate in relative security.

In 1869, the Qubaisat tribe settled at [[Khawr al Udayd]] and tried to enlist the support of the Ottomans, whose flag was occasionally seen flying there. Khawr al Udayd was claimed by Abu Dhabi at that time, a claim supported by the British. In 1906, the British Political Resident, [[Percy Cox]], confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan]] ('Zayed the Great') that Khawr al Udayd belonged to his sheikhdom.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=Keepers of the Golden Shore: A History of the United Arab Emirates |year=2016|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn= 978-1780235806|pages=49–50 |url=http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/display.asp?ISB=9781780235806 |access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref>

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[pearl hunting|pearling industry]] thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf. The [[First World War]] had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the [[depression (economics)|economic depression]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the [[cultured pearl]], that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the [[Second World War]], when the newly independent [[Government of India]] imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |title=UAE History & Traditions: Pearls & pearling |work=UAEinteract |access-date=12 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206103534/http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |archivedate=6 February 2016  }}</ref>

In 1922, the British government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1860633119|location = UAE|pages = 41–42}}</ref> APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of £1 million.

The British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven [[sheikhs]] of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office. In 1952, they formed the Trucial States Council,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nasibbitar.net/adi_sr/DocumentsArticle4.jpg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803020019/http://nasibbitar.net/adi_sr/DocumentsArticle4.jpg|archivedate=3 August 2008|title=Al Khaleej News Paper}}</ref> and appointed [[Adi Bitar]], Dubai's [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Sheikh Rashid]]'s legal advisor, as Secretary General and Legal Advisor to the council. The council was terminated once the United Arab Emirates was formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.info/flags/ae_tsc.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011257/http://www.fotw.net/flags/ae_tsc.html |archivedate=29 April 2011 |title=Trucial States Council until 1971 (United Arab Emirates) |publisher=Flags of the World |url-status=live }}</ref> The tribal nature of society and the lack of definition of borders between emirates frequently led to disputes, settled either through mediation or, more rarely, force. The [[Trucial Oman Scouts]] was a small military force used by the British to keep the peace.

In 1953, a subsidiary of BP, D'Arcy Exploration Ltd, obtained an offshore concession from the ruler of Abu Dhabi. BP joined with [[Compagnie Française des Pétroles]] (later [[Total S.A.|Total]]) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA). A number of undersea oil surveys were carried out, including one led by the famous marine explorer [[Jacques Cousteau]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cousteau|first1=Jacques|title=Calypso explores for underwater oil |url=https://www.librarything.com/work/18080895 |journal=National Geographic Magazine|date=August 1955|volume=CVIII|issue=2 |access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=Calypso in the Arabian Gulf: Jacques Cousteau's Undersea Survey of 1954|journal=Liwa|date=June 2015|volume=7|issue=13|pages=3–28|url=https://www.academia.edu/13056568|access-date=27 November 2016}}</ref> In 1958, a floating platform rig was towed from Hamburg, Germany, and positioned over the Umm Shaif pearl bed, in Abu Dhabi waters, where drilling began. In March, it struck oil in the Upper Thamama, a rock formation that would provide many valuable oil finds. This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962. ADMA made further offshore discoveries at Zakum and elsewhere, and other companies made commercial finds such as the Fateh oilfield off Dubai and the Mubarak field off Sharjah (shared with Iran).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Butt|first1=Gerald|title=Oil and Gas in the UAE|url=https://www.uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/11.pdf|website=UAE Interact|access-date=19 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123003948/http://www.uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/11.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2015}}</ref>

Meanwhile, onshore exploration was hindered by territorial disputes. In 1955, the United Kingdom represented Abu Dhabi and Oman in their dispute with Saudi Arabia over the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi Oasis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5444.htm|title=United Arab Emirates (06/07)|publisher=State.gov|access-date=12 February 2016}}</ref> A 1974 agreement between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia seemed to have settled the Abu Dhabi-Saudi [[Territorial dispute|border dispute]], but this has not been ratified.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Matthew|title=Global Security Watch – Saudi Arabia|year= 2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=978-0-313-38699-2|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxvFBAAAQBAJ|access-date=20 June 2015}}</ref> The UAE's border with Oman was ratified in 2008.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/government/historic-uae-oman-accord-involves-272km-of-border-1.119592|title=Historic UAE-Oman accord involves 272km of border|date = 22 July 2008|work = Gulf News |access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref>

PDTC continued its onshore exploration away from the disputed area, drilling five more bore holes that were also dry. However, on 27 October 1960, the company discovered oil in commercial quantities at the Murban No. 3 well on the coast near Tarif.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1860633119|location = UAE|pages = 413–416}}</ref> In 1962, PDTC became the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company. As oil revenues increased, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], undertook a massive construction program, building schools, housing, hospitals and roads. When Dubai's oil exports commenced in 1969, Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], the ruler of Dubai, was able to invest the revenues from the limited reserves found to spark the diversification drive that would create the modern [[global city]] of Dubai.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14703998|title=Middle East &#124; Country profile: United Arab Emirates|work=BBC News|date=11 March 2009}}</ref>

===Independence===
[[File:Flag-hoisting at the Union Declaration.jpg|thumb|left|Historic photo depicting the first hoisting of the United Arab Emirates flag by the rulers of the emirates at The Union House, Dubai on 2 December 1971]]
[[File:UAE Father of the Nation.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]] was the first President of the United Arab Emirates and is recognised as the father of the nation.]]
By 1966, it had become clear the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] could no longer afford to administer and protect what is now the United Arab Emirates. British [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) debated the preparedness of the [[Royal Navy]] to defend the sheikhdoms. [[Secretary of State for Defence]] [[Denis Healey]] reported that the [[British Armed Forces]] were seriously overstretched and in some respects dangerously under-equipped to defend the sheikhdoms. On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] announced the government's decision, reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], to end the treaty relationships with the seven Trucial Sheikhdoms, that had been, together with Bahrain and Qatar, under British protection. Days after the announcement, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], fearing vulnerability, tried to persuade the British to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the [[British Armed Forces]] in the Emirates. The British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government rejected the offer.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gornall, Jonathan |date=2 December 2011 |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/sun-sets-on-british-empire-as-uae-raises-its-flag#page5 |title=Sun sets on British Empire as UAE raises its flag |work=The National|location=Abu Dhabi}}</ref> After Labour MP [[Goronwy Roberts, Baron Goronwy-Roberts|Goronwy Roberts]] informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of British withdrawal, the nine Persian Gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of Arab emirates, but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guide.theemiratesnetwork.com/basics/history_of_the_emirates.php |title=History the United Arab Emirates (UAE)&nbsp;– TEN Guide |work=Guide.theemiratesnetwork.com |date=11 February 1972 }}</ref>

Fears of vulnerability were realised the day before independence. An Iranian destroyer group broke formation from an exercise in the lower Gulf, sailing to the [[Tunb islands]]. The islands were taken by force, civilians and Arab defenders alike allowed to flee. A British warship stood idle during the course of the invasion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tonb |title=Tonb Islands (Greater and Lesser), two tiny islands of arguable strategic importance in the eastern Persian Gulf, south of the western tip of Qešm island |last1=Mirfendereski |first1=Guive |date=25 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704222708/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tonb |archive-date=4 July 2015 }}</ref> A destroyer group approached the island [[Abu Musa]] as well. But there, Sheikh [[Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi]]  had already negotiated with the Iranian Shah, and the island was quickly leased to Iran for $3 million a year. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia laid claim to swathes of Abu Dhabi.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Krane |first1=Jim |year=2009 |title=City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism |pages=81–84}}</ref>

Originally intended to be part of the proposed Federation of Arab Emirates, Bahrain became independent in August, and Qatar in September 1971. When the British-Trucial Sheikhdoms treaty expired on 1 December 1971, both emirates became fully independent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-1021.html |title=Bahrain&nbsp;– Indpendence |publisher=Country-data.com }}</ref> On 2 December 1971, at the Dubai Guesthouse (now known as Union House) six of the emirates (Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain)  agreed to enter into a union called the United Arab Emirates.

The four colours of the flag are the [[Pan-Arab colours]] red, green, white, and black, and represent the unity of the Arab nations. It was adopted on 2 December 1971.

The United Arab Emirates is situated in Middle East, bordering the [[Gulf of Oman]] and the [[Persian Gulf]], between Oman and Saudi Arabia; it is in a strategic location slightly south of the [[Strait of Hormuz]], a vital transit point for world [[Petroleum|crude oil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uae.gov.ae/Government/oil_gas.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705161411/http://www.uae.gov.ae/Government/oil_gas.htm|archivedate=5 July 2008 |title=UAE Oil and Gas |publisher=Uae.gov.ae |date=19 June 1999 }}</ref>

The UAE lies between 22°30' and 26°10' north latitude and between 51° and 56°25′ east longitude. It shares a {{convert|530|km|mi|adj=on}} border with Saudi Arabia on the west, south, and southeast, and a {{convert|450|km|mi|adj=on}} border with Oman on the southeast and northeast.

Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar. The smaller islands, as well as many [[coral reef]]s and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore. The UAE also has a stretch of the [[Al Batinah Region|Al Bāţinah]] coast of the Gulf of Oman, although the [[Musandam Governorate|Musandam Peninsula]], the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz, is an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] of Oman separated by the UAE.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

South and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling [[dune|sand dunes]] merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia. The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation. The extensive [[Liwa Oasis]] is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia. About {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} to the northeast of Liwa is the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Al-Buraimi]] oasis, which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi-Oman border.

Prior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the [[Al Hajar Mountains|Al-Hajar al-Gharbi]] Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves.

[[File:1501200713074 Acacia tortilis.jpg|thumb|[[Acacia]] trees growing in desert suburbs near [[Fujairah]]]]
The oases grow [[Phoenix dactylifera|date palms]], [[acacia]] and [[eucalyptus]] trees. In the desert, the flora is very sparse and consists of [[grasses]] and thorn bushes. The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting, which has led to a conservation program on [[Sir Bani Yas]] Island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the 1970s, resulting in the survival of, for example, [[Arabian Oryx]], [[Arabian camel]] and [[leopard]]s. [[Coastal fish]] and [[mammals]] consist mainly of [[mackerel]], [[Estuary perch|perch]], and [[tuna]], as well as [[shark]]s and whales.

===Climate===
The climate of the UAE is subtropical-arid with hot summers and warm winters. The climate is categorized as desert climate. The hottest months are July and August, when average maximum temperatures reach above {{convert|45|°C|°F|0}} on the [[coastal plain]].

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of the United Arab Emirates}}

The United Arab Emirates is a [[Federation|federal]] [[constitutional monarchy]] made up from a federation of seven [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] tribal [[monarchy]]-styled political system called [[Sheikhdoms]]. It is governed by a [[Federal Supreme Council]] made up of the ruling Sheikhs of [[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Abu Dhabi]], [[Emirate of Ajman|Ajman]], [[Emirate of Fujairah|Fujairah]], [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]], [[Emirate of Dubai|Dubai]], [[Ras al-Khaimah]] and [[Umm al-Quwain]]. All responsibilities not granted to the national government are reserved to the individual emirate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/government/political_system.asp#B|title=UAE Government: Political system|work=UAEinteract|access-date=12 February 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213062650/http://www.uaeinteract.com/government/political_system.asp#B|archivedate=13 February 2016}}</ref> A percentage of revenues from each emirate is allocated to the UAE's central budget.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/government/political_system.asp |title=UAE Government: Political system |work=UAEinteract |access-date=12 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213062650/http://www.uaeinteract.com/government/political_system.asp |archivedate=13 February 2016  }}</ref> The United Arab Emirates uses the title [[Sheikh]] instead of [[Emir]] to refer to the rulers of individual emirates. The title is used due to the sheikhdom styled governing system in adherence to the culture of [[tribes of Arabia]], where Sheikh means leader, elder, or the tribal chief of the clan who partakes in shared decision making with his followers.

The [[President of the United Arab Emirates|President]] and [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Arab Emirates|Prime Minister]] are elected by the Federal Supreme Council. Usually, a sheikh from Abu Dhabi holds the presidency and a sheikh from Dubai the prime minister-ship. All prime ministers but one have served concurrently as vice president. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan is the UAE founding father and widely accredited for unifying the seven emirates into one country. He was the UAE's first president from the nation's founding until his death on 2 November 2004. On the following day the Federal Supreme Council elected his son, [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], to the post.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabruleoflaw.org/countryprofiles/uae.html|title=UAE|publisher=Arabruleoflaw.org|access-date=12 February 2016}}</ref>

The federal government is composed of three branches:
* [[Legislature|Legislative]]: A [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Federal Supreme Council]] and the [[advisory board|advisory]] [[Federal National Council]] (FNC).
* [[Executive (government)|Executive]]: The [[President of UAE|President]], who is also [[commander-in-chief]] of the military, the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Arab Emirates|Prime Minister]] and the [[Cabinet of the United Arab Emirates|Council of Ministers]].
* [[Judiciary|Judicial]]: The [[Federal Supreme Court of the United Arab Emirates|Supreme Court]] and lower federal courts.

The UAE legislative is the [[Federal National Council]] which convenes nationwide elections every 4 years. The FNC consists of 40 members drawn from all the emirates. Each emirate is allocated specific seats to ensure full representation. Half are appointed by the rulers of the constituent emirates, and the other half are elected. By law, the council members have to be equally divided between males and females. The FNC is restricted to a largely [[:wikt:consultation|consultative]] role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/the-federal-national-council-|title=The Federal National Council|publisher=U.AE|date=3 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.government.ae/gov/en/gov/federal/politics.jsp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027123241/http://www.government.ae/gov/en/gov/federal/politics.jsp |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 October 2005 |title=UAE Federal e-Government Portal |publisher=Government.ae |df= }}</ref><ref>[https://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/sheikh-khalifa-uae-s-federal-national-council-to-be-50-per-cent-women-1.800357 Sheikh Khalifa: UAE's Federal National Council to be 50 per cent women] The National, 8 December 2018</ref>

Sheikh Zayed was asked by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in April 1997 on why there is no elected [[democracy]] in the United Arab Emirates, in which he replied:
<blockquote>Why should we abandon a system that satisfies our people, in order to introduce a system that seems to engender [[dissent]] and confrontation? Our system of government is based upon our religion and that is what our people want. Should they seek alternatives, we are ready to listen to them.
We have always said that our people should voice their demands openly. We are all in the same boat, and they are both the captain and the crew. Our doors are open for any opinion to be expressed, and this is well known by all our citizens. It is our deep conviction that God has created people free, and has prescribed that each individual must enjoy [[freedom of choice]]. No one should act as if they own others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aiu.edu/applications/DocumentLibraryManager/upload/SAED%20FT.pdf|title=Zayed as a Role Model of Leadership|first=Saed|last=Alshanti|date=2008|page=49|publisher=Atlantic International University}}</ref></blockquote>

The UAE has extensive diplomatic and commercial relations with other countries. It plays a significant role in [[OPEC]] and the UN, and is one of the founding members of the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC). One of the main anchorers of the UAE's foreign policy has been building cooperation-based relations with all countries of the world. Substantial development assistance has increased the UAE's stature among recipient states. Most of this foreign aid (in excess of $15 billion) has been to Arab and Muslim countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

The UAE is a member of the [[United Nations]] and several of its specialized agencies ([[ICAO]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[UPU]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[WIPO]]),  as well as the [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Arab League]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC), OPEC, [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries]], and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

The United Arab Emirates military force was formed in 1971 from the historical [[Trucial Oman Scouts]], a long symbol of public order in [[Eastern Arabia]] and commanded by British officers. The Trucial Oman Scouts were turned over to the United Arab Emirates, as the nucleus of its defence forces in 1971, with the formation of the UAE, and was absorbed into the Union Defence Force.

Although initially small in number, the UAE armed forces have grown significantly over the years and are presently equipped with some of the most modern weapon systems, purchased from a variety of western military advanced countries, mainly France, the US and the UK. Most officers are graduates of the United Kingdom's [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military Academy]] at [[Sandhurst, Berkshire|Sandhurst]], with others having attended the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in Australia, and [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|St Cyr]], the military academy of France. France and the United States have played the most strategically significant roles with defence cooperation agreements and military material provision.<ref>{{cite news|title=UAE confirms discussions with France on purchase of Rafale aircraft|url=http://www.wam.org.ae/servlet/Satellite?c=WamLocEnews&cid=1200074664706&p=1135099400124&pagename=WAM%2FWamLocEnews%2FW-T-LEN-FullNews|agency=Emirates News Agency|date=5 June 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509014605/http://www.wam.org.ae/servlet/Satellite?c=WamLocEnews&cid=1200074664706&p=1135099400124&pagename=WAM%2FWamLocEnews%2FW-T-LEN-FullNews|archivedate=9 May 2013}}</ref>

Some of the UAE military deployments include an infantry battalion to the United Nations [[UNOSOM II]] force in [[Somalia]] in 1993, the 35th Mechanised Infantry Battalion to [[Kosovo]], a regiment to Kuwait during the [[Iraq War]], [[demining]] operations in [[Lebanon]], [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in [[Afghanistan]], [[2011 military intervention in Libya|American-led intervention in Libya]], [[American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War|American-led intervention in Syria]], and the [[Saudi-led intervention in Yemen]].

The United Arab Emirates comprises seven emirates. [[Dubai]] is the most populous emirate with 35.6% of the UAE population. The [[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Emirate of Abu Dhabi]] has 31.2%, meaning that over two-thirds of the UAE population lives in either Abu Dhabi or Dubai.

Abu Dhabi has an area of {{convert|67340|km2|0|abbr=off}}, which is 86.7% of the country's total area, excluding the islands. It has a coastline extending for more than {{convert|400|km|-1|abbr=on}} and is divided for administrative purposes into three major regions.
The Emirate of Dubai extends along the Persian Gulf coast of the UAE for approximately {{convert|72|km|0|abbr=on}}. Dubai has an area of {{convert|3885|km2|0|abbr=off}}, which is equivalent to 5% of the country's total area, excluding the islands. The Emirate of Sharjah extends along approximately {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=on}} of the UAE's Persian Gulf coastline and for more than {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} into the interior. The northern emirates which include Fujairah, Ajman, Ras al-Khaimah, and [[Umm al-Quwain|Umm al-Qaiwain]] all have a total area of {{convert|3881|km2|0|abbr=off}}. There are two areas under joint control. One is jointly controlled by Oman and Ajman, the other by Fujairah and Sharjah.

There is an Omani [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] surrounded by UAE territory, known as [[Madha|Wadi Madha]]. It is located halfway between the [[Musandam Governorate|Musandam]] peninsula and the rest of Oman in the Emirate of [[Sharjah]]. It covers approximately {{convert|75|km2|0|abbr=off}} and the boundary was settled in 1969. The north-east corner of Madha is closest to the Khor Fakkan-Fujairah road, barely {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=off}} away. Within the Omani exclave of Madha, is a UAE exclave called [[Nahwa]], also belonging to the Emirate of Sharjah. It is about {{convert|8|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} on a dirt track west of the town of New Madha. It consists of about forty houses with its own clinic and telephone exchange.

The UAE has a federal court system. There are three main branches within the court structure: civil, criminal and [[Sharia law]]. The UAE's judicial system is derived from the [[civil law system]] and Sharia law. The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts. UAE's criminal and civil courts apply elements of Sharia law, codified into its criminal code and family law.

The UAE has developed from a juxtaposition of Bedouin tribes to one of the world's most wealthy states in only about 50 years. Economic growth has been impressive and steady throughout the history of this young confederation of emirates with brief periods of recessions only, e.g. in the global financial and economic crisis years 2008–09, and a couple of more mixed years starting in 2015 and persisting until 2019. Between 2000 and 2018, average real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth was at close to 4%.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.empyrean-advisors.com/united-arab-emirates-country-analysis/|title=United Arab Emirates – Economic, Social, and Institutional Analysis – Empyrean Advisors|website=www.empyrean-advisors.com|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> It is the second largest economy in the GCC (after Saudi Arabia),<ref name="Economy2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?section=editorschoice&xfile=/data/editorschoice/2013/December/editorschoice_December12.xml |title=UAE's economy growth momentum set to pick up |work=[[Khaleej Times]] |date=27 December 2013 |access-date=5 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104225058/http://khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?xfile=%2Fdata%2Feditorschoice%2F2013%2FDecember%2Feditorschoice_December12.xml&section=editorschoice |archivedate=4 January 2014 |df= }}</ref> with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of US$414.2 billion, and a real GDP of 392.8 billion constant 2010 USD in 2018.<ref name=":2" /> Since its independence in 1971, the UAE's economy has grown by nearly 231 times to 1.45 trillion AED in 2013. The non-oil trade has grown to 1.2 trillion AED, a growth by around 28 times from 1981 to 2012.<ref name="Economy2013"/> Backed by the world's seventh-largest oil deposits, and thanks to considerate investments combined with decided economic liberalism and firm Government control, the UAE has seen their real GDP more than triple in the last four decades. Nowadays the UAE is one of the world's richest countries, with GDP per capita almost 80% higher than OECD average.<ref name=":2" />

As impressive as economic growth has been in the UAE, the total population has increased from just around 550,000 in 1975 to close to 10 million in 2018. This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the Government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the Government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies – where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.<ref name=":2" />

Between 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.<ref name=":2" />

===Business and finance===
[[File:Abu dhabi skylines 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Abu Dhabi skyline]]
The UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented Government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure. Moreover, the country has made continuous and convincing improvements to its regulatory environment and is generally a top country for doing business.<ref name=":2" /> UAE is ranked as the 26th best nation in the world for doing business by the [[Doing Business Report|Doing Business 2017 Report]] published by the [[World Bank Group]].<ref name="Doing Business">{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings|title=Ranking of Economies|work=[[World Bank Group]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005151/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/06/12/afx3810988.html|archivedate=4 June 2011}}</ref> The UAE are in the top ranks of several global indices, such as the Doing Business, the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), the World Happiness Report (WHR) and the Global Innovation Index (GII). The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), for example, assigns the UAE rank two regionally in terms of business environment and 22 worldwide. From the 2018 Arab Youth Survey the UAE emerges as top Arab country in areas such as living, safety and security, economic opportunities, and starting a business, and as an example for other states to emulate.<ref name=":2" />

The weaker points remain the level of education across the UAE population, limitations in the financial and labour markets, barriers to trade and some regulations that hinder business dynamism. The major challenge for the country, though, remains translating investments and strong enabling conditions into knowledge, innovation and creative outputs.<ref name=":2" />

UAE law does not allow trade unions to exist.<ref name="ituc" /> The right to [[collective bargaining]] and the [[right to strike]] are not recognised, and the [[Ministry of Labour]] has the power to force workers to go back to work. Migrant workers who participate in a strike can have their work permits cancelled and be deported.<ref name="ituc">{{cite web | url=http://survey.ituc-csi.org/United-Arab-Emirates.html?edition=336 | title=United Arab Emirates | work=ITUC }}</ref> Consequently, there are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with Emiratis – and other [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] Arabs – getting preference in public sector jobs despite lesser credentials than competitors and lower motivation. In fact, just over eighty percent of Emirati workers hold government posts, with many of the rest taking part in state-owned enterprises such as [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airlines]] and [[Dubai Properties]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Krane |first=Jim |title=City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism |place=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2009 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cityofgolddubaid0000kran/page/267 267–270] |isbn=978-0-312-53574-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/cityofgolddubaid0000kran/page/267 }}</ref>

The UAE's monetary policy is in the service of stability and predictability, as the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) keeps a peg to the US Dollar (USD) and moves interest rates close to the Federal Funds Rate. This policy makes sense in the current situation of global and regional economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Also considering the fact that exports have become the main driver of the UAE's economic growth (the contribution of international trade to GDP grew from 31% in 2017 to 33.5% in 2018, outpacing overall GDP growth for the period), and the fact that the AED is currently undervalued, a departure from this policy – and particularly the peg – would negatively affect this important part of the UAE economy in the short term. In the mid- to long term, however, the peg will become less important, as the UAE transitions to a knowledge-based economy – and becomes yet more independent from the oil and gas sector (oil is currently still being traded not in AED, but in USD). On the contrary, it will become more and more important for the Government to have monetary policy at its free disposal to target inflation, shun too heavy reliance on taxes, and avoid situations where decisions on exchange rates and interest rates contradict fiscal policy measures – as has been the case in recent years, where monetary policy has limited fiscal policy effects on economic expansion.<ref name=":2" />

According to [[Fitch Ratings]], the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 – which the UAE currency complies to – have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d537bae-cf30-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6|title= UAE banks prepare for rough ride ahead|access-date=18 October 2019|website=Financial Times}}</ref>

Since 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018 growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy the Government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 18. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the Government's expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.<ref name=":2" />

In July 2020, a [[UAE]]-based firm, Essentra FZE agreed to pay a fine of $665,112 to the [[US Department of Justice]].

===Oil and gas===
The UAE leadership has driven forward economic diversification efforts already before the oil price crash in the 1980s, and the UAE is nowadays the most diversified economy in the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. Although the oil and gas sector does still play an important role in the UAE economy, these efforts have paid off in terms of great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The introduction of the [[Value-added tax|VAT]] has provided the Government with an additional source of income – approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion [[United Arab Emirates dirham|United Arab Emirates Dirham]] (AED) – affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total Government revenue. While the Government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.<ref name=":2" />

===Tourism===

Tourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy. [[Dubai]] is the top tourism destination in the Middle East.<ref name="tdb" /> According to the annual MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index, Dubai is the fifth most popular tourism destination in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfbusiness.com/2014/07/dubai-ranks-fifth-among-top-global-destinations-travellers/|title=Dubai Ranks Fifth Among Top Global Destinations For Travellers|work=Gulf Business|date=10 July 2014}}</ref> Dubai holds up to 66% share of the UAE's tourism economy, with [[Abu Dhabi]] having 16% and [[Sharjah]] 10%.

In February 2008, the Ministry of Health unveiled a five-year health strategy for the public health sector in the northern emirates, which fall under its purview and which, unlike Abu Dhabi and Dubai, do not have separate healthcare authorities. The strategy focuses on unifying healthcare policy and improving access to healthcare services at reasonable cost, at the same time reducing dependence on overseas treatment. The ministry plans to add three hospitals to the current 14, and 29 primary healthcare centres to the current 86. Nine were scheduled to open in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uae.gov.ae/Government/health.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612101330/http://www.uae.gov.ae/Government/health.htm|archivedate=12 June 2008 |title=UAE Health |publisher=Uae.gov.ae }}</ref>

The introduction of mandatory [[health insurance]] in Abu Dhabi for [[expatriate]]s and their dependants was a major driver in reform of healthcare policy. Abu Dhabi nationals were brought under the scheme from 1 June 2008 and Dubai followed for its government employees. Eventually, under federal law, every Emirati and expatriate in the country will be covered by compulsory health insurance under a unified mandatory scheme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/health/health-cover-is-mandatory-1.43089 |author=El Shammaa, Dina |title=Health cover is mandatory |work=Gulf News |date=3 January 2009 |access-date=1 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112123918/http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/health/health-cover-is-mandatory-1.43089 |archive-date=12 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
