'''Operation London Bridge'''  has been a codename that referred to the plan for what will happen in the days after the death of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realms]]. The plan was originally devised in the 1960s and is updated several times each year. It involves planning from government departments, the [[Church of England]], [[Metropolitan Police Service]], the [[British Armed Forces]], the media, [[the Royal Parks]], [[London boroughs]], the [[Greater London Authority]] and [[Transport for London]]. Some critical decisions relating to the plan were made by the Queen herself, although some can only be made by her successor (the current heir apparent is her son, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]), after her death.

As of early 2017, the phrase "[[London Bridge]] is down" was expected to be used to communicate the death of the Queen to the [[prime minister of the United Kingdom]] and key personnel, setting the plan into motion.

The codename Operation London Bridge primarily refers to events that would take place in the United Kingdom. In addition to the United Kingdom, other [[Commonwealth realm]]s where Elizabeth II acts as monarch have developed their own plans for what will happen in the days after her death. These corresponding plans would run concurrently with Operation London Bridge.

==Background==
Funerals and coronations for the Royal Household are typically organised by the [[Earl Marshal]] and the officers in the [[College of Arms|College of Heralds]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=College of Arms|website=college-of-arms.gov.uk|accessdate=12 November 2019|year=2019}}</ref> Pre-determined phrases have typically been used as "codenames" for plans relating to the death and funeral of a royal family member. Initially, codenames were used by key officials in an effort to prevent [[Buckingham Palace]] switchboard operators from learning of the death prior to a public announcement.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/16/what-happens-when-queen-elizabeth-dies-london-bridge|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Operation London Bridge: the secret plan for the days after the Queen’s death|date=16 March 2017|accessdate=17 March 2017|first=Sam|last=Knight}}</ref><ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/operation-london-bridge-queen-dead-elizabeth-ii-secret-plan-buckingham-palace-a7632891.html|first=Maya|last=Oppenheim|title=This is the secret code word when the Queen dies|work=The Independent|date=16 March 2017}}</ref> When [[George VI|King George VI]] died in 1952, key government officials were informed with the phrase "Hyde Park Corner".<ref name="theguardian.com"/> 

Several codenamed funeral plans for royal family members in the late-20th and early 21st century have used the names of prominent bridges in the United Kingdom. Operation Tay Bridge was the phrase used for the death and funeral plans of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], and was rehearsed for 22 years before its eventual use in 2002.<ref name=Guard/> The [[funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|funeral plan for Diana, Princess of Wales]], was also modelled after Operation Tay Bridge.<ref name="theguardian.com"/><ref name=Guard>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/apr/01/queenmother.monarchy1|title=A week of mourning for the last empress|work=The Guardian|date=1 April 2002}}</ref> As of early 2017, the phrase Operation [[Forth Bridge]] referred to funeral plans for [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]];<ref name="theguardian.com"/> Operation [[Menai Suspension Bridge|Menai Bridge]] referred to the funeral plan for [[Charles, Prince of Wales]];<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/155725|title=The Insider – Paul Routledge|work=New Statesman|date=17 June 2002}}</ref> and Operation London Bridge referred to the funeral plan for Queen [[Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/operation-london-bridge-what-happens-when-the-queen-dies_uk_58ca6f33e4b0ec9d29d8ed39|title=5 Things We've Learned About 'London Bridge' – The Queen's Death Protocol|date=16 March 2017|first=George|last=Bowden}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/03/16/theres-a-secret-code-word-for-when-the-queen-dies-6512708/|title=There's a secret code word for when the Queen dies|first=Toby|last=Meyjes|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=16 March 2017}}</ref>

The [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|Queen's private secretary]] will be the first official (i.e., not one of the Queen's relatives or part of a medical team) to convey the news. Their first act will be to contact the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], where [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|civil servants]] will convey the code phrase "London Bridge is down" to the prime minister using secure telephone lines.<ref name="theguardian.com"/> The [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]'s Global Response Centre, based at a secret location in [[London]], will communicate the news to the governments of the fifteen other countries of which the Queen was the head of state (the [[Commonwealth realm]]s), and to the governments of the other countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name="theguardian.com"/>

The media would be informed via an announcement to the [[PA Media|Press Association]] (now known as PA Media) and the British Broadcasting Corporation ([[BBC]]) through the Radio Alert Transmission System (RATS) and to commercial radio on the [[Independent Radio News]] through a network of blue "[[Independent Radio News#Obituary Procedure|obit lights]]" which will alert presenters to play "inoffensive music" and prepare for a news flash, while [[BBC Two]] would suspend scheduled programming and switch to [[BBC One]]'s broadcast of the announcement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gogarty |first1=Conor |title=Operation London Bridge: This is what will happen when the Queen dies |url=https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/operation-london-bridge-what-happen-1759578 |website=Gloucestershire Live |accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref> [[BBC News]] will air a pre-recorded sequence of portraits, during which the presenters on duty at the time will prepare for the formal announcement by putting on dark clothing prepared for this purpose. ''The Guardian'' has reported that ''The Times'' has eleven days of prepared coverage ready and that [[ITN]] and [[Sky News]] have long rehearsed her death, but substituting the name "Mrs Robinson".<ref name="theguardian.com"/>

The moment after the Queen's death, the heir to the throne would immediately become the monarch, and although not crowned, they would still be addressed as the new sovereign. While the new monarch may choose to adopt his first baptismal name as their [[regnal name]], they may also elect to chose a different regnal name; as any new monarch that comes to the throne has the right to choose their regnal name. In their first act as the new monarch, they will go on a [[tour]] of the [[United Kingdom]], including [[London]] and [[Belfast]]. 

A footman would pin a dark-edged notice to the gates of Buckingham Palace. At the same time, the palace website would display the same notice.<ref name="theguardian.com"/> The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] would be [[Recall of Parliament|recalled]]. If possible, it would meet within hours, and the prime minister would address the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. Local government buildings will fly flags at [[half-mast]] and [[Condolence book|books of condolence]] may be opened; ceremonial ornaments, such as [[ceremonial mace]]s or [[Livery collar#Mayoral collars|council chains]], are to be put in black purses.<ref>{{cite web |title=PROTOCOL FOR MARKING THE DEATH OF A  SENIOR NATIONAL FIGURE OPERATION LONDON BRIDGE |url=https://www.fremingtonparishcouncil.gov.uk/data/uploads/1449_755564376.pdf |website=Fremington Parish Council |accessdate=6 September 2020}}</ref>

The day after the Queen's death, the [[Accession Council]] would meet at [[St James's Palace]] to proclaim the new monarch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/privy-council/the-accession-council/|title=The Accession Council|website=Privy Council}}</ref><ref name="theguardian.com"/> Parliament would meet that evening when [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)#Parliamentarians|MPs would swear allegiance]] to the new monarch.

Different arrangements for moving the Queen's coffin are planned depending on where she dies. For example, if the Queen dies at [[Windsor Castle]] or [[Sandringham House]], it would be moved by car to Buckingham Palace within a couple of days. If the Queen dies overseas, it would be brought by [[No. 32 Squadron RAF|No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron]] to [[RAF Northolt]] and then by car to Buckingham Palace. If the Queen dies in [[Scotland]] (for example, at [[Holyrood Palace]] or [[Balmoral Castle]]), the coffin would first lie in repose at Holyrood Palace followed by a service of reception at [[St Giles' Cathedral]] in [[Edinburgh]]. Following this, the coffin would then be transported to [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Waverley Station]] and then taken by the [[British Royal Train|Royal Train]] to London. In all cases, the coffin would be taken to the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace. Four days after the Queen's death, it would be moved to [[Westminster Hall]] and [[Lying in state|lie in state]] for four days.

The state funeral would be held at [[Westminster Abbey]] nine days after the Queen's death, after which her body would be buried in a prepared tomb at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].<ref name="theguardian.com"/>
