'''''Morning Phase''''' is the twelfth official studio album and twelfth overall by American singer [[Beck]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beck-returns-to-sea-change-vibe-for-february-lp-morning-phase-20131028 |title=Beck Returns to 'Sea Change' Vibe for February LP 'Morning Phase' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Mike |last=Ayers |date=October 28, 2013}}</ref> The album was released in February 2014 by his new label, [[Capitol Records]]. According to a press release, ''Morning Phase'' is a "companion piece" to Beck's 2002 album ''[[Sea Change (album)|Sea Change]]''. Several of the musicians who recorded parts for ''Sea Change'' returned to record for ''Morning Phase''.

Upon release the album received critical acclaim and was nominated for five awards at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]], winning three: [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]]. Along with winning the award, [[Chris Martin]] collaborated with Beck to sing "Heart Is a Drum" at the Grammys.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Couch|first1=Aaron|title=Beck With Chris Martin Grammys Video Parformance (2015) - Hollywood Performance|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/beck-chris-martin-grammys-video-771305|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>

The roots of the album are similar to ''Sea Change'', as well as 1993's ''[[Golden Feelings]]''  and 1994's ''[[One Foot in the Grave (album)|One Foot in the Grave]]''. Most of the critics noted the change in sound from several previous recordings, and the genre being the same as ''Sea Change''.<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|title=Grammys: Beck's 'Morning Phase' wins Album of the Year |url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/showbiz/article/grammys-becks-morning-phase-wins-album-of-the-year|work=Malay Mail|accessdate=7 March 2015|date=9 February 2015}}</ref>

==Background==
Beck's previous album, ''[[Modern Guilt]]'', was released in 2008, and was the final album released under his [[Interscope Records]] contract.<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite web|last=Fricke |first=David |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/becks-long-road-to-morning-phase-20131121 |title=Beck Shares 'Morning Phase' Details |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=November 21, 2013 |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref> In the interim between album releases, Beck worked on a [[Beck Hansen#Modern Guilt, Song Reader and independent production work (2008–2012)|wide variety of projects]], including new studio material, most of which went unreleased for several years.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> In October 2012, bassist and frequent collaborator [[Justin Meldal-Johnsen]] commented: "I would estimate that there are currently about three or four albums’ worth of material floating around," and Beck himself said that "I wasn't sure if I was going to put out a record – or if I ''should'' put out a record. It felt like I was standing still, while everything else was in such flux."<ref name="Rolling Stone"/>

In 2012 and 2013, Beck began to perform live with more regularity than in the years immediately following the ''Modern Guilt'' tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/search?query=beck&year=2013&artist=63d6a2eb |title=Search for setlists: beck |publisher=setlist.fm |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref> This period also saw new original material. The "I Just Started Hating Some People Today/Blue Randy" single was released in 2012, and he self-released the "Defriended", "I Won't Be Long", and "Gimme" singles in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Beck#s=year_desc&p=1&t=Releases_Singles-EPs&q= |title=Beck Discography at Discogs |publisher=[[discogs]] |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref> All three of these songs were standalone releases as 12-inch singles on his own FONOGRAF label.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> "I Won't Be Long" and "Gimme" were allegedly from an unfinished project from 2009, described as being similar to ''[[Odelay]]''.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> According to Beck, the remaining songs from this project may see a similar release method.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/>

In June 2013, Beck announced the expected release of two new albums for 2014, with one of the two being an "acoustic" album. The press release for the "acoustic" album (along with the news of his contract with [[Capitol Records]]) arrived in October 2013, announcing the title as ''Morning Phase'' and giving a February 2014 release window.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/52801-beck-announces-new-album-morning-phase-signs-to-capitol-records/ |title=Beck Announces New Album Morning Phase, Signs to Capitol Records |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=October 28, 2013 |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref> The other still-unfinished album would be planned for a later release. In comparing the production of ''Morning Phase'' with his previous album, Beck stated that prior to recording ''Modern Guilt'' in 2008, he had suffered a serious spinal injury,<ref name="exclaim1">{{cite web|last=Hudson |first=Alex |url=http://exclaim.ca/News/beck_opens_up_about_severe_spine_injury |title=Beck Opens Up About Severe Spine Injury |work=Exclaim! |date=November 14, 2013 |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beck-details-spinal-injury-that-nearly-ended-his-touring-career-20140314 |title=Beck Details Spinal Injury That Nearly Ended His Touring Career |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=March 14, 2014}}</ref> and that the recording process for ''Modern Guilt'' was like "doing it with both hands tied behind your back. It hurt to sing. I'm whispering through half of those vocals."<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> On the other hand, Beck said that ''Morning Phase'' was a much more satisfying experience: "Some of the songs on the new record – I get to shout and yell. I'm like, 'Thank you!' I had a lot of ideas and things I'd been wanting to do. This last year and a half, I feel like I can really do them."<ref name="Rolling Stone"/>

==Recording==
In 2005, Beck began recording material in Nashville for a new album, but it remained incomplete for several years.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> It was not until 2012 that he returned to continue the project, this time recording at [[Third Man Records]] (which, incidentally had not existed at the time of his previous sessions).<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> Two songs from these new sessions, "I Just Started Hating Some People Today" and "Blue Randy" were released that year as a non-album single on Third Man's Blue Series.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> Other songs, like "Blackbird Chain", "Country Down", and "[[Waking Light]]" were reserved for what would become ''Morning Phase''.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> In the beginning of 2013, he recorded a great deal of the album in his hometown of Los Angeles in three days, with familiar studio and touring musicians Justin Meldal-Johnsen, [[Joey Waronker]], [[Roger Joseph Manning, Jr.]], and [[Smokey Hormel]]. The next six months, Beck worked with this material for an album release.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> His father [[David Campbell (composer)|David Campbell]] contributed orchestral arrangements for the album, as he had done previously for ''Sea Change'', and most of Beck's other albums.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/>

==Singles==
On January 20, 2014, the album's first single "[[Blue Moon (Beck song)|Blue Moon]]" was released.<ref name="Blue Moon Amazon">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Moon/dp/B00HYGKGU2/ |title=Blue Moon: Beck |date=January 20, 2014 |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}</ref> Beck released the second single from the album, "Waking Light", on February 4, 2014.<ref name="Waking Light Amazon">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Waking-Light/dp/B00I0C8PHA/ |title=Waking Light: Beck |date=February 4, 2014 |accessdate=February 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Minsker|first=Evan|title=Listen: Beck: "Waking Light"|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/53830-listen-beck-waking-light/ |work=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=February 4, 2014 |accessdate=February 4, 2014}}</ref> "[[Say Goodbye (Beck song)|Say Goodbye]]" was released as the third single in the United Kingdom on May 5, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/this-weeks-new-releases-05-05-2014-2983/ |title=This week's new releases 05-05-2014 |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=May 5, 2014 |accessdate=February 14, 2015 |author=Lane, Daniel}}</ref> "Heart Is a Drum" was released to United States [[adult album alternative]] radio on July 28, 2014, as the fourth single.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaccess.com/triple-a/future-releases |title=Future Releases on Triple A (AAA) Radio Stations, Independent Artist Song Releases |publisher=All Access Music Group |accessdate=February 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RAiJHdQu?url=http://www.allaccess.com/triple-a/future-releases |archivedate=July 19, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>
