Antonoff explained in 2014: "Half the time no one would show up or the equipment would be too fucked up to play ... but that's when I fell in love with touring." The band lasted until 2002.<ref name="Jada" /><ref name="JS2010" />

[[File:Bleachers 2014.jpg|thumb|Antonoff performing as Bleachers in 2014]]
Antonoff announced a solo project called [[Bleachers (band)|Bleachers]] in February 2014.<ref name="Roll">{{cite web|author1=Jon Blistein|title=Fun's Jack Antonoff Talks 'Over-the-Top' Solo Project Bleachers |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fun-s-jack-antonoff-talks-solo-project-bleachers-20140219 |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=January 11, 2015|date=February 19, 2014}}</ref> Antonoff explained in June 2014 that the project had been a consideration for around 10 years, and the name was inspired by the "disconnected, darker side" of suburban youth and [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] movies, which were "tied to a time when big songs were great songs." The songs for the debut Bleachers album were mostly written on Antonoff's laptop computer in hotel rooms during a Fun world tour.<ref name="Jada" />

{{quote|I wanted to bridge the gap between Disclosure and Arcade Fire—something both streamlined and organic ... The production and songwriting is extremely over-the-top, extremely epic and unapologetic. The record is all about finding a world where you can be kind to yourself in.<ref name="Roll" />}}

Antonoff explained to ''Rolling Stone'' that, while the song might sound joyous, "it's very desperate" and, like many of the other songs on the album is about loss.<ref name="Roll" /> Antonoff worked with producers John Hill and [[Vince Clarke]] on the Bleachers studio album, as he sought to create "massive, beautiful pop songs that sound fuckin' cool." The completed album, ''[[Strange Desire]]'', was released in July 2014, and "I Wanna Get Better" peaked at number one on the U.S. Alternative charts during the same week. In regard to ''Strange Desire'', Antonoff said:

{{quote|It doesn't have to be one or the other ... You don't have to [make] big pop songs that sound stupid and you don't have to make these fuckin' apologetic, tired droney songs that sound incredible. I really wanted both things to happen.<ref name="Roll" />}}

"I Wanna Get Better" was eventually named number 18 in ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 50 Best Songs of 2014, with the publication describing the song as "therapy rock" that is "as fun as it is cathartic".<ref>{{cite web|title=50 Best Songs of 2014|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/50-best-songs-of-2014-20141203/bleachers-i-wanna-get-better-20141202 |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=February 6, 2015|date=December 3, 2014}}</ref> Antonoff released Bleachers' second album ''[[Gone Now]]'' on June 2, 2017.

===Taylor Swift===
"[[Sweeter than Fiction]]", a song Antonoff co-wrote and co-produced with [[Taylor Swift]] for the film ''[[One Chance (film)|One Chance]]'' was released.

=== Shadow of the City ===
In 2015, Antonoff started his own music festival called Shadow of the City.<ref>{{cite web|last=Spanos |first=Brittany |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jack-antonoff-why-im-starting-a-new-jersey-music-festival-20150609 |title=Jack Antonoff: Why I'm Starting a New Jersey Music Festival |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 9, 2015 |accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref> The festival takes place annually at [[The Stone Pony]] Summer Stage in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]]. Shadow of the City is a one-day festival with only one stage, making it different from other music festivals. Money from each ticket sold is donated to The Ally Coalition, an organization founded by Antonoff and his sister Rachel. The 2018 and most recent lineup included Antonoff and his band Bleachers, Hayley Kiyoko, Julien Baker, Turnover, Beach Slang, Clams Casino, and Ex Reyes. Other past performers include Charli XCX, The 1975, Khalid, Carly Rae Jepsen, Bishop Briggs, BØRNS and more. In addition to musical performances, the festival conducts dunk tank and Mario Kart tournaments to benefit The Ally Coalition.

===Other projects===
Antonoff co-wrote the 2013 song "[[Brave (Sara Bareilles song)|Brave]]" with [[Sara Bareilles]] after the two were introduced by Sara Quin of the band [[Tegan and Sara]]. Bareilles said to Billboard: "We met for breakfast one day, and I was just so enamored with him and his personality ... The first day we sat down together was the day we wrote 'Brave.'" Antonoff wrote the song about a friend's struggle to speak openly about his sexuality.<ref name="Phu">{{cite news|author1=Hardeep Phull|title=How well do you know the Grammy nominees?|url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/23/how-well-do-you-know-your-grammy-nominees/|accessdate=January 11, 2015|work=New York Post|date=January 23, 2014}}</ref> The quickly written song was released on April 23, and by the end of June, "Brave" had sold 160,000 digital copies and peaked at number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

==Personal life==
When Antonoff first moved out of the family home near the end of 2012, he lived with his sister, Rachel, on the [[Upper West Side]] of New York City. Afterward, he relocated to [[Brooklyn Heights]] to live with [[Lena Dunham]], whom he was dating at the time.<ref name="Jada" /> As of December 2019, he resides in the Brooklyn Heights apartment he shared with Dunham, where he also owns a home-music studio.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Pelly|first1=Jenn|date=December 4, 2019|title=For today's confessional pop queens, Jack Antonoff is more than a producer: He's a confidant|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2019-12-04/jack-antonoff-grammys-lana-del-rey-taylor-swift|access-date=June 15, 2020|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

Antonoff and Dunham dated from April 2012 until December 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/lena-dunham-break-up-vogue-june-2018|title=Lena Dunham Explores Alone Time After a Break-Up|website=Vogue|language=en|access-date=December 30, 2018|date=May 11, 2018}}</ref> with representatives of both announcing their separation as "amicable".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jensen|first1=Erin|title=Lena Dunham, Jack Antonoff break up after spending more than five years together|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/09/lena-dunham-jack-antonoff-break-up-after-being-together-more-than-spenmoreding-than-five-yea/1015954001/|accessdate=January 9, 2018|work=[[USA Today]]|date=January 9, 2018}}</ref> Antonoff was once in a relationship with actress [[Scarlett Johansson]], his classmate at the [[Professional Children's School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/04/scarlett-johansson-jack-antonoff-prom|title=Scarlett Johansson Went to the Prom With Lena Dunham's Boyfriend|first=Richard|last=Lawson|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=April 7, 2014|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/lena-dunham-discovers-scarlett-johansson-dated-boyfriend-jack-antonoff-article-1.1699369|title=Lena Dunham discovers Scarlett Johansson once dated her boyfriend Jack Antonoff|website=[[New York Daily News]]|first=Zayda|last=Rivera|date=February 23, 2014|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref>

In June 2014, Antonoff said he was "desperate" for kids, explaining:

{{quote|It just seems like the most fun thing in the world. I've never met people who have kids who haven't looked me in the eye and been like, "It's the greatest thing that's ever happened."... I think it's biological. I'm 30. I'm not that young, right? I'm not, like, 24 or 22. I'm no longer in the phase of my life where I talk about everything as in the future. Like, I'm in the future.<ref name="Jada" />}}

Antonoff has spoken publicly about his struggles with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]] and [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]. He claims that hearing of others' battles with depression made him feel "not better, but not alone" and "way less scared."<ref>{{cite web|first=Emily Tess|last=Katz|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jack-antonoff-depression_n_7614786|title=Jack Antonoff Opens Up About Depression: 'It's Manageable If You Know You're Not Alone'|website=HuffPost|date=June 18, 2015|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref> As of June 2014, Antonoff was seeing both a therapist and a [[psychopharmacologist]], while also taking anti-anxiety medications. He has [[germophobia]] which was exacerbated by a bout of pneumonia that he suffered in 2011 while recording a studio album for his band Fun. His pulmonologist prescribed a daily run, but he explained that he hates it "more than anything" because it is "one of the most truly boring experiences on Earth."<ref name="Jada" />

Music is central to Antonoff's life and he explained in June 2014:

{{quote|I need a hobby, and I don't want it to be basketball ... I want it to be music. So to get away from music, I do other music. If I'm producing someone's song or writing with someone else, then doing a Bleachers song or a Fun song is an escape and it keeps me creative and it keeps me locked into what I want to do. If something's making me crazy, I need to go somewhere else and I don't want that thing to be yoga.<ref name="Jada" />}}
