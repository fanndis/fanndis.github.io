==History==

===As part of Our Ukraine Bloc===
The party is the continuation of the electoral alliance of the Viktor Yushchenko Bloc known as "Our Ukraine". The NSNU was formally launched on March 5, 2005 by the group of politicians appointed by the incumbent [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]], but it failed to attract most constituent parties that had been members of the previous bloc, which refused to be absorbed into the newly formed party.

The constituent congress, held in the capital [[Kyiv]] and attended by 6,000 delegates from all the [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|regions of Ukraine]], elected Yushchenko as honorary chairman (who received membership card No.1). Former deputy [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Roman Bezsmertnyi]] was elected head of the party's Presidium and [[Yuriy Yekhanurov]] as head of the party's Central Executive Committee.

During the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] on March 26, 2006, the party took part in the newly formed ''Our Ukraine'' bloc.<ref name=DATA/> In the snap [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] conducted on September 30, 2007, the party was part of the [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc]] alliance,<ref name=DATA/> that won 72 (14,15% of the national vote) out of 450 seats in the [[Verkhovna Rada]].<ref name=DATA/>

In December 2008, the [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]] (UNIAN) reported that the People's Union Our Ukraine and [[United Centre]] parties were to carry out a unifying congress on 17 January 2009. UNIAN also reported that the [[People's Democratic Party (Ukraine)|People's Democratic party]] may join the move.<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-291905.html Our Ukraine and United Center parties to unite] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222085840/http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-291905.html |date=February 22, 2012 }}, [[UNIAN]] (24 December 2008)</ref> However, neither of the events happened. In October 2008, the presidium of People’s Union Our Ukraine party had already decided not to team up with any other party for the proposed [[Next Ukrainian parliamentary election|snap parliamentary poll]] then the [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc]] and had called the idea of teaming up with United Centre "impossible".<ref>{{cite news|title=Our Ukraine officially refused to team up with United Center|url=http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-279800.html|work=[[UNIAN]]|date=21 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Our Ukraine Board defined the formatting of participation in elections|url=http://nuns.com.ua/news/5055/|work=Our Ukraine official website|date=21 October 2008|language=Ukrainian}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
