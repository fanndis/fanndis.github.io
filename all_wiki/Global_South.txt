[[File:North_South_divide.svg|upright=1.8|thumb|World map showing a traditional definition of the [[North–South divide in the World|North–South divide]] (red countries in this map are grouped as "Global South", blue countries as "Global North")]]

The '''Global South''' is an emerging term, used by the [[World Bank]] and other organizations, identifying countries with one side of the underlying global North–South divide, the other side being the countries of the [[developed country|Global North]].<ref name=":1" /> As such the term does not inherently refer to a geographical [[south]]; for example, most of the Global South is actually within the [[Northern Hemisphere]].<ref name=":1" />

The term was first introduced as a more open and value free alternative to "[[Third World]]"<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GYdeNdKrp8sC&pg=PA13 |title=Urban Poverty in the Global South: Scale and Nature |last=Mitlin |first=Diana |last2=Satterthwaite |first2=David |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415624664 |p=13}}</ref> and similar potentially "valuing" terms like [[developing country|developing countries]].

Countries of the Global South have been described as newly [[industrialisation|industrialized]] or in the process of industrializing, are largely considered by [[list of freedom indices|freedom indices]] to have lower-quality [[democracy|democracies]], and frequently have a history of [[colonialism]] by Northern, often [[Europe]]an states. The countries of [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Mexico]] have the largest [[population]]s and economies among Southern states.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Silver |first1=Caleb |title=The Top 20 Economies in the World |url=https://www.investopedia.com/insights/worlds-top-economies/ |website=Investopedia |publisher=DotDash |accessdate=17 July 2020}}</ref> The overwhelming majority of these countries are located in or near the [[tropics]].

The first use of this Global South in a contemporary political sense was in 1969 by [[Carl Oglesby]], writing in Catholic journal ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'' in a special issue on the [[Vietnam War]]. Oglesby argued that centuries of northern "dominance over the global south […] [has] converged […] to produce an intolerable social order."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Oglesby |first=Carl |year=1969 |title=Vietnamism has failed ... The revolution can only be mauled, not defeated |journal=Commonweal |volume=90}}</ref>

The term gained appeal throughout the second half of the 20th century, which rapidly accelerated in the early 21st century. It appeared in fewer than two dozen publications in 2004, but in hundreds of publications by 2013.<ref name="concept">{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/7917466 |title=The Use of the Concept 'Global South' in Social Science & Humanities |last1=Pagel |first1=Heikie |last2=Ranke |first2=Karen |date=11 July 2014|publisher=[[Humboldt University of Berlin]] |access-date=2016-10-06 |last3=Hempel |first3=Fabian |last4=Köhler |first4=Jonas}}</ref> The emergence of the new term meant looking at the troubled realities of its predecessors, i.e.: Third World or Developing World.

== Debates over the term ==
With its development, many scholars preferred using the Global South over its predecessors, such as "[[developing country|developing countries]]" and "[[Third World]]". Leigh Anne Duck, co-editor of [[Global South Development Magazine|''Global South'']], argued that the term is better suited at resisting "hegemonic forces that threaten the autonomy and development of these countries."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gssc.uni-koeln.de/node/451|title=Introduction: Concepts of the Global South {{!}} GSSC|date=2016-09-04|access-date=2019-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904205139/http://gssc.uni-koeln.de/node/451|archive-date=2016-09-04}}</ref> Alvaro Mendez, co-founder of the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]]'s Global South Unit, have applauded the empowering aspects of the term. In an article, ''Discussion on Global South,'' Mendez discusses emerging economies in nations like China, India and Brazil. It is predicted that by 2030, 80% of the world's [[middle-class]] population will be living in developing countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gssc.uni-koeln.de/node/469|title=Discussion on the Global South {{!}} GSSC|date=2016-10-26|access-date=2019-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026085516/http://gssc.uni-koeln.de/node/469|archive-date=2016-10-26}}</ref> The popularity of the term "marks a shift from a central focus on development and cultural difference" and recognizes the importance of geopolitical relations.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal |last1=Dados |first1=Nour |last2=Connell |first2=Raewyn |title=The Global South |journal=Contexts |date=February 2012 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=12–13 |doi=10.1177/1536504212436479 |jstor=41960738 |url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a86b/dacacf85e5c9046cbdd807192b4e6bdd3230.pdf }}</ref>

Critics of this usage often argue that it is a vague [[blanket term]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gssc.uni-koeln.de/node/454|title=What´s wrong with the Global North and the Global South?|last=Eriksen|first=Thomas Hylland|author-link=Thomas Hylland Eriksen|date=January 2015|publisher=Global South Studies Center|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161009141000/http://gssc.uni-koeln.de/node/454 |archive-date=2016-10-09|url-status=dead|access-date=2016-10-06}}</ref> Others have argued that the term, its usage, and its subsequent consequences mainly benefit those from the upper classes of countries within the Global South;<ref name=":1" /> who stand "to profit from the political and economic reality [of] expanding south-south relations."<ref name=":1" />

=== Scope ===

The geographical boundaries of the Global South remain a source of debate. Critics and scholars like Andrea Hollington, [[Oliver Tappin|Oliver Tappe]], Tijo Salverda and Tobias Schwarz agree that the term is not a "static concept."<ref name=":1" /> Others, like Rodolfo Magallanes, have argued against "grouping together a large variety of countries and regions into one category [because it] tends to obscure specific (historical) relationships between different countries and/or regions" and the power imbalances within these relationships.<ref name=":1" /> He argues that this "may obscure wealth differences within countries – and, therefore, similarities between the wealthy in the Global South and Global North, as well as the dire situation the poor may face all around the world."<ref name=":1" />

The term is not strictly geographical, and is not "an image of the world divided by the equator, separating richer countries from their poorer counterparts."<ref name=":1" /> Rather, geography should be more readily understood as economic and migratory, the world understood through the "wider context of globalization or global capitalism."<ref name=":1" />

== Uses of the term ==
''Global South'' "emerged in part to aid countries in the southern hemisphere to work in collaboration on political, economic, social, environmental, cultural, and technical issues."<ref name=":4">{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=Kevin |last2=Gills |first2=Barry K. |title=South–South cooperation and the rise of the Global South |journal=Third World Quarterly |date=2 April 2016 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=557–574 |doi=10.1080/01436597.2015.1128817 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=":9">{{cite journal |title=South-south cooperation |date=March 2013 |journal=Appropriate Technology |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=45-48 |id={{ProQuest|1326792037}} }}</ref> This is called [[South–South cooperation]] (SSC), a "political and economical term that refers to the long-term goal of pursuing world economic changes that mutually benefit countries in the Global South and lead to greater solidarity among the disadvantaged in the world system."<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":9" /> The hope is that countries within the Global South will "assist each other in social, political, and economical development, radically altering the world system to reflect their interests and not just the interests of the Global North in the process."<ref name=":4" /> It is guided by the principles of "respect for [[National Sovereignty|national sovereignty]], national ownership, independence, equality, non-conditionality, non-interference in [[Domestic policy|domestic affairs]], and mutual benefit."<ref name=":0a">{{cite web|url=http://ssc.undp.org/content/dam/ssc/documents/exhibition_triangular/SSCExPoster1.pdf|title=United Nations: Special Unit for South-South Cooperation|author=United Nations |publisher=United Nations Development Programme|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150919154320/http://ssc.undp.org/content/dam/ssc/documents/exhibition_triangular/SSCExPoster1.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-19|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=":0b">{{cite web|url=http://ssc.undp.org/content/ssc.html|title=United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation|author=United Nations |publisher=United Nations Development Programme|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121203031421/http://ssc.undp.org/content/ssc.html|archive-date=2012-12-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> Countries using this model of South–South cooperation see it as a "mutually beneficial relationship that spreads knowledge, skills, expertise and resources to address their development challenges such as high population pressure, poverty, hunger, disease, [[Environmental degradation|environmental deterioration]], conflict and [[natural disaster]]s."<ref name=":0a" /><ref name=":0b" /> These countries also work together to deal with "cross border issues such as environmental protection, [[HIV/AIDS]],"<ref name=":0a" /><ref name=":0b" /> and the movement of capital and labor.<ref name=":0a" /><ref name=":0b" />

Social psychiatrist [[Vincenzo Di Nicola]] has applied the Global South as a bridge between the critiques [[globalization]] and the gaps and limitations of the [[Global mental health|Global Mental Health]] Movement invoking [[Boaventura de Sousa Santos]]' notion of "epistemologies of the South" to create a new epistemology for [[social psychiatry]].<ref name=":6" />

== Associated theories ==
The term of the Global South has many researched theories associated with it. Since many of the countries that are considered to be a part of the Global South were first [[Colonization|colonized]] by Global North countries, they are at a disadvantage to become as quickly developed. [[Dependency theory|Dependency theorists]] suggest that information has a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] approach and first goes to the Global North before countries in the Global South receive it. Although many of these countries rely on political or economic help, this also opens up opportunity for information to develop Western bias and create an academic dependency.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ruvituso|first1=Clara I|date=January 2020|title=From the South to the North: The circulation of Latin American dependency theories in the Federal Republic of Germany|journal=Current Sociology|volume=68|issue=1|pages=22–40|doi=10.1177/0011392119885170|doi-access=free}}</ref> Meneleo Litonjua describes the reasoning behind distinctive problems of dependency theory as "the basic context of poverty and [[underdevelopment]] of Third World/Global South countries was not their traditionalism, but the dominance-dependence relationship between rich and poor, powerful and weak counties."<ref name=":5">{{cite journal|last1=Litonjua|first1=M.D.|date=2012|title=Third World/global South: From Modernization, to Dependency/liberation, to Postdevelopment|journal=Journal of Third World Studies|volume=29|issue=1|pages=25–56|doi=10.2307/45194852|jstor=45194852}}</ref>

What brought about much of the dependency, was the push to become modernized. After World War II, the U.S. made effort to assist developing countries financially in attempt to pull them out of poverty.<ref>{{Cite web|date=6 June 2014|title=America's Proud History of Post-War Aid – Foreign assistance after World War II proved critical to U.S. interests.|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2014/06/06/the-lessons-from-us-aid-after-world-war-ii|access-date=23 September 2020|website=US News}}</ref> [[Modernization theory]] "sought to remake the Global South in the image and likeliness of the First World/Global North."<ref name=":5" /> In other terms, "societies can be fast-tracked to modernization by 'importing' Western technical capital, forms of organization, and science and technology to developing countries."{{cite quote|date=August 2020}} With this ideology, as long as countries follow in Western ways, they can develop quicker.{{fact|date=August 2020}}

After modernization attempts took place, theorists started to question the effects through post-development perspectives. [[Postdevelopment theory|Post-Development]] theorists try to explain that not all developing countries need to be following Western ways but instead should create their own development plans. Felix Olatunji and Anthony Bature explain, “societies at the local level should be allowed to pursue their own development path as they perceive it without the influences of global capital and other modern choices, and thus a rejection of the entire paradigm from Eurocentric model and the advocation of new ways of thinking about the non-Western societies."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Olatunji|first1=Felix O.|last2=Bature|first2=Anthony I.|date=September 2019|title=The Inadequacy of Post-Development Theory to the Discourse of Development and Social Order in the Global South|journal=Social Evolution & History|volume=18|issue=2|doi=10.30884/seh/2019.02.12|doi-access=free}}</ref> The goals of post-development was to reject development rather than reform by choosing to embrace non-Western ways.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Matthews|first1=Sally J.|date=1 March 2010|title=Postdevelopment Theory|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of International Studies|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.013.39}}</ref>
