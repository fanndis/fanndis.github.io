'''Sinéad Marie Bernadette O'Connor''' (born 8 December 1966)<ref name=Allmusicbio /> is an Irish singer-songwriter who rose to fame in the late 1980s with her debut album ''[[The Lion and the Cobra]]''. O'Connor achieved worldwide success in 1990 with a new arrangement of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s song "[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]."

Since then, while maintaining her singing career, she has occasionally encountered controversy, partly due to her statements and gestures. These include her ordination as a priest, despite being a woman with a [[Roman Catholic]] background, and strongly expressing views on [[organised religion]], [[women's rights]], war, and [[child abuse]]. In addition to her ten solo albums, her work includes many singles, songs for films, collaborations with many other artists, and appearances at charity fundraising concerts.

In 2017, O'Connor changed her name to '''Magda Davitt'''. After converting to [[Islam]] in 2018, she changed it to '''Shuhada' Sadaqat'''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45987127|title=Sinéad O'Connor converts to Islam|date=26 October 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=26 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=Allmusicbio /><ref>{{cite web|url=

==Early life==
O'Connor was born in [[Glenageary]] in County Dublin and was named after [[Sinéad de Valera]], wife of Irish President [[Éamon de Valera]] and mother of the doctor presiding over the delivery, and [[Bernadette Soubirous|Saint Bernadette of Lourdes]].<ref name="sodifferent">Dermott Hayes, ''Sinéad O'Connor: So Different'', [[Omnibus Press]], 1991</ref> She is the third of five children, sister to novelist [[Joseph O'Connor|Joseph]], Eimear, John, and Eoin.

Her parents are Sean O'Connor, a [[structural engineer]] later turned [[barrister]] and chairperson of the Divorce Action Group, and Marie O'Connor. In 1979 O'Connor left her mother and went to live with her father and his new wife. At the age of 15, her shoplifting and truancy led to her being placed for eighteen months in a [[Magdalene Asylum]],<ref name=wp20100325>{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/25/AR2010032502363.html?hpid%3Dopinionsbox1%C3%A2%C2%8A%C2%82=AR | work=[[The Washington Post]] | title=To Sinead O'Connor, the pope's apology for sex abuse in Ireland seems hollow | date=28 March 2010}}</ref> the Grianán Training Centre run by the [[Order of Our Lady of Charity]]. In some ways, she thrived there, especially in the development of her writing and music, but she also chafed under the imposed conformity. Unruly students there were sometimes sent to sleep in the adjoining nursing home, an experience of which she later commented, "I have never—and probably will never—experience such panic and terror and agony over anything."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=McNeil |first=Legs |date=April 1990 |title=Sinead |url={{Google books |id=GJ2P1hu6nToC |page=54 |text=such panic and terror and agony |plainurl=yes}} |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]] |location=New York City |publisher=Camouflage Associates |access-date=2020-10-23}}</ref>

O'Connor in June 1993 wrote a public letter in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' which asked people to "stop hurting" her: "If only I can fight off the voices of my parents / and gather a sense of [[self-esteem]] / Then I'll be able to REALLY sing ..." The letter repeated accusations of abuse by her parents as a child which O'Connor had made in interviews. Her brother Joseph defended their father to the newspaper but agreed regarding their mother's "extreme and violent abuse, both emotional and physical". Sinead said that month, "Our family is very messed up. We can't communicate with each other. We are all in agony. I for one am in agony."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1993/Singer-and-Family-Rummage-Through-Their-Psyches-in-Public/id-75b63677eceede6a82d4d0d04262dfd3|title= Singer and Family Rummage Through Their Psyches in Public|agency=Associated Press|date=1 July 1993}}</ref>

==Musical career==

=== 1980s ===
One of the volunteers at Grianán was the sister of Paul Byrne, drummer for the band [[In Tua Nua]], who heard O'Connor singing "[[Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)|Evergreen]]" by [[Barbra Streisand]]. She recorded a song with them called "Take My Hand" but they felt that at 15, she was too young to join the band.<ref>''NME'', 29 October 1988</ref> Through an ad she placed in ''[[Hot Press (magazine)|Hot Press]]'' in mid-1984, she met [[Colm Farrelly]]. Together they recruited a few other members and formed a band called Ton Ton Macoute.<ref name="sodifferent" /> The band moved to [[Waterford]] briefly while O'Connor attended [[Newtown School, Waterford|Newtown School]], but she soon dropped out of school and followed them to Dublin, where their performances received positive reviews. Their sound was inspired by Farrelly's interest in [[world music]], though most observers thought O'Connor's singing and stage presence were the band's strongest features.<ref name="sodifferent" /><ref>Jimmy Guterman, ''Sinead: Her Life and Music'', [[Warner Books]], 1991</ref>

O'Connor's time as singer for Ton Ton Macoute brought her to the attention of the music industry, and she was eventually signed by [[Ensign Records]]. She also acquired an experienced manager, Fachtna O'Ceallaigh, former head of [[U2]]'s Mother Records. Soon after she was signed, she embarked on her first major assignment, providing the vocals for the song "Heroine", which she co-wrote with U2's guitarist [[The Edge]] for the [[Captive Soundtrack|soundtrack to the film ''Captive'']]. O'Ceallaigh, who had been fired by U2 for complaining about them in an interview, was outspoken with his views on music and politics, and O'Connor adopted the same habits; she defended the actions of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] and said U2's music was "bombastic".<ref name="Allmusicbio">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/sin%C3%A9ad-oconnor-mn0000756180|title=Sinéad O'Connor {{!}} Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=16 July 2019}}</ref> She later retracted her IRA comments saying they were based on nonsense, and that she was "too young to understand the tense situation in Northern Ireland properly".<ref name="contactmusic">{{cite magazine | title=Sinead O'Connor Takes Back Pro Ira Comments | url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/sinead-oconnor-takes-back-pro-ira-comments | magazine=Contactmusic.com | accessdate=13 February 2013 }}</ref>

Her first album ''[[The Lion and the Cobra]]'' was "a sensation" when it was released in 1987<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-lion-and-the-cobra-r14360 |title=The Lion and the Cobra |first=Stephen Thomas|last= Erlewine |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref> and it reached [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] status and earned a Best Female Rock Vocal Performance [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination. The single "[[Mandinka (song)|Mandinka]]" was a big college radio hit in the United States, and "I Want Your (Hands on Me)" received both [[college radio|college]] and urban play in a [[remix]]ed form that featured [[Rapping|rapper]] [[MC Lyte]]. In her first US network television appearance, O'Connor sang "Mandinka" on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite video

O'Connor named [[Bob Dylan]], [[David Bowie]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[The Pretenders]] as the artists who influenced her on her debut album.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gaisne Julien |title=Sinead O'Connor interview |journal=Rolling Stone (French Version) |issue=n°42, April 2012 |quote=Q: Qui étaient tes artistes préférés quand tu as commencé?

A:Bob Dylan, he probably still is. There were also David Bowie, Bob Marley, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Pretenders.''}}</ref>
In 1989 O'Connor joined [[The The]] frontman [[Matt Johnson (singer)|Matt Johnson]] as a guest vocalist on the band's album ''[[Mind Bomb]]'', which spawned the duet "Kingdom of Rain".

===1990s===
Her second album – 1990's ''[[I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got]]'' – gained considerable attention and mostly positive reviews: it was rated "second best album of the year" by the ''[[NME]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/bestalbumsandtracksoftheyear/1990 |title=album of the year |work=NME |accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref> She was praised for her voice and her original songs. She was also noted for her appearance: her trademark shaved head, often angry expression, and sometimes shapeless or unusual clothing.

The album ''I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got'' featured [[Marco Pirroni]] and [[Kevin Mooney]], of [[Adam and the Ants]] fame, and contained her international breakthrough hit "[[Nothing Compares 2 U#Sinéad O'Connor version|Nothing Compares 2 U]]", a song written by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and originally recorded and released by a side project of his, [[The Family (band)|The Family]].

[[The Bomb Squad|Hank Shocklee]], producer for [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], remixed the album's next single, "The Emperor's New Clothes", for a 12-inch that was coupled with the [[Celtic music|Celtic]] [[funk]] of "I Am Stretched on Your Grave". Pre-dating but included on ''I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got'' was also "Jump in the River", which originally appeared on the [[Married to the Mob (soundtrack)|''Married to the Mob'' soundtrack]]; the 12-inch version of the single had included a remix featuring performance artist [[Karen Finley]]. Also in 1990, O'Connor starred in a small independent Irish movie ''Hush-a-Bye Baby'' directed in [[Derry]] by [[Margo Harkin]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0102080}}</ref>

In 1990, she joined many other guests for former [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]]' [[The Wall Concert in Berlin|massive performance]] of ''[[The Wall]]'' in Berlin. (In 1996, she would guest on ''[[Broken China]]'', a solo album by [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] of Pink Floyd.) In 1991, her take on [[Elton John]]'s "[[Sacrifice (Elton John song)|Sacrifice]]" was acclaimed as one of the best efforts on the tribute album ''[[Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin]]''.

In 1990, she contributed a cover of "[[You Do Something to Me]]" to the [[Cole Porter]] tribute/AIDS fundraising album ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. ''Red Hot + Blue'' was followed by the release of ''[[Am I Not Your Girl?]]'', an album of [[Pop standards|standards]] and [[torch song]]s that she had listened to while growing up. The album received mixed-to-poor reviews, and was a commercial disappointment in light of the success of her previous work.

Also in 1990, she was criticized after she stated that she would not perform if the [[Star Spangled Banner|United States national anthem]] was played before one of her concerts. [[Frank Sinatra]] threatened to "kick her in the ass".<ref>{{cite news|title=Legislator Urges Boycott Over Sinead's Anthem Ban|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-28/entertainment/ca-409_1_national-anthem|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Times Wire Services|publisher=Times-Mirror Co.|page=10}}</ref> After receiving four [[Grammy Award]] nominations, she withdrew her name from consideration.<ref name=Allmusicbio/>

She spent the following months studying [[Bel canto]] singing with teacher Frank Merriman at the Parnell School of Music. In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' published 3 May 1993 she reported that her singing lessons with Merriman were the only therapy she was receiving, describing Merriman as "the most amazing teacher in the universe."<ref>{{Cite news

Also in 1992, she contributed backing vocals on the track "Come Talk To Me", and shared vocals on the single "Blood of Eden" from the studio album ''[[Us (Peter Gabriel album)|Us]]'' by [[Peter Gabriel]].

The 1993 soundtrack to the film ''[[In the Name of the Father (film)|In the Name of the Father]]'' featured "[[You Made Me the Thief of Your Heart]]", with significant contributions from [[U2]] frontman [[Bono]].

The more conventional ''[[Universal Mother]]'' (1994) did not succeed in restoring her mass appeal; however the music videos for the first and second singles, "[[Fire on Babylon]]" and "Famine", were nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video]].<ref name=Grammy1995>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-06/entertainment/ca-17089_1_vocal-performance/16|title=The 37th Grammy Nominations|page=16|date=6 January 1995|accessdate=15 April 2011|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref name=Grammy1996>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9601/grammy_noms/grammy_list.html |title=List of Grammy nominees |date=4 January 1996 |accessdate=18 June 2010 |publisher=CNN |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207073959/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9601/grammy_noms/grammy_list.html |archivedate=7 December 2012 }}</ref> She toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1995, but dropped out when she became pregnant. The ''[[Gospel Oak EP|Gospel Oak]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] followed in 1997, and featured songs based in an acoustic setting.

In 1994, she appeared in ''[[A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who]]'', also known as ''Daltrey Sings Townshend''. This was a two-night concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] produced by [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[The Who]] in celebration of his 50th birthday. A CD and a VHS video of the concert were issued in 1994, followed by a DVD in 1998.

She appeared in [[Neil Jordan]]'s ''[[The Butcher Boy (1997 film)|The Butcher Boy]]'' in 1997, playing the [[Virgin Mary]].<ref name=industry>{{cite web | last = Byrne | first = Paul | title = Neil Jordan (The Butcher Boy): The Provocative Son | publisher = industrycentral.net | date = 7 December 1999 | url = http://www.industrycentral.net/director_interviews/NJ01.HTM | accessdate = 30 August 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100721213638/http://www.industrycentral.net/director_interviews/NJ01.HTM | archive-date = 21 July 2010 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

In her documentary, ''Song of Hearts Desire'', she stated that her inspiration for the song was her friend, a lesbian who sang the song to lament the loss of her partner.

In 2003, she contributed a track to the [[Dolly Parton]] tribute album ''[[Just Because I'm a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton|Just Because I'm a Woman]]'', a cover of Parton's "Dagger Through the Heart". That same year, she also featured on three songs of [[Massive Attack]]'s album ''[[100th Window]]'' before releasing her double album, ''[[She Who Dwells in the Secret Place of the Most High Shall Abide Under the Shadow of the Almighty]]''. This compilation contained one disc of demos and previously unreleased tracks and one disc of a live concert recording.

Ultimately, after a brief period of inactivity and a bout with [[fibromyalgia]], her retirement proved to be short-lived. O'Connor stated in an interview with ''[[Harp (magazine)|Harp magazine]]'' that she had only intended to retire from making mainstream pop/rock music, and after dealing with her fibromyalgia she chose to move into other musical styles.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mills |first=Fred |url=http://harpmagazine.com/articles/detail.cfm?article_id=3538 |title=Sinead O'Connor: Saint Sinead |work=Harp magazine |date=November 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615030701/http://harpmagazine.com/articles/detail.cfm?article_id=3538 |archivedate=15 June 2008}}</ref> The [[reggae]] album ''[[Throw Down Your Arms]]'' appeared in late 2005.

===''Saturday Night Live'' performance===
[[File:Sinead rips into the Pope.jpg|thumb|right|O'Connor ripping a picture of [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1992]]
On 3 October 1992, O'Connor appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as a [[musical guest]]. She sang an [[a cappella]] version of [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[War (Bob Marley song)|War]]", which she intended as a protest against [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal|sexual abuse of children]] in the [[Catholic Church]], referring to child abuse rather than racism.<ref name="salon">{{Cite news|first=Jake |last=Tapper |url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/feature/2002/10/12/sinead/index_np.html |title=Sinéad was right |work=Arts & Entertainment |date=12 October 2002 |accessdate=24 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206041043/http://archive.salon.com/ent/feature/2002/10/12/sinead/index_np.html |archivedate=6 February 2007 }}</ref> She then presented a photo of [[Pope John Paul II]] to the camera while singing the word "[[evil]]", after which she tore the photo into pieces, said "Fight the real enemy", and threw the pieces towards the camera.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.notbored.org/sinead.html | title=Simulating Sinéad O'Connor— Sinéad O'Connor Rips It Up | volume = 33 | work =Not Bored! | issn = 1084-7340 | date=October 2001 | accessdate=24 October 2006}}</ref> The incident occurred nine years before [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] acknowledged the sexual abuse within the Church.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1671540.stm Pope sends first e-mail apology]; http://news.bbc.co.uk; 23 November 2001</ref>

''Saturday Night Live'' had no foreknowledge of O'Connor's plan; during the dress rehearsal, she held up a photo of a refugee child. [[NBC]] Vice-President of Late Night [[Rick Ludwin]] recalled that when he saw O'Connor's action, he "literally jumped out of [his] chair". ''SNL'' writer Paula Pell recalled personnel in the [[control booth (theater)|control booth]] discussing the cameras cutting away.{{r |snlbackstage20110220}} The audience was completely silent, with no booing or applause;{{r|hj19921006}} executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]] recalled that "the air went out the studio".

During his opening [[monologue]] the [[Saturday Night Live (season 18)#ep329|following week]], Catholic-raised host [[Joe Pesci]] held up the photo, explaining that he had taped it back together, to huge applause. Pesci also said that if it had been his show, "I would have gave her such a smack".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D6113DF931A25753C1A964958260 |title=CHRONICLE|work=The New York Times |date=12 October 1992 |accessdate=28 September 2011 |first=Nadine |last=Brozan}}</ref>

In a 2002 interview with ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', when asked if she would change anything about the ''SNL'' appearance, O'Connor replied, "Hell, no!"<ref>{{cite web|last=Tapper |first=Jake |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2002/10/12/sinead/index.html |title=Sin |work=Salon |date=12 October 2002 |accessdate=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607032923/http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2002/10/12/sinead/index.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 }}</ref>

====Madonna's reaction====
When Catholic-raised [[Madonna]] appeared [[Saturday Night Live (season 18)#ep337|later that season]] on ''SNL'', after singing "[[Bad Girl (Madonna song)|Bad Girl]]", she held up a photo of [[Joey Buttafuoco]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Hewitt |first=Bill |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20110255,00.html |title=Courting Trouble – Crime & Courts, Amy Fisher, Joey Buttafuoco |work=People |date=26 April 1993 |accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref> and, saying "fight the real enemy", tore it up. Madonna also roundly attacked O'Connor in the press for the incident, telling the ''[[Irish Times]]'': "I think there is a better way to present her ideas rather than ripping up an image that means a lot to other people." She added, "If she is against the Roman Catholic Church and she has a problem with them, I think she should talk about it."<ref name="Pareles">{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/01/arts/pop-view-why-sinead-o-connor-hit-a-nerve.html | work=The New York Times | title=POP VIEW; Why Sinead O'Connor Hit a Nerve | first=Jon | last=Pareles | date=1 November 1992}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' called it "professional jealousy" and wrote:

{{quote|After Madonna had herself gowned, harnessed, strapped down and fully stripped to promote her album ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' and her book ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]'', O'Connor stole the spotlight with one photograph of a fully clothed man. But the other vilification that descended on O'Connor showed she had struck a nerve.<ref name="Pareles" />}}

[[Bob Guccione, Jr.]] in a 1993 ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' editorial was adamant in his defence of O'Connor, writing:

{{quote|Madonna savaged her in the press, obviously to fuel publicity for ''Sex'' and sales of her new album, ''Erotica'' … But when the Sinead controversy threatened to siphon some of the attention from the impending release of ''Sex'', Madonna conveniently found religion again...<ref>{{cite web |last=Guccione, Jr. |first=Bob |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hcbFj_1xS7QC&q=bob+guccione+jr+spin+madonna+sex&pg=PA10 |title=Top Spin |work=Spin|date=January 1993 |accessdate=19 October 2010}}</ref>}}

In November 1991, a year prior to the incident, O'Connor had told ''Spin'' magazine:
{{quote|Madonna is probably the hugest role model for women in America. There's a woman who people look up to as being a woman who campaigns for women's rights. A woman who in an abusive way towards me, said that I look like I had a run in with a lawnmower and that I was about as sexy as a Venetian blind. Now there's the woman that America looks up to as being a campaigner for women, slagging off another woman for not being sexy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBDgkXRdUXYC&q=sexy+as+a+Venetian+blind+madonna&pg=PT52 |title=Special Child |work=Spin|date=November 1991 |accessdate=19 October 2010}}</ref>}}

===''After Dark'' appearance===
[[File:Sinéad O'Connor on After Dark 21 January 1995.JPG|right|thumb|Sinéad O'Connor on ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' on 21 January 1995]]
In January 1995, O'Connor made an [[After Dark (TV programme)#Sinéad O'Connor and "Ireland: Sex & Celibacy"|appearance]] on the British late-night television program ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' during an episode about [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases in Ireland|sexual abuse and the Catholic church in Ireland]].<ref>''The Evening Standard'', 25 January 1995</ref> The discussion included a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] and another representative of the Catholic church, along with former [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]]. Host [[Helena Kennedy]] described the event:

"While we were on the air, Sinéad O'Connor called in... Then I got a message in my earpiece to say she had just turned up at the studio.  Sinéad came on and argued that abuse in families was coded in by the church because it refused to accept the accounts of women and children".<ref>{{cite news |title= Baroness goes back to the twilight zone |newspaper=The Sunday Times |date=23 February 2003 |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article885791.ece}}</ref>

===Open letter to Miley Cyrus===
O'Connor published an open letter, on her own website, to American singer and actress [[Miley Cyrus]] on 2 October 2013 in which she warned Cyrus of the treatment of women in the music industry and the role that sexuality plays in this context, which was in response to Cyrus' music video for her song "[[Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)|Wrecking Ball]]". O'Connor stated:
{{quote |The message you keep sending is that its somehow cool to be prostituted… its so not cool Miley… its dangerous. Women are to be valued for so much more than their sexuality.  We aren't merely objects of desire.  I would be encouraging you to send healthier messages to your peers… that they and you are worth more than what is currently going on in your career.<ref>{{cite web|title=Open Letter to Miley Cyrus |url=http://www.sineadoconnor.com/2013/10/open-letter-to-miley-cyrus/ |work=Official Website |accessdate=5 October 2013 |first=Sinead |last=O'Connor |date=2 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232603/http://www.sineadoconnor.com/2013/10/open-letter-to-miley-cyrus/ |archivedate=4 October 2013 }}</ref>}}

Fellow musician [[Amanda Palmer]] responded with her own [[open letter]] that was published on Palmer's blog. After Palmer stated that O'Connor continues to be an important influence since her teenage years, Palmer then addressed where O'Connor was "off target" in her correspondence to Cyrus. Palmer explained that she wrote the letter en route to a benefit performance for the Girls Rock Dallas group that seeks to empower young female musicians in Dallas, US, and a subsequent video was published of a tribute [[cover version]] that she included in the performance, whereby she blends "Nothing Compares 2 U" with Cyrus’ song "[[Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)|Wrecking Ball]]".<ref>{{cite web | title = An open letter to Sinéad O'Connor, re: Miley Cyrus | url = http://amandapalmer.net/blog/20131003|work=Amanda Palmer & The Grand Theft Orchestra| accessdate=5 October 2013| first =Amanda | last = Palmer | date=3 October 2013}}</ref>

===Remarks about Prince===
Speaking about her relationship with [[Prince (singer)|Prince]] in an interview with [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] station [[NRK]] in November 2014 she said, "I did meet him a couple of times.  We didn't get on at all.  In fact we had a punch-up." She continued: "He summoned me to his house after '[[Nothing Compares 2U]]'. I made it without him.  I’d never met him.  He summoned me to his house – and it's foolish to do this to an Irish woman – he said he didn't like me saying bad words in interviews. So I told him to fuck off....He got quite violent.

===Tweets about non-Muslims===

After her conversion to Islam, O'Connor called those who were not Muslims "disgusting" and criticised Christian and Jewish theologians on Twitter in November 2018. She wrote: "What I'm about to say is something so racist I never thought my soul could ever feel it. But truly I never wanna spend time with white people again (if that's what non-muslims are called). Not for one moment, for any reason.

In March 2015, she announced that she was going to be a grandmother for the first time.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.evoke.ie/showbiz/nothing-compares-to-being-called-gran-sinead-o-connor-im-going-to-be-a-grandmother/| work= evoke.ie| title= Nothing compares to being called gran!

===Sexuality===
In a 2000 interview in ''[[Curve (magazine)|Curve]]'', O'Connor commented, "I'm a [[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]… although I haven't been very open about that and throughout most of my life I've gone out with blokes because I haven't necessarily been terribly comfortable about being a big lesbian mule. But I actually am a dyke."<ref>{{Cite news | publisher = Access my library | url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-27901349_ITM | title = Sinéad O'Connor Comes Out in an Exclusive Interview With Curve, the Nation's Best-Selling Lesbian Magazine | agency = PR Newswire | date = 8 June 2000 | accessdate =26 February 2008 }}</ref> However, soon after in an interview in ''[[The Independent]]'', she stated, "I believe it was overcompensating of me to declare myself a lesbian. It was not a publicity stunt. I was trying to make someone else feel better. And have subsequently caused pain for myself. I am not in a box of any description."  In a magazine article and in a programme on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] (''[[Ryan Confidential]]'', broadcast on RTÉ on 29 May 2003), she stated that while most of her sexual relationships had been with men, she has had three relationships with women.

===Health===
On a 4 October 2007 broadcast of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', O'Connor disclosed that she had been diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] four years earlier, and had attempted suicide on her 33rd birthday on 8 December 1999.<ref name="Toronto">Rayner, Ben. [https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/268921 "The gospel according to Sinead"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]''. 21 October 2007</ref> Then, on Winfrey's "Where Are They Now?" show of 9 February 2014, O'Connor said that she had received three "second opinions" and was told by all three that she was not bipolar.

In August 2015, she announced that she was to undergo a [[hysterectomy]] after suffering with gynaecological problems for over three years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.evoke.ie/showbiz/sinead-oconnor-message-to-grandkids-posted-on-facebook/| work=evoke.ie| title=Sinéad O'Connor's touching words for her grandkids ahead of hysterectomy| date=26 August 2015| access-date=27 August 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924040417/http://www.evoke.ie/showbiz/sinead-oconnor-message-to-grandkids-posted-on-facebook/| archive-date=24 September 2015| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> O'Connor would later blame the hospital's refusal to administer [[hormonal replacement therapy]] after the operation as the main reason for her mental health issues in the subsequent years, stating "I was flung into surgical menopause. Hormones were everywhere. I became very suicidal. I was a basket case."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Deerwester|first1=Jayme|title=Sinéad O'Connor tells Dr. Phil her problems stemmed from being 'flung into menopause'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/09/12/sinead-oconnor-tells-dr-phil-her-problems-stemmed-being-flung-into-menopause/659140001/|website=USA Today|accessdate=16 September 2017}}</ref>

Having smoked cannabis for 30 years, O'Connor went to a rehabilitation center in 2016, to end her addiction.<ref>https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7556690/sinead-oconnor-completes-30-day-rehab-stint-for-pot-addiction. ''Billboard''. Sinead O'Connor Completes 30-Day Rehab Stint For Pot Addiction, Moving Into Sober Living Facility. Gil Kaufman. 25 October 2016.</ref>

In August 2017, O'Connor posted a 12-minute video on her Facebook page in which she states that she has felt alone since losing custody of her 13-year-old son, for the past two years she has wanted to kill herself and only her doctor and psychiatrist were "keeping her alive".<ref>{{cite web|title=Sinead O'Connor sparks fears for her mental health after posting tearful video online|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/08/sinead-oconnor-sparks-fears-mental-health-posting-tearful-video/|date=August 2017}}</ref> The next month, O'Connor appeared on the American television talk show ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'' on the show's 16th season debut episode.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fernandez|first1=Matt|title=Sinead O'Connor on 'Dr. Phil': 'I'm Very Excited to Be Getting Some Proper Help'|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/sinead-oconnor-dr-phil-interview-video-1202555641/|website=Variety}}</ref> According to Dr. Phil, O'Connor wanted to do the interview because she wanted to "destigmatize mental illness," noting the prevalence of mental health issues among musicians.<ref>{{cite web|last1=France|first1=Lisa Respers|title=Sinead O'Connor sits down with 'Dr. Phil'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/08/entertainment/sinead-oconnor-dr-phil/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=16 September 2017}}</ref>

===Politics===
O'Connor is a vocal supporter of a [[united Ireland]], and called on the left-wing republican [[Sinn Féin]] party to be "braver". In December 2014 it was reported O'Connor had joined Sinn Féin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6451131/sinead-oconnor-sinn-fein-irish-republican-party-ireland-partition|title=Sinead O'Connor Won't Be Joining Irish Republican Party – Here's Why|website=Billboard}}</ref> O'Connor has called for the "demolition" of the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish Republic]] and its replacement with a new, united country. She has also called for key Sinn Féin politicians like [[Gerry Adams]] to step down because "they remind people of violence", referring to [[the Troubles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/sinead-oconnor-calls-for-demolition-of-the-irish-republic-and-the-birth-of-a-new-country-9922692.html|title=Why Sinead O'Connor wants to destroy Ireland and build a new country|website=The Independent}}</ref>

In a 2015 interview with the [[BBC]], O'Connor wished that Ireland had remained under British rule (which ended after the [[Irish War of Independence]], except for [[Northern Ireland]]), because the church took over the country instead.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/sinead-oconnor-i-wish-england-had-never-left-ireland-the-church-took-over-and-it-was-disastrous-31063731.html|title=Sinead O'Connor: 'I wish England had never left Ireland... the church took over and it was disastrous'|work=The Irish Independent}}</ref> Following the [[Brexit]] referendum in 2016, O'Connor wrote on Facebook "Ireland is officially no longer owned by Britain".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/sinead-oconnor-is-alive-and-celebrating-irelands-brexit-freedom/|title=Sinead O'Connor celebrates Ireland's Brexit 'freedom' in furious Facebook post|date=24 June 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}</ref>

===Religion===
In the late 1990s, Bishop [[Michael Cox (independent bishop)|Michael Cox]] of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church (an [[Independent Catholic churches|Independent Catholic]] group not in communion with the [[Catholic Church]]) [[Ordination of women|ordained]] O'Connor as a priest. The Roman Catholic Church considers [[Catholic Church doctrine on the ordination of women|ordination of women]] to be invalid and asserts that a person attempting the sacrament of ordination upon a woman incurs [[excommunication]].<ref name="O'Connor becomes a 'priest'">{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/328709.stm | title=O'Connor becomes a 'priest' | work = BBC News | date=4 May 1999 | accessdate=24 October 2006}}</ref> The bishop had contacted her to offer ordination following her appearance on the [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]’s ''Late Late Show,'' during which she told the presenter, [[Gay Byrne]], that had she not been a singer, she would have wished to have been a Catholic priest. After her ordination, she indicated that she wished to be called ''Mother Bernadette Mary''.<ref name="O'Connor becomes a 'priest'" />

In August 2018, via an [[open letter]], she asked [[Pope Francis]] to excommunicate her, as she had asked of Pope Benedict and John Paul II.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/26/sinead-oconnor-converts-to-islam-shuhada-davitt|title=Sinéad O'Connor converts to Islam, taking new name Shuhada' Davitt|first=Ben|last=Beaumont-Thomas|date=26 October 2018|website=The Guardian|accessdate=11 November 2018}}</ref>

In a July 2007 interview with ''[[Christianity Today]]'', O'Connor stated that she considers herself a Christian and that she believes in core Christian concepts about the [[Trinity]] and [[Jesus Christ]]. She said, "I think God saves everybody whether they want to be saved or not. So when we die, we’re all going home... I don't think God judges anybody. He loves everybody equally."<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/music/interviews/2007/sineadoconnor-0707.html | title = Jesus Is 'Like an Energy' | newspaper = Christianity Today | date = 7 September 2007 | accessdate = 19 October 2010}}</ref> In an October 2002 interview, she credited her Christian faith in giving her the strength to live through and overcome the effects of her child abuse.<ref name=salon />

On 26 March 2010, O'Connor appeared on ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'' to speak out about the [[Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland]].<ref>{{Cite news | date = 26 March 2010 |title= Sinéad O'Connor in TV | url= http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2010/03/26/ac.sinead.oconnor.intv.cnn?iref=allsearch | publisher = CNN | type= video}}</ref> On 28 March 2010, she had an opinion piece published in the Sunday edition of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in which she wrote about the scandal and her time in a [[Magdalene laundry]] as a teenager.{{r |wp20100325}} Writing for the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' she labelled the [[Holy See|Vatican]] as "a nest of devils" and called for the establishment of an "alternative church", opining that "Christ is being murdered by liars" in the Vatican.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/we-must-destroy-nest-of-devils-in-the-vatican-for-christs-sake-2823575.html | title = We must destroy nest of devils in the Vatican, for Christ's sake | newspaper = The Sunday Independent | date = 17 July 2011}}</ref> Shortly after the election of [[Pope Francis]] she described the office of the Pope as an "anti-Christian office."<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Yahoo | url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/45909111@N00/8561800343/in/set-72157632439786027/2013_03_150001_5h | contribution = The Office of Pope is anti-Christian | title = Flickr | date = 16 March 2013 | accessdate = 11 April 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> O'Connor stated:
{{quote |Well, you know, I guess I wish everyone the best, and I don't know anything about the man, so I’m not going to rush to judge him on one thing or another, but I would say he has a scientifically impossible task, because all religions, but certainly the Catholic Church, is really a house built on sand, and it's drowning in a sea of ''conditional'' love, and therefore it can't survive, and actually the office of Pope itself is an anti-Christian office, the idea that Christ needs a representative is laughable and blasphemous at the same time, therefore it is a house built on sand, and we need to rescue God from religion, all religions, they’ve become a smokescreen that distracts people from the fact that there ''is'' a holy spirit, and when you study the Gospels you see the Christ character came to tell us that we only need to talk directly to God, we never needed Religion…}}

Asked whether from her point of view, it is therefore irrelevant who is elected to be Pope, O'Connor replied,
{{quote |Genuinely I don't mean disrespect to Catholic people because I believe in Jesus Christ, I believe in the Holy Spirit, all of those, but I also believe in all of them, I don't think it cares if you call it Fred or Daisy, you know? Religion is a smokescreen, it has everybody talking to the wall. There ''is'' a Holy Spirit who can't intervene on our behalf unless we ask it. Religion has us talking to the wall. The Christ character tells us himself: you must only talk directly to the Father; you don’t need intermediaries. We all ''thought'' we did, and that's ok, we're not bad people, but let's wake up…  God was there before religion; it's there [today] despite religion; it'll be there when religion is gone.<ref>{{Citation | format = You tube | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB9F6YoyxJA |title= Sinead O'Connor's thoughts on the new Pope | newspaper = Channel 4 News | type = interview | first = Jon | last = Snow}}</ref>}}In October 2018, O'Connor converted to [[Islam]], calling it "the natural conclusion of any intelligent theologian's journey".<ref name=irishpostislam>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishpost.com/entertainment/sinead-oconnor-renounces-catholicism-converts-islam-161261|title=Sinead O'Connor renounces Catholicism and converts to Islam|last=Lonergan|first=Aidan|work=The Irish Post|access-date=25 October 2018}}</ref> The ceremony was conducted in Ireland by [[Sunni Islam]]ic theologian Shaykh [[Umar Al-Qadri]].
