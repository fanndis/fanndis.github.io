'''Jennifer Constance "Jenny" Lee Smith''' (born 2 December 1948) is an [[England|English]] golfer, known for winning the inaugural [[Women's British Open]] in 1976 and later winning the Order of Merit on the Women's Professional Golf Association tour (now [[Ladies European Tour]]) in 1981 and 1982.

Lee-Smith was born and raised in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and started playing golf at a relatively young age. After some success in regional tournaments in the late 1960s and early 1970s, she began to play in international tournaments.  She was a member of the Great Britain [[Curtis Cup]] team in both 1974 and 1976, represented England in the 1975 European Team Championships, and played for Great Britain & Ireland in the 1976 [[Espirito Santo Trophy]].<ref name="ladiesgolf">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ladiesgolf.co.uk/amateurrecords/pastamateursl.htm |title=Past Amateurs And Golfing Greats<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015121017/http://www.ladiesgolf.co.uk/amateurrecords/pastamateursl.htm |archive-date=2006-10-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1976, while still an amateur, Lee-Smith won the inaugural Ladies' British Open (now the [[Women's British Open]]).<ref>[http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/p/womensbritopen.htm Women's British Open - Info and History of Women's British Open Golf Tournament<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  There were only a handful of professional women golfers in the United Kingdom at the time, and the field was mostly made up of amateurs.  At the end of the year, she was voted Daks Woman Golfer of the Year along with Tegwen Perkins.<ref name="ladiesgolf"/>

Lee-Smith turned professional in 1977, and qualified for the [[LPGA Tour]] that year.  The Women's Professional Golf Association was formed in 1978, and Lee-Smith joined the tour for its first year in 1979.  She finished 8th on the money list that year, third in 1980, and won the [[Ladies European Tour#Order of Merit and seasonal award winners|Order of Merit]] as the leading money winner in both 1981 and 1982. She was voted the 1982 North East Sports Personality Of The Year.

Jenny now resides in [[Kent]], [[England]], with her family. She has three children (Katie, Josh, and Ben) and is married to Sam Lucas.
