On October 29, 2010, two packages, each containing a bomb consisting of {{convert|300|to(-)|400|g|oz}} of [[plastic explosive]]s and a detonating mechanism, were found on separate cargo planes. The bombs were discovered as a result of intelligence received from [[Saudi Arabia]]'s security chief. They were bound from [[Yemen]] to the United States, and were discovered at en route stop-overs, one at [[East Midlands Airport]] in the UK and one in [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]].

One week later, [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP) took responsibility for the plot, and for the crash of [[UPS Airlines Flight 6]].<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news | author=CNN Wire Staff | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/11/05/yemen.security.concern/?hpt=T2 | title=Yemen-based al Qaeda group claims responsibility for parcel bomb plot | publisher=CNN | date=November 5, 2010 | accessdate=November 5, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113054043/http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/11/05/yemen.security.concern/?hpt=T2 | archive-date=November 13, 2010 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> U.S. and British authorities believed [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] of AQAP was behind the bombing attempts, and that the bombs were most likely constructed by AQAP's main explosives expert, [[Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri]].<ref name=wsjegypt/><ref name="telegraph2"/> The bombs were probably designed to detonate mid-air, with the intention of destroying both planes over Chicago or another city in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11671377 | title=Parcel bomb plotters 'used dry run', say US officials | work=BBC News | date=November 2, 2010 | accessdate=November 12, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111070713/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11671377 | archive-date=November 11, 2010 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Gardner | first=Frank | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11661496 | title=Dubai bomb was flown on passenger planes | work=BBC News | date=October 31, 2010 | accessdate=October 31, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101051240/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11661496 | archive-date=November 1, 2010 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Each bomb had already been transported on passenger and [[cargo plane]]s at the time of discovery.

==Responsibility==

===Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula===
On November 5, 2010, [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP) took responsibility for the plot,<ref name="autogenerated2"/> posting on a number of radical Islamist websites monitored by the [[SITE Institute|SITE Intelligence Group]] and the [[NEFA Foundation]]. "We will continue to strike blows against American interests and the interest of America's allies," said the perpetrators.
