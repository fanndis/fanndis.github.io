==Early life and education==
[[File:C. DELORES TUCKER MANSION, NORTH PHILADELPHIA.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Tucker's house on Lincoln Drive in Philadelphia]]
Born in [[Philadelphia]] to a [[Minister of religion|minister]] Whitfield Nottage from the Bahamas and a "Christian feminist mother" Captilda Gardiner Nottage from the Bahamas on October 4, 1927, Tucker was the tenth of thirteen children.<ref name=NYT>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/us/c-delores-tucker-a-voice-for-minorities-and-women-is-dead-at-78.html New York Times - C. DeLores Tucker, a Voice for Minorities and Women, Is Dead at 78 - November 6, 2005]</ref> Tucker attended [[Temple University]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wharton School of Business]]. Tucker was later the recipient of two [[honorary degree|honorary doctoral]] degrees from [[Morris College]] in [[Sumter, South Carolina]] and [[California State University Northridge ]] in [[California]], and for this reason, she is sometimes referred to as "Dr. C. Delores Tucker".

==Career==
===Civil activities===
Tucker had a long history in the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Early on, her civil activities included participating in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] alongside the Rev. Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and raising funds for the [[NAACP]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. C.

(NCBW), having succeeded the Hon. [[Shirley Chisholm]] in 1992.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} 

Tucker also was responsible for the Governor's appointment of more women judges and more women and [[African Americans]] to boards and commissions than ever before. She also led the effort to make [[Pennsylvania]] one of the first [[U.S. state|states]] to pass the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. As Chief of Elections of Pennsylvania, she was a leader in instituting a voter registration by mail and reducing the voting age from 21 to 18 years of age.

===Political===
In 1971, Tucker became the first black female [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]] when [[Governor of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Governor]] [[Milton Shapp]] appointed her [[Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]]. During her tenure, she instituted the first [[Commission on the Status of Women]].<ref name="umd">[http://www.welfareacademy.org/conf/papers/tucker_bio.shtml Dr. C. DeLores Tucker].

She was the founder and president of the Bethune-DuBois Institute, Inc., which she established in 1991 to promote the cultural development of [[African American]] youth through scholarships and educational programs.<ref name="umd"/> Tucker also launched, and served as publisher of the publication, ''Vital Issues: The Journal of African American Speeches''.

===Media===
In 1988 she made an [[After_Dark_(TV_series)#"Derry_'68"|extended appearance]] on a British television discussion programme, ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]''.<ref>W. Stephen Gilbert, 'Talking Revolution', ''[[New Statesman]]'', 13 May 1988</ref>

==Hip-hop/rap music==
{{See|Misogyny in rap music}}

Tucker dedicated much of the last few years of her life to condemning sexually explicit lyrics in [[hip hop music|rap and hip-hop]] tracks, citing a concern that the lyrics were [[misogynistic]] and threatened the moral foundation of the African American community.<ref name="washingtonpost">{{cite news | last = Lamb| first = Yvonne Shinhoster | title = C.

Called "narrow-minded" by some rappers who often mentioned her in their lyrics, Tucker picketed stores that sold [[hip hop music|rap]] music and bought stock in [[Sony]], [[Time Warner]], and other companies in order to protest [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] at their shareholders' meetings.<ref name="washingtonpost"/> She also fought against the [[NAACP]]'s decision to nominate late rapper [[Tupac Shakur]] for one of its [[Image Awards]]<ref name="washingtonpost"/> and filed a $10 million lawsuit against his estate for comments that the rapper made in his song "[[How Do U Want It]]?"<ref name=NYT/> on the album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'', in which Shakur rapped ''"C. Delores Tucker you's a motherfucker / Instead of trying to help a nigga you destroy a brother"''. In her lawsuit, Tucker claimed that comments in this song, and on the track "Wonda Why They Call U Bitch" from the same album, inflicted emotional distress, were slanderous and invaded her privacy.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n15_v92/ai_19722943 | work=Jet | title=C.

Other rappers have taken similar stances. In his song "[[The Documentary|Church for Thugs]]", [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] raps "''I've got more hatred in my soul than Pac had for De'ores Tucker''." Jay-Z chimes in as well, with the lines "''I don't care if you're C. Dolores Tucker or you're Bill O'Reilly, you only riling me up''," from ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album's]]'' "Threat." [[Lil' Kim]] also referenced her in a leftover track, entitled "Rockin' It", from her second studio album. Kim raps "''C. Delores T., Screw her, I never knew her"'', after Tucker dubbed her music as "gangsta porno rap" and "filth".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B4b3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA633&lpg=PA633&dq=lil+kim+c+delores#v=onepage |title=Shadows of the Music Industry - Michael Hur - Google Books |date=2014-07-25 |isbn=9781312306059 |accessdate=2015-05-28|last1=Hur |first1=Michael }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/509640/lil-kims-music-called-filth-by-conservative-activist/ |title=Lil' Kim's Music Called "Filth" By Conservative Activist |publisher=MTV |date=1997-05-17 |accessdate=2010-05-28}}</ref> 

Much of [[KRS-One]] and [[Channel Live]]'s "Free Mumia" is a direct criticism of what the MCs see as Tucker's misplaced energy. [[Lil Wayne]] also referenced her a couple times, once on his leftover song "Million Dollar Baby" rapping "Can't be banned I'm sorry Miss Delores" and more recently on his [[Carter IV]] album song "Megaman" rapping "The heater ima Tucker, Tucker, like Delores." Tucker later went on to serve on the Advisory Board of the [[Parents Television Council]] until her death in 2005.<ref>[http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/aboutus/advisoryboard/drtucker.htm PTC Advisory Board Member - C.Delores Tucker<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181407/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/aboutus/advisoryboard/drtucker.htm |date=2007-09-30 }}</ref> Eminem referenced her in the song "Rap Game" by D12 rapping "Tell that C.

Tucker was also a prominent member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] sorority.<ref name="umd"/> 

On April 25, 2006, a state historical marker honoring Tucker was unveiled by Bill Tucker and Governor [[Ed Rendell]] in a ceremony at the [[State Museum of Pennsylvania]], in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. In addition, it was announced that the North Building, which is adjacent to the [[Pennsylvania State Capitol|State Capitol Building]], was to be renamed the Secretary C. Delores Tucker Building.
