A '''soldier''' is one who fights as part of a [[military]].  A soldier can be a [[Conscription|conscripted]] or volunteer [[Enlisted rank|enlisted person]], a [[non-commissioned officer]], or an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]. In other definition, soldiers are military personnel that participate in ground, sea, or air forces, commonly known as armies, navies, and air forces, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|title=soldier - Dictionary Definition|url=https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/soldier|access-date=2020-07-19|website=Vocabulary.com}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''soldier'' derives from the [[Middle English]] word {{lang|enm|soudeour}}, from [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|soudeer}} or {{lang|fro|soudeour}}, meaning mercenary, from {{lang|fro|soudee}}, meaning [[shilling]]'s worth or wage, from {{lang|fro|[[sou (coin)|sou]]}} or {{lang|fro|soud}}, shilling.<ref name = Merriam-Webster>{{cite encyclopedia |editor= Mish, Frederick C. |encyclopedia= Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |title= soldier |edition= 11th |year= 2004 |publisher= Merriam-Webster |location= Springfield, MA |isbn= 0-87779-809-5 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/merriamwebstersc00merr_6 }}</ref> The word is also related to the [[Medieval Latin]] {{lang|la|soldarius}}, meaning soldier (literally, "one having pay").<ref name = Etymological>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/ |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |author = Harper, Douglas |year=2010 |accessdate=17 August 2010 }}</ref> These words ultimately derive from the [[Late Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]}}, referring to an [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] coin used in the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name = Merriam-Webster /><ref name = Etymological />

==Occupational designations==
In most armies use of the word "soldier" has taken on a more general meaning due to the increasing specialization of military occupations that require different areas of knowledge and skill-sets. As a result, "soldiers" are referred to by names or ranks which reflect an individual's military occupation specialty arm, service, or branch of military employment, their type of unit, or operational employment or technical use such as: [[Trooper (rank)|trooper]], [[tank]]er (a member of tank crew), [[commando]], [[dragoon]], [[infantryman]], [[artilleryman]], [[paratrooper]], [[grenadier]], [[Ranger (disambiguation)#Military|ranger]], [[sniper]], [[Combat Engineer|engineer]], [[sapper]], [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers|craftsman]], [[signaller]], [[Combat medic|medic]], or a [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]].

==Other terms==
In many countries soldiers serving in specific occupations are referred to by terms other than their occupational name. For example, [[military police]] personnel in the [[British Army]] are known as "red caps" because of the colour of their caps (and berets).

[[Infantry]] are sometimes called "grunts" (in the [[United States Army]]) or "squaddies" (in the British Army), while U.S. Army artillery crews, or "gunners," are sometimes referred to as "redlegs", from the service branch color for [[artillery]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} U.S. soldiers are often called "[[G.I. (military)|G.I.s]]" (short for the term "General Issue").

[[Troupes de marine|French Marine Infantry]] are called marsouins ({{lang-fr|porpoises}}) because of their amphibious role.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Military units in most armies have nicknames of this type, arising either from items of distinctive [[Military uniform|uniform]], some historical connotation or rivalry between branches or regiments.

== Career soldiers and conscripts ==
Some soldiers, such as [[Conscription|conscripts]] or draftees, serve a single limited term. Others choose to serve until retirement; then they receive a pension and other benefits. In the United States, military members can retire after 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=20-Year Retirement |url=http://www.armytimes.com/careers/retirement/military_retirement_2007hbml/ |publisher=Armytimes.com |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref> In other countries, the term of service is 30 years, hence the term "30-year man".

===Women as soldiers===

According to the United Nations, 10–30% of all soldiers worldwide are women. 70–90% are men.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/youthenvoy/armed-conflict//|title=#YouthStats: Armed Conflict|publisher=United Nations Office of Secretary General}}</ref>
