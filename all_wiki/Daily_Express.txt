The paper was acquired by [[Richard Desmond]]'s company [[Northern & Shell]] in 2000. [[Hugh Whittow]] was the editor from February 2011 until he retired in March 2018.

In February 2018 Trinity Mirror acquired the ''Daily Express'', and other publishing assets of Northern & Shell, in a deal worth £126.7&nbsp;million.

The ''Express'' began printing in Manchester in 1927. In 1931 it moved its London headquarters to [[Daily Express Building, London|120 Fleet Street]], a specially commissioned [[art deco]] building.

The ASA noted that the pieces were "always and uniquely favourable to the product featured in the ads and contained claims that have been or were likely to be prohibited in advertisements".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/12/express-newspapers-advertorials-richard-desmond-asa |title=ASA raps Richard Desmond's Express Newspapers over advertorials |last=Sweney |first=Mark |date=12 August 2009 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=15 August 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_46700.htm |publisher=ASA |title=ASA Adjudications : Express Newspapers and Goldshield Ltd |access-date=15 August 2009 |date=12 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815132414/http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_46700.htm |archive-date=15 August 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_46734.htm |title=ASA Adjudications : Express Newspapers and LadyCare Lifetime Ltd |publisher=ASA |access-date=15 August 2009 |date=12 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815132502/http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_46734.htm |archive-date=15 August 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Stephen Brook and agencies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/19/asa-daily-express-advertorial |title=Express censured for fourth time in two weeks over undeclared advertorials |newspaper=The Guardian|location= London |date=19 August 2009 |access-date=2 May 2010 }}</ref>

In January 2010, the ''Daily Express'' was censured by the Advertising Standards Authority over a front-page promotion for "free" fireworks. This led to comment that the ''Express'' has become "the Ryanair of Fleet Street", in that it is a "frequent offender" which pays little heed to the ASA's criticisms.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brook |first=Stephen |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2010/jan/27/express-banned-advertising-desmond |title=Daily Express is the Rynair of Fleet Street |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=27 January 2010 |access-date=2 May 2010 }}</ref>

In May 2010, Desmond announced a commitment of £100&nbsp;million over five years to buy new equipment for the printing plants, beginning with the immediate purchase of four new presses, amid industry rumours that he was going to establish a printing plant at Luton.

On 31 December 2010, the Express, with all the media titles in Desmond's [[Northern & Shell]] group, were excluded from the [[Press Complaints Commission]] after withholding payment.<ref name="guardian20110111">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/jan/11/richard-desmond-pcc |title=Desmond's papers excluded from system of press self-regulation |last=Greenslade |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Greenslade |date=11 January 2011 |work=The Guardian |location= London |access-date=16 January 2011}}</ref> [[Guy Black, Baron Black of Brentwood|Lord Black]], chairman of [[Press Standards Board of Finance|PressBof]], the PCC's parent organisation, called this "a deeply regrettable decision".<ref name="guardian20110111"/> According to ''Press Gazette'', in December 2016 circulation figures showed gross sales of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' were 1,491,264 compared to 391,626 for the ''Daily Express''.<ref name="circ"/>

==Controversies==

===John Bodkin Adams===
Suspected [[serial killer]] [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]] was arrested in 1956, accused of murdering up to 400 wealthy patients in [[Eastbourne]], England.<ref name=Cullen>{{cite book|last1=Cullen|first1=Pamela V. Halliday|title=A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams|date=2006|publisher=Elliott & Thompson|location=London|isbn=1-904027-19-9}}</ref> The press, "egged on by police leaks, unanimously declared Adams guilty," except for [[Percy Hoskins]], chief crime reporter for the ''Express''.<ref name=Hoskins>''Two Men Were Acquitted: The trial and acquittal of Doctor John Bodkin Adams'', Secker & Warburg, 1984</ref> Hoskins was adamant that Adams was a naive doctor prosecuted by an overzealous detective, [[Herbert Hannam]], whom Hoskins disliked from previous cases.<ref name=Hoskins/> The ''Express'', under Hoskins's direction, was the only major paper to defend Adams, causing [[Lord Beaverbrook]] to question Hoskins's stance.<ref name=Hoskins/>

Adams was cleared in 1957 of the murder of [[Edith Alice Morrell]] (a second count was withdrawn controversially). After the case, Beaverbrook phoned Hoskins and said: "Two people were acquitted today", meaning Hoskins as well.<ref name=Hoskins/> The ''Express'' carried an exclusive interview with Adams, whom Hoskins interviewed in a safe house away from other newspapers. According to archives released in 2003, Adams was thought by police to have killed 163 patients.<ref name=Cullen/>

===Dunblane===
{{Main|Sunday Express Dunblane controversy}}

On 8 March 2009, the Scottish edition of the ''Sunday Express'' published a front-page article critical of survivors of the 1996 [[Dunblane massacre]], entitled "Anniversary Shame of Dunblane Survivors". The article criticised the 18-year-old survivors for posting "shocking blogs and photographs of themselves on the internet", revealing that they drank alcohol, made rude gestures and talked about their sex lives.<ref>{{cite web|last=Luft|first=Oliver|last2=Carrell|first2=Severin|date=23 March 2009|title=Scottish Sunday Express apologises for Dunblane survivors story|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/23/scottish-sunday-express-dunblane-apology|access-date=3 February 2016|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> The article provoked complaints, leading to a front-page apology a [[fortnight]] later.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/90417|title=Dunblane: We're Sorry|work=Sunday Express|date=22 March 2009|access-date=16 March 2010}}</ref> The [[Press Complaints Commission]] described the article as a "serious error of judgement" and said, "Although the editor had taken steps to resolve the complaint, and rightly published an apology, the breach of the Code was so serious that no apology could remedy it".

===Diana, Princess of Wales===
The ''Daily Express'' had a reputation for printing [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] as front-page news. ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2006 both published a selection of recent ''Express'' headlines on the topic.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jack|first=Louise|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-express-and-diana-cover-ups-spies-and-conspiracies-429277.html|title=''The Express'' and Diana: Cover-ups, spies and conspiracies|work=The Independent|date=18 December 2006|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/may/09/pressandpublishing.themonarchy|title=Any old Diana headline here|work=The Guardian|date=9 May 2006|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> This practice was satirised in ''[[Private Eye]]'' as the ''Diana Express'' or the ''Di'ly Express'', and has been attributed to Desmond's friendship with regular ''Eye'' target [[Mohamed Al Fayed|Mohamed Fayed]].<ref group=note>For instance in the "Hackwatch" column of ''Private Eye'' #1174, 19 December 2006.</ref> The articles regularly quoted Fayed with the newspaper describing its campaign as "Our relentless crusade for the truth".<ref>{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=Martyn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZPJjwm6ITMC&pg=PT141|title=Diana: The Last Days|location=London|publisher=Virgin Books|year=2007|page=141|isbn=9780753544310}}</ref> In 2006 and 2007, these front-page stories consistently appeared on Mondays, and ended only when the paper focused instead on the [[Madeleine McCann]] story (see below).

Even on 7 July 2006, the anniversary of the [[7/7|London bombings]] (used by most other newspapers to publish commemorations) the front page was given over to Diana. This tendency was also mocked on ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' when on 6 November 2006, the day other papers reported the death sentence given to [[Saddam Hussein]] on their front pages, the ''Express'' led with "SPIES COVER UP DIANA 'MURDER'".

According to ''[[The Independent]]'' "The Diana stories appear on Mondays because Sunday is often a quiet day."<ref name="Independent Hill">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/peter-hill-an-appetite-for-battle-467118.html|title=Peter Hill: An appetite for battle|date= 20 February 2006|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|first1=Raymond|last1=Snoddy|access-date=11 June 2014}}</ref> In February and March 2010 the paper returned to featuring Diana stories on the front page on Mondays.

In September 2013, following an allegation raised by the estranged wife of an [[Special Air Service|SAS]] operative, the ''Daily Express'' returned to running daily Princess Diana cover stories.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/428276/SAS-quizzed-over-Diana-death|title=SAS quizzed over Diana death|newspaper=Daily Express|date= 10 September 2013|first1=John|last1=Twomey|access-date=11 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/429017/Army-slated-for-not-taking-allegations-of-SAS-aided-Diana-death-seriously|title=Army slated for not taking allegations of SAS aided death seriously|newspaper=Daily Express|date= 13 September 2013|access-date=11 June 2014|first1=John|last1=Twomey}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/429312/EXCLUSIVE-How-David-Cameron-knew-of-Princess-Diana-murder-plot|title=How David Cameron knew of Princess Diana murder plot|newspaper=Daily Express|date= 14 September 2013|access-date=11 June 2014|first1=John|last1=Twomey}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/429536/EXCLUSIVE-SAS-s-lamping-unit-used-laser-to-dazzle-Princess-Diana-s-driver|title=SAS's lamping unit used laser to dazzle Diana's driver|newspaper=Daily Express|date= 15 September 2013|access-date=11 June 2014|first1=Donal |last1=MacIntyre}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/429799/Soldier-s-claim-SAS-ordered-to-kill-Princess-Diana-ups-pressure-for-murder-investigation|title=Soldier's claim SAS ordered to kill Princess Diana ups pressure for murder investigation|newspaper=Daily Express|date= 16 September 2013|access-date=11 June 2014|first1=Giles|last1= Sheldrick}}</ref>

===Madeleine McCann===
In the second half of 2007 the ''Daily Express'' gave a large coverage to the [[disappearance of Madeleine McCann]]. From 3 August 2007 to 10 November 2007, the ''Express'' dedicated at least part of the next 100 front pages to her. Of those, 82 used the headline to feature the details of the disappearance (often stylised by "MADELEINE" in red block capitals, plus a picture of the child).

Though the family initially said some journalists may have "overstepped their mark" they acknowledged the benefits in keeping the case in the public eye,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=3587167&page=4 | title=From Victims to Villains | publisher=ABC News | date=12 September 2007}}</ref> but said coverage needed to be toned down since daily headlines were not necessarily helpful.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1644291.0.i_dont_think_necessarily_having_newspaper_headlines_with_the_image_of_madeleine_being_thrust_on_to_people_every_single_day_helps_clearly_we_have_seen_irresponsible_reporting.php | title=I don't think necessarily having newspaper headlines with the image of Madeleine being thrust on to people every single day helps. Clearly we have seen irresponsible reporting. | work=Sunday Herald | date=26 August 2007}}{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref> In March 2008, the McCanns launched a [[libel]] suit against the ''Daily Express'' and the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'', as well as their Sunday equivalents, following their coverage. The action concerned more than 100 stories across the four newspapers, which accused the McCanns of causing and covering up their daughter's death.<ref name="Damages due"/> Express Newspapers pulled all references to Madeleine from its websites.<ref>{{cite news

In a settlement at the [[High Court of Justice]], the newspapers ran a front-page apology to the McCanns on 19 March 2008, another apology on the front of the Sunday editions of 23 March and a statement of apology at the High Court. The newspapers also agreed to pay costs and damages, which the McCanns said they would use to fund the search for their daughter.<ref name="Damages due">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7303801.stm | title=Damages due over McCann stories |work=BBC News | date=18 March 2008}}</ref> ''Guardian'' media commentator [[Roy Greenslade]] said it was "unprecedented" for four major newspapers to offer front-page apologies but also said it was more than warranted given that the papers had committed "a substantial libel" that shamed the British press.<ref>{{cite news |author=Roy Greenslade |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2008/mar/19/expressandstarapologiesto |title=Express and Star apologies to McCanns bring all journalism into disrepute |work=The Guardian |access-date=1 June 2015}}</ref> [[Craig Silverman]] of ''Regret the Error'',  a blog that reports media errors, argued that given how many of the stories appeared on the front page, anything less than a front-page apology would have been "unacceptable."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regrettheerror.com/2008/03/19/daily-express-daily-star-issue-front-page-apologies-pay-damages |title=Poynter |work=Regret the Error |access-date=18 May 2015}}</ref>

In its apology, the ''Express'' said "a number of articles in the newspaper have suggested that the couple caused the death of their missing daughter Madeleine and then covered it up. We acknowledge that there is no evidence whatsoever to support this theory and that Kate and Gerry are completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter's disappearance."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/38490 | title=Kate and Gerry McCann: Sorry |work=Daily Express |location=UK | date=19 March 2008}}</ref> This was followed in October by an apology and payout (forwarded to the fund again) to a group who had become known as the "[[Tapas Seven]]" in relation to the case.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7673148.stm |title=Libel payout for McCann friends |work=BBC News |date=16 October 2008 |access-date=18 May 2015}}</ref>

In a statement released by The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) on 24 April 2015, the tabloid's name was mentioned in an accusation of producing [[hate speech]], initially referring to an article in [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']]: "...To give just one glimpse of the scale of the problem, back in 2003 the ''Daily Express'' ran 22 negative front pages stories about asylum seekers and refugees in a single 31-day period" ... "..the High Commissioner noted that Article 20 of the ICCPR, as well as elements relating to hate speech in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination* (both of which have been ratified by the U.K., as well as by all other EU countries), were rooted in the desire to outlaw the type of anti-Semitic and other racially based hate speech used by the Nazi media during the 1930s".<ref>{{cite press release |author=UNOHCHR |url= http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15885 |date=24 April 2015 |title=UN Human Rights Chief urges U.K. to tackle tabloid hate speech, after migrants were called "cockroaches" |publisher=United Nations |location=Geneva |access-date=25 June 2017}}</ref>

Appearing in April 2018 before Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee, which was investigating the treatment of minority groups in print media, ''Daily Express'' editor Gary Jones said that he would be looking to change the tone of the paper. Jones said that he had found past pages of the newspaper "downright offensive," adding that they made him feel "very uncomfortable" and contributed to an "Islamophobic sentiment" in the media.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/24/daily-express-editor-gary-jones-calls-its-front-pages-downright-offensive |title=Daily Express editor calls its front pages 'downright offensive' |first=Jim |last=Waterson |date=24 April 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London}}</ref>

==="Crusade for Freedom"===
This was the newspaper's own campaign to give the people of the United Kingdom the opportunity to add their names to a petition addressed to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in favour of Britain's withdrawal from the [[European Union]]. Each edition of the 8 January 2011 issue had four cut-out vouchers where readers could sign the pledge and send them to the paper's HQ where the petition was being compiled; there were also further editions with the same voucher included.<ref>"A crusade for freedom", ''Daily Express'', page 55, 8 January 2011.</ref> The campaign attracted the support of many celebrities including sportsman/TV personality Sir [[Ian Botham]]<ref>"Botham backs our drive for public vote on Europe", ''Daily Express'', page 59, 8 January 2011.</ref> and Chairman of [[J D Wetherspoon]] [[Tim Martin (businessman)|Tim Martin]]<ref>"Euro red tape is strangling UK enterprise", ''Daily Express'', page 69, 8 January 2011.</ref> who both gave interviews for 8 January's special edition of the paper. The first week of the campaign saw a response of around 370,000 signatures being received (just over 50% of daily readership or around 0.6% of the UK population).
