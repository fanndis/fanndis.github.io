A '''compilation album''' comprises [[Album#Tracks|track]]s, which may be previously released or unreleased, usually from several separate recordings by either one or several [[Performing arts#Performers|performers]].

== Content and scope ==
Songs included on a compilation album may be previously released or unreleased, usually from several separate recordings by either one or several [[performers]]. If by one artist, then generally the tracks were not originally intended for release together as a single work, but may be collected together as a [[greatest hits album]] or [[box set]]. Compilation albums may employ traditional [[product bundling]] strategies.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

According to sound technician [[Richard King (sound designer)|Richard King]], [[classical music]] compilations "may require more processing to match tracks coming from various sources and recording venues as well as the different sizes of ensembles."<ref>{{cite book|last=King|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard King (sound designer)|page=223|title=Recording Orchestra and Other Classical Music Ensembles|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2016|isbn=978-1317520818}}</ref>

In ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] said, "While compilation albums by [[album era|album artists]] (as opposed to stylistically unified singles specialists) are often useless, sometimes they present themselves as events", citing as examples the 1971 [[Ray Charles]] LP ''A 25th Anniversary in Show Business Salute to Ray Charles'', ''[[The Kink Kronikles]]'' (1972), and ''[[Changesonebowie]]'' (1976).<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=0899190251|chapter=The Criteria|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/criteria.php|via=robertchristgau.com|accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>

==Common types==
Common types of compilation include:

* '''"[[Greatest hits album|Greatest hits]]", "best of", or "singles collection"''' LPs, gathering together an artist's or a group's best-known songs. If the artist or group continues to record, compilers commonly include one or more previously unreleased tracks as an incentive for fans to buy the album, even if they already have the other material on the compilation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://pitchfork.com/news/52388-tlc-to-release-greatest-hits-compilation-to-accompany-biopic-new-album-coming-in-2014/ |title= TLC to Release Greatest Hits Compilation to Accompany Biopic, New Album Coming in 2014 |date= 23 September 2013 |accessdate= 1 December 2013 |work= Pitchfork}}</ref>
* '''Other single-artist compilations''', such as rarities or [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] collections, albums compiled from radio sessions, songs performed by an artist exclusively for a [[Soundtrack|film soundtrack]] or collections that combine multiple releases, such as LPs and [[Extended play|EP]]s together on one or more compact discs. Such compilations generally target existing fans of the artist and have little [[mainstream]] appeal, though [[Autopsy|postmortem]] compilations of unreleased materials from recently deceased artists have significant popularity.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* '''[[Box set]]s''', elaborate multi-disc collections often covering the entire breadth of an artist's career or the full sweep of an entire record label or genre. Many [[anthology|anthologies]] are released in this format.
* '''Various artist themed compilations''', e.g. love songs, Christmas songs, songs featuring a particular instrument (such as saxophone or piano), [[one-hit wonder]]s, and countless other variations. Original work by various artists for a single album or single, such as Phil Spector's A Christmas Gift For You or Band-Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas? (Feed The World) occasionally get erroneously mentioned as compilation albums or singles due to the fact that the songs are a compilation of various singers or musicians, however, they are original albums, not compilation albums.  
* '''Various artist genre compilations''', e.g. [[jazz]], [[synthpop]], rock, etc. These may be from the same time period (Year, decade or era, for example.), or may incorporate a common theme, as a soundtrack exemplifies well.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deadmau5-compilation-we-are-friends-vol-2-album-premiere-20131108 |title= Deadmau5 Compilation 'We Are Friends Vol. 2' – Album Premiere |date= 8 November 2013 |accessdate= 1 December 2013 |first= John |last= Gentile |work= Rolling Stone}}</ref>
* '''Various artist hit compilations'''. This has been a very successful part of the album market since the early 1970s. Recent hit [[single (music)|singles]] are gathered together in one place. In the 1970s, these were often single [[vinyl record|vinyl LPs]] with 10 to 12 tracks or more. In the 1980s, a [[double album]] with 6 or 8 tracks on each side became the norm. Now that CDs are the dominant format, these compilations are usually released on one, two, or three CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.sky.com/story/1174752/now-compilation-albums-celebrate-30-years |title= Now Compilation Albums Celebrate 30 Years |date= 28 November 2013 |accessdate= 1 December 2013 |first= Richard |last= Suchet |work= Sky News}}</ref>
* '''Promotional compilations''' or '''[[Sampler album|samplers]]'''. These are creative, successful forms of promotion for artists or record labels to promote their music. Generally, these types of releases are free or cost very little for the consumer or end listener.  [[Elektra Records]] released the first sampler albums in the 1950s.
* '''Private label promotional compilations'''. Promotional compilation CDs can be private labeled for products, retail outlets, or commercial organizations or non-profit organizations. Artists and labels like to co-brand themselves with well-known brands for marketing purposes, and transversely well-known brands like to co-brand themselves with artists.
* '''Business-to-business promotional compilations'''. The music industry may use other types of promotional compilations within a [[business-to-business]] context to promote artists to media concerns (radio stations, music supervisors for TV, film or video games for synchronization)
* '''Composer/producer albums/record label'''. Many hip hop producers will release a compilation album which features various artists, but with each track composed by the same producer or it is under the same record label.

==Royalties==
For multi-artist compilations, [[Royalty payment|royalties]] are usually pro-rated. In most cases, each artist's per-record royalty rate (typically 12–14% in 1999)<ref name=McPherson>{{cite book|author=Brian McPherson|title=Get It in Writing: The Musician's Guide to the Music Business|date=1999|publisher=Hal Leonard Corp.|isbn=9780793566990|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQ_ziZAzg1EC&pg=PA68|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref> is divided by the number of artists on the album. However, some record companies opt to simplify the equation and pay a rounded-off rate, either as a percentage or as a set amount, regardless of the total number of artists on the record. {{As of|1999}}, these rates were around 1/2% to 1% or 15–16 cents per record.<ref name=McPherson/> When a compilation album includes a track from a different record company, the royalties are split between the artist and the original record company.<ref name=McPherson/> Unless specifically limited by a contract, record companies may release as many greatest hits albums by their recording artist as they wish without requiring the artist's agreement or permission.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQ_ziZAzg1EC&pg=PA89|author=Brian McPherson|title=Get It in Writing: The Musician's Guide to the Music Business|date=1999|publisher=Hal Leonard Corp.|isbn=9780793566990|page=89}}</ref>

==Charts==
In the United Kingdom, [[Official Charts Company|The Official Charts Company]] compiles a weekly compilation albums chart, limited to various artists compilations and soundtrack compilations.<ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/compilations UK Top 40 Compilation Albums]", [[BBC]], retrieved 2012-04-01</ref>
