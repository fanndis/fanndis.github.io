The '''Gullah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ʌ|l|ə}}) are [[African Americans]] who live in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] region of the U.S. states of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida (U.S. state)|Florida]], and [[South Carolina]], in both the coastal plain and the [[Sea Islands]]. They developed a [[creole language]], also called [[Gullah language|Gullah]], and a culture with some African influence.

Historically, the Gullah region extended from the [[Cape Fear (headland)|Cape Fear]] area on [[North Carolina|North Carolina's]] coast south to the vicinity of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] on [[Florida|Florida's]] coast. Today, the Gullah area is confined to the Georgia and South Carolina Lowcountry. The Gullah people and their language are also called '''Geechee''', which may be derived from the name of the [[Ogeechee River]] near [[Savannah, Georgia]].<ref name="Gomez2000">{{cite book|author=Michael A.

Because of a period of relative isolation from whites while working on large [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] in rural areas, the Africans, enslaved from a variety of Central and West African ethnic groups, developed a creole culture that has preserved much of their African linguistic and cultural heritage from various peoples; in addition, they absorbed new influences from the region. The Gullah people speak an [[English-based creole language]] containing many African [[loanwords]] and influenced by [[African languages]] in grammar and sentence structure. Sometimes referred to as "Sea Island Creole" by linguists and scholars, the Gullah language is sometimes likened to [[Bahamian Creole]], [[Barbadian Creole]], [[Guyanese Creole]], [[Belizean Creole]], [[Jamaican Patois]] and the [[Krio language]] of [[West Africa]]. Gullah crafts, farming and fishing traditions, folk beliefs, music, rice-based cuisine and story-telling traditions all exhibit strong influences from Central and West African cultures.<ref name="Prahlad2016">{{cite book|author=Anand Prahlad|title=African American Folklore: An Encyclopedia for Students: An Encyclopedia for Students|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x92uDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA139|date=31 August 2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-930-3|page=139}}</ref><ref name="ShujaaShujaa2015">{{cite book|author1=Mwalimu J.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word "Gullah" is unclear. Some scholars suggest that it may be cognate with the word "[[Angola]]",<ref name="Gomez2000" /><ref name="Sumpter2006">{{cite web|author1=Althea Sumpter, Georgia Institute of Technology, and NGE Staff|title=Geechee and Gullah Culture|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/geechee-and-gullah-culture|publisher=Georgia Humanities Council and the University of Georgia Press|access-date=30 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406015809/http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/geechee-and-gullah-culture|archive-date=April 6, 2016|date=March 31, 2006}}</ref> where the ancestors of some of the Gullah people likely originated. They created a new culture synthesized from that of the various African peoples brought into Charleston and other parts of South Carolina. Some scholars have suggested that it may come from the name of the ''[[Gola people|Gola]],'' an ethnic group living in the border area between present-day Sierra Leone and [[Liberia]] in West Africa, another area of enslaved ancestors of the Gullah people.<ref name="Opala2006">{{cite web|author=Joseph A. Opala|title=Bunce Island in Sierra Leone|url=http://www.glc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/publichistory/opala.pdf|publisher=Yale University|access-date=30 July 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218070249/http://glc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/publichistory/opala.pdf|archive-date=18 December 2015}}</ref><ref name="Gomez2000" /> British planters in the Caribbean and the Southern colonies of North America referred to this area as the "Grain Coast" or "Rice Coast"; many of the tribes are of [[Mandé]] or Manding origins. The name "Geechee", another common name for the Gullah people, may derive from the name of the ''[[Kissi people]]'', an ethnic group living in the border area between Sierra Leone, [[Guinea]] and Liberia.<ref name="Gomez2000" />

Still another possible linguistic source for "Gullah" are the [[Dyula people|Dyula]] ethnic group of West Africa, from whom the American Gullah might be partially descended. The [[Dyula people|Dyula]] civilization had a large territory that stretched from Senegal through Mali to Burkina Faso and the rest of what was [[French West Africa]]. These were vast savanna lands with lower population densities. Slave raiding was easier and more common here than in forested areas with natural forms of physical defenses. The word "[[Dyula people|Dyula]]" is pronounced "Gwullah" among members of the [[Akan people|Akan]] ethnic group in [[Ghana]] and [[Cote D'Ivoire]]. The primary land route through which captured [[Dyula people]] then came into contact with European slavers, was through the "Grain Coast" and "Rice Coast" (present-day Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegambia, and Guinea).

Some scholars have also suggested indigenous American origins for these words. The Spanish named the South Carolina and Georgia coastal region as ''[[Guale]]'', after a Native American tribe. The name of the [[Ogeechee River]], a prominent geographical feature in coastal Georgia and central to Guale territory, may have been derived from a [[Creek Indian]] ([[Muskogee language]]) word.<ref name="Matory2015">{{cite book|author=J.

===African roots===
 
According to Port of Charleston records, enslaved Africans shipped to the port came from the following areas: [[Angola]] (39%), [[Senegambia]] (20%), the [[Windward Coast]] (17%), the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] (13%), [[Sierra Leone]] (6%), and [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], and the two Bights (viz., [[Bight of Benin|Benin]] and [[Bight of Biafra|Biafra]]) (5% combined) (Pollitzer, 1999:43).<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/ethnography/research/docs/ggsrs_book.pdf ''Low Country Gullah Culture Special Resource Study and Final Environmental Impact Statement''], National Park Service, Southeast Regional Office, p. 3</ref> The term "Windward Coast" often referred to Sierra Leone,<ref name="Carney2009">{{cite book|author=Judith Ann Carney|title=Black Rice: The African Origins of Rice Cultivation in the Americas|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YXWkwXHFWf0C&pg=PA90|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02921-7|page=90}}</ref> so the total figure of slaves from that region is higher than 6%.

Particularly along the western coast, the local peoples had cultivated [[African rice]] for what is estimated to approach 3,000 years. African rice is a related, yet distinct species from [[Asian rice]]. It was originally domesticated in the inland delta of the Upper [[Niger River]].<ref name=linares>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.252604599|issn=1091-6490| volume = 99| issue = 25| pages = 16360–16365| last = Linares| first = Olga F.| title = African rice (''Oryza glaberrima''): History and future potential| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| date = 2002-12-10| pmid = 12461173| pmc=138616|bibcode=2002PNAS...9916360L}}</ref><ref name=genome>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/ng.3044| pmid = 25064006| issn = 1061-4036| volume = 46| issue = 9| pages = 982–988| last1 = Wang| first1 = Muhua| last2 = Yu| first2 = Yeisoo| last3 = Haberer| first3 = Georg| last4 = Marri| first4 = Pradeep Reddy| last5 = Fan| first5 = Chuanzhu| last6 = Goicoechea| first6 = Jose Luis| last7 = Zuccolo| first7 = Andrea| last8 = Song| first8 = Xiang| last9 = Kudrna| first9 = Dave| last10 = Ammiraju| first10 = Jetty S.

Two British trading companies based in England operated the slave castle at [[Bunce Island]] (formerly called Bance Island), located in the [[Sierra Leone River]]. [[Henry Laurens]] was their main contact in Charleston and was a [[Planter class|planter]] and slave trader. His counterpart in Britain was the Scottish merchant and slave trader [[Richard Oswald (merchant)|Richard Oswald]]. Many of the enslaved Africans taken in West Africa were processed through Bunce Island. It was a prime export site for slaves to South Carolina and Georgia. Slave castles in Ghana, by contrast, shipped many of the people they handled to ports and markets in the Caribbean islands.

After Freetown, Sierra Leone, was founded in the late 18th century by the British as a colony for poor blacks from London and [[black Loyalists]] from Nova Scotia, resettled after the [[American Revolutionary War]], they did not allow slaves to be taken from Sierra Leone. They tried to protect the people from kidnappers. In 1808 both Great Britain and the United States prohibited the African [[slave trade]]. After that date, the British, whose navy patrolled to [[Blockade of Africa|intercept slave ships]] off Africa, sometimes resettled Africans liberated from slave trader ships in Sierra Leone. Similarly, Americans sometimes settled freed slaves at [[Liberia]], a similar colony established in the early 19th century by the [[American Colonization Society]]. As it was a place for freed slaves and free blacks from the United States, some free blacks emigrated there voluntarily, for the chance to create their own society.

===Origin of Gullah culture===
[[File:Gullah1.PNG|thumb|The Gullah region once extended from SE North Carolina to NE Florida.]] The Gullah people have been able to preserve much of their African cultural heritage because of climate, geography, cultural pride, and patterns of importation of enslaved Africans. Enslaved persons from the Central Western region of Africa, originating primarily from the [[Mende people|Mende]] populations of what is today [[Sierra Leone]], and transported to some areas of Brazil (including [[Bahia]]), the enslaved Gullah-Gheechee people were traded in what was then Charlestowne, South Carolina. According to British historian P.E.H. Hair, Gullah culture developed as a creole culture in the colonies and United States from the peoples of many different African cultures who came together there. These included the [[Baga people|Baga]], [[Fula people|Fula]], [[Kissi people|Kissi]], [[Kpelle people|Kpelle]], [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]], [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]], [[Mende people|Mende]], [[Susu people|Susu]], [[Temne people|Temne]], [[Vai people|Vai]], and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] of the Rice Coast, and many from [[Angola]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Calabar]], [[West Congo]], and the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].

By the middle of the 18th century, thousands of acres in the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] Lowcountry, and the Sea Islands were developed as [[African rice]] fields. African farmers from the "Rice Coast" brought the skills for cultivation and tidal irrigation that made rice farming one of the most successful industries in early America.

The subtropical climate encouraged the spread of [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]], which were both carried and transmitted by mosquitoes. These tropical diseases were [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in Africa and had been carried by enslaved Africans to the colonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_rice.htm/|author=West, Jean M.|title=Rice and Slavery: A Fatal Gold Seede|website=Slavery in America|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206050437/http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_rice.htm|archive-date=2012-02-06}}</ref> Mosquitoes in the swamps and inundated rice fields of the Lowcountry picked up and spread the diseases to European [[settler]]s, as well. Malaria and yellow fever soon became endemic in the region.

Because they had acquired some [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] in their homeland, Africans were more resistant to these tropical fevers than were the Europeans. As the rice industry was developed, planters continued to import enslaved Africans. By about 1708, South Carolina had a black majority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/geography/slave_laws_SC.htm/ |title=South Carolina Slave Laws Summary and Record |website=Slavery in America |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318172059/http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/geography/slave_laws_SC.htm |archive-date=2012-03-18 }}</ref> [[Golden Isles of Georgia|Coastal Georgia]] developed a black majority after rice cultivation expanded there in the mid-18th century. Malaria and yellow fever became endemic. Fearing these diseases, many white planters and their families left the Lowcountry during the rainy spring and summer months when fevers ran rampant.<ref name="Opala2006b" /> Others lived mostly in cities such as Charleston rather than on the isolated plantations, especially those on the Sea Islands.

The planters left their European or African "rice drivers", or overseers, in charge of [[Rice production in the United States#Early history|the rice plantations]].<ref name="Opala2006b" /> These had hundreds of laborers, with African traditions reinforced by new imports from the same regions. Over time, the Gullah people developed a creole culture in which elements of African languages, cultures, and community life were preserved to a high degree. Their culture developed in a distinct way, different from that of the enslaved African Americans in states such as North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, where the enslaved lived in smaller groups, and had more sustained and frequent interactions with whites and British American culture.<ref name="Cassidy2020">{{cite journal |author1=Frederic G.

===Civil War period===
When the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]] began, the Union rushed to blockade [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] shipping. White planters on the Sea Islands, fearing an invasion by the US naval forces, abandoned their plantations and fled to the mainland. When Union forces arrived on the Sea Islands in 1861, they found the Gullah people eager for their freedom, and eager as well to defend it. Many Gullah served with distinction in the [[Union Army]]'s [[First South Carolina Volunteers]]. The Sea Islands were the first place in the South where slaves were freed. Long before the War ended, [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian]] missionaries from [[Pennsylvania]] came to start schools on the islands for the newly freed slaves. [[Penn Center (Saint Helena Island, South Carolina)|Penn Center]], now a Gullah community organization on [[Saint Helena Island, South Carolina|Saint Helena Island]], South Carolina, was founded as the first school for freed slaves.

After the Civil War ended, the Gullahs' isolation from the outside world increased in some respects. The rice planters on the mainland gradually abandoned their plantations and moved away from the area because of labor issues and hurricane damage to crops. Free blacks were unwilling to work in the dangerous and disease-ridden rice fields. A series of [[1893 Sea Islands Hurricane|hurricanes]] devastated the crops in the 1890s. Left alone in remote rural areas of the Lowcountry, the Gullah continued to practice their traditional culture with little influence from the outside world well into the 20th century.

===Recent history===
[[File:Gullah basket.JPG|right|thumb|Gullah basket]]
In the 20th century, some plantations were redeveloped as resort or hunting destinations by wealthy whites. Gradually more visitors went to the islands to enjoy their beaches and mild climate. Since the late 20th century, the Gullah people—led by Penn Center and other determined community groups—have been fighting to keep control of their traditional lands. Since the 1960s, resort development on the Sea Islands has greatly increased property values, threatening to push the Gullah off family lands which they have owned since [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation]]. They have fought back against uncontrolled development on the islands through community action, the courts, and the political process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1044360911.html/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924065945/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1044360911.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 September 2014|title=Gov.

The Gullah have also struggled to preserve their traditional culture in the face of much more contact with modern culture and media. In 1979, a translation of the [[New Testament]] into the Gullah language was begun.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.wycliffe.org/tag/gullah/|title=Gullah {{!}} Wycliffe Bible Translators USA|website=blog.wycliffe.org|access-date=2016-07-21|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919083958/https://blog.wycliffe.org/tag/gullah/|archive-date=2016-09-19}}</ref> The [[American Bible Society]] published ''De Nyew Testament'' in 2005.

This was also the most extensive collection of Gullah recordings, surpassing those of [[Lorenzo Dow Turner]]. The recordings have helped people develop an interest in the culture, because they get to hear the language and learn how to pronounce some words.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2011/11/25/2518739/gullah-language-bible-now-on-audio.html|title=Gullah-language Bible now on audio CDs|last=Smith|first=Bruce|work=[[The Sun News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2011-11-25|access-date=2011-11-26}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The Gullah achieved another victory in 2006 when the U.S. Congress passed the "[[Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor|Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Act]]"; it provided $10&nbsp;million over 10 years for the preservation and interpretation of historic sites in the Low Country relating to Gullah culture.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6283153/ Bill Will Provide Millions for Gullah Community, National Public Radio, October 17, 2006]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The [[National Heritage Area|Heritage Corridor]] will extend from southern North Carolina to northern Florida. The project will be administered by the US [[National Park Service]], with extensive consultation with the Gullah community.

The Gullah have also reached out to [[West Africa]]. Gullah groups made three celebrated "homecomings" to [[Sierra Leone]] in 1989, 1997, and 2005. Sierra Leone is at the heart of the traditional rice-growing region of West Africa where many of the Gullahs' ancestors originated. [[Bunce Island]], the British slave castle in Sierra Leone, sent many African captives to Charleston and Savannah during the mid- and late 18th century. These dramatic homecomings were the subject of three documentary films—''[[Family Across the Sea]]'' (1990), ''[[The Language You Cry In]]'' (1998), and ''[[Priscilla's Homecoming]]'' (in production).

=== African influences ===
*The Gullah word ''guber'' for [[peanut]] derives from the [[Kongo Language|Kikongo]] and [[Kimbundu]]  word ''N'guba''.
*Gullah rice dishes called "red rice" and "[[okra]] soup" are similar to West African "[[jollof rice]]" and "okra soup" and hog maws. Jollof rice is a traditional style of rice preparation brought by the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] people of West Africa.<ref>[http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_cuisine.htm Slavery in America<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919100626/http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_cuisine.htm|date=September 19, 2009}}</ref>
*The Gullah version of "[[gumbo]]" has its roots in African cooking. "Gumbo" is derived from a word in the ''[[Umbundu]]'' language of Angola, meaning okra, one of the dish's main ingredients.
*Gullah rice farmers once made and used [[mortar and pestle]]s and [[winnowing]] fanners similar in style to tools used by West African rice farmers.
*Gullah beliefs about "[[Boo Hag|hags]]" and "haunts" are similar to African beliefs about malevolent ancestors, [[witchcraft|witches]], and "devils" (forest spirits).
*Gullah "[[Hoodoo (folk magic)|root doctors]]" protect their clients against dangerous spiritual forces by using [[ritual]] objects similar to those employed by African [[witch doctor|traditional healers]].
*Gullah [[herbalism|herbal medicines]] are similar to traditional African remedies.
*The Gullah "seekin" ritual is similar to [[coming of age]] ceremonies in West African secret societies, such as the [[Poro]] and [[Sande society|Sande]].
*The Gullah [[ring shout]] is similar to ecstatic religious rituals performed in West and Central Africa.
*Gullah stories about "[[Br'er Rabbit|Bruh Rabbit]]" are similar to West and Central African [[trickster]] tales about the figures of the clever and conniving rabbit, spider, and tortoise.
*Gullah spirituals, shouts, and other musical forms employ the "[[call and response]]" method commonly used in African music.
*Gullah "sweetgrass baskets" are coil straw [[basket]]s made by the descendants of slaves in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry]]. They are nearly identical to traditional coil [[basket]]s made by the [[Wolof people]] in [[Senegal]].
*Gullah "strip [[quilt]]s" mimic the design of cloth woven with the traditional strip [[loom]] used throughout West Africa. [[Kente cloth]] from the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] and the [[Ewe people|Ewe]] peoples, as well as [[Akwete cloth]] from the [[Igbo people]] are woven on the strip loom.
* A non-English song, preserved by a Gullah family in coastal Georgia, was analyzed in the 1940s by linguist Lorenzo Turner and found to be a [[Mende people|Mende]] song from Sierra Leone. It is probably the longest text in an African language to survive the transatlantic crossing of enslaved Africans to the  present-day United States. Later, in the 1990s, researchers Joseph Opala, Cynthia Schmidt, and Taziff Koroma located a village in Sierra Leone where the song is still sung, and determined it is a funeral hymn. This research and the resulting reunion between Gullah and Mende families is recounted in the documentary ''The Language You Cry In'' (1998).<ref>{{cite journal|date=December 1999|title=Review: ''The Language You Cry In'': The Story of a Mende Song by Alvaro Toepke, Angel Serrano|journal=American Anthropologist|publisher=Wiley, on behalf of the American Anthropological Association|volume=101|pages=826–828|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.4.826|jstor=684061|author=Thomas-Houston, Marilyn M.|number=4}}</ref>

=== Cuisine ===
Rice is a staple food in Gullah communities and continues to be cultivated in abundance in the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. Rice is also an important food in West African cultures. As descendants of enslaved Africans, the Gullah continued the traditional food and food techniques of their ancestors, demonstrating another link to traditional African cultures. Rice is a core commodity of the Gullah food system: a meal was not considered complete without rice. There are strict rituals surrounding the preparation of rice in the Gullah communities. First, individuals would remove the darker grains from the rice, and then hand wash the rice numerous times before it was ready for cooking. The Gullah people would add enough water for the rice to steam on its own, but not so much that one would have to stir or drain it. These traditional techniques were passed down during the period of slavery and are still an important part of rice preparation by Gullah people.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beoku-Betts|first=Josephine|year=1995|title=We Got Our Way of Cooking Things: Women, Food, and Preservation of Cultural Identity among the Gullah|jstor=189895|journal=Gender and Society|volume=9|issue=5|pages=535–555|doi=10.1177/089124395009005003}}</ref>

===Celebrating Gullah culture===
[[File:Exhibit Showcases Endangered Culture Embraced by African Americans in US South.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:42|[[VOA]] report about an exhibit about Gullah culture]]
Over the years, the Gullah have attracted study by many [[historian]]s, [[linguist]]s, [[folklorist]]s, and [[anthropologist]]s interested in their rich cultural heritage. Many academic books on that subject have been published. The Gullah have also become a symbol of cultural pride for blacks throughout the United States and a subject of general interest in the media. Numerous newspaper and magazine articles, documentary films, and children's books on Gullah culture, have been produced, in addition to popular novels set in the Gullah region. In 1991 [[Julie Dash]] wrote and directed ''[[Daughters of the Dust]]'', the first feature film about the Gullah, set at the turn of the century on St. Helena Island. Born into a Gullah family, she was the first African-American woman director to produce a feature film.

Gullah people now organize cultural [[festival]]s every year in towns up and down the Lowcountry. [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina|Hilton Head Island]], for instance, hosts a "Gullah Celebration" in February. It includes "De Aarts ob We People" show; the "Ol’ Fashioned Gullah Breakfast"; "National Freedom Day," the "Gullah Film Fest", "A Taste of Gullah" food and entertainment, a "Celebration of Lowcountry Authors and Books," an "Arts, Crafts & Food Expo," and "De Gullah Playhouse". [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]] hosts the oldest and the largest celebration, "The Original Gullah Festival" in May. The nearby Penn Center on [[St. Helena Island, South Carolina|St. Helena Island]] holds "Heritage Days" in November. Other Gullah festivals are celebrated on [[James Island, South Carolina]] and [[Sapelo Island|Sapelo Island, Georgia]].

Gullah culture is also being celebrated elsewhere in the United States. The [[High Art Museum]] in Atlanta has presented exhibits about Gullah culture. The Black Cultural Center at [[Purdue University]] in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]] conducted a research tour, cultural arts festival, and other related events to showcase the Gullah culture. The Black Cultural Center Library maintains a bibliography of Gullah books and materials, as well. [[Metro State College]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] recently hosted a conference on Gullah culture, called ''The Water Brought Us: Gullah History and Culture,'' which featured a panel of Gullah scholars and cultural activists. These events in Indiana and Colorado are typical of the attention Gullah culture regularly receives throughout the United States.

===Cultural survival===
Gullah culture has proven to be particularly resilient. Gullah traditions are strong in the rural areas of the Lowcountry mainland and on the Sea Islands, and among their people in urban areas such as Charleston and Savannah. Gullah people who have left the Lowcountry and moved far away have also preserved traditions; for instance, many Gullah in New York, who went North in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of the first half of the 20th century, have established their own neighborhood churches in [[Harlem]], [[Brooklyn]], and [[Queens]]. Typically they send their children back to rural communities in South Carolina and Georgia during the summer months to live with grandparents, uncles, and aunts. Gullah people living in New York frequently return to the Lowcountry to retire. Second- and third-generation Gullah in New York often maintain many of their traditional customs and sometimes still speak the Gullah language.

The Gullah custom of painting porch ceilings [[haint blue]] to deter haints, or [[ghost]]s, survives in the American South. Having also been adopted by [[White Southerners]], it has lost some of its spiritual significance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theawl.com/2018/01/haint-blue-the-ghost-tricking-color-of-southern-homes-and-gullah-folktales/ |title=Haint Blue, the Ghost-Tricking Color of Southern Homes and Gullah Folktales |first=Katy |last=Kelleher |work=[[The Awl]] |date=January 16, 2018 |access-date=March 5, 2018}}</ref>
