'''Beatrix'''<ref>[https://www.royal-house.nl/members-royal-house/princess-beatrix Members of the Royal House: Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands] - official website of the Royal house of the Netherlands</ref> (Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard, {{IPA-nl|ˈbeːjaːtrɪks ˌʋɪlɦɛlˈminaː ˈʔɑrmɡɑrt|-|Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard, prinses van Oranje-Nassau.ogg}}; born 31 January 1938) is a member of the [[Dutch royal house]] who reigned as [[Queen of the Netherlands]] from 1980 until her abdication in 2013.

Beatrix is the eldest daughter of [[Queen Juliana]] and her husband, [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld]]. Upon her mother's accession in 1948, she became [[heir presumptive]]. Beatrix attended a public primary school in Canada during [[World War II]], and then finished her primary and secondary education in the Netherlands in the post-war period. In 1961, she received her [[law degree]] from [[Leiden University]]. In 1966, Beatrix married [[Claus von Amsberg]], a [[Germans|German]] diplomat, with whom she had three children. When her mother abdicated on 30 April 1980, Beatrix succeeded her as queen.

Beatrix's reign saw the country's [[Netherlands Antilles|Caribbean possessions]] reshaped with [[Aruba]]'s [[Status aparte|secession]] and becoming its own [[Countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|constituent country]] within the kingdom in 1986. This was followed by the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]] in 2010, which created the new [[Caribbean Netherlands|special municipalities]] of [[Bonaire]], [[Sint Eustatius]], and [[Saba]], and the two new constituent countries of [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]].

On [[Koninginnedag]] (''Queen's Day''), 30 April 2013, Beatrix [[abdicated]] in favour of her eldest son, [[Willem-Alexander]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=de Jong|first1=Perro|title=The Netherlands' love and respect for Beatrix|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22356534|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=BBC|date=30 April 2013}}</ref> At the time of her abdication at age 75, Beatrix was the oldest reigning [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|monarch in the country's history]].<ref>Myrtille van Bommel, "[http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/beatrix-oldest-dutch-reigning-monarch Beatrix oldest Dutch reigning monarch] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103110621/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/beatrix-oldest-dutch-reigning-monarch |date=3 November 2013 }}", ''[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]'', 2011.

When Beatrix was one year old, in 1939, her younger sister [[Princess Irene of the Netherlands|Princess Irene]] was born.<ref name="youth"/>

[[World War II]] broke out in the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 ([[Westfeldzug]]). On 13 May, the [[Dutch Royal Family]] evacuated to [[London]], United Kingdom. One month later, Beatrix went to [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada, with her mother Juliana and her sister Irene, while her father Bernhard and maternal grandmother Queen Wilhelmina remained in London.<ref name="youth"/> The family lived at the [[Stornoway (residence)|Stornoway residence]] (now the residence of the [[Leader of the Opposition]] in the Parliament of Canada).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/royalty/ |title=CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=18 January 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-05}}</ref> With bodyguards and ladies in waiting, the family summered at Bigwin Inn on [[Lake of Bays, Ontario]] where four private stone cottages of the resort served as their retreat. While on [[Bigwin Island]], the constitution of the Netherlands was stored in the safe of Bigwin Inn's Rotunda building. Princess Juliana and her family were remembered for their "down to earth" friendliness, general gratefulness and great reverence for their homeland and people, to whom they paid homage by refraining from all luxuries offered to guests at the resort that was once billed as the largest and most luxurious summer resort in Canada. In order to provide them with a greater sense of security, culinary chefs and staff catered to personal orders at meal time. Upon their departure, the hotel musicians of the Bigwin Inn Orchestra assembled dockside; and at every public performance afterward through to the end of World War II, the ''[[Wilhelmus]]'' was played. In the years following the shuttering and neglect of the island resort, the "Juliana" cottages were well maintained and preserved in an informal tribute to Princess Juliana and her family. In thanks for the protection of her and her daughters, Princess Juliana established the custom of the delivery to the Canadian government every spring of tulips, which are the centrepiece of the [[Canadian Tulip Festival]].

On 5 May 1945, the German troops in the Netherlands surrendered. The family returned to the Netherlands on 2 August 1945.

==Education==
[[File:Christmas - queen Juliana and princess Beatrix.jpg|thumb|left|Princess Beatrix and [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Queen Juliana]] in 1960]]
In April 1950, Princess Beatrix entered the Incrementum, a part of Baarnsch Lyceum, where, in 1956, she passed her school graduation examinations in the subjects of arts and classics.<ref name="studies">{{cite web |url=http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/Wie_is_wie/H_M_de_Koningin/Studie |title=Het Koninklijk Huis |publisher=Koninklijkhuis.nl |accessdate=2010-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225032242/http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/Wie_is_wie/H_M_de_Koningin/Studie |archive-date=25 February 2010 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 1954, Beatrix served as bridesmaid at the wedding of Baroness van Randwijck and Mr T Boey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Princess Beatrix Bridesmaid At Wedding|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/princess-beatrix-bridesmaid-at-wedding-of-mr-t-boe/|publisher=British Pathe}}</ref>

On 31 January 1956 Beatrix celebrated her 18th birthday.  From that date, under the Constitution of the Netherlands, she was entitled to assume the [[Royal Prerogative]].  At that time, her mother installed her in the [[Dutch Council of State|Council of State]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/Files/PA-Sessions/June-2002/e_CV_Reine_Beatrix.asp|title=e CV Reine Beatrix|website=www.coe.int|access-date=2017-01-20}}</ref>

The same year her studies at [[Leiden University]]  began. In her first years at the university, she studied [[sociology]], [[jurisprudence]], [[economics]], [[political history|parliamentary history]] and [[constitutional law]].<ref name="studies"/> In the course of her studies she also attended lectures on the cultures of [[Suriname]] and the [[Netherlands Antilles]], the [[Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands]], [[international relations|international affairs]], [[international law]], history and [[Law of the European Union|European law]]

The princess also visited various European and international organisations in [[Geneva]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Paris]], and [[Brussels]].  She was also an active member of the VVSL (Female Union for Students in Leiden), now called L.S.V. Minerva, after merging with the Leidsch Studenten Corps (which before then was male-only). In the summer of 1959, she passed her preliminary examination in law, and she obtained her law degree in July 1961.<ref name="studies"/>

==Political involvement==

[[File:Arron, Beatrix en Ferrier in Suriname 1975.jpg|thumb|[[Henck Arron]], Princess Beatrix, and [[Johan Ferrier]] during the independence ceremony of [[Suriname]] in 1975]]
Her appearance on the political scene was almost immediately marked by controversy. In 1965, Beatrix became engaged to the German aristocrat [[Claus von Amsberg]], a diplomat working for the German Foreign Office. There was a massive protest on their wedding day in [[Amsterdam]] on 10 March 1966. Prince Claus had served in the [[Hitler Youth]] and the [[Wehrmacht]] and was therefore associated by some of the Dutch population with German [[Nazism]]. Protests included such memorable slogans as "''Claus 'raus!''" (Claus out!) and "''Mijn fiets terug''" ("Return my bicycle" – a reference to occupying German soldiers confiscating Dutch bicycles during WWII). A group of [[Provo (movement)|Provo]]s threw a smoke bomb  at the [[Golden Coach (Netherlands)|Golden Coach]], resulting in a violent street battle with the [[Law enforcement in the Netherlands|police]]. But as time went on, Prince Claus became one of the most popular members of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarchy]], and his death in 2002 was widely mourned.

On 25 November 1975, Beatrix and Prince Claus attended the independence ceremony of [[Suriname]], held in the new nation's capital, [[Paramaribo]], representing her mother the Queen.

There was an even more violent riot [[Amsterdam coronation riots|on 30 April 1980]], during Beatrix's [[investiture]] (sovereigns of the Netherlands are not crowned as such). Some people, including [[socialist]] [[squatters]], used the occasion to protest against poor housing conditions in the Netherlands and against the monarchy in general, using the slogan "''Geen woning; geen Kroning''" (No home, no coronation). There were violent clashes with the police and security forces. This event is reflected in contemporary Dutch literature in the books of [[A.F.Th. van der Heijden]].

As monarch, Beatrix had weekly meetings with the prime minister. She signed all new Acts of Parliament and royal decrees, and until a constitutional change late in her reign, appointed the ''[[informateur]]'', an official who is responsible for chairing coalition talks in the formation of new governments. At the state opening of parliament each September, she delivered the Speech from the Throne, in which the government announces its plans for the coming parliamentary year. As queen, she was president of the Council of State. Her role was largely ceremonial and as a focus of national unity; she did not make legislative or executive decisions.

Beatrix is a member of the [[Bilderberg Group]].<ref name=prweb97>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.de/cgi/release?id=42594|title=Bilderberg Meeting of 1997 Assembles|date=13 June 1997|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430211149/http://www.prnewswire.de/cgi/release?id=42594|archive-date=30 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Marriage and children==

On 28 June 1965, the engagement of Princess Beatrix to the German diplomat Claus von Amsberg was announced. Claus and Beatrix had met at the wedding-eve party of Princess Tatjana of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and [[Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse]], in summer 1964. Following the consent of Parliament to the marriage, Claus von Amsberg became a Dutch citizen, and upon his marriage became Prince Claus of the Netherlands, Jonkheer van Amsberg.

Beatrix married Claus von Amsberg on 10 March 1966 in civil and religious ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Video: Wedding of Princess Beatrix and Claus von Amsberg|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaD90D416Wg|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> The bride wore a traditional gown with train in duchesse silk satin, designed by Caroline Bergé-Farwick of Maison Linette, in Den Bosch, and the Württemberg Ornate Pearl Tiara.

The junior bridesmaids were [[Jack Stewart-Clark|Daphne Stewart-Clark]] and Carolijn Alting von Geusau, with page boys Joachim Jencquel and Markus von Oeynhausen-Sierstorpff.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal wedding Beatrix and Claus|url=http://www.angelfire.com/realm/beatrix1966/}}</ref>

The royal couple had three sons:

#Prince [[Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau|Johan Friso]], known as "Friso" (1968–2013)<ref>

They lived at [[Drakensteyn Castle]] in [[Lage Vuursche]] with their children until Beatrix ascended the throne. In 1981, they moved into [[Huis ten Bosch]] Palace in The Hague.

==Reign==
[[File:Vladimir Putin in the Netherlands 1 November 2005-2.jpg|thumb|left|Queen Beatrix and President [[Vladimir Putin]] during his state visit to the Netherlands in 2005]]

On 30 April 1980, Beatrix became the monarch when her mother abdicated. She was [[Inauguration of the Dutch monarch|sworn-in and inaugurated]] as monarch during a joint session of the two chambers of the States General at a ceremony held in the [[Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam|Nieuwe Kerk]] in Amsterdam later that day.

Beatrix's constitutional duties included those typically accorded to a [[head of state]]; this includes having to sign every piece of legislation before it becomes law, formally appointing various officials, receiving and accrediting ambassadors, and awarding honours and medals, among others. Outside of these constitutional duties, her other informal roles included being the highest representative of the kingdom internationally and to be a unifying figure locally.

Beatrix was rarely quoted directly in the press during her reign since the government information service (''Rijksvoorlichtingsdienst'') made it a condition of interviews that she may not be quoted. This policy was introduced shortly after her inauguration, reportedly to protect her from political complications that may arise from "off-the-cuff" remarks. It did not apply to her son [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Prince Willem-Alexander]].

Throughout much of her reign Beatrix had a considerable role in the [[Dutch cabinet formation|cabinet formation process]]; notably she appointed the ''[[formateur#Informateur|informateur]]'', the person who leads the negotiations that ultimately lead to the formation of a government.  However, this was changed in 2012, and now the largest party in the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] appoints a "scout" who then appoints an informateur.

On 1 January 1986, [[Aruba]] seceded from the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and became a separate constituent country in the Dutch Kingdom.

On 6 October 2002, the Queen's husband, [[Prince Claus of the Netherlands|Prince Claus]], died after a long illness. A year and a half later her mother died after long suffering from [[dementia|senile dementia]], while her father succumbed to [[cancer]] in December 2004.

On 8 February 2005, Beatrix received a rare honorary doctorate from [[Leiden University]], an honour the Queen does not usually accept. In her acceptance speech she reflected on the monarchy and her own 25 years as Queen.<ref>[http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/NL/nieuws/nieuws.html?Toespraken/2223.html]

On 29 and 30 April 2005, she celebrated the [[Silver Jubilee|25th anniversary of her reign]].  She was interviewed on Dutch television, was offered a concert on [[Dam Square]] in [[Amsterdam]], and a celebration took place in [[The Hague]], the country's seat of government.

On 31 May 2006 the ''6th Polish Air Assault Brigade'' would receive the ''Militaire Willemsorde der 4e klasse'' in The Hague. Beatrix was to tie the prestigious medal to the standard of the incumbents of the [[1st Independent Parachute Brigade (Poland)|1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chapter 8.

On 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles were [[Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|formally dissolved]]. The [[Caribbean Netherlands|new municipalities]] of [[Bonaire]], [[Sint Eustatius]], and [[Saba]] and the new constituent countries of [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]] were established in its place. The dissolution ceremony in the Netherlands Antilles' capital, [[Willemstad]], was attended by the then-[[House of Orange-Nassau|Prince and Princess of Orange]], [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]] and his wife [[Máxima of the Netherlands|Máxima]], representing the Queen.

===Kissed by a bystander===
During 1988 [[Queen's Day]], Queen Beatrix was kissed by a bystander, later identified as Maarten Rijkers, when she walked through the crowd of people at a flea market in the [[Jordaan]]. When Beatrix walked alongside Rijkers he said "Give me a kiss, girl", after which he gave her a hug and two kisses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onsamsterdam.nl/130-jaar-koninklijk-feest-in-de-hoofdstad|title=Ons Amsterdam &#124; 130 jaar koninklijk feest in de hoofdstad|first=FIZZ Marketing &|last=Communicatie|website=onsamsterdam.nl}}</ref>

Other victims of the crash were critically hurt. One week after the attack, another victim succumbed to the injuries he had sustained. The royal party were unharmed, but the Queen and members of her family saw the crash at close range. Within hours, Beatrix made a rare televised address to express her shock and condolences.

===Abdication===

In a broadcast on national media on 28 January 2013, Beatrix announced her intention to [[abdicate]] on 30 April ([[Koninginnedag|Queen's Day]]), when she would have been on the throne for exactly 33 years. Beatrix stated that it was time to "place the responsibility for the country in the hands of a new generation."<ref name="AlJ-abdicate1">{{cite web | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/01/20131281999888740.html | title=Dutch Queen to abdicate in April for son | publisher=Al Jazeera | date=28 January 2013 | accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref> Her [[heir apparent]] was her eldest son, Prince Willem-Alexander.<ref name="BBCabdicate1" /> She was the third successive Dutch monarch to abdicate, following her grandmother and her mother.<ref name="BBCabdicate1">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21237254 | title=Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands to abdicate for son | work=BBC | date=28 January 2013 | accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref> The broadcast was followed by a statement from Prime Minister [[Mark Rutte]] who paid tribute to Beatrix, saying "Since her [[investiture]] in 1980, she has applied herself heart and soul to Dutch society."<ref name="AlJ-abdicate1" />

The official programme for the abdication and inauguration took place on 30 April 2013. Beatrix signed the instrument of abdication in the Vroedschapkamer (also known as Mozeszaal)<ref>[https://archive.today/20130703143740/http://www.paleisamsterdam.nl/het-paleis/troonswisseling/programma] </ref> in the Royal Palace, Amsterdam at 10:07&nbsp;a.m. local time. With the completion of her signature, she was no longer monarch. The inauguration of Willem-Alexander as king took place that afternoon in the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] in Amsterdam.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time and place of abdication and investiture, 28 January 2013|url=http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/globale-paginas/taalrubrieken/english/news/|publisher=Royal Dutch House}}</ref>

There has been no confirmation of this.<ref>Depictions, text in Dutch [http://www.buitenbeeldinbeeld.nl/Amsterdam_C/borst.htm Retrieved 23 June 2017.]</ref>

Princess Beatrix has held titles throughout her life, as a granddaughter or daughter of a monarch, and eventually as the Sovereign. Beatrix's official title was ''Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, etc., etc., etc''.<ref name="Parlement"/> The triple ''etc.'' refers to the monarch's [[Style of the Dutch sovereign|many dormant titles]]. She signed official documents with only "Beatrix". In common parlance she was referred to as ''The Queen'' (''de koningin'' or ''de vorstin'') or ''Her Majesty'' (Hare Majesteit). But when in conversation with the queen the practice was to initially address her as "Your [[Majesty]]" or in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as "Uwe Majesteit"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/english/content.jsp?objectid=13853|title=The Dutch Royal House; FAQ; "How should I address members of the Royal House?"|accessdate=2008-06-29| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610075751/http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/english/content.jsp?objectid=13853| archive-date = 10 June 2007}}</ref> and thereafter as "Mevrouw" (ma'am).<ref name=stylepref>{{cite news|last=Van den Bor|first=Conny|title=Queen Beatrix – still impeccable after 30 years|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/queen-beatrix-still-impeccable-after-30-years|accessdate=28 January 2013|newspaper=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|date=29 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111185457/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/queen-beatrix-still-impeccable-after-30-years|archive-date=11 November 2013|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Beatrix has received honours and awards from countries around the world, both during her life as a princess and as a monarch. In her capacity as the Sovereign she was Grand Master of the Military Order of William (''Militaire Willemsorde'') and the other Dutch orders of merit. She is a Stranger Lady of the [[Order of the Garter|Most Noble Order of the Garter]] and the 1,187th [[knight|Dame]] of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in [[Spain]], and she has received numerous other medals and decorations.

From birth till her inauguration as queen she had the following name and titles, to which she reverted after her abdication: ''Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, Princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/nieuws/nieuwsberichten/2013/januari/prins-van-oranje-wordt-koning-willem-alexander/ | title=Prins van Oranje wordt Koning Willem-Alexander | publisher=Website of the Royal House | language=nl | date=28 January 2013 | accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>
