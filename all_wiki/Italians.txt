According to [[Antiochus of Syracuse]], the term Italy was used by the Greeks to initially refer only to the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula corresponding to the modern province of [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] and part of the provinces of [[Catanzaro]] and [[Vibo Valentia]] in [[southern Italy]]. Nevertheless, by his time the larger concept of [[Oenotria]] and "Italy" had become synonymous and the name also applied to most of [[Lucania]] as well. According to [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'', before the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]], the name was used by Greeks to indicate the land between the [[strait of Messina]] and the line connecting the [[gulf of Salerno]] and [[gulf of Taranto]], corresponding roughly to the current region of [[Calabria]]. The Greeks gradually came to apply the name "Italia" to a larger region<ref>Pallottino, M., ''History of Earliest Italy'', trans. Ryle, M & Soper, K. in Jerome Lectures, Seventeenth Series, p. 50</ref> In addition to the "Greek Italy" in the south, historians have suggested the existence of an "Etruscan Italy" covering variable areas of central Italy.<ref>Giovanni Brizzi, Roma. Potere e identità: dalle origini alla nascita dell'impero cristiano, Bologna, Patron, 2012 p. 94</ref>

The borders of Roman Italy are better established. Cato's ''[[Origines]]'', the first work of [[history]] composed in [[Latin]], described Italy as the entire peninsula south of the [[Alps]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSY-DwAAQBAJ&q=cato+italy+south+of+the+Alps&pg=PT49 |title = The "Birth" of Italy: The Institutionalization of Italy as a Region, 3rd-1st Century BCE|isbn = 9783110544787|last1 = Carlà-Uhink|first1 = Filippo|date = 25 September 2017}}</ref> According to Cato and several Roman authors, the Alps formed the "walls of Italy".<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLsRDAAAQBAJ&q=cato+walls+of+Italy&pg=PA108 |title = Livy on the Hannibalic War|isbn = 9780198152958|last1 = Levene|first1 = D.

The Latin term ''Italicus'' was used to describe "a man of Italy" as opposed to a [[Roman province|provincial]].  For example, [[Pliny the Elder]] notably wrote in a letter ''Italicus es an provincialis''? meaning "are you an Italian or a provincial?".<ref>''Letters'' 9.23</ref>
The adjective ''italianus'', from which are derived the Italian (and also French and English) name of the Italians, is [[Middle Latin|medieval]] and was used alternatively with Italicus during the [[early modern period]].<ref>''ytaliiens'' (1265) [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/italien TLFi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029191636/http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/italien |date=2018-10-29 }}</ref>

[[File:RomanItaly.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Expansion of the territory known as [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]] from the establishment of the [[Roman Republic]] until [[Diocletian]].]]
The Italian peninsula was divided into a multitude of tribal or ethnic territory prior to the [[Roman expansion in Italy|Roman conquest of Italy]] in the 3rd century BC. After a series of wars between [[Greeks]] and [[Etruscans]], the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], with [[Rome]] as their capital, gained the ascendancy by 272 BC, and completed the conquest of the Italian peninsula by 218 BC.

This period of unification was followed by one of conquest in the Mediterranean, beginning with the [[First Punic War]] against [[Carthage]]. In the course of the century-long struggle against Carthage, the Romans conquered Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica. Finally, in 146 BC, at the conclusion of the [[Third Punic War]], with Carthage completely destroyed and its inhabitants enslaved, Rome became the dominant power in the Mediterranean.

The process of Italian unification, and the associated [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], culminated in 88 BC, when, in the aftermath of the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]], Rome granted [[socii|its fellow Italian allies]] full rights in [[Roman society]], extending [[Roman citizenship]] to all fellow [[Italic peoples]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Keaveney |first=Arthur |year=1987 |title=Rome and the Unification of Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojoOAAAAQAAJ |location=London |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=9781904675372 |access-date=2018-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711052218/https://books.google.com/books?id=ojoOAAAAQAAJ |archive-date=2019-07-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>

From its inception, Rome was a republican city-state, but four famous civil conflicts destroyed the [[Roman Republic]]: [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] against [[Gaius Marius]] and his son (88–82 BC), [[Julius Caesar]] against [[Pompey]] (49–45 BC), [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] against [[Mark Antony]] and Octavian (43 BC), and Mark Antony against [[Augustus|Octavian]].

Octavian, the final victor (31 BC), was accorded the title of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and thereby became the first Roman Emperor. Augustus created for the first time an administrative region called ''Italia'' with inhabitants called "Italicus populus", stretching from the [[Alps]] to Sicily: for this reason historians like [[Emilio Gentile]] called him ''Father of Italians''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.domainmarket.com/buynow/lagrandebiblioteca.com|title=LaGrandeBiblioteca.com is available at DomainMarket.com|website=LaGrandeBiblioteca.com is available at DomainMarket.com|access-date=2020-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202081144/https://www.domainmarket.com/buynow/lagrandebiblioteca.com|archive-date=2020-02-02|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1st century BC, ''Italia'' was still a collection of territories with different political statuses. Some cities, called ''[[municipium|municipia]]'', had some independence from Rome, while others, the ''[[Colonia (Roman)|coloniae]]'', were founded by the Romans themselves. Around 7 BC, [[Augustus]] divided Italy into eleven ''regiones''.

During the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], the [[Roman Empire]] nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasions, military anarchy and civil wars, and hyperinflation. In 284, emperor [[Diocletian]] restored political stability. The importance of Rome declined, because the city was far from the troubled frontiers. The seats of the Caesars became [[Augusta Treverorum]] (on the River [[Rhine]] frontier) for [[Constantius Chlorus]] and [[Sirmium]] (on the River [[Danube]] frontier) for [[Galerius]], who also resided at [[Thessaloniki]]. Under Diocletian, Italy became the ''Dioecesis Italiciana'', subdivided into thirteen provinces, now including [[Raetia]].

Under [[Constantine the Great]], Italy became the [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy]] (''praefectura praetoria Italiae''), and was subdivided into two dioceses. ''Diocesis Italia annonaria'' (Italy of the [[Cura Annonae|annona]], governed from Milan) and ''Diocesis Italia Suburbicaria'' (Italy "under the government of the ''[[wikt:urbs|urbs]]''", i.e. governed from Rome). [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christianity]] became the Roman state religion in AD 380, under emperor [[Theodosius I]].

The last Western emperor, [[Romulus Augustulus]], was deposed in 476 by a Germanic foederati general in Italy, [[Odoacer]]. His defeat marked the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and the end of the political unification of Italy until the establishment of the modern Kingdom of Italy in 1861.

[[File:Italy 1454 after the Peace of Lodi.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Italy after the [[Peace of Lodi]] in 1454.]]
Odoacer ruled well for 13 years after gaining control of Italy in 476. Then he was attacked and defeated by [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], the king of another Germanic tribe, the [[Ostrogoths]]. Theodoric and Odoacer ruled jointly until 493, when Theodoric murdered Odoacer. Theodoric continued to rule Italy with an army of Ostrogoths and a government that was mostly Italian. After the death of Theodoric in 526, the kingdom began to grow weak. By 553, emperor [[Justinian I]] expelled the Ostrogoths, and Italy was included into the [[Byzantine Empire under the Justinian dynasty]].

Byzantine rule in Italy collapsed by 572 as a result of invasions by another Germanic tribe, the [[Lombards]]. The peninsula was now dominated by the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]], with minor remnants of Byzantine control, especially in the south.

During the 5th and 6th centuries, the popes increased their influence in both religious and political matters in Italy. It was usually the popes who led attempts to protect Italy from invasion or to soften foreign rule. For about 200 years the popes opposed attempts by the Lombards, who had captured most of Italy, to take over Rome as well. The [[pope]]s finally defeated the Lombards with the aid of two Frankish kings, [[Pepin the Short]] and [[Charlemagne]]. Using land won for them by Pepin in 756, the popes established political rule in what were called the [[Papal States]] in central Italy.

The Lombards remained a threat to papal power, however, until they were crushed by Charlemagne in 774. Charlemagne added the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] to his vast realm. In recognition of Charlemagne's power, and to cement the church's alliance with him, Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Romans by [[Pope Leo III]] in 800.<ref>{{cite book

Louis divided the empire among his sons, and Frankish Italy became part of [[Middle Francia]], extending as far south as [[Rome]] and [[Spoleto]]. This [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] became part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the 10th century,  while southern Italy was under the rule of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Principality of Benevento]] or of the [[Byzantine Empire]], in the 12th century absorbed into the [[Kingdom of Sicily]].

===Rise of the city-states and the Renaissance===
{{see|Italian city-states|Italian language#Origins}}
From the 11th century on, Italian cities began to grow rapidly in independence and importance. They became centres of political life, [[banking]], and foreign trade. Some became wealthy, and many, including [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Genoa]], [[Milan]], [[Pisa]], [[Siena]] and [[Venice]], grew into nearly independent city-states. Each had its own foreign policy and political life. They all resisted the efforts of noblemen and emperors to control them.

The emergence of identifiable [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italian dialects]] from [[Vulgar Latin]], and as such the possibility of a specifically "Italian" ethnic identity, has no clear-cut date, but began in roughly the 12th century. Modern standard Italian derives from the written vernacular of [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] writers of the 12th century. The recognition of Italian vernaculars as literary languages in their own right began with ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', an essay written by [[Dante Alighieri]] at the beginning of the 14th century.

During the 14th and 15th centuries, some Italian city-states ranked among the most important powers of Europe. Venice, in particular, had become a major maritime power, and the city-states as a group acted as a conduit for goods from the Byzantine and Islamic empires. In this capacity, they provided great impetus to the developing [[Renaissance]], began in Florence in the 14th century,<ref name="Burke1998">{{cite book|author=Peter Burke|title=The European Renaissance: Centers and Peripheries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWKnnbajUUQC|year=1998|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-19845-1|access-date=2015-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430005436/https://books.google.com/books?id=WWKnnbajUUQC|archive-date=2016-04-30|url-status=live}}</ref> and led to an unparalleled flourishing of the arts, literature, music, and science.

However, the city-states were often troubled by violent disagreements among their citizens. The most famous division was between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]. The Guelphs supported supreme rule by the pope, and the Ghibellines favoured the emperor. City-states often took sides and waged war against each other. During the Renaissance, Italy became an even more attractive prize to foreign conquerors. After some city-states asked for outside help in settling disputes with their neighbours, King [[Charles VIII of France]] marched into Italy in 1494; he soon withdrew, showing that the Italian peninsula's delicate equilibrium could be taken advantage of. After the [[Italian Wars]], Spain emerged as the dominant force in the region. Venice, Milan, and other city-states retained at least some of their former greatness during this period, as did [[Savoy]]-Piedmont, protected by the Alps and well defended by its vigorous rulers.

===The French Revolution and Napoleon===
{{Main|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy}}
[[File:Laura bassi1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Laura Bassi]], the first chairwoman of a university in a scientific field of studies]]
The French Revolution and Napoleon influenced Italy more deeply than they affected any other outside country of Europe. The [[French Revolution]] began in 1789 and immediately found supporters among the Italian people. The local Italian rulers, sensing danger in their own country, drew closer to the European kings who opposed France. After the French king was overthrown and France became a republic, secret clubs favouring an Italian republic were formed throughout Italy. The armies of the French Republic began to move across Europe. In 1796, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] led a French army into northern Italy and drove out the Austrian rulers. Once again, Italy was the scene of battle between the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] and the French. Wherever France conquered, Italian republics were set up, with constitutions and legal reforms. Napoleon made himself emperor in 1804, and part of northern and central Italy was unified under the name of the Kingdom of Italy, with Napoleon as king. The rest of northern and central Italy was annexed by France. Only Sicily, where [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|the Bourbon king]] had taken refuge upon the French invasion of Naples, and the island of Sardinia, which had been ceded to the Alpine [[House of Savoy]] in 1720 and had remained under their rule ever since, were not under French control.

French domination lasted less than 20 years, and it differed from previous foreign control of the Italian peninsula. In spite of heavy taxation and frequent harshness, the French introduced representative assemblies and new laws that were the same for all parts of the country. For the first time since the days of ancient Rome, Italians of different regions used the same money and served in the same army. Many Italians began to see the possibility of a united Italy free of foreign control.

===The Kingdom of Italy===
{{Main|Kingdom of Italy}}
[[File:Partenza da Quarto.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The [[Expedition of the Thousand]].]]

After the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the reaction set in with the [[Congress of Vienna]] allowed the restoration of many of the old rulers and systems under Austrian domination. The concept of nationalism continued strong, however, and sporadic outbreaks led by such inveterate reformers as [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] occurred in several parts of the peninsula down to 1848–49. This ''[[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]'' movement was brought to a successful conclusion under the guidance of [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour]], prime minister of Piedmont.

Cavour managed to unite most of Italy under the headship of [[Victor Emmanuel II]] of the house of Savoy, and on 17 March 1861, the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed with Victor Emmanuel II as king. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], the popular republican hero of Italy, contributed much to this achievement and to the subsequent incorporation of the Papal States under the Italian monarch. Italian troops occupied Rome in 1870, and in July 1871, this formally became the capital of the kingdom. [[Pope Pius IX]], a longtime rival of Italian kings, stated he had been made a "prisoner" inside the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] walls and refused to cooperate with the royal administration. Only in 1929 did the Roman Pope accept the unified Italy with [[Rome]] as capital.

[[World War I]] has been interpreted as completing the process of Italian unification, with the annexation of Trieste, [[Istria]], [[Trentino-Alto Adige]] and [[Zadar|Zara]]. After World War I, Italy emerged as one of the [[Big Four (World War I)|four great powers]] after the victory of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].

In the decades following unification, Italy began creating colonies in [[Africa]], and under [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Fascist Italy (1922-1943)|fascist regime]] conquered [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], founding the [[Italian Empire]] in 1936. The population of Italy grew to 45 millions in 1940 and the economy, which had been based upon agriculture until that time, started its industrial development, mainly in northern Italy. But [[World War II]] soon destroyed Italy and its colonial power.

===The Italian Republic===
{{Main|History of the Italian Republic}}

Between 1945 and 1948, the outlines of a new Italy began to appear. [[Victor Emmanuel III]] gave up the throne on 9 May 1946, and his son, [[Umberto II]], became king. On 2 June Italy held its first free election after 20 years of Fascist rule (the so-called ''Ventennio''). Italians chose a republic to replace the monarchy, which had been closely associated with [[Fascism]]. They elected a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] to prepare a new democratic constitution. The Assembly approved the constitution in 1947, which came into force on 1 January 1948.

From the Magna Graecia period to the 17th century, the inhabitants of the Italian peninsula were at the forefront of [[Western culture]], being the fulcrum and origin of [[Magna Graecia]], [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Humanism]], the [[Renaissance]], the [[Scientific Revolution]], the [[Counter-Reformation]], [[Baroque]], and [[Neoclassicism]].

Italy also became a seat of great formal learning in 1088 with the establishment of the [[University of Bologna]], the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|first university]] in the Western World.<ref>{{cite book

Italy continued its leading cultural role through the [[Baroque]] period and into the Romantic period, when its dominance in painting and sculpture diminished but the Italians re-established a strong presence in music.

Italian explorers and navigators in the 15th and 16th centuries left a perennial mark on human history with the modern "discovery of America", due to [[Christopher Columbus]]. In addition, the name of the [[Americas|American continents]] derives from the geographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s first name. Also noted, is explorer [[Marco Polo]] who travelled extensively throughout the [[eastern world]] recording his travels.

Due to comparatively late national unification, and the historical autonomy of the regions that comprise the Italian peninsula, many traditions and customs of the Italians can be identified by their regions of origin. Despite the political and social isolation of these regions, Italy's contributions to the cultural and historical heritage of the Western world remain immense. Famous elements of Italian culture are its [[opera]] and music, its iconic gastronomy and food, which are commonly regarded as amongst the most popular in the world,<ref>{{cite book

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Italian philosophy}}

[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]], the founder of modern political science and ethics.|alt=]]Over the ages, [[Italian literature]] had a vast influence on Western philosophy, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, and going onto Renaissance, [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]] and modern philosophy.
Italian Medieval philosophy was mainly Christian, and included several important philosophers and theologians such as St [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Aquinas was the student of [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a brilliant [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] experimentalist, much like the [[Franciscans|Franciscan]], [[Roger Bacon]] of [[Oxford]] in the 13th century. Aquinas reintroduced [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] to Christianity. He believed that there was no contradiction between faith and secular reason. He believed that Aristotle had achieved the pinnacle in the human striving for truth and thus adopted Aristotle's philosophy as a framework in constructing his theological and philosophical outlook. He was a professor at the prestigious [[University of Paris]].

Italy was also affected by the Enlightenment, a movement which was a consequence of the [[Renaissance]] and changed the road of Italian philosophy.<ref name="history-world.org">{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/enlightenment_throughout_europe.htm|title=The Enlightenment throughout Europe|website=history-world.org|access-date=12 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123082708/http://history-world.org/enlightenment_throughout_europe.htm|archive-date=23 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Followers of the group often met to discuss in private salons and coffeehouses, notably in the cities of [[Milan]], Rome and [[Venice]]. Cities with important universities such as [[Padua]], [[Bologna]] and [[Naples]], however, also remained great centres of scholarship and the intellect, with several philosophers such as [[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) (who is widely regarded as being the founder of modern Italian philosophy)<ref name="maritain.nd.edu">{{cite web|url=http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/hop70.htm|title=History of Philosophy 70|website=maritain.nd.edu|access-date=12 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525033238/http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/hop70.htm|archive-date=25 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Antonio Genovesi]].<ref name="history-world.org" /> Italian society also dramatically changed during the Enlightenment, with rulers such as [[Leopold II of Tuscany]] abolishing the death penalty. The church's power was significantly reduced, and it was a period of great thought and invention, with scientists such as [[Alessandro Volta]] and [[Luigi Galvani]] discovering new things and greatly contributing to Western science.<ref name="history-world.org" /> [[Cesare Beccaria]] was also one of the greatest Italian Enlightenment writers and is now considered one of the fathers of [[Classical school (criminology)|classical criminal theory]] as well as modern [[penology]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hostettler|first=John|title=Cesare Beccaria: The Genius of 'On Crimes and Punishments'|date=2011|publisher=Waterside Press|location=Hampshire|isbn=978-1904380634|page=160}}</ref> Beccaria is famous for his masterpiece ''[[On Crimes and Punishments]]'' (1764), a treatise (later translated into 22 languages) that served as one of the earliest prominent condemnations of [[torture]] and the [[death penalty]] and thus a landmark work in [[anti-death penalty]] philosophy.<ref name="history-world.org" />

Some of the most prominent philosophies and ideologies in Italy during the late 19th and 20th centuries include [[anarchism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[futurism]], [[fascism]], and [[Christian democracy]]. Both futurism and fascism (in its original form, now often distinguished as [[Italian fascism]]) were developed in Italy at this time. From the 1920s to the 1940s, Italian Fascism was the official philosophy and ideology of the Italian government led by Benito Mussolini. [[Giovanni Gentile]] was one of the most significant 20th-century Idealist/Fascist philosophers. Meanwhile, anarchism, communism, and socialism, though not originating in Italy, took significant hold in Italy during the early 20th century, with the country producing numerous significant [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]], socialists, and communists. In addition, [[anarcho-communism]] first fully formed into its modern strain within the Italian section of the [[First International]].<ref name="Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111-113">Nunzio Pernicone, ''Italian Anarchism 1864–1892'', pp. 111–113, AK Press 2009.</ref> [[Antonio Gramsci]] remains an important philosopher within [[Marxist]] and communist theory, credited with creating the theory of [[cultural hegemony]].

==Literature==
{{Main|Italian literature}}

Italian literature may be unearthed back to the [[Middle Ages]], with the most significant poets of the period being [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Petrarch]], and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]. During the [[Renaissance]], humanists such as [[Leonardo Bruni]], [[Coluccio Salutati]] and [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] were great collectors of antique manuscripts. Many worked for the organized Church and were in holy orders (like Petrarch), while others were lawyers and chancellors of Italian cities, like Petrarch's disciple, Salutati, the Chancellor of Florence, and thus had access to book copying workshops.

One of the most remarkable poets of the early 19th and 20th century writers was [[Giacomo Leopardi]], who is widely acknowledged to be one of the most radical and challenging thinkers of the 19th century.<ref>[https://newrepublic.com/article/115276/giacomo-leopardis-zibaldone-reviewed-adam-kirsch The Least Known Masterpiece of European Literature] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822050017/https://newrepublic.com/article/115276/giacomo-leopardis-zibaldone-reviewed-adam-kirsch |date=2017-08-22 }}, New Republic</ref><ref>[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/leopardi/projects/index.aspx The Zibaldone project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523011333/http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/leopardi/projects/index.aspx |date=2015-05-23 }}, University of Birmingham</ref> [[Italo Svevo]], the author of ''La coscienza di Zeno'' (1923), and [[Luigi Pirandello]] (winner of the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature), who explored the shifting nature of reality in his prose fiction and such plays as ''Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore'' (''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'', 1921). [[Federigo Tozzi]] and [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] were well-known novelists, critically appreciated only in recent years, and regarded one of the forerunners of [[existentialism]] in the European novel.

==Law and justice==
Since the Roman Empire, most western contributions to Western legal culture was the emergence of a class of Roman jurists. During the Middle Ages, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the most influential western scholar of the period, integrated the theory of natural law with the notion of an eternal and biblical law.<ref>Code of [[Canon Law]], Can. 252, §&nbsp;3 [https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PW.HTM] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200219191727/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PW.HTM |date=2020-02-19 }}</ref> During the Renaissance, Prof. [[Alberico Gentili]], the founder of the science of international law, authored the first treatise on public international law and separated secular law from canon law and Roman Catholic theology.

==Science and technology==
{{Main|Science and technology in Italy|List of Italian inventions}}

Italians have been the central figures of countless inventions and discoveries and they made many predominant contributions to various fields. During the [[Renaissance]], Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–72) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include the invention of the thermometer and key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]]. Other astronomers such as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625–1712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835–1910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]].

Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901–54), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that built the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]. He and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]], including [[Emilio G. Segrè]] (1905–89) (who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]),<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 27757806|title = Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the "New Tasks" of Physics in Italy|journal = Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences|volume = 29|issue = 1|pages = 141–181|last1 = Orlando|first1 = Lucia|year = 1998|doi = 10.2307/27757806}}</ref> and [[Bruno Rossi]] (1905–93), a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy.

==Mathematics==
During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Leonardo Fibonacci]], the greatest Western mathematician of the Middle Ages, introduced the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] to the [[Western world]]. He also introduced the sequence of [[Fibonacci number]]s, which he used as an example in ''[[Liber Abaci]]''. [[Gerolamo Cardano]] established the foundation of [[probability]] and introduced the [[binomial coefficients]] and the [[binomial theorem]]; he also invented several mechanical devices. During the Renaissance, [[Luca Pacioli]] introduced [[accounting]] to the world, publishing the first work on [[Double-entry bookkeeping system]]. [[Galileo Galilei]] made several significant advances in mathematics. [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]]'s works partially anticipated [[integral calculus]] and popularized [[logarithms]] in Italy.

[[Jacopo Riccati]], who was also a jurist, invented the [[Riccati equation]]. [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]], the first woman to write a mathematics handbook, become the first woman mathematics professor at a university. [[Gian Francesco Malfatti]], posed the problem of carving three circular columns out of a triangular block of marble, using as much of the marble as possible, and conjectured that three mutually-tangent circles inscribed within the triangle would provide the optimal solution, which are now known as [[Malfatti circles]]. [[Paolo Ruffini]] is credited for his innovative work in mathematics, creating [[Ruffini's rule]] and co-creating the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who was one of the most influential mathematicians of his time, made essential contributions to [[analysis]], [[number theory]], and both [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[celestial mechanics]].

[[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] invented [[tensor calculus]] and [[absolute differential calculus]], which were popularized in a work he co-wrote with [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], and used in the development of the [[theory of relativity]]; Ricci-Curbastro also wrote meaningful works on algebra, infinitesimal analysis, and papers on the theory of [[real number]]s.<ref>{{citation | title=Lezioni di Analisi algebrica ed infinitesimale | last=Ricci-Curbastro | first=Gregorio | publisher=Padova: Tip.

[[Beniamino Segre]] is one of the major contributors to [[algebraic geometry]] and one of the founders of [[finite geometry]]. [[Ennio de Giorgi]], a [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] recipient in 1990, solved [[Bernstein's problem]] about [[minimal surface]]s and the [[Hilbert's nineteenth problem|19th Hilbert problem]] on the regularity of solutions of [[elliptic partial differential equations]].

From [[Italian folk music|folk music]] to [[European classical music|classical]], music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, and many of the prevailing classical music forms, such as the [[symphony]], concerto, and [[sonata]], can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music.
Italians invented many of the musical instruments, including the piano and violin.

Most notable Italians composers include the [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], the [[List of Baroque composers|Baroque composers]] [[Alessandro Scarlatti|Scarlatti]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], the [[List of Classical era composers|Classical composers]] [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], and the [[List of Romantic-era composers|Romantic composers]] [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], whose operas, including ''[[La bohème]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', and ''[[Turandot]]'', are among the most frequently worldwide performed in the [[List of important operas|standard repertoire]].<ref>{{cite web

La Scala operahouse in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world. Famous Italian opera singers include [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Alessandro Bonci]].

Introduced in the early 1920s, [[jazz]] took a particularly strong foothold among Italians, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centres of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the [[progressive rock]] movement of the 1970s, with bands like [[Premiata Forneria Marconi|PFM]] and [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]]. Italy was also an important country in the development of [[disco]] and [[electronic music]], with [[Italo disco]], known for its futuristic sound and prominent usage of synthesizers and [[drum machine]]s, being one of the earliest electronic dance genres, as well as European forms of disco aside from [[Euro disco]] (which later went on to influence several genres such as [[Eurodance]] and [[Nu-disco]]).

Producers and songwriters such as [[Giorgio Moroder]], who won three [[Academy Award]]s for his music, were highly influential in the development of [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] (electronic dance music). Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the [[Sanremo Music Festival]], which served as inspiration for the [[Eurovision]] song contest, and the [[Festival of Two Worlds]] in [[Spoleto]]. Singers such as [[traditional pop|pop]] [[diva]] [[Mina (Italian singer)|Mina]], classical crossover artist [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Grammy]] winner [[Laura Pausini]], and European chart-topper [[Eros Ramazzotti]] have attained international acclaim.

Italians have a long tradition in sport.
In numerous sports, both individual and team, Italy has been very successful.

[[Football in Italy|Association football]] is the most popular sport in Italy.
[[Italian national football team|Italy]] is one of the most successful national teams in association football having four [[FIFA World Cup]]s, one UEFA European Championship and one Olympic tournament.
Amongst the players who won the FIFA World Cup there are [[Giuseppe Meazza]], [[Silvio Piola]] (to date the highest goalscorer in Italian first league history), [[Dino Zoff]], [[Paolo Rossi]], [[Marco Tardelli]], [[Bruno Conti]], [[Gianluigi Buffon]], [[Fabio Cannavaro]], [[Alessandro Del Piero]], [[Andrea Pirlo]] and [[Francesco Totti]].
Amongst those who did not win the World Cup but laureated as European champions are [[Gianni Rivera]], [[Luigi Riva]] (to date Italy's leading scorer of all time), [[Sandro Salvadore]], [[Giacomo Bulgarelli]], [[Pietro Anastasi]] and [[Giacinto Facchetti]].
Other prominent players who achieved success at club level are [[Giampiero Boniperti]], [[Romeo Benetti]], [[Roberto Boninsegna]], [[Roberto Bettega]], [[Roberto Baggio]] and [[Paolo Maldini]].
Of the above-mentioned, the goalkeeper Dino Zoff, who served in the National team from 1968 to 1983, is to date the only Italian player to have won both the European championship (in 1968) and the FIFA World Cup (in 1982), apart from being the oldest winner ever of the World Cup.
At club level, to date Italy has won a total of 12 European Cup / Champions' Leagues, 9 [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cups / UEFA Europa League]] and 7 [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]].

Motorcycle racers such as [[Giacomo Agostini]] and [[Valentino Rossi]] are recognized as some of the greatest sportstars of all time. [[Federica Pellegrini]], one of the few female swimmers to have set world records in more than one event has been one of the world's most successful swimmers. Italian athletes have won 549 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]], and another 114 medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. [[Jessica Rossi]] scored a [[Shooting sport]] world record of 75 in the qualification and a world record of 99. As for Olympic games, 663 Italians won medals, particularly in [[Swordsmanship]], which makes them the 6th most successful ethnic group in Olympic history. There are more than 2,000,000 Italian skiers in the world, most of them in the north and in the centre.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} Italian skiers received good results in the Winter Olympic Games, World Cup, and World Championships.

Italians are the second of the most who have won the [[World Cycling Championship]] more than any other country after [[Belgium]]. The [[Giro d'Italia]] is a world-famous long-distance cycling race held every May, and constitutes one of the three [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]], along with the [[Tour de France]] and the [[Vuelta a España]], each of which last approximately three weeks.
[[Tennis]] has a significant following near courts and on television. Italian professional tennis players are almost always in the top 100 world ranking of male and female players. [[Beach tennis#Beach tennis with paddle racquet|Beach tennis with paddle racquet]] was invented by Italians, and is practised by many people across the country.
[[Volleyball]] is played by a lot of amateur players and professional players compete in the [[Italian Volleyball League]], regarded as the best and most difficult volleyball league in the world. The [[Italy national volleyball team|male]] and [[Italy women's national volleyball team|female]] national teams are often in the top 4 ranking of teams in the world.
[[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] is a popular sport for Italians, as the Italian World and Olympic champions are very celebrated people.
In [[wrestling]], one of the most remarkable wrestlers is [[Bruno Sammartino]], who held the record of the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWWF (World) Heavyweight Championship]] for over 11 years across two reigns, the first of which is the longest single reign in the promotion's history.

[[Rugby union]] was imported from France in the 1910s and has been regularly played since the 1920s; the [[Italy national rugby union team|National team]] has progressed slowly but significantly during the decades and thanks to the good results achieved in the second half of the 1990s, when they managed to beat historical teams like [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] and eventually [[France national rugby union team|France]], Italy gained the admission to the Five Nation Championship, later renamed [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]]; Italy has taken part to the [[Rugby World Cup]] since its inauguration in 1987 and never missed an edition though to date has never gone past the group stage.

===Ancient history===
The earliest [[Human|modern humans]] inhabiting Italy are believed to have been [[Paleolithic]] peoples that may have arrived in the [[Italian Peninsula]] as early as 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. Italy is believed to have been a major Ice-age refuge from which Paleolithic humans later colonized Europe.

The [[Neolithic]] colonization of Europe from [[Western Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] beginning around 10,000 years ago reached Italy, as most of the rest of the continent although, according to the [[demic diffusion]] model, its impact was most in the southern and eastern regions of the European continent.<ref name=pmid15044595>{{cite journal

John Murray: printed by Spottiswoode and Co., New-Street Square and Parliament Streetp. 661</ref>—would go on to [[Roman conquest of Italy|conquer the whole Italian peninsula]]. During the Roman period hundreds of cities and colonies were established throughout Italy, including [[Florence]], [[Turin]], [[Como]], [[Pavia]], [[Padua]], [[Verona]], [[Vicenza]], [[Trieste]] and many others. Initially many of these cities were colonized by Latins, but later also included colonists belonging to the other Italic tribes who had become Latinized and joined to Rome. After the Roman conquest of Italy "the whole of Italy had become Latinized".<ref>M. Rostovtzeff, ''A History of the Ancient World: Rome'', Vol. II, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1927, p. 171</ref>

After the [[Cisalpine Gaul#Gallic expansion and Roman conquest|Roman conquest of Cisalpine Gaul]] and the widespread confiscations of Gallic territory, much of the Gaulish population was killed or expelled.<ref>Alfred S.

These colonies included [[Bologna]], [[Modena]], [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Parma]], [[Piacenza]], [[Cremona]] and [[Forlì]]. According to [[Strabo]]:
<blockquote>"The greater part of the country used to be occupied by the Boii, Ligures, Senones, and [[Gaesatae]]; but since the Boii have been driven out, and since both the Gaesatae and the Senones have been annihilated, only the Ligurian tribes and the Roman colonies are left."<ref name="Strabo, 5.1.10" /></blockquote>
The [[Boii]], the most powerful and numerous of the Gallic tribes, were expelled by the Romans after 191 BC and settled in [[Bohemia]].<ref>Strabo, 5.213.</ref>

Following Roman rule, Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia were conquered by the [[Vandals]], then by the Ostrogoths, and finally by the Byzantines. At one point, Sardinia grew increasingly autonomous from the Byzantine rule to the point of organizing itself into [[Sardinian medieval kingdoms|four sovereign Kingdoms]], known as "Judicates", that would last until the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] conquest in the 15th century. Corsica came under the influence of the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] and later under the maritime Republics of [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]. In 687, Sicily became the Byzantine [[Sicily (theme)|Theme of Sicily]]; during the course of the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]], Sicily gradually became the [[Emirate of Sicily]] (831–1072). Later, a series of conflicts with the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Normans]] would bring about the establishment of the [[County of Sicily]], and eventually the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. The [[Lombards of Sicily]] (not to be confused with the ''Longobards''), coming from [[Northern Italy]], settled in the central and eastern part of Sicily. After the marriage between the Norman [[Roger I of Sicily]] and [[Adelaide del Vasto]], descendant of the [[Aleramici]] family, many Northern Italian colonisers (known collectively as ''Lombards'') left their homeland, in the Aleramici's possessions in [[Piedmont]] and [[Liguria]] (then known as ''Lombardy''), to settle on the island of Sicily.<ref name="books.google.it">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IBspuVRwnUC&pg=PA323|title=Following the marriage to his third wife, Adelaide, from the Aleramici clan in Piedmont, many northern Italians (the sources refer to them as lombardi, as opposed to the longobardi from southern Italy) settled on the island of Sicily from the late Eleventh century onwards.|author1=G.

==Italian surnames==
Most of [[Italian name#Surnames|Italy's surnames]] (''cognomi''), with the exception of a few areas marked by linguistic minorities, derive from Italian and arose from an individual's peculiar qualities (e.g. ''Rossi'', ''Bianchi'', ''Quattrocchi'', ''Mancini'', etc.), occupation (''Ferrari'', ''Auditore'', ''Sartori'', ''Tagliabue'', etc.), relation of fatherhood or lack thereof (''De Pretis'', ''Orfanelli'', ''Esposito'', ''Trovato'', etc.), and geographic location (''[[Padova]]no'', ''[[Pisa]]no'', ''[[Lecce|Leccese]]'', ''[[Lucca|Lucchese]]'', etc.). Some of them also indicate a remote foreign origin (''[[Greeks|Greco]]'', ''[[Germans|Tedesco]]'', ''[[Moors|Moro]]'', ''[[Albanians|Albanese]]'', etc.).

Italy after its unification did not seek nationalism but instead sought work.<ref name=":0" /> However, a unified state did not automatically constitute a sound economy. The global economic expansion, ranging from Britain's [[Industrial Revolution]] in the late 18th and through mid 19th century, to the use of slave labor in the Americas did not hit Italy until much later (with the exception of the "industrial triangle" between [[Milan]], [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]])<ref name=":0" />  This lag resulted in a deficit of work available in Italy and the need to look for work elsewhere. The mass industrialization and urbanization globally resulted in higher labor mobility and the need for Italians to stay anchored to the land for economic support declined.<ref name=":1" />

Moreover, better opportunities for work were not the only incentive to move; family played a major role and the dispersion of Italians globally.  Italians were more likely to migrate to countries where they had family established beforehand.<ref name=":1" /> These ties are shown to be stronger in many cases than the monetary incentive for migration, taking into account a familial base and possibly an Italian migrant community, greater connections to find opportunities for work, housing etc.<ref name=":1" /> Thus, thousands of Italian men and women left Italy and dispersed around the world and this trend only increased as the First World War approached.

Notably, it was not as if Italians had never migrated before; internal migration between North and Southern Italy before unification was common. Northern Italy caught on to industrialization sooner than Southern Italy, therefore it was considered more modern technologically, and tended to be inhabited by the bourgeoisie.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=The View from Vesuvius Italian Culture and the Southern Question How did Southern Italy Become "The South"?|url=https://archive.org/details/viewfromvesuvius00moen|url-access=limited|last=Moe|first=Nelson|publisher=University of California Press|year=2002|pages=[https://archive.org/details/viewfromvesuvius00moen/page/n17 1]–9}}</ref> Alternatively, rural and agro-intensive Southern Italy was seen as economically backward and was mainly populated by lower class peasantry.<ref name=":2" /> Given these disparities, prior to unification (and arguably after) the two sections of Italy, North and South were essentially seen by Italians and other nations as separate countries. So, migrating from one part of Italy to next could be seen as though they were indeed migrating to another country or even continent.<ref name=":2" />

Furthermore, large-scale migrations phenomena did not recede until the late 1920s, well into the Fascist regime, and a subsequent wave can be observed after the end of the [[Second World War]]. Another wave is currently happening due to the ongoing [[Italian government debt|debt crisis]].

Over 80 million people of full or part Italian descent live outside Europe, with over 60 million living in [[South America]] (mostly in [[Brazil]], which has the largest number of Italian descendants outside Italy,<ref name=Brazil /> and [[Argentina]], where over 62.5% of the population have at least one Italian ancestor),<ref name=Matanza /> 20 million living in North America ([[United States]] and [[Canada]]) and 1 million in Oceania ([[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]). Others live in other parts of Europe (primarily the [[Italians in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Italians in Germany|Germany]], [[Italians in France|France]] and [[Italians in Switzerland|Switzerland]]). Most Italian citizens living abroad live in other nations of the European Union. A historical Italian community has also existed in [[History of the Genoese in Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] since the 16th century. To a lesser extent, people of full or partial Italian descent are also found in Africa (most notably in the former Italian colonies of [[Italian Eritreans|Eritrea]], which has 100,000 descendants,<ref name="ambberlino.esteri.it">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ambberlino.esteri.it/Ambasciata_Asmara/Menu/Ambasciata/News/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218200229/http://www.ambberlino.esteri.it/Ambasciata_Asmara/Menu/Ambasciata/News/ |archive-date=2012-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Italian Somalis|Somalia]], [[Italian Libyans|Libya]], [[Italians of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]], and in others countries such as [[Italian South Africans|South Africa]], with 77,400 descendants,<ref name="Italian-World"/> [[Italian Tunisians|Tunisia]] and [[Italian Egyptians|Egypt]]), in the Middle East (in recent years the [[Italians in the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]] has maintained a desirable destination for Italian immigrants, with currently 10,000 Italian immigrants), and Asia ([[Singapore]] is home to a sizeable Italian community).<ref name="ambberlino.esteri.it"/><ref name="Italian-World"/>

Regarding the diaspora, there are many individuals of Italian descent who are possibly eligible for Italian citizenship by method of jus sanguinis, which is from the Latin meaning "by blood." However, just having Italian ancestry is not enough to qualify for Italian citizenship. To qualify, one must have at least one Italian-born citizen ancestor who, after emigrating from Italy to another country, had passed citizenship onto their children before they naturalized as citizens of their newly adopted country. The Italian government does not have a rule regarding on how many generations born outside of Italy can claim Italian nationality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://conssanfrancisco.esteri.it/consolato_sanfrancisco/en/i_servizi/per_i_cittadini/cittadinanza/citizenship-by-descent.html|title=Citizenship by descent|website=conssanfrancisco.esteri.it|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015042247/https://conssanfrancisco.esteri.it/consolato_sanfrancisco/en/i_servizi/per_i_cittadini/cittadinanza/citizenship-by-descent.html|archive-date=2018-10-15|url-status=live}}</ref>

In both the Slovenian and Croatian portions of [[Istria]], in Dalmatia as well as in the city of [[Rijeka]], Italian refers to autochthonous speakers of Italian and various [[Italo-Dalmatian languages]], natives in the region since before the inception of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]]. In the aftermath of the [[Istrian exodus]] following the Second World War, most Italian-speakers are today predominantly located in the west and south of Istria, and number about 30,000.<ref>{{cite web

In the first Austrian census carried out in 1870 the number of Italian Dalmatians varied between 40,000 and 50,000 amongst the about 250,000 inhabitants of [[Dalmatia]], or 20% of the total Dalmatian population.<ref>{{cite book

In the French [[County of Nice]], autochthonous speakers of regional languages of Italy ([[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] and [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]]), are natives in the region since before annexation to France in 1860. The number of inhabitants with Italian ancestry is generally indeterminable, and the use of [[French language]] is now ubiquitous. In addition, Corsica was a part of the [[Republic of Genoa]] until 1768 and most of the islanders still have a certain level of proficiency of [[Corsican language|Corsican]], a language of the Italo-Dalmatian family closely related to [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]. The Italian language ceased to have official status in Corsica in 1859<ref>Abalain, Hervé, (2007) ''Le français et les langues historiques de la France'', Éditions Jean-Paul Gisserot, pp.113</ref> when it was supplanted by French and a process of de-Italianization was started by the French government in Corsica (and in 1861 the [[Nizzardo Italians|Nizzardo area]]).

A similar process happened in [[Malta]], where the [[Maltese Italians]] have practically disappeared in the last two centuries after Britain took control of the island during [[Napoleon]] times. However, the Italian language is today spoken and understood by 66% of the population.<ref>{{cite web |title=Europeans and their Languages |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf |website=European Commission |publisher=Special Eurobarometer |access-date=25 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414102658/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf |archive-date=14 April 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Swiss Italian is spoken as natively by about 350,000 people in the canton of [[Ticino]] and in the [[Italian Graubünden|southern part of Graubünden]] (Canton Grigioni). Swiss-Italian also refers to the Italian speaking population in this region (southern Switzerland) close to the border with [[Italy]]. Swiss Italian dialects are spoken in emigrant communities around the world, including in [[Swiss Italians of Australia|Australia]].
