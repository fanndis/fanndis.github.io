==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->
Dory, the [[Paracanthurus|regal blue tang]], gets separated from her parents, Jenny and Charlie, as a child. As she grows up, Dory attempts to search for them, but gradually forgets them due to her short-term memory loss. Later, she joins Marlin the [[clownfish]], looking for Nemo.

One year after meeting Marlin and Nemo, Dory is living with them on their reef. One day, Dory has a [[flashback (psychology)|flashback]] and remembers her parents. She decides to look for them, but her memory problem is an obstacle. She suddenly remembers that they lived at the "Jewel of [[Morro Bay, California]]" across the ocean when Nemo mentions the name.

Marlin and Nemo accompany Dory on her journey. With the help of Crush, their [[sea turtle]] friend, they ride the [[California Current]] to California. Upon arrival, they explore a shipwreck full of lost cargo, where Dory accidentally awakens a giant [[Humboldt squid]], who pursues them and almost devours Nemo. They manage to trap the squid in a large shipping container, and Marlin berates Dory for endangering them. Her feelings hurt, Dory travels to the surface to seek help where she is captured by staff members from the trio's nearby destination, the Marine Life Institute.

Dory is placed in quarantine and tagged. There she meets a grouchy but well-meaning seven-legged [[octopus]] named Hank. Dory's tag marks her for transfer to an aquarium in [[Cleveland]]. Hank, who fears being released back into the ocean, agrees to help Dory find her parents in exchange for her tag. In one exhibit, Dory encounters her childhood friend Destiny, a nearsighted [[whale shark]], who used to communicate with Dory through pipes, and Bailey, a [[beluga whale]], who mistakenly believes he has lost his ability to [[animal echolocation|echolocate]]. Dory subsequently has flashbacks of life with her parents, and struggles to recall details. She finally remembers how she was separated from her parents: she overheard her mother crying one night, left to retrieve a shell to cheer her up, and was pulled away by an [[Undertow (water waves)|undertow current]] out into the ocean.

Marlin and Nemo attempt to rescue Dory. With the help of two lazy [[California sea lion]]s named Fluke and Rudder and a [[common loon]] named Becky, they manage to get into the institute and find her in the pipe system. Other blue tangs tell them that Dory's parents escaped from the institute a long time ago to search for her and never came back, leaving Dory to believe that they have died. Hank retrieves Dory from the tank, accidentally leaving Marlin and Nemo behind. He is then apprehended by one of the employees and unintentionally drops Dory into the drain, flushing her out to the ocean. While wandering aimlessly, she comes across a trail of shells; remembering that when she was young, her parents had set out a similar trail to help her find her way back home, she follows it. At the end of the trail, Dory finds an empty [[brain coral]] with multiple shell trails leading to it. As she turns to leave, her parents arrive. They tell her they spent years laying down the trails for her to follow in the hopes that she would eventually find them.

Marlin, Nemo, and Hank end up in the truck taking various aquatic creatures to Cleveland. Destiny and Bailey escape from their exhibit to help Dory rescue them. Once on board the truck, Dory persuades Hank to return to the sea with her, and together, they hijack the truck and drive it over busy highways, creating havoc, before crashing it into the sea, freeing all the fish. Dory, along with her parents and new friends, return to the reef with Marlin and Nemo.

In a [[post-credits scene]], the Tank Gang (from ''Finding Nemo''), still trapped inside their (now covered in [[algae]]) plastic bags, reach California one year after floating across the [[Pacific Ocean]], where they are picked up by staff members from the Marine Life Institute.

In July 2012, it was reported that [[Andrew Stanton]] was developing a sequel to ''Finding Nemo'',<ref name="sequel">{{cite magazine |url = https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/john-carter-helmer-andrew-stanton-dives-back-into-animation-with-finding-nemo-sequel |title = 'John Carter' Helmer Andrew Stanton Dives Back into Animation With 'Finding Nemo' Sequel |magazine = Deadline.com |accessdate = July 18, 2012 }}</ref> with Victoria Strouse writing the script and a release date scheduled for 2016.<ref name="FN2">{{cite news |last = Kit |first = Borys |title = Andrew Stanton to Direct Pixar's 'Finding Nemo' Sequel |url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/andrew-stanton-pixar-finding-nemo-sequel-350267 |accessdate = July 17, 2012 |newspaper = The Hollywood Reporter |date = July 17, 2012 }}</ref> However, the same day the news of a potential sequel broke, Stanton posted a message on his personal Twitter calling into question the accuracy of these reports.

Nothing to see here now. #skyisnotfalling."<ref>{{cite web |last = Stanton |first = Andrew |title = @andrewstanton |url = https://twitter.com/andrewstanton/status/225380771039420416 |publisher = Twitter |accessdate = August 23, 2012 }}</ref> According to a report by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' published in August 2012, [[Ellen DeGeneres]] was in negotiations to reprise her role of Dory.<ref>{{cite news |last = Rose |first = Lacey |title = Ellen DeGeneres in Talks to Return for 'Finding Nemo' Sequel (Exclusive) |url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ellen-degeneres-finding-nemo-sequal-pixar-364553 |accessdate = August 22, 2012 |newspaper = The Hollywood Reporter |date = August 21, 2012 }}</ref> In September 2012, it was confirmed by Stanton, saying: "What was immediately on the list was writing a second ''[[John Carter (film)|Carter]]'' movie. When that went away, everything slid up. I know I'll be accused by more sarcastic people that it's a reaction to ''Carter'' not doing well, but only in its timing, but not in its conceit."<ref>{{cite news |last = Keegan |first = Rebecca |title = Director Andrew Stanton looks back on 'John Carter's' rocky path |url = https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-john-carter-director-20120908,0,4090564,full.story |accessdate = September 8, 2012 |newspaper = Los Angeles Times |date = September 8, 2012 }}</ref> In February 2013, it was confirmed by the press that [[Albert Brooks]] would reprise the role of Marlin in the sequel.<ref>{{cite news |last = Fleming Jr. |first = Mike |title = Albert Brooks Hooks Deal To Reprise In 'Finding Nemo 2′ |url = https://www.deadline.com/2013/02/albert-brooks-hooks-deal-to-reprise-in-finding-nemo-2/ |accessdate = February 12, 2013 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date = February 12, 2013 }}</ref>

In April 2013, Disney announced the sequel, ''Finding Dory'', for November 25, 2015, confirming that DeGeneres and Brooks would be reprising their roles as Dory and Marlin, respectively.<ref name=THRDory2015 /> Following a long campaign for a sequel on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', DeGeneres stated:

In a July 2013 interview with ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Stanton spoke of the sequel's origin: "There was polite inquiry from Disney [about a ''Finding Nemo'' sequel]. I was always 'No sequels, no sequels.' But I had to get on board from a [[Vice president|VP]] standpoint. [Sequels] are part of the necessity of our staying afloat, but we don't want to have to go there for those reasons. We want to go there creatively, so we said [to Disney], 'Can you give us the timeline about when we release them? Because we'd like to release something we actually want to make, and we might not come up with it the year you want it.{{'"}}<ref>{{cite news |last = Keegan |first = Rebecca |title = With 'Despicable Me 2' and more, movies revisit the sequel debate |url = https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-ca-despicable-me-2-sequels-20130707,0,6099932,full.story |accessdate = August 7, 2013 |newspaper = Los Angeles Times |date = July 5, 2013 }}</ref>

In a 2016 interview Stanton stated how the film's story came to be; "I don't watch my films that often after they're done because I have to watch them so many times before they come out. So about 2010 when we were getting ''Finding Nemo'' ready for the 10-year re-release in 3D, it was interesting to watch again after all that time. Something kind of got lodged in the back of my brain and started to sort of stew. I started to think about how easily Dory could get lost and not find Marlin and Nemo again. She basically was in the same state that she was when Marlin found her. I didn't know where she was from. I knew that she had spent most of her youth wandering the ocean alone, and I wanted to know that she could find her new family, if she ever got lost again. It's almost like the parental side of me was worried." Stanton additionally stated: "I knew if I ever said ''Finding Dory'' or mentioned a sequel to ''Finding Nemo'' out loud, I'd be done, [T]here would be no way I'd be able to put that horse back in the barn. So I kept it very quiet until I knew I had a story that I thought would hold, and that was in early 2012. So I pitched it to [[John Lasseter]] and he was all into it. Then I got a writer, and once we had a treatment that we kind of liked, I felt comfortable calling Ellen."<ref>{{cite web |last = Draskovic |first = Marina |title = Director Andrew Stanton Brings Dory Back |url = https://d23.com/director-andrew-stanton-brings-dory-back/ |publisher = D23.com |accessdate = June 17, 2016 |date = June 17, 2016 }}</ref>

[[File:Angus-maclane Buscando a Dory premiere.jpg|thumb|upright|Co-director Angus MacLane at a ''Finding Dory'' premiere]]

Stanton selected Victoria Strouse to write the screenplay. She later said, "It was always collaborative with Andrew, but really the screenwriting was me. Of course, Andrew would do passes, and he and I would brainstorm a lot together and then we would bring it to the group of story artists. People would weigh in and share ideas."<ref name="McKittrick">{{cite web |last = McKittrick |first = Christopher |title = Writing in Slow Motion: Finding Dory |url = http://creativescreenwriting.com/finding-dory/ |publisher = Creative Screenwriting |accessdate = June 26, 2016 |date = June 22, 2016 }}</ref> She pointed to Dory's forgetfulness as a challenge when writing the script, adding, "You don't realize until you sit down to write a character who can't remember things how integral memory is to absolutely everything we do, and that's what creates a narrative that people can follow. When a main character can't self-reflect and can't tell a story, that character is very difficult to design because she can't really lead. To get her to be able to lead and to get an audience to be able to trust her was the hardest thing to do."<ref name="McKittrick"/>

The fictional Marine Life Institute depicted extensively in the film is based on the production team's research trips to the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]], [[the Marine Mammal Center]] and the [[Vancouver Aquarium]].<ref name="Eagan">{{cite news|last1=Eagan|first1=Daniel|title=Ocean Odyssey: Andrew Stanton explores the backstory of Pixar's Dory|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/features/finding-dory-pixar-andrew-stanton-interview|accessdate=September 26, 2016|work=Film Journal International|publisher=Mediabistro Holdings|date=June 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106191813/http://www.filmjournal.com/features/finding-dory-pixar-andrew-stanton-interview|archive-date=November 6, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The film's ending was revised after Pixar executives viewed ''[[Blackfish (film)|Blackfish]]'', a 2013 documentary film which focuses on the dangers of keeping [[Killer whale|orca whales]] in captivity.

[[Angus MacLane]] was one of the first people to whom Stanton revealed his idea for the sequel. Together, with [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]], they discussed about different ideas for places Dory would visit during her journey — one of those ideas was the touch pool sequence. Later, during the ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'' (2012) wrap party, Stanton invited Angus to join him in his first co-directing duty. Stanton described Angus' role as a "jack of all trades", particularly utilizing his experience in animation and story, as well as in production, having created a few short films himself.<ref name="SFWhatCoDirectorDoes">{{cite web|last1=Sciretta|first1=Peter|title=What A Co-Director Does on a Pixar Movie?
