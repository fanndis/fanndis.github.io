==Career==

===1975–1982: Early work===
[[File:Michael Keaton by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|Michael Keaton in at the 2013 [[San Diego]] Comic Con International]]
Keaton first appeared on TV in the Pittsburgh public television programs ''Where the Heart Is'' and ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' (1975). For '' Mister Rogers'' he played one of the "Flying Zookeeni Brothers"<ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=view_from_the_bay/arts_entertainment&id=6080015 "Keaton offers advice to young actors"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521102347/http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=view_from_the_bay%2Farts_entertainment&id=6080015 |date=May 21, 2011 }}, ABC.com.

Keaton also worked as an actor in [[Theatre in Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh theatre]]; he played the role of Rick in the Pittsburgh premiere of [[David Rabe]]'s ''[[Sticks and Bones]]'' with the Pittsburgh Poor Players.<ref>{{cite book|last=Conner|first=Lynne|year=2007|title=Pittsburgh In Stages: Two Hundred Years of Theater |publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh Press]]|page=178|isbn=978-0822943303}}</ref> He also performed stand-up comedy during his early years in order to supplement his income.<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/flashback-michael-keaton-tries-and-mostly-fails-to-do-stand-up-in-1980-174561/</ref>

Keaton left Pittsburgh and moved to Los Angeles to begin auditioning for various TV parts. He popped up in various popular TV shows including ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' and ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Hour]]''. He decided to use a [[stage name]] to satisfy [[Screen Actors Guild|SAG]] rules, as there was already an actor ([[Michael Douglas]]) and daytime host ([[Mike Douglas]]) with the same or similar names.  In response to questions as to whether he selected his new surname due to an attraction to actress [[Diane Keaton]], or in [[homage (arts)|homage]] to silent film actor [[Buster Keaton]], he has responded by saying "it had nothing to do with that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8157339/qa-batman-beetlejuice-star-michael-keaton-mister-rogers-fly-fishing-roles-turned-more.|title=Dinner With Daniel: Michael Keaton|first=Daniel|last=Kellison |publisher=grantland.com|accessdate=July 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdfkV4-5oWo&t=5m12s Michael Keaton's Real Name Was Taken By Another Movie Star], The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, uploaded June 27, 2017 (LSSC YouTube channel)<br><Quote><br>Keaton: "I don't know.

His next big break was working alongside [[Jim Belushi]] in the short-lived comedy series ''[[Working Stiffs (TV series)|Working Stiffs]]'', which showcased his comedic talent and led to a co-starring role in the comedy ''[[Night Shift (1982 film)|Night Shift]]'' directed by [[Ron Howard]]. This was his breakout role as the fast-talking schemer Bill "Blaze" Blazejowski earned Keaton some critical acclaim.

===1983–1988: Stardom as a comic lead===
''Night Shift'' led to Keaton becoming a leading man  in the landmark comedy hit ''[[Mr. Mom]]'', which was met with universal acclaim. Keaton was pigeonholed as a comic lead during this time with films like ''[[Johnny Dangerously]]'', ''[[Gung Ho (film)|Gung Ho]]'', [[The Squeeze (1987 film)|''The Squeeze'']], [[The Dream Team (1989 film)|''The Dream Team'']], though Keaton tried to transition to dramatic leads as early as 1984, playing a hockey player in [[Touch and Go (1986 film)|''Touch and Go'']], which was shelved until 1986. [[Woody Allen]] cast Keaton as the lead in ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' the following year, but after filming began Allen felt Keaton was "too modern" and reshot his scenes with [[Jeff Daniels]] in the final film, further delaying his transition to drama in the public eye. When ''Touch and Go'' was finally released in 1986 the studio was still unsure of how to market the film, making the poster similar to ''Mr. Mom'', which resulted in failure at the box office.

1988 was the seminal year in Keaton's career where landed two major unconventional roles, forever changing his image to audiences. He played the title character in [[Tim Burton]]'s horror-comedy ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', earning Keaton widespread acclaim and boosting him to Hollywood's A list. That same year, he also gave an acclaimed dramatic performance as a drug-addicted realtor in [[Glenn Gordon Caron]]'s ''[[Clean and Sober]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===1989–1999: International fame===
Keaton's career was given another major boost when he was again cast by Tim Burton, this time as the title comic book [[superhero]] of 1989's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/features/empire-classic-feature-batman|title=The Making of Batman|date=August 1989|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>Nancy Griffin; Kim Masters (1997).

According to [[Les Daniels]]'s reference book ''Batman: The Complete History'', Keaton was not surprised when he was first considered as Batman as he initially believed the film would be similar to the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|television series]] starring [[Adam West]]. It was only after he was introduced to [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s comic book miniseries, ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', that Keaton really understood the dark and brooding side of Batman that he portrayed to much fan approval.<ref>Les Daniels (2000).

However, when Burton was dropped as director of the film, Keaton left the franchise as well. He was reportedly dissatisfied with the screenplay approved by the new director, [[Joel Schumacher]]. According to the [[A&E Network|A&E]] ''[[Biography (television program)|Biography]]'' episode on Keaton, after he had refused the first time (after meetings with Schumacher), Warner Bros. offered him $15 million, but Keaton steadfastly refused and was replaced by [[Val Kilmer]] in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995).<ref name=Russo>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308195,00.html|title=''Batman 3''|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=October 1, 1993|accessdate=August 16, 2008}}</ref>

Keaton remained active during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films, including ''[[Pacific Heights (1990 film)|Pacific Heights]]'', ''[[One Good Cop]]'', ''[[My Life (film)|My Life]]'' and the star-studded Shakespearean story ''[[Much Ado About Nothing (1993 film)|Much Ado About Nothing]]''. He starred in ''[[The Paper (film)|The Paper]]'' and ''[[Multiplicity (film)|Multiplicity]]'', and twice in the same role, that of [[Elmore Leonard]] character Agent Ray Nicolette, in the films ''[[Jackie Brown]]'' and ''[[Out of Sight]]''.
