'''Pennsylvania Avenue''' is a diagonal street in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] that connects the [[White House]] and the [[United States Capitol]] and then crosses the city to Maryland. In Maryland it is also [[Maryland Route 4]] (MD 4) to [[Maryland Route 717|MD 717]] in [[Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Upper Marlboro]], where it becomes Stephanie Roper Highway.  The section between the White House and Congress is called "America's Main Street";<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/paav Pennsylvania Avenue, National Historic Site]. National Park Service.</ref> it is the location of official parades and processions, as well as protest marches. Moreover, Pennsylvania Avenue is an important commuter road and is part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]].<ref name="Agencies1995">{{cite book|author=United States.

The avenue runs for {{convert|5.8|mi|km}} inside Washington, but the {{convert|1.2|mi|km}} of Pennsylvania Avenue from the [[White House]] to the [[United States Capitol]] building is considered the most important.  It continues within the city for {{convert|3.5|mi|km}}, from the southeast corner of the Capitol grounds through the [[Capitol Hill]] neighborhood, and over the [[Anacostia River]] on the [[John Philip Sousa Bridge]]. Crossing most of [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], it ends {{convert|9.5|mi|km}} from the DC line at the junction with MD 717 in [[Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Upper Marlboro]], where the name changes to the Stephanie Roper Highway, for a total length of {{convert|15.3|mi|km}}. Stephanie Roper Highway used to be Pennsylvania Avenue, but was renamed in 2012.  In addition to its [[street name]]s, in Maryland it is designated as [[Maryland Route 4]]. At one point in the mid-20th century, Pennsylvania Avenue was designated '''DC 4''', an extension of Maryland Route 4 that reached at least the east side of the [[White House]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Northwest of the White House, Pennsylvania Avenue runs for {{convert|1.4|mi|km}} to its end at [[M Street (Washington, D.C.)|M Street NW]] in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], just beyond the [[Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge]] over [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]]. From 1862 to 1962, [[Washington streetcars|streetcars]] ran the length of the avenue from Georgetown to the Anacostia River.

[[File:U.S. Capitol and Pennsylvania Avenue before 1814.tif|thumb|left|Drawing of Pennsylvania Avenue and the Capitol before it was burned down in 1814]]
[[File:11th & Pennsylvania Avenue, NW - Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|Intersection of 11th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW in 1921]]
Although Pennsylvania Avenue extends six miles (10&nbsp;km) within Washington, D.C., the expanse between the White House and the Capitol constitutes the ceremonial heart of the nation. Washington called this stretch "most magnificent & most convenient"{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

Laid out by [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]], Pennsylvania Avenue was one of the earliest streets constructed in the Federal City.<ref>L'Enfant identified himself as "Peter Charles L'Enfant" during most of his life, while residing in the United States.  He wrote this name on his [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3850.ct000512 "Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States ...."] (Washington, D.C.) and on other legal documents. However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, "Pierre Charles L'Enfant". (Reference: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). ''Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic.'' George Washington University, Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|978-0-9727611-0-9}}). The [[United States Code]] states in {{USC|40|3309}}: "(a) In General.&mdash;The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant." The [[National Park Service]] identifies L'Enfant as "[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm#washington Major Peter Charles L'Enfant]" and as "[http://www.nps.gov/history/Nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]" on its website.</ref>  The first reference to the street as ''Pennsylvania Avenue'' comes in a 1791 letter from [[Thomas Jefferson]]. One theory is that the street was named for [[Pennsylvania]] as consolation for moving the capital from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].<ref name="register">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/travel/wash/dc41.htm |publisher=National Park Service |work=Washington, DC: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |title=Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site and Old Post Office Building |accessdate=2009-01-21 }}</ref> Both Jefferson and [[George Washington]] considered the avenue an important feature of the new capital. After inspecting [[L'Enfant Plan|L'Enfant's plan]], President Washington referred to the thoroughfare as a "Grand Avenue".{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Jefferson concurred, and while the "grand avenue" was little more than a wide dirt road ridiculed as "The Great Serbonian Bog", he planted it with rows of fast-growing [[Black Poplar|Lombardy poplars]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

At one time Pennsylvania Avenue provided an unobstructed view between the White House and the Capitol. The construction of an expansion to the Treasury Building blocked this view, and supposedly President [[Andrew Jackson]] did this on purpose. Relations between the president and Congress were strained, and Jackson did not want to see the Capitol out his window,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/About-Treasury/Pages/building.aspx |title= FAQs: Main Treasury Building | publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]}}</ref> though in reality the Treasury Building was simply built on what was cheap government land.

In an effort to tame dust and dirt, Pennsylvania Avenue was first paved using the [[macadam]] method in 1832, but over the years other pavement methods were trialed on the avenue: [[cobblestone]]s in 1849 followed by [[sett (paving)|Belgian blocks]] and then, in 1871, wooden blocks. In 1876, as part of an initiative begun by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to see Washington City's streets improved, Pennsylvania Avenue was paved with [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]] by Civil War veteran [[William Averell]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.civilwarprofiles.com/william-averell-paves-the-way-to-the-white-house-literally/ | title = William Averell Paves the Way to the White House, Literally | accessdate = 2013-12-19 | last = Lively | first = Mathew W. | date = 2013-04-08 | work = Civil War Profiles}}</ref> using [[Pitch Lake|Trinidad lake asphalt]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = McNichol | first1 = Dan | title = Paving the Way: Asphalt in America | chapter = Chapter 4: Asphalting the Avenues | publisher = National Asphalt Pavement Association | year = 2005 | location = Lanham, Maryland | pages = 38â€“55 | isbn = 0-914313-04-5}}</ref>

In 1959, Pennsylvania Avenue was extended from the DC line to Dower House Road.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rowland |first1=James B. |title=6 Miles of New Road to Beaches Opened |work=The Evening Star |date=1 December 1959}}</ref>

On September 30, 1965, portions of the avenue and surrounding area were designated the [[Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site]]. The [[National Park Service]] administers this area which includes the [[United States Navy Memorial]], [[Old Post Office Building (Washington, D.C.)|Old Post Office Tower]], and [[Pershing Park]].<ref name="register" /> Congress created the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC) on October 27, 1972 to rehabilitate the street between the Capitol and the White House, an area seen as blighted. The new organization was given the mandate of developing Pennsylvania Avenue "in a manner suitable to its ceremonial, physical, and historic relationship to the legislative and executive branches of the Federal Government".<ref name="register"/>

In 2010, the District of Columbia designated Pennsylvania Avenue from the southwestern terminus of [[John Philip Sousa Bridge]] to the Maryland state line to be a "D.C. Great Street". The city spent $430 million to beautify the street and improve the roadway.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thomson|first=Robert|title=Patience Required for Travelers on Pennsylvania Avenue|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 30, 2010}}</ref>

=== Parades and protests ===
Ever since an impromptu procession formed around Jefferson's second inauguration, every United States president except [[Ronald Reagan]] has paraded down the Avenue after taking the [[oath of office]] (Reagan paraded up the avenue for his first inauguration, in 1981, but not for the second in 1985 because freezing temperatures and high winds made it dangerous). From [[William Henry Harrison]] to [[Gerald Ford]], the funeral corteges of seven of the eight presidents who died in office and two former presidents followed this route. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] was the only president who died in office whose cortege did not follow this route. [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and Ford were the former presidents whose funeral cortege followed this route. For LBJ, it was along the route from the Capitol to the National City Christian Church, where he worshiped often, because the funeral was held there. Ford's went up Pennsylvania Avenue because it paused at the White House en route to the [[Washington National Cathedral]], where the funeral was held. [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s funeral cortege solemnly proceeded along Pennsylvania Avenue in 1865; only weeks later the end of the [[American Civil War]] was celebrated when the [[Army of the Potomac]] [[parade]]d more joyously along the avenue.

[[File:Pennsylvania Ave - Old Post Office to the Capitol at Night.jpg|thumb|Looking southeast down Pennsylvania Avenue towards the [[Old Post Office Pavilion]] and [[United States Capitol]].]]
As well as being the scene of official functions, Pennsylvania Avenue is the traditional parade and [[protest]] route of ordinary citizens. During the depression of the 1890s, for example, [[Jacob Coxey]] marched 500 supporters down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol to demand federal aid for the unemployed. Similarly, on the eve of [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s 1913 inauguration, [[Alice Paul]] masterminded a parade, the [[Woman Suffrage Procession]], highlighting the [[women's suffrage]] movement. In July 1932, a contingent of the [[Bonus Expeditionary Force]] carried flags up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House where they planned to form picket lines. Pennsylvania Avenue also has served as a background for more lighthearted celebrations, including a series of day- and nighttime [[Shriner]]'s parades in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Thomas (activist)|Thomas]] and [[Concepcion Picciotto]] are the founders of the [[White House Peace Vigil]], the longest running [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] peace [[vigil]] in the US, at [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]] on the 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue.<ref>[http://aje.me/HHwQcE The Oracles of Pennsylvania Avenue] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710053132/http://aje.me/HHwQcE |date=2012-07-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/07/AR2009020701843.html|title=From Lafayette Square Lookout, He Made His War Protest Permanent|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 8, 2009|author=[[Colman McCarthy]]}}</ref>

===Enaction of security measures===
[[File:Marching towards the Capital - September 15, 2007.jpg|thumb|Protesters marching down Pennsylvania Avenue during the [[September 15, 2007 anti-war protest]].]]
After the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in 1995, the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] closed the portion of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House to all vehicular traffic.  Pedestrian and [[bicycle]] traffic, however, was still permitted on the sidewalk.  After [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] this policy was made permanent.  Near the White House traffic is redirected to [[H Street]] or [[Constitution Avenue]], both of which eventually link back with Pennsylvania Avenue. Plans drafted by District officials after the September 11th attacks call for Pennsylvania Avenue downtown to be used as a dividing line for any mass evacuation of the city.  People north of the avenue would be directed north while those south of the avenue would be directed south.  No vehicles would be allowed to cross the avenue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 2002, the [[National Capital Planning Commission]] invited several prominent landscape architects to submit proposals for the redesign of Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House, with the intention that the security measures would be woven into an overall plan for the precinct and a more welcoming public space might be created.  The winning entry by [[Michael Van Valkenburgh]] Associates, Inc., Landscape Architects proposed a very simple approach to planting, paving and the integration of security measures.  Construction was completed in 2004.<ref>{{cite news |work=Washington Post |title=America's Main Street Revisited; Pennsylvania Ave. Reopened to Pedestrians |first= Manny |last=Fernandez |date=November 10, 2004 |page=A01 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/733273771.html?dids=733273771:733273771&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+10%2C+2004&author=Manny+Fernandez&pub=The+Washington+Post&edition=&startpage=A.01&desc=America%27s+Main+Street+Revisited%3B+Pennsylvania+Ave.+Reopened+to+Pedestrians}}</ref>
