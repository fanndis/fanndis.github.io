'''Universal healthcare''' (also called '''universal health coverage''', '''universal coverage''', or '''universal care''') is a [[health care]] system in which all residents of a particular country or region are assured access to health care. It is generally organized around providing either all residents or only those who cannot afford on their own, with either health services or the means to acquire them, with the end goal of improving health outcomes.<ref name="WHO 2010">{{cite book|author=World Health Organization|date=November 22, 2010|title=The world health report: health systems financing: the path to universal coverage|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-4-156402-1|url=https://www.who.int/whr/2010/en/|accessdate=April 11, 2012}}</ref>

Universal healthcare does not imply coverage for all cases and for all people – only that all people have access to healthcare. Some universal healthcare systems are government-funded, while others are based on a requirement that all citizens purchase private health insurance.

==History==
The first move towards a national health insurance system was launched in [[Germany]] in 1883, with the Sickness Insurance Law. Industrial employers were mandated to provide injury and illness insurance for their low-wage workers, and the system was funded and administered by employees and employers through "sick funds", which were drawn from deductions in workers' wages and from employers' contributions. Named after Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, this social health insurance model, launched in Germany in 1883, was the first form of universal care in modern times<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Butticè|first=Claudio|url=https://products.abc-clio.com/abc-cliocorporate/product.aspx?pc=A5958C|title=Universal Health Care|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2019|isbn=978-1-4408-6844-3|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=20, 25}}</ref>. Other countries soon began to follow suit. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] provided coverage for primary care (but not specialist or hospital care) for wage earners, covering about one-third of the population. The [[Russian Empire]] established a similar system in 1912, and other industrialized countries began following suit. By the 1930s, similar systems existed in virtually all of Western and Central Europe. [[Japan]] introduced an employee health insurance law in 1927, expanding further upon it in 1935 and 1940. Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the [[Soviet Union]] established a fully public and centralized health care system in 1920.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rowland |first=Diane |last2=Telyukov |first2=Alexandre V. |date=Fall 1991 |title=Soviet Healthcare From Two Perspectives |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/10/3/71.full.pdf |journal=Health Affairs |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=71–86 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.10.3.71 |pmid=1748393 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=OECD Reviews of Health Systems OECD Reviews of Health Systems: Russian Federation 2012 |pages=38}}</ref> However, it was not a truly universal system at that point, as rural residents were not covered.

==Funding models==
{{see also|Health care economics}}
Universal health care in most countries has been achieved by a mixed model of funding. General [[taxation]] revenue is the primary source of funding, but in many countries it is supplemented by specific charge (which may be charged to the individual or an employer) or with the option of private payments (by direct or optional insurance) for services beyond those covered by the public system. Almost all European systems are financed through a mix of public and private contributions.<ref name="Bentes 2004">{{cite web|last1=Bentes|first1=Margarida|last2=Dias|first2=Carlos Matias|last3=Sakellarides|first3=Sakellarides|last4=Bankauskaite|first4=Vaida|year=2004|title=Health care systems in transition: Portugal|location=Copenhagen|publisher=WHO Regional Office for Europe on behalf of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e82937.pdf|accessdate=August 30, 2006}}</ref> Most universal health care systems are funded primarily by [[tax revenue]] (as in [[Portugal]],<ref name="Bentes 2004" /> Spain, Denmark and Sweden). Some nations, such as Germany, France,<ref name="PNHP 2004">{{cite web|author=Physicians for a National Health Program|year=2004|title=International health systems|location=Chicago|publisher=Physicians for a National Health Program|url=http://www.pnhp.org/facts/international_health_systems.php?page=all|accessdate=November 7, 2006}}</ref> and Japan,<ref name="Chua 2006">{{cite web|last=Chua|first=Kao-Ping|date=February 10, 2006|title=Single payer 101|location=Sterling, Virginia|publisher=American Medical Student Association|url=http://www.amsa.org/uhc/SinglePayer101.pdf|archivedate=October 24, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024133141/http://www.amsa.org/uhc/SinglePayer101.pdf|accessdate=November 7, 2006|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> employ a multi-payer system in which health care is funded by private and public contributions. However, much of the non-government funding comes from contributions from employers and employees to regulated [[non-profit]] sickness funds. Contributions are compulsory and defined according to law. A distinction is also made between municipal and national healthcare funding. For example, one model is that the bulk of the healthcare is funded by the municipality, specialty healthcare is provided and possibly funded by a larger entity, such as a municipal co-operation board or the state, and medications are paid for by a state agency. A paper by Sherry A. Glied from [[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health|Columbia University]] found that universal health care systems are modestly redistributive and that the progressivity of health care financing has limited implications for overall [[income inequality]].<ref name="Glied 2008">{{cite journal |first=Sherry A. |last=Glied |title=Health Care Financing, Efficiency and Equity |date=March 2008 |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 13881 |doi=10.3386/w13881 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Compulsory insurance===
{{main|National health insurance}}
This is usually enforced via legislation requiring residents to purchase insurance, but sometimes the government provides the insurance. Sometimes there may be a choice of multiple public and private funds providing a standard service (as in Germany) or sometimes just a single public fund (as in the Canadian provinces). [[Healthcare in Switzerland]] is based on compulsory insurance.<ref name="Tomasky 2010">{{cite news|last=Tomasky|first=Michael|date=March 21, 2010|title=Healthcare vote: Barack Obama passes US health reform by narrow margin|work=Michael Tomasky's blog|location=London|publisher=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/22/health-care-vote-us-obama|accessdate=March 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/12/26/switzerland-a-case-study-in-consumer-driven-health-care/ |title=Switzerland – a case study in consumer driven health care| work=Forbes | first=Avik | last=Roy}}</ref>

In some European countries where private insurance and universal health care coexist, such as Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, the problem of [[adverse selection]] is overcome by using a risk compensation pool to equalize, as far as possible, the risks between funds. Thus, a fund with a predominantly healthy, younger population has to pay into a compensation pool and a fund with an older and predominantly less healthy population would receive funds from the pool. In this way, sickness funds compete on price and there is no advantage in eliminating people with higher risks because they are compensated for by means of risk-adjusted capitation payments. Funds are not allowed to pick and choose their policyholders or deny coverage, but they compete mainly on price and service. In some countries, the basic coverage level is set by the government and cannot be modified.<ref name="Varkevisser 2002">{{cite journal|last1=Varkevisser|first1=Marco|last2=van der Geest|first2=Stéphanie|year=2002|title=Competition among social health insurers: a case study for the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany|journal=Research in Healthcare Financial Management|volume=7|issue=1|pages=65–84|url=http://oldwww.bmg.eur.nl/personal/varkevisser/RHFM_7(1)_sickness%20funds.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516102517/http://oldwww.bmg.eur.nl/personal/varkevisser/RHFM_7(1)_sickness%20funds.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 16, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2007}}</ref>

The [[Republic of Ireland]] at one time had a "community rating" system by [[VHI]], effectively a single-payer or common risk pool. The government later opened VHI to competition, but without a compensation pool. That resulted in foreign insurance companies entering the Irish market and offering much less expensive health insurance to relatively healthy segments of the market, which then made higher profits at VHI's expense. The government later reintroduced community rating by a pooling arrangement and at least one main major insurance company, BUPA, withdrew from the Irish market.

In Poland, people are obliged to pay a percentage of the average monthly wage to the state, even if they are covered by private insurance.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.nfz-szczecin.pl/bryzv_ubezpieczenie_dobrowolne.htm |title = Ubezpieczenie dobrowolne}}</ref>. People working under a [[employment contract]] pay a percentage of their wage, while entrepreneurs pay a fixed rate, based on the average national wage. Unemployed people are insured by the labor office.

Among the potential solutions posited by economists are single-payer systems as well as other methods of ensuring that health insurance is universal, such as by requiring all citizens to purchase insurance or by limiting the ability of insurance companies to deny insurance to individuals or vary price between individuals.<ref name="Rothschild 1976">{{cite journal|last1=Rothschild|first1=Michael|last2=Stiglitz|first2=Joseph|date=November 1976|title=Equilibrium in competitive insurance markets: an essay on the economics of imperfect information|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=90|issue=4|pages=629–49|doi=10.2307/1885326|jstor=1885326|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dirkb/teach/pdf/rothschild/1976%20equilibrium%20in%20competitive%20insurance.pdf|accessdate=March 20, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203181137/http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dirkb/teach/pdf/rothschild/1976%20equilibrium%20in%20competitive%20insurance.pdf|archive-date=December 3, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Belli 2001">{{cite web|last=Belli|first=Paolo|date=March 2001|title=How adverse election affects the health insurance market.

===Single payer===
{{Main|Single-payer healthcare}}
Single-payer health care is a system in which the government, rather than private insurers, pays for all [[health care]] costs.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/single-payer single-payer], Merriam Webster Dictionary</ref> Single-payer systems may contract for healthcare services from private organizations (as in [[Canada]]) or own and employ healthcare resources and personnel (as was the case in [[England]] before the introduction of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012|Health and Social Care Act]]). In some instances, such as Italy and Spain, both these realities may exist at the same time<ref name=":0" />. "Single-payer" thus describes only the funding mechanism and refers to health care financed by a single public body from a single fund and does not specify the type of delivery or for whom doctors work. Although the fund holder is usually the state, some forms of single-payer use a mixed public-private system.

===Tax-based financing===
In tax-based financing, individuals contribute to the provision of health services through various taxes. These are typically pooled across the whole population unless local governments raise and retain tax revenues. Some countries (notably the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]], [[India]] and the [[Nordic countries]]) choose to fund public health care directly from taxation alone. Other countries with insurance-based systems effectively meet the cost of insuring those unable to insure themselves via [[social security]] arrangements funded from taxation, either by directly paying their medical bills or by paying for insurance premiums for those affected.

===Social health insurance===
In a social health insurance system, contributions from workers, the self-employed, enterprises and governments are pooled into single or multiple funds on a compulsory basis. This is based on [[Risk pool|risk pooling]].<ref>http://apps.searo.who.int/PDS_DOCS/B3457.pdf</ref> The social health insurance model is also referred to as the '''Bismarck Model''', after Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], who introduced the first universal health care system in Germany in the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/health_care_systems_four_basic_models.php | title=Health Care Systems - Four Basic Models &#124; Physicians for a National Health Program}}</ref> The funds typically contract with a mix of public and private providers for the provision of a specified benefit package. Preventive and public health care may be provided by these funds or responsibility kept solely by the Ministry of Health. Within social health insurance, a number of functions may be executed by parastatal or non-governmental sickness funds, or in a few cases, by private health insurance companies. Social health insurance is used in a number of Western European countries and increasingly in Eastern Europe as well as in Israel and Japan.<ref>{{Cite journal |editor-last=Saltman |editor-first=Richard B. |editor2-last=Busse |editor2-first=Reinhard |editor3-last=Figueras |editor3-first=Josep |title=Social health insurance systems in western Europe |url=https://www.who.int/health_financing/documents/shi_w_europe.pdf}}</ref>

===Private insurance===
In private health insurance, premiums are paid directly from employers, associations, individuals and families to insurance companies, which pool risks across their membership base. Private insurance includes policies sold by commercial for-profit firms, non-profit companies and community health insurers. Generally, private insurance is voluntary in contrast to social insurance programs, which tend to be compulsory.<ref name="WHO 2008">{{cite web|author=World Health Organization|year=2008|title=Health financing mechanisms: private health insurance|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|url=https://www.who.int/health_financing/mechanisms/en/index3.html|archivedate=October 9, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009045515/http://www.who.int/health_financing/mechanisms/en/index3.html|accessdate=April 11, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In some countries with universal coverage, private insurance often excludes certain health conditions that are expensive and the state health care system can provide coverage. For example, in the United Kingdom, one of the largest private health care providers is [[BUPA]], which has a long list of general exclusions even in its highest coverage policy,<ref name="Bupa 2010">{{cite web|author=Bupa|year=2010|title=Individuals: Health and life cover: Health care select 1: Key features of this health insurance plan: What's covered?

In the United States, dialysis treatment for [[end stage renal failure]] is generally paid for by government and not by the insurance industry. Those with privatized [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] ([[Medicare Advantage]]) are the exception and must get their dialysis paid for through their insurance company. However, those with end-stage kidney failure generally cannot buy Medicare Advantage plans.<ref name="CMS 2010">{{cite web|author=Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services|year=2010|title=Medicare coverage of kidney dialysis & kidney transplant services|location=Baltimore|publisher=Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services|url=http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/10128.pdf|accessdate=April 11, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527131844/http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/10128.pdf|archive-date=May 27, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  In the Netherlands, which has regulated competition for its main insurance system (but is subject to a budget cap), insurers must cover a basic package for all enrollees, but may choose which additional services they offer in supplementary plans (which most people possess - citation needed).

The [[Planning Commission of India]] has also suggested that the country should embrace insurance to achieve universal health coverage.<ref name="Varshney 2012">{{cite web|last1=Varshney|first1=Vibha|last2=Gupta|first2=Alok|last3=Pallavi|first3=Aparna|date=September 30, 2012|title=Universal health scare|work=Down To Earth|location=New Delhi|publisher=Society for Environmental Communications|url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/universal-health-scare|accessdate=September 25, 2012}}</ref> General tax revenue is currently used to meet the essential health requirements of all people.

===Community-based health insurance===
A particular form of private health insurance that has often emerged, if financial risk protection mechanisms have only a limited impact, is community-based health insurance. Individual members of a specific community pay to a collective health fund which they can draw from when they need medical care. Contributions are not risk-related and there is generally a high level of community involvement in the running of these plans.

Universal health care systems vary according to the degree of government involvement in providing care or health insurance. In some countries, such as Canada, the UK, Spain, Italy, Australia, and the Nordic countries, the government has a high degree of involvement in the commissioning or delivery of health care services and access is based on residence rights, not on the purchase of insurance. Others have a much more pluralistic delivery system, based on obligatory health with contributory insurance rates related to salaries or income and usually funded by employers and beneficiaries jointly.

Sometimes, the health funds are derived from a mixture of insurance premiums, salary-related mandatory contributions by employees or employers to regulated sickness funds, and by government taxes. These insurance based systems tend to reimburse private or public medical providers, often at heavily regulated rates, through mutual or publicly owned medical insurers. A few countries, such as the Netherlands and Switzerland, operate via privately owned but heavily regulated private insurers, which are not allowed to make a profit from the mandatory element of insurance but can profit by selling supplemental insurance.

Universal health care is a broad concept that has been implemented in several ways. The common denominator for all such programs is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards. Most implement universal health care through legislation, regulation, and taxation. Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided, to whom, and on what basis. Usually, some costs are borne by the patient at the time of consumption, but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues. Some programs are paid for entirely out of tax revenues. In others, tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long-term chronic care.

A critical concept in the delivery of universal healthcare is that of population healthcare. This is a way of organizing the delivery, and allocating resources, of healthcare (and potentially social care) based on populations in a given geography with a common need (such as [[asthma]], [[end-of-life care|end of life]], [[urgent care]]). Rather than focus on institutions such as hospitals, primary care, community care etc. the system focuses on the population with a common as a whole. This includes people currently being treated, and those that are not being treated but should be (i.e. where there is [[Health equity|health inequity]]). This approach encourages [[integrated care]] and a more effective use of resources.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Managing population healthcare|journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume = 110|issue = 11|pages = 434–439|language=en|doi=10.1177/0141076817721099|pmc=5728616|pmid=29148874|year = 2017|last1 = Gray|first1 = M.|last2 = Pitini|first2 = E.|last3 = Kelley|first3 = T.|last4 = Bacon|first4 = N.}}</ref>

The United Kingdom [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] in 2003 published an international comparison of ten different health care systems in ten developed countries, nine universal systems against one non-universal system (the United States), and their relative costs and key health outcomes.<ref name="NAO 2003">{{cite web|author=National Audit Office|date=February 1, 2003|title=International health comparisons: a compendium of published information on healthcare systems, the provision of health care and health achievement in 10 countries|location=London|publisher=National Audit Office|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/report/international-health-comparisons-a-compendium-of-published-information-on-healthcare-systems-the-provision-of-health-care-and-health-achievement-in-10-countries/|accessdate=November 7, 2007}}</ref> A wider international comparison of 16 countries, each with universal health care, was published by the [[World Health Organization]] in 2004.<ref name="WHO 2004">{{cite web|last1=Grosse-Tebbe|first1=Susanne|last2=Figueras|first2=Josep|year=2004|title=Snapshots of health systems: the state of affairs in 16 countries in summer 2004|location=Copenhagen|publisher=World Health Organization on behalf of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e85400.pdf|archivedate=September 26, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926062927/http://www.euro.who.int/document/e85400.pdf|accessdate=November 7, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In some cases, government involvement also includes directly managing the [[health care system]], but many countries use mixed public-private systems to deliver universal health care.
