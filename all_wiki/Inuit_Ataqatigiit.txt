In 1982, the party successfully campaigned in a national referendum for Greenland to leave the European Economic Community (EEC). Inuit Ataqatigiit is represented in the [[Folketing]] (the Danish parliament) by Aaja Chemnitz Larsen. Múte B. Egede is the leader of the party since December 2018.

Inuit Ataqatigiit made a major electoral breakthrough in the [[2009 Greenlandic parliamentary election]]. Making gains from the 2005 Greenlandic parliamentary election, it doubled its total number of seats in the Parliament from 7 to 14 seats out of 31 – just two seats short of a majority – and nearly doubled its total vote share from 22.4% to 43.7%. It supplanted both its coalition partners, shifting the [[Forward (Greenland)|Forward]] party from first to second and the [[Democrats (Greenland)|Democrats]] party from second to third.<ref name=bbcnews/><ref name=latimes/> At the [[2014 Greenlandic general election|2014 elections]] the party obtained 11 members in the Greenlandic parliament.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141205002439/http://valg.gl/default.aspx?electionGuid=b0578019-e04f-4cde-92fa-6a3355cd383d&language=da-DK Valg.gl]</ref>
