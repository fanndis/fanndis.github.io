==Early life==
Timothy was born in [[Birmingham]], the son of a steel worker and a school secretary.<ref name="Economist The sage of Birmingham">{{cite web|title=The sage of Birmingham: Theresa May’s pugnacious chief-of-staff prescribes a new direction for the Conservative Party|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21703391-theresa-mays-pugnacious-chief-staff-prescribes-new-direction-conservative-party|website=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=24 August 2016}}</ref> He was educated at [[King Edward VI Aston School|King Edward VI Grammar School in Aston, Birmingham]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/theresa-mays-top-advisor-brummie-11613394|title=Theresa May's top advisor is a Brummie who loves Aston Villa|first=Jonathan|last=Walker|date=14 July 2016|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> and at the [[University of Sheffield]], where he gained a First in Politics.<ref name="Profiles: Nick Timothy Schools Week" /><ref>{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Hannah|title=School selection plans could undo years of reform – Morgan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37322295|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>

He has cited as his inspiration in politics the Birmingham-born [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician [[Joseph Chamberlain]], of whom he wrote a short biography for the Conservative History Group.<ref name="CHG">{{cite web|title=Conservative History Group: Books|url=https://conservativehistory.wordpress.com/books/|website=Conservative History Group|quote=Joseph Chamberlain was one of the dominant figures of Victorian and Edwardian Britain – but while he is remembered for his record as Mayor of Birmingham, his role in committing the Conservative Party to social reform has been neglected by modern Tories. In this study, Nick Timothy explores the many roles Chamberlain played during his political life – Radical and Unionist; outsider and Cabinet Minister – and argues that his legacy is every bit as important to modern Conservatism as Disraeli's 'One Nation' approach and Randolph Churchill's Tory Democracy|accessdate=24 August 2016}}</ref> He has supported conservative philosophies which he believes benefit poorer people and has suggested the Conservative party should focus on benefiting all citizens.<ref name="Economist The sage of Birmingham"/><ref name="ConservativeHome profile">{{cite web|last1=Gimson|first1=Andrew|title=Profile: Nick Timothy, May’s thinker-in-chief and co-Chief of Staff|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/highlights/2016/07/profile-nick-timothy-mays-thinker-in-chief-and-co-chief-of-staff.html|website=[[ConservativeHome]]|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref>

===Home Office===
In 2010, Theresa May was appointed Secretary of State at the [[Home Office]] and appointed Timothy as a special adviser. He spent five years working for the Home Secretary, before leaving, in 2015, to become a Director at the [[New Schools Network]] (NSN).<ref name="Profiles: Nick Timothy Schools Week" /><ref name="Centre for Science and Policy">{{cite web|title=Nick Timothy|url=http://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/network/nick-timothy/|website=Centre for Science and Policy|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="Nick Timothy: Theresa May’s political ‘brain’">{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=George|title=Nick Timothy: Theresa May’s political ‘brain’|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/29fa0986-49cf-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c.html|website=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref>

===New Schools Network===
While at the NSN he spoke in favour of ending the [[The 50% Rule|50% Rule]] which requires oversubscribed Free Schools to allocate half of their places without reference to faith.<ref name="NTimothyBBC2016">{{cite news|last1=Coughlan|first1=Sean|title=Call to end limit on religious free schools|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35411525|accessdate=27 August 2017|work=BBC|date=28 January 2016}}</ref>

In 2015, Timothy wrote an article to express his worry that the People's Republic of China was effectively buying Britain's silence on [[Human rights in China|allegations of Chinese human rights abuse]] and opposing China's involvement in sensitive sectors such as the [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station]]. He criticised [[David Cameron]] and [[George Osborne]] for "selling our [[national security]] to China" and asserted that "the Government seems intent on ignoring the evidence and presumably the advice of the security and intelligence agencies." He warned that security experts were worried that the Chinese could use their role in the programme to build weaknesses into [[computer systems]] which would allow them to shut down Britain's energy production at will and argued that "no amount of trade and investment should justify allowing a hostile state easy access to the country's critical national infrastructure."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval Why have ministers delayed final approval for Hinkley Point C?], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 July 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/10/nick-timothy-the-government-is-selling-our-national-security-to-china.html Nick Timothy: The Government is selling our national security to China], [[Conservative Home]], 20 October 2015</ref>

In October 2016, the ''[[Health Service Journal]]'' rated him as the fifth most influential person in the English NHS in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=HSJ100 2016: The list in full|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/newsletter/hsj-knowledge/top-leader-lists/hsj100/hsj100-2016-the-list-in-full/7011348.article|accessdate=27 October 2016|work=Health Service Journal|date=11 October 2016}}</ref>

Timothy has stated that he voted to leave the [[European Union]] in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 membership referendum]].<ref name="I’ve already voted Leave">{{cite web|last1=Timothy|first1=Nick|title=I've already voted Leave – but these wretched campaigns show everything that's wrong with British politics|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/06/nick-timothy-ive-already-voted-leave-but-i-cant-wait-to-get-away-from-this-bloody-referendum-campaign.html|website=[[ConservativeHome]]|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="Beware the aides of May!" />

===Downing Street===
Following David Cameron's resignation as Prime Minister in the wake of the Brexit referendum result, Timothy took a sabbatical from his position at the NSN to work on [[2016 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|Theresa May's 2016 leadership campaign]]. May's campaign was a success and Timothy was appointed Joint Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister on 14 July 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/may-appoints-former-advisers-as-joint-chiefs-of-staff|title=May appoints former advisers as joint chiefs of staff|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=15 July 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In spring 2017, May called a [[2017 United Kingdom general election|snap general election]]. As a result of the election, the Conservative Party lost its majority and became a minority government dependent on the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] for their majority. Timothy, along with [[Fiona McLeod Hill|Fiona Hill]], faced immediate calls for his removal.<ref name="monsters">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/09/tories-say-theresa-may-must-sack-advisers-fiona-hill-nick-timothy-monsters-sunk-party|title=Tories say Theresa May must sack 'monsters who sunk our party'|author=Anushka Asthana and Rowena Mason|website=The Guardian|date=9 June 2017}}</ref> Theresa May was also given an ultimatum by Conservative Members of Parliament, to sack Timothy or face her own leadership challenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/09/theresa-mays-clique-blamed-disastrous-result-senior-tories/|title='A toxic clique': Calls for Theresa May's closest advisers, Nick and Fiona, to be sacked or PM will face leadership challenge on Monday|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref>

Reflecting in 2020 on the projected cost of adult social care, Timothy wrote "Many things went wrong in that election campaign, but I resigned as joint Chief of Staff in Downing Street because our social care proposal blew up the manifesto."<ref>{{Cite journal
