The '''National Health Service''' ('''NHS''') is the umbrella term for the [[publicly funded health care|publicly-funded healthcare systems]] of the [[United Kingdom]] (UK). Since 1948 they have been funded out of general taxation. There are four systems, one for each of the four [[countries of the UK]]: The [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] in England, [[NHS Scotland]], [[NHS Wales]] and [[Health and Social Care (Northern Ireland)|Health and Social Care]] in Northern Ireland. They were established together in 1948 as one of the major social reforms following the [[Second World War]].  The founding principles were that services should be comprehensive, universal and free at the point of delivery—a health service based on clinical need, not ability to pay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/nhscoreprinciples.aspx|title=The principles and values of the NHS in England |last= Choices|first=NHS|website=www.nhs.uk|access-date=2016-11-23}}</ref> Each service provides a comprehensive range of [[health services]], free at the point of use for people ordinarily resident in the UK, apart from dental treatment and optical care.<ref name=entitle>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-entitlements-migrant-health-guide |title=NHS entitlements: migrant health guide – Detailed guidance|website=UK Government|access-date= 6 June 2016}}</ref>  In England, NHS patients have to pay [[prescription charges]]; some, particularly those receiving state benefits, are exempt.

Each of the UK's health service systems operates independently and is politically accountable to the relevant government: the [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Government]], [[Northern Ireland Executive]], and the [[UK Government]], responsible for England's NHS. Since 2013 operational responsibility for the NHS in England has been passed to [[NHS England]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2018-05/worlds_biggest_quango_ifg_may2017.pdf|title=The first five years of NHS England|last=Timmins|first=Nicholas|date=24 May 2018|website=Institute for Government and The Kings Fund}}</ref> NHS Wales was originally part of the same structure as that of England until powers over the NHS in Wales were first transferred to the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] in 1969 and thereafter, in 1999, to the [[Welsh Assembly]] as part of Welsh devolution. Some functions may be routinely performed by one health service on behalf of another. For example, Northern Ireland has no high-security [[psychiatric hospital]]s and depends on hospitals in Great Britain, routinely at [[State Hospital|Carstairs hospital]] in Scotland for male patients and [[Rampton Secure Hospital]] in England for female patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/publications/guidance-transfer-mentally-disordered-patients-august-2011|title=Guidance on the Transfer of Mentally Disordered Patients August 2011|access-date=15 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408015941/https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/publications/guidance-transfer-mentally-disordered-patients-august-2011|archive-date=8 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Similarly, patients in north Wales use specialist facilities in Manchester and Liverpool which are much closer than facilities in Cardiff, and more routine services at the [[Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust|Countess of Chester Hospital]].  There have been issues about cross-border payments.<ref>{{cite news|title=Breakdown of cross-border agreements is costing English trusts millions|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/home/breakdown-of-cross-border-agreements-is-costing-english-trusts-millions/691359.article|access-date=19 January 2016|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=14 February 2008}}</ref>

Taken together, the four National Health Services in 2015–2016 employed around 1.6 million people with a combined budget of £136.7 billion.<ref>{{cite news|title=10 truths about Britain's health service|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/18/10-truths-about-britains-health-service?CMP=share_btn_tw|access-date=19 January 2016|publisher=Guardian|date=18 January 2016}}</ref>  In 2014, the total health sector workforce across the UK was 2,165,043.  This broke down into 1,789,586 in England, 198,368 in Scotland, 110,292 in Wales and 66,797 in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cowper|first1=Andy|title=Visible and valued: the way forward for the NHS's hidden army|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-knowledge/commissions-and-inquiries/non-clinical-workforce/visible-and-valued-the-way-forward-for-the-nhss-hidden-army/7005016.article|access-date=28 July 2016|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=23 May 2016}}</ref> In 2017, there were 691,000 nurses registered in the UK, down 1,783 from the previous year. However, this is the first time nursing numbers have fallen since 2008. Every 24 hours it sees one million patients, and with 1.7 million staff it is the fifth biggest employer in the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42572110|title=10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble|last=Triggle|first=Nick|date=2018-05-24|access-date=2019-10-06|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Although there has been increasing policy divergence between the four National Health Services in the UK, it can be difficult to find evidence of the effect of this on performance since, as Nick Timmins says: "Some of the key data needed to compare performance – including data on waiting times – is defined and collected differently in the four countries."<ref>{{cite news|title=Outcomes in EHCI 2015|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|access-date=27 January 2016|publisher=Health Consumer Powerhouse|date=26 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606082345/http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|archive-date=6 June 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Timmins|first1=Nick|title=The four UK health systems: Learning from each other|url=http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/four-uk-health-systems-june-2013|website=Kings Fund|access-date=2 February 2016|date=13 June 2013}}</ref> Statistics released in December 2017 showed that, compared with 2012-2013, the number of patients in Scotland waiting more than four hours in [[emergency department|accident and emergency]] dropped by 9% (from about 8% of all A&E patients to about 6%), whereas in England that proportion had increased by 155% (from less than 5% of all A&E patients to about 11%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-42255434|title=Scottish A&E bucks trend on long waits|work=BBC|date=7 December 2017|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> However, since then, Scotland in common with the other three UK nations has experienced increasing pressure in Accident and Emergency departments with lengthening waiting times.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://stv.tv/news/politics/1434835-a-e-waiting-times-hit-worst-level-since-last-march/|title=STV}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/patients-left-in-pain-as-waiting-time-target-missed-again-1-4922194|title=The Scotsman|date=7 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/health/snp-urged-to-apologise-after-waiting-time-target-breached-100-000-times-in-2019-1-4987946|title=The Scotsman|date=21 August 2019}}</ref>

When purchasing drugs, the NHS has significant market power that, based on its own assessment of the fair value of the drugs, influences the global price, typically keeping prices lower.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/06/uk-has-much-fear-us-trade-agreement|title=The UK has much to fear from a US trade agreement|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref> Several other countries either copy the UK's model or directly rely on Britain’s assessments for their own decisions on state-financed drug reimbursements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/us-takes-aim-at-the-uks-national-health-service/|title=US takes aim at the UK's National Health Service|date=2019-06-04|website=POLITICO|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>

Calls for a "unified medical service" can be dated back to the [[Minority report (Poor Law)|Minority Report]] of the [[Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905–09|Royal Commission on the Poor Law]] in 1909.<ref>Brian Abel-Smith, ''The Hospitals 1800–1948'' (London, 1964), p.229</ref> 

[[Somerville Hastings|Dr. Somerville Hastings]], President of the [[Socialist Medical Association]], successfully proposed a resolution at the 1934 [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|Labour Party Conference]] that the party should be committed to the establishment of a State Health Service.<ref>{{cite news |title=Health Service debate |url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/2018/06/14/health-service-debate-1934-labour-party-conference/ |access-date=30 June 2018 |publisher=Labour Party |date=October 1934}}</ref>

Following the 1942 [[Beveridge Report]]'s recommendation to create "comprehensive health and rehabilitation services for prevention and cure of disease", cross-party consensus emerged on introducing a National Health Service of some description.<ref name="Beveridge Report">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/19_07_05_beveridge.pdf | title=Social Insurance and Allied Services | publisher=HM Stationery Office | date=November 1942 | access-date=3 March 2013 | author=Beveridge, William}}</ref> Conservative MP and Health Minister, [[Henry Willink]] later advanced this notion of a National Health Service in 1944 with his consultative White Paper "A National Health Service" which was circulated in full and short versions to colleagues, as well as in newsreel.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyjbUK88CB4 White Paper – A National Health Service], YouTube</ref>

When [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 election]] he appointed [[Aneurin Bevan]] as [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Minister]]. Bevan then embarked upon what the official historian of the NHS, Charles Webster, called an "audacious campaign" to take charge of the form the NHS finally took.<ref>Charles Webster, The Health Services since the War, Volume 1: Problems of Health Care, The National Health Service Before 1957 (London: HMSO, 1988), p. 399.</ref> Bevan's National Health Service was proposed in Westminster legislation for [[National Health Service Act 1946|England and Wales]] from 1946 and [[National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947|Scotland]] from 1947, and the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland Parliament]]'s Public Health Services Act 1947.<ref>Ruth Barrington, ''Health, Medicine & Politics in Ireland 1900–1970'' (Institute of Public Administration: Dublin, 1987) pp. 188–89.</ref> [[Charles Webster (historian of medicine)|Charles Webster]], official historian of the NHS, wrote in 2002 that "the [[Luftwaffe]] achieved in months what had defeated politicians and planners for at least two decades.<ref>Webster C. The National Health Service: a political history. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002.</ref>

[[NHS Wales]] was split from [[NHS (England)]] in 1969 when control was passed to the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] before transferring to the [[Welsh Assembly Government|Welsh Executive]] and [[Welsh Assembly|Assembly]] under devolution in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wales.nhs.uk/nhswalesaboutus/historycontext/1960s|title=NHS Wales {{!}} 1960's|last=Wales|first=NHS|website=www.wales.nhs.uk|access-date=2016-11-22|date=23 October 2006}}</ref>

The NHS was born out of the ideal that good healthcare should be available to all, regardless of wealth. Although being freely accessible regardless of wealth maintained Henry Willink's principle of free healthcare for all, Conservative MPs were in favour of maintaining local administration of the NHS through existing arrangements with local authorities fearing that an NHS which owned hospitals on a national scale would lose the personal relationship between doctor and patient.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1946/apr/30/national-health-service-bill|publisher= Hansard|date= 30 April 1946 |title=NHS Bill Second Reading}}</ref>

Conservative MPs voted in favour of their amendment to Bevan's Bill to maintain local control and ownership of hospitals and against Bevan's plan for national ownership of all hospitals. The Labour government defeated Conservative amendments and went ahead with the NHS as it remains today;  a single large national organisation (with devolved equivalents) which forced the transfer of ownership of hospitals from local authorities and charities to the new NHS. Bevan's principle of ownership with no private sector involvement has since been diluted, with later Labour governments implementing large scale financing arrangements with private builders in [[private finance initiative]]s and joint ventures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/field/field_publication_file/perspectives-estates-nhs-property-nigel-edwards-jul13.pdf_|title=Kingsfund, July 2013}}</ref>

At its launch by Bevan on 5 July 1948 it had at its heart three core principles: That it meet the needs of everyone, that it be free at the point of delivery, and that it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/aboutnhs/Pages/NHSCorePrinciples.aspx |title=The NHS in England – About the NHS – NHS core principles |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=23 March 2009 |access-date=27 June 2017}}</ref>

Three years after the founding of the NHS, Bevan resigned from the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] in opposition to the introduction of charges for the provision of dentures and glasses.<ref>Kenneth O. Morgan, 'Aneurin Bevan' in Kevin Jeffreys (ed.), ''Labour Forces: From Ernie Bevin to Gordon Brown'' (I.B. Taurus: London & New York, 2002), pp. 91–92.</ref> The following year, [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[Third Churchill ministry|Conservative government]] introduced prescription charges. These charges were the first of many controversies over reforms to the NHS throughout its history.<ref>Martin Powell and Robin Miller, 'Seventy Years of Privatising the British National Health Service?', ''Social Policy & Administration'', vol. 50, no. 1 (January 2016), pp. 99–118.</ref>

From its earliest days, the [[History of the National Health Service#Cultural History of the NHS|cultural history of the NHS]] has shown its place in British society reflected and debated in film, TV, cartoons and literature. The NHS had a prominent slot during the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony#Second to the right, and straight on till morning (21:35–21:47)|2012 London Summer Olympics opening ceremony]] directed by [[Danny Boyle]], being described as "the institution which more than any other unites our nation".<ref>{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's intro on Olympics programme |url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |publisher=Awards Daily |first=Ryan |last=Adams |date=27 July 2012 |access-date=27 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206135250/http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |archive-date=6 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Eligibility for treatment==
{{see also|Immigration health surcharge}}
UK residents are not charged for most medical treatment, though [[NHS dentistry]] does have standard charges in each of the four national health services in the UK. In addition, most patients in England have to pay charges for prescriptions though some<!--some patients or some prescriptions?--> are exempted.

[[Aneurin Bevan]], in considering the provision of NHS services to overseas visitors wrote, in 1952, that it would be "unwise as well as mean to withhold the free service from the visitor to Britain. How do we distinguish a visitor from anybody else? Are British citizens to carry means of identification everywhere to prove that they are not visitors? For if the sheep are to be separated from the goats both must be classified. What began as an attempt to keep the Health Service for ourselves would end by being a nuisance to everybody."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bevan|first1=Aneurin|title=In Place of Fear|date=1952|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/the-sma-and-the-foundation-of-the-national-health-service-dr-leslie-hilliard-1980/aneurin-bevan-and-the-foundation-of-the-nhs/in-place-of-fear-a-free-health-service-1952/|access-date=2 April 2018}}</ref>

The provision of free treatment to non-UK-residents, formerly interpreted liberally, has been increasingly restricted, with new overseas visitor hospital charging regulations introduced in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-overseas-visitors-hospital-charging-regulations |title=Guidance on overseas visitors hospital charging regulations  |website=UK Government|date=6 April 2016  |access-date= 6 June 2016}} Links to many relevant documents: Guidance on implementing the overseas visitor hospital charging regulations 2015; Ways in which people can be lawfully resident in the UK; Summary of changes made to the way the NHS charges overseas visitors for NHS hospital care; Biometric residence permits: overseas applicant and sponsor information; Information sharing with the Home Office: guidance for overseas patients; Overseas chargeable patients, NHS debt and immigration rules: guidance on administration and data sharing; Ordinary residence tool; and documents on Equality analysis.</ref>

Citizens of the EU holding a valid [[European Health Insurance Card]] and persons from certain other countries with which the UK has reciprocal arrangements concerning health care can get emergency treatment without charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/reality-check/2015/aug/11/are-foreigners-gaming-nhs-pay-medical-treatment-abroad-ehic|title=Are foreigners really gaming the NHS to pay for their medical treatment abroad?|first=Alberto|last=Nardelli|date=11 August 2015|website=the Guardian}}</ref>

The NHS is free at the point of use, for [[general practitioner]] (GP) and emergency treatment not including admission to hospital, to non-residents.<ref name=hospserv>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/AboutNHSservices/uk-visitors/Pages/access-services-in-England.aspx |title=Visiting or moving to England? – How to access NHS services (see "Hospital Services" section)|website=NHS Choices |date=26 June 2015  |access-date= 6 June 2016}}</ref> People with the right to medical care in [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) nations are also entitled to free treatment by using the [[European Health Insurance Card]].

People not ordinarily resident in the UK are in general not entitled to free hospital treatment, with some exceptions such as [[refugee]]s.<ref name=entitle/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/AboutNHSservices/uk-visitors/visiting-england/Pages/categories-of-exemption.aspx |title=Categories of exemption – Healthcare in England for visitors – NHS Choices |website=NHS England |date=18 August 2015  |access-date= 6 June 2016}}</ref>

People not [[Ordinary resident status|ordinarily resident]] may be subject to an interview to establish their eligibility, which must be resolved before non-emergency treatment can commence.  Patients who do not qualify for free treatment are asked to pay in advance or to sign a written undertaking to pay, except for emergency treatment.

People from outside the EEA coming to the UK for a temporary stay of more than six months are required to pay an immigration health surcharge at the time of [[Visa (document)|visa]] application, and will then be entitled to NHS treatment on the same basis as a resident. This includes overseas students with a visa to study at a recognised institution for 6 months or more, but not visitors on a tourist visa.<ref>Bruno Rodrigues, [http://www.immigration.media/important-nhs-charges-in-visa-applications/ "Important NHS charges in visa applications"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221041359/http://www.immigration.media/important-nhs-charges-in-visa-applications/ |date=21 December 2018 }}, "Immigration Media", 18 March 2015</ref> In 2016 the surcharge was £200 per year, with exemptions and reductions in some cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/AboutNHSservices/uk-visitors/moving-to-england/Pages/moving-from-outside-the-eea.aspx#surcharge |title=Moving from outside the EEA – Access to healthcare in England  |newspaper=Nhs.uk |date=18 August 2015  |author=NHS Choices |access-date= 6 June 2016}}</ref>  It is to increase to £400 in 2018.

From 15 January 2007, anyone who is working outside the UK as a [[missionary]] for an organisation with its principal place of business in the UK is fully exempt from NHS charges for services that would normally be provided free of charge to those resident in the UK. This is regardless of whether they derive a salary or wage from the organisation, or receive any type of funding or assistance from the organisation for the purposes of working overseas.<ref>National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989</ref> This is in recognition of the fact that most missionaries would be unable to afford private health care and those working in developing countries should not effectively be penalised for their contribution to development and other work.

Those who are not [[Ordinary resident status|ordinarily resident]] (including [[British nationality law|British citizens]] who may have paid National Insurance contributions in the past) are liable to charges for services.

There are some other categories of people who are exempt from the residence requirements such as specific government workers and those in the [[armed forces]] stationed overseas.

Some 60% of the NHS budget is used to pay staff. A further 20% pays for drugs and other supplies, with the remaining 20% split between buildings, equipment, training costs, medical equipment, catering and cleaning. Nearly 80% of the total budget is distributed by local trusts in line with the particular health priorities in their areas.<ref>https://portal.rcem.ac.uk/LIVE/docs/International/6.5.2%20Part-2---The-structure-and-funding-of-the-NHS.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Since 2010, there has been a cap of 1% on pay rises for staff continuing in the same role.

===Rising social care costs===
Social care will cost more in future according to research by Liverpool University, University College London, and others and higher investment are needed.  Professor [[Helen Stokes-Lampard]] of the [[Royal College of GPs]] said, “It’s a great testament to medical research, and the NHS, that we are living longer – but we need to ensure that our patients are living longer with a good quality of life. For this to happen we need a properly funded, properly staffed health and social care sector with general practice, hospitals and social care all working together – and all communicating well with each other, in the best interests of delivering safe care to all our patients.”<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/24/nhs-faces-staggering-increase-in-cost-of-elderly-care-academics-warn-dementia NHS faces staggering increase in cost of elderly care, academics warn] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

===Mental health===
{{See|Mental health in the United Kingdom}}

Some patients have to wait excessively long for mental health care.  The [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] found some must wait up to thirteen months for the right care.  Wendy Burn of the Royal College of Psychiatrists said, “It is a scandal that patients are waiting so long for treatment.  The failure to give people with mental illnesses the prompt help they need is ruining their lives.” Even patients who are suicidal or who have attempted suicide are sometimes denied treatment; patients are told they are not ill enough or waiting lists are too long. During very long waits for treatment, one in three patients deteriorate, and they may become unemployed or get divorced. One in four patients throughout the UK wait over three months to see an NHS mental health professional, with 6% waiting at least a year.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/09/mental-health-patients-waiting-nhs-treatment-delays Delays in NHS mental health treatment 'ruining lives'] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

The [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] found mental health provisions for children and young people will not meet growing demand, despite promises of increased funding.  Even if promises to provide £1.4bn more for the sector are kept, there will be “significant unmet need” due to staff shortages, inadequate data and failure to control spending by NHS clinical commissioning groups. Currently one-quarter of young people needing mental health services can get NHS help.  The [[Department of Health and Social Care]] hopes to raise the ratio to 35%.  Efforts to improve mental health provisions could reveal previously unmet demand.<ref name="theguardian.com">[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/09/children-young-people-mental-health-services-demand-national-audit-office Child mental health services will not meet demand, NAO warns] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

[[Meg Hillier]] of the select committee on public accounts said, “The government currently estimates that less than a third of children and young people with a diagnosable mental health condition are receiving treatment.  But the government doesn’t understand how many children and young people are in need of treatment or how funding is being spent locally. The government urgently needs to set out how departments, and national and local bodies, are going to work together to achieve its long-term ambition.” [[Amyas Morse]] said, “Current targets to improve care are modest and even if met would still mean two-thirds of those who need help are not seen. Rising estimates of demand may indicate that the government is even further away than it thought.”<ref name="theguardian.com"/>

In response, [[NHS England]] has embarked on a major programme to expand mental health services, whose budgets are now growing faster than the NHS overall.<ref name="mind.org.uk">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/news/mind-responds-to-nhs-long-term-plan/|title=Mind responds to NHS long term plan|website=www.mind.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref> MIND the mental health charity responded saying: "We are pleased that the plan includes a commitment of £2.3bn a year towards mental health, to help redress the balance. The plan promises that this money will see around two million more people with anxiety, depression and other mental health problems receive help, including new parents, and 24 hour access to crisis care. The plan also includes a guarantee that investment in primary, community and mental health care will grow faster than the growing overall NHS budget so that different parts of the NHS come together to provide better, joined-up care in partnership with local government. Since the funding announcement in the summer, Mind has been working with the NHS, Government and voluntary sector to help shape the long term plan. This longer-term strategy was developed in consultation with people with mental health problems to ensure their views are reflected."<ref name="mind.org.uk"/>

===Surgery===
Waiting times for routine surgery have fallen substantially since 2000. As of July 2019, the median wait for planned care in England is under 8 weeks. The number of people waiting over 12 months has fallen from over 200,000 in the 1980s to under 2000 in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/|title=Statistics » Consultant-led Referral to Treatment Waiting Times|website=www.england.nhs.uk|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref> However the number of patients on the waiting list has risen recently as constrained funding, hospital beds and staffing growth has not kept up with increasing patient need.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/07/nhs-cancels-14-of-operations-at-last-minute-research-finds NHS cancels 14% of operations at last minute, research finds] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

===Electronic systems===
Twenty-one different electronic systems are used in the NHS to record data on patients.  These systems do not communicate well with each other so there is a risk doctors treating a patient will not know everything they need to know to treat the patient effectively.  There were 11 million patient interactions out of 121 million where information from a previous visit could not be accessed.  Half the Trusts using Electronic Medical Records used one of three systems and at least those three should be able to share information.  A tenth of Trusts used multiple systems in the same hospital.  Dr Leigh Warren who participated in the research said, "Hospitals and GPs often don't have the right information about the right patient in the right place at the right time.  This can lead to errors and accidents that can threaten patients' lives."<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50675361 NHS e-health systems 'risk patient safety'] 7 December 2019 ''[[BBC]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>

===Sale of data===
Information on millions of NHS patients was sold to international pharmaceutical companies, in the US and other nations for research, adding to concerns over USA ambitions to access remunerative parts of the NHS after Brexit.  There is concern over lack of transparency and clarity over the data and how it is used.  Phil Booth of medConfidential [https://medconfidential.org/], campaigning for privacy of health data said, “Patients should know how their data is used. There should be no surprises. While legitimate research for public health benefit is to be encouraged, it must always be consensual, safe and properly transparent. Do patients know – have they even been told by the one in seven GP practices across England that pass on their clinical details – that their medical histories are being sold to multinational pharma companies in the US and around the world?”<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/07/nhs-medical-data-sales-american-pharma-lack-transparency Patient data from GP surgeries sold to US companies] 7 December 2019 ''[[The Observer]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>

===Medicines===
In November 2019 unprecedented shortages of medicines patients need developed.  Drugs to treat cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, mental health conditions, some eye conditions, antibiotics for tuberculosis and drugs to control epilepsy are among those in short supply.  Life saving drugs will have to be rationed and not all patients who need them will get them.  Some patients can be switched onto other drugs, though this may increase the workload of hard-pressed medical staff; other patients cannot be switched to alternative drugs.  Many problems can impact the supply chain, like IT failure, speculators stockpiling drugs, alterations in regulation and sudden disease outbreaks.  Dr Tony O’Sullivan of [[Keep Our NHS Public]] said, “The Health Department’s guidance includes an unprecedented list of drugs unavailable or in short supply. Patients and clinicians alike should be on high alert when the advice includes how to ‘share stocks’ to make them last, to ‘prioritise’ patients already on specific treatments including cancer rather than a new patient and effectively how to ration so many vital drugs. Drug companies’ behaviour must be controlled. We must urgently protect the NHS from further risks of loss of control of drug prices and supplies from trade deals with the US and that requires returning it to a wholly public service.”<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/18/revealed-nhs-running-short-of-dozens-of-lifesaving-medicines Revealed: NHS running short of dozens of lifesaving medicines] 18 November 2019 ''[[The Guardian]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50465563 Britain's 'unprecedented' drug shortage] 19 November 2019 ''[[BBC]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>
