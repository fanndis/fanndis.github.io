==History==
The Christian Democratic Union was created on February 8, 1997, in [[Kyiv]], [[Ukraine]] as the '''Party of Christian-Popular Union''' ({{lang-uk|Партія Християнсько-народний союз}})<ref>[https://archive.today/20121222175018/http://www.stretovych.org.ua/biography.html Personal website of the leader of Christian Democratic Union Volodymyr Stretovych]</ref> to promote the ideas of European Christian democracy in Ukraine. It was an offspring of the [[Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine]] and in 1996-1998 split off along with the All-Ukrainian Alliance of Christians.

During the [[1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] the party was part of the electoral bloc "Forward Ukraine" ({{lang-uk|Виборчий блок партій "Вперед, Україно!"}})<ref name=DATA>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.da-ta.com.ua/mon_mainnews/833.htm?print=1 Партія Християнсько-Демократичний Союз] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305141734/http://www.da-ta.com.ua/mon_mainnews/833.htm?print=1 |date=March 5, 2016 }}, Database DATA</ref> which won 1 ([[Single-member district plurality|single-mandate]] [[constituency]]) seat.

In the 4th Congress of [[Christian People's Union|CPU]] in 2003 some regional organisation of three parties united with it ([[Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine]], [[Ukrainian Christian Democratic Party]] and All-Ukrainian Alliance of Christians), forming a new party on the base of [[Christian People's Union|CPU]] - Christian Democratic Union. A well-known Ukrainian lawyer, Dr. [[Volodymyr Stretovych]] became the CDU's president.
