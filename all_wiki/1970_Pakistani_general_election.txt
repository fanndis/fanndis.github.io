'''General elections''' were held in [[Pakistan]] on 7 December 1970 to elect members of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. They were the first general elections since the [[Partition of India|independence of Pakistan]] and ultimately the only ones held prior to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|independence of Bangladesh]]. Voting took place in 300 constituencies, of which 162 were in [[East Pakistan]] and 138 in [[West Pakistan]].

The elections were a fierce contest between two [[Socialism in Pakistan|social democratic]] parties, the [[West Pakistan|west-based]] [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) and the [[East Pakistan|east-based]] [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]]. The Awami League was the sole major party in the east wing, while in the west wing, the PPP faced severe competition from the conservative factions of [[Pakistan Muslim League|Muslim League]], the largest of which was [[Muslim League (Qayyum)]], as well as [[Islamism|Islamist]] parties like [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] (JI), [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]] (JUI) and [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan]] (JUP).

The result was a victory for the Awami League, which won an absolute majority of 160 seats, all of which were in East Pakistan. The PPP won only 81 seats, all in West Pakistan. In the [[1970 Pakistani provincial elections|provincial elections]] held ten days later, the Awami League again dominated in East Pakistan, while the PPP were the winning party in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]. The [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[National Awami Party (Wali)|National Awami Party]] emerged victorious in [[Northwest Frontier Province]] and [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]].

The National Assembly was initially not inaugurated as President [[Yahya Khan]] and the PPP chairman [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] did not want a party from East Pakistan in federal government.<ref>[https://www.dawn.com/news/686541/1970-polls-when-election-results-created-a-storm 1970 polls: When election results created a storm] Dawn, 8 January 2012</ref> Instead, Yahya appointed the veteran [[Bengali people|Bengali]] politician [[Nurul Amin]] as [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], asking him to reach a compromise between the PPP and Awami League. However, this move failed as the delay in inauguration had already caused significant unrest in East Pakistan. The situation escalated into a [[Bangladesh Liberation War|civil war]] that led to the formation of the independent state of [[Bangladesh]].<ref>[https://www.dawn.com/news/1392750 History: Bhutto, Mujib and the generals] Dawn, 4 May 2019</ref> The Assembly was eventually inaugurated in 1972 after Yahya resigned and handed power to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. Bhutto became Prime Minister in 1973 after the post was recreated by a [[Constitution of Pakistan|new constitution]].

==Background==
On 23 March 1956, Pakistan changed from being a [[Dominion]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and became an [[Islamic republic]] after framing its own [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|constitution]]. Although the first general elections were scheduled for early 1959, severe political instability led President [[Iskander Mirza]] to abrogate the constitution on 7 October 1958. Mirza imposed [[1958 Pakistani coup d'état|martial law]] and handed power to the [[Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army|Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Pakistan Army]], General [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Muhammad Ayub Khan]]. After assuming presidency, President Ayub Khan promoted himself to the rank of [[Field marshal]] and appointed General [[Muhammad Musa|Muhammad Musa Khan]] as the new Commander-in-Chief.

On 17 February 1960, President Ayub Khan appointed a commission under [[Muhammad Shahabuddin]], the [[Chief Justice of Pakistan]], to report a political framework for the country. The commission submitted its report on 29 April 1961, and on the basis of this report, a [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|new constitution]] was framed on 1 March 1962. The new constitution, declaring the country as Republic of Pakistan, brought about a [[presidential system]] of government, as opposed to the [[parliamentary system]] of government under the 1956 Constitution. The electoral system was made [[Indirect election|indirect]], and the "basic democrats" were declared [[electoral college]] for the purpose of electing members of the National and Provincial Assemblies. Under the new system, [[1965 Pakistani presidential election|presidential election]] were held on 2 January 1965 which resulted in a victory for Ayub Khan. As years went by, political opposition against President Ayub Khan mounted. In [[East Pakistan]], leader of the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]], [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], was one of the key leaders to rally opposition to President Ayub Khan. In 1966, he began the [[Six point movement]] for East Pakistani autonomy.

In 1968, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was charged with [[sedition]] after the government of President Ayub Khan accused him for [[Agartala Conspiracy Case|conspiring]] with [[India]] against the stability of Pakistan.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb|url-access=registration|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb/page/190 190]}}</ref> While a conspiracy between Mujib and India for East Pakistan's secession was not itself conclusively proven,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb|url-access=registration|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb/page/193 193]|quote=The Agartala contacts however did not provide solid evidence of a Mujib-India secessionist conspiracy in East Pakistan}}</ref> it is known that Mujib and the Awami League had held secret meetings with Indian government officials in 1962 and after the 1965 war.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb|url-access=registration|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb/page/190 190]|quote=It is now clear that Mujib did hold secret discussions with local Indian leaders there in July 1962.

The [[Socialism in Pakistan|socialist]] political party took up opposition to President Ayub Khan as well.

Ayub Khan succumbed to [[Pressure politics|political pressure]] on 26 March 1969 and handed power to the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army, General [[Yahya Khan|Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan]]. President Yahya Khan imposed martial law and the 1962 Constitution was abrogated. On 31 March 1970, President Yahya Khan announced a [[Legal Framework Order, 1970|Legal Framework Order (LFO)]] which called for direct elections for a unicameral legislature. Many in the West feared the East wing's demand for countrywide provincial autonomy.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb|url-access=registration|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb/page/193 193]|quote=When this duly arrived. the western wing's nightmare scenario materialised: either a constitutional deadlock, or the imposition in the whole of the country of the Bengalis' longstanding commitment to unfettered democracy and provincial autonomy.}}</ref> The purpose of the LFO was to secure the future Constitution which would be written after the election<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb|url-access=registration|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb/page/193 193]|quote=Yahya had made some provision to safeguard the constitutional outcome through the promulgation of the Legal Framework Order (LFO) on 30 March 1970.

The [[One Unit|integrated province]] of West Pakistan, which was formed on 22 November 1954, was abolished and four provinces were retrieved: [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]]. The principles of [[Representation (politics)|representation]] was made on the basis of population, and since East Pakistan had more population than the combined population of the four provinces of West Pakistan, the former got more than half seats in the National Assembly. Yahya Khan ignored reports that Sheikh Mujib planned to disregard the LFO and that India was increasingly interfering in East Pakistan.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb|url-access=registration|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb/page/194 194]|quote=He also refused to countenance intelligence service reports both of Mujib's aim to tear up the LFO after the elections and establish Bangladesh and of India's growing involvement in the affairs of East Pakistan.}}</ref> Nor did he believe that the Awami League would actually sweep the elections in East Pakistan.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb|url-access=registration|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb/page/193 193]|quote=From November 1969 until the announcement of the national election results, he discounted the possibility of an Awami League landslide in East Pakistan.}}</ref>

A month before the election, the [[Bhola cyclone]] struck East Pakistan. This was the deadliest [[tropical cyclone]] in world history, killing on the order of 500,000 people. The Pakistan government was severely criticised for its response.

==Parties and candidates==
The general elections of 1970 are considered one of the fairest and cleanest elections in the history of Pakistan, with about twenty-four political parties taking part. The general elections presented a picture of a [[Two-party system]], with the [[Awami League]], a Bengali nationalist party, competing against the extremely influential and widely popular [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], a leftist and [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party which had been a major power-broker in West Pakistan. The Pakistani government supported the pro-Islamic parties since they were committed to strong federalism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb|url-access=registration|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb/page/196 196]|quote=The regime also increasingly favoured the Islam pasand (Islam loving) parties because of their conservatism and attachment to the idea of a strong central government}}</ref> The Jamaat-e-Islami suspected that the Awami League had secessionist intentions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb|url-access=registration|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbot|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/pakistanmodernhi00talb/page/196 196]|quote=The JI itself warned that an Awami League victory would mean the disintegration of Pakistan.}}</ref>

===Election campaign in East Pakistan===
<!-- West Pakistan no longer exist before the elections. LFO Order No. 1970 had devolved West Pakistan into Pakistan (its current picture). See West Pakistan page and Legal Framework Order, 1970. -->
The continuous public meetings of the [[Awami League]] in East Pakistan and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] in Western Pakistan attracted huge crowds. The Awami League, a Bengali nationalist party, mobilised support in East Pakistan on the basis of its [[Six point movement|Six-Points Program]] (SPP), which was the main attraction in the party's manifesto.  In East Pakistan, a huge majority of the Bengali nation favoured the Awami League, under [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|Sheikh Mujib]]. The party received a huge percentage of the popular vote in East Pakistan and emerged as the largest party in the nation as a whole, gaining the [[exclusive mandate]] of Pakistan in terms both of seats and of votes.

The [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] failed to win any seats in [[East Pakistan]]. On the other hand, the Awami League had failed to gather any seats in [[West Pakistan]]. The Awami League's failure to win any seats in the west was used by the leftists led by Zulfikar Bhutto who argued that Mujib had received "no mandate or support from West Pakistan" (ignoring the fact that he himself did not win any seat in [[East Pakistan]]).<ref name="[[Yale University Press]]">{{cite book|title=Pakistan: Eye of the Storm|author=Owen Bennett-Jones|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|pages=146–180|year=2003|isbn=978-0-300-10147-8}}</ref>

The then leaders of [[Pakistan]], all from [[West Pakistan]] and PPP leaders, strongly opposed the idea of an East Pakistani-led government.<ref name="[[Yale University Press]]"/> Many in Pakistan predicted that the Awami League-controlled government would oversee the passage of a new constitution with a simple majority.<ref name="[[Yale University Press]]"/> Bhutto uttered his infamous phrase "''idhar hum, udhar tum''" (We rule here, you rule there) – thus dividing Pakistan for the first time orally.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/545869/idhar-hum-udhar-tum-abbas-athar-remembered/|title=Idhar hum, udhar tum: Abbas Athar remembered  - The Express Tribune|date=2013-05-08|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-US}}</ref>

The same attitudes and emotions were also felt in East Pakistan whereas East-Pakistanis absorbed the feeling and reached to the conclusion that Pakistan had been benefited with economic opportunities, investments, and social growth would swiftly depose any East Pakistanis from obtaining those opportunities.<ref name="[[Yale University Press]]"/>

Some Bengalis sided with the Pakistan Peoples' Party and tacitly or openly supported Bhutto and the democratic socialists, such as [[Jalaludin Abdur Rahim]], an influential Bengali in Pakistan and mentor of Bhutto,<ref name="[[Yale University Press]]"/> who was later jailed by Bhutto. Jamat-e-Islami, while supporting allowing the Awami League to form a government, was also against the fragmentation of the country. Conversely, several prominent figures from [[West Pakistan]] supported allowing the Awami League to rule, including the poet [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]] and rights activist Malik Ghulam Jilani, father of [[Asma Jahangir]], [[G.M Syed]] the founder of Sindhi nationalist party Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (JSQM) and Abul Ala Maududi, the leader of Jamat-e-Islami.

===Elections in West Pakistan===
However, the political position in West Pakistan was completely different from East Pakistan. In West Pakistan, the population was divided between different ideological forces. The [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal|right-wing]] parties, led under [[Abul Ala Maududi|Abul Maududi]], raised the [[Islam in Pakistan|religious slogans]] and initially campaigned on an [[Political Islam|Islamic platform]], further promising to enforce [[Sharia law]]s in the country. Meanwhile, the founding party of Pakistan and the national conservative [[Pakistan Muslim League|Muslim League]], that although was divided into three factions ([[Muslim League (Qayyum)|QML]], [[Convention Muslim League|CML]], [[Council Muslim League|MLC]]), campaigned on a nationalist platform, promising to initiate the Jinnah reforms as originally envisioned by Jinnah and others in the 1940s. The factions however criticised each other for disobeying the rules laid down by the country's founding father.

The dynamic leadership and charismatic personality of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] was highly active and influential in West Pakistan during these days. Bhutto's ideas and the famous slogan "''[[Roti Kapra Aur Makaan]]''" ("Food, Clothing and Shelter") attracted poor communities, students, and the working class to his party. Under Bhutto's leadership the democratic left gathered and united into one [[party platform]] for the first time in Pakistan's history. Bhutto and the left-leaning elements attracted the people of the West to participate and vote for the Peoples Party based on a broad hope for a better future for their children and families. As compared to the right-wing and conservatives in West Pakistan, Bhutto and his allies won most of the popular vote, becoming the pre-eminent players in the politics of the West.

===Nominations===
A total of 1,957 candidates filed nomination papers for 300 National Assembly seats. After scrutiny and withdrawals, 1,579 eventually contested the elections. The [[Awami League]] ran 170 candidates, of which 162 were for constituencies in East Pakistan. Jamaat-e-Islami had the second-highest number of candidates with 151. The [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] ran only 120 candidates, of which 103 were from constituencies in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]], and none in East Pakistan. The [[Convention Muslim League|PML (Convention)]] ran 124 candidates, the [[Council Muslim League|PML (Council)]] 119 and the [[Muslim League (Qayyum)|PML (Qayyum)]] 133.

==Results==
The government claimed a high level of public participation and a voter turnout of almost 63%. The total number of registered voters in the country was 56,941,500 of which 31,211,220 were from [[East Pakistan]] and 25,730,280 were from [[West Pakistan]].

==Aftermath==
The elected Assembly initially did not meet as President Yahya Khan and the Pakistan Peoples Party did not want the majority party from East Pakistan forming government. This caused great unrest in East Pakistan which soon escalated into the call for independence on March 26, 1971 and ultimately led to [[Bangladesh War of Independence|war of independence]] with [[East Pakistan]] becoming the independent state of [[Bangladesh]]. The Assembly session was eventually held when Khan resigned four days after Pakistan surrendered in Bangladesh and [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] took over. Bhutto became the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1973, after the post was recreated by the new Constitution.
