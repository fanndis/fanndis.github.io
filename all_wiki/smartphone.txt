A '''smartphone''' is a [[mobile device]] that combines [[mobile phone|cellular]] and [[mobile computing]] functions into one unit. They are distinguished from [[feature phone]]s by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive [[mobile operating system]]s, which facilitate wider [[application software|software]], [[internet]] (including [[web browsing]]<ref>"[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329502453_A_Survey_of_Techniques_for_Improving_Efficiency_of_Mobile_Web_Browsing A Survey of Techniques for Improving Efficiency of Mobile Web Browsing]", CPE, 2018</ref> over [[mobile broadband]]), and [[multimedia]] functionality (including music, video, [[camera phone|camera]]s, and [[mobile gaming|gaming]]), alongside core phone functions such as [[telephone call|voice call]]s and [[text messaging]]. Smartphones typically contain a number of [[metal–oxide–semiconductor]] (MOS) [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chips, include various [[sensor]]s that can be leveraged by their software (such as a [[magnetometer]], [[proximity sensor]]s, [[barometer]], [[gyroscope]], or [[accelerometer]]), and support [[wireless]] communications protocols (such as [[Bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi]], or [[satellite navigation]]).

Early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market, attempting to bridge the functionality of standalone [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) devices with support for cellular [[telephony]], but were limited by their bulky form, [[History of the battery|short battery life]], slow analog [[cellular networks]], and the immaturity of wireless data services. These issues were eventually resolved with the [[MOSFET scaling|exponential scaling]] and [[miniaturization]] of [[MOS transistor]]s down to [[List of semiconductor scale examples|sub-micron levels]] ([[Moore's law]]), the improved [[lithium-ion battery]], faster [[digital electronics|digital]] [[Mobile broadband|mobile data networks]] ([[Edholm's law]]), and more mature [[Mobile operating system|software]] [[Computing platform|platforms]] that allowed mobile device [[Digital ecosystem|ecosystems]] to develop independently of [[Mobile network operator|data providers]].

In the 2000s, [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[i-mode]] platform, [[BlackBerry]], [[Nokia]]'s [[Symbian]] platform, and [[Windows Mobile]] began to gain market traction, with models often featuring [[QWERTY]] keyboards or [[resistive touchscreen]] input, and emphasizing access to [[push email]] and wireless internet. Following the rising popularity of the [[iPhone]] in the late 2000s, the majority of smartphones have featured thin, slate-like [[Form factor (mobile phones)|form factors]], with large, [[capacitive sensing|capacitive]] screens with support for [[multi-touch]] gestures rather than physical keyboards, and offer the ability for users to download or purchase additional [[mobile app|applications]] from a centralized [[app store|store]], and use [[Mobile cloud storage|cloud storage]] and synchronization, [[virtual assistant]]s, as well as [[mobile payment]] services. Smartphones have largely replaced PDAs and [[handheld PC|handheld/palm-sized PCs]].

Improved hardware and faster wireless communication (due to standards such as [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]) have bolstered the growth of the smartphone industry. In the third quarter of 2012, one billion smartphones were in use worldwide.<ref name="Don Reisinger">{{cite web |title=Worldwide smartphone user base hits 1 billion |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57534132-94/worldwide-smartphone-user-base-hits-1-billion/ |work=[[CNet]] |access-date=July 26, 2013 |author=Don Reisinger|date=October 17, 2012}}</ref> Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013.<ref name="news1">{{cite news | url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Smartphones-now-outsell-dumb-phones/tabid/412/articleID/295878/Default.aspx | work= 3 News NZ | title= Smartphones now outsell 'dumb' phones | date= April 29, 2013 | access-date= April 29, 2013 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130801114353/http://www.3news.co.nz/Smartphones-now-outsell-dumb-phones/tabid/412/articleID/295878/Default.aspx | archive-date= August 1, 2013 | url-status= dead | df= mdy-all }}</ref>

===PDA/phone hybrids===
{{main|Personal digital assistant}}

Beginning in the mid-late 1990s, many people who had mobile phones carried a separate dedicated [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] device, running early versions of operating systems such as [[Palm OS]], [[Newton OS]], [[Symbian]] or [[Windows CE]]/[[Pocket PC]]. These operating systems would later evolve into early [[mobile operating system]]s. Most of the "smartphones" in this era were hybrid devices that combined these existing familiar PDA OSes with basic phone hardware. The results were devices that were bulkier than either dedicated mobile phones or PDAs, but allowed a limited amount of cellular Internet access. PDA and mobile phone manufacturers competed in reducing the size of devices. The bulk of these smartphones combined with their high cost and expensive data plans, plus other drawbacks such as expansion limitations and decreased battery life compared to separate standalone devices, generally limited their popularity to "[[early adopter]]s" and business users who needed portable connectivity.

In March 1996, [[Hewlett-Packard]] released the [[OmniGo 700LX]], a modified [[HP 200LX]] palmtop PC with a [[Nokia 2110]] mobile phone [[Piggy-back (transportation)|piggybacked]] onto it and [[Read-only memory|ROM]]-based software to support it.  It had a 640×200 resolution CGA compatible four-shade gray-scale LCD screen and could be used to place and receive calls, and to create and receive text messages, emails and faxes.  It was also 100% [[DOS]] 5.0 compatible, allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles, including early versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

[[File:Nokia-9110-9000.jpg|thumb|The Nokia 9000 Communicator (right) and the updated 9110 model (left)]]
In August 1996, [[Nokia]] released the [[Nokia 9000 Communicator]], a digital cellular PDA based on the [[Nokia 2110]] with an integrated system based on the [[PEN/GEOS 3.0]] operating system from [[Geoworks]]. The two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a [[clamshell design]], with the display above and a physical [[QWERTY keyboard]] below. The PDA provided e-mail; calendar, address book, [[calculator]] and notebook applications; text-based Web browsing; and could send and receive faxes. When closed, the device could be used as a digital cellular telephone.

In June 1999 [[Qualcomm]] released the "pdQ Smartphone", a [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] digital [[Personal Communications Service|PCS]] smartphone with an integrated [[Palm OS|Palm]] PDA and Internet connectivity.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.qualcomm.com/media/releases/1999/06/15/qualcomm-s-pdq-smartphone-provides-ideal-platform-wireless-business | title=Qualcomm's pdQ Smartphone | publisher=Qualcomm}}</ref>

=== Japanese cell phones ===
{{main|Japanese mobile phone culture|Mobile phone industry in Japan}}

In 1999, Japanese wireless provider [[NTT DoCoMo]] launched [[i-mode]], a new [[mobile internet]] platform which provided data transmission speeds up to 9.6 kilobits per second, and access web services available through the platform such as online shopping. NTT DoCoMo's i-mode used [[cHTML]], a language which restricted some aspects of traditional [[HTML]] in favor of increasing data speed for the devices. Limited functionality, small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available. The rise of i-mode helped NTT DoCoMo accumulate an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001, and ranked first in market capitalization in Japan and second globally.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Frank|title=Pocket Monster: How DoCoMo's wireless Internet service went from fad to phenom - and turned Japan into the first post-PC nation|journal=Wired|date=Sep 2001|volume=9|issue=9|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.09/docomo_pr.html|access-date=January 24, 2014}}</ref> Japanese cell phones increasingly diverged from global standards and trends to offer other forms of advanced services and smartphone-like functionality that were specifically tailored to the [[Japanese mobile phone culture|Japanese market]], such as [[mobile payment]]s and shopping, [[near-field communication]] (NFC) allowing [[Osaifu-Keitai|mobile wallet]] functionality to replace [[smart card]]s for transit fares, loyalty cards, identity cards, event tickets, coupons, money transfer, etc., downloadable content like musical [[ringtone]]s, [[Mobile game|game]]s, and [[Mobile comic|comic]]s, and [[1seg]] [[mobile television]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Barnes, Stuart J|first=Huff, Sid L.|title=Rising Sun: iMode and the Wireless Internet, Vol. 46, No. 1|date=November 1, 2003|publisher=Communications of the ACM|pages=79–84}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Anwar|first=Sayid Tariq|title=NTT DoCoMo and M-Commerce: A Case Study in Market Expansion and Global Strategy |url=http://www.itu.dk/~rold/1_sem/B1/Cases/DoCoMo.pdf|publisher=The American Graduate School of International Management |access-date=February 16, 2014}}</ref> Phones built by Japanese manufacturers used custom [[firmware]], however, and didn't yet feature standardized [[mobile operating system]]s designed to cater to [[mobile developers|third-party application development]], so their software and ecosystems were akin to very advanced [[feature phone]]s. As with other feature phones, additional software and services required partnerships and deals with providers.

The degree of integration between phones and carriers, unique phone features, non-standardized platforms, and tailoring to Japanese culture made it difficult for Japanese manufacturers to export their phones, especially when demand was so high in Japan that the companies didn't feel the need to look elsewhere for additional profits.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/technology/20cell.html|title=Why Japan's Smartphones Haven't Gone Global|last=Tabuchi|first=Hiroko|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Budmar|first=Patrick|url=https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/430254/why_japanese_smartphones_never_went_global/|title=Why Japanese smartphones never went global|work=PC World AU|date=11 July 2012|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Devin Stewart |title=Slowing Japan's Galapagos Syndrome |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/devin-stewart/slowing-japans-galapagos_b_557446.html |quote='Galapagos syndrome', a phrase originally coined to describe Japanese cell phones that were so advanced they had little in common with devices used in the rest of the world, could potentially spread to other parts of society.

The rise of [[3G]] technology in other markets and non-Japanese phones with powerful standardized [[mobile operating system|smartphone operating system]]s, [[app store]]s, and advanced wireless network capabilities allowed non-Japanese phone manufacturers to finally break in to the Japanese market, gradually adopting Japanese phone features like [[emoji]]s, mobile payments, NFC, etc. and spreading them to the rest of the world.

=== Early smartphones ===
[[File:BlackBerry_8820,_BlackBerry_Bold_9900_and_BlackBerry_Classic.jpg|thumb|Several [[BlackBerry]] smartphones, which were highly popular in the mid-late 2000s]]
Phones that made effective use of any significant data connectivity were still rare outside Japan until the introduction of the [[Danger Hiptop]] in 2002, which saw moderate success among U.S. consumers as the [[T-Mobile]] Sidekick. Later, in the mid-2000s, business users in the U.S. started to adopt devices based on Microsoft's [[Windows Mobile]], and then [[BlackBerry]] smartphones from [[Research In Motion]]. American users popularized the term "CrackBerry" in 2006 due to the BlackBerry's addictive nature.<ref>{{cite news|title=Info Addicts Are All Thumbs: Crackberry Is the 2006 Word of the Year|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/websters-new-worldr-college-dictionary-info-addicts-are-all-thumbs-55824847.html|access-date=January 24, 2014|newspaper=PR Newswire|date=November 1, 2006}}</ref> In the U.S., the high cost of data plans and relative rarity of devices with [[Wi-Fi]] capabilities that could avoid cellular data network usage kept adoption of smartphones mainly to business professionals and "[[early adopters]]."

Outside the U.S. and Japan, Nokia was seeing success with its smartphones based on [[Symbian]], originally developed by [[Psion (company)|Psion]] for their personal organisers, and it was the most popular smartphone OS in [[Europe]] during the middle to late 2000s.

From 2006 onwards, Nokia started producing consumer-focused smartphones, popularized by the entertainment-focused [[Nokia Nseries|Nseries]]. Until 2010, Symbian was the world's most widely used smartphone operating system.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schroeder |first=Stan |url=http://mashable.com/2010/02/23/gartner-smartphones/ |title=Smartphones in 2009: Symbian Dominates, iPhone, RIM and Android Rising Fast |publisher=Mashable |date=23 February 2010 |access-date=3 September 2013}}</ref>

The touchscreen [[PDA]]-derived nature of adapted operating systems like [[Palm OS]], the "[[Pocket PC]]" versions of what was later [[Windows Mobile]], and the [[UIQ]] interface that was originally designed for pen-based [[PDA]]s on [[Symbian OS]] devices resulted in some early smartphones having stylus-based interfaces. These allowed for virtual keyboards and/or handwriting input, thus also allowing easy entry of Asian characters.<ref name="JobsKilledTheStylus">{{cite web|last1=Whitwam|first1=Ryan|url=https://www.extremetech.com/computing/98923-how-steve-jobs-killed-the-stylus-and-made-smartphones-usable|title=How Steve Jobs killed the stylus and made smartphones usable |website=ExtremeTech |access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref>

By the mid-2000s, the majority of smartphones had a physical [[QWERTY]] keyboard. Most used a "[[Form factor (mobile phones)#Keyboard bars|keyboard bar]]" form factor, like the [[BlackBerry]] line, [[Windows Mobile]] smartphones, [[Palm Treo]]s, and some of the [[Nokia Eseries]]. A few hid their full physical QWERTY keyboard in a [[Form factor (mobile phones)#Slider|sliding form factor]], like the [[Danger Hiptop]] line. Some even had only a [[Telephone keypad|numeric keypad]] using [[T9 (predictive text)|T9 text input]], like the [[Nokia Nseries]] and other models in the [[Nokia Eseries]]. [[Resistive touchscreen]]s with [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]]-based interfaces could still be found on a few smartphones, like the [[Palm Treo]]s, which had dropped their handwriting input after a few early models that were available in versions with [[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]] instead of a keyboard.

=== Form factor and operating system shifts ===

The advantages of a design with software powerful enough to support advanced applications and a large capacitive touchscreen affected the development of another smartphone OS platform, [[Android (operating system)|Android]], with a more BlackBerry-like prototype device scrapped in favor of a touchscreen device with a slide-out physical keyboard, as Google's engineers thought at the time that a touchscreen could not completely replace a physical keyboard and buttons.<ref name=atlantic-startover>{{cite web|title=The Day Google Had to 'Start Over' on Android|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/the-day-google-had-to-start-over-on-android/282479/|work=The Atlantic|access-date=20 December 2013}}</ref><ref name="AndroidInc">{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2005/tc20050817_0949_tc024.htm |title=Google Buys Android for Its Mobile Arsenal |last=Elgin |first=Ben |date=17 August 2005 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |publisher=Bloomberg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205190729/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2005/tc20050817_0949_tc024.htm |archive-date=5 February 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=2012-02-20}}</ref><ref name="EngadgetMobileOS">{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/08/28/google-is-working-on-a-mobile-os-and-its-due-out-shortly |title=Google is working on a mobile OS, and it's due out shortly |last=Block |first=Ryan |work=[[Engadget]] |date=28 August 2007 |access-date=2012-02-17}}</ref> Android is based around a modified Linux kernel, again providing more power than [[mobile operating system]]s adapted from PDAs and feature phones.

==== Smartphone OS competition ====
The iPhone and later touchscreen-only Android devices together popularized the slate [[Form factor (mobile phones)|form factor]], based on a large capacitive touchscreen as the sole means of interaction, and led to the decline of earlier, keyboard- and keypad-focused platforms.<ref name="How iPhone Changed the World" /> Multiple vendors attempted to update or replace their existing smartphone platforms and devices to better-compete with Android and the iPhone; Palm unveiled a new platform known as [[webOS]] for its [[Palm Pre]] in late-2009 to replace [[Palm OS]], which featured a focus on a task-based "card" metaphor and seamless synchronization and integration between various online services (as opposed to the then-conventional concept of a smartphone needing a PC to serve as a "canonical, authoritative repository" for user data).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/01/palm-launches-new-handset-pre-operating-system-at-ces/|title=Palm strikes back with new OS, pre handset at CES|last=Stokes|first=Jon|date=2009-01-08|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/01/of-clouds-palms-webos-and-cutting-the-cord/|title="Synergy" means no need to "save" or "sync" on Palm's pre|last=Stokes|first=Jon|date=2009-01-12|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] acquired Palm in 2010 and released several other webOS devices, including the [[Pre 3]] and [[HP TouchPad]] tablet.

By the mid-2000s, higher-end [[cell phones]] commonly had integrated digital cameras. In 2003 [[camera phone]]s outsold stand-alone digital cameras, and in 2006 they outsold film and digital stand-alone cameras. Five billion camera phones were sold in five years, and by 2007 more than half of the [[installed base]] of all mobile phones were camera phones. Sales of separate cameras peaked in 2008.<ref name="SmartphonesTollonGPS">{{cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Kevin J. |title=Smartphone Sales Taking Toll on G.P.S.

Many early smartphones didn't have cameras at all, and earlier models that had them had low performance and insufficient image and video quality that could not compete with budget pocket cameras and fullfill user's needs.<ref name=Nokia6111>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6111-review-61.php|title=Nokia 6111 review: Venus and maybe Mars too|website=GSMArena.com}}</ref> By the beginning of the 2010s almost all smartphones had an integrated digital camera. The decline in sales of stand-alone cameras accelerated due to the increasing use of smartphones with rapidly improving camera technology for casual photography, easier [[Digital image processing|image manipulation]], and abilities to directly [[Image sharing|share photos]] through the use of [[Mobile app|apps]] and web-based services.<ref name="SmartphonesKillingPoint-and-shoots">{{cite web |last=Ogg |first=Erica |title=Smartphones killing point-and-shoots, now take almost 1/3 of photos |url=https://gigaom.com/2011/12/22/smartphones-killing-point-and-shoots-now-take-almost-13-of-photos/ |website=Gigaom |date={{date|Dec 22, 2011}} |access-date={{date|10/22/2019}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Siegler |first=MG |title=iPhone 4 About To Be Flickr's Top Camera.

Contributing to the rise in popularity of smartphones being used over dedicated cameras for photography, smaller pocket cameras have difficulty producing [[bokeh]] in images, but nowadays, some smartphones have dual-lens cameras that reproduce the bokeh effect easily, and can even rearrange the level of bokeh after shooting. This works by capturing multiple images with different focus settings, then combining the background of the main image with a [[Macro photography|macro focus shot]].

In 2007 the [[Nokia N95]] was notable as a smartphone that had a 5.0 [[Megapixel]] (MP) camera, when most others had cameras with around 3 MP or less than 2 MP. Some specialized feature phones like the [[LG Viewty]], [[Samsung SGH-G800]], and [[Sony Ericsson K850i]], all released later that year, also had 5.0 MP cameras. By 2010 5.0 MP cameras were common; a few smartphones had 8.0 MP cameras and the [[Nokia N8]], [[Sony Ericsson Satio]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newtechnology.co.in/sony-ericsson-satio-a-phone-with-ultimate-multimedia-experience/ |title=Sony Ericsson Satio – A Phone with Ultimate multimedia experience |publisher=Newtechnology.co.in |access-date={{date|2013-06-21}} |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714020642/http://www.newtechnology.co.in/sony-ericsson-satio-a-phone-with-ultimate-multimedia-experience/ |archive-date={{date|2012-07-14}} }}</ref> and [[Samsung M8910 Pixon12]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newtechnology.co.in/samsung-pixon12-m8910-worlds-first-12-megapixel-camera-phone/ |title=Samsung Pixon12 M8910 Price in India - 12 megapixel camera-phone |publisher=Newtechnology.co.in |access-date={{date|2013-06-21}} |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424142402/http://www.newtechnology.co.in/samsung-pixon12-m8910-worlds-first-12-megapixel-camera-phone/ |archive-date={{date|2012-04-24}} }}</ref> feature phone had 12 MP.

=== Display advancements ===
[[File:Samsung Galaxy Note.PNG|thumb|right|[[Samsung Galaxy Note 10]] series smartphones]]
In the early 2010s, larger smartphones with screen sizes of at least {{convert|5.5|inch|mm|order=flip|round=5}} diagonal, dubbed "[[phablet]]s", began to achieve popularity, with the 2011 [[Samsung Galaxy Note series]] gaining notably wide adoption.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/12/29/1-million-galaxy-notes-shipped-worldwide-us-fans-throw-money-at/|title=1 million Galaxy Notes shipped worldwide, US fans throw money at their screens |author=Mat Smith |publisher=[[Engadget]] |date={{date|December 29, 2011}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Samsung: 10M Galaxy Notes sold in nine months |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57493718-94/samsung-10m-galaxy-notes-sold-in-nine-months/ |website=[[CNET]] |access-date={{date|18 January 2013}}}}</ref> In 2013, Huawei launched the [[Huawei Mate series]], sporting a {{convert|6.1|inch|mm|order=flip|round=5}} HD (1280x720) IPS+ LCD display, which was considered to be quite large at the time.<ref>[https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/05/huawei-mate-flagships-history.html/amp History Of The Huawei Mate Flagships] {{date|May 2, 2019}}.</ref>

Some companies began to release smartphones in 2013 incorporating [[flexible display]]s to create curved form factors, such as the [[Samsung Galaxy Round]] and [[LG G Flex]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Samsung's Galaxy Round is the first phone with a curved display |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4818572/samsung-galaxy-round-curved-oled-smartphone-official |website=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media |access-date={{date|21 March 2017}}}}</ref><ref name=engadget-gflexfcc>{{cite web |title=LG G Flex appears on the FCC with AT&T-friendly LTE |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/11/15/lg-g-flex-att-lte/ |work=Engadget |access-date={{date|9 March 2014}}}}</ref><ref name=engadget-gflexannounce>{{cite web |title=LG G Flex announced with vertically curved 6-inch 720p screen, 'self-repairing' back cover |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/10/27/lg-g-flex/ |work=Engadget |publisher=Verizon Media |access-date={{date|9 March 2014}}}}</ref>

By 2014, [[1440p]] displays began to appear on high-end smartphones.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dent |first=Steve |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/18/do-you-really-need-a-4k-smartphone-screen/ |title=Do you really need a 4K smartphone screen? |date={{date|Feb 18, 2014}}}}</ref> In 2015, Sony released the [[Xperia Z5 Premium]], featuring a [[4K resolution]] display, although only images and videos could actually be rendered at that resolution (all other software was shown at 1080p).<ref name="engadget-4k1080psony">{{cite web |title=Sony's 4K smartphone shows most content in 1080p |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/09/15/sony-xperia-z5-premium-not-so-4k/ |website=Engadget |access-date={{date|21 March 2017}}}}</ref>

New trends for smartphone displays began to emerge in 2017, with both LG and Samsung releasing flagship smartphones ([[LG G6]] and [[Galaxy S8]]), utilizing displays with taller [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]]s than the common [[16:9]] ratio, and a high screen-to-body ratio, also known as a "bezel-less design". These designs allow the display to have a larger diagonal measurement, but with a slimmer width than 16:9 displays with an equivalent screen size.<ref name="ndtv-lgg6">{{cite web |title=LG G6 With 5.7-Inch FullVision Display, Google Assistant Launched at MWC 2017 |url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/lg-g6-launched-at-mwc-2017-price-release-date-specifications-and-more-1663697 |website=Gadgets360 |publisher=NDTV |access-date={{date|26 Feb 2017}}}}</ref><ref name="verge-g6unveil">{{cite web |title=The LG G6 is sleek, solid, and surprisingly sensible |url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/26/14741886/lg-g6-announced-specs-features-mwc-2017 |website=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media |access-date={{date|26 Feb 2017}}}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15087530/samsung-galaxy-s8-announced-features-release-date-video-specifications |title=This is the Samsung Galaxy S8, coming April 21st |work=The Verge |access-date={{date|2018-10-04}}}}</ref>

Another trend popularized in 2017 were displays containing tab-like cut-outs at the top-centre—colloquially known as a "notch"—to contain the front-facing camera, and sometimes other sensors typically located along the top bezel of a device.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.livemint.com/Technology/YFHDoI8YuK4SkZqViPN4VN/Why-do-Android-phones-want-a-notch.html |title=Why do Android phones want a notch? |last=Mathur |first=Vishal |date={{date|2018-04-29}} |work=Livemint |access-date={{date|2018-10-04}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3293447/android/android-phone-notch-requirements.html |title=Google thankfully bans Android phones with three notches or other exotic configurations |work=PCWorld |access-date={{date|2018-10-04}}}}</ref> These designs allow for "edge-to-edge" displays that take up nearly the entire height of the device, with little to no bezel along the top, and sometimes a minimal bottom bezel as well.

Other variations of the practice later emerged, such as a "hole-punch" camera (such as those of the [[Honor (brand)|Honor]] View 20, and Samsung's [[Samsung Galaxy A8s|Galaxy A8s]] and [[Galaxy S10]])—eschewing the tabbed "notch" for a circular or rounded-rectangular cut-out within the screen instead,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/146822-hole-punch-camera-vs-notch-vs-slider-honor-samsung|title=Is the hole-punch camera here to stay?

[[Refresh rate]]s greater than 60 Hz first appeared in 2017 on the [[Razer Phone]] and [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] Aquos R Compact, and were popularized by several brands in 2019.

Samsung and LG used to be the ''“last standing”'' manufacturers to offer flagship devices with user-replaceable batteries.
But in 2015, Samsung succumbed to the [[minimalism]] trend set by Apple, introducing the [[Galaxy S6]] without a user-replaceable battery.
In addition, Samsung was criticised for pruning long-standing features such as [[Mobile High-Definition Link |MHL]], Micro[[USB 3.0]], [[Waterproofing|water resistance]] and [[MicroSD]] card support, of which the latter two came back in 2016 with the [[Galaxy S7]] and S7 Edge.

===Central processing unit===
Smartphones have [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), similar to those in computers, but optimised to operate in low power environments. In smartphones, the CPU is typically integrated in a [[CMOS]] (complementary [[metal–oxide–semiconductor]]) [[system-on-a-chip]] (SoC) [[microprocessor|application processor]].<ref name="Kim"/>

The performance of mobile CPU depends not only on the clock rate (generally given in multiples of [[hertz]])<ref>{{cite web
 | title = CPU Frequency
 | work = CPU World Glossary
 | publisher = CPU World
 | date = 25 March 2008
 | url = http://www.cpu-world.com/Glossary/C/CPU_Frequency.html
 | access-date =1 January 2010 }}</ref> but also on the [[memory hierarchy]]. Because of these challenges, the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications.

===Display===
{{main|Display device}}
[[File:Livraria do Senado (22622160063).jpg|thumb|A smartphone touchscreen]]
One of the main characteristics of smartphones is the [[Display device|screen]]. Depending on the device's design, the screen fills most or nearly all of the space on a device's front surface. Many smartphone displays have an [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] of [[16:9]], but taller aspect ratios became more common in 2017.

Screen sizes are measured in diagonal [[inch]]es. Phones with screens larger than 5.2 inches are often called "[[phablet]]s". Smartphones with screens over 4.5 inches in size are commonly difficult to use with only a single hand, since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface; they may need to be shifted around in the hand, held in one hand and manipulated by the other, or used in place with both hands.  Due to design advances, some modern smartphones with large screen sizes and "edge-to-edge" designs have compact builds that improve their ergonomics, while the shift to taller aspect ratios have resulted in phones that have larger screen sizes whilst maintaining the ergonomics associated with smaller 16:9 displays.<ref name="phonearena-s7edgenotphablet">{{cite web|title=Don't call it a phablet: the 5.5" Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is narrower than many 5.2" devices|url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/Dont-call-it-a-phablet-the-5.5-Samsung-Galaxy-S7-Edge-is-narrower-than-many-5.2-devices_id79482|website=PhoneArena|access-date=3 April 2017}}</ref><ref name="verge-phabletpytha">{{cite web|title=We're gonna need Pythagoras' help to compare screen sizes in 2017|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/30/15120824/screen-aspect-ratio-mathematics-galaxy-s8-lg-g6|website=The Verge|access-date=3 April 2017}}</ref><ref name="verge-s8aspectratio">{{cite web|title=The Samsung Galaxy S8 will change the way we think about display sizes|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/30/15121526/samsung-galaxy-s8-vs-google-pixel-iphone-7-screen-size-comparison|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|access-date=3 April 2017}}</ref>

[[Liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs) and [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) displays are the most common. Some displays are integrated with pressure-sensitive digitizers, such as those developed by [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]] and [[Samsung]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=J. R.|last2=Phillips|first2=M. J.|date=1987-04-01|title=Digitizer Technology: Performance Characteristics and the Effects on the User Interface|journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|volume=7|issue=4|pages=31–44|doi=10.1109/MCG.1987.276869|s2cid=16707568|issn=0272-1716}}</ref> and Apple's [[Force Touch]] system.

===Sound===
Some audio quality enhancing features, such as [[Voice over LTE]] and [[HD Voice]] have appeared and are often available on newer smartphones. Sound quality can remain a problem due to the design of the phone, the quality of the cellular network and compression algorithms used in [[long-distance call]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/why-mobile-voice-quality-still-stinksand-how-to-fix-it|title=Why Mobile Voice Quality Still Stinks—and How to Fix It|author=Jeff Hecht|work=ieee.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-cell-phone-call-quality-so-terrible|title=Why Is Cell Phone Call Quality So Terrible?|author=Elena Malykhina|work=scientificamerican.com}}</ref>  Audio quality can be improved using a [[VoIP]] application over [[WiFi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/whats-the-best-mobile-voip-app-1579791681|title=What's the Best Mobile VoIP App?|author=Alan Henry|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Lifehacker}}</ref> Cellphones have small speakers so that the user can use a [[speakerphone]] feature and talk to a person on the phone without holding it to their ear. The small speakers can also be used to listen to digital audio files of music or speech or watch videos with an audio component, without holding the phone close to the ear.

Smartphone users purchase additional chargers for use outside the home, at work, and in cars and by buying portable external "battery packs". External battery packs include generic models which are connected to the smartphone with a cable, and custom-made models that "piggyback" onto a smartphone's case. In 2016, Samsung had to recall millions of the [[Galaxy Note 7]] smartphones due to an explosive battery issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-halts-galaxy-note-7-shipments-phones-catching-fire/|title=Refurbished version of ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 will soon be available overseas|date=May 5, 2017}}</ref>  For consumer convenience, [[inductive charging|wireless charging]] stations have been introduced in some hotels, bars, and other public spaces.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/iphone-wireless-charging-qi/|title=The Most Impactful New iPhone Feature May Be the Most Boring|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Cameras===
{{main|Camera phone|Digital camera|Videophone}}

Cameras have become standard features of smartphones. As of 2019 phone cameras are now a highly competitive area of differentiation between models, with advertising campaigns commonly based on a focus on the quality or capabilities of a device's main cameras.

Typically smartphones have at least one main rear-facing camera and a lower-resolution front-facing camera for "[[selfie]]s" and [[video chat]]. Owing to the limited depth available in smartphones for [[image sensor]]s and [[Lens|optics]], rear-facing cameras are often housed in a "bump" that's thicker than the rest of the phone. Since increasingly thin mobile phones have more abundant horizontal space than the depth that is necessary and used in dedicated cameras for better lenses, there's additionally a trend for phone manufacturers to include multiple cameras, with each optimized for a different purpose ([[Telephoto lens|telephoto]], [[Wide-angle lens|wide angle]], etc.).

Images are usually saved in the [[JPEG]] file format; some high-end phones also have [[Raw image format|RAW]] image capability.

Modern advanced smartphones have cameras with [[Image stabilization#Optical image stabilization|optical image stabilisation]] (OIS), larger sensors, bright lenses, and even optical zoom plus [[Raw image format|RAW]] images. [[High-dynamic-range imaging|HDR]], "[[Bokeh]] mode" with multi lenses and multi-shot [[Night mode camera|night mode]]s are now also familiar.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top 16 Best Camera Phones For Photography 2019 |url=https://www.ephotozine.com/article/top-16-best-camera-phones-for-photography-2019-23050 |date={{date|April 4, 2019}}}}</ref> Many new smartphone camera features are being enabled via [[computational photography]] [[Digital image processing|image processing]] and multiple specialized lenses rather than larger sensors and lenses, due to the constrained space available inside phones that are being made as slim as possible.

===Accessories===
A wide range of accessories are sold for smartphones, including cases, [[screen protector]]s, power charging cables, wireless power stations, [[USB On-The-Go]] adapters (for connecting USB drives and or, in some cases, a HDMI cable to an external monitor), add-on batteries, [[headphones]], combined headphone-microphones (which, for example, allow a person to privately conduct [[Telephone call|call]]s on the device without holding it to the ear), and [[Bluetooth]]-enabled [[powered speaker]]s that enable users to listen to media from their smartphones wirelessly.

Cases range from relatively inexpensive rubber or soft plastic cases which provide moderate protection from bumps and good protection from scratches to more expensive, heavy-duty cases that combine a rubber padding with a hard outer shell. Some cases have a "book"-like form, with a cover that the user opens to use the device; when the cover is closed, it protects the screen. Some "book"-like cases have additional pockets for credit cards, thus enabling people to use them as [[wallet]]s.

Accessories include products sold by the manufacturer of the smartphone and compatible products made by other manufacturers.

==Software==
===Mobile operating systems===
{{Main|Mobile operating system}}

A mobile operating system (or mobile OS) is an [[operating system]] for phones, [[tablet computer|tablet]]s, [[smartwatch]]es, or other [[mobile device]]s.

Mobile operating systems combine features of a [[personal computer]] operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use; usually including, and most of the following considered essential in modern mobile systems; a [[touchscreen]], [[Cellular network|cellular]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]], [[Wi-Fi]], [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) mobile navigation, [[video camera|video-]] and [[digital camera|single-frame picture cameras]], [[speech recognition]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|voice recorder]], [[portable media player|music player]], [[near field communication]], and [[infrared blaster]]. By Q1 2018, over 383 million smartphones were sold with 85.9 percent running [[Android (operating system)|Android]], 14.1 percent running [[iOS]] and a negligible number of smartphones running other OSes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3876865/ |title=Gartner Says Worldwide Sales of Smartphones Returned to Growth in First Quarter of 2018 |date=May 29, 2018 |website=Gartner, Inc. |publisher=Gartner |access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref> Android alone is more popular than the popular desktop operating system Windows, and in general smartphone use (even without tablets) exceeds desktop use.

Sailfish due to Jolla's business model and due to alliances with various partners and due to intentional design of OS internals, is capable to adopt in several layers third party software including Jolla software e.g. Jolla's UI is [[proprietary software]] (closed source), so such components can be proprietary with many different kinds of licences. However, user can replace them with open source components like e.g. NEMO UI instead Jolla's UI. Using third party software extends usability but does not make the OS code close, in the same way as preinstalled Microsoft Word (closed source) on a Linux device does not make Linux closed source.

After Nokia abandoned in 2011 the [[MeeGo]] project, most of the MeeGo team left Nokia, and established Jolla as a company to use MeeGo and [[Mer (software distribution)|Mer]] business opportunities. The MER standard allows it to be launched on any hardware with kernel compatible with MER. In 2012, Linux Sailfish OS based on MeeGo and using middleware of MER core stack distribution was launched for public use. The first device, the [[Jolla (mobile phone)|Jolla smartphone]], was unveiled on May 20, 2013. In 2015, [[Jolla Tablet]] was launched and the [[BRICS]] countries declared it an officially supported OS there. Jolla started licensing Sailfish OS 2.0 for third parties. Some devices sold are updateable to Sailfish 2.0 with no limits.

Each Sailfish OS version release is named after a Finnish lake.

====Tizen====
{{main article|Tizen}}

[[Tizen]] (based on the [[Linux kernel]]) is a mobile operating system hosted by [[Linux Foundation]], together with support from the Tizen Association, guided by a Technical Steering Group composed of [[Intel]] and [[Samsung]].

Tizen is an operating system for devices including smartphones, tablets, [[In-car entertainment|In-Vehicle Infotainment]] (IVI) devices, and smart TVs. It is an open source system (however the SDK was closed source and proprietary) that aims to offer a consistent user experience across devices. Tizen's main components are the Linux kernel and the [[WebKit]] runtime. According to Intel, Tizen "combines the best of LiMo and MeeGo." [[HTML5]] apps are emphasized, with MeeGo encouraging its members to transition to Tizen, stating that the "future belongs to HTML5-based applications, outside of a relatively small percentage of apps, and we are firmly convinced that our investment needs to shift toward HTML5." Tizen will be targeted at a variety of platforms such as handsets, touch pc, smart TVs and in-vehicle entertainment.<ref>[https://www.tizen.org/blogs/dawnfoster/2011/welcome-tizen Welcome to Tizen!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013071516/https://www.tizen.org/blogs/dawnfoster/2011/welcome-tizen |date=October 13, 2011 }}.

====Discontinued operating systems====

=====Bada=====
{{main article|Bada}}

[[Bada]] platform (stylized as bada; Korean: 바다) was an operating system for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. It was developed by Samsung Electronics. Its name is derived from "바다 (bada)", meaning "ocean" or "sea" in Korean. It ranges from mid- to high-end smartphones. To foster adoption of Bada OS, since 2011 Samsung reportedly has considered releasing the source code under an open-source license, and expanding device support to include Smart TVs. Samsung announced in June 2012 intentions to merge Bada into the Tizen project, but would meanwhile use its own Bada operating system, in parallel with Google Android OS and Microsoft Windows Phone, for its smartphones. All Bada-powered devices are branded under the Wave name, but not all of Samsung's Android-powered devices are branded under the name Galaxy.
On February 25, 2013, Samsung announced that it will stop developing Bada, moving development to [[Tizen]] instead. Bug reporting was finally terminated in April 2014.<ref>[http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/samsung-scraps-bada-os-folds-it-tizen/2013-02-25 Samsung scraps Bada OS, folds it into Tizen – FierceMobileIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228062542/http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/samsung-scraps-bada-os-folds-it-tizen/2013-02-25 |date=February 28, 2013 }}.

In 2011, Samsung had the highest shipment [[market share]] worldwide, followed by Apple. In 2013, Samsung had 31.3% market share, a slight increase from 30.3% in 2012, while Apple was at 15.3%, a decrease from 18.7% in 2012. Huawei, LG and Lenovo were at about 5% each, significantly better than 2012 figures, while others had about 40%, the same as the previous years figure.

[[File:Mobile payment 01.jpg|thumb|Mobile payment system.]]
In many countries, mobile phones are used to provide [[mobile banking]] services, which may include the ability to transfer cash payments by secure SMS text message. Kenya's [[M-PESA]] mobile banking service, for example, allows customers of the mobile phone operator [[Safaricom]] to hold cash balances which are recorded on their SIM cards. Cash can be deposited or withdrawn from M-PESA accounts at Safaricom retail outlets located throughout the country and can be transferred electronically from person to person and used to pay bills to companies.

[[Branchless banking]] has been successful in South Africa and the [[Philippines]]. A pilot project in [[Bali]] was launched in 2011 by the [[International Finance Corporation]] and an [[Indonesia]]n bank, [[Bank Mandiri]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/01/branchless-banking-start-bali.html |title=Branchless banking to start in Bali |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=13 April 2012 |access-date=4 June 2012}}</ref>

Another application of mobile banking technology is [[Zidisha]], a US-based nonprofit micro-lending platform that allows residents of developing countries to raise small business loans from Web users worldwide. Zidisha uses mobile banking for loan disbursements and repayments, transferring funds from lenders in the United States to borrowers in rural Africa who have mobile phones and can use the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ |title="Zidisha Set to "Expand" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010 |publisher=Microfinancefocus.com |date=7 February 2010 |access-date=4 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921054251/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia |archive-date=21 September 2012 }}</ref>

Mobile payments were first trialled in Finland in 1998 when two Coca-Cola vending machines in [[Espoo]] were enabled to work with SMS payments. Eventually, the idea spread and in 1999, the Philippines launched the country's first commercial mobile payments systems with mobile operators [[Globe Telecom|Globe]] and [[Smart Communications|Smart]].

Some mobile phones can make [[mobile payment]]s via direct mobile billing schemes, or through [[contactless payment]]s if the phone and the [[point of sale]] support [[near field communication]] (NFC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.banktech.com/blog/archives/2007/06/mobile_payments.html |title=Mobile Payments: Look to Korea |author=Feig, Nancy |publisher=banktech.com |date=25 June 2007 |access-date=29 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326155917/http://www.banktech.com/blog/archives/2007/06/mobile_payments.html |archive-date=26 March 2010 }}</ref> Enabling contactless payments through NFC-equipped mobile phones requires the co-operation of manufacturers, network operators, and retail merchants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connectedplanetonline.com/mobile-apps/news/nfc-mobile-phone-explode-1110/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124001632/http://connectedplanetonline.com/mobile-apps/news/nfc-mobile-phone-explode-1110/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 January 2010 |title=NFC mobile phone set to explode |author=Ready, Sarah |publisher=connectedplanetonline.com |date=10 November 2009 |access-date=29 January 2011 }}

[[File:Hand held phones.JPG|thumb|right|A [[New York City]] driver holding two phones]]

Mobile phone use while driving—including [[Telephone call|call]]ing, [[text messaging]], playing media, [[web browsing]], [[Video game|gaming]], using mapping apps or operating other phone features—is common but controversial, since it is widely considered dangerous due to what is known as [[distracted driving]]. Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of [[accident]]s. In September 2010, the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) reported that 995 people were killed by drivers distracted by phones. In March 2011 a US insurance company, [[State Farm Insurance]], announced the results of a study which showed 19% of drivers surveyed accessed the Internet on a smartphone while driving.<ref name=post>{{cite news |title=Quit Googling yourself and drive: About 20% of drivers using Web behind the wheel, study says |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 4, 2011 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/03/honk-if-youre-googling-20-of-drivers-using-web-behind-the-wheel-says-study.html/ }}</ref> Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving. In Egypt, Israel, Japan, Portugal and Singapore, both handheld and hands-free [[telephone call|calling]] on a mobile phone (which uses a [[speakerphone]]) is banned. In other countries including the UK and France and in many US states, only the use of calling on handheld phones is banned, while hands-free use is permitted.

A 2011 study reported that over 90% of college students surveyed text (initiate, reply or read) while driving.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Choice to Text and Drive in Younger Drivers: Behaviour May Shape Attitude|last1 = Atchley|first1 = Paul|date = January 2011|journal = Accident Analysis and Prevention|doi = 10.1016/j.aap.2010.08.003|pmid = 21094307|first2 = Stephanie|last2 = Atwood|last3 = Boulton|first3 = Aaron|volume=43|issue = 1|pages=134–142}}</ref>
The [[scientific literature]] on the danger of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone, or [[texting while driving]], is limited. A simulation study at the [[University of Utah]] found a sixfold increase in distraction-related accidents when texting.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070714/NEWS01/707140333&template=printart|title=Text messaging not illegal but data clear on its peril|newspaper=Democrat and Chronicle}}</ref>{{dead link|date=December 2019}} Due to the complexity of smartphones that began to grow more after, this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices. This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage, rather than those which ban handheld use only, as officials cannot easily tell which function of the phone is being used simply by looking at the driver. This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a call when, in fact, they were using the device legally, for example, when using the phone's incorporated controls for car stereo, [[GPS]] or [[satnav]].

Accidents involving a driver being distracted by being in a [[Telephone call|call]] on a phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to speeding.

{{Main|Smartphone wars}}
A "patent war" between Samsung and Apple started when the latter claimed that the original [[Samsung Galaxy S|Galaxy S]] Android phone copied the interface{{nsmdns}}and possibly the hardware{{nsmdns}}of Apple's iOS for the [[iPhone 3GS]]. There was also smartphone patents licensing and litigation involving [[Sony Mobile]], [[Google]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]], [[Microsoft]], [[Nokia]], [[Motorola]], [[HTC]], [[Huawei]] and [[ZTE]], among others. The conflict is part of the [[Technology patent wars|wider "patent wars"]] between multinational technology and software corporations. To secure and increase [[market share]], companies granted a [[patent]] can sue to prevent competitors from using the methods the patent covers. Since the 2010s the number of lawsuits, counter-suits, and trade complaints based on patents and [[Industrial design right|designs]] in the market for smartphones, and devices based on [[Mobile operating system|smartphone OSes]] such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]], has increased significantly. Initial suits, countersuits, rulings, license agreements, and other major events began in 2009 as the smartphone market stated to grow more rapidly by 2012.

===Sleep===
{{Main|Electronic media and sleep}}
Using smartphones late at night can disturb sleep, due to the blue light and brightly lit screen, which affects [[melatonin]] levels and [[sleep cycles]]. In an effort to alleviate these issues, "Night Mode" functionality to change the [[color temperature]] of a screen to a warmer hue based on the time of day to reduce the amount of blue light generated became available through several apps for Android and the [[f.lux]] software for [[Jailbreak (iPhone OS)|jailbroken]] iPhones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/199303/reduce-eye-strain-and-get-better-sleep-by-using-f.lux-on-your-computer/|title=Reduce Eye Strain and Get Better Sleep by Using f.lux on Your Computer|last1=Hoffman|first1=Chris|date=October 23, 2014|website=How-To Geek|access-date=January 15, 2016}}</ref> [[iOS 9|iOS 9.3]] integrated a similar, system-level feature known as "[[Night Shift (software)|Night Shift]]." Several Android device manufacturers bypassed Google's initial reluctance to make Night Mode a standard feature in Android and included software for it on their hardware under varying names, before [[Android Oreo]] added it to the OS for compatible devices.<ref>{{cite web |last=Blichert |first=Frederick |title=How to enable Night Mode on Android to reduce eye strain |url=https://www.androidauthority.com/night-mode-on-android-886864/ |date={{date|July 17, 2019}} |access-date={{date|11/8/2019}}}}</ref>

It has also been theorized that for some users, addiction to use of their phones, especially before they go to bed, can result in "[[ego depletion]]." Many people also use their phones as alarm clocks, which can also lead to loss of sleep.<ref name="cnet-bluelight">{{cite web|title=Stop your gadgets from keeping you awake at night|url=http://www.cnet.com/how-to/stop-your-gadgets-from-keeping-you-awake-at-night/|website=CNET|access-date=1 June 2016}}</ref><ref>Kalsbeek, Andries (2012).
