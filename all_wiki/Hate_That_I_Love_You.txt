"Hate That I Love You" received generally positive reviews from critics, many of whom compared it to previous works by Ne-Yo.

The song achieved moderate success in comparison to other singles from the album, reaching the top twenty in thirteen countries.

The best way to express an emotion like love is through storytelling. It makes it more 'I can relate to this character in this song, because I've been through something similar.' You hear that kind of storytelling in the song that I wrote for Rihanna called 'Hate That I Love You'.<ref>{{cite journal|year=2008 |title=What's Love Really Got to Do With It?|journal=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |page=40 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kCYEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Hate+That+I+Love+You%22+Rihanna&pg=PA40|accessdate=January 6, 2012|issn=1070-4701|volume=16}}</ref>}}

The video's opening scene shows the sun rising and Rihanna waking up. Meanwhile, Ne-Yo walks along a street, wearing a hat that obscures most of his face. Rihanna is in her room; she is bored and wondering which clothes to wear, and she finds a gold necklace. As the song starts, Rihanna lies in bed and sings, while Ne-Yo continues walking along the street, approaches the hotel and cautiously looks around before entering it. Meanwhile, Rihanna dresses,<ref name="photographs"/> leaves the room and walks through the hallway of the hotel. Ne-Yo goes in an elevator to the floor of Rihanna's room. As Rihanna waits near the elevator, it opens. Ne-Yo and Rihanna meet and smile at each other as Rihanna enters the elevator and Ne-Yo exits. It is then revealed that Rihanna and Ne-Yo are not singing about each other, but different people. As the video progresses, Rihanna is downstairs, chanting the lyrics of the song and Ne-Yo is in a hallway. He knocks on a door, which his girlfriend opens, and he enters the room. Rihanna simultaneously climbs into her lover's car and they smile at each other. The video ends with the previous scenes showing Rihanna leaving her hotel room. A reviewer from [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV UK]] commented, "After Shut Up And Drive the 19 year old is going even raunchier for this vid- writhing around on a bed in her underwear and pearls."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/rihanna/40660-rihanna-strips|title=Rihanna Strips|publisher=[[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]].

An edited version of the video was produced for the Spanglish version of the song, in which Ne-Yo's scenes are cut and replaced with scenes featuring David Bisbal. The Spanglish version of the video shows Bisbal watching the scenes of Rihanna on film being projected while he sings the song's lyrics.
