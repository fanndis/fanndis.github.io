[[Galen Clark]] and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s signing the [[Yosemite National Park#Yosemite Grant|Yosemite Grant]] in 1864. [[John Muir]] led a successful movement to have [[United States Congress|Congress]] establish a larger national park by 1890, one which encompassed the valley and its surrounding mountains and forests, paving the way for the [[National Park Service#National Park System|National Park System]].<ref name = "historyculture"/>

Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada, and the park supports a diversity of plants and animals. The park has an elevation range from {{convert|2127|to|13114|ft|m}} and contains five major [[life zone|vegetation zones]]: [[chaparral]] and [[oak]] woodland, [[Sierra Nevada lower montane forest|lower montane forest]], upper [[Montane ecosystems#Montane forests|montane forest]], [[Sierra Nevada subalpine zone|subalpine zone]], and [[alpine tundra|alpine]]. Of California's 7,000 plant species, about 50% occur in the Sierra Nevada and more than 20% are within Yosemite. The park contains suitable habitat for more than 160 rare plants, with rare local [[geology|geologic]] formations and unique [[soil]]s characterizing the restricted ranges many of these plants occupy.<ref name = "naturehistory"/>

The [[geology of the Yosemite area]] is characterized by granitic rocks and remnants of older rock. About 10&nbsp;million years ago, the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and then tilted to form its relatively gentle western slopes and the more dramatic eastern slopes. The uplift increased the steepness of stream and river beds, resulting in the formation of deep, narrow canyons. About one million years ago, snow and ice accumulated, forming glaciers at the higher alpine meadows that moved down the river valleys. Ice thickness in Yosemite Valley may have reached {{convert|4000|ft|m}} during the early glacial episode. The downslope movement of the ice masses cut and sculpted the [[U-shaped valley]] that attracts so many visitors to its scenic vistas today.<ref name="naturehistory"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Yosemite" (meaning "killer" in [[Miwok]]) originally referred to the name of a tribe which was driven out of the area (and possibly annihilated) by the [[Mariposa Battalion]]. Previously, the area had been called "Ahwahnee" ("big mouth") by indigenous people.<ref>{{cite web|title = Origin of the Word Yosemite&nbsp;– What does Yosemite mean?

The indigenous tribe that lived in the Valley were called Yosemites by caucasians and by other tribes because they lived in a place where grizzly bears were common and they were reportedly skilled at killing the bears.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-04-22|title=The Origins of Place Names in Yosemite|url=https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/travel/national-parks/the-origins-of-place-names-in-yosemite/|access-date=2020-09-05|website=Hachette Book Group|language=en-US}}</ref>

Yosemite Valley has been inhabited for nearly 3,000 years, although humans may have first visited the area as long as 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Yosemite: Official National Park Service Handbook|last = NPS contributors|publisher = National Park Service|year = 1989|isbn = |location = Washington, DC|page = 102|series = no. 138}}</ref> The indigenous natives called themselves the [[Ahwahnechee]], meaning "dwellers in Ahwahnee".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Yosemite: The Embattled Wilderness|last = Runte|first = Alfred|publisher = University of Nebraska Press|year = 1990|isbn = 0-8032-3894-0|location = |pages = Chapter 1|url = https://archive.org/details/yosemiteembattle00runt}}</ref> They are related to the Northern [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] and [[Mono (tribe)|Mono]] tribes. Many tribes visited the area to trade, including nearby Central [[Sierra Miwoks]], who lived along the drainage area of the [[Tuolumne River|Tuolumne]] and [[Stanislaus River|Stanislaus]] Rivers.{{sfn|Greene|1987|p=57}} A major trading route went over [[Mono Pass (Yosemite)|Mono Pass]] and through [[Bloody Canyon]] to [[Mono Lake]], just to the east of the Yosemite area. Vegetation and game in the region were similar to that present today; acorns were a staple to their diet, as well as other seeds and plants, salmon and deer.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-yosemite-hiking-california-sidwcmdev_056853.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140528045059/http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-yosemite-hiking-california-sidwcmdev_056853.html|archivedate = May 28, 2014 |title = The Living Yosemite – The Ahwahnechee (One Hundred Hikes in Yosemite)|date = April 29, 2002|accessdate = May 27, 2014|website = Great Outdoor Recreation Pages|publisher = |last = Schaffer|first = Jeffrey P.}}</ref>{{unreliable source|date=November 2020}}

The [[California Gold Rush]] in the mid-19th century dramatically increased travel by European-Americans in the area, causing competition for resources between the regional Paiute and Miwok and the miners and hangers on. In 1851 as part of the Mariposa Wars intended to suppress Native American resistance, [[United States Army]] Major [[Jim Savage]] led the [[Mariposa Battalion]] into the west end of Yosemite Valley. He was pursuing forces of around 200 Ahwahneechee led by [[Chief Tenaya]].<ref name="GeologyNP326">{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=326}}</ref>

Accounts from this battalion were the first well-documented reports of ethnic Europeans entering Yosemite Valley. Attached to Savage's unit was Dr. [[Lafayette Bunnell]], the company physician, who later wrote about his awestruck impressions of the valley in ''The Discovery of the Yosemite''. Bunnell is credited with naming Yosemite Valley, based on his interviews with Chief Tenaya. Bunnell wrote that Chief Tenaya was the founder of the Ah-wah-nee colony.<ref name="Bunnell17">{{cite book|title=Discovery of the Yosemite and the Indian War of 1851 Which Led to That Event |last=Bunnell |first=Lafayette H. |url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/discovery_of_the_yosemite/17.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005171611/http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/discovery_of_the_yosemite/17.html |archivedate=October 5, 2012 |chapter=Chapter 17 |publisher=F.H.

Chief Tenaya and his Ahwahneechee were eventually captured and their village burned; they were removed to a [[Indian reservation|reservation]] near [[Fresno, California]]. The chief and some others were later allowed to return to Yosemite Valley. In the spring of 1852 they attacked a group of eight gold miners, and then moved east to flee law enforcement.<ref name="Schaffer46">{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|p=46}}</ref> Near Mono Lake, they took refuge with the nearby [[Mono tribe]] of Paiute. They stole horses from their hosts and moved away, but the Mono Paiutes tracked down and killed many of the Ahwahneechee, including Chief Tenaya. The Mono Paiute took the survivors as captives back to Mono Lake and absorbed them into the [[Mono Lake Paiute]] tribe.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

After these wars, a number of Native Americans continued to live within the boundaries of Yosemite. A number of Indians supported the growing tourism industry by working as laborers or maids. Later, Indians became part of the tourism industry itself by selling baskets or performing for tourists.<ref name="Spence">{{cite journal |last1=Spence |first1=Mark |title=Dispossesing the Wilderness: Yosemite Indians and the National Park Ideal, 1864–1930 |journal=Pacific Historical Review |date=1996 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=27–59 |doi=10.2307/3640826 |jstor=3640826 |issn=0030-8684}}</ref>

In 1855, entrepreneur [[James Mason Hutchings]], artist [[Thomas Ayres (artist)|Thomas Ayres]] and two others were the first to tour the area.<ref name="GeologyNP326"/> Hutchings and Ayres were responsible for much of the earliest publicity about Yosemite, writing articles and [[Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine|special magazine issues about the Valley]].{{sfn|Wuerthner|1994|p=20}} Ayres' style in art was highly detailed with exaggerated angularity. His works and written accounts were distributed nationally, and an art exhibition of his drawings was held in New York City. Hutchings' publicity efforts between 1855 and 1860 led to an increase in tourism to Yosemite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA96/RAILROAD/yosemite.html|title=Discovery and Invention in the Yosemite|work=The Role of Railroads in Protecting, Promoting, and Selling Yellowstone and Yosemite National Parks|first=J.S.|last=Johns|publisher=University of Virginia|year=1996}}</ref>

[[Wawona, California|Wawona]] was an Indian encampment in what is now the southwestern part of the park. Settler [[Galen Clark]] discovered the [[Mariposa Grove]] of [[giant sequoia]] in Wawona in 1857. He had simple lodgings built, and roads to the area. In 1879, the [[Wawona Hotel]] was built to serve tourists visiting Mariposa Grove. As tourism increased, so did the number of trails and hotels developed by people intending to build on the trade.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

The [[Wawona Tree]], also known as the Tunnel Tree, was a famous giant sequoia that stood in the Mariposa Grove. It was {{convert|227|ft|m}} tall, and was {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=on}} in circumference. When a carriage-wide tunnel was cut through the tree in 1881, it became even more popular as a tourist photo attraction. Everything from horse-drawn carriages in the late 19th century, to automobiles in the first part of the 20th century, traveled the road which passed through that tree. The tree was permanently weakened by the tunnel, and the Wawona Tree fell in 1969 under a heavy load of snow. It was estimated to have been 2,300 years old. It is unclear how much longer it may have lived if it had not been damaged.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

Yosemite's first concession was established in 1884 when John Degnan and his wife established a bakery and store.{{sfn|NPS|1989|p=58}} In 1916, the National Park Service granted a 20-year concession to the Desmond Park Service Company. It bought out or built hotels, stores, camps, a dairy, a garage, and other park services.{{sfn|Greene|1987|p=360}} Desmond changed its name to the Yosemite National Park Company in December 1917 and was reorganized in 1920.{{sfn|Greene|1987|pp=362, 364}}

The Curry Company had been started in 1899 by David and Jennie Curry to provide concessions in the park. They also founded Camp Curry, formerly known as Half Dome Village, now restored back to [[Curry Village, California|Curry Village]].{{sfn|Wuerthner|1994|p=40}} The Currys lobbied reluctant park supervisors to allow expansion of concession operations and development in the area.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

Administrators in the National Park Service felt that limiting the number of concessionaires in each national park would be more financially sound. The Curry Company and its rival, the Yosemite National Park Company, were forced to merge in 1925 to form the [[Yosemite Park & Curry Company]] (YP&CC).{{sfn|Greene|1987|p=387}} The company built the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]] in 1927.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

[[John Muir]] was a Scottish-born American naturalist and explorer. It was because of Muir that many National Parks were left untouched, such as Yosemite Valley National Park. One of the most significant camping trips Muir took was in 1903 with then president Theodore Roosevelt. This trip persuaded Roosevelt to return "Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove to federal protection as part of Yosemite National Park".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/nationalparks/people/historical/muir/|work=The National Parks: America's Best Idea|title=People&nbsp;– John Muir |publisher=PBS}}</ref>

Muir wrote articles popularizing the area and increasing scientific interest in it. Muir was one of the first to theorize that the major landforms in Yosemite Valley were created by large alpine glaciers, bucking established scientists such as [[Josiah Whitney]], who regarded Muir as an amateur.<ref name="Schaffer49">{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|p=49}}</ref> Muir wrote scientific papers on the area's biology.

Overgrazing of meadows (especially by sheep), logging of giant sequoia, and other damage caused Muir to become an advocate for further protection. Muir convinced prominent guests of the importance of putting the area under federal protection; one such guest was [[Robert Underwood Johnson]], editor of ''[[Century Magazine]]''. Muir and Johnson lobbied Congress for the Act that created Yosemite National Park on October 1, 1890.<ref name="Schaffer50">{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|p=50}}</ref> The State of California, however, retained control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. Muir also helped persuade local officials to virtually eliminate grazing from the Yosemite high country.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

The newly created national park came under the jurisdiction of the United States Army's Troop I of the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry]] on May 19, 1891, which set up camp in Wawona with Captain [[Abram Wood|Abram Epperson Wood]] as acting superintendent.<ref name="Schaffer50"/> By the late 1890s, sheep grazing was no longer a problem, and the Army made other improvements. The cavalry could not intervene to ease the worsening condition of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. The cavalry left another legacy in the park, the ranger hat. From 1899 to 1913, cavalry regiments of the Western Department, including the all Black [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry]] (known as the "Buffalo Soldiers") and the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry]], stationed two troops at Yosemite and brought with them the trooper's campaign hat with its distinctive Montana Peak we recognize today as the "ranger hat". This peak had been formed into the trooper's stetson by veterans of the 1898 Spanish–American War to better shed tropical rain.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

[[File:View of Tutocanula Pass Yosemite California by Carleton Watkins.jpg|thumb|[[Bridalveil Fall]] and [[El Capitan]], by [[Carleton Watkins]] (c. 1880)]]
Muir and his [[Sierra Club]] continued to lobby the government and influential people for the creation of a unified Yosemite National Park. In May 1903, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] camped with Muir near [[Glacier Point]] for three days. On that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove away from California and return it to the federal government. In 1906, Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

===National Park Service===
The [[National Park Service]] was formed in 1916, and Yosemite was transferred to that agency's jurisdiction. Tuolumne Meadows Lodge, [[Tioga Pass Road]], and campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes were also completed in 1916.<ref name="Schaffer52">{{harvnb|Schaffer|1999|p=52}}</ref> Automobiles started to enter the park in ever-increasing numbers following the construction of all-weather highways to the park. The Yosemite Museum was founded in 1926 through the efforts of [[Ansel Franklin Hall]].{{sfn|NPS|1989|p=117}} In the 1920s, the museum featured Native Americans practicing traditional crafts, and many of the Sierra Miwok continued to live in Yosemite Valley until they were evicted from Yosemite in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fresnobee.com/news/special-reports/yosemite-at-150/article19521750.html|title=American Indians share their Yosemite story|publisher=}}</ref>

In 1903, a dam in the northern portion of the park was proposed. Located in the [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]], its purpose was to provide water and [[hydroelectric power]] to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Muir and the Sierra Club opposed the project, while others, including [[Gifford Pinchot]], supported it.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Moseley |first=W.

In 1984, preservationists persuaded Congress to designate {{convert|677600|acre}}, or about 89% of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness—a highly protected [[wilderness area]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/legal/parklaws/1/laws1-volume1-appendix.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203175920/http://www.nps.gov/legal/parklaws/1/laws1-volume1-appendix.pdf |archivedate=February 3, 2012 |title=California Wilderness Act of 1984 |author=98th U.S. Congress |year=1984 |accessdate=May 8, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Park Service has reduced artificial inducements to visit the park, such as the ''[[Yosemite Firefall|Firefall]]'', in which red-hot embers were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point at night.

In 2016, [[The Trust for Public Land]] purchased Ackerson Meadow, a 400-acre tract on the western edge of Yosemite National Park, for $2.3&nbsp;million in order to preserve habitat and protect the area from development.  Ackerson Meadow was originally included in the proposed 1890 park boundary but never acquired by the federal government.  On September 7, 2016, the National Park Service accepted the donation of the land, making the meadow the largest addition to Yosemite since 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/news/ackersonaddition.htm|title=Ackerson Meadow Gifted to Yosemite National Park|author=National Park Service|accessdate=September 8, 2016}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of the Yosemite area}}
[[File:Yosemite National Park Map.png|thumb|upright|Park map]]
Yosemite National Park is located in the central Sierra Nevada of California. Three wilderness areas are adjacent to Yosemite: the [[Ansel Adams Wilderness]] to the southeast, the [[Hoover Wilderness]] to the northeast, and the [[Emigrant Wilderness]] to the north.

The {{convert|1189|mi2|km2|abbr=on}} park is roughly the size of the U.S. state of [[Rhode Island]] and contains thousands of lakes and ponds, {{convert|1600|mi|km}} of streams, {{convert|800|mi|km}} of hiking trails, and {{convert|350|mi|km}} of roads.<ref name="nature">{{cite web | title =Nature & Science | publisher =United States National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | url = http://www.nps.gov/yose/naturescience/index.htm | accessdate = January 27, 2007 }}</ref> Two federally designated [[Wild and Scenic River]]s, the [[Merced River|Merced]] and the Tuolumne, begin within Yosemite's borders and flow westward through the Sierra foothills, into the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley of California]]. On average, about 4&nbsp;million people visit the park each year,<ref name="visits"/> with most visitor use concentrated in the seven-square-mile (18&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) area of [[Yosemite Valley]].<ref name="nature"/>

===Rocks and erosion===
[[File:Yosemite Valley - El Capitan from Central Pillar of Frenzy - 2.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[El Capitan]], a granite monolith on Yosemite Valley's northern escarpment]]
Almost all of the landforms in the Yosemite area are cut from the granitic rock of the [[Sierra Nevada Batholith]] (a [[batholith]] is a large mass of intrusive [[igneous rock]] that formed deep below the surface).<ref name="GeologyNP329">{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=329}}</ref> About 5% of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near [[Mount Dana]]) are [[metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] [[volcanic rock|volcanic]] and [[sedimentary rock]]s.<ref name="landforms">{{cite web | publisher = United States National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/geo_landforms.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090514004436/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/geo_landforms.htm | archivedate = May 14, 2009 | title = Geology: The Making of the Landscape | date = December 22, 2004 | accessdate =January 27, 2007 }}</ref> These rocks are called ''[[roof pendants]]'' because they were once the roof of the underlying granitic rock.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=United States Geological Survey |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/geology/publications/pp/160/sec2a.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022231626/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/geology/publications/pp/160/sec2a.htm |archivedate=October 22, 2012 |title=Geological Survey Professional Paper 160: Geologic History of the Yosemite Valley&nbsp;– The Sierra Block |date=November 28, 2006 |accessdate=January 27, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Erosion]] acting upon different types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, [[dome (geology)|domes]], and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not [[fault (geology)|faults]].<ref name="GeologyNP331">{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=331}}</ref> Spacing between joints is controlled by the amount of [[silica]] in the granite and [[granodiorite]] rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.<ref name="GeologyUSP220">{{harvnb|Kiver|Harris|1999|p=220}}</ref>

Pillars and columns, such as [[Washington Column (Yosemite)|Washington Column]] and [[Lost Arrow Spire|Lost Arrow]], are created by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is responsible for creating valleys and later canyons.<ref name="GeologyUSP220"/> The single most erosive force over the last few million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). [[Exfoliation (geology)|Exfoliation]] (caused by the tendency of [[crystal]]s in [[pluton]]ic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as [[Half Dome]] and [[North Dome]] and inset arches like Royal Arches.<ref name="GeologyNP332"/>

Yosemite Valley represents only one percent of the park area, but this is where most visitors arrive and stay. The [[Tunnel View]] is the first view of the Valley for many visitors and is extensively photographed. [[El Capitan]], a prominent granite cliff that looms over Yosemite Valley, is one of the most popular rock climbing destinations in the world because of its diverse range of climbing routes in addition to its year-round accessibility. [[Granite dome]]s such as [[Sentinel Dome]] and [[Half Dome]] rise {{convert|3000|and|4800|ft|m}}, respectively, above the valley floor. In the park are [[Granite Domes of Yosemite National Park|many domes]].{{cn|date=November 2020}}

The high country of Yosemite contains beautiful areas such as [[Tuolumne Meadows]], [[Dana Meadows (California)|Dana Meadows]], the [[Clark Range (California)|Clark Range]], the [[Cathedral Range]], and the [[Kuna Crest]]. The Sierra crest and the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] run through Yosemite, with peaks of red metamorphic rock, such as Mount Dana and [[Mount Gibbs]], and granite peaks, such as [[Mount Conness]]. [[Mount Lyell (California)|Mount Lyell]] is the highest point in the park, standing at {{convert|13,120|ft|m}}.  The Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in Yosemite National Park and is one of the few remaining in the Sierra Nevada today.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

The park has three groves of ancient giant sequoia (''Sequoiadendron giganteum'') trees; the Mariposa Grove (200 trees), the [[Tuolumne Grove]] (25 trees), and the [[Merced Grove]] (20 trees).<ref name="GeologyNP340"/> This species grows larger in volume than any other and is one of the tallest and longest-lived.<ref name="Kiver227">{{harvnb|Kiver|Harris|1999|p=227}}</ref>

===Water and ice===
[[File:Valley View Yosemite August 2013 002.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Merced River]] flowing through [[Yosemite Valley]], a [[U-shaped valley]]]]
The Tuolumne and Merced River systems originate along the crest of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in the park and have carved river canyons {{convert|3000|to|4000|ft|m}} deep. The Tuolumne River drains the entire northern portion of the park, an area of approximately {{convert|680|mi2|km2}}. The Merced River begins in the park's southern peaks, primarily the Cathedral and Clark Ranges, and drains an area of approximately {{convert|511|mi2|km2}}.<ref name = "water overview">{{cite web | title = Water Overview | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/water.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107180730/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/water.htm|archivedate=January 7, 2007 | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | date = December 22, 2004 | accessdate = January 27, 2007 }}</ref>

Hydrologic processes, including [[glaciation]], flooding, and fluvial geomorphic response, have been fundamental in creating landforms in the park.<ref name = "water overview"/> The park also contains approximately 3,200 lakes (greater than 100 m<sup>2</sup>), two [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], and {{convert|1700|mi|km}} of streams, all of which help form these two large [[Drainage basin|watersheds]].<ref name = "hydrology">{{cite web | title = Hydrology and Watersheds | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wtr_hydrology.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100728075552/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wtr_hydrology.htm | archivedate = July 28, 2010 | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | date = December 22, 2004 | accessdate = January 27, 2007 }}</ref> [[Wetland]]s in Yosemite occur in valley bottoms throughout the park, and are often hydrologically linked to nearby lakes and rivers through seasonal flooding and groundwater movement.

[[File:Bridalveil Fall and valley.JPG|thumb|[[Bridalveil Fall]] flows from a U-shaped hanging valley that was created by a tributary glacier.]]
Yosemite is famous for its [[List of waterfalls in Yosemite National Park|high concentration of waterfalls]] in a small area. Numerous sheer drops, glacial steps and [[hanging valley]]s in the park provide many places for waterfalls to exist, especially during April, May, and June (the snowmelt season). Located in Yosemite Valley, the [[Yosemite Falls]] is the highest in North America at {{convert|2425|ft|m}}. Also in Yosemite Valley is the much lower volume [[Ribbon Fall]]s, which has the highest single vertical drop, {{convert|1612|ft|m}}.<ref name="Kiver227"/> Perhaps the most prominent of the Yosemite Valley waterfalls is [[Bridalveil Fall (Yosemite)|Bridalveil Fall]], which is the waterfall seen from the Tunnel View viewpoint at the east end of the Wawona Tunnel. Wapama Falls in Hetch Hetchy Valley is another notable waterfall. Hundreds of [[ephemeral]] waterfalls also exist in the park.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

All glaciers in the park are relatively small glaciers that occupy areas that are in almost permanent shade, such as north- and northeast-facing [[cirque (landform)|cirques]]. [[Lyell Glacier]] is the largest glacier in Yosemite (the Palisades Glaciers are the largest in the Sierra Nevada) and covers {{convert|160|acre}}.<ref name="GeologyUSP228">{{harvnb|Kiver|Harris|1999|p=228}}</ref> None of the Yosemite glaciers are a remnant of the much, much larger [[Ice Age]] alpine glaciers responsible for sculpting the Yosemite landscape. Instead, they were formed during one of the [[neoglacial]] episodes that have occurred since the thawing of the Ice Age (such as the [[Little Ice Age]]).<ref name="GeologyNP340">{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=340}}</ref> [[Climate change]] has reduced the number and size of glaciers around the world. Many Yosemite glaciers, including Merced Glacier, which was discovered by John Muir in 1871 and bolstered his glacial origins theory of the Yosemite area, have disappeared and most of the others have lost up to 75% of their surface area.<ref name="GeologyUSP228"/>

===Climate===
[[File:El Capitan at fall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Yosemite in [[autumn]]]]
Yosemite has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''), meaning most precipitation falls during the mild winter, and the other seasons are nearly dry (less than 3% of precipitation falls during the long, hot summers).<ref name="Wuerthner8">{{harvnb|Wuerthner|1994|p=8}}</ref> Because of [[orographic lift]], precipitation increases with elevation up to {{convert|8000|ft|m}} where it slowly decreases to the crest. Precipitation amounts vary from {{convert|36|in|mm}} at {{convert|4000|ft|m}} elevation to {{convert|50|in|mm}} at {{convert|8600|ft|m}}. Snow does not typically persist on the ground until November in the high country. It accumulates all winter and into March or early April.<ref name="climate">{{cite web | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wtr_climate.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101113353/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wtr_climate.htm|archivedate=January 1, 2007 | title = Climate | date = December 22, 2004 | accessdate = January 27, 2007 }}</ref>

Mean daily temperatures range from {{convert|25|°F|0}} to {{convert|53|°F|0}} at Tuolumne Meadows at {{convert|8600|ft|m}}. At the Wawona Entrance (elevation {{convert|5130|ft|m|disp=or}}), mean daily temperature ranges from {{convert|36|to|67|°F|°C}}. At the lower elevations below {{convert|5000|ft|m}}, temperatures are hotter; the mean daily high temperature at Yosemite Valley (elevation {{convert|3966|ft|m|disp=or}}) varies from {{convert|46|to|90|°F|°C}}. At elevations above {{convert|8000|ft|m}}, the hot, dry summer temperatures are moderated by frequent summer thunderstorms, along with snow that can persist into July. The combination of dry vegetation, low relative humidity, and thunderstorms results in frequent lightning-caused [[wildfire|fires]] as well.<ref name="climate"/>

===Tectonic and volcanic activity===
[[File:Map of Yosemite National Park.svg|thumb|Generalized geologic map of the Yosemite area (based on a [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] image)]]
The area of the park was astride a [[passive continental margin]] during the [[Precambrian]] and early [[Paleozoic]].<ref name="GeologyNP328"/> Sediment was derived from continental sources and was deposited in shallow water. These rocks have since been deformed and metamorphosed.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Review of Late Jurassic-early Miocene sedimentationand plate-tectonic evolution of northern California: illuminatingexample of an accretionary margin|first=WG|last=Ernst|journal=Chin.

Heat generated from the [[Farallon Plate]] [[subduction|subducting]] below the [[North American Plate]] led to the creation of an [[island arc]] of volcanoes on the west coast of proto-North America between the late [[Devonian]] and [[Permian]] periods.<ref name="GeologyNP328">{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=328}}</ref> Later volcanism in the [[Jurassic]] intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with the early stages of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

The first phase of regional [[intrusion (geology)|plutonism]] started 210&nbsp;million years ago in the late Triassic and continued throughout the Jurassic to about 150&nbsp;million years before present ([[Before Present|BP]]).<ref name="GeologyNP329"/> Around the same time, the [[Nevadan orogeny]] built the Nevadan mountain range (also called the Ancestral Sierra Nevada) to a height of {{convert|15000|ft|m}}. This was directly part of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith, and the resulting rocks were mostly granitic in composition and emplaced about {{convert|6|mi|km}} below the surface.<ref name="GeologyNP337">{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=337}}</ref> The second major pluton emplacement phase lasted from about 120&nbsp;million to 80&nbsp;million years ago during the [[Cretaceous]].<ref name="GeologyNP329"/> This was part of the [[Sevier orogeny]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yonkee|first1=W. Adolph|last2=Weil|first2=Arlo Brandon|date=2015-11-01|title=Tectonic evolution of the Sevier and Laramide belts within the North American Cordillera orogenic system|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825215300258|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|language=en|volume=150|pages=531–593|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2015.08.001|bibcode=2015ESRv..150..531Y|issn=0012-8252}}</ref>

Starting 20&nbsp;million years ago (in the [[Cenozoic]]) and lasting until 5&nbsp;million years ago, a now-extinct extension of [[Cascade Range]] volcanoes erupted, bringing large amounts of igneous material in the area. These igneous deposits blanketed the region north of the Yosemite region. Volcanic activity persisted past 5&nbsp;million years BP east of the current park borders in the Mono Lake and [[Long Valley Caldera|Long Valley]] areas.<ref>{{cite book|title = Geology of the Sierra Nevada|last = Hill|first = Mary|location = Berkeley, California|publisher = University of California Press|year = 2006|page=270}}</ref>

===Uplift and erosion===
[[File:Half Dome from Glacier Point, Yosemite NP - Diliff.jpg|thumb|[[Exfoliation joint]]s cause erosion in granitic rocks, creating many [[Granite dome|domes]] including [[Half Dome]].]]
Starting 10&nbsp;million years ago, vertical movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block and the resulting accelerated uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the [[gradient]] of western-flowing streams.<ref name="GeologyNP339">{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=339}}</ref> The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of [[Owens Valley]] from [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]]-associated extensional forces. Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the [[Pleistocene]].{{cn|date=September 2020}}

The uplifting and increased erosion exposed granitic rocks in the area to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons.<ref name="GeologyNP332">{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=332}}</ref> Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process and the larger ones transported the resulting [[scree|talus]] and [[till]] from valley floors.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

Numerous vertical joint planes controlled where and how fast erosion took place. Most of these long, linear and very deep cracks trend northeast or northwest and form parallel, often regularly spaced sets. They were created by uplift-associated pressure release and by the unloading of overlying rock via erosion.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

===Sculpting by glaciers===
[[File:Glacially polished granite.jpg|thumbnail|Glacially polished granite [[cirque]] in upper [[Tenaya Canyon]]]]
A series of glaciations further modified the region starting about 2 to 3&nbsp;million years ago and ending sometime around 10,000 BP. At least four major glaciations have occurred in the Sierra Nevada, locally called the Sherwin (also called the pre-Tahoe), Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga.<ref name="GeologyNP339"/> The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost surely responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

Glacial systems reached depths of up to {{convert|4000|ft|m}} and left their marks in the Yosemite area. The longest glacier in the Yosemite area ran down the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne River for {{convert|60|mi|km}}, passing well beyond Hetch Hetchy Valley. Merced Glacier flowed out of Yosemite Valley and into the Merced River Gorge. Lee Vining Glacier carved Lee Vining Canyon and emptied into Lake Russel (the much-enlarged ice age version of Mono Lake). Only the highest peaks, such as Mount Dana and Mount Conness, were not covered by glaciers. Retreating glaciers often left recessional [[moraine]]s that impounded lakes such as the {{convert|5.5|mi|km|0}} long Lake Yosemite (a shallow lake that periodically covered much of the floor of Yosemite Valley).<ref name="GeologyNP333">{{harvnb|Harris|1998|p=333}}</ref>

Much of Yosemite's western boundary has habitats dominated by [[mixed coniferous forest]]s of [[ponderosa pine]], [[sugar pine]], [[incense cedar]], [[white fir]], [[Douglas fir]], and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of [[California black oak|black oak]] and [[Live oak|canyon live oak]]. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include [[American black bear|black bear]], [[coyote]], raccoon, [[Kingsnake|mountain kingsnake]], [[Gilbert's skink]], [[white-headed woodpecker]], [[bobcat]], [[North American river otter|river otter]], [[gray fox]], [[red fox]], [[brown creeper]], two species of skunk, [[North American cougar|cougar]], [[spotted owl]], and a wide variety of bat species.<ref name="wildlife"/>

Going higher in elevation, the coniferous forests become purer stands of [[Fir|red fir]], [[western white pine]], [[Jeffrey pine]], [[lodgepole pine]], and the occasional [[foxtail pine]]. Fewer wildlife species tend to be found in these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include [[golden-mantled ground squirrel]], [[chickaree]], [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[Steller's jay]], [[hermit thrush]], and [[northern goshawk]]. Reptiles are not common, but include [[rubber boa]], [[western fence lizard]], and [[northern alligator lizard]].<ref name = "wildlife"/>

[[File:Marmota flaviventris (Yellow Bellied Marmot), Yosemite NP - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yellow-bellied marmot|Marmot]] in [[Tuolumne Meadows]]]]
As the landscape rises, trees become smaller and more sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, [[whitebark pine]], and [[mountain hemlock]] that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as [[American pika|pika]], [[yellow-bellied marmot]], white-tailed [[jackrabbit]], [[Clark's nutcracker]], and [[black rosy finch]] are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by [[Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep]]. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.<ref name = "wildlife"/>

At a variety of elevations, meadows provide important, productive habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green [[Poaceae|grasses]] and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include [[great grey owl]], [[willow flycatcher]], [[Yosemite toad]], and [[mountain beaver]].<ref name = "wildlife"/>

===Management issues===
[[File:YosemiteBlackBearTagged wb.jpg|thumb|A [[American black bear|black bear]] with an ear tag in Yosemite Valley]]
The black bears of Yosemite were once famous for breaking into parked cars to steal food. They were also an encouraged tourist sight for many years at the park's garbage dumps, where bears congregated to eat park visitors' garbage and tourists gathered to photograph the bears. Increasing encounters between bears and humans and increasing damage to property led to an aggressive campaign to discourage bears from relying on human food or interacting with people and their property. The open-air dumps were closed; all trash receptacles were replaced with [[bear-resistant food storage container|bear-proof]] receptacles; all campgrounds were equipped with bear-proof food lockers so that people would not leave food in their vehicles, which were easy targets for the powerful and resourceful bears. Because bears who show aggression towards people usually are eventually destroyed, park personnel have continued to come up with innovative ways to have bears associate humans and their property with unpleasant experiences, such as being hit with [[rubber bullet]]s. Today,{{when|date=November 2020}} about 30 bears a year are captured and [[ear tag|ear-tagged]] and their [[DNA]] is sampled so that, when bear damage occurs, rangers can ascertain which bear is causing the problem.<ref>{{cite magazine | url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/04/0423_wirebears.html | title= DNA to Help Identify "Problem" Bears at Yosemite | magazine= National Geographic | date = April 23, 2001 | accessdate=January 4, 2007}}</ref>{{needs update|date=November 2020}}

Despite the richness of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the [[brown bear]], [[California condor]], and [[least Bell's vireo]] have become extinct in the park within historical time,<ref name = "snepTerrestrialVertebrates">{{Cite book | first = David M. | last = Graber | chapter = 25: Status of Terrestrial Vertebrates | year = 1996 | pages = 709–734 | title = Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project.

The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, [[exotic species]], air pollution, [[habitat fragmentation]], and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as [[road kill]]s and the availability of human food have affected some wildlife species.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

[[File:Yellow star thistle.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|The [[Centaurea solstitialis|yellow star thistle]] competes with Yosemite's native plants.{{cn|date=November 2020}}]]
Yosemite National Park has documented more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following the migration of early [[European colonization of the Americas|Euro-American]] settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause an increase in the fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as [[Centaurea solstitialis|yellow star thistle]] (''Centaurea solstitialis''), are able to produce a long [[tap root]] that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.<ref name = "exotic">{{cite web | url= http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/veg_exotics.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102234435/http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/veg_exotics.htm|archivedate=January 2, 2007 | title= Exotic Plants | date = December 22, 2004| publisher= National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | accessdate= January 4, 2007 }}</ref>

Bull thistle (''[[Cirsium vulgare]]''), common mullein (''[[Verbascum thapsus]]''), and Klamath weed (''[[Hypericum perforatum]]'') have been identified as noxious [[pest (organism)|pests]] in Yosemite since the 1940s. Additional species that have been recognized more recently as aggressive and requiring control are yellow star thistle (''Centaurea solstitialis''), sweet clover (''[[Melilot]]'' spp.), Himalayan blackberry (''[[Rubus armeniacus]]''), cut-leaved blackberry (''[[Rubus laciniatus]]'') and large periwinkle (''[[Vinca major]]'').<ref name = "exotic"/>

Increasing [[ozone]] pollution is causing tissue damage to the massive giant sequoia trees in the park, making them more vulnerable to insect infestation and disease. Since the [[conifer cone|cones]] of these trees require fire-touched soil to [[germination|germinate]], historic [[Wildfire#Suppression|fire suppression]] has reduced these trees' ability to reproduce. The current policy of setting [[prescribed fire]]s is expected to help the germination issue.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

==Activities==
[[File:Yosemite shuttlebus.jpg|thumb|left|Yosemite [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] shuttle, a free [[Public transport bus service|bus service]]]]
Yosemite Valley is open year-round and numerous activities are available through the [[National Park Service]], Yosemite Conservancy, and [[Aramark]] at Yosemite, including nature walks, photography and art classes, stargazing programs, tours, bike rentals, rafting, mule and horseback rides, and rock climbing classes. Many people enjoy short walks and longer hikes to waterfalls in Yosemite Valley, or walks among giant sequoias in the Mariposa, Tuolumne, or Merced Groves. Others like to drive or take a tour bus to Glacier Point (summer–fall) to see views of Yosemite Valley and the high country, or drive along the scenic [[Tioga Road]] to Tuolumne Meadows (May–October) and go for a walk or hike.

Most park visitors stay just for the day, and visit only those locations within Yosemite Valley that are easily accessible by automobile. There is a [[United States dollar|US$]]25–30 per automobile user fee to enter the park, depending on the season.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/feesandreservations.htm | title = Fees and Reservations}} National Park Service: Yosemite National Park.
