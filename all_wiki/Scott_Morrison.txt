He was elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 election]], representing the [[Division of Cook]] in New South Wales.

After the Coalition's victory at the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 election]], Morrison was appointed [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection]] in the [[Abbott Government]], in which capacity he was responsible for implementing [[Operation Sovereign Borders]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=16 September 2013 |title=Tony Abbott's cabinet and outer ministry |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbotts-cabinet-and-outer-ministry-20130916-2tuma.html |url-status=live |access-date=16 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806191147/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbotts-cabinet-and-outer-ministry-20130916-2tuma.html |archive-date=6 August 2017}}</ref> In a reshuffle the following year, he became [[Minister for Social Services (Australia)|Minister for Social Services]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 December 2014 |title=Dutton to immigration in reshuffle |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/pm-set-for-cabinet-reshuffle/story-e6frfku9-1227163296745 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016143017/http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/pm-set-for-cabinet-reshuffle/story-e6frfku9-1227163296745 |archive-date=16 October 2015 |access-date=21 December 2014 |website=[[News.com.au]]}}</ref> He was later promoted to the role of Treasurer in September 2015, after [[Malcolm Turnbull]] replaced Abbott as prime minister.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Murphy |first=Katharine |date=20 September 2015 |title=Malcolm Turnbull unveils his ministry |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2015/sep/20/malcolm-turnbull-unveils-his-ministry-politics-live |url-status=live |access-date=20 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920170740/http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2015/sep/20/malcolm-turnbull-unveils-his-ministry-politics-live |archive-date=20 September 2015}}</ref>

In August 2018, Home Affairs Minister [[Peter Dutton]] unsuccessfully challenged Turnbull for the leadership of the Liberal Party. Leadership tension continued, and the party voted to hold [[2018 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills|a second leadership ballot]] on 24 August, with Turnbull choosing not to stand. In that ballot, Morrison was seen as a compromise candidate and defeated both Dutton and Foreign Minister [[Julie Bishop]] to become leader of the Liberal Party.

== Early career ==
After graduating from university, Morrison worked as national policy and research manager for the [[Property Council of Australia]] from 1989 to 1995. He then moved into tourism, serving as Deputy Chief Executive of the Australian Tourism Task Force and then general manager of the Tourism Council of Australia; the latter was managed by [[Bruce Baird]], whom he would eventually succeed in federal parliament.<ref name="rise" />

In 1998, Morrison moved to New Zealand to become director of the newly created Office of Tourism and Sport. He formed a close relationship with New Zealand's [[Minister of Tourism (New Zealand)|tourism minister]], [[Murray McCully]], and was involved with the creation of the long-running "[[Tourism New Zealand#100% Pure New Zealand|100% Pure New Zealand]]" campaign.<ref name="rise" /><ref name="rnz2018">{{cite web |url= https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/world/364867/scott-morrison-s-rise-to-australia-s-top-job |title=Scott Morrison's rise to Australia's top job |date=24 August 2018 |website=[[Radio New Zealand]] |agency=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824091842/https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/world/364867/scott-morrison-s-rise-to-australia-s-top-job |archive-date=24 August 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref> He left this position in 2000, a year before the contract schedule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/labor-puts-scott-morrisons-past-performance-in-senior-executive-roles-under-the-spotlight/news-story/94b7a8794eec7b7ccbe00ea6118f63b9|title=Labor is probing Scott Morrison’s past life in the tourism industry|date=2018-11-14|website=NewsComAu|access-date=2019-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821013653/https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/labor-puts-scott-morrisons-past-performance-in-senior-executive-roles-under-the-spotlight/news-story/94b7a8794eec7b7ccbe00ea6118f63b9|archive-date=21 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Morrison returned to Australia in 2000, to become state director of the [[Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division)]]. He oversaw the party's campaigns in the [[2001 Australian federal election|2001 federal election]] and in the [[2003 New South Wales state election]].<ref name="bryant" />
===Tourism Australia ===
In 2004, Morrison left the NSW Liberal Party post to become the inaugural managing director of [[Tourism Australia]], which had been established by the [[Howard Government]]. His appointment was controversial due to its openly political nature.<ref name="bryant" /> He signed an initial three-year contract.<ref name=middleton>{{cite news |url=https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2019/06/08/fresh-documents-morrisons-sacking/15599160008252# |title=Fresh documents in Morrison’s sacking |author=Karen Middleton |newspaper=[[The Saturday Paper]] |date=8 June 2019 |access-date=25 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617122714/https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2019/06/08/fresh-documents-morrisons-sacking/15599160008252 |archive-date=17 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Morrison approved and defended the contentious "[[So where the bloody hell are you?]]" advertising campaign featuring [[Lara Bingle]].

A 2019 investigation by ''[[The Saturday Paper]]'' suggested Morrison was sacked due to concerns that Tourism Australia was not following government procurement guidelines for three contracts relating to the "So where the bloody hell are you?" campaign, with a total value of $184 million. A 2008 report from the [[Auditor-General of Australia|Auditor-General]] found that "information had been kept from the board, procurement guidelines breached and private companies engaged before paperwork was signed and without appropriate value-for-money assessments". It was suggested that [[M&C Saatchi]], which had previously worked with Morrison on the "100% Pure" campaign in New Zealand, received favourable treatment in the tendering process.<ref name=middleton/>

==Political career==

Morrison sought Liberal [[preselection]] for the [[Division of Cook]], an electorate in the southern suburbs of Sydney which includes [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]], [[Caringbah]], and [[Miranda, New South Wales|Miranda]], for the 2007 election, following the retirement of [[Bruce Baird]], who had served as the member since 1998.

In September 2008, Morrison was appointed to [[Malcolm Turnbull]]'s [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]] front bench as shadow minister for housing and local government. In December 2009, he became shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, coming into the shadow cabinet for the first time during [[Tony Abbott]]'s first cabinet reshuffle shortly after winning the leadership. He served on the Shadow Cabinet Committee on Border Protection.

During his time as Immigration Minister, Morrison's dealings with the media and accountability to the public were widely criticised by journalists, Labor and Greens senators, and others for refusing to provide details about the matters within his portfolio.

In November 2014, the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] delivered a report to the Government which found that Morrison failed in his responsibility to act in the best interests of children in detention during his time as Minister.

The bill gave Morrison more power than any previous minister in dealing with people seeking asylum in Australia, including the power to return asylum seekers to their place of origin, detain asylum seekers without charge, and refuse asylum seekers who arrive by boat access to the Refugee Review Tribunal.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Doherty|first1=Ben|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/05/senate-gives-scott-morrison-unchecked-control-over-asylum-seekers-lives|title=Senate gives Scott Morrison unchecked control over asylum seekers’ lives|accessdate=8 December 2014|work=The Guardian|location=Australia|date=5 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208021521/http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/05/senate-gives-scott-morrison-unchecked-control-over-asylum-seekers-lives|archive-date=8 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Morton|first1=Adam|url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/sunday-explainer-the-unprecedented-immigration-powers-awarded-to-scott-morrison-20141206-121lo6.html|title=The unprecedented immigration powers awarded to Scott Morrison|accessdate=8 December 2014|work=[[The Age]]|date=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111094103/http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/sunday-explainer-the-unprecedented-immigration-powers-awarded-to-scott-morrison-20141206-121lo6.html|archive-date=11 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The bill reintroduced [[temporary protection visa]]s to deal specifically with the backlog of 30,000 people who had arrived under the previous Labor Government but who had yet to be processed.

=== Turnbull Government (2015–2018) ===
Morrison was appointed as Treasurer in the [[Turnbull Government]] in September 2015, replacing [[Joe Hockey]]. In his first press conference as Treasurer, he indicated a reduction in government expenditure and stated that the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) and [[White Paper]] on tax reform would arrive on time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-23/government-says-they-have-a-spending-problem/6798110|title=Treasurer Scott Morrison says Federal Government has 'spending problem'; expenditure the same as during GFC – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|publisher=Abc.net.au|date=|accessdate=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182340/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-23/government-says-they-have-a-spending-problem/6798110|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2016, Morrison handed down the [[2016 Australian federal budget]]. It included the introduction of a 40 percent diverted profits tax (popularly known as the "[[Google tax]]"), which is an [[anti-avoidance]] measure designed to prevent [[base erosion and profit shifting]]. It was passed into law as the ''Diverted Profits Tax Act 2017'' and took effect on 1 July 2017.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ato.gov.au/general/new-legislation/in-detail/direct-taxes/income-tax-for-businesses/diverted-profits-tax/?=redirected |title=Diverted profits tax |publisher=Australian Taxation Office |access-date=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827210018/https://www.ato.gov.au/general/new-legislation/in-detail/direct-taxes/income-tax-for-businesses/diverted-profits-tax/?=redirected |archive-date=27 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The new tax received criticism from some quarters, with the Corporate Tax Association stating that it would have "unpredictable outcomes" and negatively affect Australian business.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.afr.com/opinion/columnists/diverted-profits-tax-will-go-nowhere-20170328-gv8h8r |title=Diverted profits tax will go nowhere |newspaper=[[The Australian Financial Review]] |date=28 March 2017 |access-date=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828001746/https://www.afr.com/opinion/columnists/diverted-profits-tax-will-go-nowhere-20170328-gv8h8r |archive-date=28 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/treasurer-to-launch-fresh-attack-on-multinational-tax-avoidance-as-parliament-resumes-20170318-gv111v.html|title=Treasurer to launch fresh attack on multinational tax avoidance as Parliament resumes|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 March 2017|access-date=27 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827210011/https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/treasurer-to-launch-fresh-attack-on-multinational-tax-avoidance-as-parliament-resumes-20170318-gv111v.html|archive-date=27 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 2017, Morrison addressed the House of Representatives while holding a lump of [[coal]], stating "This is coal. Don't be afraid. Don't be scared. It won't hurt you," and accusing those concerned about the [[environmental impact of the coal industry]] of having "an ideological, pathological fear of coal."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2017/feb/09/scott-morrison-brings-a-chunk-of-coal-into-parliament-video|title=Scott Morrison brings a chunk of coal into parliament|work=The Guardian|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=29 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329143512/https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2017/feb/09/scott-morrison-brings-a-chunk-of-coal-into-parliament-video|archive-date=29 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> He handed down the [[2017 Australian federal budget]] in May 2017.

Morrison was an opponent of legalising [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|same-sex marriage]].

In December 2017, the government introduced the [[Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry]] (popularly known as the Banking Royal Commission). Morrison originally opposed the creation of a [[royal commission]], believing that a Senate inquiry would be sufficient. He voted against a royal commission 23 times between April 2016 and June 2017, and in September 2016 described it as "nothing more than crass populism seeking to undermine confidence in the banking and financial system, which is key to jobs and growth in this country."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/does-royal-commission-turncoat-scott-morrison-really-think-the-public-is-so-dim-20180420-p4zarf.html|title=Does royal commission turncoat Scott Morrison really think the public is so dim?|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 April 2018|access-date=27 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827174145/https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/does-royal-commission-turncoat-scott-morrison-really-think-the-public-is-so-dim-20180420-p4zarf.html|archive-date=27 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In announcing that the royal commission would take place, Morrison described it as a "regrettable but necessary action."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/how-scott-morrison-changed-his-tune-on-the-banking-royal-commission-20180420-p4zaoa.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 April 2018|access-date=27 August 2018|title=How Scott Morrison changed his tune on the banking royal commission|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005071903/https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/how-scott-morrison-changed-his-tune-on-the-banking-royal-commission-20180420-p4zaoa.html|archive-date=5 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In response to the commission's findings, in April 2018 he announced the introduction of new criminal and civil penalties for financial misconduct, including potential prison sentences of 10 years for individuals and fines of up to $210 million for companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-20/corporate-crooks-set-to-face-tougher-penalties/9677792|date=20 April 2018|access-date=27 August 2018|publisher=ABC News|title=Corporate crooks to face tougher penalties under new rules to be revealed by Government|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827095109/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-20/corporate-crooks-set-to-face-tougher-penalties/9677792|archive-date=27 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] called a [[leadership spill]] on 21 August 2018 in order to gauge the confidence of the Liberal Party in his leadership. He defeated challenger [[Peter Dutton]] by 48 votes to 35. Over the following days, there was repeated speculation about a second spill being called, without Turnbull's approval. Turnbull announced two days later that he would resign the leadership if a spill motion were passed. Dutton, Morrison and [[Julie Bishop]] announced they would stand for the leadership if that were the case.

A spill motion was passed on 24 August by 45 votes to 40, and Turnbull did not run as a candidate in the resulting leadership vote. On the first ballot, Dutton received 38 votes, Morrison 36 votes, and Bishop 11 votes. On the second ballot, Morrison received 45 votes and Dutton 40 votes. He thus became leader of the Liberal Party and prime minister-designate. [[Josh Frydenberg]] was elected as the party's deputy leader, in place of Bishop.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scott Morrison wins Liberal party leadership spill|url=https://www.9news.com.au/2018/08/23/13/57/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-scott-morrison|publisher=9News|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824070923/https://www.9news.com.au/2018/08/23/13/57/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-scott-morrison|archive-date=24 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-45292637|title=Australia PM Turnbull ousted in party coup|date=24 August 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=24 August 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824045629/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-45292637|archive-date=24 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Morrison was widely seen as a compromise candidate, who was agreeable to both the moderate supporters of Turnbull and Bishop and conservatives concerned about Dutton's electability.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/22/could-scott-morrison-and-julie-bishop-join-the-leadership-race-in-a-three-cornered-contest|title=Could Scott Morrison and Julie Bishop join the leadership race in a three-cornered contest?|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 August 2018|access-date=24 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823100346/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/22/could-scott-morrison-and-julie-bishop-join-the-leadership-race-in-a-three-cornered-contest|archive-date=23 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> He was sworn in as prime minister on the evening of 24 August.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/scott-morrison-sworn-in-as-prime-minister-but-policy-direction-and-election-strategy-remains-uncertain-20180824-p4zznd.html|title=Scott Morrison sworn in as Prime Minister but policy direction and election strategy remains uncertain|access-date=25 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824191917/https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/scott-morrison-sworn-in-as-prime-minister-but-policy-direction-and-election-strategy-remains-uncertain-20180824-p4zznd.html|archive-date=24 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/scott-morrison-sworn-in-as-prime-minister-20180824-57ief.html|title=Scott Morrison sworn in as Prime Minister|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=27 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824183412/https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/scott-morrison-sworn-in-as-prime-minister-20180824-57ief.html|archive-date=24 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
