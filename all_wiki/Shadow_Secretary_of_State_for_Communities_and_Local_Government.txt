The '''Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government''' is a position with the [[UK Opposition]]'s [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]]; if the opposition party forms a new government, the designated person is a likely choice to become the new [[Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government|Communities Secretary]].

The position has existed in many iterations, first as '''Environment, Transport and the Regions''' in 1997 after the Government's reorganisation. The portfolio shifted among government departments for many years until resting on its current name in 2006.

Under [[Michael Howard]], the arrangement was slightly different. There was a Shadow Secretary of State for Local and Devolved Government Affairs in Shadow Cabinet who supervised a Shadow Local Government Secretary and a Shadow Regions Secretary outside of it.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/nov/10/conservatives.uk2 Full list: the shadow cabinet]</ref>

The current Shadow Communities Secretary is [[Steve Reed (politician)|Steve Reed]] who succeeded [[Andrew Gwynne]] in April 2020. Following the [[2018 British cabinet reshuffle]], [[Theresa May]] added [[Housing in England]] to the portfolio. However, the [[Shadow Cabinet of Jeremy Corbyn]], has a Shadow Communities Secretary, along with a separate [[Shadow Secretary of State for Housing]], as Corbyn has indicated that if Labour form the next government, they will create a separate [[government department]] for housing; a practise continued by [[Sir Keir Starmer]].
