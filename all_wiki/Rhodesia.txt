<!-- The flags are in the correct order, with the second flag of the Republic of Rhodesia -- that existed for 80% of the existence of "Rhodesia" -- given prominence because the Republic of Rhodesia is really what this article is about, and it was the flag of the country when the country ceased to exist. The other flag, while the "first" flag, was almost unknown outside of Rhodesia (and the UK) and it makes no sense to give it prominence over the flag of the Republic of Rhodesia. To make an analogy, it would be like making the flag in the article on the United Kingdom the flag of Great Britain of 1606/1707 (without St. Patrick's Cross), or the flag of the United States article the old Betsy Ross flag with thirteen stars in a circle. If you disagree with this, please take it to the talk page where this can be discussed, and where there is already a section addressing it. -->

'''Rhodesia''' ({{IPAc-en|r|əʊ|ˈ|d|iː|ʒ|ə|}}, {{IPAc-en|r|əʊ|ˈ|d|iː|ʃ|ə|}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC&pg=PA1416|title=The Chambers Dictionary|last=Chambers|first=Allied|date=1998|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-81-86062-25-8|page=1416}}</ref>) was an [[List of historical unrecognized states and dependencies|unrecognised state]] in [[southern Africa]] from 1965 to 1979, equivalent in territory to modern [[Zimbabwe]]. Rhodesia was the ''de facto'' [[successor state]] to the [[British colony]] of [[Southern Rhodesia]], which had been [[Self-governing colony|self-governing]] since achieving [[responsible government]] in 1923. A [[landlocked]] nation, Rhodesia was bordered by [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] to the south, [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]] (later [[Botswana]]) to the southwest, [[Zambia]] to the northwest, and [[Mozambique]] ([[Portuguese Mozambique|a Portuguese province]] until 1975) to the east. 

In the late 19th century, the territory north of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] was [[Royal charter|chartered]] to the [[British South Africa Company]], led by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Rhodes and his [[Pioneer Column]] marched north in 1890, acquiring a huge block of territory that [[Company rule in Rhodesia|the company would rule]] until the early 1920s. In 1923, the company's charter was revoked, and Southern Rhodesia attained self-government and established a [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly|legislature]]. Between 1953 and 1963, Southern Rhodesia was joined with [[Northern Rhodesia]] and [[Nyasaland]] in the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]].

The [[decolonisation of Africa]] in the early 1960s alarmed a significant proportion of Rhodesia's [[White people in Zimbabwe|white]] population. In an effort to delay the transition to [[No independence before majority rule|black majority rule]], Rhodesia's predominantly [[Whites in Zimbabwe|white]] government issued its own [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] (UDI) from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965.  (The government of the United Kingdom supported Rhodesia's transition to a multiracial democracy.) The UDI administration initially sought [[Diplomatic recognition|recognition]] as an autonomous [[Commonwealth realm|realm]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but reconstituted itself as a republic in 1970. The [[Rhodesian Bush War]], which pitted the government against two [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] organisations, [[Zimbabwe African National Union|ZANU]] and [[Zimbabwe African People's Union|ZAPU]], intensified in the 1970s, prompting Rhodesian premier [[Ian Smith]] to concede to multiracial democracy in 1978. However, a [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia|provisional government]] subsequently headed by Smith and his moderate colleague [[Abel Muzorewa]] failed to appease international critics or halt the bloodshed. By December 1979, Muzorewa had replaced Smith as [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Prime Minister]] and secured an [[Lancaster House Agreement|agreement]] with the militant nationalists, allowing Rhodesia to briefly revert to colonial status pending elections under a [[Universal suffrage|universal franchise]]. It finally achieved internationally recognised independence in April 1980 as the [[Zimbabwe|Republic of Zimbabwe]].

Rhodesia's largest cities were [[Harare|Salisbury]] (its capital city, now known as Harare) and [[Bulawayo]]. The white population, which grew to nearly 300,000, dominated the country's politics and economy, though they never made up more than 8% of the total population. Rhodesia developed an economy largely dependent on agriculture, manufacturing, and mining. Its largest exports were [[chromium]], [[tobacco]], and [[steel]]. International [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] put increasing pressure on the country as time went on. The unicameral [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] was predominantly white by law, although a small minority of seats was reserved for blacks as a result of reforms made in 1958. Following the declaration of a republic in 1970, this was replaced by a bicameral [[Politics of Rhodesia|Parliament]] with a [[House of Assembly (Zimbabwe)|House of Assembly]] and a [[Senate of Zimbabwe|Senate]]. The [[Westminster system]] was retained, with the [[President of Rhodesia|President]] acting as ceremonial head of state, and the [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Prime Minister]], heading the [[Cabinet of Rhodesia|Cabinet]], as head of government.

==Name==

The official name of the country, according to the constitution adopted concurrently with the UDI in 1965, was Rhodesia. This was not the case under [[British law]], however, which considered the territory's legal name to be Southern Rhodesia, the name given to the country in 1898 during the [[British South Africa Company]]'s [[Company rule in Rhodesia|administration]] of [[Rhodesia (region)|the Rhodesias]], and retained by the [[self-governing colony]] of Southern Rhodesia after the end of company rule in 1923.<ref name=rowland251/>

This naming dispute dated back to October 1964, when [[Northern Rhodesia]] became independent from the UK and concurrently changed its name to [[Zambia]]. The Southern Rhodesian colonial government in [[Harare|Salisbury]] felt that in the absence of a "Northern" Rhodesia, the continued use of "Southern" was superfluous. It passed legislation to become simply Rhodesia, but the British government refused to approve this on the grounds that the country's name was defined by British legislation, so could not be altered by the colonial government. [[Harare|Salisbury]] went on using the shortened name in an official manner nevertheless,<ref name="palley742743">

Until after [[World War II]], the landlocked British possession of [[Southern Rhodesia]] was not developed as an indigenous African territory, but rather as a unique state that reflected its [[Multiracialism|multiracial]] character.<ref name="duignan1986">{{citation | last = Duignan | first = Peter | title = Politics and Government in African States 1960–1985 | publisher = Croom Helm Ltd | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-7099-1475-X}}</ref> This situation certainly made it very different from other lands that existed under colonial rule, as many Europeans had arrived to make permanent homes, populating the towns as traders or settling to farm the most productive soils.<ref name="areahandbook">{{citation | last = Nelson | first = Harold | title = Zimbabwe: a country study | publisher = The American University (Washington, D.C.) | year = 1983 | isbn = 0160015987}}</ref><ref name="taylor2006">{{citation | last = Taylor | first = Scott | title = Culture and Customs of Zambia | publisher = Greenwood | year = 2006 | isbn = 0313332460 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00tayl }}</ref> In 1922, faced with the decision to join the [[Union of South Africa]] as a fifth province or accept nearly full internal autonomy, the electorate cast its vote against South African integration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rhodesia.nl/mztosm.html |title=Rhodesia – Mzilikaze to Smith |publisher=Rhodesia.nl |accessdate=9 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826192258/http://www.rhodesia.nl/mztosm.html |archive-date=26 August 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/rhodesia-central-african-federation.htm |title=The Cabinet Papers &#124; Rhodesia and the Central African Federation |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=9 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009031609/https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/rhodesia-central-african-federation.htm |archive-date=9 October 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=ad28 |title=History of Zimbabwe |publisher=Historyworld.net |accessdate=9 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624112253/http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ad28 |archive-date=24 June 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Over the course of the next three decades, Southern Rhodesia experienced a degree of economic expansion and industrialisation almost unrivaled in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name=Barber>{{cite book|last=Barber|first=William|title=The Economy of British Central Africa|date=1961|pages=ix–xi, 18–29, 108|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0812216202}}</ref> Its natural abundance of mineral wealth—including large deposits of chromium and manganese—contributed to the high rate of conventional economic growth.<ref name=Barber/> However, most colonies in Africa, even those rich in natural resources, experienced difficulty in achieving similar rates of development due to a shortage of technical and managerial skills.<ref name=Barber/> Small, rotating cadres of colonial civil servants who possessed little incentive to invest their skills in the local economy were insufficient to compensate for this disadvantage.<ref name=Barber/> Southern Rhodesia had negated the issue by importing a skilled workforce directly from abroad in the form of its disproportionately large European immigrant and expatriate population.<ref name=Barber/> For example, in 1951 over 90% of white Southern Rhodesians were engaged in what the British government classified as "skilled occupations", or professional and technical trades.<ref name=Barber/> This resulted in the establishment of a diversified economy with a strong manufacturing sector and iron and steel industries.<ref name="duignan1986"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countriesquest.com/africa/zimbabwe/history/settler_colony.htm |title=Settler Colony – History – Zimbabwe – Africa |publisher=Countriesquest.com |accessdate=9 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512205433/http://www.countriesquest.com/africa/zimbabwe/history/settler_colony.htm |archive-date=12 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As the white population increased, so too did capital imports, especially in the wake of World War II.<ref name=Barber/> The considerable investment made by European residents in the economy financed the development of Southern Rhodesia's export industries as well as the infrastructure necessary to integrate it further with international markets.<ref name=Barber/>

In 1953, Southern Rhodesia merged with the two other British Central African states to form the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] – a loose association that placed defence and economic direction under a central government but left many domestic affairs under the control of its constituent territories.<ref name="weitzer1990">{{cite book|last=Weitzer|first=Ronald|title=Transforming Settler States: Communal Conflict and Internal Security in Northern Ireland and Zimbabwe|pages=1–206}}</ref> As it began to appear that decolonisation was inevitable and indigenous black populations were pressing heavily for change,<ref name="duignan1986"/> the federation was dissolved in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |author=afrikantraveler |url=http://theafricanfile.com/politicshistory/rhodesia-a-failed-attempt-to-maintain-racism-into-the-21st-century/ |title=Rhodesia: A Failed Attempt to Maintain Racism into the 21st Century |publisher=The African File |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=9 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716010434/http://theafricanfile.com/politicshistory/rhodesia-a-failed-attempt-to-maintain-racism-into-the-21st-century/ |archive-date=16 July 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2838/Banda-Hastings-Kamuzu.html |title=Hastings Kamuzu Banda Biography – Detoured on Road to Become a Doctor, Pursued Degrees with Diligence, Spoke Out Against Racism – JRank Articles |publisher=Biography.jrank.org |accessdate=9 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224194603/http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2838/Banda-Hastings-Kamuzu.html |archive-date=24 December 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Novak |first=Andrew |url=https://independent.academia.edu/AndrewNovak/Papers/1265638/Sport_and_Racial_Discrimination_in_Colonial_Zimbabwe_A_Reanalysis |title=Academia.edu &#124; Sport and Racial Discrimination in Colonial Zimbabwe: A Reanalysis &#124; Andrew Novak |publisher=Independent.academia.edu |accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref>

===Unilateral Declaration of Independence (1965)===<!-- This section is linked from [[Victoria Falls]] -->

Although prepared to grant formal independence to Southern Rhodesia (now Rhodesia), the [[British government]] had adopted a policy of ''[[no independence before majority rule]]'', dictating that colonies with a population of European settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of [[majority rule]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=173&regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa |title=Database – Uppsala Conflict Data Program |publisher=UCDP |accessdate=9 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603091825/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=173&regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa |archive-date=3 June 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rhodesia.nl/tiger.htm |title=On Board the Tiger |publisher=Rhodesia.nl |date=9 October 1968 |accessdate=9 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012003742/http://www.rhodesia.nl/tiger.htm |archive-date=12 October 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psywarrior.com/RhodesiaPSYOP.html |title=RHODESIA PSYOP 1965 |publisher=Psywarrior.com |accessdate=9 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002024639/http://www.psywarrior.com/RhodesiaPSYOP.html |archive-date=2 October 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> White Rhodesians initially balked at the suggestion; some felt they had a right to absolute political control, at least for the time being, despite their relatively small numbers.<ref name="weitzer1990"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zimembassy.se/history.html |title=A brief history of Zimbabwe |publisher=Zimembassy.se |date=18 April 1980 |accessdate=9 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823010147/http://www.zimembassy.se/history.html |archive-date=23 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Rhodesian authorities were also disturbed by the post-independence chaos that was plaguing other African nations at the time.<ref name="SmithGB">{{cite book|author= Smith, Ian|title=The Great Betrayal|pages=74–256|publisher= Blake Publishing Ltd.|location=London|year=1997|isbn= 1-85782-176-9}}</ref> However, once Rhodesia had been introduced as a topic for discussion in international bodies, extension of the status quo became a matter of concern to the world community and a serious embarrassment to the United Kingdom.<ref name="areahandbook"/>

On 12 October 1965, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] had noted the repeated threats of the Rhodesian authorities "to declare unilaterally the independence of Southern Rhodesia, in order to perpetuate minority rule", and called upon Wilson to use all means at his disposal (including military force) to prevent the Rhodesian Front from asserting independence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Question of Southern Rhodesia|url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/2012(XX)|id=A/RES/2012(XX)|date=12 October 1965|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 March 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318090144/http://undocs.org/A/RES/2012(XX)|archive-date=18 March 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> After UDI was proclaimed, UN officials branded Ian Smith's government as an "illegal racist minority regime"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southerntimesafrica.com/news_article.php?id=7348&title=Learning%20From%20Rhodesia&type=83 |title=Southern Times-Learning From Rhodesia |publisher=Southerntimesafrica.com |date=12 November 1965 |accessdate=9 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509030234/http://www.southerntimesafrica.com/news_article.php?id=7348&title=Learning%20From%20Rhodesia&type=83 |archive-date=9 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and called on member states to sever economic ties with Rhodesia, recommending [[International sanctions|sanctions]] on petroleum products and military hardware.<ref name="areahandbook"/> In December 1966, these measures became mandatory,{{Clarify|reason=The UN has dubious and ambiguous authority on the matter.

Initially, the state retained its pledged loyalty to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]], recognising her as Queen of Rhodesia.<ref name="areahandbook"/> When Smith and Deputy Prime Minister [[Clifford Dupont]] called on colonial Governor Sir [[Humphrey Gibbs]] to formally notify him of the UDI, Gibbs condemned the UDI as an act of treason. After Smith formally announced the UDI on the radio, Gibbs used his [[reserve power]] to dismiss Smith and his entire cabinet from office on orders from Whitehall. However, Gibbs was unable to enact any concrete actions to foster a return to legality. Government ministers simply ignored his notices, contending that UDI made his office obsolete. Even so, Gibbs continued to occupy his residence in Salisbury until 1970, when he vacated the premises and left Rhodesia following the declaration of a republic.<ref name="Age">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IhdVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cpMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1090%2C4932581 Queen's man resigns], ''[[The Age]]'', 26 June 1969</ref> He had effectively been superseded before then; the Smith government stated that if the Queen did not appoint a Governor-General, it would name Dupont as "[[Officer Administering the Government]]".<ref name="strips">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vzNIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qgANAAAAIBAJ&pg=782%2C2383897 Ian Smith Strips Gibbs Of All Official Privilege], Associated Press, ''[[The Morning Record]]'', 18 November 1965</ref> Smith had intended to have Dupont named Governor-General, but Queen Elizabeth II would not even consider this advice. With few exceptions, the international community backed Whitehall's assertion that Gibbs was the Queen's only legitimate representative, and hence the only lawful authority in what it still maintained was ''Southern'' Rhodesia.

In September 1968, the [[Appellate court|Appellate Division]] of the High Court of Rhodesia ruled that Ian Smith's administration had become the ''de jure'' government of the country, not merely the ''de facto'' one.<ref name="Beadle">''Rhodesia Herald'', Salisbury, 13 to 20 September 1968</ref> To support his decision, Chief Justice [[Hugh Beadle|Sir Hugh Beadle]] used several statements made by [[Hugo Grotius]], who maintained that there was no way that a nation could rightly claim to be governing a particular territory – if it was waging a war against that territory.

====Impact of UDI====

The years following Rhodesia's UDI saw an unfolding series of economic, military, and political pressures placed on the country that eventually brought about majority rule, a totality of these factors rather than any one the reason for introducing change.<ref name="frontiersmen">{{cite book|last=Clayton|first=Anthony|title=Frontiersmen: Warfare in Africa since 1950|pages=1–260}}</ref> In 2005, a conference at the [[London School of Economics]] that discussed Rhodesia's independence concluded that UDI was sparked by an existing racial conflict complicated by [[Cold War]] intrigues.<ref name="b">{{cite web|author=Dr. Sue Onslow|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CWSC/events/rhodesian_UDI_40_jan_06.htm|title=UDI: 40 Years On|publisher=LSE|accessdate=10 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013165015/http://lse.ac.uk/collections/CWSC/events/rhodesian_UDI_40_jan_06.htm|archive-date=13 October 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Critics of UDI sought to maintain that Ian Smith intended only to safeguard the privileges of an entrenched colonial elite at the expense of the impoverished African community. According to this logic, UDI created a vacuum of oppression that was eventually filled by [[Robert Mugabe]]'s dictatorship.<ref name="c">{{cite web|author=Michael Hartnack|year=2005|url=http://www.theherald.co.za/herald/2005/10/25/cols/hcols.htm|title=40 years in wilderness after UDI declaration|publisher=The Herald|accessdate=10 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320101625/http://www.theherald.co.za/herald/2005/10/25/cols/hcols.htm|archive-date=20 March 2006|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Smith and his supporters continued to defend their actions, however, by claiming that the Rhodesian majority was too inexperienced at the time to manage what was, by contemporary African standards, a reasonably industrialised nation.<ref name="SmithGB"/>

At large, the European population's emerging attitude to UDI was tense. Many white Rhodesians had seen themselves as nothing less than fully fledged members of the British Empire, carrying on the same rugged values and frontier spirit of the early Englishmen who had settled in 1890.<ref name="raft"/> But such confidence was rudely shaken by Whitehall's refusal to grant independence on their terms. After 1965, there were those who continued to claim that they were collectively upholders of principle and defenders of such values against the twin threats of communism, manifested through the militant black nationalists, and the [[decadence]] of Britain herself.<ref name="raft"/> Often repeated appeals to the Christian heritage of their pioneer ancestors in "defending the [[free world]]" reflected these beliefs.<ref name="raft"/>

African parties displayed initial horror at Smith's declaration, with one [[Zimbabwe African National Union|ZANU]] official stating, "...for all those who cherish freedom and a meaningful life, UDI has set a collision course that cannot be altered. 11 November 1965 [has] marked the turning point of the struggle for freedom in that land from a constitutional and political one to primarily a military struggle."<ref name="blackfire"/> It would, however, be several years before even the most radical nationalists chose to develop a coherent strategy revolving around armed resistance, preferring instead to create opportunities for [[Interventionism (politics)|external intervention]].<ref name="blackfire"/>

Because Rhodesian exports were generally competitive and had previously been entitled to preferential treatment on the British market, the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of [[Diversification (marketing strategy)|diversification]] before independence. Following the UDI, however, Rhodesia began to demonstrate that it had the potential to develop a greater degree of economic [[self-sufficiency]].<ref name="SmithGB"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa064.html |title=What's Wrong With Trade Sanctions |publisher=Cato Institute |date=23 December 1985 |accessdate=13 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716043831/http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa064.html |archive-date=16 July 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After the Rhodesian Front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production, industrial output expanded dramatically. A rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in blunting their impact for at least a decade.<ref name="areahandbook"/> Over the next nine years Rhodesian companies, spiting the [[International asset recovery|freezing of their assets and blocking of overseas accounts]], also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries, which operated on a clandestine trade network.<ref name="areahandbook"/>

From 1968 until 1970, there was virtually no further dialogue between Rhodesia and the UK. In a [[Rhodesian constitutional referendum, 1969|referendum]] in 1969, white voters approved a new constitution and the establishment of a republic, thereby severing Rhodesia's last links with the British Crown, duly declared in March 1970. This changed immediately after the election of [[Edward Heath]], who reopened negotiations.<ref name="racewar">{{cite book|last=Brownell|first=Josiah|title=Collapse of Rhodesia: Population Demographics and the Politics of Race|pages=1–255}}</ref> Smith remained optimistic that Heath would do his utmost to remedy Anglo-Rhodesian relations, although disappointed that he continued to adhere publicly to the original "five principles" proposed by Alec Douglas-Home, now [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]]. In November 1971, Douglas-Home renewed contacts with Salisbury and announced a proposed agreement that would be satisfactory to both sides – it recognised Rhodesia's 1969 constitution as the legal frame of government, while agreeing that gradual legislative representation was an acceptable formula for unhindered advance to majority rule.<ref name="areahandbook"/> Nevertheless, the new settlement, if approved, would also implement an immediate improvement in black political status, offer a means to terminate racial discrimination, and provide a solid guarantee against retrogressive constitutional amendments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-BDE-84-al.sff.document.acoa000370.pdf |title=Zimbabwe Rejects Sellout! |publisher=American Committee on Africa |date=1 February 1972 |accessdate=13 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605054701/http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-BDE-84-al.sff.document.acoa000370.pdf |archive-date=5 June 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Implementation of the proposed settlement hinged on popular acceptance, but the Rhodesian government consistently refused to submit it to a universal referendum.<ref name="areahandbook"/> A twenty four-member commission headed by an eminent jurist, [[Edward Pearce, Baron Pearce|Lord Pearce]], was therefore tasked with ascertaining [[public opinion]] on the subject.<ref name="historyps">{{cite book|last=Zvobgo|first=Chengetai|title=A History of Zimbabwe, 1890–2000 and Postscript, Zimbabwe, 2001–2008|pages=1–410}}</ref> In 1972, the commission began interviewing interest groups and sampling opinions – although concern was expressed over the widespread [[Political apathy|apathy]] encountered.<ref name="SmithGB"/> According to the commission, whites were in favour of the settlement, and Rhodesians of [[Coloured]] or Asian ancestry generally pleased, while the black response to the settlement's terms was resoundingly negative.<ref name="racewar"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/18/newsid_2530000/2530291.stm |title=1972: Rhodesia's former leader arrested |publisher=BBC |date=18 January 1972 |accessdate=13 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215143739/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/18/newsid_2530000/2530291.stm |archive-date=15 December 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As many as thirty black Rhodesian chiefs and politicians voiced their opposition, prompting Britain to withdraw from the proposals on the grounds of the commission's report.<ref name="historyps"/>

===The Bush War===

{{main|Rhodesian Bush War}}

As early as 1960, [[minority rule]] in Southern Rhodesia was already being challenged by a rising tide of [[political violence]] led by African nationalists such as [[Joshua Nkomo]] and [[Ndabaningi Sithole]]. After their public campaigns were initially suppressed, many believed that negotiation was completely incapable of meeting their aspirations. Petrol bombings by radicals became increasingly common, with the ''Zimbabwe Review'' observing in 1961, "for the first time home-made petrol bombs were used by freedom fighters in Salisbury against settler establishments."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rhodesia.nl/wilkinson.html |title=Insurgency in Rhodesia, 1957–1973: An Account and Assessment |publisher=International Institute for Strategic Studies |year=1973 |accessdate=13 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525121502/http://www.rhodesia.nl/wilkinson.html |archive-date=25 May 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It was officially noted that between January and September 1962 alone, 33 bombings were carried out, in addition to 27 acts of attempted sabotage on communications. In that same period, nationalists were implicated in arson targeting 18 schools and 10 churches.<ref name="blackfire"/> Nkomo's [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) subsequently disclosed that it had formed a military wing, the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), and 'the decision to start bringing in arms and ammunition and to send young men away for sabotage training' had already been made. The Rhodesian authorities responded by [[Ban (law)|banning]] ZAPU and driving its supporters underground.<ref name="crisis">{{cite book|last=Shamuyarira|first=Nathan|title=Crisis in Rhodesia|pages=202–203}}</ref> Frustrated by their repeated failures, nationalists also conducted a campaign of terror against black Africans, murdering those who had either identified with the colonial administration or had simply failed to demonstrate their allegiance to the cause.<ref name="blackfire"/> To protect civilians, emergency laws were imposed, broadening the legal definition of unlawful gatherings and giving the police greater powers to crack down on agitators or subversives.<ref name="Emergency">''Palm Beach Post'', Miami, 26 March 1959</ref> The [[capital punishment|death sentence]] was also introduced for terrorism involving explosives and arson.<ref name="areahandbook"/>

A crisis of confidence soon resulted across ZAPU, which was already suffering from poor morale, compounded by tribal and ideological factionalism. In 1963, party dissidents rejected Joshua Nkomo's authority and formed their own organisation, the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU) – which worked out its own strategy for impressing international opinion, undermining white assurance, and achieving a complete breakdown of order. By August 1964, ZANU was banned by the Rhodesian government as well, which cited widespread intimidation by that party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rhodesia.nl/wilkinson.html |title=The Rhodesian Agreement: Aspects and Prospects |publisher=South African Institute of International Affairs |year=1978 |accessdate=13 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525121502/http://www.rhodesia.nl/wilkinson.html |archive-date=25 May 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

ZANU's agenda was inward-looking, leftist, and [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africanist]] in nature. Ndabaningi Sithole and avowed Marxist Robert Mugabe, its most prominent leaders, demanded a one-party Zimbabwean state with majority rule and a public monopoly on land.<ref name="areahandbook"/> After being forced from Rhodesia, they continued to operate in exile, creating occupation groups representing urban workers, miners, and peasant farmers. ZANU also attracted professionals, students, and feminists to its ranks. While ZAPU theoretically continued to command the allegiance of most [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] and [[Shona people|Shona]] activists, Sithole and Mugabe drew their support base from the rural peasantry in the [[Mashonaland]] countryside.<ref name="areahandbook"/>

After the UDI, ZANU officials mapped an elaborate plan for the "liberation of Zimbabwe" which called for attacks on white farmers, destruction of cash crops, disrupting electricity in urban areas, and petrol bombings.<ref name="blackfire"/> They also formed an armed wing of their own, the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA).<ref name="frontiersmen"/>

Sithole and Nkomo both insisted on the need for armed struggle, but disagreed on the means to go about it. For example, ZIPRA tended to follow Soviet thinking, placing an emphasis on sophisticated weaponry in the hopes of winning a conventional battle like the [[Viet Minh]] at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bien Phu]]. ZANLA militants preferred to politicise populations in areas which they intended to seize.<ref name="frontiersmen"/> Neither force, however, had acquired basic knowledge of guerrilla warfare. Debate on political theory and insurgent tactics became the obsession of nationalists at this stage.<ref name="blackfire"/>

[[File:Scoutwithgun.jpg|thumb|Rhodesian soldier interrogating villagers in late 1977 at gunpoint. This photograph would become one of the most enduring images of the bush war.]]

In April 1966, two ZANLA units, having received prior training at [[Nanjing]] Military College, crossed into Rhodesia from Zambia. They were armed with [[SKS]] carbines, hand grenades, explosives, and communist pamphlets, having been issued vague instructions to sabotage important installations before killing white persons indiscriminately.<ref name="blackfire"/> At least five guerrillas were simply arrested before getting very far. Another seven hoped to destroy a [[Electricity pylon|pylon]] carrying electricity to [[Chinhoyi|Sinoia]] in the northwest.

The campaign proper is generally considered to have started in 1972 with the [[Attack on Altena Farm]], despite the minor threat already represented by the nationalist movements in the 1960s.

After unsuccessful appeals to Britain and the United States for military assistance, [[Robert Mugabe]], who was based in Mozambique after that country's independence from Portugal in 1975, led ZANU to seek support from the People's Republic of China and countries of the [[Soviet Bloc]]. [[Joshua Nkomo]], based in [[Zambia]] and also supported by the [[Soviet Union]], led ZAPU.<ref name="impression">{{cite web |url=http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF001975/Wright/Wright12/Wright12.html |title=APF newsletter, "Appraisal of Rhodesia in 1975" |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531063909/http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF001975/Wright/Wright12/Wright12.html |archivedate=31 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ZANU and ZAPU together formed 'the Patriotic Front'. Broadly, ZANLA recruited mainly from Mashonaland and Manicaland provinces, whilst the ZIPRA recruited from Mashonaland West, Midlands and Matabeleland provinces of Zimbabwe. As Mugabe had described himself in an interview as a "Marxist-Leninist of Maoist Thought", which enraged the Kremlin, Soviet support went exclusively to ZAPU while China supported ZANU.<ref name="autogenerated465">Andrew, Christopher & Gordievsky, Oleg ''The KGB The Inside Story'', London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1990 page 465.</ref> Soviet arms went to the ZAPU via Zambia and Mozambique, and Nkomo was in regular contact with Vasili Grigoryevich Solodovnikov, the Soviet ambassador to Zambia who was also known to be associated with the KGB.<ref name="autogenerated465"/> Nkomo, who depended heavily on Soviet arms, had what he called an "extensive correspondence" with Yuri Andropov, the KGB chief, while officers from the Cuban DGI provided training for the ZAPU.<ref name="autogenerated465"/>

After the collapse of Portuguese rule in Mozambique in 1974–75, it was no longer viable for the Smith regime to sustain white [[minority rule]] indefinitely. By this time, even South Africa's [[John Vorster|Vorster]] had come to this view. While Vorster was unwilling to make concessions to his own country's blacks, he concluded that white minority rule was not sustainable in a country where blacks outnumbered whites 22:1.<ref name="impression"/> In 1978, there were 270,000 Rhodesians of European descent and more than six million Africans.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

International business groups involved in the country (e.g. [[Lonrho]]) transferred their support from the Rhodesian government to black nationalist parties. Business leaders and politicians feted Nkomo on his visits to Europe. ZANU also attracted business supporters who saw the course that future events were likely to take.<ref>[[The Guardian]], 21 April 2000 [https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,212767,00.html British Multimillionaire bankrolls Mugabe party]</ref> Funding and arms support provided by supporters, particularly from the Soviet Union and its allies in the latter 1970s, allowed both ZIPRA and the ZANLA to acquire more sophisticated weaponry, thereby increasing the military pressure that the guerrillas were able to place on Rhodesia.

Until 1972, containing the guerrillas was little more than a police action.

At this point, ZANU's alliance with [[FRELIMO]] (the Liberation Front of Mozambique) and the porous border between Mozambique and eastern Rhodesia enabled large-scale training and infiltration of ZANU/ZANLA fighters.

The government adopted a [[strategic hamlet]]s policy of the kind used in [[Malayan Emergency#Comparisons with Vietnam|Malaya]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] to restrict the influence of insurgents over the population of rural areas. Local people were forced to relocate to protected villages (PVs) which were strictly controlled and guarded by the government against rebel atrocities. The protected villages were compared by the guerrillas to [[concentration camps]]. Some contemporary accounts claim that this interference in the lives of local residents induced many of them who had previously been neutral to support the guerrillas.<ref>APF Newsletter, 1976 :[http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF001975/Wright/Wright17/Wright17.html Rhodesia's "Protected" Blacks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217225248/http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF001975/Wright/Wright17/Wright17.html|date=17 December 2007}}</ref>

Rhodesia began to lose vital economic and military support from South Africa, which, while sympathetic to the white minority government, never accorded it diplomatic recognition. The South African government placed limits on the fuel and munitions they supplied to the Rhodesian military. They also withdrew the personnel and equipment that they had previously provided to aid the war effort, though covert military support continued.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/24/newsid_2537000/2537969.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 24 &#124; 1976: White rule in Rhodesia to end |work=BBC News |accessdate=9 October 2012 |date=24 September 1976 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023233416/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/24/newsid_2537000/2537969.stm |archive-date=23 October 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 1976, the South African government and [[United States government]]s worked together to place pressure on Smith to agree to a form of majority rule. In response to the initiative of US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], in 1976 Ian Smith accepted the principle of black majority rule within two years.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> The Rhodesians now offered more concessions, but those concessions, focused on reaching an "internal settlement" with moderate black leaders, were insufficient to end the war.

At the time, some Rhodesians said the still embittered history between the British-dominated Rhodesia and the [[Afrikaner]]-dominated South Africa partly led the South African government to withdraw its aid to Rhodesia. Ian Smith said in his memoirs that even though many white South Africans supported Rhodesia, South African Prime Minister [[John Vorster]]'s policy of [[détente]] with the Black African states ended up with Rhodesia being offered as the "sacrificial lamb" to buy more time for South Africa. Other observers perceived South Africa's distancing itself from Rhodesia as being an early move in the process that led to majority rule in South Africa itself.<ref>APF newsletter, 1976: [http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF001975/Wright/Wright19/Wright19.html appraisal of Rhodesia in 1976] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911213214/http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF001975/Wright/Wright19/Wright19.html |date=11 September 2010 }}</ref>

In the latter 1970s, the militants had successfully put the economy of Rhodesia under significant pressure while the numbers of guerrillas in the country were steadily increasing.<ref>Time magazine, 7 August 1978: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948221-1,00.html Rhodesia faces collapse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930090622/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948221-1,00.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref><ref>Time magazine, 1 August 1978: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915164-1,00.html taking the chicken run] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930122153/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915164-1,00.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> The government abandoned its early strategy of trying to defend the borders in favour of trying to defend key economic areas and lines of communication with South Africa, while the rest of the countryside became a patchwork of "[[no-go area]]s".

====Late 1970s====

By the late 1970s, Rhodesia's front-line forces contained about 25,000 regular troops and police – backed up by relatively strong army and police reserves.<ref>{{cite web|author=Major Charles Lohman and Major Robert MacPherson|title="Rhodesia: Tactical Victory, Strategic Defeat" WAR SINCE 1945 SEMINAR AND SYMPOSIUM, US Marine Corps Command and Staff College, June 1983 – See Chapter 3|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/2546386/Rhodesia-Tactical-Victory-Srategic-Defeat|publisher=Scribd.com|accessdate=9 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102105856/http://www.scribd.com/doc/2546386/Rhodesia-Tactical-Victory-Srategic-Defeat|archive-date=2 November 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Its mechanised contingent consisted of light armoured cars and improvised [[MRAP|mine-protected]] armoured personnel carriers, complemented by eight tanks (Polish built [[T-54/T-55 Operators and variants#Poland|T-55LD]] tanks), delivered in the last year of the war. The [[Rhodesian Air Force]] operated an assortment of both [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] light bombers, [[Hawker Hunter]] fighter bombers, older [[de Havilland Vampire]] jets as well as a somewhat antiquated, but still potent, helicopter arm. These forces, including highly trained special operations units, were capable of launching devastating raids on resistance movement camps outside the country, as in [[Operation Dingo]] in 1977 and other similar operations.

Nevertheless, guerrilla pressure inside the country itself was steadily increasing in the latter 1970s. By 1978–79, the war had become a contest between the guerrilla warfare placing ever increasing pressure on the Rhodesian regime and civil population, and the Rhodesian government's strategy of trying to hold off the militants until external recognition for a compromise political settlement with moderate black leaders could be secured.

By this time, the need to cut a deal was apparent to most Rhodesians, but not to all. Ian Smith had dismissed his intransigent Defence Minister, [[P. K. van der Byl]], as early as 1976.<ref>Rhodesia Worldwide:[http://www.rhodesiana.com/rsr/rsr3-004.html "PK"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313201045/http://www.rhodesiana.com/rsr/rsr3-004.html |date=13 March 2006 }}</ref> Van der Byl was a hard-line opponent of any form of compromise with domestic opposition or the international community since before UDI.

Van der Byl eventually retired to his country estate outside [[Cape Town]], but there were elements in Rhodesia, mainly embittered former security force personnel, who forcibly opposed majority rule up to and well beyond the establishment of majority rule.<ref>Newsnet report : [http://www.newsnet.co.zw/index.php?nID=6941 saboteurs hit Zimbabwean military, partisan comment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418031150/http://www.newsnet.co.zw/index.php?nID=6941|date=18 April 2007}}</ref> New white immigrants continued to arrive in Rhodesia right up to the eve of majority rule.<ref>''Time'' magazine, October 1977 : [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915681,00.html The Land of Opportunity]</ref>

====Intensification of the Bush War====

The work of journalists such as [[Lord Richard Cecil]], son of the [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 6th Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]], stiffened the morale of Rhodesians and their overseas supporters.<ref>''The Guardian'', 15 July 2003: [https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,998195,00.html obituary of sixth Marquess of Salisbury]</ref> Lord Richard produced news reports for ITN which typically contrasted the incompetent insurgents with the "superbly professional" government troops.<ref>Nick Downie report: [http://www.rhodesianforces.org/Pages/Army/Rhodesia%20-%20a%20study%20in%20military%20incompetence.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510234222/http://www.rhodesianforces.org/Pages/Army/Rhodesia%20-%20a%20study%20in%20military%20incompetence.htm |date=10 May 2006 }}</ref> A group of ZANLA fighters killed Lord Richard on 20 April 1978 when he was accompanying a Rhodesian airborne unit employed in Fire Force Operations.<ref>2nd Lt CJE Vincent BCR who was present when Lord Cecil was killed</ref>

The shooting down on 3 September 1978 of the civilian [[Air Rhodesia]] airliner, a [[Vickers Viscount]] named the ''[[Air Rhodesia Flight 825|Hunyani]]'', in the [[Kariba, Zimbabwe|Kariba]] area by ZIPRA fighters using a [[surface-to-air missile]], with the subsequent massacre of its survivors, is widely considered to be the event that finally destroyed the Rhodesians' will to continue the war. Although militarily insignificant, the loss of this aircraft (and a second Viscount, named the ''[[Air Rhodesia Flight 827|Umniati]]'', in 1979) demonstrated the reach of resistance movements extended to Rhodesian civil society.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://home.iprimus.com.au/rob_rickards/viscounts/hunyani.htm |title=The Viscount Disasters – The Story |access-date=13 January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304002303/http://home.iprimus.com.au/rob_rickards/viscounts/hunyani.htm |archive-date=4 March 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The Rhodesians' means to continue the war were also eroding fast. In December 1978, a ZANLA unit penetrated the outskirts of Salisbury and fired a volley of rockets and [[incendiary device]] rounds into the main oil storage depot – the most heavily defended economic asset in the country. The storage tanks burned for five days, giving off a column of smoke that could be seen {{convert|80|mi|km|order=flip}} away. {{convert|0.5e6|oilbbl|m3|spell=In}} of petroleum product (comprising Rhodesia's strategic oil reserve) were lost.<ref>The Atlantic Monthly : [http://www.rmi.org/cms/Download.aspx?id=1296&file=S83-08_FragileDomEnergy.pdf&title=The+Fragility+of+Domestic+Energy The Fragility of Domestic Energy, see page 5]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

The government's defence spending increased from R$30 million, 8.5% of the national budget in 1971 to 1972, to R$400 m in 1978 to 1979, 47% of the national budget. In 1980, the post-independence government of Zimbabwe inherited a US$500 million national debt.<ref>Selby thesis: [http://www.zwnews.com/3-Main%20Body.pdf ZWNEWS.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813050154/http://www.zwnews.com/3-Main%20Body.pdf |date=13 August 2012 }}, p 88</ref>

===End of UDI (1979)===

[[File:Internal Settlement.jpg|thumb|Signing of the Rhodesian Internal Settlement (from left: Bishop Abel Muzorewa, [[Ian Smith]], [[Jeremiah Chirau]] and [[Ndabaningi Sithole]])]]

The Rhodesian army continued its "mobile counter-offensive" strategy of holding key positions ("vital asset ground") while carrying out raids into the no-go areas and into neighbouring countries. While often extraordinarily successful in inflicting heavy guerrilla casualties, such raids also on occasion failed to achieve their objectives. In April 1979 special forces carried out a raid on [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s residence in [[Lusaka]] ([[Zambia]]) with the stated intention of assassinating him.{{cn|date=August 2020}} Nkomo and his family left hastily a few hours before the raid – having clearly been warned that the raid was coming.

In 1979, some special forces units were accused of using counterinsurgent operations as cover for ivory poaching and smuggling. Colonel [[Reid-Daly]] (commander of the [[Selous Scouts]]) discovered that his phone was bugged and after challenging a superior officer on this issue was court martialled for insubordination. He received the lightest sentence possible, a caution, but he continued to fight his conviction and eventually resigned his commission and left the Army.

By 1978–79, up to 70% of the regular army was composed of black soldiers (though both the army and police reserves remained overwhelmingly white). By 1979 there were also 30 black commissioned officers in the regular army. While there was never any suggestion of disloyalty among the soldiers from predominantly black units (in particular within the Selous Scouts or the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]] – RAR), some argue that, by the time of the 1980 election, many of the RAR soldiers voted for Robert Mugabe.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

As the result of an [[Internal Settlement]] signed on 3 March 1978 between the Rhodesian government and the moderate African nationalist parties, which were not in exile and not involved in the war, elections were held in April 1979. The [[United African National Council]] (UANC) party won a majority in this election, and its leader, [[Abel Muzorewa]] (a [[United Methodist Church]] bishop), became the country's first black prime minister on 1 June 1979. The country's name was changed to [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]]. The internal settlement left control of the country's police, security forces, civil service and judiciary in white hands, for the moment. It assured whites of about one-third of the seats in parliament. It was essentially a power-sharing arrangement between whites and blacks which, in the eyes of many, particularly the insurgents, did not amount to majority rule.<ref>BBC "On this day" report :[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/1/newsid_2492000/2492915.stm 1 June 1979] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115003348/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/1/newsid_2492000/2492915.stm|date=15 November 2006}}.</ref> However, the [[United States Senate]] voted to end economic sanctions against Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 12 June.<ref name="endsanctions">[https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/13/archives/senate-votes-down-a-move-to-preserve-rhodesia-sanctions-armsbill.html Senate Votes Down A Move To Preserve Rhodesia Sanctions; Arms-Bill Veto Threatened White House Says 52-to-41 Margin Shows President Has Support to Prevent an Override] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722214110/https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/13/archives/senate-votes-down-a-move-to-preserve-rhodesia-sanctions-armsbill.html |date=22 July 2018 }}, 13 June 1979. The New York Times.</ref>

While the 1979 election was described by the Rhodesian government as non-racial and democratic, it did not include the main nationalist parties ZANU and ZAPU. In spite of offers from Ian Smith, the latter parties declined to participate in an election in which their political position would be insecure and under a proposed constitution which they had played no part in drafting and which was perceived as retaining strong white minority privilege.

Bishop Muzorewa's government did not receive international recognition. The Bush War continued unabated and sanctions were not lifted. The international community refused to accept the validity of any agreement which did not incorporate the main nationalist parties. The British Government (then led by the recently elected [[Margaret Thatcher]]) issued invitations to all parties to attend a peace conference at [[Lancaster House]]. These negotiations took place in London in late 1979. The three-month-long conference almost failed to reach conclusion, due to disagreements on [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform]], but resulted in the [[Lancaster House Agreement]]. UDI ended, and Rhodesia temporarily reverted to the status of a British colony (the 'Colony of Southern Rhodesia').<ref>Southern Rhodesia (Annexation) Order in Council, 30 July 1923 which provided by section 3 thereof: "From and after the coming into operation of this Order the said territories shall be annexed to and form part of His Majesty's Dominions, and shall be known as the ''Colony of Southern Rhodesia''."</ref> As per the agreement, [[Lord Soames]] became Governor with full legislative and executive powers.

The Lancaster House Agreement further provided for a ceasefire which was followed by an internationally supervised general election, held on [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|February 1980]]. ZANU led by [[Robert Mugabe]] won this election, some alleged,{{who|date=March 2017}} by terrorising its political opposition, including supporters of ZAPU, through former insurgents that had not confined themselves to the designated guerrilla assembly points, as stipulated by the Lancaster House Agreement. The observers and Soames were accused of looking the other way, and Mugabe's victory was certified. Nevertheless, few could doubt that Mugabe's support within his majority Shona tribal group was extremely strong. The Rhodesian military seriously considered mounting a coup against a perceived stolen election ("Operation Quartz") to prevent ZANU from taking over the country.<ref>{{cite web|first=R.|last=Allport|title=Operation Quartz – Rhodesia 1980|url=http://www.memoriesofrhodesia.com/media/documents/Op-Quartz.pdf|website=memoriesofrhodesia.com|access-date=5 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101171326/http://www.memoriesofrhodesia.com/media/documents/Op-Quartz.pdf|archive-date=1 January 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The alleged coup was to include the assassination of Mugabe and coordinated assaults on guerrilla assembly points throughout the country. The plan was eventually scuttled, as it was obvious that Mugabe enjoyed widespread support from the black majority despite voter intimidation, as well as the fact that the coup would gain no external support, and a conflagration which would engulf the country was seen as inevitable.

===Republic of Zimbabwe (1980)===

Mugabe (and nationalists who supported his rule) were rather less concerned by Operation Quartz than by the possibility that there might be a mass exodus of the white community of the kind that had caused chaos in Mozambique five years earlier. Such an exodus had been prepared for by the South African government. With the agreement of the British Governor of Rhodesia, South African troops had entered the country to secure the road approaches to the [[Beit Bridge]] border crossing point. Refugee camps had been prepared in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]. On the day the election results became known, most white families had prepared contingency plans for flight, including the packing of cars and suitcases.

However, after a meeting with Robert Mugabe and the central committee of ZANU (PF), Ian Smith was reassured that whites could and should stay in the new Zimbabwe. Mugabe promised that he would abide strictly by the terms of the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] and that changes in Zimbabwe would be made gradually and by a proper legal process. In a CBS news interview, Mugabe claimed that Rhodesian whites "...are still in control of the economy, the majority being commercial farmers."<ref>{{YouTube|-5XkF9M22sw}}</ref> Mugabe, however, would reverse his commitment to these agreements some years later; the regime began confiscating white-owned farmlands. This is widely blamed for leading to the deterioration of the Zimbabwean economy, which plagues the country today.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20645271 | work=BBC News | title=Ian Smith's farm seized in Zimbabwe as Robert Mugabe eyes election | date=7 December 2012 | access-date=20 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123003326/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20645271 | archive-date=23 November 2018 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 18 April 1980 the country became independent within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] as the Republic of Zimbabwe, and its capital, Salisbury, was renamed [[Harare]] two years later.

== Geography ==

Rhodesia is equivalent in territory to modern [[Zimbabwe]]. It was a [[landlocked country]] in [[southern Africa]], lying between latitudes [[15th parallel south|15°]] and [[23rd parallel south|23°S]], and longitudes [[25th meridian east|25°]] and [[34th meridian east|34°E]]. It was bordered by [[South Africa]] to the south, the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] (later [[Botswana]]) to the west and southwest, [[Zambia]] to the northwest, and [[Mozambique]] to the east and northeast. Its northwest corner was roughly {{convert|0.15|km|m cm mi ft yd in|abbr=off}} from [[South West Africa]] (present-day [[Namibia]]), South Africa, nearly forming a four-nation [[quadripoint]]. Most of the country was elevated, consisting of a central plateau (high veld) stretching from the southwest northwards with altitudes between {{convert|1,000 and 1,600|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The country's extreme east was mountainous, this area being known as the [[Eastern Highlands]], with [[Mount Nyangani|Mount Inyangani]] as the highest point at {{convert|2,592|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

=== Climate ===

{{Main|Climate of Zimbabwe}}

Rhodesia had a [[tropical climate]] with many local variations. The southern areas were known for their heat and aridity, parts of the central plateau received frost in winter, the [[Zambezi]] valley was also known for its extreme heat and the Eastern Highlands usually experienced cool temperatures and the highest rainfall in the country. The country's rainy season was from late October to March and the hot climate was moderated by increasing altitude. The country was faced with recurring droughts, and severe storms were rare.<ref name="Baughan, M. 2005">Baughan, M. (2005). ''Continent in the Balance: Zimbabwe-Juvenile literature''. Philadelphia, PA: Mason Crest Publishers; {{ISBN|1590848101}}.</ref>

=== Biodiversity ===

{{Main|Wildlife of Zimbabwe}}

The country was mostly savannah, although the moist and mountainous eastern highlands supported areas of tropical evergreen and hardwood forests. Trees found in these Eastern Highlands included [[teak]], [[mahogany]], enormous specimens of [[Strangler fig|strangling fig]], [[Newtonia buchananii|forest newtonia]], big leaf, [[Celtis africana|white stinkwood]], [[Celtis mildbraedii|chirinda stinkwood]], [[Senegalia nigrescens|knobthorn]] and many others.

In the low-lying parts of the country [[Vachellia xanthophloea|fever trees]], [[mopane]], [[combretum]] and [[Adansonia|baobabs]] abound. Much of the country was covered by [[miombo]] woodland, dominated by [[brachystegia]] species and others. Among the numerous flowers and shrubs were [[hibiscus]], [[flame lily]], [[Scadoxus puniceus|snake lily]], [[spider lily]], [[Leonotis|leonotus]], [[Cassia (genus)|cassia]], [[Wisteria|tree wisteria]] and [[dombeya]]. There were around 350 species of mammals that can be found in Rhodesia. There were also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species.

==Government and politics==

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2020}}

{{Politics of Rhodesia}}
{{Main|Politics of Rhodesia}}
[[File:Flag of the President of Rhodesia (1970–1979).svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The presidential flag of Rhodesia]]

Although Southern Rhodesia never gained full [[Dominion]] status within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], Southern Rhodesians ruled themselves from the attainment of '[[responsible government|Responsible Government]]' in 1923. Its electoral register had property and education qualifications. Over the years various electoral arrangements made at a national and municipal level upheld these standards. For example, the franchise for the first [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council]] election in 1899 contained the following requirement:

<blockquote>voters to be British subjects, male, 21 years of age and older, able to write their address and occupation, and then to fulfil the following financial requirements: (a) ownership of a registered mining claim in Southern Rhodesia, or (b) occupying immovable property worth £75, or (c) receiving wages or salary of £50 per annum in Southern Rhodesia. Six months' continuous residence was also required for qualifications (b) and (c).</blockquote>

Following [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s dictum of "equal rights for all civilised men", there was no overt racial component to the franchise. However, the requirement excluded a majority of native blacks from the electorate.

Up until the 1950s, Southern Rhodesia had a vibrant political life with right and left wing parties competing for power. The [[Rhodesian Labour Party]] held seats in the Assembly and in municipal councils throughout the 1920s and 1930s. From 1953 to 1958, the prime minister was [[Garfield Todd]], a liberal who did much to promote the development of the Black community through investment in education, housing and healthcare. However, the government forced Todd from office because his proposed reforms were seen by many whites as too radical.

From 1958 onwards, white settler politics consolidated and ossified around resistance to majority rule, setting the stage for UDI. The 1961 Constitution governed Southern Rhodesia and independent Rhodesia up until 1969, using the Westminster Parliamentary System modified by a system of separate voter rolls with differing property and education qualifications, without regard to race. Whites ended up with the majority of Assembly seats.

The 1969 republican constitution established a [[bicameral]] Parliament consisting of an indirectly elected [[Senate of Rhodesia|Senate]] and a directly elected [[House of Assembly of Rhodesia|House of Assembly]], effectively reserving the majority of seats for whites. The office of [[President of Rhodesia|President]] had only ceremonial significance with the Prime Minister holding executive power.

The Constitution of the short-lived [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]], which saw a black-led government elected for the first time, reserved 28 of the 100 parliamentary seats for whites. The independence constitution agreed at [[Lancaster House Agreement|Lancaster House]] watered those provisions down and reserved 20 out of 100 seats for whites in the House of Assembly and 8 out of 40 seats in the Senate. The constitution prohibited Zimbabwe authorities from altering the Constitution for seven years without unanimous consent and required a three-quarters vote in Parliament for a further three years. The government amended the Constitution in 1987 to abolish the seats reserved for whites, and replace the office of Prime Minister with an executive President. In 1990, the government abolished the Senate.

===Administrative divisions===
[[File:Rhodesia adm location map with names.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|[[Provinces of Rhodesia|Administrative divisions of Rhodesia]]]]
Rhodesia had a [[centralised government]] and is divided into seven provinces and two cities with provincial status, for administrative purposes. Each province had a provincial capital from where government administration is usually carried out.

Southern Rhodesia had long been distinctive among British dependencies in that it had financed and developed its own security forces and command structure.<ref name="Good">{{cite book|title=U.D.I: The International Politics of the Rhodesian Rebellion|last=Good|first=Robert|date=1973|publisher=Faber & Faber Press|isbn=978-1400869176|location=London|pages=55–59}}</ref> After UDI, this posed a particular dilemma for the British government, which considered and rejected various proposals aimed at ending Rhodesia's state of rebellion by force.<ref name="Good" /> Harold Wilson once remarked that bringing an end to Rhodesian independence "would not be a case of arresting a subversive individual. It would mean a bloody war, and probably a bloody war turning into a bloody civil war."<ref name="Good" /> The formidable nature of the Rhodesian security forces, as well as British fears of a direct South African intervention on behalf of the rogue colony, preempted the further consideration of military options.<ref name="Good" />

For much of its history Rhodesia had a small professional standing army of 3,400 troops, about a third of whom were black volunteers.<ref name="Good" /> The troops were organised into light infantry battalions optimised for counter-insurgency and unconventional warfare,<ref name="Arnold">{{cite book|title=Wars in the Third World Since 1945|last=Arnold|first=Guy|date=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|isbn=978-14742-9102-6|location=Philadelphia|page=67}}</ref> and they possessed little artillery or armour.<ref name="Good" /> The [[Royal Rhodesian Air Force]] had 1,000 personnel and six squadrons of aircraft, including forty to fifty [[Hawker Hunter]] and [[de Havilland Vampire]] strike aircraft and [[English Electric Canberra]] light bombers.<ref name="Good" /> It also possessed a helicopter squadron, a transport squadron, and a light reconnaissance squadron.<ref name="Good" /> The Rhodesian military was backed by the [[British South Africa Police]] (BSAP), a well-equipped police force whose title was derived from the law enforcement division of the British South Africa Company.<ref name="Good" /> The BSAP had armoured vehicles of its own and a potent paramilitary capability.<ref name="Good" /> Domestic and external intelligence gathering were vested in the [[Central Intelligence Organisation]].<ref name="COIN">{{cite book|title=Counterinsurgency in Modern Warfare|last=Wood|first=JRT|date=2008|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1846032813|editor1-last=Malkasian|editor1-first=Carter|location=Oxford|pages=[https://archive.org/details/counterinsurgenc00dani/page/189 189–342]|editor2-last=Marston|editor2-first=Daniel|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/counterinsurgenc00dani/page/189}}</ref>

As a result of the escalating rural insurgency, the Rhodesian Security Forces began to depend more heavily on white conscripts and reservists of the Territorial Force and Territorial reserves.<ref name="Arnold" /> Regular units remained small throughout the Rhodesian Bush War but became increasingly specialised and were often able to have an effect utterly disproportionate to their size.<ref name="mcnab2002">{{cite book|title=20th Century Military Uniforms|last=McNab|first=Chris|date=2002|publisher=Grange Books|isbn=1-84013-476-3|edition=2nd|location=Kent|page=196}}</ref> The security forces included a disproportionate number of personnel who had seen action during the [[First Malayan Emergency]] as well as the [[Aden Emergency]], and their experience gave Rhodesia's defence establishment a solid grounding in [[counter-insurgency]] warfare and small unit tactics in particular.<ref name="COIN" /> Nevertheless, the vastness of the operational area and Rhodesia's limited manpower pool left the army, air force, and BSAP constantly overstretched.<ref name="COIN" /> Budgetary and resource restraints, coupled with manpower shortages, meant the security forces could not expand quickly enough to match the guerrilla movements, and were almost always outnumbered.<ref name="COIN" /> Rhodesian units compensated for their disadvantage in this regard by pursuing an aggressive preemptive and counterstrike strategy, raiding neighbouring states to destroy guerrilla forces in their external sanctuaries.<ref name="COIN" />

All male Rhodesian citizens aged eighteen to twenty-three, except blacks, were obligated to fulfill four and a half months (later extended to nine months) of full-time [[national service]].<ref name="Good" /> This was followed by a three-year reservist obligation.<ref name="Good" /> By 1974 the national service intakes had been doubled, and whites over twenty-three were also conscripted.<ref name="Arnold" /> In 1978 the Rhodesian Army had about 14,000 white national servicemen, but continued manpower shortages forced it to recruit black volunteers in larger numbers and extend compulsory military service to all white males up to sixty years of age.<ref name="Arnold" /> By the end of the Rhodesian Bush War virtually all male white Rhodesians were either serving in the military or police in a full-time or part-time capacity.<ref name="Arnold" /> The size of the Rhodesian Army had swelled to about 20,000 personnel, and the BSAP to over 40,000, including reservists.<ref name="Arnold" />

===Biological and chemical warfare===

{{main|Rhodesia and weapons of mass destruction}}

From 1975 to 1980 the Rhodesian government made several attempts to weaponise chemical and biological agents.<ref name="Glenn Cross 1980">Glenn Cross, "Dirty War: Rhodesia and Chemical Biological Warfare, 1975–1980," Solihull, UK: Helion & Company, 2017</ref> Members of the security forces contaminated supplies before replacing them in guerrilla caches or planted them in rural stores to be stolen by the guerrillas during raids.<ref>Ed Bird.

Johannesburg, South Africa: Galago Press, 2006</ref>

The chemical agents most used in the Rhodesian chemical and biological warfare (CBW) programme were [[parathion]] (an organophosphate insecticide) and [[thallium]] (a heavy metal commonly found in rodenticide).<ref>Chandré Gould and Peter Folb. "Project Coast: Apartheid's Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme". Geneva: United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, 2002.</ref> The weapons the Rhodesians selected for use also included ''Vibrio cholerae'' (causative agent of [[cholera]]) and possibly ''Bacillus anthracis'' (causative agent of [[anthrax]]). They also looked at using ''Rickettsia prowazekii'' (causative agent of epidemic [[typhus]]), and ''Salmonella typhi'' (causative agent of [[typhoid fever]]), and toxins such as [[ricin]] and [[botulinum]] toxin.<ref name="Glenn Cross 1980" />

Biological agents, namely ''Vibrio cholerae'' (causative agent of [[cholera]]), had some impact on the fighting capability of ZANLA.<ref name="the plague wars">Southern African News Feature: [https://web.archive.org/web/20131203093323/http://www.sardc.net/editorial/sanf/2001/iss21/specialreport.html the plague wars]</ref> Some former officers of the Rhodesian Security Forces alleged that anthrax was used covertly during the late 1970s, but this has been disputed.<ref name="Glenn Cross 1980" /> Use of ''anthracis'', ricin, or botulinum toxin was favoured during assassination attempts of prominent guerrilla commanders.<ref name="Glenn Cross 1980" />

== Economy ==

{{Main|Economic history of Zimbabwe}}

Economically, [[Southern Rhodesia]] developed an economy that was narrowly based on the production of a few primary products, notably, chromium and tobacco. It was therefore vulnerable to the economic cycle. The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom. This boom prompted the immigration of about 200,000 whites between 1945 and 1970, taking the white population up to 307,000. A large number of these immigrants were of British working-class origin, with others coming from the Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, and later Angola and Mozambique. They established a relatively balanced economy, transforming what was once a primary producer dependent on backwoods farming into an industrial giant which spawned a strong manufacturing sector, iron and steel industries, and modern mining ventures. These economic successes owed little to foreign aid apart from the immigration of skilled labour.

The economy of the state of Rhodesia sustained international sanctions for a decade following the declaration of its independence, a resistance which waned as more southern African states declared independence and majority rule as well as the destruction of the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].

==Demographics==

=== Population ===

A central feature of the white community in Rhodesia was its transience, as white settlers were just as likely to leave Rhodesia after a few years as permanently settle; for example, of the 700 British settlers who were the first white settlers, arriving in 1890, only 15 were still living in Rhodesia in 1924.<ref>Brownell, Josiah "The Hole in Rhodesia's Bucket: White Emigration and the End of Settler Rule" pages 591–610 from ''The Journal of Southern African Studies'', Volume 34, No. 3, September 2008 page 593.</ref> As the white population of Rhodesia had a low birth rate (18 per 1,000 compared to the African rate of 48 per 1,000<ref name="Paxton">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0zODQAAQBAJ|title=The Statesman's Year-Book 1971–72: The Businessman's Encyclopaedia of all nations|last=Paxton|first=John|publisher=[[Springer Nature]]|year=1971|isbn=978-0-230-27100-5|edition=108th|location=London|page=522}}</ref>), to maintain white population growth was largely dependent upon taking in new white immigrants with immigration accounting for 60% of the growth of the white Rhodesian population between 1955–72.<ref name="Brownell">Brownell, Josiah "The Hole in Rhodesia's Bucket: White Emigration and the End of Settler Rule" pages 591–610 from ''The Journal of Southern African Studies'', Volume 34, No. 3, September 2008 page 594-610.</ref> However, the American historian Josiah Brownell noted that the turnover rate for white residents in Rhodesia was very high, as Rhodesia took in a total of 255,692 white immigrants between 1955–79 while the same period a total of 246,583 whites emigrated.<ref name="Brownell"/> Even during the boom years of the late 1950s, when Rhodesia took in an average of 13,666 white immigrants per year, mostly from the United Kingdom and South Africa, an average of about 7,666 whites emigrated annually.<ref name="Brownell"/> Between 1961–65, Rhodesia took in an average of 8,225 white immigrants per year while also having an average white emigration of 12,912 per year.<ref name="Brownell"/> Many prospective white immigrants in Rhodesia arrived seeking economic opportunities and departed with fluctuations in the security situation as the Bush War intensified.<ref name="Brownell"/> A substantial number were uninterested in settling there permanently and did not apply for Rhodesian citizenship, despite a much-publicised 1967 campaign urging them to do so.<ref name="Brownell"/> Brownell asserted that patriotism in the white community was "shallow" due to its essentially expatriate character.<ref name="Brownell"/> Brownell also claimed that the majority of white immigrants in the late 1960s and early 1970s were unskilled laborers who competed with the country's black African workforce and did not contribute badly needed technical or professional skills to the country.<ref name="Brownell"/> He argued that this was due to a government policy aimed at making white immigration as "unselective as possible" and guaranteeing every white immigrant a job.<ref name="Brownell"/>

The population of Rhodesia boomed during the late 1960s due to immigration and an exceptional rate of natural increase among its black citizens, the highest in sub-Saharan Africa at the time.<ref name="Brownell"/>

==Foreign relations==

{{more citations needed section|date=February 2011}}

Throughout the period of its [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] (1965 to 1979), Rhodesia pursued a foreign policy of attempting to secure recognition as an independent country, and insisting that its political system would include 'gradual steps to majority rule.' Ardently anti-communist, Rhodesia tried to present itself to the West as a front-line state against communist expansion in Africa, to little avail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/06/the_rhodesia_syndrome.html|title=The Rhodesia Syndrome|access-date=2018-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527023932/https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/06/the_rhodesia_syndrome.html|archive-date=27 May 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Rhodesia received little international recognition during its existence; recognition only occurred after elections in 1980 and a transition to majority rule.

Rhodesia wished to retain its economic prosperity and also feared communist elements in the rebel forces, and thus felt their policy of a gradual progression to black majority rule was justified. However, the international community refused to accept this rationale, believing that their policies were perpetuating racism. This attitude was part of the larger [[decolonisation]] context, during which Western powers such as the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium hastened to grant independence to their colonies in Africa.

===The UK and the UDI===

Rhodesia was originally a [[British colony]]. Although [[decolonisation]] in Africa had begun after World War II, it began accelerating in the early 1960s, causing Britain to negotiate independence rapidly with several of its colonies. During this period, it adopted a foreign policy called [[NIBMAR]], or No Independence Before Majority African Rule, mandating democratic reforms that placed governance in the hands of the majority black Africans. The governing white minority of Rhodesia, led by Ian Smith, opposed the policy and its implications. On 11 November 1965, Rhodesia's minority white government made a [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] (UDI) from the United Kingdom, as it became apparent that negotiations would not lead to independence under the white regime.

The United Kingdom government immediately brought in legislation ([[Southern Rhodesia Act 1965]]) which formally abolished all Rhodesian government institutions. This move made life difficult for Rhodesian citizens who wished to travel internationally as passports issued by Rhodesia's UDI administration were not recognised as valid;<ref name="Passports invalidated">The Southern Rhodesia (Property in Passports) Order 1965 provided that they were the property of the British government, allowing them to be impounded if presented by anyone arriving at a port of entry. See [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1965/nov/24/passports-british-nationality#S5CV0721P0_19651124_HOC_545 Hansard] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713163414/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1965/nov/24/passports-british-nationality#S5CV0721P0_19651124_HOC_545 |date=13 July 2009 }}, HC 5ser vol 721 col 696.</ref> in January 1966, the British issued a statement accepting as valid any passport issued before the declaration of independence and allowing six-month United Kingdom passports to be granted when they expired – provided that the bearer declared they did not intend to aid the UDI Rhodesian government.

Until late 1969, Rhodesia still recognised [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as head of state, even though it opposed the British government itself for hindering its goals of independence. The Queen, however, refused to accept the title ''Queen of Rhodesia.'' Eventually, the Smith government abandoned attempts to remain loyal to the British Crown, and in 1969, a majority of the electorate voted in a 1969 referendum to declare Rhodesia a republic. They hoped that this move would facilitate recognition as an independent state by the international community, but the issues of white minority control remained and hindered this effort, and like the UDI before it, the proclamation of a republic lacked international recognition.

===Sanctions===

After the declaration of independence, and indeed for the entire duration of its existence, Rhodesia did not receive official recognition from any state, although it did maintain diplomatic relations with South Africa, which was then under [[apartheid]]. South Africa did not recognise Rhodesia to preserve its fragile positions with other nations, but frequently assisted the Rhodesian state. Portugal maintained informal relations until the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974. The day following the declaration of independence, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed a resolution ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 216|S/RES/216]]) calling upon all states not to accord Rhodesia recognition, and to refrain from any assistance. The Security Council also imposed selective mandatory economic sanctions, which were later made comprehensive.

===International perspective===

Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965 was promptly condemned by the international community. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 216 of 12 November 1965 called "upon all States not to recognise this illegal racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia."<ref>[[Wikisource:United Nations Security Council Resolution 216]]</ref>

Rhodesia campaigned for international acceptance and invoked the doctrine of [[non-intervention]] in internal affairs as justification for rebuking external criticism of its internal policies. However, the emerging doctrine of [[self-determination]] in colonial situations meant that most nations regarded Rhodesia's self-declared independence as illegitimate.

[[Zambia]], formerly [[Northern Rhodesia]], took a pragmatic approach towards Rhodesia. [[Kenneth Kaunda]], heavily dependent on access through Rhodesia for his nation's copper ore exports, fuel, and power imports unofficially worked with the Rhodesian government. Rhodesia still allowed Zambia to export and import its goods through its territory to Mozambique ports, despite the Zambian government's official policy of hostility and non-recognition of the post-UDI Smith Administration.

The United States, like all other Western nations, refused to recognise Rhodesia, but unlike others allowed its [[Consulate-General]] to function as a communications conduit between the US government in Washington, DC and the Rhodesian government in Salisbury. When Rhodesia set up an information office in Washington, DC, [[Organization of American States|OAS]] nations loudly protested. The US government responded by saying the Rhodesian mission and its staff had no official diplomatic status and violated no US laws.

Portugal pursued a middle path with Rhodesia. While not officially recognising Rhodesia under Ian Smith, the government of [[António Salazar]] did permit Rhodesia to establish a [[Rhodesian mission in Lisbon|representative mission]] in Lisbon, and permitted Rhodesian exports and imports through their colony of Mozambique. The Portuguese government in power at that time, authoritarian and ardently anti-communist, gave active behind-the-scenes support in Rhodesia's fight against the guerrilla groups.

South Africa, itself under international pressure as a white minority government, pursued a policy of [[détente]] with the black African states at the time. These states wanted South Africa to pressure Ian Smith to accept a faster transition to majority rule in Rhodesia, in return for pledges of non-interference in South Africa's internal affairs. Prime Minister [[John Vorster]], believing majority rule in Rhodesia would lead to international acceptance for South Africa, used a number of tactics to pressure Smith. The South African government held up shipments of fuel and ammunition and pulled out friendly South African forces from Rhodesia. The combined loss of Mozambique and the loss of support from South Africa dealt critical blows to the Rhodesian government.

===Diplomatic relations===

After the UDI, Rhodesia maintained several overseas missions, including [[Pretoria]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Harry R.

Since 1961, Rhodesia had an "Accredited Diplomatic Representative" with [[South Africa]], heading a "Rhodesian Diplomatic Mission" or [[de facto embassy|''de facto'' embassy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Southern Rhodesia.

===Results===

Continuing civil war and a lack of international support eventually led the Rhodesian government to submit to an agreement with the UK in 1979. This led to internationally supervised elections, won by [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front]] and Robert Mugabe, establishing the internationally recognised [[Zimbabwe]].

==Legacy==

In the ten years after independence, around 60% of the white population of [[Zimbabwe]] emigrated, most to [[South Africa]] and to other mainly white, English speaking countries where they formed expatriate communities. Politically within Zimbabwe, the consolidation of power by Robert Mugabe continued through the 1980s. Following amendments to the country's constitution in 1987, parliamentary seats reserved for whites were abolished, and an executive presidency was created, held by [[Mugabe]]. Many expatriates and some of the whites who stayed in Zimbabwe became deeply nostalgic for Rhodesia. These individuals are known as "[[Rhodie]]s." Native whites who are more accepting of the new order are known as "Zimbos."

The nation has suffered profound economic and social decline in the past twenty years. Recently, the agriculture sector has started to do well since the availability of expertise and machines has improved, supported mainly by [[China]].<ref>Published in 2010, research by [http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/news/zimbabwe-s-land-reform-ten-years-on-new-study-dispels-the-myths Ian Scoones] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225104119/http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/news/zimbabwe-s-land-reform-ten-years-on-new-study-dispels-the-myths |date=25 December 2010 }} on land reform in Masvingo, Zimbabwe.</ref><ref>GDP percentage growth 2010 and [http://www.zddt.org/zimbabwe-economy-1108.html Tobabcco auctions 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213073827/http://www.zddt.org/zimbabwe-economy-1108.html |date=13 December 2010 }}</ref>

Zimbabwe also suffered from a crippling inflation rate, as the [[Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe]] had a policy of printing money to satisfy government debt. This policy caused the inflation rate to increase from 32% in 1998 to 11,200,000% in 2007. Monetary aid by the [[International Monetary Fund]] was suspended due to the Zimbabwe government's defaulting on past loans, its inability to stabilise its own economy, its inability to stem corruption and its failure to advance human rights.<ref name="cia.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/zi.html#Econ|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|access-date=15 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118013742/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/zi.html#Econ|archive-date=18 November 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2009, Zimbabwe abandoned its currency, relying instead on foreign currencies.<ref>BBC News, 29 January 2009: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7859033.stm Zimbabwe abandons its currency] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905024625/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7859033.stm |date=5 September 2011 }}</ref>

In the 2008 elections, [[Mugabe]] garnered 41%, [[Simba Makoni]] 10% and [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] 48% of the votes cast for president, forcing a runoff election called by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC). In the months leading to the run-off, instances of extreme violence between the two major parties (ZANU PF and MDC) led Tsvangirai to withdraw from the election. In February 2009, a power-sharing accord was reached which resulted in the [[Zimbabwe Government of National Unity of 2009]]. The accord was, essentially, to create the position of "Prime Minister" for Tsvangirai, who served in that role from 2009 to 2013. Mugabe retained the title of President.

===Media===

The main newspapers were the ''[[Rhodesia Herald]]'' in [[Harare|Salisbury]] and ''[[The Chronicle (Zimbabwe)|The Chronicle]]'' in [[Bulawayo]]. Following UDI, in 1976, the state-run [[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation|Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (RBC)]] took over the privately owned [[Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation#Television|Rhodesian Television (RTV)]] service, in which it had previously acquired a 51 per cent stake.<ref>{{cite book|author=John R. Bittner|title=Broadcasting: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7MsAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Prentice-Hall International|page=263}}</ref>
Among the news magazines published in Rhodesia under UDI were the ''[[Illustrated Life Rhodesia]]'', while ''The Valiant Years'' by Beryl Salt told the history of Rhodesia from 1890 to 1978 entirely through the medium of facsimile reproduction of articles and headlines from Rhodesian newspapers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Beryl Salt|title=The Valiant years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qpBAAAAYAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Galaxie Press|access-date=19 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107182030/https://books.google.com/books?id=3qpBAAAAYAAJ|archive-date=7 November 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Sports===

Since Rhodesia was a former colony of the United Kingdom, all of the sports that were born in the United Kingdom enjoyed considerable popularity in Rhodesia; especially [[cricket]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[association football|football]], [[netball]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[lawn bowls]], [[field hockey]], etc. Just like neighbouring South Africa, Rhodesia was barred from both competing against and participating with [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] member countries.
