On 12 August 2015, the leader of the Indian National Congress, [[Mallikarjun Kharge]], moved an Adjournment Motion in the lower house seeking the resignation of Sushma Swaraj due to her alleged conduct in this regard. Initially, the motion was rejected by the Speaker, but it was accepted on Swaraj's insistence. Intervening in the motion, Swaraj clarified that Lalit Modi's right of residency was not cancelled, since the [[Enforcement Directorate]] did not file an extradition request. The Adjournment Motion was subsequently rejected with a voice vote.
Sushma Swaraj was heavily criticised in 2014 when she urged Prime Minister Modi to declare the [[Bhagavad Gita]] as the national book of India.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/no-offence-to-bhagvad-gita-but-we-already-have-a-national-testament-1839181.html# |title=No offence to Bhagvad Gita, but we already have a national testament |access-date=30 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430182804/https://www.firstpost.com/india/no-offence-to-bhagvad-gita-but-we-already-have-a-national-testament-1839181.html# |archive-date=30 April 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>
