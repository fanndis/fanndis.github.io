===Baybay Ilog===

Baybay Ilog (Sagip Ilog) is a project of Department of Tourism and Congresswoman Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://50.28.66.118/pampanga/local-news/2012/06/17/sagip-ilog-phase-b-track-rainy-season-227310 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121206022728/http://50.28.66.118/pampanga/local-news/2012/06/17/sagip-ilog-phase-b-track-rainy-season-227310 |archivedate=2012-12-06 }}</ref>

In the Baybay Ilog, Bye-bye Basura project,<ref>{{cite web|title=The River Cruise to Bayanihan Spirit -- Baybay Ilog, Bye-bye Basura for the Lubao-Sasmuan River Cruise|url=http://digitista.blogspot.com/2011/06/river-cruise-to-bayanihan-spirit.html|publisher=Tatak Digitista|accessdate=12 December 2012|date=June 19, 2011}}</ref> officials and volunteers gathered at the Banqueruan Port in San Nicolas 1st, Lubao where the clean-up drive started.  After a brief program, the whole contingent coursed the river, checked the preparation of the communities and conducted the river clean-up. The Lubao-Sasmuan River was one of the ecosystems heavily affected when Mount Pinatubo erupted 20 years ago. With this project coinciding with the anniversary of the said volcanic eruption and our country's independence day celebration, the people from Lubao and Sasmuan are looking at it as a liberation from the dreaded effects of the said natural disaster which, through tourism, will pave the way for the rise to progress of the said communities.  Once again, the river is resuming its role, as a driving factor for the growth of a civilization.

The symbolic river clean-up dubbed as “Baybay-Ilog, Bye-bye Basura”, is the first step in preparing the people in 17 identified Barangays that will benefit from the Pampanga bayou river cruise project spearheaded by the local government units of Sasmuan and Lubao in cooperation with the Provincial government of Pampanga and the second district congressional office of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lakbayan cheers tours in Lubao-and Pampanga|url=http://manualtolyf.blogspot.com/2011/06/lakbayan-cheers-tours-in-lubao-and.html|publisher=Manual To Lyf|accessdate=12 December 2012|date=June 18, 2011}}</ref> River Clean-up held last June 12, 2011. This event mobilized more than 700 volunteers from Sasmuan and Lubao for ground and boat contingents. With the support of the Local Government Units of Sasmuan and Lubao, Community Volunteers and Social Preparation Group of Pampanga Bayou Development Project, this was really an astounding success.

700 volunteers from 13 coastal barangays boarded participating boats at the Banqueruan banca port at the town of San Nicolas, Lubao to participate in the symbolic river cleanup shortly after the sun rose on an otherwise lazy Sunday morning. Armed with cleaning tools, the residents carefully rid the river of wastes in preparation for the formal launch of the town's newest tourist attraction – the Pampanga river bayou cruise. Prior to the river cleanup, Christian Narito, project leader of the social preparation phase of the Pampanga Wetlands Development Project, said the identified 17 barangay communities located along the cruise route had earlier been educated about the benefits tourism could bring into the communities. “People within and around the area participated in determining how will they react or be affected by any major development planned within their area of residence. We helped them identify their strengths and how they could contribute to the river cruise project,” Narito said.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pampanga rising from Pinatubo ashes|url=http://mb.com.ph/articles/323252/pampanga-rising-pinatubo-ashes#.UMjaReQ73fE|work=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=12 December 2012|author=Jenny F.
