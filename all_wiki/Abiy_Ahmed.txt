== Military career ==
As a teenager and in early 1991,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Endeshaw |first1=Dawit |title=The rise of Abiy "Abiyot" Ahmed |url=https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/rise-abiy-abiyot-ahmed |accessdate=25 March 2019 |newspaper=The Reporter |date=31 March 2018 |quote=For some time the EPRDF, was in talks with the OLF; in fact, the later was part of the then transitional government. OLF was, at the time, very popular in Oromia region. However, the peaceful talks failed to bear fruit as things turn to become violent. That was when alternative forces like the Oromo People's Democratic Organization (OPDO) came to the fore.<br /> According to people who witnessed that critical period, the OLF had strong support in Agaro like most parts of Oromia region (No statistical evidence exists to support this claim).<br /> It was at that time that Abiy's family was directly affected by the political transition in the country. Abiy's father and his eldest son, Kedir Ahmed, were arrested for some time.<br /> Unfortunately, Kedir was killed during that time in what was believed to be a politically motivated assassination, according to people close to the family.<br /> By the time, Agaro, which now has a population of, 41,085, was believed to be a stronghold of the OLF.<br /> "I think losing his brother at that age was a turning point in Abiy's life," Miftah Hudin Aba Jebel, a childhood friend of Abiy, told The Reporter. "I mean we were young and I remember one night Abiy asking me to join the struggle," he recalls. "To be honest, it was difficult for me to understand what he was saying."<br /> According to multiple sources, Abiy joined the struggle during early 1991, just a few months before the downfall of the military regime, almost at the age of 15.<br /> "By the time we were teenagers; Abiy, another young man by the name Komitas, who was a driver for Abadula Gemeda at the time, and myself joined the OPDO," Getish Mamo, the then member of OPDO's music band called Bifttu Oromia, told The Reporter. "We were also close with Abadula Gemeda." Abadula was one of the founders of the OPDO and current speaker of the House of People's Representatives.<br /> Abiy, at the time, was working as a radio operator, according to Getish.}}</ref> he joined the armed struggle against the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia|regime]] of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] after the death of his oldest brother. He did so as a member of [[Oromo Democratic Party|ODP (Oromo Democratic Party)]], which at that time was a tiny organization of only around 200 fighters in the large coalition army of about 100,000 fighters that resulted in the regime's fall later that year.<ref name="prelude" /><ref name="abiyot" /><ref name=":0">{{cite web |website=ZeHabesha TV |title=Dr Abiy Ahmed interview with Amhara TV |date=21 November 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRTTnLIwghQ |accessdate=25 March 2019 |via=YouTube |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401171617/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRTTnLIwghQ |archive-date=1 April 2019 }}</ref> As there were only so few ODP fighters in an army with its core of about 90,000 [[Tigrayans]], Abiy quickly had to learn the [[Tigrinya language]].

After the fall of the Derg, he took formal military training from Assefa Brigade in [[Welega Province|West Wollega]] and was stationed there. Later on in 1993 he became a soldier in the now Ethiopian National Defense Force and worked mostly in the intelligence and communications departments. In 1995, after the [[Rwandan genocide]], he was deployed as a member of the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|United Nations Peace Keeping Force (UNAMIR)]], Kigali, [[Kigali|Rwanda]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.borkena.com/2018/01/11/dr-abiy-ahmed-speech/ |title=Dr. Abiy Ahmed's must listen speech on knowledge, ideas and concepts |date=11 January 2018 |website=Borkena.com |access-date=18 February 2018}}</ref> In the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War|Ethio-Eritrea War]] between 1998 and 2000, he led an intelligence team to discover positions of the [[Eritrean Defence Forces]].<ref name="BBC50013273">{{cite news |title=Nobel Peace Prize: Ethiopia PM Abiy Ahmed wins |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-50013273 |agency=BBC News |date=11 October 2019}}</ref>

In 2008, Abiy was one of the co-founders of the Ethiopian Information Network Security Agency (INSA), where he worked in different positions.<ref name="abiyot" /> For two years, he was acting director of INSA due to the director's [[leave of absence]].<ref name="abiyot" /> In this capacity, he was board member of several government agencies working on information and communications, like [[Ethio telecom|Ethio Telecom]] and [[Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation|Ethiopian Television]]. He attained the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel|Lieutenant Colonel]]<ref name="cve" /><ref name="prelude" /> before deciding in 2010 to leave the military and his post as deputy director of INSA ([[Information Network Security Agency]]) to become a [[politician]].

== Political career ==

=== Member of Parliament ===
Abiy started his political career as a member of the [[Oromo Democratic Party|ODP (Oromo Democratic Party)]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.opdo.org.et/About%20Us.htm |title=About Us |website=Oromo Democratic Party |access-date=19 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317114901/http://www.opdo.org.et/About%20Us.htm |archive-date=17 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The ODP is the ruling party in [[Oromia Region]] since 1991 and also one of four coalition parties of the ruling coalition in Ethiopia, the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front|EPRDF (Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front)]]. He became a member of the central committee of ODP and congress member of the Executive Committee of the EPRDF – in quick succession.<ref name="prelude" />
In the 2010 national election, Abiy represented the [[woreda]] of [[Agaro]] and became an elected member of the [[House of Peoples' Representatives]], the lower chamber of the Ethiopian [[Federal Parliamentary Assembly]]. Before and during his time of parliamentary service, there were several religious clashes among Muslims and Christians in [[Jimma Zone|Jimma zone]]. Some of these confrontations turned violent and resulted in the loss of life and property. Abiy, as an elected member of parliament took a proactive role in working with several religious institutions and elders to bring about reconciliation in the zone. He helped set up a forum entitled "Religious Forum for Peace"'','' an outcome of the need to devise a sustainable resolution mechanism to restore peaceful Muslim-Christian community interaction in the region.<ref name="cve" />

In 2014, during his time in parliament, Abiy became the director-general of a new and in 2011 founded Government Research Institute called [[Science and Technology Information Center (Ethiopia)|Science and Technology Information Center (STIC)]].<ref name="abiyot" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite web |url=http://www.stic.gov.et/about-us |title=About STIC |website=Stic.gov.et |access-date=18 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219210734/http://www.stic.gov.et/about-us |archive-date=19 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The following year, Abiy became an executive member of ODP.

=== Rise to power ===
Starting from 2015, Abiy became one of the central figures in the violent fight against illegal [[land grabbing]] activities in Oromia Region and especially around [[Addis Ababa]]. Although the Addis Ababa Master Plan at the heart of the land-grabbing plans was stopped in 2016, the disputes continued for some time resulting in injuries and deaths.<ref name="aamp">{{cite web |url=http://p.dw.com/p/2vBBQ |title=Ethiopia: Who is new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali? |date=29 March 2018 |website=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> It was this fight against land-grabbing, that finally boosted Abiy Ahmed's political career, brought him into the spotlight and allowed him to climb the political ladder.<ref name="prelude" />

In October 2015, Abiy became the Ethiopian [[Ministry of Science and Technology, Ethiopia|Minister of Science and Technology (MoST)]], a post which he left after only 12 months. From October 2016 on, Abiy served as Deputy President of [[Oromia Region]] as part of the team of Oromia Region's president [[Lemma Megersa]] while staying a member of the Ethiopian Federal House of Peoples' Representatives.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.ena.gov.et/en/index.php/economy/item/3082-oromia-committed-to-support-domestic-investors-chief-administrator-lemma-megersa |title=Oromia Committed to Support Domestic Investors: Chief Administrator Lemma Megersa |website=ena.gov.et |access-date=18 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033125/http://www.ena.gov.et/en/index.php/economy/item/3082-oromia-committed-to-support-domestic-investors-chief-administrator-lemma-megersa |archive-date=20 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Abiy Ahmed also became the head of the Oromia Urban Development and Planning Office.

As head of the [[Oromo Democratic Party|ODP Secretariat]] from October 2017, Abiy crossed over religious and ethnic divides to facilitate the formation of a new alliance between [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and the [[Amhara people|Amhara]] groups, both making up two thirds of the 100 million Ethiopian population.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/118697174971952/videos/614501718724826/ |title=Amhara Mass Media Agency |website=Facebook.com |access-date=19 February 2018}}</ref>

In early 2018, many political observers considered Abiy and Lemma Megersa as the most popular politicians within the Oromo community, as well as other Ethiopian communities.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Ethiopia-new-prime-minister/2558-4308896-5gwocw/index.html |title=Who will become Ethiopia's new prime minister and how? |date=17 February 2018 |newspaper=[[The EastAfrican]] |access-date=19 February 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/ethiopias-state-emergency-20-180219112158956.html |title=Ethiopia's state of emergency 2.0 |last=Allo |first=Awol K. |website=Al Jazeera |access-date=20 February 2018}}</ref> This came after several years of unrest in Ethiopia.

Until early 2018, Abiy continued to serve as head of the ODP secretariat and of the Oromia Housing and Urban Development Office and as Deputy President of Oromia Region. He left all these posts after his election as the leader of the [[EPRDF]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/movers-and-shakers |title=Movers and Shakers!!! |first=Dawit |last=Endeshaw |date=4 November 2017 |newspaper=The Reporter |access-date=20 February 2018}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite news |url=http://www.ethpress.gov.et/herald/index.php/technology/item/8472-exciting-opportunity-for-investors-in-oromia-state |title=Exciting opportunity for investors in Oromia State |newspaper=[[Ethiopian Herald]] |access-date=19 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033118/http://www.ethpress.gov.et/herald/index.php/technology/item/8472-exciting-opportunity-for-investors-in-oromia-state |archive-date=20 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== EPRDF leadership election ===
Following three years of protest and unrest, on 15 February 2018 the Ethiopian Prime Minister, [[Hailemariam Desalegn]], announced his resignation – which included his resignation from the post of EPRDF Chairman.
Historically, the incoming EPRDF Chairman is the next Prime Minister. The EPRDF Chairman on the other hand is one of the heads of the four parties that make up the ruling coalition: [[Oromo Democratic Party|ODP]], [[Amhara Democratic Party|ADP]], [[Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement|SEPDM]] and [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front|TPLF]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Abiy Ahmed elected as chairman of Ethiopia's ruling coalition |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/abiy-ahmed-elected-chairman-ethiopia-ruling-coalition-180327201015850.html |accessdate=11 October 2019 |work=www.aljazeera.com |date=28 March 2018}}</ref>

Hailemariam's resignation triggered the first ever contested leadership election among EPRDF coalition members to replace him. A lot of political observers made Lemma Megersa (the ODP Chairman) and Abiy Ahmed the front-runners to become the Leader of the ruling coalition and eventually [[Prime Minister of Ethiopia]]. Despite being the clear favorite for the general public, Lemma Megersa was not a member of the national parliament, a requirement to become Prime Minister as required by the Ethiopian constitution. Therefore, Lemma Megersa was excluded from the leadership race.<ref name="Cameroun">{{cite web |title=Ethiopia: Dr. Abiy Ahmed tipped to become next PM |url=https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/ethiopia-dr-abiy-ahmed-tipped-to-become-next-pm/ |website=Journal du Cameroun |date=23 February 2018}}</ref> On 22 February 2018, Lemma Megersa's party, ODP, called for an emergency executive committee meeting and replaced him as Chairman of ODP with Abiy Ahmed, who was a Member of Parliament. Some observers saw that as a strategic move by the ODP to retain its leadership role within the coalition and to promote Abiy Ahmed to become Prime Minister.<ref name="EritreaHub" />

On 1 March 2018, the 180 EPRDF executive committee members started their meeting to elect the leader of the party. Each of the four parties sent in 45 members. The contest for the leadership was among Abiy Ahmed of ODP, [[Demeke Mekonnen]], the Deputy Prime Minister and ADP leader, [[Shiferaw Shigute]] as Chairman of SEPDM and [[Debretsion Gebremichael]] as the Leader of TPLF. Despite being the overwhelming favorite by the majority of Ethiopians, Abiy Ahmed faced major opposition from TPLF and SEPDM members during the leadership discussions.<ref>{{cite news |title=Seven people who could be Ethiopia's next leader |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-43414557 |accessdate=11 October 2019 |work=BBC News |date=16 March 2018}}</ref>

On 27 March 2018, a few hours before the beginning of the leadership elections, Demeke Mekonnen, who had been seen as the major opponent to Abiy Ahmed, dropped out of the race. Many observers saw this as an endorsement of Abiy Ahmed. Demeke was then approved as Deputy Prime Minister for another term. Following Demeke's exit, Abiy Ahmed received a presumably unanimous vote from both the ADP and ODP executive members, with 18 additional votes in a secret ballot coming from elsewhere. By midnight, Abiy Ahmed was declared Chairman of the ruling coalition in Ethiopia, the EPRDF, and was considered as the Prime Minister Designate of Ethiopia by receiving 108 votes while Shiferaw Shigute received 58 and Debretsion Gebremichael received 2 votes.<ref name="chair" /> On 2 April 2018, Abiy Ahmed was elected as Prime Minister of Ethiopia by the House of Representatives and sworn in.<ref name="16th" />

== Prime Minister of Ethiopia ==
On 2 April 2018, Abiy was confirmed and sworn in by the Ethiopian parliament as [[Prime Minister of Ethiopia]]. During his acceptance speech, he promised political reform; to promote the unity of Ethiopia and unity among the peoples of Ethiopia; to reach out to the Eritrean government to resolve the ongoing Eritrean–Ethiopian border conflict after the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]] and to also reach out to the political opposition inside and outside of Ethiopia. His acceptance speech sparked optimism and received an overwhelmingly positive reaction from the Ethiopian public including the opposition groups inside and outside Ethiopia. Following his speech, his popularity and support across the country reached an historical high and some political observers argued that Abiy was overwhelmingly more popular than the ruling party coalition, the EPRDF.<ref name="chair" />

On 30 May 2018, it was announced the ruling party would amend the country's "draconian" anti-terrorism law, widely perceived as a tool of political repression. On 1 June 2018, Abiy announced the government would seek to end the state of emergency two months in advance of the expiration its six-month tenure, citing an improved domestic situation. On 4 June 2018, Parliament approved the necessary legislation, ending the state of emergency.<ref name="end_of_SOE" /> In his first briefing to the [[House of Peoples' Representatives]] in June 2018, Abiy countered criticism of his government's release of convicted "terrorists" which according to the opposition is just a name the [[EPRDF]] gives you if you are a part or even meet the "opposition".

Aside from representing an ideological shift with respect to views on the degree of government control over the economy, the move was seen as a pragmatic measure aimed at improving the country's dwindling [[foreign-exchange reserves]], which by the end of the 2017 fiscal year were equal in value to less than two months worth of imports, as well as easing its growing [[sovereign debt]] load.<ref name="privatization_hornaffairs">{{cite news |last1=Berhane |first1=Daniel |title=Ethiopia to embark on major privatization push |url=https://hornaffairs.com/2018/06/05/breaking-ethiopia-to-embark-on-major-privatization/ |accessdate=5 June 2018 |website=Horn Affairs |date=5 June 2018}}</ref><ref name="econ_lib" />

In June 2018, he met with Egyptian President [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] in Cairo and, separately, brokered a meeting in Addis Ababa between the South Sudanese president [[Salva Kiir]] and rebel leader [[Riek Machar]] in an attempt to encourage peace talks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Maasho |first1=Aaron |title=South Sudan's president and rebel leader meet for peace talks |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/ethiopiaNews/idAFL8N1TM0F8 |accessdate=25 July 2018 |website=Reuters |date=20 June 2018}}</ref>

==== Djibouti and port agreements ====

Since taking power Abiy has pursued a policy of expanding landlocked Ethiopia's access to ports in the Horn of Africa region. Shortly before his assumption of office it was announced that the Ethiopian government would take a 19% stake in [[Berbera Port]] in the unrecognized [[Republic of Somaliland]] as part of a joint venture with [[DP World]].<ref name="AJ_Berbera">{{cite web |title=Ethiopia to join Somaliland, UAE port development venture |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/ethiopia-join-somaliland-uae-port-development-venture-180301151054778.html |accessdate=6 June 2018 |website=[[Al Jazeera]] |agency=Reuters |date=1 March 2018}}</ref> In May 2018, Ethiopia signed an agreement with the government of Djibouti to take an equity stake in the [[Port of Djibouti]], enabling Ethiopia to have a say in the port's development and the setting of port handling fees.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Maasho |first1=Aaron |title=Ethiopia to take stake in Port of Djibouti, its trade gateway -state media |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-djibouti/ethiopia-to-take-stake-in-port-of-djibouti-its-trade-gateway-state-media-idUSL8N1S81QA |accessdate=11 October 2019 |work=Reuters |date=1 May 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

Two days later a similar agreement was signed with the Sudanese government granting Ethiopia an ownership stake in the [[Port Sudan|Port of Port Sudan]]. The Ethio-Djibouti agreement grants the Djiboutian government the option of taking stakes in state-owned Ethiopian firms in return, such as the [[Ethiopian Airlines]] and [[Ethio Telecom]].<ref name="Reuters_port_Sudan">{{cite web |last1=Maasho |first1=Aaron |title=Ethiopia to take a stake in Sudan's main sea gateway port |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-sudan/ethiopia-to-take-a-stake-in-sudans-main-sea-gateway-port-idUSKBN1I41R1 |accessdate=6 June 2018 |website=Reuters |date=3 May 2018}}</ref> This in turn was followed shortly thereafter by an announcement that Abiy and Kenyan President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] had reached an agreement for the construction of an Ethiopian logistics facility at [[Lamu]] Port as part of the [[Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor]] (LAPSSET) project.<ref name="Lamu_logistics">{{cite news |last1=Omondi |first1=George |title=Ethiopia gets Lamu land to cut reliance on Port of Djibouti |url=https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/economy/Ethiopia-gets-Lamu-cut-reliance--Djibouti/3946234-4551732-view-asAMP-10mft3y/index.html |accessdate=6 June 2018 |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] |date=10 May 2018}}</ref>

The potential normalization of [[Ethiopia-Eritrea relations]] likewise opens the possibility for Ethiopia to resume using the Ports of [[Massawa]] and [[Asseb]], which, prior to the Ethio-Eritrean conflict, were its main ports, which would be of particular benefit to the northern region of [[Tigray Region|Tigray]].<ref name="econ_lib" /> All these developments would reduce Ethiopian reliance on Djibouti's port which, since 1998, has handled almost all of Ethiopia's maritime traffic.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Djibouti City – Addis Ababa Transit and Transport Corridor: Turning Diagnostics into Action |url=https://unctad.org/en/pages/PublicationWebflyer.aspx?publicationid=2299 |publisher=UNCTAD}}</ref><ref name="Reuters_port_Sudan" />

==== Eritrea ====

Upon taking office, Abiy stated his willingness to negotiate an end to the Ethio-Eritrean conflict. In June 2018, it was announced that the government had agreed to hand over the disputed border town of [[Badme]] to Eritrea, thereby complying with the terms of the 2000 [[Algiers Agreement (2000)|Algiers Agreement]] to bring an end to the state of tension between Eritrea and Ethiopia that had persisted despite the end of hostilities during the [[Ethiopia-Eritrea War]].<ref name="econ_lib" /> Ethiopia had until then rejected the international boundary commission's ruling awarding Badme to Eritrea, resulting in a [[frozen conflict]] (popularly termed a policy of "no war, but no peace") between the two states.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lyons |first1=Terrence |title=The Ethiopia-Eritrea Conflict and the Search for Peace in the Horn of Africa |journal=Review of African Political Economy |date=2009 |volume=36 |issue=120 |pages=167–180 |issn=0305-6244|jstor=27756259 |doi=10.1080/03056240903068053 |s2cid=154642333 }}</ref>

During the national celebration on 20 June 2018, the president of Eritrea, [[Isaias Afwerki]], accepted the peace initiative put forward by Abiy and suggested that he would send a delegation to Addis Ababa. On 26 June 2018, Eritrean Foreign Minister [[Osman Saleh Mohammed]] visited Addis Ababa in the first Eritrean high-level delegation to Ethiopia in over two decades.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eritrean officials visit Ethiopia for first time in 20 years |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44619094 |accessdate=9 July 2018 |website=[[BBC News]] |date=26 June 2018}}</ref>

In [[Asmara]], on 8 July 2018, Abiy became the first Ethiopian leader to meet with an Eritrean counterpart in over two decades, in the [[2018 Eritrea–Ethiopia summit]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ethiopia's PM Abiy Ahmed in Eritrea for landmark visit |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/ethiopia-pm-abiy-ahmed-eritrea-landmark-visit-180708083000438.html |accessdate=9 July 2018 |website=Al Jazeera English |date=8 July 2018}}</ref> The very next day, the two signed a "Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship" declaring an end to tensions and agreeing, amongst other matters, to re-establish diplomatic relations; reopen direct telecommunication, road, and aviation links; and facilitate Ethiopian use of the ports of [[Massawa]] and [[Asseb]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shabait.com/news/local-news/26639-joint-declaration-of-peace-and-friendship-between-eritrea-and-ethiopia |title=Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship between Eritrea and Ethiopia |date=9 July 2018 |website=Eritrean Ministry of Information |access-date=6 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="Giddy_excitement">{{cite web |last1=Dahir |first1=Abdi Latif |title=The giddy excitement that marked Ethiopia and Eritrea's historic summit |url=https://qz.com/1323496/ethiopia-eritrea-re-establish-ties-as-abiy-ahmed-isaias-afwerki-meet/ |accessdate=9 July 2018 |website=Quartz |date=9 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ethiopia and Eritrea declare war 'has come to an end' |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/ethiopia-eritrea-sign-declaration-peace-friendship-180709101214478.html |accessdate=9 July 2018 |website=Al Jazeera English |date=9 July 2018}}</ref> Abiy was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2019 for his efforts in ending the war.<ref name= NOBEL /> 

In practice, the agreement has been described as "largely unimplemented". Critics say not much has changed between the two nations.

The dispute between Egypt and [[Ethiopia]] over the [[Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam]] has become a national preoccupation in both countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=Row over Africa's largest dam in danger of escalating, warn scientists |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02124-8 |work=Nature |date=15 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=An Egyptian cyber attack on Ethiopia by hackers is the latest strike over the Grand Dam |url=https://qz.com/africa/1874343/egypt-cyber-attack-on-ethiopia-is-strike-over-the-grand-dam/ |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |date=27 June 2020}}</ref> Ahmed has warned: "No force can stop Ethiopia from building a dam.

After the murder of activist, singer and political icon [[Hachalu Hundessa]] ignited violence across [[Addis Ababa]] and other Ethiopian cities, Abiy hinted, without obvious suspects or clear motives for the killing, that Hundessa may have been murdered by Egyptian security agents acting on orders from [[Cairo]] to stir up trouble.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title=As Ethiopians Take to the Streets to Protest a Musician's Murder, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Is Stuck in a Precarious Position|url=https://time.com/5864684/ethiopia-abiy-ahmed-hachalu-hundessa/|access-date=2020-07-11|website=Time}}</ref> An Egyptian diplomat responded by saying that Egypt "has nothing to do with current tensions in Ethiopia".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cairo has 'nothing to do' with current tensions in Ethiopia: Egyptian diplomat |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/373676/Egypt/Politics-/Cairo-has-%E2%80%98nothing-to-do%E2%80%99-with-current-tensions-in.aspx|access-date=2020-07-11|website=Ahram Online|language=en}}</ref> [[Ian Bremmer]] wrote in a [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] article that Prime Minister Abiy "may just be looking for a [[scapegoat]] that can unite Ethiopians against a perceived common enemy".<ref name=":5" />

=== Religious harmony ===
Ethiopia is a country of various religious groups, primarily Christian and Muslim communities. Both inter-religious and intra-religious divisions and conflicts were a major concern, where both the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and the Ethiopian Islamic Council experienced religious and administrative divisions and conflicts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Premier meets with Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Holy Synod |url=https://fanabc.com/english/2019/09/premier-meets-with-ethiopian-orthodox-tewahedo-church-holy-synod/ |accessdate=11 October 2019 |work=[[FBC (Fana Broadcasting Corporate S.C.)]] |date=6 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Ethiopian PM attends iftar with Muslim community |url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/ethiopian-pm-attends-iftar-with-muslim-community/1484949 |accessdate=11 October 2019 |work=[[Anadolu Agency]] |date=22 May 2019}}</ref> In 2018, he was given a special "peace and reconciliation" award by the Ethiopian Church for his work in reconciling rival factions within the church.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rahman Alfa Shaban |first1=Abdur |title=Photos: Ethiopia PM dedicates award to agents of democratic change |url=https://www.africanews.com/2018/09/10/photos-ethiopia-pm-dedicates-award-to-agents-of-democratic-change/ |accessdate=11 October 2019 |work=Africanews |date=10 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Security sector reform ===
[[File:Abiy Ahmed parade 2019.jpg|thumb|Ahmed with military commanders in February 2019]]
In June 2018, Abiy, speaking to senior commanders of the [[Ethiopian National Defense Force]] (ENDF) declared his intention to carry out reforms of the military to strengthen its effectiveness and professionalism, with the view of limiting its role in politics. This followed renewed calls both within Ethiopia and from international human rights groups, namely [[Amnesty International]], to dissolve highly controversial regional militias such as the [[Liyyu]] force.<ref name="military_reform">{{cite web |last1=Mumbere |first1=Daniel |title=Ethiopia PM wants a more professional army, equipped for modern warfare |url=http://www.africanews.com/2018/06/02/ethiopia-pm-wants-a-more-professional-army-equipped-for-modern-warfare// |accessdate=5 June 2018 |website=Africa News |date=2 June 2018}}</ref> This move is considered likely to face resistance from [[TPLF]] hardliners, who occupy much of the military high command.<ref name="rally_PM">{{cite web |last1=Woldegiorgis |first1=Dawit |title=Let Us Rally Around PM Abiy Ahmed for a Peaceful Transition |url=https://ecadforum.com/2018/05/31/ethiopia-let-us-rally-around-pm-abiy-ahmed-for-a-peaceful-transition/ |accessdate=5 June 2018 |website=ECAD Forum |date=31 May 2018}}</ref>

Notably, he has also called for the eventual reconstitution of the [[Ethiopian Navy]], dissolved in 1996 in the aftermath of Eritrea's secession after an extraterritorial sojourn in [[Djibouti]], saying that "we should build our naval force capacity in the future."<ref name="new_navy">{{cite web |last1=Maasho |first1=Aaron |title=Landlocked Ethiopia plans new navy as part of military reforms |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-military/landlocked-ethiopia-plans-new-navy-as-part-of-military-reforms-idUSKCN1IZ0ML |website=[[Reuters]] |date=3 June 2016}}</ref> It was reported that this move would appeal to nationalists still smarting from the country's loss of its coastline 25 years prior. Ethiopia already has a maritime training institute on [[Lake Tana]] as well as a [[Ethiopian Shipping Lines|national shipping line]].

On 7 June 2018, Abiy carried out a wide-ranging reshuffle of top security officials, replacing ENDF Chief of Staff [[Samora Yunis]] with Lieutenant General [[Se'are Mekonnen]], [[National Intelligence and Security Service]] (NISS) director [[Getachew Assefa]] with Lieutenant General [[Adem Mohammed]], National Security Advisor and former army chief [[Abadula Gemeda]], and [[Sebhat Nega]], one of the founders of the [[TPLF]] and director-general of the Foreign Relations Strategic Research Institute<ref name="retired">{{cite news |title=PM appoints new security chief |url=https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/pm-appoints-new-security-chief |accessdate=7 June 2018 |newspaper=[[The Reporter (Ethiopia)|The Reporter]] |date=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Five high ranking authorities including Sebhat Nega to retire |url=https://www.borkena.com/2018/05/15/five-high-ranking-authorities-including-sebhat-nega-to-retire/ |accessdate=7 June 2018 |website=Borkena |date=15 May 2018}}</ref> Sebhat's retirements had been previously announced that May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethiopiaobserver.com/2018/05/18/amid-eprdf-power-shuffle-sebhat-nega-a-tplf-founder-retires-from-think-tank/|title=Amid EPRDF Reshuffle, Sebhat Nega, a TPLF Founder, Retires from Think Tank|date=18 May 2018|website=Ethiopia Observer|language=en-US|url-status=live|access-date=11 October 2019}}</ref>

=== Grenade attack ===
A large peaceful demonstration was organized in Addis Ababa at [[Meskel Square]] on 23 June 2018 to show support for the new prime minister. Just after Abiy had finished addressing the crowd a grenade was thrown and landed just 17 metres away from where he and other top officials were sitting. Two people were killed and over 165 were injured. Following the attack, 9 police officials were detained, including the deputy police commissioner, Girma Kassa, who was fired immediately. Questions were asked as to how a police car carrying attackers got so close to the prime minister and soon after the car was set alight destroying evidence. After the attack the prime minister addressed the nation on national TV unhurt by the blast and describing it as an "unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united". On the same day the prime minister made an unannounced visit to the Black Lion general hospital to meet victims of the attack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ahmed |first1=Hadra |title=Explosion Hits Rally for Ethiopian Leader |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/world/africa/ethiopia-explosion-abiy.html |accessdate=23 June 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=23 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/ethiopia-pm-abiy-ahmed-killed-addis-ababa-blast-rally-180623075418193.html |title=Ethiopia: Grenade attack caused blast at rally for PM Abiy Ahmed |date=23 June 2018 |website=Al Jazeera |accessdate=24 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-44586187 |title=Lethal grenade attack at Ethiopia rally |date=23 June 2018 |website=BBC News |accessdate=24 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-politics/twenty-people-in-court-in-ethiopia-following-grenade-attack-idUSKBN1JL0V8 |title=Twenty people in court in Ethiopia following grenade attack |date=25 June 2018 |website=Reuters| accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref>

=== Increasing ethnic unrest ===
The internal political power shift has created fears for Tigrayans, and already "simmering anti-Tigrayan sentiments have led to violence" people told [[The New Humanitarian|IRIN]], "from barricading roads and forcibly stopping traffic to looting and attacks on Tigrayan homes and businesses in the Amhara and Oromia regions". Tens of thousands Ethiopian Tigrayans have been displaced from their homes (or killed), due to ethnic based violence, since Abiy assumed office.<ref name="IRINpowerShiftAndFears">{{cite web |url=https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/analysis/2019/02/14/Ethiopia-ethnic-displacement-power-shift-raises-tensions |title= Power shift creates new tensions and Tigrayan fears in Ethiopia |date= 14 February 2019 | website= The New Humanitarian |access-date=11 April 2019 |quote=...Already simmering anti-Tigrayan sentiments have led to violence, people told IRIN, from barricading roads and forcibly stopping traffic to looting and attacks on Tigrayan homes and businesses in the Amhara and Oromia regions. In the Tigray region’s capital of Mekelle, more than 750 kilometers north of the political changes taking place in Addis Ababa, many Tigrayans feel increasingly isolated from fellow Ethiopians. “The rest of the country hates us,” Weyanay Gebremedhn, 25, told IRIN. Despite the reforms, Tigrayans say what hasn’t changed is the narrative that they are responsible by association for the ills of the TPLF. Although he now struggles to find work, 35-year-old Huey Berhe, who does mostly odd jobs to pay the bills, said he felt safer living among his own community in Mekelle. Huey said he had been a student at Jimma University in western Ethiopia, until growing ethnic tensions sparked fights on campus and led to Tigrayans being targeted. “I left my studies at Jimma after the trouble there,” he said. “It was bad – it’s not something I like to discuss.” “There is a lot of [lies] and propaganda, and the TPLF has been made the scapegoat for all vice,” said Gebre Weleslase, a Tigrayan law professor at Mekelle University. He criticised Abiy for not condemning ethnic attacks, which he said had contributed to tens of thousands of Tigrayans leaving Amhara for Tigray in recent years.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-displacement-tracking-matrix-dtm-tigray-region-round-14-november-december |website= ReliefWeb  |title= International Organization for Migration, "Ethiopia: Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Tigray Region, Round 14: November – December 2018 – Summary of Key Findings" |access-date=15 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-displacement-tracking-matrix-dtm-tigray-region-round-11-mayjune-2018  |website= ReliefWeb  |title= International Organization for Migration, "Ethiopia: Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Tigray Region, Round 11: May/June 2018 – Summary of Key Findings"  | access-date=15 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.facebook.com/dimtsiweyane/videos/2332897100262985/ | website= Facebook page of DW-TV  |title= Dimtsi Weyane TV, "Documentary on displaced Tigrayans" |access-date=18 April 2019 }}</ref><ref name="FinancialTimesEthnicRv">{{cite web |url= https://www.ft.com/content/1cbaac04-457f-11e9-a965-23d669740bfb |title= Ethiopian ethnic rivalries threaten Abiy Ahmed's reform agenda |date=27 March 2019 |website=Financial Times |access-date=11 April 2019 |quote=...

Government spokesmen have countered that there are many ex-officials accused of amassing billions in the past decades that are wanted by law enforcement on corruption charges and that many of these defendants come from the ruling Tigrayan elite of the past decades. These legal proceedings are sometimes conflated with ethnic persecution, especially by those ex-officials that fear persecution.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Igunza |first1=Emmanuel |title=Ethiopia's PM takes on the military |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-46221240 |accessdate=11 October 2019 |work=BBC News |date=15 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Political party reform ===
On 21 November 2019, upon approval of [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front|EPRDF ruling coalition]], a new party, [[Prosperity Party]], is formed via merging of three of the four parties that made up the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF) and other five affiliate parties. The parties include the [[Oromo Democratic Party]] (ODP), the [[Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement]] (SEPDM), the [[Amhara Democratic Party]] (ADP), the [[Hareri National League|Harari National League]] (HNL), the [[Ethiopian Somali People's Democratic Party|Ethiopian Somali Peoples Democratic Party]] (ESPDP), the [[Afar National Democratic Party]] (ANDP), the Gambella Peoples Unity Party (GPUP), and the Benishangul Gumuz Peoples Democratic Party (BGPDP). The programs and bylaws of the newly merged party were first approved by the executive committee of EPRDF. Abiy believes that "Prosperity Party is committed to strengthening & applying a true Federal system which recognizes the diversity and contributions of all Ethiopians".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-politics-idUSKBN1XV24H|title=Ethiopia's ruling coalition agrees to form single party ahead of 2020 vote|date=21 November 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=2 January 2020|language=en}}</ref>

=== Tigrayan conflict ===
{{Main|Tigray conflict}}
Hostilities between the central government and the TPLF escalated after TPLF rejected the central government’s authority to govern after October 6, 2020, accusing the central government of violating the [[1995 Constitution of Ethiopia|Ethiopian constitution]] by postponing August 2020 elections to mid-2021 as a result of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia|COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethiopia proposes holding postponed vote in May or June 2021: FANA|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-politics/ethiopia-proposes-holding-postponed-vote-in-may-or-june-2021-fana-idUSKBN27F14A|work=[[Reuters]]|date=30 October 2020|access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref> TPLF, the dominant political party in the [[Tigray Region]], carried out [[2020 Tigray regional election|its own regional elections]], winning all contested seats in the region's parliament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethiopian Region Holds Local Elections in Defiance of Prime Minister|last1=Marks|first1=Simon|last2=Dahir|first2=Abdi Latif|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/world/africa/ethiopia-tigray-elections-abiy-crisis.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 September 2020|access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref>In turn, Abiy Ahmed redirected funding from the top level of the Tigray regional government to lower ranks in a bid to weaken the TPLF party.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ann |first1=Fitz-Gerald |title=Ethiopia is on the brink of a potentially destabilizing war.

Abiy has been described as a "liberal populist" by the academic and journalist [[Abiye Teklemariam]] and the influential Oromo activist [[Jawar Mohammed]]. Journalist [[Michela Wrong]], a longtime observer of Ethiopian politics, has written that he resembles the likes of [[Donald Trump|Trump]] and [[Vladimir Putin]], populists who “use [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] appeals to nationalism to truncate or supplant domestic political debate and institutional processes.”<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wrong|first=Michela|date=2018-09-03|title=Ethiopia, Eritrea and the Perils of Reform|journal=Survival|volume=60|issue=5|pages=49–57|doi=10.1080/00396338.2018.1518369|s2cid=158759969|issn=0039-6338}}</ref> Alemayehu Weldemariam, a U.S.-based Ethiopian lawyer and public intellectual, has called Abiy “an [[Opportunism|opportunistic]] populist jockeying for power on a [[Democratization|democratizing]] platform.”<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Gardner|first=Tom|title=Abiy Ahmed Is Not a Populist|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/05/abiy-ahmed-is-not-a-populist-ethiopia-eprdf-tplf-modi-erdogan-populism/|access-date=2020-07-02|website=Foreign Policy|language=en-US}}</ref> On the other hand, Tom Gardner argues in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' that he's not a populist, but more of a [[Liberal democracy|liberal democrat]]. However, Gardner acknowledges that Abiy has "occasionally used language that can be read as [[Euphemism|euphemistic]] and conspiracy-minded", and might have "exploited the system’s vulnerabilities, such as a pliable media and politicized judiciary, for his own ends."<ref name=":1" />
