In 1986, Cheney, along with 145 Republicans and 31 Democrats, voted against a non-binding Congressional resolution calling on the South African government to release [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison, after the Democrats defeated proposed amendments that would have required Mandela to renounce violence sponsored by the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and requiring it to oust the communist faction from its leadership; the resolution was defeated. Appearing on [[CNN]], Cheney addressed criticism for this, saying he opposed the resolution because the ANC "at the time was viewed as a terrorist organization and had a number of interests that were fundamentally inimical to the United States."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/07/30/talk.wrap/index.html |title=Cheney defends voting record, blasts Clinton on talk-show circuit |publisher=CNN |access-date=December 12, 2007 |date=July 30, 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402101455/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/07/30/talk.wrap/index.html |archive-date=April 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>

President [[George H. W. Bush]] nominated Cheney for the office of [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] immediately after the U.S. Senate failed to confirm [[John Tower]] for that position.<ref name=EB1990YB>{{cite book|first=Charles Johnson|last=Taggart|contribution= Cheney, Richard Bruce|title=1990 Britannica Book of the Year|year=1990|page=85|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Inc.|place=[[Chicago]]|isbn=0-85229-522-7}}</ref> The senate confirmed Cheney by a vote of 92 to 0<ref name="EB1990YB"/> and he served in that office from March 1989 to January 1993. He directed the [[United States invasion of Panama]] and [[Operation Desert Storm]] in the Middle East. In 1991, he was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by Bush.<ref name="1988 hmw"/><ref name="CNN2013-09-21"/> Later that year, he received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national |title=Jefferson Awards FoundationNational – Jefferson Awards Foundation |website=Jeffersonawards.org |access-date=2016-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124043935/http://jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national |archive-date=November 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Cheney has said his time at the Pentagon was the most rewarding period of his public service career, calling it "the one that stands out." In 2014, Cheney recounted that when he met with President [[George H. W. Bush]] to accept the offer, he passed a painting in the private residence entitled ''The Peacemakers,'' which depicted President Lincoln, General Grant, and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. "My great-grandfather had served under William Tecumseh Sherman throughout the war," Cheney said, "and it occurred to me as I was in the room as I walked in to talk to the President about becoming Secretary of Defense, I wondered what he would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the White House with the President talking about taking over the reins of the U.S. military."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/dick-cheney/ |title=Dick Cheney on Conversations with Bill Kristol |website=Conversationswithbillkristol.org |access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref>

===Early tenure===
Cheney worked closely with [[Pete Williams (television correspondent)|Pete Williams]], [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs]], and [[Paul Wolfowitz]], [[Under Secretary of Defense for Policy]], from the beginning of his tenure. He focused primarily on external matters, and left most of the internal DoD management to [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald J. Atwood Jr.|Donald Atwood]].<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/>

===Budgetary practices===
Cheney's most immediate issue as Secretary of Defense was the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate to cut the budget and downsize the military, following the [[Reagan Administration]]'s peacetime defense buildup at the height of the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{cite journal|last= Bartels|first=Larry M.|title=Constituency Opinion and Congressional Policy Making: The Reagan Defense Build Up|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=June 1, 1991|volume=85|issue=2|pages=457–474|issn=0003-0554|jstor=1963169|doi=10.2307/1963169|s2cid=28751110|url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fdee/96153a27e69e49c0947057f712b62f2aa790.pdf}}</ref> As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the [[McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II|Avenger II]] Naval attack aircraft, the [[B-2 Spirit|B-2]] stealth bomber, the [[V-22 Osprey]] tilt-wing [[helicopter]], the [[Aegis destroyer]] and the [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX missile]], totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Charlie Savage]] |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=November 26, 2006 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/11/26/hail_to_the_chief/?page=4 |title=Hail to the chief: Dick Cheney's mission to expand -or 'restore' – the powers of the presidency |access-date=February 26, 2008 |archive-date=May 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512030214/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/11/26/hail_to_the_chief/?page=4 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>
When the 1990 Budget came before Congress in the summer of 1989, it settled on a figure between the Administration's request and the [[House Armed Services Committee]]'s recommendation.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/secdef_histories/bios/cheney.htm |title=Richard B. Cheney:17th Secretary of Defense |access-date=December 12, 2007 |publisher=United States Department of Defense |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040401100903/http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/secdef_histories/bios/cheney.htm |archive-date=April 1, 2004 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>

In subsequent years under Cheney, the proposed and adopted budgets followed patterns similar to that of 1990. Early in 1991, he unveiled a plan to reduce military strength by the mid-1990s to 1.6 million, compared with 2.2 million when he entered office. Cheney's 1993 defense budget was reduced from 1992, omitting programs that Congress had directed the Department of Defense to buy weapons that it did not want, and omitting unrequested reserve forces.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/>

Over his four years as Secretary of Defense, Cheney downsized the military and his budgets showed negative real growth, despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by Congress. The Department of Defense's total obligational authority in current dollars declined from $291 billion to $270 billion. Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent, from about 2.2 million in 1989 to about 1.8 million in 1993.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> Notwithstanding the overall reduction in military spending, Cheney directed the development of a Pentagon plan to ensure U.S. military dominance in the post-Cold War era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb245/index.htm |title="Prevent the Reemergence of a New Rival" – The Making of the Cheney Regional Defense Strategy, 1991–1992 |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |access-date=November 28, 2011 |archive-date=March 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303000951/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb245/index.htm |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>

===Political climate and agenda===
Cheney publicly expressed concern that nations such as [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], and [[North Korea]], could acquire nuclear components after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the [[Warsaw Pact]] obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|North Atlantic Treaty Organization's]] (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/>

Cheney's views on NATO reflected his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social development in the former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting [[General Secretary of the CPSU]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and his successor, [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]].<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Defense Department Report, Wednesday, October 14 (10/14/92) |publisher=Department of Defense |date=October 14, 1992 |url=https://fas.org/news/usa/1992/56297759-56300711.htm |access-date=December 12, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040303004546/https://fas.org/news/usa/1992/56297759-56300711.htm |archive-date=March 3, 2004 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>

Cheney persuaded the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] to allow bases for U.S. ground troops and war planes in the nation. This was an important element of the success of the [[Gulf War]], as well as a lightning-rod for [[Islamist]]s, such as [[Osama bin Laden]], who opposed having non-Muslim armies near their holy sites.<ref name="JINSA"/>

===International situations===
Using [[economic sanctions]] and political pressure, the United States mounted a campaign to drive [[Panama]]nian ruler General [[Manuel Antonio Noriega]] from power after he fell from favor.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> In May 1989, after [[Guillermo Endara]] had been duly elected [[President of Panama]], Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure. In October, Noriega suppressed a [[military coup]], but in December, after soldiers of the [[Panamanian army]] killed a U.S. serviceman, the United States invasion of Panama began under Cheney's direction. The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect U.S. lives and property, and restore Panamanian [[civil liberties]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

In 1991, the [[Somali Civil War]] drew the world's attention. In August 1992, the United States began to provide [[humanitarian assistance]], primarily food, through a military airlift. At President Bush's direction, Cheney dispatched the first of 26,000 U.S. troops to [[Somalia]] as part of the [[Unified Task Force]] (UNITAF), designed to provide security and food relief.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> Cheney's successors as Secretary of Defense, [[Les Aspin]] and [[William J.

====Iraqi invasion of Kuwait====
On August 1, 1990, [[President of Iraq|Iraqi President]] [[Saddam Hussein]] [[Invasion of Kuwait|sent the invading Iraqi forces into neighboring Kuwait]], a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq as part of its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the [[Persian Gulf War]] and it brought worldwide condemnation.<ref name="gulf war pbs">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/cron/ |title=The Gulf War: Chronology |publisher=PBS |access-date=December 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011234650/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/cron/ |archive-date=October 11, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> An estimated 140,000 [[Iraqi troops]] quickly took control of [[Kuwait City]] and moved on to the [[Saudi Arabia]]/Kuwait border.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the [[U.S. Central Command]], headed by General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]], because of its important petroleum reserves.

=====U.S. and world reaction=====

Cheney and Schwarzkopf oversaw planning for what would become a full-scale U.S. military operation. According to General [[Colin Powell]], Cheney "had become a glutton for information, with an appetite we could barely satisfy. He spent hours in the [[National Military Command Center]] peppering my staff with questions."<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/>

Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where [[King Fahd]] requested U.S. military assistance. The United Nations took action as well, passing a series of resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait; the [[UN Security Council]] authorized "all means necessary" to eject Iraq from Kuwait, and demanded that the country withdraw its forces by January 15, 1991.<ref name="gulf war pbs"/> By then, the United States had a force of about 500,000 stationed in Saudi Arabia and the [[Persian Gulf]]. Other nations, including Britain, Canada, France, Italy, [[Syria]], and [[Egypt]], contributed troops, and other allies, most notably Germany and Japan, agreed to provide financial support for the coalition effort, named [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Operation Desert Shield]].<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/>

On January 12, 1991, Congress authorized Bush to use military force to enforce Iraq's compliance with UN resolutions on Kuwait.<ref name="gulf war pbs"/>

=====Military action=====
The first phase of [[Operation Desert Storm]], which began on January 17, 1991, was an air offensive to secure air superiority and attack Iraqi forces, targeting key Iraqi command and control centers, including the cities of [[Baghdad]] and [[Basra]]. Cheney turned most other Department of Defense matters over to Deputy Secretary Atwood and briefed Congress during the air and ground phases of the war.<ref name="Cheney DoD bio"/> He flew with Powell to the region to review and finalize the ground war plans.<ref name="gulf war pbs"/>

After an air offensive of more than five weeks, [[Coalition of the Gulf War|Coalition]] forces launched the ground war on February 24. Within 100 hours, Iraqi forces had been routed from Kuwait and Schwarzkopf reported that the basic objective—expelling Iraqi forces from Kuwait—had been met on February 27.<ref name="gulf war military">{{cite web

Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a "bad idea" and would have led to a "quagmire", explaining that:
<blockquote>
Because if we'd gone to Baghdad we would have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. occupation of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what are you going to put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[C-SPAN]]|date=April 15, 1994|access-date=October 25, 2007|title=Life and Career of Dick Cheney: American Profile Interview|url=http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&products_id=58277-1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026202426/http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&products_id=58277-1|archive-date=October 26, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Jon |last=Garfunkel |url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2007/08/cheney_video_huntthe_tangled_s.html |title=Cheney Video Hunt: The Tangled State of Archived News Footage Online |publisher=Public Broadcasting System |date=August 22, 2007 |access-date=October 25, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104154634/http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2007/08/cheney_video_huntthe_tangled_s.html |archive-date=November 4, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>

==Private sector career==
Between 1987 and 1989, during his last term in Congress, Cheney was a director of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] foreign policy organization.<ref name=cfr>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/about/history/cfr/appendix.html |title=The Council on Foreign Relations from 1921 to 1996 – Historical Roster of Directors and Officers2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207083316/http://www.cfr.org/about/history/cfr/appendix.html |archive-date=February 7, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>

With the new Democratic administration under President [[Bill Clinton]] in [[1992 United States presidential election|January 1993]], Cheney left the Department of Defense and joined the [[American Enterprise Institute]]. He also served a second term as a Council on Foreign Relations director from 1993 to 1995.<ref name=cfr/> From 1995 until 2000, he served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of [[Halliburton]], a [[Fortune 500]] company.

Cheney's record as CEO was subject to some dispute among [[Wall Street]] analysts. A 1998 merger between Halliburton and [[Dresser Industries]] attracted the criticism of some Dresser executives for Halliburton's lack of accounting transparency.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 2000 Campaign; Cheney Has Mixed Record In Business Executive Role |last1=Henriques |first1=Diana B. |last2=Bergman |first2=Lowell |last3=Oppel |first3=Richard A.

In early 2000, while serving as the CEO of Halliburton, Cheney headed then-[[Governor of Texas]] [[George W. Bush]]'s vice-presidential search committee.

A few months before the election Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. This change was necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors to vote for both Bush and Cheney without contravening the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which forbids electors from voting for "an inhabitant of the same state with themselves"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-12|title=Amendment XII.

Cheney campaigned against [[Al Gore]]'s running mate, [[Joseph Lieberman]], in the 2000 presidential election. While the election was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington.

On the morning of July 21, 2007, Cheney once again served as acting president, from 7:16&nbsp;am to 9:21&nbsp;am.

After his term began in 2001, Cheney was occasionally asked if he was interested in the Republican nomination for the 2008 elections. However, he always maintained that he wished to retire upon the expiration of his term and he did not run in the 2008 presidential primaries. The Republicans nominated Arizona Senator [[John McCain]].<ref>{{cite news|date=March 7, 2005 |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/295zkwpw.asp |title=President Cheney? |last=Barnes |first=Fred |work=[[The Weekly Standard]] |volume=10 |number=23 |access-date=December 18, 2007 |archive-date=November 17, 2007 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20071117182647/http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/295zkwpw.asp |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>

Cheney has actively promoted an expansion of the powers of the presidency, saying that the Bush administration's challenges to the laws which Congress passed after Vietnam and [[Watergate]] to contain and oversee the executive branch—the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]], the [[Presidential Records Act]], the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and the [[War Powers Resolution]]—are, in Cheney's words, "a restoration, if you will, of the power and authority of the president".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/books/review/Bazelon-t.html |title=All the President's Powers |last=Brazelon |first=Emily |work=The New York Times |date=November 18, 2007 |access-date=November 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206164110/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/books/review/Bazelon-t.html |archive-date=December 6, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|access-date=February 13, 2008 |url=http://hnn.us/articles/44951.html |title=The Return of the Imperial Presidency: An Interview with Charlie Savage |author=Robin Lindley |publisher=[[History News Network]] |date=January 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918080057/http://hnn.us/articles/44951.html |url-status=live |archive-date=September 18, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>
