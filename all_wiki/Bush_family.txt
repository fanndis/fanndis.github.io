The '''Bush family''' is an American dynastic family that is prominent in the fields of politics, news, sports, entertainment, and business, founded by [[Obadiah Bush]] and Harriet Smith.

Best known for its involvement in politics, the family has held various national and state offices spanning across four generations, including a U.S. Senator, [[Prescott Bush]], a Governor, [[Jeb Bush]], and two U.S. Presidents—one having also served as Vice President, [[George H. W. Bush]], while the other was also a Governor, [[George W. Bush]]. Other family members include a [[National Football League]] (NFL) executive, [[Joe Ellis]], and two nationally known TV personalities, [[Billy Bush]] and [[Jenna Bush Hager]].

[[Peter Schweizer]], author of a biography of the family, has described the Bushes as "the most successful political [[dynasty]] in American history".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://washtimes.com/national/20050119-123016-5212r.htm
