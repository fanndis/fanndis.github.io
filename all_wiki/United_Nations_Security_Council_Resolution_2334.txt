'''United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334''' was adopted on 23 December 2016. It concerns the [[Israeli settlement]]s in "[[Palestinian territories|Palestinian territories occupied since 1967]], including [[East Jerusalem]]".  The resolution passed in a 14–0 vote by members of the [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]] (UNSC). Four members with [[United Nations Security Council veto power]], China, France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, voted for the resolution, but the United States abstained.<ref name=toi>{{cite news|title=Choosing not to veto, Obama lets anti-settlement resolution pass at UN Security Council|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/choosing-not-to-veto-obama-lets-anti-settlement-resolution-pass-at-un-security-council/|accessdate=23 December 2016|work=The Times of Israel}}</ref>

The resolution states that [[Israel]]'s settlement activity constitutes a "flagrant violation" of [[international law]] and has "no legal validity". It demands that Israel stop such activity and fulfill its obligations as an [[Military occupation#The occupying power|occupying power]] under the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].<ref name=resolution_text>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12657.doc.htm |title=Israel's Settlements Have No Legal Validity, Constitute Flagrant Violation of International Law, Security Council Reaffirms: 14 Delegations in Favour of Resolution 2334 (2016) as United States Abstains|publisher=UN|date=23 December 2016 |accessdate=25 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=BBC>{{cite news|title=Israeli settlements: UN Security Council calls for an end|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-38421026|accessdate=23 December 2016|work=BBC News|date=23 December 2016}}</ref>

The previous such resolution, Resolution 465, was adopted by the Security Council in March 1980 (you can read it in full here). That being said, since 1980, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has undergone dramatic changes, the extent of the Israeli settlement enterprise has grown dramatically, and international community's focus on the settlements as a threat to the viability of the two-state solution has also increased markedly."</ref> While the resolution did not include any sanction or coercive measure and was adopted under the non-binding [[Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VI]] of the United Nations Charter, Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' stated it "may have serious ramifications for Israel in general and specifically for the settlement enterprise" in the medium-to-long term.<ref name=BR />

The text was welcomed by much of the [[international community]] in the following days. According to [[Murray McCully]], former Minister of Foreign Affairs for New Zealand, Resolution 2334 reinforces the international community's commitment to a negotiated outcome <ref>{{cite news |title=Murray McCully: Why NZ sponsored the resolution against Israel's settlements|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11780250|publisher=NZHerald|date=January 12, 2017|access-date=April 29, 2020}}</ref> while former Canadian ambassador [[Paul Heinbecker]] noted that, Israeli and Palestinian narratives notwithstanding, resolution 2334 "reflects what the world thinks.

Israel, contrary to the great majority of the participants, disputes the applicability de jure of the Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Court recalls that the Fourth Geneva Convention was ratified by Israel on 6 July 1951 and that Israel is a party to that Convention; that Jordan has also been a party thereto since 29 May 1951; and that neither of the two States has made any reservation that would be pertinent to the present proceedings. The Court observes that the Israeli authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that in fact they generally apply the humanitarian provisions of
the Fourth Geneva Convention within the occupied territories. However, according to Israel’s
position, that Convention is not applicable de jure within those territories because, under Article 2, paragraph 2, it applies only in the case of occupation of territories falling under the sovereignty of a High Contracting Party involved in an armed conflict. Israel explains that the territories occupied by Israel subsequent to the 1967 conflict had not previously fallen under Jordanian sovereignty. The Court notes that, according to the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, when two conditions are fulfilled, namely that there exists an armed conflict (whether or not a state of war has been recognized), and that the conflict has arisen between two contracting parties, then the Convention applies, in particular, in any territory occupied in the course of the conflict by one of the contracting parties. The object of the second paragraph of Article 2, which refers to "occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party", is not to restrict the scope of application of the Convention, as defined by the first paragraph, by excluding therefrom territories not falling under the sovereignty of one of the contracting parties, but simply to making it clear that, even if occupation effected during the conflict met no armed resistance, the Convention is still applicable.</ref>

The UN Security Council previously addressed Israeli settlements in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 446|UN Security Council Resolution 446]] and Resolution 465. The Council also endorsed the [[Road map for peace]], which required a freeze to settlement expansion in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1515|Resolution 1515]].

In February 2011, during [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Barack Obama]]'s first administration, the US used its [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]] to block a similar UN Security Council resolution<ref name="haaretz_analysis">{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.761049|title=Understanding the UN resolution on Israeli settlements: What are the immediate ramifications?|accessdate=24 December 2016|newspaper=Haaretz|date=24 December 2016|last1=Ravid|first1=Barak}}</ref><ref name="toi" /> and settlement activity has grown substantially.

In 1987, the Reagan administration abstained and allowed the passage of UNSCR 605, 14 to 0, which reaffirmed the application of the Geneva Convention (via previous resolutions) and included "Jerusalem" in the "Palestinian and Arab Territories, occupied by Israel since 1967". Sixteen years later, the George W. Bush administration voted in favor of UNSCR 1515, which called—by endorsing the Roadmap for Peace—for a full settlement freeze, including natural growth. In fact, until this latest resolution, Obama had been the only president not to let a resolution critical of Israeli policy pass in the Security Council.</ref>

[[File:United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334.pdf|thumb|right|150px|Resolution text]]
The resolution states that all measures aimed at changing the demographic composition and status of Palestinian territories occupied by Israel, including construction and expansion of settlements, transfer of Israeli settlers, confiscation of land, demolition of homes and displacement of Palestinian civilians are in violation of international humanitarian law, Israel's obligation as the occupying Power according to the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], and previous resolutions.<ref name=resolution_text />

The resolution also condemns all acts of violence against civilians, including terrorism, provocation and destruction.<ref name=resolution_text /> According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', this is "aimed at Palestinian leaders, whom Israel accuses of encouraging attacks on Israeli civilians".<ref name=nytimes /> It reiterates support for the [[two-state solution]] and noted that settlement activities are "imperilling" its viability.<ref name=resolution_text />

The document also "''underlines''" that the UN Security Council "will not recognize any changes to 4 June 1967 lines, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations"; and "''calls"'' upon all states "to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967."<ref name=resolution_text />

== Passage ==
The draft was originally presented by Egypt on the basis of a document prepared by British legal and diplomatic figures working together with the Palestinians,<ref name="BRavid" /> with Britain regarded as the key player in formulating the resolution and pressing for a vote.<ref>Barak Ravid,[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.762151  'Britain Criticizes Kerry’s Speech: Settlements Are Not the Only Issue] [[Haaretz]] 29 December 2016</ref>

High pressures were exerted to avoid the vote. On 22 December, United States President-elect [[Donald Trump]] called on Egyptian president [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] to withdraw the proposal,<ref name=BBC /> and Egypt withdrew the nomination after what its ambassador called an "intense pressure".<ref name=nytimes /> Then on 23 December, the draft was taken up and proposed again by Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela.<ref name=BBC /> Israel unsuccessfully pressured New Zealand to withdraw its support, with Netanyahu telling Foreign Minister [[Murray McCully]] that support for the proposal would be considered by Israel as a "declaration of war".<ref name="BRavid">Barak Ravid, ''[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.761706 Britain Pulled the Strings and Netanyahu Warned New Zealand It Was Declaring War: New Details on Israel's Battle Against the UN Vote]'', [[Haaretz]], 28 December 2016</ref> Britain encouraged New Zealand to keep pushing for a vote. Following a telephone conversation between Netanyahu and [[Vladimir Putin]], the Russian ambassador to the UN [[Vitaly Churkin]] requested that the vote be postponed until after Christmas. His proposal failed to gain any support.<ref name="BRavid" />

The resolution was passed 14 to 0; all members voted for the resolution except for the United States, which abstained.<ref name=nytimes /> The United States Ambassador [[Samantha Power]] explained the abstention by saying that on one hand the United Nations often unfairly targets Israel, that there are important issues unaddressed by the resolution, and that the US did not agree with every word in the text; while on the other hand the resolution reflects facts on the ground, that it reaffirms the consensus that the settlement activity is not legal, and that the settlement activity has gotten "so much worse" as to endanger the viability of the two-state solution.<ref name=powers_statement>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/full-text-of-us-envoy-samantha-powers-speech-after-abstention-on-anti-settlement-vote/|title=Full text of US envoy Samantha Power's speech after abstention on anti-settlement vote|accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=nytimes /><ref name=BBC />

Media and observers contrasted the US decision to abstain with its long-standing tradition of vetoing resolutions targeting Israel over the issues of settlements.<ref name=nytimes />

The resolution was particularly controversial in Israel, given its [[criticism of the Israeli government]].

Netanyahu also declared that: 'The resolution that was passed by the U.N. yesterday is part of the swan song of the old world that is biased against Israel' and questioned the Security Council's priorities given the mounting fatalities in the wars in Syria, the Sudan, and elsewhere in the Middle East.<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Netanyahu-It-may-take-time-but-resolution-will-be-rescinded-476426 Netanyahu: It may take time, but resolution will be rescinded] ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', 25 December 2016.</ref> Israeli opposition leader [[Isaac Herzog]] responded that Netanyahu had 'declared war this evening on the world, on the United States, on Europe, and is trying to calm us with conceit',<ref>[[Peter Baker (author)|Peter Baker]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/world/middleeast/trump-may-complicate-israeli-diplomacy.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0 'U.S. Transition Puts Israeli Focus Back on Palestinians,'] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 24 December 2016.</ref> although Herzog also condemned the UN resolution.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Israels-political-ranks-unite-against-UN-resolution-476458|title=Israel's political ranks unite against UN resolution|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=25 December 2016|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>

During the meeting over the resolution, the Israeli ambassador [[Danny Danon]] denounced members who had approved it, comparing it to banning the French from "building in Paris".<ref name=nytimes /> [[David Keyes]], a spokesperson for Netanyahu, said President Barack Obama was behind the resolution and helped with both "formulating and pushing" it.<ref>{{cite news|title=Official: 'Rather ironclad' intel shows Obama behind UN vote|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/official-rather-ironclad-intel-shows-obama-behind-un-vote/|accessdate=27 December 2016|work=The Times of Israel}}</ref> However, [[Gerard van Bohemen]], New Zealand's ambassador to the United Nations disputed this notion by saying that "we did not discuss the substance of the resolution at any time with the United States", and further noting that none of the other Security Council members were aware that the United States was planning to abstain.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/us/politics/john-kerry-speech-israel-palestinians.html|title=John Kerry, in a Final, Pointed Plea, Will Outline a Vision of Mideast Peace|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Sanger, David E.|date=27 December 2016|accessdate=29 December 2016}}</ref>

The Israeli government also fears that the resolution's call to distinguish between the territories of Israel and the occupied territories will encourage the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement.<ref name=toi />

=== By Palestine ===

Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] said, "The voting in favour of the resolution has not resolved the Palestinian cause, but defined it." He added, "The world said its word that settlement in the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem, is illegal".<ref>{{cite web|title=Israeli settlements: UN resolution sets forth legal foundations for solution|url=http://www.aps.dz/en/world/15910-israeli-settlements-un-resolution-confirms-required-legal-basics/15910-israeli-settlements-un-resolution-confirms-required-legal-basics|website=APS|publisher=Algeria Press Service|accessdate=27 December 2016}}</ref>

He asked Israel "to sit together on the negotiation table to discuss all the outstanding issues between us and resolve it with good intentions", adding: "We are neighbors on this holy land and we want peace."

Including a reference to the [[Arab Peace Initiative]], he stated: "You (Israel) have your state, and we can have our state, and then we can live side-by-side in peace and security." He added, "If you accept, then there are 57 Arab and Islamic countries will be ready to recognize you."<ref>{{cite web|title=Abbas welcomes UN resolution, calls on Israel to talk peace|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/abbas-welcomes-un-resolution-calls-on-israel-to-talk-peace/|website=The Times of Israel|accessdate=27 December 2016}}</ref>

Chief Palestinian negotiator [[Saeb Erekat]] said: "this is a day of victory for international law, a victory for civilised language and negotiation and a total rejection of extremist forces in Israel. The international community has told the people of Israel that the way to security and peace is not going to be done through occupation, but rather through peace, ending the occupation and establishing a Palestinian state to live side by side with the state of Israel on the 1967 line."<ref name="aljazeera1"/>

=== By non-state parties ===
;International human rights organizations
[[Amnesty International]] said the "decision to finally pass a resolution condemning illegal Israeli settlements is a welcome step," that "the resolution includes a crucial demand that the Israeli authorities immediately halt all settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Such activities constitute a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law and, according to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, constitute a war crime. We also welcome the resolution’s recognition of the illegality of Israeli settlements" and that the "Security Council must now ensure this resolution is respected."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/12/un-security-council-resolution-on-israeli-settlements-in-opt/ |title=UN Security Council: Historic resolution calls on Israel to cease settlements &#124; Amnesty International |website=Amnesty.org |date=23 December 2016 |accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>

== Ramifications ==
=== For the settlements ===
According to the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'', there are no short-term practical ramifications for Israel with regards to the settlement activities. The [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] already makes it illegal for nations to move populations and establish settlements in territories acquired in a war, and an overwhelming number of countries already consider the Israeli settlements to be illegal on that basis.<ref name=haaretz_analysis /> In addition, the resolution does not include any sanctions or coercive measures against those who violated it.<ref name=haaretz_analysis /> However, in the medium or long term, the resolution might influence how the [[International Criminal Court]] in The Hague treats [[lawsuit]]s filed against Israel, and may create a justification for countries and individual organizations to impose sanctions on the settlements.<ref name=haaretz_analysis /> According to [[Ynet]], the resolution makes it possible to file [[lawsuit]]s against Israel and Israeli officials as well as Israeli citizens involved in settlement activity at the International Criminal Court and for sanctions to be imposed on Israel both by the UN and by individual countries.<ref>Itamar Eichner,,[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4897773,00.html 'Ramifications of UNSC resolution: Sanctions, boycotts and ICC lawsuits,'] [[Ynet]], 24 December 2016.</ref>

=== Diplomacy ===
The Israeli government was said to be mulling retaliation, by a number of diplomatic and financial moves, against a number of nations which had sponsored or supported the resolution. The proposed measures consist of cutting funding to five UN institutions; blocking work visas for employees of the said agencies; expelling [[Chris Gunness]], the spokesman for [[UNRWA]]; cancelling Israeli aid to Senegal directed at alleviating poverty; and cancelling a scheduled visit to Israel by Ukraine's Prime Minister [[Volodymyr Groysman]]. In addition, the Israeli Government also recalled their Ambassadors from Senegal and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eichner |first1=Itamar |last2=Tzimuki |first2=Tova |title=Israel retaliates for UNSC resolution with series of countermoves |url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4898065,00.html |accessdate=28 August 2018 |work=[[Ynetnews]] |date=21 December 2018}}</ref>
