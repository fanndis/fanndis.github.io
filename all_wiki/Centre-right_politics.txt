'''Centre-right politics''', or '''center-right politics''', lean to the [[Right-wing politics|right]] of the [[Left–right politics|political spectrum]], but are closer to the [[Centrism|centre]] than others. From the 1780s to the 1880s, there was a shift in the [[Western world]] of [[social class]] structure and the economy, moving away from the [[nobility]] and [[mercantilism]], as well as moving toward the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[capitalism]].<ref>{{citation | last = Kahan | first = Alan S.| contribution = The unexpected honeymoon of mind and money, 1730–1830 | editor-last = Kahan | editor-first = Alan S. | title = Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism | page = 88 | publisher = [[Transaction Publishers]] | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1412810630 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last1 = Shenon | first1 = Philip | last2 = Greenhouse | first2 = Linda | author-link2 = Linda Greenhouse | title = Washington talk: Briefing; the King and the Joker | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/17/us/washington-talk-briefing-the-king-and-the-joker.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 17 August 1988 | quote = This is the [[Title of Nobility Clause|''title of nobility'' clause]], which provides: 'No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States'.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last = Wood | first = Diane | author-link = Diane Wood | title = Our 18th century constitution in the 21st century world | journal = New York University Law Review, Madison Lecture | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 1079–1107 | publisher = [[New York University School of Law]] | date = October 2005 | url = http://www.nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-80-number-4/our-18th-century-constitution-21st-century-world | quote = Debate [over the Constitution's] meaning is inevitable whenever something as specific as the...

The [[International Democrat Union]] is an alliance of centre-right to right-wing political parties, including the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] of [[India]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party of the United Kingdom]], the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] of the [[United States]], the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], the [[New Zealand National Party]] and [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties, which declares commitment to human rights as well as economic development.<ref>[[International Democrat Union]].

Ideologies characterised as centre-right include [[liberal conservatism]] and some variants of [[Christian democracy]], among others. The economic aspects of the modern centre-right has been influenced by [[economic liberalism]], and generally supports [[free markets]], limited [[government spending]] and other policies heavily associated with [[neoliberalism]]. The moderate right is neither universally [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] nor [[cultural liberalism|culturally liberal]], and often combines both beliefs with support for [[civil liberties]] and elements of [[traditional conservatism|traditionalism]]. 

Historical examples of centre-right schools of thought include [[One Nation Conservatism]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Red Tories]] in [[Canada]], and [[Rockefeller Republicans]] in the [[United States]]. [[New Democrats]] also embraced several aspects of centre-right policy, including [[balanced budgets]], [[free trade]], and [[welfare reform]]. These ideological factions contrast with [[far right]] policies and [[right-wing populism]]. They also tend to be more supportive of [[cultural liberalism]] and [[green conservatism]] than right-wing variants. 

According to a 2019 study, centre-right parties had approximately 27% of the vote share in 21 Western democracies in 2018.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Gidron|first=Noam|last2=Ziblatt|first2=Daniel|date=2019-05-11|title=Center-Right Political Parties in Advanced Democracies|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=17–35|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-090717-092750|doi-access=free|issn=1094-2939}}</ref> This was a decline from 37% in 1960.<ref name=":0" />

==History==
===French Revolution to World War II===
The prominent inspiration for the centre-right (especially in Britain) was the [[traditionalist conservatism]] of [[Edmund Burke]].<ref>{{citation | last = Eatwell | first = Roger | author-link = Roger Eatwell | contribution = The nature of the Right: the right as a variety of styles of thought | editor-last1 = Eatwell | editor-first1 = Roger | editor-last2 = O'Sullivan | editor-first2 = Noël | editor-link = Roger Eatwell | title = The nature of the right: American and European politics and political thought since 1789 | page = 66 | publisher = Twayne Publishers | location = Boston | year = 1990 | series = Themes in right-wing ideology and politics series | isbn = 9780861879342 | quote = Burke has been seen as the father of modern British conservatism, which serves as the best example of the moderate right tradition. }}</ref> Burke's traditionalist conservatism was more moderate than the [[continental conservatism]] developed by [[Joseph De Maistre]] in [[France]], that upon experiencing the [[French Revolution]] completely denounced the status quo that existed immediately prior to the revolution (unlike Burke) and de Maistre sought a [[reactionary]] counter-revolution that would dismantle all modern society and return it to a strictly religious-based society.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Adams | first1 = Bert | last2 = Sydie | first2 = R.A. | contribution = Section I The origins of sociological theory: the philosophical precursors of sociology | editor-last1 = Adams | editor-first1 = Bert | editor-last2 = Sydie | editor-first2 = R.A. | title = Sociological theory | pages = 25–26 | publisher = Pine Forge Press | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780761985570 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> While Burke condemned the French Revolution, he had supported the [[American Revolution]] that he viewed as being a conservative revolution.<ref name="David">{{citation | last = Bridge | first = Carl | author-link = Carl Bridge | contribution = Burke and the conservative tradition | editor-last1 = Close | editor-first1 = David H. | editor-last2 = Bridge | editor-first2 = Carl | editor-link2 = Carl Bridge | title = Revolution: a history of the idea | page = 81 | publisher = [[Croom Helm Ltd.]] | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 9780709934202 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> Burke claimed that the Americans revolted for the same reason as the English had during the [[Glorious Revolution]], in both cases a monarch had overstepped the boundaries of his duties.<ref name="David" /> Burke claimed that the American Revolution was justified because King George III had overstepped his customary rights by imposing taxes on the American colonists without their consent.<ref name="David" /> Burke opposed the French Revolution because he opposed its anti-traditionalism and its use of abstract ideas, such as the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and its [[egalitarianism|universal egalitarianism]] that Burke rebuked by claiming that it effectively endorsed "hairdressers" being able to be politicians.<ref name="David" />

In Britain, the traditionalist conservative movement was represented in the British Conservative Party.<ref name="IanAdams" /> Conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]] sought to address social problems affecting the working class due to lack of assistance from the laissez-faire economy and formed his [[one nation conservatism]] that claimed that lack of assistance for the lower classes had divided British society into two nations – the rich and the poor as the result of unrestrained private enterprise, he claimed that he sought to break down.<ref name="IanAdams_a">{{cite book | last = Adams | first = Ian | title = Political ideology today | page = [https://archive.org/details/politicalideolog0000adam/page/59 59] | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2001 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780719060205 | url = https://archive.org/details/politicalideolog0000adam/page/59 }}</ref> Disraeli said that he supported a united British nation while presenting the other parties representing the upper-class or the lower-class.<ref name="IanAdams" /> Disraeli was hostile to [[free trade]] and preferred aristocratic [[paternalism]] as well as promoting [[imperialism]].<ref name="IanAdams" /> However, with the revival in Britain of the socialist movement with the rise of the Labour Party and the demise of the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party shifted to become a supporter of capitalism and an opponent of [[socialism]], while advocacy of capitalism was promoted within the principles of traditionalist conservatism.<ref name="IanAdams" />

Another centre-right movement that arose in France in response to the French Revolution was the beginning of the [[Christian democracy]] movement, where moderate conservative Catholics accepted the democratic elements of the French Revolution.<ref name="IanAdams_a" /> The first Christian democratic party was founded in Italy in 1919 by [[Luigi Sturzo]], but it was suppressed by the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] regime and was forced into exile in France.<ref name="IanAdams_a" /> In France, Sturzo founded an international movement that supported the creation of a European [[common market]] and European integration to prevent war, amongst those who attended the group included future German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Alcide de Gasperi]] and [[Robert Schuman]].<ref name="IanAdams_a" />

===Post–World War II===
In Europe after [[World War II]], centre-right Christian democratic parties arose as powerful political movements while the Catholic traditionalist movements in Europe diminished in strength.<ref name="IanAdams_a" /> Christian democratic movements became major movements in [[Austria]], the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Germany]] and [[Italy]].<ref name="IanAdams_a" />

[[Neoliberalism]] arose as an economic theory by [[Milton Friedman]] that condemned government [[Economic interventionism|interventionism in the economy]] that it associated with socialism and [[collectivism]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Adams | first = Ian | title = Political ideology today | page = [https://archive.org/details/politicalideolog0000adam/page/206 206] | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2001 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780719060205 | url = https://archive.org/details/politicalideolog0000adam/page/206 }}</ref> Neoliberals rejected [[Keynesian economics]] that they claimed advocate too much emphasis on relieving [[unemployment]] in response to their observance of the [[Great Depression]], identifying the real problem as being with [[inflation]] and advocate the policy of [[monetarism]] to deal with inflation.<ref>{{cite book | last = Adams | first = Ian | title = Political ideology today | page = [https://archive.org/details/politicalideolog0000adam/page/207 207] | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2001 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780719060205 | url = https://archive.org/details/politicalideolog0000adam/page/207 }}</ref>

Neoliberal economics was endorsed by Conservative British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] who adapted it as part of a [[Free market|free-market]] conservatism closer to the developments in [[American conservatism]], while traditionalist conservatism became less influential within the British Conservative Party.<ref>{{cite book | last = Adams | first = Ian | title = Political ideology today | page = [https://archive.org/details/politicalideolog0000adam/page/58 58] | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2001 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780719060205 | url = https://archive.org/details/politicalideolog0000adam/page/58 }}</ref> However, the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] still has a large traditional conservative base, particularly the conservative [[Cornerstone Group]]. Thatcher publicly supported centre-right politics and supported its spread in [[Eastern Europe]] after the end of the [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] regimes in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{citation | last = Evans | first = Eric J. | author-link = Eric J.

In the United States, President [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981–1989) adopted many policies stemming from [[Milton Friedman]]'s economic theories, including principles from the [[Chicago school of economics]] and [[monetarism]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cornwell | first = Rupert | author-link = Rupert Cornwell | title = Milton Friedman, free-market economist who inspired Reagan and Thatcher, dies aged 94 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/milton-friedman-freemarket-economist-who-inspired-reagan-and-thatcher-dies-aged-94-424665.html | work = [[The Independent]] | publisher = Independent Print Ltd | location = Washington | date = 17 November 2006 }}</ref> While social conservatives and the rise of the [[Christian Right]] contributed greatly to forming the [[Reagan Coalition]], the President also had the support of right-wing economic neoliberals. Using Friedman's neoliberal theories, the Reagan administration cut the marginal income tax from 70% to 28% and reduced civilian unemployment from 10.8% to 5.3% of the workforce.<ref>{{cite web | title = The second American revolution: Reagonomics | url = http://www.reaganfoundation.org/economic-policy.aspx | website = reaganfoundation.org | publisher = [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]] }}</ref>
