==Politics==

===Member of Parliament===
A member of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], he was first elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] in 1935 and entered the [[Cabinet of Canada|cabinet]] in 1945.  He went on to serve as a noted member of the cabinets of four Prime Ministers: [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], [[Louis St. Laurent]], [[Lester B. Pearson]] and [[Pierre Trudeau]].

Martin was viewed as one of the most left-wing members of the Liberal cabinet, and as [[Minister of National Health and Welfare (Canada)|Minister of National Health and Welfare]] from 1946 to 1957 he played an important role in the fight against [[polio]] and overseeing the creation of hospital insurance in Canada, and is sometimes recognized as a [[father of medicare]]. Martin served as [[Secretary of State for External Affairs (Canada)|Secretary of State for External Affairs]] in the Pearson government, and was instrumental in the acquisition of U.S. nuclear weapons for Canadian Forces.<ref>Clearwater, J.

===Liberal leadership bids===
He ran for the Liberal leadership three times, in [[1948 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election|1948]], in [[1958 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election|1958]] and [[1968 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election|1968]], but was defeated at all three [[Liberal leadership conventions]], first by Louis St. Laurent, then by Lester B. Pearson, then by Pierre Trudeau.

===Senator and beyond===
Trudeau appointed him to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] in 1968.  He served as [[Leader of the Government in the Senate (Canada)|Leader of the Government in the Senate]] until 1974 when he was appointed [[High Commissioner]] to the [[United Kingdom]]. He also served as Chancellor of [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] from 1972–1977, as a result of which the university named the Paul Martin Centre in his honour. Until his death Paul Martin was an Adjunct Professor of Political Science at the [[University of Windsor]].

His two volume memoirs, ''A Very Public Life'', was published in 1983 ({{ISBN|0888790929}}) and 1986 ({{oclc|165756245}} {{Google books|d37DmgEACAAJ|A very public life: So many worlds Volume 2 of A very public life}}).

==Honours==
In 1976 he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]]. In recognition of his accomplishments, Martin was granted the right to use the [[honorific]] [[Right Honourable]] in 1992, a rare honour for one who has never been Prime Minister, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor-General]] or [[Chief Justice of Canada]].

The [[University of Windsor]] has a Paul Martin Chair in law and political science, recently held by former Manitoba Premier [[Howard Pawley]] (until his retirement from the university), and the Paul Martin Law Library. The City of Windsor had also renamed their "Post Office Building" the [[Paul Martin Sr. Building]] in his honour on November 18, 1994.
