'''Yahoo! Search''' is a rebadged version of the [[Bing (search engine)|Bing search engine]] owned by [[Yahoo!]], headquartered in [[Sunnyvale, California]].<ref name="tc-changes">{{Cite web |title=Ad Tech And Mobile In Focus In Microsoft And Yahoo's Renewed Search Deal |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/16/microsoft-and-yahoo-renew-search-allian/ |access-date=June 30, 2015 |website=TechCrunch}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=EL |title=Yahoo search |url=https://search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?p=yahoo+headquarters&ei=UTF-8&hspart=mozilla&hsimp=yhs-002 |access-date=August 12, 2017}}</ref>

Originally, "Yahoo Search" referred to a Yahoo-provided interface that sent [[Web search query|queries]] to a searchable index of pages supplemented with its directory of [[website]]s. The results were presented to the user under the Yahoo! brand. Originally, none of the actual [[Web crawler|web crawling]] and [[Data warehouse|data housing]] was done by Yahoo! itself. In 2001, the searchable index was powered by [[Inktomi (company)|Inktomi]] and later by [[Google]] until 2004, when Yahoo! Search became independent. On July 29, 2009, [[Microsoft]] and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would henceforth power Yahoo! Search.<ref name="Microsoft and Yahoo seal web deal" />

As of July 2018, Microsoft Sites handled 24.2 percent of all search queries in the United States. During the same period of time, [[Verizon Media|Oath]] (the then-owner of the Yahoo brand) had a search [[market share]] of 11.5 percent. Market leader Google generated 63.2 percent of all core search queries in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Search engine market share in the United States 2018 - Statistic |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/267161/market-share-of-search-engines-in-the-united-states/ |website=Statista}}</ref>

Yahoo! Search has been criticized for favoring websites owned by Yahoo!'s parent company, [[Verizon Media]], in its search results.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 6, 2020 |title=Yahoo!, AOL, OneSearch results biased in favor of parent company Verizon Media’s websites |url=https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/verizon-media-search.html |website=Ctrl blog}}</ref>

== Search technology acquisition ==
The roots of Search date back to [[Yahoo! Directory]], which was launched in 1994 by [[Jerry Yang]] and [[David Filo]], then students at [[Stanford University]]. In 1995, they introduced a [[search engine]] function, called Yahoo! Search, that allowed users to search Yahoo! Directory.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Oppitz |first=Marcus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrEvDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA238 |title=Inventing the Cloud Century: How Cloudiness Keeps Changing Our Life, Economy and Technology |last2=Tomsu |first2=Peter |date=2017 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319611617 |page=238}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=28 November 1996 |title=Yahoo!

They later licensed [[Web search engines]] from other companies. Seeking to provide its own Web search engine results, Yahoo! acquired their own Web search technology. In 2002, they bought [[Inktomi (company)|Inktomi]], a "behind the scenes" or OEM search engine provider, whose results are shown on other companies' websites and powered Yahoo! in its earlier days.

In 2003, they purchased [[Yahoo Search Marketing|Overture Services, Inc.]], which included their owned the [[AlltheWeb]] and [[AltaVista]] search engines. Initially, even though Yahoo! owned multiple search engines, they didn't use them on the main yahoo.com website, but kept using [[Google Search|Google's search engine]] for its results.

[[File:Ysearch 2005.png|thumb|Yahoo! Search page in 2005]]
Starting on April 7, 2003, Yahoo! Search became its own [[web crawler]]-based search engine.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 13, 2008 |title=Yahoo! Inc. - Company Timeline |url=http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/timeline.cfm |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713214826/http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/timeline.cfm |archive-date=July 13, 2008 |access-date=July 19, 2016 |website=[[Wayback Machine]]}}</ref> They combined the capabilities of search engine companies they had acquired and their prior research into a reinvented crawler called ''Yahoo!''. The new search engine results were included in all of Yahoo's websites that had a web search function. Yahoo! also started to sell the search engine results to other companies, to show on their own websites. Their relationship with Google was terminated at that time, with the former partners becoming each other's main competitors.

In October 2007, Yahoo! Search was updated with a more modern appearance in line with the redesigned Yahoo! home page. In addition, ''Search Assist'' was added; which provides real-time query suggestions and related concepts as they are typed.

[[File:Ysearch 2008.png|thumb|Yahoo! Search page in 2008]]
In July 2008, Yahoo! Search announced the introduction of a new service called  [[Yahoo! Search BOSS]] ("Build your Own Search Engine"). This service opens the doors for developers to use Yahoo!'s system for indexing information and images and create their own custom search engine.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 10, 2008 |title=Yahoo Opens Up Search Technology Infrastructure for Innovative, New Search Experiences, Providing Third Parties with Unprecedented Access, Re-Ranking and Presentation Control of Web Search Results |url=http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=320623 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220214442/http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=320623 |archive-date=December 20, 2010 |access-date=July 25, 2008 |publisher=Yahoo}}</ref>

In January 2010, Microsoft announced a deal in which it would take over the functional operation of Yahoo! Search, and set up a joint venture to sell advertising on both Yahoo! Search and [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] known as the Microsoft Search Alliance. A complete transition of all Yahoo! sponsored ad clients to Microsoft adCenter (now [[Bing Ads]]) occurred in October 2010.<ref name="Microsoft and Yahoo seal web deal" />

[[File:Ysearch 2011.png|thumb|Yahoo! Search page in 2011]]
On March 12, 2014, Yahoo announced a partnership with [[Yelp]] to integrate its reviews and user-contributed photos into Yahoo! Search (as Bing had previously done).<ref name="tc-yelppartnership">{{Cite web |title=Yahoo Partners With Yelp To Bring Local Data To Its Search Tools |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/12/yahoo-partners-with-yelp-to-bring-local-data-to-its-search-tools/ |access-date=February 21, 2017 |website=TechCrunch}}</ref>

In November 2014, Mozilla signed a five-year partnership with Yahoo, making Yahoo Search the default search engine for [[Firefox]] browsers in the US.<ref name="blog.mozilla">{{Cite web |title=New Search Strategy for Firefox: Promoting Choice & Innovation |url=https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/11/19/promoting-choice-and-innovation-on-the-web/ |website=The Mozilla Blog}}</ref>

In April 2015, the Microsoft partnership was modified, now only requiring Bing results on the "majority" of desktop traffic, opening the ability for Yahoo to enter into non-exclusive deals for search services on mobile platforms and the remainder of desktop traffic. The amendment also gives either company the ability to terminate the contract with four months' notice.  In October 2015, Yahoo subsequently reached an agreement with [[Google]] to provide services to Yahoo Search through the end of 2018, including advertising, search, and image search services.<ref name="verge-googleyahoo">{{Cite web |date=October 20, 2015 |title=Yahoo enters deal to display Google search results |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/20/9577519/yahoo-google-search-deal |access-date=October 21, 2015 |website=The Verge}}</ref><ref name="ars-april2015deal">{{Cite web |date=April 16, 2015 |title=Microsoft loses exclusivity in shaken up Yahoo search deal |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/04/microsoft-loses-exclusivity-in-shaken-up-yahoo-search-deal/ |access-date=June 30, 2015 |website=Ars Technica}}</ref><ref name=tc-changes/> As of October 2019, Yahoo! Search is once again “powered by Bing”.

== Search results ==
Yahoo Search indexed and cached the common HTML page formats, as well as several of the more popular file-types, such as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Excel spreadsheet]]s, [[PowerPoint]], [[Word document]]s, RSS/XML and plain text files. For some of these supported file-types, Yahoo Search provided cached links on their search results allowing for viewing of these file-types in standard HTML. Using the Advanced Search interface or Preferences settings, Yahoo Search allowed the customization of search results and enabling of certain settings such as: SafeSearch, Language Selection, Number of results, Domain restrictions, etc.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yahoo Advanced Web Search |url=http://search.yahoo.com/web/advanced?ei=UTF-8}}</ref> For a Basic and starter guide to Yahoo Search, they also provided a ''Search Basics'' tutorial.<ref>[http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/search/basics/ Search Basics tutorial] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002171751/http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/search/basics/ |date=October 2, 2007 }}</ref> In 2005, Yahoo began to provide links to previous versions of pages archived on the [[Wayback Machine]].<ref>[http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/050918-143500 Yahoo Cache Now Offers Direct Links to Wayback Machine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501121717/http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/050918-143500 |date=May 1, 2011 }} Search Engine Watch, September 18, 2005</ref> In the first week of May 2008, Yahoo launched a new search mash up called ''Yahoo Glue'', which is in beta testing.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hopkins |first=Mark |date=November 13, 2008 |title=Yahoo!

== Selection-based search ==
On June 20, 2007, Yahoo introduced a [[selection-based search]] feature called Yahoo Shortcuts. When activated this selection-based search feature enabled users to invoke search using only their mouse and receive search suggestions in floating windows while remaining on Yahoo properties such as Yahoo Mail.  This feature was only active on Yahoo web pages or pages within the [[Yahoo Publisher Network]].  Yahoo Shortcuts required the content-owner to modify the underlying HTML of his or her webpage to call out the specific keywords to be enhanced.  The technology for context-aware selection-based search on Yahoo pages was first developed by Reiner Kraft.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yahoo shortcuts |url=http://www.digital-fraction.com/yahoo-shortcuts/}}</ref>

== SearchScan ==
