'''Lucille Désirée Ball''' (August 6, 1911 – April 26, 1989) was an American actress, comedian, model, studio executive and producer. As one of Hollywood’s greatest icons, she was the star and producer of sitcoms ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', and ''[[Life with Lucy]]'', as well as comedy television specials aired under the title ''[[The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour|The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]''.

Ball's career began in 1929 when she landed work as a model. Shortly thereafter, she began her performing career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] using the [[stage name]] Diane (or Dianne) Belmont. She later appeared in several minor film roles in the 1930s and 1940s as a contract player for [[RKO Radio Pictures]], being cast as a chorus girl or in similar roles. During this time, she met Cuban bandleader [[Desi Arnaz]], and the two [[Elopement (marriage)|eloped]] in November 1940. In the 1950s, Ball ventured into television. In 1951, she and Arnaz created the sitcom ''I Love Lucy'', a series that became one of the most beloved programs in television history. The same year, Ball gave birth to their first child, [[Lucie Arnaz]],<ref name="Lucie" /> followed by [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] in 1953.<ref name="twoop-bio" /> Ball and Arnaz divorced in May 1960, and she married comedian [[Gary Morton]] in 1961.{{sfn|Sanders|Gilbert|1993|p=216}}

Following the end of ''I Love Lucy'', Ball produced<ref>{{Cite book|last=Suskin|first=Steven|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HsETDAAAQBAJ&q=wildcat+1960+broadway+producers&pg=PA303|title=Show Tunes: The Songs, Shows, and Careers of Broadway's Major Composers|date=2010-03-09|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=|isbn=978-0-19-531407-6|location=|pages=|language=en|author-link=Steven Suskin}}</ref> and starred in the Broadway musical ''[[Wildcat (musical)|Wildcat]]'' from 1960 to 1961. The show received lukewarm reviews and had to be closed when Ball became ill for several weeks. After ''Wildcat'', Ball reunited with ''I Love Lucy'' co-star [[Vivian Vance]] for ''The'' ''Lucy Show'', which Vance left in 1965. The show continued, with Ball's longtime friend and series regular [[Gale Gordon]], until 1968. Ball immediately began appearing in a new series, ''Here's Lucy'', with Gordon, frequent show guest [[Mary Jane Croft]], and Lucie and Desi Jr.; this program ran until 1974.

In 1962, Ball became the first woman to run a major television studio, [[Desilu Productions]], which produced many popular television series, including ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''.<ref>"Arnaz Quits Presidency Of Desilu; Former Wife, Lucille Ball, Gets Post", ''Wall Street Journal'', November 9, 1962, p. 18.</ref> Ball did not retire from acting completely, and in 1985, she took on a dramatic role in the television film ''[[Stone Pillow]]''. The next year she starred in ''Life with Lucy'', which was, unlike her other sitcoms, not well-received; the show was cancelled after three months. She appeared in film and television roles for the rest of her career until her death in April 1989 from an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]] at the age of 77.<ref name="Morbid">{{cite web|url=http://www.morbid-curiosity.com/id125.htm|title=Lucille Ball|accessdate=April 6, 2008|publisher=Morbid Curiosity|quote=Lucille Ball is recovering and dies}}</ref>

==Early life==
Born at 69 Stewart Avenue, [[Jamestown, New York]],<ref>https://www.fentonhistorycenter.org/special-features/lucille-ball/the-many-names-of-lucy-and-family/</ref> Lucille Désirée Ball was the daughter of Henry Durrell Ball (1887–1915), a [[Lineman (technician)|lineman]] for [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]], and Désirée "DeDe" Evelyn Ball (née Hunt; 1892–1977). Her family belonged to the [[Baptist]] church. Her ancestors were mostly [[English people|English]], but a few were [[Scottish-Americans|Scottish]], [[French American|French]], and [[Irish Americans|Irish]].{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=10}}{{sfn|Ball|1997|pp=168–69}} Some were among the earliest settlers in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], including Elder John Crandall of [[Westerly, Rhode Island]], and [[Edmund Rice (1638)|Edmund Rice]], an early emigrant from England to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Some Ancestral Remains of Lucille Ball|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nychauta/CEMETERY/ForestHill/LucilleBall.html|accessdate=October 6, 2012|publisher=Rootsweb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Isaac Ball (1747-?)|url=http://www.edmund-rice.org/era5gens/p3.htm#i334023|accessdate=May 13, 2012|publisher=Edmund Rice (1638) Association.

As part of her father's work for Bell Telephone, he was frequently transferred and the family moved often during her childhood. The family had moved from Jamestown to [[Anaconda, Montana]], and later to [[Trenton, New Jersey]].<ref name=":1" /> In February 1915, while living in [[Wyandotte, Michigan]], her father died from typhoid fever at 27 years old, when Ball was three.<ref>Patch, Jason Alley, [http://patch.com/michigan/wyandotte/lucille-ball-lived-in-wyandotte-as-a-young-child], patch.com, August 7, 2011.</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=1952-05-26|title=Radio: Sassafrassa, the Queen|language=en-US|work=Time|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,859647-6,00.html|access-date=2020-06-22|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> At the time of Henry's death, DeDe Ball was pregnant with her second child, [[Fred Ball|Fred Henry Ball]] (1915–2007). Ball recalled little from the day her father died, except a bird getting trapped in the house which caused her lifelong [[ornithophobia]].<ref name=":2" />

Ball's mother returned to New York, where maternal grandparents helped raise her and brother Fred in [[Celoron, New York|Celoron]], a summer resort village on [[Lake Chautauqua]], {{convert|2.5|mi|0}} west of downtown Jamestown.<ref name=":1">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Lucille Ball Biography|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Ba-Be/Ball-Lucille.html|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}</ref> Ball loved Celoron Park, a popular amusement area in the United States at that time. Its boardwalk had a ramp to the lake that served as a children's slide, the Pier Ballroom, a roller-coaster, a bandstand, and a stage where vaudeville concerts and regular theatrical shows were presented.<ref name="Higham 1986">Higham, C. (1986). ''Lucy: The Life of Lucille Ball'', New York: St. Martin's Press.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

Four years after Henry Ball's death, DeDe Ball married Edward Peterson. While her mother and stepfather looked for work in another city, Peterson's parents cared for her and her brother. Ball's step-grandparents were a puritanical [[Sweden|Swedish]] couple who banished all mirrors from the house except one over the bathroom sink. When the young Ball was caught admiring herself in it, she was severely chastised for being vain. This period of time affected Ball so deeply that, in later life, she said that it lasted seven or eight years.{{sfn|Harris|1991|pp=23–24}}

When Ball was twelve, her stepfather encouraged her to audition for his [[Shriners|Shriner]]'s organization that was in need of entertainers for the [[chorus line]] of their next show.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=16}} While Ball was onstage, she realized performing was a great way to gain praise and her appetite for recognition was awakened.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=20}} During this time in 1927, her family was forced to relocate into a small apartment in Jamestown after they suffered a misfortune when their house and furnishings were sold to settle a financial [[legal judgment]]. A neighborhood boy was accidentally shot and paralyzed by someone [[target shooting]] in their yard under the supervision of Ball's grandfather.{{sfn|Ball|1996|p=41}}

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1925, Ball, then only 14, started dating Johnny DeVita, a 21-year-old local hoodlum. Her mother was unhappy with the relationship, and hoped the romance she was unable to influence would burn out. After about a year, her mother tried to separate them by exploiting Ball's desire to be in show business. Despite the family's meager finances, in 1926 she enrolled Ball in the [[John Murray Anderson]] School for the Dramatic Arts,<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Swift |first=Sunday|date=February 2019|title=Lucille Ball|magazine=[[Chap (magazine)|Chap]] |pages=29–33}}</ref> in New York City,{{sfn|Brady|2001|p=20}}{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=24}} where [[Bette Davis]] was a fellow student. Ball later said about that time in her life, "All I learned in drama school was how to be frightened."{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=205}} Ball's instructors felt she would not be successful in the entertainment business, and were unafraid to directly state this to her.

In the face of this harsh criticism, Ball was determined to prove her teachers wrong and returned to New York City in 1928. That same year, she began working for [[Hattie Carnegie]] as an in-house model. Carnegie ordered Ball to dye her then-brown hair blonde, and she complied. Of this time in her life, Ball said, "Hattie taught me how to slouch properly in a $1,000 hand-sewn sequin dress and how to wear a $40,000 sable coat as casually as rabbit."{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=30}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j66uvWzubRwC|title=Ball of Fire: The Tumultuous Life and Comic Art of Lucille Ball |last=Kanfer |first=Stefan |date=December 18, 2007|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |isbn=9780307424914}}</ref>

Her acting forays were still at an early stage when she became ill with [[rheumatic fever]] and was unable to work for two years.<ref name="NetGlimse"/>

In 1932, she moved back to New York City to resume her pursuit of an acting career, where she supported herself by again working for Carnegie{{sfn|Brady|2001|p=33}} and as the [[Chesterfield (cigarette)|Chesterfield]] [[cigarette girl (person)|cigarette girl]]. Using the name Diane (sometimes spelled Dianne) Belmont, she started getting chorus work on Broadway,{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=28}} but it was not lasting. Ball was hired&nbsp;– but then quickly fired&nbsp;– by theatre [[impresario]] [[Earl Carroll]] from his ''Vanities'', and by [[Florenz Ziegfeld]], from a touring company of ''[[Rio Rita (musical)|Rio Rita]]''.<ref name=":2">{{cite book|author1=Darryl J.

===Hollywood===

After an uncredited stint as a [[Goldwyn Girls|Goldwyn Girl]] in ''[[Roman Scandals]]'' (1933), starring [[Eddie Cantor]] and [[Gloria Stuart]], Ball moved permanently to Hollywood to appear in films. She had many small movie roles in the 1930s as a contract player for [[RKO Radio Pictures]], including a two-reel comedy short with the [[Three Stooges]] (''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', 1934) and a movie with the [[Marx Brothers]] (''[[Room Service (1938 film)|Room Service]]'', 1938). She also appeared in several [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] RKO musicals: as one of the featured models in ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935); as the flower girl in ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935); and in a brief [[supporting role]] at the beginning of ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936).<ref>{{cite web|title=Lucille Ball |url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=103863|publisher=Everything2.com|accessdate=April 5, 2008 |quote=Ball and Rogers are lifelong friends}}</ref> Ball and Ginger Rogers, who were distant maternal cousins, played aspiring actresses in the film ''[[Stage Door]]'' (1937) alongside Katharine Hepburn.<ref name=":0"/>

In 1936, she landed the role she hoped would lead her to Broadway, in the [[Bartlett Cormack]] play ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]'', a comedy set in a [[Duplex (building)|duplex]] apartment in Hollywood. The play premiered in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], on January 21, 1937, with Ball playing the part of Julie Tucker, "one of three roommates coping with neurotic directors, confused executives, and grasping stars, who interfere with the girls' ability to get ahead".{{sfn|Brady|2001|p=73}} The play received good reviews, but problems existed with star [[Conway Tearle]], who was in poor health. Cormack wanted to replace him, but producer [[Anne Nichols]] said the fault lay with the character and insisted the part needed to be rewritten. Unable to agree on a solution, the play closed after one week in [[Washington, DC]], when Tearle became gravely ill.{{sfn|Brady|2001|pp=73–74}}

Ball later auditioned for the role of [[Scarlett O'Hara]] for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), but [[Vivien Leigh]] got the part, winning an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her role. In 1940, Lucy appeared as the lead in the musical ''[[Too Many Girls (film)|Too Many Girls]]'' when she met and fell in love with Desi Arnaz, who played one of her character's four bodyguards in the movie.

Ball signed with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in the 1940s, but never achieved major stardom there.<ref name="isbn1550225901">{{cite book|author=Crouse, Richard J.|title=The 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen|publisher=ECW Press |location=Toronto|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/100bestmoviesyou0000crou/page/196 196]|isbn=1-55022-590-1|quote="Stage Door" gives Ball her big break|url=https://archive.org/details/100bestmoviesyou0000crou/page/196}}</ref> She was known in Hollywood circles as "Queen of the B's"<ref>https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/lucille-ball/</ref> – a title previously held by [[Fay Wray]] and later more closely associated with [[Ida Lupino]] and [[Marie Windsor]] – starring in a number of [[B movies (Hollywood Golden Age)|B-movies]], such as ''[[Five Came Back]]'' (1939).

Like many budding actresses, Ball picked up radio work to supplement her income and gain exposure. In 1937, she appeared regularly on ''The [[Phil Baker (comedian)|Phil Baker]] Show''. When its run ended in 1938, Ball joined the cast of ''The Wonder Show'' starring [[Jack Haley]]. There began her 50-year professional relationship with the show's announcer, [[Gale Gordon]]. ''The Wonder Show'' lasted one season, with the final episode airing on April 7, 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lucyfan.com/wondershow.html|title="The Wonder Show"&nbsp;– 1938 Radio Series&nbsp;– Starring Jack Haley, with Lucille Ball & Gale Gordon|accessdate=April 9, 2008|publisher=The Wonder Show|quote=Lucy and The Wonder Show}}</ref>

MGM producer [[Arthur Freed]] purchased the Broadway hit musical play ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady (film)|DuBarry Was a Lady]]'' (1943) especially for [[Ann Sothern]], but when she turned down the part, that role went to Ball, Sothern's real-life best friend. In 1943, Ball portrayed herself in ''[[Best Foot Forward (1943 film)|Best Foot Forward]]''. In 1946, Ball starred in ''[[Lover Come Back (1946 film)|Lover Come Back]]''. In 1947, she appeared in the murder mystery ''[[Lured]]'' as Sandra Carpenter, a [[taxi dancer]] in London.<ref name=":0"/>

[[File:I Love Lucy Cast.JPG|thumb|right|Cast of ''I Love Lucy'' with [[William Frawley]], [[Desi Arnaz]] and [[Vivian Vance]].]]
In 1948, Ball was cast as Liz Cooper (at first "Cugat"; this was changed because listeners were getting the characters confused with a real-life bandleader, [[Xavier Cugat]], who sued),<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nachman|first=Gerald|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkCiJ4KvzPYC&pg=PT125|title=Raised on Radio|date=2012-10-17|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-82894-1|language=en}}</ref> a wacky wife, in ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'', a radio comedy for [[CBS Radio]].<ref name=":0"/>

The show was successful, and CBS asked her to develop it for television. She agreed but insisted on working with her real-life husband, Cuban bandleader [[Desi Arnaz]]. CBS executives were reluctant, thinking the public would not accept an All-American redhead and a Cuban as a couple. CBS was initially unimpressed with the pilot episode, produced by the couple's [[Desilu Productions]] company. The pair went on the road with a [[vaudeville]] act, in which Lucy played the zany housewife, wanting to get into Arnaz's show. Given the great success of the tour, CBS put ''I Love Lucy'' into their lineup.<ref name="title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do">{{cite news|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sotomayer-more-splainin-t_b_236347|title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do|accessdate=June 18, 2010|work=The Huffington Post|quote=CBS executives originally did not want Ball, a sassy redhead, married to a Latino on the program|first=Allison|last=Silver|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref>

''I Love Lucy'' was not only a star vehicle for Lucille Ball, but also a potential means for her to salvage her marriage to Arnaz. Their relationship had become badly strained, in part because of their hectic performing schedules, which often kept them apart, but mostly due to Desi's attraction to other women.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Truth Behind Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's Turbulent Love Story|url=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a41926/lucy-and-desi-love-story/|last=Carter|first=Maria|date=2017-03-01|website=Country Living|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-20}}</ref>

Along the way, Ball created a television dynasty and achieved several firsts. She was the first woman to head a TV production company: Desilu, which she had formed with Arnaz. After their divorce in 1960, she bought out his share and became a very actively engaged studio head.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/previews/american_masters_lucy|title=American Masters "Lucille Ball: Finding Lucy"|accessdate=April 2, 2008|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|quote=Ball first woman to head a major studio}}</ref> Desilu and ''I Love Lucy'' pioneered a number of methods still in use in TV production today, such as filming before a [[live studio audience]] with a number of cameras, and distinct [[Stage set|sets]], adjacent to each other.<ref name=":0"/> During this time, Ball taught a 32-week [[comedy workshop]] at the [[Brandeis-Bardin Institute]]. She was quoted as saying, "You cannot teach someone comedy; either they have it or they don't."{{sfn|Karol|2004|p=201}}

During the run of ''I Love Lucy'', Ball and Arnaz wanted to remain in their Los Angeles home, but [[Time zones in the U.S.|time-zone]] logistics made that difficult. Since prime time in L.A. was too late to air a major network series live on the east coast, filming in California would have meant giving most of the TV audience an inferior [[kinescope]] picture – and, at least, a day later.<ref name="titleI Love Lucy Turns 50 - Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, background info on influential, groundbreaking TV comedy|USA Today (Society for the Advancement of Education)|Find Articles at BNET.com">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1272/is_2676_130/ai_78256901|title="I Love Lucy" Turns 50&nbsp;– Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, background info on influential, groundbreaking TV comedy|publisher=USA Today (Society for the Advancement of Education)|accessdate=April 5, 2008|quote=Arnaz did not want kinescope|first=Wes|last=Gehring|year=2001|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626011156/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1272/is_2676_130/ai_78256901|archive-date=June 26, 2008}}</ref>

Sponsor [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] pressured the couple into relocating, not wanting day-old kinescopes airing in major East Coast markets, nor did they want to pay the extra cost that filming, processing, and editing would require. Instead the couple offered to take a pay cut to finance filming, which Arnaz did on better quality [[35 mm movie film|35 mm]] film and on the condition that Desilu would retain the rights of each episode once it aired. CBS agreed to relinquish the post-first-broadcast rights to Desilu, not realizing they were giving up a valuable and enduring asset. In 1957, CBS bought back the rights for $1,000,000 (${{Format price|{{inflation|US|1000000|1957}}}} in today's terms), providing Ball and Arnaz's down payment for the purchase of the former [[RKO Pictures]] studios, which they turned into Desilu Studios.<ref>Cushman, Marc; ''These Are the Voyages, Vol. 1''; Jacobs/Brown Press; San Diego, CA, USA; 2013; p. 27</ref>

''I Love Lucy'' dominated U.S. ratings for most of its run.

===Activities 1960–1979===
The 1960 Broadway musical ''Wildcat'' ended its run early when producer and star Ball couldn't recover from a virus and continue the show after several weeks of returned ticket sales.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|p=220}} The show was the source of the song she made famous, "Hey, Look Me Over", which she performed with [[Paula Stewart]] on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Ball hosted a CBS Radio talk show entitled ''Let's Talk to Lucy'' in 1964–65. She also made a few more movies including ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine, and Ours]]'' (1968), and the musical ''[[Mame (film)|Mame]]'' (1974), and two more successful long-running sitcoms for CBS: ''[[The Lucy Show]]'' (1962–68), which costarred Vivian Vance and Gale Gordon, and ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' (1968–74), which also featured Gordon, as well as Lucy's real-life children, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr. She appeared on the [[Dick Cavett]] show in 1974 and spoke of her history and life with Arnaz.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
 
Ball's close friends in the business included perennial co-star [[Vivian Vance]] and film stars [[Judy Garland]], [[Ann Sothern]], and [[Ginger Rogers]], and comedic television performers [[Jack Benny]], [[Barbara Pepper]], [[Mary Wickes]] and [[Mary Jane Croft]]; all except Garland appeared at least once on her various series. Former Broadway co-stars [[Keith Andes]] and [[Paula Stewart]] also appeared at least once on her later sitcoms, as did [[Joan Blondell]], [[Rich Little]] and [[Ann-Margret]]. Ball mentored actress and singer [[Carole Cook]], and befriended [[Barbara Eden]], when Eden appeared on an episode of ''I Love Lucy''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1959, Ball became a friend and mentor to [[Carol Burnett]]. She guested on Burnett's highly successful CBS-TV special ''[[Carol + 2]]'' and the younger performer reciprocated by appearing on ''The Lucy Show''. It was rumored that Ball offered Burnett a chance to star on her own sitcom, but in truth Burnett was offered (and declined) "Here's Agnes" by CBS executives. She instead chose to create [[The Carol Burnett Show|her own variety show]] due to a stipulation that was on an existing contract she had with CBS.<ref name="Button">{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-carol-burnett-show-almost-never-happened/ |title=How "Carol Burnett Show" almost never happened |work=[[CBS News]] |date=September 25, 2012 |accessdate=August 30, 2018}}</ref> The two women remained close friends until Ball's death in 1989.

Ball was originally considered by [[Frank Sinatra]] for the role of Mrs. Iselin in the Cold War thriller ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]''. Director/producer [[John Frankenheimer]], however, had worked with [[Angela Lansbury]] in a mother role in ''[[All Fall Down (1962 film)|All Fall Down]]'' and insisted on having her for the part.<ref>Frankenheimer's DVD audio commentary.</ref>

Ball was the lead actress in a number of comedy television specials to about 1980, including ''Lucy Calls the President'' which featured Vivian Vance, Gale Gordon and Mary Jane Croft, and ''Lucy Moves to NBC'', a special depicting a fictionalization of her move to the [[NBC]] television network.

Aside from her acting career, she became an assistant professor at [[California State University, Northridge]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stern|first=Michael|date=2016|title=I Had a Ball: My Friendship with Lucille Ball Revised Edition|publisher=iUniverse|chapter=20|isbn=978-1532011412}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Holguin|first=Richard|date=1979-12-16|title='Everybody is a Comedian' Lucille Ball Starring in Northridge Classroom|url=http://www.lucyfan.com/lucyatnorthridge.html|work=Los Angeles Times|page=5|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>

===1980s===
During the mid-1980s, Ball attempted to resurrect her television career. In 1982, she hosted a two-part ''[[Three's Company]]'' [[retrospective]], showing [[film clips|clips]] from the show's first five seasons, summarizing memorable plotlines, and commenting on her love of the show.<ref name="titleTV Land March 2007 –To Be Continued Free Fridays; Threes Company 30th Anniversary – Sitcoms Online Message Boards">{{cite web|url=https://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=192779|title=TV Land March 2007 – To Be Continued Free Fridays; Three's Company 30th Anniversary&nbsp;– Sitcoms Online Message Boards|accessdate=April 6, 2008|publisher=TV Land|quote=Ball hosts Three's Company reflective}}</ref>

A 1985 dramatic made-for-TV film about an elderly homeless woman, ''[[Stone Pillow]]'', received mixed reviews. Her 1986 sitcom comeback ''[[Life with Lucy]]'', costarring her longtime [[Foil (literature)|foil]] Gale Gordon and co-produced by Ball, Gary Morton, and prolific producer [[Aaron Spelling]] was cancelled less than two months into its run by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref name="titleLife With Lucy">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvparty.com/movlucy4.html|title=Life With Lucy|accessdate=April 6, 2008 |publisher=TV Party|quote="Life With Lucy" turns out to be a flop}}</ref> In February 1988, Ball was named the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog/V_Y58RYZJ8ISFLYLS |work=Ten O'Clock News, WGBH|title=Lucille Ball at Hasty Pudding|date=February 19, 1988}}</ref>

==Testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities==
When Ball registered to vote in 1936, she listed her party affiliation as Communist, along with her brother and mother.<ref>{{cite web|year=1936|title=Index to Register of Voters|url=http://blogs.ancestry.com/ancestry/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/bal-lucy-actress-cst-1936-la-co-highlight.jpg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707140727/http://blogs.ancestry.com/ancestry/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/bal-lucy-actress-cst-1936-la-co-highlight.jpg|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 7, 2011|work=Ancestry.com|accessdate=March 14, 2012}} Copy of document from Los Angeles City Precinct No. 1598, Los Angeles County, CA</ref>

To sponsor the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]'s 1936 candidate for the [[California State Assembly]]'s [[California's 57th State Assembly district|57th District]], Ball signed a certificate stating, "I am registered as affiliated with the Communist Party."<ref>Testimony of Lucille Désirée Ball Arnaz, September 4, 1953, Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, 83d Cong., 1st sess., [https://books.google.com/books?id=y1pXKrPW0DoC Investigation of Communist Activities in the Los Angeles Area&nbsp;– Part 7], September 4, 1953 (Washington: United States Government Printing Office, 1953), p. 2567 (PDF p. 14)</ref> The same year, the Communist Party of California appointed her to the State [[Central Committee]], according to records of the [[California Secretary of State]].

In a 1944 [[British Pathé]] newsreel, titled ''Fund Raising for Roosevelt'', Ball was featured prominently among several stage and film stars at events in support of President [[Franklin D.

On September 4, 1953, Ball met voluntarily with HUAC investigator William A. Wheeler in Hollywood and gave him sealed testimony. She stated that she had registered to vote as a Communist "or intended to vote the Communist Party ticket" in 1936 at her socialist grandfather's insistence.<ref>Ball explained, "In those days, that was not a big, terrible thing to do.

Immediately before the filming of episode 68 ("The Girls Go Into Business") of ''I Love Lucy'', Desi Arnaz, instead of his usual audience warm-up, told the audience about Lucy and her grandfather. Reusing the line he had first given to [[Hedda Hopper]] in an interview, he quipped:{{quote|"The only thing red about Lucy is her hair, and even that is not legitimate."<ref>{{cite book|last=Brioux|first=Bill|title=Truth and Rumors: The Reality Behind Tv's Most Famous Myths|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voIe7XkFvEsC&pg=PA37|accessdate=July 4, 2012 |page=37 |isbn=9780275992477}}</ref>}}

==Personal life==
===Marriage, children, and divorce===
In 1940, Ball met Cuban-born bandleader Desi Arnaz while filming the [[Rodgers and Hart]] stage hit ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]''. When they met again on the second day, the two connected immediately and eloped the same year. Although Arnaz was drafted into the [[United States Army|Army]] in 1942, he ended up being classified for limited service due to a knee injury.<ref name="TCM">{{cite web|title=Arnaz, Desi|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/5686%7C37992/Desi-Arnaz/biography.html|publisher=tcm.com|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}</ref> As a result, Arnaz stayed in Los Angeles, organizing and performing [[USO]] shows for wounded [[G.I. (military)|GIs]] being brought back from the Pacific.

Ball filed for divorce in 1944, obtaining an [[interlocutory decree]]; however, she and Arnaz reconciled, which precluded the entry of a final decree.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Sanders|first1=Coyne S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W_n5s-2BGrkC&pg=PA20|title=Desilu|last2=Gilbert|first2=Tom|date=1994-05-31|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-688-13514-0|language=en}}</ref>

On July 17, 1951, one month before her 40th birthday, Ball gave birth to daughter [[Lucie Arnaz|Lucie Désirée Arnaz]].<ref name="Lucie"/> A year and a half later, Ball gave birth to her second child, [[Desi Arnaz Jr.|Desiderio Alberto Arnaz IV]], known as Desi Arnaz, Jr.<ref name="twoop-bio"/> Before he was born, ''I Love Lucy'' was a solid ratings hit, and Ball and Arnaz wrote the pregnancy into the show. (Ball's necessary and planned [[caesarean section]] in real life was scheduled for the same date that her television character gave birth.)<ref name="twoop-bio"/>

Several demands were made by CBS, insisting that a pregnant woman could not be shown on television, nor could the word "pregnant" be spoken on-air. After approval from several religious figures<ref name="Memo">{{cite news|title=Radio: Birth of a Memo|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,817789,00.html|date=January 26, 1953|work=Time|accessdate=June 14, 2011}}</ref> the network allowed the pregnancy storyline, but insisted that the word "expecting" be used instead of "pregnant".

The episode aired on the evening of January 19, 1953, with 44 million viewers watching Lucy Ricardo welcome little Ricky, while in real life Ball delivered her second child, Desi Jr., that same day in Los Angeles.  The birth made the cover of the first issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'' for the week of April 3–9, 1953.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hofer|first=Stephen F.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m6yvgvusRXoC&q=desi+arnaz+jr+cover+tv+guide&pg=PA7|title=TV Guide: The Official Collectors Guide|date=2006|publisher=Bangzoom Publishers|isbn=978-0-9772927-1-4|language=en}}</ref>

In October 1956, Ball, Arnaz, Vance, and [[William Frawley]] all appeared on a Bob Hope special on [[NBC]], including a spoof of ''I Love Lucy'', the only time all four stars were together on a color [[Broadcasting|telecast]]. By the end of the 1950s, Desilu had become a large company, causing a good deal of stress for both Ball and Arnaz.{{citation needed|date=March 2015|reason=Previous ref <!--http://members.tripod.com/TropicanaNightclub/desihistory.html--> not a reliable source}}

On March 3, 1960, a day after Desi's 43rd birthday (and one day after the filming the final episode of ''The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour''), Ball filed papers in Santa Monica Superior Court, claiming married life with Desi was "a nightmare" and nothing at all as it appeared on ''I Love Lucy''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Bart`|title=Lucy and Ricky and Fred and Ethel|year=1976|publisher=Clarke, Irwin & Company Limited|location=Toronto and Vancouver|page=166}}</ref> On May 4, 1960, the couple divorced; however, until his death in 1986, Arnaz and Ball remained friends and often spoke very fondly of each other.

The following year, Ball starred in the Broadway musical ''[[Wildcat (musical)|Wildcat]]'', which co-starred [[Keith Andes]] and [[Paula Stewart]]. It marked the beginning of a 30-year friendship between her and Stewart, who introduced Ball to second husband [[Gary Morton]], a [[Borscht Belt]] comic who was 13 years her junior.{{sfn|Sanders|Gilbert|1993|p=216}} According to Ball, Morton claimed he had never seen an episode of ''I Love Lucy'' due to his hectic work schedule. She immediately installed Morton in her production company, teaching him the television business and eventually promoting him to producer; he also played occasional bit parts on her various series.{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|pp=94, 103}}

Ball was outspokenly against the relationship her son had with actress [[Patty Duke]]. Later, commenting on when her son dated [[Liza Minnelli]], she was quoted as saying, "I miss Liza, but you cannot domesticate Liza."{{sfn|Kanfer|2003|pp=35–37}}

==Illness and death==
On April 18, 1989, Ball complained of chest pain at her home in Beverly Hills and was taken to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]], where she was diagnosed with a [[dissecting aortic aneurysm]] and underwent surgery to repair her aorta and a successful seven-hour [[aortic valve replacement]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Flint |first=Peter B.|date=1989-04-27|title=Lucille Ball, Spirited Doyenne Of TV Comedies, Dies at 77 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/27/obituaries/lucille-ball-spirited-doyenne-of-tv-comedies-dies-at-77.html |access-date=2020-07-11}}</ref>

==Recognition and legacy==
[[File:Lucille Ball (3831372291).jpg|thumb|Ball's Hollywood Walk of Fame star for her television work]]
Ball was the recipient of tributes, honors and many prestigious awards throughout her career and posthumously. On February 8, 1960, she was given two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: one at 6436 Hollywood Boulevard for contributions to [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures]], and one at 6100 Hollywood Boulevard for her contribution to the arts and sciences of television.<ref name="auto"/>
