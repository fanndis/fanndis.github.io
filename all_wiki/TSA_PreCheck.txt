The program has led to complaints of unfairness and longer wait lines.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-21/tsa-chief-john-pistole-gets-into-a-knife-fight|title=TSA Chief John Pistole Gets Into a Knife Fight|author=Jeff Plungis|date=22 March 2013|work=BusinessWeek|publisher=Bloomberg.com}}</ref> TSA says that PreCheck is not guaranteed every flight, as passengers are subject to random exclusions.<ref name="PreCheck FAQ" /> Furthermore, passengers may be disqualified or suspended from PreCheck for violations of federal transportation security regulations.<ref name="PreCheck FAQ" />

The TSA maintains a list of credit card issuers and loyalty programs that reimburse members' TSA PreCheck or [[Global Entry]] application fees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Credit Cards and Loyalty Programs featuring TSA Pre✓®|website=TSA.gov|publisher=Transportation Security Administration|url=https://www.tsa.gov/precheck/credit-cards-offer|access-date=September 2, 2019}}</ref>
