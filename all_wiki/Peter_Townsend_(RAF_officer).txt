[[Group Captain]] '''Peter Wooldridge Townsend''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CVO|DSO|DFC}} (22 November 1914{{spaced ndash}}19 June 1995) was a [[Royal Air Force]] officer, [[flying ace]], [[courtier]] and author. He was [[equerry]] to [[King George VI]] from 1944 to 1952 and held the same position for [[Queen Elizabeth II]] from 1952 to 1953. Townsend notably had a romance with [[Princess Margaret]], the Queen's only sibling.

==Early life==
Townsend was born in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[Burma]], to Lieutenant Colonel Edward Copleston Townsend<ref name=Barrymaine1958p19>Barrymaine, Norman (1958). ''The Peter Townsend Story''. E. P.

==RAF career==
Townsend joined the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1933 and trained at [[RAF Cranwell]]. He was commissioned a [[pilot officer]] on 27 July 1935.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34197|page=5743|date=10 September 1935}}</ref> On graduation, he joined [[No. 1 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Tangmere]] flying the [[Hawker Fury]] biplane fighter. In 1936 he was posted to [[No. 36 Squadron RAF]] in Singapore, flying the [[Vickers Vildebeest]] torpedo bomber.<ref>Townsend, P. ''Time and Chance'' 1978 Book Club Associates  pp84-93 with squadron photograph</ref> He was promoted to [[flying officer]] on 27 January 1937,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34374|page=1260|date=20 February 1937}}</ref> and returned to Tangmere that year as a member of [[No. 43 Squadron RAF]]. Townsend was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on 27 January 1939.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34598|page=1072|date=14 February 1939}}</ref>

The first enemy aircraft to crash on English soil during the Second World War fell victim to fighters from [[RAF Acklington]] in Northumberland on 3 February 1940, when three Hurricanes of ‘B’ flight, No. 43 Squadron, shot down a [[Luftwaffe]] [[Heinkel 111]] of [[Kampfgeschwader 26|4./KG 26]] near [[Whitby]]. The pilots were Flight Lieutenant Townsend, Flying Officer "Tiger" Folkes and Sergeant James Hallowes. Two more He 111s were claimed by Townsend, on 22 February and 8 April, and a sixth share on 22 April.  Enemy aircraft had been shot down in 1939 by the RAF from over Scotland's [[Scapa Flow]] naval base during the Luftwaffe's first raid on Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2today.com/peter-townsend-shoots-down-the-first-enemy-plane-over-england|title=3rd February 1940: Peter Townsend scores first with first plane shot down over England|work=WWII Today}}</ref> Townsend was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) in April 1940:<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34840|page=2556|date=30 April 1940}}</ref>

{{quote|Flight Lieutenant Peter Wooldridge Townsend (33178)
In April 1940, whilst on patrol over the North Sea, Flight Lieutenant Townsend intercepted and attacked an enemy aircraft at dusk and after a running fight shot it down. This is the third success obtained by this pilot and in each instance he has displayed qualities of leadership, skill and determination of the highest order, with little regard for his own safety.}}

By May 1940, Townsend was one of the most capable [[squadron leader]]s of the [[Battle of Britain]], serving throughout the battle as [[commanding officer]] of [[No. 85 Squadron RAF]], flying [[Hawker Hurricane]]s. On 11 July 1940, Acting Squadron Leader Townsend, flying Hurricane VY-K (P2716) intercepted a [[Dornier Do 17]] of [[KG 2]] and severely damaged the bomber, forcing it to crash land at [[Arras]]. Return fire from the Dornier hit the Hurricane coolant system and Townsend was forced to ditch {{convert|20|mi}} from the English coast, being rescued by HM Trawler ''Cape Finisterre''. He was [[mentioned in despatches]] the same month.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34893 |supp=y|page=4268|date=9 July 1940}}</ref> On 31 August, during combat with [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]s over [[Tonbridge]], Townsend was shot down and wounded in the left foot by a cannon shell which went through the [[glycol]] tank and exploded in the cockpit. He continued to lead the unit on the ground even after this wound resulted in his big toe being amputated, and he returned to operational flying on 21 September. Townsend was promoted to the substantive rank of squadron leader on 1 September 1940.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35525|page=1649|date=14 April 1942}}</ref> A [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DFC was awarded in early September 1940, for leading his squadron in protecting convoys during July and August 1940, personally shooting down four enemy aircraft and leading his squadron in destroying at least 10 enemy aircraft and damaging many others. Part of his citation reads:<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34940|page=5407|date=6 September 1940}}</ref>

{{quote|...The success which has been achieved has been due to Squadron Leader Townsend's unflagging zeal and leadership.}}

Townsend oversaw the conversion of No. 85 Squadron to night operations at [[RAF Hunsdon]] in Hertfordshire during early 1941. In May 1941, by now an acting [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] and credited with shooting down at least 11 enemy aircraft, Townsend was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO). His citation credited Townsend as an officer who had<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35161|page=2744|date=13 May 1941}}</ref>

{{quote|...displayed outstanding powers of leadership and organisation, combined with great determination and skill in air combat. By his untiring efforts he has contributed materially to the many successes obtained by his squadron.}}

Townsend was promoted to the temporary rank of [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] on 1 December 1941.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35383 |supp=y|page=7111|date=16 December 1941}}</ref> He later became commanding officer of [[RAF Drem]] in Scotland in April 1942 and commanded [[No. 611 Squadron RAF]], a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] unit. He was later leader of [[No. 605 Squadron RAF]], a [[night fighter]] unit, and attended the [[staff college]] from October 1942. In January 1943, he was appointed commanding officer of [[RAF West Malling]] in Kent. His wartime record was nine aircraft claimed destroyed, and two shared, two 'probables' and four damaged.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowman|first1=Martin|title=RAF Fighter Pilots in WWII|date=2015|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=9781783831920|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKagCgAAQBAJ&q=peter+townsend+raf&pg=PA149|accessdate=4 March 2018|language=en}}</ref>

In 1944, Townsend was appointed temporary [[equerry]] to [[George VI|King George VI]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=36425 |date=14 March 1944 |page=1229 |nolink=yes }}</ref> In the same year, the appointment was made permanent, and he served until 1953 when he became [[Extra Equerry]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=39904 |date=3 July 1953 |page=3676 |nolink=yes }}</ref> an honorary office he held until his death. He ended his wartime service with the temporary rank of wing commander and was promoted to the permanent rank of wing commander on 1 January 1949.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38490 |supp=y|page=6721|date=28 December 1948}}</ref>

In August 1950, Townsend was made deputy [[Master of the Household]] and was moved to [[comptroller]] to the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] in 1952.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38983 |date=1 August 1950 |page=3953 |nolink=yes }}</ref> He was promoted to [[group captain]] on 1 January 1953,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=39739 |supp=y|page=53|date=30 December 1952}}</ref> and retired from the [[Royal Household]] the same year.

Townsend served as [[air attaché]] in [[Brussels]] from 1953 to 1956, Townsend in 1970 said that he and Margaret did not correspond and they had not seen each other since a "friendly" 1958 meeting, "just like I think a lot of people never see their old girl friends".<ref name="upi19700904">{{Cite news |date=1970-09-04 |title=Townsend's Hurt of Rejection Healed |page=8 |work=Desert Sun |agency=UPI |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=DS19700904.2.51&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1 |access-date=2020-11-07}}</ref>
==Later life==
Townsend spent much of his later years writing non-fiction books. His books include ''Earth My Friend'' (about driving/boating around the world alone in the mid-1950s), ''Duel of Eagles'' (about the [[Battle of Britain]]), ''The Odds Against Us'' (also known as ''Duel in the Dark'', about fighting [[Luftwaffe]] night bombers in 1940–1941), ''The Last Emperor'' (a biography of [[King George VI]]), ''The Girl in the White Ship'' (about a young [[refugee]] from [[Vietnam]] in the late 1970s who was the sole survivor of her ship of refugees), ''The Postman of Nagasaki'' (about the [[atomic bombing]] of [[Nagasaki]]), and ''Time and Chance'' (an [[autobiography]]). He also wrote many short articles and contributed to other books.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Townsend was a director of one of [[Gerald Carroll]]'s [[Carroll Group]] companies.<ref name=sunbus>"SFO looks at 500m fall of Carroll empire", Dominic O'Connell, ''[[Sunday Business]]'', 1 October 2000, p. 1.</ref>

Townsend was one of several military advisors for the film ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'' (1969). He also appeared in the PBS video, ''The Windsors:  A Royal Family'' (1994).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Personal life==
On 17 July 1941, Townsend married [[Rosemary Pratt, Marchioness Camden|(Cecil) Rosemary Pawle]] (1921–2004). They had two sons, Giles (1942–2015) and Hugo (b. 1945). The younger son married Yolande, [[House of Ligne|Princess of Ligne]], daughter of [[Antoine, 13th Prince of Ligne]] and [[Alix, Princess of Ligne]] (''née'' Princess Alix of Luxembourg). Townsend and Pawle divorced in 1952. Pawle married, secondly, John de László (son of the painter [[Philip de László]]), and thirdly, in 1978, the [[Marquess Camden|5th Marquess Camden]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

{{see also|Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon#Romance with Peter Townsend}}
After the divorce, Townsend and [[Princess Margaret]] formed a relationship and decided to marry. He had met her in his role as an [[equerry]] to her father, [[King George VI]]. Divorcees suffered severe disapproval in the social atmosphere of the time and could not remarry in the [[Church of England]] if their former spouse was still alive. Their relationship was considered especially controversial because Margaret's sister, Queen Elizabeth II, was the Church's [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

When news of the relationship appeared in the press, the government posted Townsend to a position as air attaché at the British Embassy in Brussels. On 31 October 1955, Princess Margaret issued a statement ending the relationship: "I have been aware that, subject to my renouncing my rights of succession, it might have been possible for me to contract a civil marriage. But, mindful of the Church's teachings that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before others." The BBC interrupted its scheduled radio programme to broadcast the statement.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/31/newsid_3202000/3202307.stm "1955: Princess Margaret cancels wedding"].

''The Daily Telegraph''.</ref>

In 1959, aged 45, Townsend married 20-year-old Marie-Luce Jamagne, a Belgian national he had met the previous year.<ref name=jrg2feb>{{cite news|last=Gregory|first=Joseph R.|title=Princess Margaret Dies at 71; Sister of Queen Elizabeth Had a Troubled Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/10/world/princess-margaret-dies-at-71-sister-of-queen-elizabeth-had-a-troubled-life.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=1 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 February 2002}}</ref> They had two daughters and one son. Their younger daughter, Isabelle Townsend, became a [[Ralph Lauren]] model in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Isabelle Townsend and her family renovated and lived at ''Le Moulin de la Tuilerie'' in [[Gif-sur-Yvette]], where the [[Edward VIII|Duke]] and [[Wallis Simpson|Duchess of Windsor]] had once lived.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Love Story|last1=Petkanas|first1=Christopher|magazine=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=October 2010|page =309}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/moulin-13625/|title=Le Moulin – Restoration |work=[[Landmark Trust|The Landmark Trust]] |access-date=30 January 2019}}</ref>

==Death and legacy==
[[File:St Léger 78 Peter Townsend.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|right|Stele of the grave in the churchyard of [[Saint-Léger-en-Yvelines]], France.]]
Townsend died of [[stomach cancer]] in 1995, in [[Saint-Léger-en-Yvelines]], France. He was 80 years old. ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote in Townsend's obituary that "He developed, too, a perceptible sense of relief that things turned out the way they did", because "for men like [[Mark Phillips]] and Princess Margaret's eventual husband [[Anthony Armstrong-Jones]], [marrying into the royal family] turned out to be an almost impossible undertaking".<ref name="delanoy19950621">{{Cite news |last=De-la-Noy |first=Michael |date=1995-06-21 |title=Obituary: Gp Capt Peter Townsend |language=en |work=The Independent |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-gp-capt-peter-townsend-1587526.html |access-date=2020-11-07}}</ref>

In 2002, a sculpture of Townsend, designed by [[Guy Portelli]], was erected at Townsend Square, part of the [[Kings Hill]] development, on the site formerly occupied by the [[RAF West Malling]] airfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portelli-sculptor.co.uk/index.php?inc=about|title=Guy Portelli Sculpture Studio|publisher=}}</ref>
