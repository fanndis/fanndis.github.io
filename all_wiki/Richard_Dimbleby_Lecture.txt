The '''''Richard Dimbleby Lecture''''' (also known as the '''''Dimbleby Lecture''''') is an annual television lecture founded in memory of [[Richard Dimbleby]] (1913â€”1965), the [[BBC]] [[Television presenter|broadcaster]]. 

It has been delivered by an influential business, scientific or political figure almost every year since 1972 (with gaps in 1981, 1991, 1993 and 2008). The lecture is introduced in alternate years by his sons [[David Dimbleby]] and [[Jonathan Dimbleby]], both broadcasters for the BBC, and delivered in front of an invited audience of guests, often with a link to the specialism of the speaker.
