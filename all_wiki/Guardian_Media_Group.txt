'''Guardian Media Group plc''' ('''GMG''') is a British based [[mass media]] company owning various media operations including ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]''. The group is wholly owned by [[Scott Trust Limited]], which exists to secure the financial and editorial independence of ''The Guardian'' in perpetuity.

The Group's 2018 annual report (year ending 1 April 2018) indicated that the Scott Trust Endowment Fund was valued at £1.01 billion (2017: £1.03bn).<ref name="auto">{{cite news |title=Guardian Media Group plc (GMG) results for the financial year ended 1 April 2018 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2018/jul/24/guardian-media-group-plc-gmg-results-for-the-financial-year-ended-1-april-2018 |work=The Guardian |date=24 July 2018}}</ref>

==History==
The company was founded as the Manchester Guardian Ltd. in 1907 when [[C. P. Scott]] bought the ''Manchester Guardian'' (founded in 1821)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/the-scott-trust/history/ |title=History &#124; Guardian Media Group PLC |publisher=Gmgplc.co.uk |access-date=2013-10-25}}</ref> from the estate of his cousin Edward Taylor.

It became the Manchester Guardian and Evening News Ltd when it bought out the ''Manchester Evening News'' in 1924, later becoming the '''Guardian and Manchester Evening News Ltd''' to reflect the change in the morning paper's title.  It adopted its current name in 1993. 

In 1991 it had a 20% stake in a consortium which included [[London Weekend Television|LWT]], [[Scottish Television|STV]], [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[Carlton Communications]] for a new ITV breakfast franchise called [[GMTV]]

''Guardian Monthly'' was a glossy magazine published by the Guardian Media Group for readers around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/guardian-to-launch-monthly-mag/|title=Guardian to launch monthly mag|date=2006-09-05|website=[[Press Gazette]]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-27}}</ref> Launched in November 2006,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/media-choice-guardian-monthly/607053|title=Media choice: Guardian Monthly|date=2006-11-29|work=[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]|access-date=2018-09-27}}</ref> it made selections from ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]''’s magazine supplements available to an international audience of English-speakers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/05/newguardianmonthlymagtobe|title=New Guardian Monthly mag to be launched|last=Armstrong|first=Murray|date=2006-10-05|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-09-27}}</ref> Issues contained interviews with cultural figures, features about world issues, and regular articles on travel, books, sport, health, fashion, food and photography. In July 2007, the Guardian Media Group announced the cancellation of the ''Guardian Monthly''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/guardian-monthly-ceases-publication/|title=Guardian Monthly ceases publication|date=2007-07-30|website=[[Press Gazette]]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-27}}</ref> In a letter to subscribers, Will Ricketts, ''Guardian Monthly''<nowiki/>'s publisher, explained the reasons for the cancellation of the monthly magazine:
{{Block quote|The company is taking a long-term strategic view of its activities and although ''Guardian Monthly'' has performed well in the busy and competitive international marketplace, we have decided that it is not the right time to continue with a global magazine offering.}}

In March 2007 GMG sold 49.9% of [[Auto Trader Group|Trader Media Group]] to [[Apax Partners]], in a deal that valued Trader Media Group at £1.35 billion.  In December 2007 it was announced that GMG and Apax had made a successful bid to buy [[Ascential|Emap]]'s business-to-business arm for around £1 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/dec/21/emap.guardianmediagroup|title=Emap confirms B2B sale to GMG and Apax|author=Mark Sweney|work=the Guardian}}</ref>

In February 2010, the group sold its GMG Regional Media division (consisting of two companies MEN Media and S&B Media which operated 31 local and regional newspaper titles) to [[Trinity Mirror]] for £44.8 million. The sale ended the historic connection between ''The Guardian'' and Manchester as the sale of the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' was included in the package.<ref name="M.E.N sold to Trinity Mirror">{{cite web

In October 2017, the Guardian Media Group reported a plan to launch a new £42 million venture capital fund.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/10/18/guardian-turns-venture-capitalist-hunt-new-income/|title=The Guardian turns venture capitalist in hunt for new income|date=18 October 2017|website=The Telegraph}}</ref> That plan was consummated, making the Scott Trust a limited partner in GMG Ventures LP. According to the GMG 2018 annual report, "this £42m venture capital fund is designed to contribute financial returns and to support GMG’s strategy by investing in early stage businesses focused on developing the next generation of media technology".<ref name="auto"/>

In January 2020 GMG announced [[Annette Thomas]], former editor of [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], MD of [[Nature Publishing Group]] and chief executive of [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Science and Education]], as its new chief executive. She replaced [[David Pemsel]] who left to take up a role at the [[Premier League]].<ref name=pg-20200114>{{cite news |url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/guardian-media-group-annette-thomas-chief-executive/ |title=Guardian group names scientist Annette Thomas as new chief executive |last=Mayhew |first=Freddy |newspaper=Press Gazette |date=14 January 2020 |access-date=15 January 2020}}</ref>

==Group structure==

GMG’s core business is Guardian News & Media Limited, publisher of theguardian.com, and ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'' newspapers. Guardian News & Media was formed as Guardian Newspapers Limited in 1967, adopting its present name in 2006.

The group has a portfolio of investments to help support its journalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/gmg/our-investments/ |title=Our investments &#124; Guardian Media Group PLC |publisher=Gmgplc.co.uk |access-date=2013-10-25}}</ref> They comprise:
* [[Ascential]]: an international business-to-business digital intelligence and events business.
* GMG Property Services: a provider of software, technology and design solutions to the property industry.
* An externally managed investment fund.

Guardian Media Group exists to support the core purpose of its owner, Scott Trust Limited: to secure the financial and editorial independence of ''The Guardian'' in perpetuity,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/the-scott-trust|title=The Scott Trust - The Guardian|work=the Guardian}}</ref> but in the 2011/12 year the group lost £75.6 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/press-releases/2012/guardian-media-group-plc-gmg-announces-full-year-results-for-201112/|title=Guardian Media Group plc (GMG) announces full-year results for 2011/2012|work=the Guardian}}</ref> and for the three years up to June 2012, the paper itself lost £100,000 a day - leading ''[[Intelligent Life (magazine)|Intelligent Life]]'' magazine to question whether ''The Guardian'' can survive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moreintelligentlife.com/content/ideas/tim-de-lisle/can-guardian-survive |title=Can The Guardian Survive? |publisher=More Intelligent Life |access-date=2013-10-25}}</ref> In 2014, ''The Guardian'' launched a membership scheme, aiming to avoid introducing a [[paywall]] and maintaining open access to the website. As of 2018 this approach was considered successful, having brought more than 1 million subscriptions or donations, with the paper hoping to break even by April 2019,<ref name=guardian-20181112>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/nov/12/katharine-viner-guardian-million-reader-funding |title=The Guardian's reader funding model is working.
