'''Child abuse''' or '''child maltreatment''' is [[physical abuse|physical]], [[child sexual abuse|sexual]], and/or [[psychological abuse|psychological]] maltreatment or [[Child neglect|neglect]] of a child or children, especially by a parent or a caregiver. Child abuse may include any act or failure to act by a parent or a caregiver that results in actual or potential harm  to a child, and can occur in a child's home, or in the organizations, schools or communities the child interacts with.

The terms ''child abuse'' and ''child maltreatment'' are often used interchangeably, although some researchers make a distinction between them, treating ''child maltreatment'' as an [[umbrella term]] to cover neglect, exploitation, and [[Human trafficking|trafficking]].

Different [[jurisdictions]] have developed their own stance towards [[mandatory reporting]], different definitions of what constitutes child abuse for the purposes of removing children from their families or for prosecuting a [[criminal charge]].

==History==
Two centuries ago, cruelty to children, perpetrated by employers and teachers, was widespread, and corporal punishment customary in many countries. But, in the first half of the 19th century, pathologists studying [[filicide]] (the parental killing of children) reported cases of death from paternal rage,<ref>Editorial (1848) Triple infanticide – suicide du meurtrier. Annales Médico-psycholiques 11: 108 only.</ref> recurrent physical maltreatment,<ref>Leuret (1837) Suspicion de folie chez une femme reconnue coupable d'avoir, pendant sa grossesse fait des blessures mortelles a deux de ses enfans: affaire R.

Henke's Zeitschrift für der Staatsarzneikunde 50: 139-156.</ref> and sexual abuse.<ref>Boys-de-Loury, Devergie, Ollivier (1843) Consultation medico-légale sur un cas de mort violente, chez un enfant de deux ans et demi. Annales d'Hygiène Publique et de Médecine Légale 29: 185-203.</ref> In 1860, a key paper gathered together a series of 32 such cases, of which 18 were fatal, the children dying from starvation and/or recurrent physical abuse; it included the case of Adeline Defert, who was returned by her grandparents at the age of 8, and for 9 years tortured by her parents – whipped every day, hung up by her thumbs and beaten with a nailed plank, burnt with hot coals and her wounds bathed in nitric acid, and deflorated with a baton.<ref>Tardieu A (1860) Étude médico-légale sur les sévices et mauvais traitements exercés sur des enfants. Annales d’Hygiène 15: 361-398.</ref> Tardieu made home visits and observed the effect on the children; he noticed that the sadness and fear on their faces disappeared when they were placed under protection. He commented, “When we consider the tender age of these poor defenceless beings, subjected daily and almost hourly to savage atrocities, unimaginable tortures and harsh privation, their lives one long martyrdom – and when we face the fact that their tormentors are the very mothers who gave them life, we are confronted with one of the most appalling problems that can disturb the soul of a moralist, or the conscience of justice”.<ref> Brockington I F (1996) Motherhood and Mental Health. Oxford, Oxford University Press, page 396 – translation of a passage in Tardieu (1860).</ref> His observations were echoed by Boileau de Castélnau (who introduced the term misopédie – hatred of children),<ref>Boileau de Castélnau P (1861) Misopédie ou lesion de l'amour de la progéniture. Annales Médico-psychologiques 3rd series 7: 553-568.</ref> and confirmed by Aubry <ref>Aubry P (1891) De l’Homicide Commis par la Femme. Paris, Storck, pp 1-38.</ref> and several theses.<ref>Delcasse A (1885) Étude medico-légale sur les sévices de l’enfance. Thèse, Paris.</ref><ref>Duval P (1892) Des sévices et mauvais traitements. Thèse, Lyon.</ref><ref>Dumas E (1892) Du libéricide ou meurtre des enfants mineurs par leurs parents. Thèse, Lyon.</ref> But these French observations failed to cross the language barrier, and other nations remained ignorant of the cause of many traumatic lesions in infants and toddlers; it was almost one hundred years before mankind confronted Tardieu’s ‘appalling problem’. In the 20th century, evidence began to accumulate from pathology and paediatric radiology, particularly in relation to chronic subdural haematoma and limb fractures: subdural haematoma had a curious bimodal distribution, idiopathic in infants and traumatic in adults, <ref> Sherwood D (1930) Chronic subdural haematoma in infants. American Journal of Diseases of Children 39: 980-1021.</ref> while unexplained ossifying periostitis of the long bones was similar to that occurring after breech extractions.<ref> Snedecor S T, Knapp R E, Wilson H B (1935) Traumatic ossifying periostitis of the newborn. Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics 61: 385-387.</ref> In 1946, Caffey drew attention to the association of long bone fractures and chronic subdural haematoma,<ref> Caffey J (1946) Multiple fractures in long bones of infant suffering from chronic subdural haematoma. American Journal of Roentgenology 56: 163-173.</ref> and, in 1955, it was noticed that infants removed from the care of aggressive, immature and emotionally ill parents developed no new lesions.<ref>Woolley P V, Evans W A (1955) Significance of skeletal lesions in infants resembling those of traumatic origin. Journal of the American Medical Association 158: 539-543.</ref>

As a result, professional inquiry into the topic began again in the 1960s.<ref name=McCoyIntro /> The July 1962 publication of the paper "The Battered Child-Syndrome" authored principally to pediatric psychiatrist [[C. Henry Kempe]] and published in ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' represents the moment that child maltreatment entered mainstream awareness. Before the article's publication, injuries to children—even repeated bone fractures—were not commonly recognized as the results of intentional trauma. Instead, physicians often looked for undiagnosed [[bone disease]]s or accepted parents' accounts of accidental mishaps such as falls or assaults by neighborhood bullies.<ref name=Childism/>{{rp|100&ndash;103}}

The study of child abuse emerged as an academic discipline in the early 1970s in the United States. [[Elisabeth Young-Bruehl]] maintains that despite the growing numbers of child advocates and interest in protecting children which took place, the grouping of children into "the abused" and the "non-abused" created an artificial distinction that narrowed the concept of [[children's rights]] to simply protection from maltreatment, and blocked investigation of the ways in which children are discriminated against in society generally. Another effect of the way child abuse and neglect have been studied, according to Young-Bruehl, was to close off consideration of how children themselves perceive maltreatment and the importance they place on adults' attitudes toward them. Young-Bruehl writes that when the belief in children's inherent inferiority to adults is present in society, all children suffer whether or not their treatment is labeled as "abuse".<ref name=Childism/>{{rp|15&ndash;16}}

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines ''child abuse'' and ''child maltreatment'' as "all forms of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power."<ref name="WHO abuse and neglect">{{cite web|title=Child abuse and neglect by parents and other caregivers|page=3|access-date=8 March 2016|work=[[World Health Organization]]|url=https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap3.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092230/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap3.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) uses the term ''child maltreatment'' to refer to both acts of commission (abuse), which include "words or overt actions that cause harm, potential harm, or threat of harm to a child", and acts of omission (neglect), meaning "the failure to provide for a child's basic physical, emotional, or educational needs or to protect a child from harm or potential harm".<ref name=Surveillance />{{rp|11}} The United States federal [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] defines ''child abuse and neglect'' as, at minimum, "any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation" or "an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Herrenkohl RC | title = The definition of child maltreatment: from case study to construct | journal = Child Abuse and Neglect | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 413–24 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15970317 | doi = 10.1016/j.chiabu.2005.04.002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Definitions of Child Abuse and Neglect in Federal Law |website=childwelfare.gov |publisher=Children’s Bureau, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/can/defining/federal/ |access-date=20 February 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516131820/https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/can/defining/federal/ |archive-date=16 May 2016  }}</ref>

==Types==
As of 2006, the World Health Organization distinguishes four types of child maltreatment: [[physical abuse]]; [[Child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]]; [[Emotional abuse|emotional (or psychological) abuse]]; and [[Child neglect|neglect]].<ref name="Nature&Consequences" />

===Physical abuse===
Among professionals and the general public, there is disagreement as to what behaviors constitute [[physical abuse]] of a child.<ref name="anh">Noh Anh, Helen (1994). "Cultural Diversity and the Definition of Child Abuse", in Barth, R.P. et al., ''Child Welfare Research Review'', Columbia University Press, 1994, p. 28. {{ISBN|0-231-08074-3}}</ref> Physical abuse often does not occur in isolation, but as part of a constellation of behaviors including authoritarian control, anxiety-provoking behavior, and a lack of parental warmth.<ref name=SocialSciences /> The WHO defines physical abuse as:

{{Quote|Intentional use of physical force against the child that results in{{snd}}or has a high likelihood of resulting in{{snd}}harm for the child's health, survival, development or dignity. This includes hitting, beating, kicking, shaking, biting, strangling, scalding, burning, poisoning and suffocating. Much physical violence against children in the home is inflicted with the object of punishing.<ref name="Nature&Consequences">{{cite book |author=World Health Organization and International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect |chapter=1.

Overlapping definitions of physical abuse and [[physical punishment]] of children highlight a subtle or non-existent distinction between abuse and punishment,<ref>{{cite book |author1=Saunders, Bernadette |author2=Goddard, Chris |date=2010 |title=Physical Punishment in Childhood: The Rights of the Child |url=https://archive.org/details/physicalpunishme00saun |url-access=limited |location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |pages=[https://archive.org/details/physicalpunishme00saun/page/n13 2]–3 |isbn=978-0-470-72706-5}}</ref> but most physical abuse is physical punishment "in intent, form, and effect".<ref name=Lessons />  As of 2006, for instance, [[Paulo Sergio Pinheiro]] wrote in the UN Secretary-General's Study on Violence Against Children:

{{quote |Corporal punishment involves hitting ('smacking', 'slapping', 'spanking') children, with the hand or with an implement – whip, stick, belt, shoe, wooden spoon, etc. But it can also involve, for example, kicking, shaking or throwing children, scratching, pinching, biting, pulling hair or boxing ears, forcing children to stay in uncomfortable positions, burning, scalding or forced ingestion (for example, washing children's mouths out with soap or forcing them to swallow hot spices).<ref name=ViolenceStudy3>{{cite book |author=Pinheiro, Paulo Sérgio |date=2006 |chapter=Violence against children in the home and family |chapter-url=http://www.unicef.org/violencestudy/3.%20World%20Report%20on%20Violence%20against%20Children.pdf |title=World Report on Violence Against Children |location=Geneva, Switzerland |publisher=United Nations Secretary-General's Study on Violence Against Children |isbn=978-92-95057-51-7 |url=http://www.unviolencestudy.org/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111110523/http://unviolencestudy.org/ |archive-date=11 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}

The psychologist [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]], noted for her books on child abuse, took the view that humiliations, spankings and beatings, slaps in the face, etc. are all forms of abuse, because they injure the integrity and dignity of a child, even if their consequences are not visible right away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alice-miller.com|title=Alice Miller – Child Abuse and Mistreatment|access-date=5 March 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109133036/http://www.alice-miller.com/|archive-date=9 January 2016}}</ref>

Physical abuse as a child can lead to physical and mental difficulties in the future, including re-victimization, personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorders, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, eating disorders, substance abuse, and aggression.

===Psychological abuse===
{{Main|Psychological abuse}}

There are multiple definitions of child psychological abuse:
* In 2013, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) added Child Psychological Abuse to the [[DSM-5]], describing it as "nonaccidental verbal or symbolic acts by a child's parent or caregiver that result, or have reasonable potential to result, in significant psychological harm to the child."<ref name=dsm5Guidbook>{{cite book|author=Donald Black|title=DSM-5® Guidebook: The Essential Companion to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JuvBAAAQBAJ&q=%22nonaccidental+verbal+or+symbolic+acts+by+a+child%27s+parent+or+caregiver+that++result,+or+have+reasonable+potential+to+result,+in+significant+psychological++harm+to+the+child.%22&pg=PA423 |page=423|isbn=978-1-58562-465-2|date=1 February 2014 }}</ref>
* In 1995, APSAC defined it as: spurning, terrorizing, isolating, exploiting, corrupting, denying emotional responsiveness, or neglect" or "A repeated pattern of caregiver behavior or extreme incident(s) that convey to children that they are worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted, endangered, or only of value in meeting another's needs"<ref name=Myers2012>{{cite book|author=John E.

* In the United States, states laws vary, but most have laws against "mental injury"<ref name=mentalInjury>{{cite web|title=Child Abuse Laws State-by-State|url=http://family.findlaw.com/child-abuse/child-abuse-laws-state-by-state.html|website=findLaw|access-date=25 September 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008015855/http://family.findlaw.com/child-abuse/child-abuse-laws-state-by-state.html|archive-date=8 October 2015}}</ref>
* Some have defined it as the production of psychological and social defects in the growth of a child as a result of behavior such as loud yelling, coarse and rude attitude, inattention, harsh criticism, and denigration of the child's personality.<ref name="Theoklitou, D 2011" /> Other examples include name-calling, ridicule, degradation, destruction of personal belongings, [[Cruelty to animals|torture or killing of a pet]], excessive [[criticism]], inappropriate or excessive demands, withholding communication, and routine labeling or [[humiliation]].<ref name="ncvc-ca">{{cite web|url=http://ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&DocumentAction=ViewProperties&DocumentID=32313&UrlToReturn=http%3a%2f%2fncvc.org%2fncvc%2fmain.aspx%3fdbName%3dAdvancedSearch&gclid=CJ_1q6m2oZ4CFcx25QodNG2_ow |title=Child Abuse |publisher=The National Center for Victims of Crime |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727114517/http://ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&DocumentAction=ViewProperties&DocumentID=32313&UrlToReturn=http%3A%2F%2Fncvc.org%2Fncvc%2Fmain.aspx%3FdbName%3DAdvancedSearch&gclid=CJ_1q6m2oZ4CFcx25QodNG2_ow |archive-date=27 July 2011  }}</ref>

In 2014, the APA stated that:<ref name=apaRelease>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/10/psychological-abuse.aspx|title=Childhood Psychological Abuse as Harmful as Sexual or Physical Abuse|publisher=The American Psychological Association|date=8 October 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208144610/http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/10/psychological-abuse.aspx|archive-date=8 December 2015}}</ref>
* "Childhood psychological abuse [is] as harmful as sexual or physical abuse."
* "Nearly 3 million U.S. children experience some form of [psychological] maltreatment annually."
* Psychological maltreatment is "the most challenging and prevalent form of child abuse and neglect."
* "Given the prevalence of childhood psychological abuse and the severity of harm to young victims, it should be at the forefront of mental health and social service training"

In 2015, additional research confirmed these 2014 statements of the APA.<ref name=McGill>{{cite web|last1=McGill University|title=Different types of child abuse: Similar consequences|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/10/151014121059.htm|website=Science News|access-date=11 December 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218064639/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/10/151014121059.htm|archive-date=18 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=Loudenback2015>{{cite web|last1=Loudenback|first1=Jeremy|title=Is Emotional Abuse as Harmful as Physical and Sexual Abuse?|url=https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/featured/emotional-abuse-harmful-physical-sexual-abuse/13944|website=Chronicle of Social Change|access-date=11 December 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222112008/https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/featured/emotional-abuse-harmful-physical-sexual-abuse/13944|archive-date=22 December 2015|date=25 October 2015}}</ref>

Victims of emotional abuse may react by distancing themselves from the abuser, internalizing the abusive words, or fighting back by [[insult]]ing the abuser. Emotional abuse can result in abnormal or disrupted [[attachment theory|attachment development]], a tendency for victims to blame themselves ([[self-blame]]) for the abuse, [[learned helplessness]], and overly passive behavior.<ref name="ncvc-ca" />

===Neglect===
{{Main|Child neglect}}
Child neglect is the failure of a parent or other person with responsibility for the child, to provide needed food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or supervision to the degree that the child's health, safety or well-being may be threatened with harm. Neglect is also a lack of attention from the people surrounding a child, and the non-provision of the relevant and adequate necessities for the child's survival, which would be a lack of attention, love, and nurturing.<ref name="Theoklitou, D 2011" />

Some observable signs of child neglect include: the child is frequently absent from school, begs or steals food or money, lacks needed medical and dental care, is consistently dirty, or lacks appropriate clothing for the weather.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chronic Neglect |url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf#Page=2&view=Fit |access-date=10 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011062659/http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |archive-date=11 October 2007 }}</ref> The 2010 Child Maltreatment Report (NCANDS), a yearly [[United States federal government]] report based on data supplied by state [[Child Protective Services]] (CPS) Agencies in the U.S., found that neglect/neglectful behavior was the "most common form of child maltreatment ".<ref name="childwelfare.gov">{{cite web|url=https://childwelfare.gov/pubs/factsheets/canstats.pdf|title=Child Maltreatment 2010: Summary of Key Findings|publisher=Children's Bureau, Child Welfare Information Gateway, Protecting Children Strengthening Families|access-date=<!-- May 2012 -->|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916043419/http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/factsheets/canstats.pdf|archive-date=16 September 2012}}</ref>

Neglectful acts can be divided into six sub-categories:<ref name=AIFSWhat />
*Supervisory neglect: characterized by the absence of a parent or guardian which can lead to physical harm, sexual abuse, or criminal behavior;
*Physical neglect: characterized by the failure to provide the basic physical necessities, such as a safe and clean home;
*Medical neglect: characterized by the lack of providing medical care;
*Emotional neglect: characterized by a lack of nurturance, encouragement, and support;
*Educational neglect: characterized by the caregivers lack to provide an education and additional resources to actively participate in the school system; and
*Abandonment: when the parent or guardian leaves a child alone for a long period of time without a babysitter or caretaker.

Neglected children may experience delays in physical and psychosocial development, possibly resulting in [[psychopathology]] and impaired [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] functions including [[executive function]], [[attention]], [[cognitive processing speed|processing speed]], language, memory and [[social skill]]s.<ref name="test">{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/families/resources/newsletter/2012/07/neurocognitive-impacts.aspx|title=Neurocognitive impacts for children of poverty and neglect|publisher=Apa.org|date=July 2012|access-date=24 December 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131122212/http://www.apa.org/pi/families/resources/newsletter/2012/07/neurocognitive-impacts.aspx|archive-date=31 January 2013}}</ref> Researchers investigating maltreated children have repeatedly found that neglected children in the foster and adoptive populations manifest different emotional and behavioral reactions to regain lost or secure relationships and are frequently reported to have disorganized attachments and a need to control their environment. Such children are not likely to view caregivers as being a source of safety, and instead typically show an increase in aggressive and hyperactive behaviors which may disrupt healthy or secure attachment with their adopted parents. These children seem to have learned to adapt to an abusive and inconsistent caregiver by becoming cautiously self-reliant, and are often described as glib, manipulative and disingenuous in their interactions with others as they move through childhood.<ref name="Golden, J.A. 2009">{{cite journal | author = Golden J.A., Prather W. | s2cid = 45317073 | year = 2009 | title = A behavioral perspective of childhood trauma and attachment issues: toward alternative treatment approaches for children with a history of abuse | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy| volume = 5 | pages = 56–74 | doi = 10.1037/h0100872 }}</ref> Children who are victims of neglect can have a more difficult time forming and maintaining relationships, such as romantic or friendship, later in life due to the lack of attachment they had in their earlier stages of life.

===Emotional===
Child abuse can cause a range of emotional effects. Children who are constantly ignored, shamed, terrorized or humiliated suffer at least as much, if not more, than if they are physically assaulted.<ref name="americanhumane.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumane.org/children/stop-child-abuse/fact-sheets/emotional-abuse.html |title=Emotional Abuse |work=American Humane Association |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422054312/http://www.americanhumane.org/children/stop-child-abuse/fact-sheets/emotional-abuse.html |archive-date=22 April 2015  }}</ref> According to the Joyful Heart Foundation, brain development of the child is greatly influenced and responds to the experiences with families, caregivers, and the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.joyfulheartfoundation.org/learn/child-abuse-neglect/effects-child-abuse-neglect|title=www.joyfulheartfoundation.org/learn/child-abuse-neglect/effects-child-abuse-neglect|website=www.joyfulheartfoundation.org|access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref> Abused children can grow up experiencing insecurities, low self-esteem, and lack of development. Many abused children experience ongoing difficulties with trust, social withdrawal, trouble in school, and forming relationships.<ref name="americanhumane.org" />

Babies and other young children can be affected differently by abuse than their older counterparts. Babies and pre-school children who are being emotionally abused or neglected may be overly affectionate towards strangers or people they haven't known for very long.<ref name="nspcc.org.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-abuse-and-neglect/emotional-abuse/emotional-abuse-signs-symptoms-effects/|title=Emotional abuse: Signs, symptoms and effects|work=NSPCC|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426202832/http://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-abuse-and-neglect/emotional-abuse/emotional-abuse-signs-symptoms-effects|archive-date=26 April 2015}}</ref> They can lack confidence or become anxious, appear to not have a close relationship with their parent, exhibit aggressive behavior or act nasty towards other children and animals.<ref name="nspcc.org.uk" /> Older children may use foul language or act in a markedly different way to other children at the same age, struggle to control strong emotions, seem isolated from their parents, lack social skills or have few, if any, friends.<ref name="nspcc.org.uk" />

Children can also experience [[reactive attachment disorder]] (RAD). RAD is defined as markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness, that usually begins before the age of 5 years.<ref name=Medscape>{{cite web|title=Reactive attachment disorder|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/775782_3|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511231642/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/775782_3|archive-date=11 May 2015}}{{subscription needed}}</ref> RAD can present as a persistent failure to start or respond in a developmentally appropriate fashion to most social situations. The long-term impact of emotional abuse has not been studied widely, but recent studies have begun to document its long-term consequences. Emotional abuse has been linked to increased depression, anxiety, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships (Spertus, Wong, Halligan, & Seremetis, 2003).<ref name=Medscape /> Victims of child abuse and neglect are more likely to commit crimes as juveniles and adults.<ref>{{cite web|title=Impact of child abuse|url=http://www.asca.org.au/About/Resources/Impact-of-child-abuse.aspx|work=Adults Surviving Child Abuse (ASCA)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424063756/http://www.asca.org.au/About/Resources/Impact-of-child-abuse.aspx|archive-date=24 April 2015|access-date=21 April 2015}}</ref>

[[Domestic violence]] also takes its toll on children; although the child is not the one being abused, the child witnessing the domestic violence is greatly influential as well. Research studies conducted such as the "Longitudinal Study on the Effects of Child Abuse and Children's Exposure to Domestic Violence", show that 36.8% of children engage in felony assault compared to the 47.5% of abused/assaulted children. Research has shown that children exposed to domestic violence increases the chances of experienced behavioral and emotional problems (depression, irritability, anxiety, academic problems, and problems in language development).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/media/files/BehindClosedDoors.pdf|title=Behind Closed Doors: The Impact of Domestic Violence on Children|date=2006|website=UNICEF}}</ref>

Overall, emotional effects caused by child abuse and even witnessing abuse can result in long-term and short-term effects that ultimately affect a child's upbringing and development.

===Physical===
[[File:Fractured ribs.jpg|thumb|[[Rib fracture]]s in an infant secondary to child [[abuse]]]]

The immediate physical effects of abuse or neglect can be relatively minor (bruises or cuts) or severe (broken bones, hemorrhage, or even death). In some cases the physical effects are temporary; however, the pain and suffering they cause a child should not be discounted. Rib fractures may be seen with physical abuse, and if present may increase suspicion of abuse, but are found in a small minority of children with maltreatment-related injuries.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kemp AM, Dunstan F, Harrison S, Morris S, Mann M, Rolfe K, Datta S, Thomas DP, Sibert JR, Maguire S | title = Patterns of skeletal fractures in child abuse: systematic review | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | issue = oct02 1 | pages = a1518 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18832412 | pmc = 2563260 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a1518 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Joseph Jonathan|last2=Gonzalez-Izquierdo|first2=Arturo|last3=Gilbert|first3=Ruth|date=31 October 2012|title=Risk of Maltreatment-Related Injury: A Cross-Sectional Study of Children under Five Years Old Admitted to Hospital with a Head or Neck Injury or Fracture|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=10|pages=e46522|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0046522|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3485294|pmid=23118853|bibcode=2012PLoSO...746522L}}</ref>

The [[Adverse Childhood Experiences Study]] is a long-running investigation into the relationship between childhood adversity, including various forms of abuse and neglect, and health problems in later life. The initial phase of the study was conducted in [[San Diego, California]] from 1995 to 1997.<ref name=CDCACE /> The World Health Organization summarizes the study as: "childhood maltreatment and household dysfunction contribute to the development – decades later – of the chronic diseases that are the most common causes of death and disability in the United States... A strong relationship was seen between the number of adverse experiences (including physical and sexual abuse in childhood) and self-reports of cigarette smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, attempted suicide, sexual promiscuity and sexually transmitted diseases in later life."<ref name="Nature&Consequences" />

A long-term study of adults retrospectively reporting adverse childhood experiences including verbal, physical and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of childhood trauma found 25.9% of adults reported verbal abuse as children, 14.8% reported physical abuse, and 12.2% reported sexual abuse. Data from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) and [[Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System]] corroborate these high rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5949a1.htm|title=Adverse Childhood Experiences Reported by Adults --- Five States, 2009|access-date=5 March 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311085117/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5949a1.htm|archive-date=11 March 2015}}</ref> There is a high correlation between the number of different adverse childhood experiences (A.C.E.s) and risk for poor health outcomes in adults including cancer, heart attack, mental illness, reduced longevity drug and alcohol abuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ace/|title=Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study -Child Maltreatment-Violence Prevention-Injury Center-CDC|access-date=5 March 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519000630/http://www.cdc.gov/ace/|archive-date=19 May 2014|date=12 December 2017}}</ref> An anonymous self-reporting survey of Washington State students finds 6–7% of 8th, 10th and 12th grade students actually attempt suicide.

It has been discovered that childhood abuse can lead to the [[addiction]] of drugs and alcohol in adolescence and adult life. Studies show that any type of abuse experienced in childhood can cause neurological changes making an individual more prone to addictive tendencies. A significant study examined 900 court cases of children who had experienced sexual and physical abuse along with neglect. The study found that a large sum of the children who were abused are now currently addicted to alcohol. This case study outlines how addiction is a significant effect of childhood abuse.<ref name="Enoch 2011">{{cite journal|last1=Enoch|first1=Marry-Anne|title=The role of early life stress as a predictor for alcohol and drug dependence|journal=Psychopharmacology|date=2011|pages=17–31|pmid=20596857|doi=10.1007/s00213-010-1916-6|pmc=3005022|volume=214|issue=1}}</ref>

In the case of 23 of the 27 illnesses listed in the questionnaire of a French [[INSEE]] survey, some statistically significant correlations were found between repeated illness and family traumas encountered by the child before the age of 18 years. According to [[Georges Menahem]], the French sociologist who found out these correlations by studying health inequalities, these relationships show that inequalities in illness and suffering are not only social. [[Health inequality]] also has its origins in the family, where it is associated with the degrees of lasting affective problems (lack of affection, parental discord, the prolonged absence of a parent, or a serious illness affecting either the mother or father) that individuals report having experienced in childhood.<ref>"Study of Living Conditions 1986–1987" INSEE survey with a sample of 13–154 individuals, cf.

Many children who have been abused in any form develop some sort of psychological problem. These problems may include: anxiety, depression, eating disorders, OCD, [[co-dependency]], or even a lack of human connections. There is also a slight tendency for children who have been abused to become child abusers themselves. In the U.S. in 2013, of the 294,000 reported child abuse cases only 81,124 received any sort of counseling or therapy. Treatment is greatly important for abused children.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Statistics on Child Abuse|url=http://www.nationalchildrensalliance.org/NCANationalStatistics|work=National Children's Alliance|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502000557/http://www.nationalchildrensalliance.org/NCANationalStatistics|archive-date=2 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On the other hand, there are some children who are raised in child abuse, but who manage to do unexpectedly well later in life regarding the preconditions.

==Causes==
Child abuse is a complex phenomenon with multiple causes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fontana VJ |title=The maltreatment syndrome of children |journal=Pediatric Annals |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=736–44 |date=October 1984 |pmid=6504584}}</ref> No single factor can be identified as to why some adults behave abusively or neglectfully toward children. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the [[International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect]] (ISPCAN) identify multiple factors at the level of the individual, their relationships, their local community, and their society at large, that combine to influence the occurrence of child maltreatment. At the individual level, such factors include age, sex, and personal history, while at the level of society, factors contributing to child maltreatment include cultural norms encouraging harsh physical punishment of children, [[economic inequality]], and the lack of [[social safety net]]s.<ref name="Nature&Consequences" /> WHO and ISPCAN state that understanding the complex interplay of various risk factors is vital for dealing with the problem of child maltreatment.<ref name="Nature&Consequences" />

The American psychoanalyst [[Elisabeth Young-Bruehl]] maintains that harm to children is justified and made acceptable by widely held beliefs in children's inherent subservience to adults, resulting in a largely unacknowledged prejudice against children she terms ''childism''. She contends that such prejudice, while not the immediate cause of child maltreatment, must be investigated in order to understand the motivations behind a given act of abuse, as well as to shed light on societal failures to support children's needs and development in general.<ref name=Childism>{{cite book |author=Young-Bruehl, Elisabeth |date=2012 |title=Childism: Confronting Prejudice Against Children |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-17311-6}}</ref>{{rp|4&ndash;6}}  Founding editor of the ''International Journal of Children's Rights'', Michael Freeman, also argues that the ultimate causes of child abuse lie in prejudice against children, especially the view that human rights do not apply equally to adults and children. He writes, "the roots of child abuse lie not in parental psycho-pathology or in socio-environmental stress (though their influences cannot be discounted) but in a sick culture which denigrates and depersonalizes, which reduces children to property, to sexual objects so that they become the legitimate victims of both adult violence and lust".<ref>{{cite book |author=Freeman, Michael |title=The Moral Status of Children: Essays on the Rights of the Child |date=1997 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location=Netherlands |isbn=978-9041103772 |page=76 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOGZgSgcDRYC |chapter=Beyond conventions{{mdash}}towards empowerment |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113081307/https://books.google.com/books?id=BOGZgSgcDRYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date=13 January 2016  }}</ref>

In these countries, respectively, 33%, 42%, 18% and 43% of children reported at least one type of child abuse.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sebre S, Sprugevica I, Novotni A, Bonevski D, Pakalniskiene V, Popescu D, Turchina T, Friedrich W, Lewis O|title=Cross-cultural comparisons of child-reported emotional and physical abuse: Rates, risk factors and psychosocial symptoms |journal=Child Abuse & Neglect, the International Journal |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=113–127 |year=2004 |pmid=15019442 |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2003.06.004|title-link=psychosocial }}</ref> According to their findings, there was a series of correlations between the potential risk factors of parental employment status, [[alcohol abuse]], and family size within the abuse ratings.<ref name="Sebre, S. 2004">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sebre S, Sprugevica I, Novotni A, Bonevski D, Pakalniskiene V, Popescu D, Turchina T, Friedrich W, Lewis O|title=Cross-cultural comparisons of child-reported emotional and physical abuse: Rates, risk factors and psychosocial symptoms |journal=Child Abuse & Neglect, the International Journal |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=113–127 |year=2004 |pmid=15019442 |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2003.06.004}}</ref> In three of the four countries, parental substance abuse was considerably correlated with the presence of child abuse, and although it was a lower percentage, still showed a relationship in the fourth country (Moldova).<ref name="Sebre, S. 2004" /> Each country also showed a connection between the father not working outside of the home and either emotional or physical child abuse.<ref name="Sebre, S. 2004" /> After the fall of the communism regime, some positive changes have followed with regard to tackling child abuse. While there is a new openness and acceptance regarding [[parenting styles]] and close relationships with children, child abuse has certainly not ceased to exist. While controlling parenting may be less of a concern, financial difficulty, [[unemployment]], and substance abuse still remain dominating factors in child abuse throughout Eastern Europe.<ref name="Sebre, S. 2004" />

These cultural differences can be studied from many perspectives. Most importantly, overall parental behavior is genuinely different in various countries. Each culture has their own "range of acceptability," and what one may view as offensive, others may seem as tolerable. Behaviors that are normal to some may be viewed as abusive to others, all depending on the [[societal norms]] of that particular country.<ref name="Sebre, S. 2004" />

Asian parenting perspectives hold different ideals from [[American culture]]. Many have described their traditions as including physical and emotional closeness that ensures a lifelong [[traumatic bonding|bond]] between parent and child, as well as establishing parental authority and child obedience through harsh [[discipline]].<ref name="Lau, A. S. 2006">Lau, A. S., Takeuchi, D. T., & Alegría, M. (2006). Parent-to-child aggression among Asian American parents: Culture, context, and vulnerability.

Retrieved</ref> Balancing disciplinary responsibilities within parenting is common in many Asian cultures, including China, Japan, Singapore, Vietnam and Korea.<ref name="Lau, A. S. 2006" /> To some cultures, forceful parenting may be seen as abuse, but in other societies such as these, the use of force is looked at as a reflection of parental devotion.<ref name="Lau, A. S. 2006" />

The differences in these cultural beliefs demonstrate the importance of examining all [[cross-cultural]] perspectives when studying the concept of child abuse.

==Disclosure and assessment==
Suspicion for physical abuse is recommended when an injury occurs in a child who does not yet move independently, injuries are in unusual areas, more than one injury at different stages of healing, symptoms of possible head trauma, and injuries to more than one [[body system]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Christian|first1=C. W.|title=The Evaluation of Suspected Child Physical Abuse|journal=Pediatrics|date=27 April 2015|volume=135|issue=5|pages=e1337–e1354|doi=10.1542/peds.2015-0356|pmid=25917988}}</ref>

In many jurisdictions, abuse that is suspected, not necessarily proven, requires reporting to [[child protection]] agencies, such as the [[Child Protection Services]] in the United States. Recommendations for healthcare workers, such as [[primary care provider]]s and [[nurse]]s, who are often suited to encounter suspected abuse are advised to firstly determine the child’s immediate need for safety. A private environment away from suspected abusers is desired for interviewing and examining. Leading statements that can distort the story are avoided. As disclosing abuse can be distressing and sometimes even shameful, reassuring the child that he or she has done the right thing by telling and that they are not bad or that the abuse was not their fault helps in disclosing more information. [[Anatomically correct doll|Dolls]] are sometimes used to help explain what happened. In Mexico, psychologists trial using cartoons to speak to children who may be more likely to disclose information than to a adult stranger.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kenny|first=Richard|date=25 July 2017|title=Cartoon alien helps children in Mexico deal with trauma|work=BBC News|type=Video|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-40708314/cartoon-alien-helps-children-in-mexico-deal-with-trauma|access-date=27 July 2020}}</ref> For the suspected abusers, it is also recommended to use a nonjudgmental, nonthreatening attitude towards them and to withhold expressing shock, in order to help disclose information.<ref>Wilson, S.F.W, Giddens, J.F.G. (2009) Health Assessment for Nursing Practice. St.Louis: Mosby Elsevier, page 506.</ref>

A key part of child abuse work is assessment. A few methods of assessment include projective tests, clinical interviews, and behavioral observations.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} 
*Projective tests allow for the child to express themselves through drawings, stories, or even descriptions in order to get help establish an initial understanding of the abuse that took place
* Clinical interviews are comprehensive interviews performed by professionals to analyze the mental state of the one being interviewed
*Behavioral observation gives an insight into things that trigger a child's memory of the abuse through observation of the child's behavior when interacting with other adults or children

A particular challenge arises where child protection professionals are assessing families where neglect is occurring. Professionals conducting assessments of families where neglect is taking place can make the following errors:<ref>Williams, M.

* Failure to ask the right types of question, including
** Whether neglect is occurring;
** Why neglect is occurring;
** What the situation is like for the child;
** Whether improvements in the family are likely to be sustained;
** What needs to be done to ensure the long-term safety of the child?

==Prevention==
A support-group structure is needed to reinforce parenting skills and closely monitor the child's well-being. Visiting home nurse or social-worker visits are also required to observe and evaluate the progress of the child and the caretaking situation. The support-group structure and visiting home nurse or social-worker visits are not mutually exclusive. Many studies have demonstrated that the two measures must be coupled together for the best possible outcome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/child_abuse/page8.htm#how_can_child_abuse_be_prevented|title=Child Abuse Symptoms, Causes, Treatment – How can child abuse be prevented? on MedicineNet|publisher=Medicinenet.com|access-date=24 December 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221061631/http://www.medicinenet.com/child_abuse/page8.htm#how_can_child_abuse_be_prevented|archive-date=21 December 2012}}</ref>

Children's school programs regarding "good touch … bad touch" can provide children with a forum in which to role-play and learn to avoid potentially harmful scenarios.

This would aid the individual in becoming less fearful of specific stimuli that would arouse debilitating fear, anger, sadness or other negative emotion. In other words, the individual would have some control or mastery over those emotions.<ref name="Golden, J.A. 2009" />

Parenting training can prevent child abuse in the short term, and help children with a range of emotional, conduct and behavioural challenges, but there is insufficient evidence about whether it treat parents who already abuse their children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalelfservice.net/populations-and-settings/parenting/parent-training-works-for-child-and-adolescent-mental-health/|title=Parent training works for child and adolescent mental health|date=19 January 2017}}</ref>

Abuse-focused [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] was designed for children who have experienced physical abuse. It targets externalizing behaviors and strengthens prosocial behaviors.

Rational Cognitive Emotive Behavior Therapy consists of ten distinct but interdependent steps. These steps fall into one of three theoretical orientations (i.e., rational or solution focused, cognitive emotive, and behavioral) and are intended to provide abused children and their adoptive parents with positive behavior change, corrective interpersonal skills, and greater control over themselves and their relationships. They are: 1) determining and normalizing thinking and behaving, 2) evaluating language, 3) shifting attention away from problem talk 4) describing times when the attachment problem isn't happening, 5) focusing on how family members "successfully" solve problematic attachment behavior; 6) acknowledging "unpleasant emotions" (i.e., angry, sad, scared) underlying negative interactional patterns, 7) identifying antecedents (controlling conditions) and associated negative cognitive emotive connections in behavior (reciprocal role of thought and emotion in behavioral causation), 8) encouraging previously abused children to experience or "own" negative thoughts and associated aversive emotional feelings, 9) modeling and rewarding positive behavior change (with themselves and in relationships), and 10) encouraging and rewarding thinking and behaving differently. This type of therapy shifts victims thoughts away from the bad and changes their behavior.<ref name="Golden, J.A. 2009" />

[[Parent–child interaction therapy]] was designed to improve the child-parent relationship following the experience of domestic violence. It targets trauma-related symptoms in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, including PTSD, aggression, defiance, and anxiety. It is supported by two studies of one sample.<ref name=Cohen2006 />

School-based programs have also been developed to treat children who are survivors of abuse.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Kerryann|date=April 16, 2015|title=School‐based education programmes for the prevention of child sexual abuse|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|url=https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004380.pub3/full?highlightAbstract=abus%7Cabuse%7Cchildren%7Cchild|issue=4|pages=CD004380|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004380.pub3|pmid=25876919}}</ref> This approach teaches children, parents, teachers, and other school staff how to identify the signs of child maltreatment as well as skills that can be helpful in preventing child maltreatment.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Child Welfare Information Gateway|first=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|date=2003|title=School-Based Child Maltreatment Programs|url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/schoolbased.pdf}}</ref> 

Other forms of treatment include group therapy, play therapy, and  art therapy. Each of these types of treatment can be used to better assist the client, depending on the form of abuse they have experienced. Play therapy and art therapy are ways to get children more comfortable with therapy by working on something that they enjoy (coloring, drawing, painting, etc.). The design of a child's artwork can be a symbolic representation of what they are feeling, relationships with friends or family, and more. Being able to discuss and analyze a child's artwork can allow a professional to get a better insight of the child.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schechter DS, Zygmunt A, Trabka KA, Davies M, Colon E, Kolodji A, McCaw JE | title = Child mental representations of attachment when mothers are traumatized: The relationship of family-drawings to story-stem completion | journal = Journal of Early Childhood and Infant Psychology | volume = 3 | pages = 119–141 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18347736 | pmc = 2268110 }}</ref>

==Prevalence==
Child abuse is complex and difficult to study. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), estimates of the rates of child maltreatment vary widely by country, depending on how child maltreatment is defined, the type of maltreatment studied, the scope and quality of data gathered, and the scope and quality of surveys that ask for self-reports from victims, parents, and caregivers. Despite these limitations, international studies show that a quarter of all adults report experiencing physical abuse as children, and that 1 in 5 women and 1 in 13 men report experiencing childhood sexual abuse. Emotional abuse and neglect are also common childhood experiences.<ref name=WHOFact>{{cite web |title=Child maltreatment: Fact sheet No. 150 |date=December 2014 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs150/en/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717165627/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs150/en/ |archive-date=17 July 2015  }}</ref>

{{as of|2014}}, an estimated 41,000 children under 15 are victims of [[homicide]] each year. The WHO states that this number underestimates the true extent of [[child homicide]]; a significant proportion of child deaths caused by maltreatment are incorrectly attributed to unrelated factors such as falls, burns, and drowning. Also, girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, exploitation and abuse in situations of [[armed conflict]] and [[refugee]] settings, whether by combatants, security forces, community members, aid workers, or others.<ref name=WHOFact />

The [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] wrote in 1993 that "...the available evidence suggests that child abuse and neglect is an important, prevalent problem in the United States [...] Child abuse and neglect are particularly  important compared with other critical childhood problems because they are often directly associated with adverse physical and mental health consequences in children and families".<ref name=NRC1993>{{cite book |author=Panel on Research on Child Abuse and Neglect; Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, National Research Council |title=Understanding Child Abuse and Neglect |date=1993 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Academy Press |url=http://www.nap.edu/read/2117/chapter/1 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324085817/http://www.nap.edu/read/2117/chapter/1 |archive-date=24 March 2016  |doi=10.17226/2117 |isbn=978-0-309-04889-7 }}</ref>{{rp|6}}

In 2012, [[Child Protective Services]] (CPS) agencies estimated that about 9 out of 1000 children in the United States were victims of child maltreatment. Most (78%) were victims of neglect. Physical abuse, sexual abuse, and other types of maltreatment, were less common, making up 18%, 9%, and 11% of cases, respectively ("other types" included emotional abuse, parental substance abuse, and inadequate supervision). According to data reported by the Children’s Bureau of the US Department of Health and Human Services,  more than 3.5 million allegations of child abuse were looked into by child protective services who in turn confirmed 674,000 of those cases in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020|title=Child Abuse|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/PC3010999343/OVIC?sid=OVIC&xid=35ee811a.|access-date=2020-06-11|website=Opposing Viewpoints Online Collection|publisher=Gale|location=Farmington Hills, Michigan}}</ref>  However, CPS reports may underestimate the true scope of child maltreatment. A non-CPS study estimated that one in four children experience some form of maltreatment in their lifetimes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<ref name=CDCFact2014>{{cite web |title=Child Maltreatment: Facts at a Glance |location=Atlanta, GA |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=2014 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/childmaltreatment-facts-at-a-glance.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829054942/https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/childmaltreatment-facts-at-a-glance.pdf |archive-date=29 August 2017  }}</ref>

According to [[David Finkelhor]] who tracked Child Maltreatment Report (NCANDS) data from 1990 to 2010, sexual abuse had declined 62% from 1992 to 2009 and the long-term trend for physical abuse was also down by 56% since 1992.  He stated: "It is unfortunate that information about the trends in child maltreatment are not better publicized and more widely known.

A child abuse fatality occurs when a child's death is the result of abuse or neglect, or when abuse or neglect are contributing factors to a child's death. In the United States, 1,730 children died in 2008 due to factors related to abuse; this is a rate of 2 per 100,000 U.S. children.<ref>[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cm08/cm08.pdf Child Maltreatment 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705035918/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cm08/cm08.pdf |date=5 July 2010 }}, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, p.&nbsp;55.</ref> Family situations which place children at risk include moving, unemployment, and having non-family members living in the household.

During the [[One Child Policy]] in China, women were only allowed to have one child. Local governments would allow the woman to give birth and then they would take the baby away stating the mother violated the one child policy. Child traffickers, often paid by the government, would sell the children to orphanages that would arrange international adoptions worth tens of thousands of dollars, turning a profit for the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdkHA_-xryk|title='One Child Nation' Exposes the Tragic Consequences of Chinese Population Control|work=[[Reason TV]]|date=2019-08-16}}</ref>

Most of the children living in institutions around the world have a surviving parent or close relative, and they most commonly entered orphanages because of poverty. It is speculated that, flush with money, orphanages are increasing and push for children to join even though demographic data show that even the poorest extended families usually take in children whose parents have died. Experts and child advocates maintain that orphanages are expensive and often harm children's [[child development|development]] by separating them from their families and that it would be more effective and cheaper to aid close relatives who want to take in the orphans.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/world/africa/06orphans.html Aid gives alternatives to African orphanages]</ref>

{{Main|Child marriage}}
A child marriage is a marriage in which one or both participants are minors, often before the age of [[puberty]]. Child marriages are common in many parts of the world, especially in parts of Asia and Africa.  The United Nations considers those below the age of 18 years to be incapable of giving valid consent to marriage and therefore regards such marriages as a form of [[forced marriage]]; and that marriages under the age of majority have significant potential to constitute a form of child abuse.<ref name=UNWomen>{{cite web|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/614-definition-of-forced-and-child-marriage.html|title=Definition of forced and child marriage|publisher=United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women|access-date=5 March 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315070017/http://endvawnow.org/en/articles/614-definition-of-forced-and-child-marriage.html|archive-date=15 March 2015}}</ref> In many countries, such practices are lawful or — even where laws prohibit child marriage — often unenforced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Forced and early marriage: a focus on central and eastern Europe and former Soviet Union countries with selected laws from other countries|author=Thomas, Cheryl|date=19 June 2009|publisher=United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women; United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw_legislation_2009/Expert%20Paper%20EGMGPLHP%20_Cheryl%20Thomas%20revised_.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704111936/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw_legislation_2009/Expert%20Paper%20EGMGPLHP%20_Cheryl%20Thomas%20revised_.pdf|archive-date=4 July 2015}}</ref> [[Child marriage in India|India has more child brides]] than any other nation, with 40% of the world total.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://world.time.com/2013/10/14/india-criticized-for-not-co-sponsoring-u-n-child-bride-resolution/|author=Bhowmick, Nilanjana|title=India Criticized for Not Co-Sponsoring U.N.

[[Bride kidnapping]], also known as marriage by abduction or marriage by capture, has been practiced around the world and throughout history, and sometimes involves minors.

Child abuse also poses ethical concerns related to [[confidentiality]], as victims may be physically or psychologically unable to report abuse to authorities. Accordingly, many jurisdictions and professional bodies have made exceptions to standard requirements for confidentiality and [[Privilege (evidence)|legal privileges]] in instances of child abuse. Medical professionals, including doctors, therapists, and other mental health workers typically owe a duty of confidentiality to their patients and clients, either by law or the standards of [[professional ethics]], and cannot disclose personal information without the [[consent]] of the individual concerned. This duty conflicts with an ethical obligation to protect children from preventable harm. Accordingly, confidentiality is often waived when these professionals have a good faith suspicion that child abuse or neglect has occurred or is likely to occur and make a report to local [[child protection]] authorities. This exception allows professionals to breach confidentiality and make a report even when children or their parents or guardians have specifically instructed to the contrary. Child abuse is also a common exception to [[physician–patient privilege]]: a medical professional may be called upon to testify in court as to otherwise privileged evidence about suspected child abuse despite the wishes of children or their families.<ref name="confidentiality">{{cite web|last=National Center for Youth Law |title=Minor Consent, Confidentiality, and Child Abuse Reporting |url=http://www.youthlaw.org/publications/minor_consent/ |access-date=29 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215152122/http://www.youthlaw.org/publications/minor_consent |archive-date=15 December 2010  }}</ref> Some child abuse policies in Western countries have been criticized both by some conservatives, who claim such policies unduly interfere in the privacy of the family, and by some feminists of the left wing, who claim such policies disproportionally target and punish disadvantaged women who are often themselves in vulnerable positions.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/3555098 |title=Marxist and feminist critiques of child protection: To protect children or to change society? |journal=Children Australia |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=27–31 |access-date=24 August 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106031622/http://www.academia.edu/3555098/Marxist_and_Feminist_critiques_of_Child_Protection_To_Protect_Children_or_to_Change_Society_By_Philip_Mendes_published_in_Children_Australia_24_2_1999_27-31 |archive-date=6 November 2017  |last1=Mendes |first1=Philip |doi=10.1017/S103507720000910X |year=1999 }}</ref> There has also been concern that ethnic minority families are disproportionally targeted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/role-drugs-child-removal-cases-new-jersey/|title=When Race and Drugs Intersect, Children More Likely to Enter Foster Care}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/a-lost-tribe-child-welfare-system-accused-of-repeating-residential-school-history-sapping-aboriginal-kids-from-their-homes|title='A lost tribe': Child welfare system accused of repeating residential school history|date=15 December 2014}}</ref>

As of 2020, Germany and the Netherlands are 2 out of all 27 [[European Union|EU]] countries that do not have any reporting obligations for civilians or professionals. There is no [[mandatory reporting]] law, which would grant reporters of child abuse anonymity and immunity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_8/__8a.html |title=§ 8a SGB 8 - Einzelnorm |date=n.d. |website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de |access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

===US===
In the 1960s [[mandatory reporting in the United States]] was introduced.<ref name="AIFS submission">{{cite document |title = Australian Institute of Family Studies Submission to the Special Commission of Inquiry into Child Protection Services in NSW|publisher = National Child Protection Clearinghouse|last1 = Bromfield|first1 = Leah|last2 = Holzer|first2 = Prue|citeseerx = 10.1.1.385.2444}}</ref>{{rp|3}}

==Advocacy organizations==
{{third-party|section|date=March 2016}}

===United States of America===
There are organizations at national, state, and county levels in the United States that provide community leadership in preventing child abuse and neglect. The [[National Alliance of Children's Trust Funds]] and [[Prevent Child Abuse America]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://preventchildabuse.org/|title=Prevent Child Abuse America - Because Children are our future...|website=Prevent Child Abuse America}}</ref> are two national organizations with member organizations at the state level.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Many investigations into child abuse are handled on the local level by [[Child Advocacy Centers]]. Started over 25 years ago at what is now known as the [[National Children's Advocacy Center]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalcac.org/index.html|title=SITE OFFLINE|access-date=5 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305124436/http://nationalcac.org/index.html|archive-date=5 March 2016}}</ref> in Huntsville, Alabama by District Attorney Robert "Bud" Cramer these multi-disciplinary teams have met to coordinate their efforts so that cases of child abuse can be investigated quickly and efficiently, ultimately reducing trauma to the child and garnering better convictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalcac.org/professionals/model/cac_model.html |title=National Children's Advocacy Center |access-date=5 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823005235/http://nationalcac.org/professionals/model/cac_model.html |archive-date=23 August 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalcac.org/ncac/history.html |title=History |author=MFI_Michael |access-date=5 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823005150/http://nationalcac.org/ncac/history.html |archive-date=23 August 2011  }}</ref> These Child Advocacy Centers (known as CACs) have standards set by the National Children's Alliance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalchildrensalliance.org/|title=National Children's Alliance – Empowering local communities to serve child victims of abuse|access-date=5 March 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302150224/http://www.nationalchildrensalliance.org/|archive-date=2 March 2015}}</ref>

Other organizations focus on specific prevention strategies. The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome focuses its efforts on the specific issue of preventing child abuse that is manifested as [[shaken baby syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dontshake.org/ |access-date=2020-11-22 |title=National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome|website=dontshake.org}}</ref>

NICHD, also known as the [[National Institute of Child Health & Human Development]] is a broad organization, but helps victims of child abuse through one of its branches. Through the Child Development and Behavior (CDB) Branch, NICHD raises awareness efforts by supporting research projects to better understand the short- and long-term impacts of child abuse and neglect. They provide programs and observe National Child Abuse Prevention Month every April since 1984.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The [[United States Children's Bureau]] leads activities for the Month, including the release of updated statistics about child abuse and neglect, candlelight vigils, and fundraisers to support prevention activities and treatment for victims. The Bureau also sponsors a "Blue Ribbon Campaign," in which people wear blue ribbons in memory of children who have died from abuse, or in honor of individuals and organizations that have taken important steps to prevent child abuse and neglect.<ref>{{cite web|title=Strengthening Families and Communities: National Child Abuse Prevention Month|work=National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)|date=21 December 2011|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/resources/spotlight/041310-strengthening-families-communities.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027110105/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/resources/spotlight/041310-strengthening-families-communities.cfm|archive-date=27 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Canada===
Charitable organizations exist in each province to assist children and families with abuse. While there is no centralized of nationwide organization. Organizations such as the [[Canadian Red Cross]],<ref>https://www.redcross.ca/how-we-help/violence-bullying-and-abuse-prevention/parents/child-abuse</ref> [[Kids Help Phone]],<ref>https://apps.kidshelpphone.ca/resourcesaroundme/welcome.html/</ref> and [[Guardians of the Children Canada]] are able to direct people to locally available resources.
