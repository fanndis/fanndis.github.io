The '''''South China Morning Post''''' ('''''SCMP'''''), with its Sunday edition, the '''''Sunday Morning Post''''', is a [[Hong Kong]]-based English-language [[newspaper]] founded in 1903.

Editor-in-chief Tammy Tam succeeded Wang Xiangwei in 2016. The ''SCMP'' prints paper editions in Hong Kong and operates an online news website.

The newspaper's circulation has been relatively stable for years—the average daily circulation stood at 100,000 in 2016. In a 2019 survey by the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], the ''SCMP'' was regarded as the most credible paid newspaper in Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Centre for Communication and Public Opinion Survey |title=Tracking Research: Public Evaluation on Media Credibility - Survey Results |url=http://www.com.cuhk.edu.hk/ccpos/en/research/Credibility_Survey%20Results_2019_ENG.pdf |publisher=Chinese University of Hong Kong |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=2019}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Anti-Qing revolutionary Tse Tsan-tai and British journalist Alfred Cunningham founded the ''South China Morning Post'' in 1903,<ref name="WangWong2018">{{cite book |last1=Wang |first1=Bess |last2=Wong |first2=Tin Chi |editor1-last=Huang |editor1-first=Yu |editor2-last=Song |editor2-first=Yunya |title=The Evolving Landscape of Media and Communication in Hong Kong |date=2018 |publisher=City University of Hong Kong Press |location=Hong Kong |pages=13–30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2x7DwAAQBAJ |chapter=The Landscape of Newspapers in Hong Kong|isbn=9789629373511 }}</ref>{{rp|25}} publishing its first issue on 6 November 1903. It changed its Chinese name from "{{lang|zh|南清早報}}", which translates as the ''South Qing Morning Post'', to "{{lang|zh|南華早報}}" in 1913, a year after the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] was founded.

The purpose of founding the ''SCMP'' is disputed. The ''SCMP'' has been described as a newspaper founded to support the reform movement in the late-[[Qing Empire]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Prescott |editor1-last=King |editor1-first=Frank H.

Early editorials were mainly written by British journalists, such as Cunningham, Douglas Story and Thomas Petrie, while Tse attracted business to the newspaper.<ref name="Zou2015">{{cite journal |last1=Zou |first1=Yizheng |title=English newspapers in British colonial Hong Kong: the case of the South China Morning Post (1903–1941) |journal=Critical Arts |date=2015 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=26–40 |doi=10.1080/02560046.2015.1009676|s2cid=144697510 }}</ref>{{rp|27}} The editors maintained a good relationship with the Hong Kong government.<ref name="Zou2015"/>{{rp|27}} In 1904, the newspaper's circulation was 300 copies.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hutcheon |first1=Robin |title=S.C.M.P., the first eighty years |date=1983 |publisher=South China Morning Post |isbn=978-962-10-0022-4 |oclc=11444925 |language=English}}</ref>{{rp|71}}

The newspaper faced competition from three English newspapers, ''Hong Kong Daily Press'', ''China Mail'' and the ''Hong Kong Telegraph''.

=== Post-war era ===
After the [[Second World War]], the [[Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] (HSBC) bought majority shares in the newspaper.<ref name="WangWong2018"/>{{rp|25}} It was listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] in November 1971, but was privatised again in 1987 after being bought by the [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] in 1986 for HK$2.2 billion (US$284.4 million).<ref name="Witcher1993">{{cite news |last1=Witcher |first1=S.

Reading the ''SCMP'' has been described as a status symbol in the 20th century, when the newspaper represented the interests of Hong Kong elites and the British government.<ref name="Chan2000">{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=Yuen-ying |authorlink1=Yuen-Ying Chan |title=The English-language media in HongKong |journal=World Englishes |date=2000 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=323–335 |doi=10.1111/1467-971X.00182}}</ref>{{rp|323}} Editors of the ''SCMP'' attended regular meetings at the [[Government House, Hong Kong|Government House]] for disclosures that aimed to influence public opinion and received business briefings from the HSBC.{{r|Chan2000|p=323}}

In September 1993, Murdoch was in negotiations to sell his 50 per cent interest in the ''SCMP'' as part of a scheme to increase the News Corporation's investments in the Asian electronic media industry.<ref name="Goll1993"/> News Corporation then announced that it would sell 34.9 per cent stake — a controlling interest — for US$375 million to Kerry Media owned by Malaysian businessman [[Robert Kuok]].<ref name=20151214ejinsight>{{cite news |last1=Kwok |first1=Ben |title=How the SCMP sale adds up for Kuok and Ma EJINSIGHT - ejinsight.com |url=https://www.ejinsight.com/eji/article/id/1203107/20151214-how-the-scmp-sale-adds-up-for-kuok-and-ma |work=EJInsight |date=14 December 2015|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name="Witcher1993"/>

[[Jonathan Fenby]] served as editor until 1999, when he was replaced by Robert Keatley from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', who became interim editor. Mark Landler of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that under Fenby, the ''SCMP'' was "sharply critical of the Hong Kong government" and that this may have been a factor behind Fenby being replaced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Landler|first=Mark|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/31/world/hong-kong-journal-a-free-spoken-editor-won-t-be-back.html|title=Hong Kong Journal; A Free-Spoken Editor Won't Be Back|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1999-07-31|accessdate=2020-11-21}}</ref> The ''SCMP'' has had 10 editors from 2000 to 2011.<ref name=nextmedia16032020>{{cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20120201/16032020|script-title=zh:隔牆有耳：《南早》赤化 政協做老總|work=Apple Daily |language=zh}}</ref> Mark Clifford, editor-in-chief of ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]'' from 2004 to 2006, was hired as editor-in-chief in February 2006.<ref>{{cite press release |title=SCMP Group Executive Appointment and Changes |work=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong |date=3 February 2006 |accessdate=7 December 2006 |url=http://scmpgroup.com/pressroom/press_20060203.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716015849/http://scmpgroup.com/pressroom/press_20060203.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Clifford brought with him several staffers from ''The Standard'', including business section editor Stuart Jackson, who departed after seven turbulent months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/society/top-editor-forced-to-resign-at-south-china-morning-post/|title=Top Editor Forced to Resign at South China Morning Post|work=Asia Sentinel}}</ref> He presided over the controversial dismissal of several journalists over an internal prank,<ref>{{cite news|title = Subs sacked over leaving page|work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 14 November 2006 | accessdate =21 March 2007 | url = http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,1947667,00.html  | first=Stephen | last=Brook}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title = Two more top editors leave South China Morning Post|work=International Herald Tribune | date = 29 January 2007 | accessdate =21 March 2007 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/29/business/paper.php}}</ref> and himself resigned with effect 1 April 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Editor quits Post after bitter year |work=The Standard |location=Hong Kong |date=20 March 2007 |accessdate=21 March 2007 |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=40537&sid=12738762&con_type=1&d_str=20070320&sear_year=2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522085248/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=40537&sid=12738762&con_type=1&d_str=20070320&sear_year=2007 |archivedate=22 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Following Reginald Chua's short-lived tenure at the Post, from 2009 to April 2011, and deputy editor, Cliff Buddle served as acting editor-in-chief for 10 months.<ref name=ascportfolios>{{cite web|url=http://ascportfolios.org/chinaandmedia/2011/01/16/reginald-chua-editor-in-chief-of-the-south-china-morning-post/|title=Reginald Chua, Editor-in-Chief of the South China Morning Post}}</ref><ref name= marketwired1612986>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/south-china-morning-post-scmp-appoints-veteran-wang-xiangwei-as-new-editor-in-chief-1612986.htm|title=South China Morning Post (SCMP) Appoints Veteran Wang Xiangwei as New Editor-in-Chief|work=Marketwire}}</ref>

=== Alibaba ownership ===
During Alibaba's failed attempt at securing an [[initial public offering]] on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]], the ''SCMP'' published articles questioning the business practices of the platform, including incidents involving counterfeit goods.<ref name=20151213asiasentinel/>

On 11 December 2015, [[Alibaba Group]] announced that it would acquire the media assets of SCMP Group, including ''SCMP'', for HK$2 billion (US$266 million).<ref name=wsj-alibabascmp>{{cite news |last1=Carew |first1=Rick |title=Alibaba to Buy South China Morning Post |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-to-buy-south-china-morning-post-1449840881 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=11 December 2015|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Very Substantial Disposal in Relation to the Media Business and Special Cash Dividend and Termination of Disclosure Transaction |url=https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2015/1214/ltn20151214049.pdf |website=Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing |accessdate=1 May 2020}}</ref>

Alibaba's ownership of ''SCMP'' led to concerns that the newspaper would become a mouthpiece of the [[Central People's Government]]. Among the possible motives of the Alibaba acquisition was to make media coverage of China "fair and accurate" and not in the optic of Western news outlets.<ref name=NYTBuying>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/business/dealbook/alibaba-scmp-south-china-morning-post.html|title=Alibaba Buying South China Morning Post, Aiming to Influence Media|last=Barboza|first=David|date=12 December 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref>  Alibaba said that the newspaper's [[editorial independence]] would be upheld.<ref name=20151211hongkongfp>{{cite news|url=https://hongkongfp.com/2015/12/11/breaking-jack-mas-alibaba-buys-south-china-morning-post-paywall-to-be-scrapped/|title=Breaking: Jack Ma's Alibaba buys South China Morning Post, paywall to be scrapped|work=Hong Kong Free Press|accessdate=1 May 2020|last=Zeng|first=Vivienne}}</ref><ref name=scmp1890058>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1890058/letter-readers-south-china-morning-post-alibabas-executive-vice|title=Letter to readers of the South China Morning Post, from Alibaba's executive vice chairman|date=11 December 2015|work=South China Morning Post}}</ref>

[[Joseph Tsai]], executive vice-chairman of Alibaba Group, said that the fear that Alibaba's ownership would compromise editorial independence "reflects a bias of its own, as if to say newspaper owners must espouse certain views, while those that hold opposing views are 'unfit'. In fact, that is exactly why we think the world needs a plurality of views when it comes to China coverage. China's rise as an economic power and its importance to world stability is too important for there to be a singular thesis."<ref name=scmp1890058/> He also said, "Today when I see mainstream western news organisations cover China, they cover it through a very particular lens. It is through the lens that China is a communist state and everything kind of follows from that. A lot of journalists working with these western media organisations may not agree with the system of governance in China and that taints their view of coverage."<ref name=20151211hongkongfp/>

The acquisition by Alibaba was completed on 5 April 2016.<ref name="auto"/> The ''SCMP'' took down the paywall to its website.<ref name="scmp.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1933763/paywall-down-alibaba-takes-ownership-scmp|title=Paywall down as Alibaba takes ownership of SCMP|publisher=|date=5 April 2016}}</ref>

According to a 2016 public survey conducted by the Centre for Communication and Public Opinion Survey at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], the ''SCMP'' received a credibility rating of 6.54, the highest credibility score among the various paid newspapers in Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite report |author=Chinese University of Hong Kong Centre for Communication and Public Opinion Survey |date=2016 |title=Public Evaluation of Media Credibility: Survey Results |url=http://www.com.cuhk.edu.hk/ccpos/en/research/Credibility_Survey%20Results_2016_ENG.pdf |publisher=Chinese University of Hong Kong|page=2}}</ref>

At present, ''SCMP'' also provides free subscription to "The South China Morning Post iPad edition" for the [[Apple iPad]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The South China Morning Post iPad edition on iTunes Store|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/south-china-morning-post/id382805033?mt=8|work=South China Morning Post|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> SCMP.com launched a major redesign on 20 April 2015.<ref name=20151211hongkongfp/>

Upon having been acquired by Alibaba, the new owners announced that the [[paywall]] would be removed.<ref name=20151211hongkongfp/> The paywall was subsequently removed on the night of 4 April 2016. By doing so, ''SCMP'' wished to increase its readership globally and allow the global community to have access to its news of China. It vowed to better adapt to the reading habits of the readers.<ref name="scmp.com"/> The news site remains blocked in mainland China as of 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nezik |first1=Ann-Kathrin |title=Newspaper Could Help Rebrand China Abroad|url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/south-china-morning-post-rebranding-china-abroad-a-1224273.html |work=Der Spiegel |date=23 August 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

===Editorial stance and staff===
The previous owners of the publication, Kerry Group's Robert Kuok and his family, are claimed to be inclined towards the [[Central People's Government|central government of the People's Republic of China]], and questions were raised over the paper's editorial independence and self-censorship.<ref name="clash"/> The paper's editors nevertheless did assert their independence during Kuok's ownership. There have been concerns, denied by Kuok, over the forced departures, in rapid succession, of several staff and contributors who were considered critical of China's government or its supporters in Hong Kong. These included, in the mid-1990s, cartoonist [[Larry Feign]], humour columnist [[Nury Vittachi]], and numerous China-desk staff, namely 2000–01 editorial pages editor Danny Gittings, Beijing correspondent Jasper Becker and China pages editor [[Willy Wo-Lap Lam|Willy Lam]].<ref name=eroded>[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=11891&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20010702&sear_year=2001 Freedoms eroded to please Beijing: report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218121424/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=11891&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20010702&sear_year=2001 |date=18 February 2008 }}, [[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]], 2 July 2001</ref><ref>Vanessa Gould, Nelson Lee & Bryan Lee, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=10130&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20010228&sear_year=2001 SAR defends rights record] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206124504/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=10130&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20010228&sear_year=2001 |date=6 February 2015 }}, [[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]], 28 February 2001</ref><ref name=apple16032020>[http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20120201/16032020 南早赤化 政協做老總], ''Apple Daily'' {{in lang|zh}}</ref><ref name=20001129renminbao>{{cite web|url=http://www.renminbao.com/rmb/articles/2000/11/29/7214.html|title=新闻特写: 林和立将加盟CNN|work=人民报}}</ref>

Not long after Kuok's purchase of the newspaper, and after running several cartoons about the [[organ harvesting in China|culling of human body parts from Chinese prisoners]], Larry Feign was abruptly dismissed and his satirical comic strip "Lily Wong" axed in 1995. His firing was defended as "cost cutting", but was widely viewed as political self-censorship in the face of the imminent [[handover of Hong Kong]] to the PRC.<ref>Stephen J. Hutcheon, [http://shorensteincenter.org/hong-kongs-media-in-an-era-of-transition/ "Pressing Concerns: Hong Kong's Media in an Era of Transition"]</ref> In his book ''North Wind'', Hong Kong author [[Nury Vittachi]] documented that then editor, [[Jonathan Fenby]], who had joined from ''[[The Observer]]'' of London, suppressed letters querying the disappearance of the popular strip and then busied himself writing letters to international media that had covered the Feign case defending the sacking.<ref name=northwind>''North Wind'', Nury Vittachi, Aberdeen, Hong Kong. Chameleon Press (2001)</ref> Vittachi explained his own departure from the journal in his book, linking it to the pressures he – and other contributors – faced from top management and editors to abstain from writing on topics that were deemed "sensitive", basically in denial of the free speech rights enshrined in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] and the [[one country, two systems]] policy.<ref name=northwind/>

In 2000, Fenby was succeeded by Robert Keatley, a former ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' journalist. After the paper ran a story by [[Willy Wo-Lap Lam|Willy Lam]] on its front page about a delegation of Hong Kong tycoons meeting with Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party [[Jiang Zemin]],<ref name=20151213asiasentinel/> in which it was reported that business opportunities in China were being offered as a quid pro quo for the tycoons' political support, the Chinese Liaison Office raised objections of insensitivity as well as incurring the owner's wrath.<ref name=20151213asiasentinel/> Kuok berated Keatley in his office and wrote a two-page letter, which Keatley published in the letters section of the paper. Kuok stepped down as group chairman that year.<ref name=20151213asiasentinel/>

Editorial page editor Gittings complained that in January 2001 he was told to take a "realistic" view of editorial independence and ordered not to run extracts of the [[Tiananmen Papers]], though ultimately was allowed, after protesting "strenuously", to do so. The editor stated that there had already been sufficient coverage.<ref>Greg Rushford, [http://www.rushfordreport.com/2002/4_2002_Cover.htm Cover Story: Hong Kong at a Crossroads], April 2002</ref>

At the launch of a joint report published by the Hong Kong Journalists' Association and Article 19 in July 2001, the chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists' Association said: "More and more newspapers self-censor themselves because they are controlled by either a businessman with close ties to Beijing, or part of a large enterprise, which has financial interests over the border."<ref name=eroded/>

Editor-in-chief Wang Xiangwei, appointed by the owner in 2012 after consultation with the Liaison Office, was criticised for his decision to reduce the paper's coverage of the [[death of Li Wangyang]] on 7 June 2012.<ref name=20150520sentinel>{{cite news|title=Leading Columnists Purged at Hong Kong's Paper of Record|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/politics/putsch-columnists-south-china-morning-post/|work=Asia Sentinel|date=20 May 2015}}</ref> Wang, who had left the office for the day, reportedly returned to the paper after midnight to reverse the staff editors' decision to run a full story.

Reporter Paul Mooney said that the Li Wangyang story was not an isolated incident: Wang Xiangwei has "long had a reputation as being a censor of the news&hellip;Talk to anyone on the China reporting team at the ''South China Morning Post'' and they'll tell you a story about how Wang has cut their stories, or asked them to do an uninteresting story that was favorable to [mainland] China." Mooney, whose contract with the paper was not renewed in May 2012 reportedly because of budgetary reasons, said he had won more journalism awards than anyone else in the news team, but that for seven months prior to his departure from the newspaper, Wang had marginalised him by blocking him from writing any China stories, and then reportedly hiring several new young reporters, many from mainland China, after he had been ousted.<ref>Paul Mooney, [http://www.isunaffairs.com/?p=8020 Why I was kicked out of the "South China Morning Post"?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703090330/http://www.isunaffairs.com/?p=8020|date=3 July 2012}} ''iSun Affairs'' 28 June 2012</ref>

== Controversies ==

=== Zhao Wei Incident ===
Questions were raised about the relationship between the publication and Chinese authorities after the ''SCMP'' was able to secure an interview with [[Zhao Wei (legal assistant)|Zhao Wei]], the legal assistant of human rights defender [[Li Heping]], who was in the custody of Chinese police.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/south-china-morning-post-china-influence-hong-kong-newspaper-confession|title=Mysterious confession fuels fears of Beijing's influence on Hong Kong's top newspaper|last=Phillips|first=Tom|date=2016-07-25|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-26}}</ref> The ''SCMP'' was able to make contact with Zhao Wei a few days after her release from prison while she was still in the custody of Chinese security forces and at a time when neither her husband nor lawyer were able to reach her. The interview quoted Zhao giving what was taken to be a telephone confession, including “I have come to realise that I have taken the wrong path... I repent for what I did. I'm now a brand new person.”<ref name=":0" />

===Closure of subsidiary publications===
Since the Alibaba acquisition, the ''SCMP'' has discontinued several subsidiary publications, including its Chinese-language edition, the ''48 HOURS'' weekend magazine, and the popular ''[[HK Magazine]]'' alternative weekly. The ''48 HOURS'' staff continue to write on other ''SCMP'' platforms. Zach Hines, former editor-in-chief of ''HK Magazine'' from 2000 to 2015, said that closing the magazine is an effort to shift the focus away from Hong Kong to mainland China and target western readers.<ref name="irreverent">{{cite news|last1=Tsoi|first1=Grace|title=The death of an irreverent Hong Kong magazine|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/37481134|work=BBC News|date=7 October 2016}}</ref>

Zach Hines, who served as editor-in-chief of ''HK Magazine'' from 2008 to 2015, wrote in the ''[[Hong Kong Free Press]]'' of its closure:

<blockquote>"The ''South China Morning Post'' purchased us at the right time, and for sensible reasons. The media landscape was changing dramatically, as it continues to do, and their ownership bought us a few final years of life. But, like “One Country, Two Systems,” this odd and uncomfortable marriage was never going to last.

To be a truly independent press, you cannot be beholden to anyone except your readers. But, to my great dismay, this is becoming an increasing impossibility in Hong Kong, in both the mainstream Chinese and much-smaller English media. SCMP is owned by Alibaba, perhaps the biggest pro-China organization in the world, if you don't count the Communist Party. The paper's business interests are also drifting away from Hong Kong, and toward readers in the United States and the rest of the west. HK Magazine is a canary in the coal mine. [...]

As this sad end to HK Magazine shows, it is clear that it is time now for someone else to step up and provide an alternative voice for Hong Kong. If you care about free speech and the liberal values that make Hong Kong what it is, say something about it. Do something about it. Support independent outlets like ''Hong Kong Free Press'' and [[FactWire]]. You have a voice. Use it. Or you will surely lose it."</blockquote>

Initially SCMP stated that the ''HK Magazine'' website would be deleted from the internet,<ref name="deleted">{{cite news|last1=Grundy|first1=Tom|title=South China Morning Post confirms closure of HK Magazine after 25 years in print – website to be deleted|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/09/28/south-china-morning-post-confirms-closure-of-hk-magazine-after-25-years-last-issue-next-friday/|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]|date=28 September 2016}}</ref> but the move was criticised. The [[Hong Kong Journalists Association]] lodged an inquiry with SCMP management. Hines stated, "It is unthinkable that a newspaper of record would ever consider deleting content from its archive. The SCMP should be held to proper journalistic standards. HK Magazine was an important feature of Hong Kong's media landscape, and it must be preserved. Deleting it would be an utter travesty of journalistic principles – and a slap in the face to SCMP's readers and to Hong Kong society in general."<ref name="hines">{{cite news|last1=Hines|first1=Zach|title=A sad end: HK Magazine was the canary in the coal mine|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/09/30/a-sad-end-hk-magazine-was-the-canary-in-the-coal-mine/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=30 September 2016}}</ref> Following the negative reaction, SCMP stated that ''HK Magazine'' content would be migrated to the ''South China Morning Post'' website before the ''HK Magazine'' website was deleted.<ref name="saved">{{cite news|last1=Grundy|first1=Tom|title=SCMP says HK Magazine online content will be saved|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/09/30/scmp-says-hk-magazine-online-content-will-be-saved/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=30 September 2016}}</ref> Additionally, Hong Kong data scientist Mart van de Ven launched a public appeal to help archive back issues of the magazine, expressing doubt that SCMP would preserve the full archive.<ref name="data">{{cite news|last1=Grundy|first1=Tom|title=Data scientist asks fans to help archive content from soon-to-be-axed HK Magazine|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/10/03/data-scientist-asks-fans-to-help-archive-content-from-soon-to-be-axed-hk-magazine/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=3 October 2016}}</ref> However, he found that he was unable to access issue 1,103, which featured [[Leung Chun-ying]] on the cover.<ref name="data"/>

=== Criticism of Xi Jinping's ally withdrawn===
On 22 July 2017, SCMP published an article ([https://web.archive.org/web/20170718072318/http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2103099/hows-buyer-peninsular-hotels-owner-linked-xi-jinpings-right archived copy]) linking the family member of [[Li Zhanshu]], a close ally of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] [[Xi Jinping]], to a Singaporean investor who has spent HK $4 billion in Hong Kong investment. It cited records at the Hong Kong Company Registration on their associations. The article was published both online and in print. It was removed by midnight and a correction was issued claiming the author used unverifiable claims as the basis of the article. The columnist [[Shirley Yam]] subsequently resigned, noting that she stood by her article.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxun.com/news/gb/china/2017/07/201707191758.shtml#.WXAt1hWGMdU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/07/21/south-china-morning-post-removes-article-linking-chinese-president-xi-jinping-singaporean-investor/|title=South China Morning Post removes article linking Chinese President Xi Jinping to Singaporean investor|last=Grundy|first=Tom|date=2017-07-21|website=Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|access-date=2017-07-21}}</ref>

=== Publication of an interview made under duress ===
In 2018 the ''South China Morning Post'' published an interview with [[Gui Minhai]], who was detained in China at the time. This raised concerns about the interview being fake or scripted, which caused backlash against SCMP. Magnus Fiskesjö, an associate professor at [[Cornell University]] and friend of Gui,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Phillips|first=Tom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/22/how-china-snatched-gui-minhai-train-beijing-bookseller-hong-kong|title='A very scary movie': how China snatched Gui Minhai on the 11.10 train to Beijing|date=2018-02-22|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> commented that:<ref name="Confessions Made in China">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinoiresie.info/confessions-made-in-china/|title=Confessions Made in China|date=3 May 2018|publisher=}}</ref>

<blockquote>(...) the spectacle's producers included not just the usual propaganda arms of the regime (e.g. the Xinhua News Agency, etc.), but also the formerly independent ''South China Morning Post'' (SCMP) of Hong Kong. In agreeing to "interview" a torture victim in between the torture sessions, the paper gave in to pressure from China.</blockquote>

As a result of this incident, Fiskesjö said that "SCMP can no longer be trusted as an independent news organisation."<ref name="Confessions Made in China"/>

Before the acquisition in 2016 by Alibaba, ''South China Morning Post'' belonged to the '''SCMP Group Limited''', a company also involved in property investment and convenience store operation. In April 2016, the company announced that the transaction of their media businesses with Alibaba was completed. As the intellectual property rights to the name "SCMP" was also transferred, the company changed its name to ''Armada Holdings Limited'', then to ''Great Wall Pan Asia Holdings''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.marketing-interactive.com/scmp-group-intends-rename-armada-holdings/|title=SCMP Group intends to rename as Armada Holdings|last=Tam|first=Inti|work=Marketing Interactive|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20160219-scmp-group-renamed-armada-after-selling-newspaper/|title=SCMP Group to be renamed Armada after selling newspaper|date=2016-02-19|work=EJ Insight|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}</ref>
