'''Luther Ronzoni Vandross Jr.''' (April 20, 1951 – July 1, 2005) was an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. Throughout his career, Vandross was an in-demand background vocalist for several different artists including [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Diana Ross]], [[David Bowie]], [[Ben E. King]], and [[Donna Summer]]. He later became a lead singer of the group [[Change (band)|Change]], which released its gold-certified debut album, ''[[The Glow of Love]]'', in 1980 on Warner/RFC Records. After Vandross left the group, he was signed to [[Epic Records]] as a solo artist and released his debut solo album, ''[[Never Too Much (album)|Never Too Much]]'', in 1981.

His hit songs include "[[Never Too Much (song)|Never Too Much]]", "[[Here and Now (Luther Vandross song)|Here and Now]]", "[[Any Love (Luther Vandross song)|Any Love]]", "[[Power of Love/Love Power]]", "[[I Can Make It Better]]" and "[[For You to Love]]". Many of his songs were covers of original music by other artists such as "[[If This World Were Mine]]" (duet with [[Cheryl Lynn]]), "[[Since I Lost My Baby]]", "[[Superstar (Delaney and Bonnie song)|Superstar]]", "[[I (Who Have Nothing)]]" and "[[Always and Forever (Heatwave song)|Always and Forever]]". Duets such as "[[The Closer I Get to You]]" with [[Beyoncé]], "[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]" with [[Mariah Carey]] and "[[The Best Things in Life Are Free]]" with [[Janet Jackson]] were all hit songs in his career.

During his career, Vandross sold over 35 million records worldwide,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Barker|first1=Andrew|title=Luther Vandross Receives Star on Walk of Fame|url=https://variety.com/2014/music/news/luther-vandross-receives-star-on-walk-of-fame-1201208466/|access-date=September 20, 2014|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 3, 2014}}</ref> and received eight [[Grammy Award]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/21620783 |title=Vandross' Funeral Soulful and Powerful |access-date=December 2, 2006 |work=Yahoo!

Before his solo breakthrough, Vandross was part of a singing quintet named Luther in the late 1970s.  The quintet consisted of former Shades of Jade members Anthony Hinton and Diane Sumler, as well as Theresa V. Reed, and [[Christine Wiltshire]], signed to [[Cotillion Records]]. Although the singles "It's Good for the Soul", "Funky Music (Is a Part of Me)",<!-- they were top 40 r&b hits according to Billboard1982 ref --><ref name=Billboard1982/> and "The Second Time Around" were relatively successful, their two albums, the self-titled ''[[Luther (album)|Luther]]'' (1976) and ''[[This Close to You]]'' (1977), which Vandross produced, did not sell enough to make the charts.<!-- possible ref<ref name="GuardianObit"/> --> Vandross bought back the rights to those albums after Cotillion dropped the group, preventing them from being re-released.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Phil|title=Barry may be the walrus of love.

Vandross also wrote and sang commercial [[jingles]] from 1977 until the early 1980s, for companies including [[NBC]], [[Mountain Dew]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Burger King]], and [[Juicy Fruit]].<ref name=JetChristian /><ref name="NewYorkCoombs"/> He continued his successful career as a popular session singer during the late 1970s.  His aforementioned song "Everybody Rejoice", sometimes called "A Brand New Day", was used in a [[Kodak]] commercial during the mid-1970s.

In 1978, Vandross sang lead vocals for Greg Diamond's disco band, Bionic Boogie, on the song titled "Hot Butterfly".<ref name="Spin"/> Also in 1978, he appeared on [[Quincy Jones]]'s ''[[Sounds...and Stuff Like That!!]]'', most notably on the song "I'm Gonna Miss You in the Morning" along with [[Patti Austin]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Neal|first=Mark Anthony|author-link=Mark Anthony Neal|title=Looking for Leroy: Illegible Black Masculinities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKRFmvIVcEIC&pg=PA147|access-date=September 20, 2014|date=April 22, 2013|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8147-6060-4|page=147}}</ref> Vandross also sang with the band Soirée and was the lead vocalist on the track "You Are the Sunshine of My Life"; he also contributed background vocals to the album along with [[Jocelyn Brown]] and [[Sharon Redd]], each of whom also saw solo success.

Vandross also appeared on the group Charme's 1979 album ''Let It In''.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===1980s: ''Change'' and solo breakthrough===
Vandross made his career breakthrough as a featured singer with the vaunted pop-dance act [[Change (band)|Change]], a studio concept created by French-Italian businessman [[Jacques Fred Petrus]]. Their 1980 hits, "The Glow of Love" (by Romani, Malavasi and Garfield) and "Searching" (by Malavasi), featured Vandross as the lead singer. In a 2001 interview with ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'', Vandross said "The Glow of Love" was "the most beautiful song I've ever sung in my life."<ref name=VibeSearching /> Both songs were from Change's debut album, ''[[The Glow of Love]]''.

Vandross was originally intended to perform on their second and highly successful album ''[[Miracles (Change album)|Miracles]]'' in 1981, but declined the offer as Petrus didn't pay enough money. Vandross' decision led to a recording contract with [[Epic Records]] that same year,<ref name=JetChristian/> but he also provided background vocals on "Miracles" and on the new Petrus-created act, the [[B. B. & Q. Band]] in 1981. During that hectic year Vandross jump-started his second attempt at a solo career with his debut album, ''[[Never Too Much (album)|Never Too Much]]''. In addition to the hit title track it contained a version of the [[Dionne Warwick]] song "[[A House Is Not a Home (song)|A House Is Not a Home]]".<ref name=JetChristian/>

The song "[[Never Too Much (song)|Never Too Much]]", written by him, reached number-one on the R&B charts. This period also marked the beginning of songwriting collaboration with bassist [[Marcus Miller]], who played on many of the tracks and would also produce or co-produce a number of tracks for Vandross. The ''Never Too Much'' album was arranged by Vandross' high school classmate, [[Nat Adderley Jr.|Nat Adderley, Jr.]], a collaboration that would last through Vandross' career.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Oshinsky|first1=Matthew|title=Born to swing: Nat Adderley Jr. returns to his roots|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2009/09/born_to_swing_nat_adderley_jr.html|access-date=September 20, 2014|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=September 10, 2009}}</ref>

Vandross released a series of successful R&B albums during the 1980s and continued his session work with guest vocals on groups like Charme in 1982. Many of his earlier albums made a bigger impact on the R&B charts than on the pop charts. During the 1980s, two of Vandross' singles reached No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' R&B charts: "Stop to Love", in 1986, and a duet with [[Gregory Hines]]—"There's Nothing Better Than Love."<ref>.[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=luther vandross|chart=all}} Artist Chart History]</ref> Vandross was at the helm as producer for Aretha Franklin's Gold-certified, award-winning comeback album ''[[Jump to It]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Grien|first1=Paul|title=Arif, Aretha Back on Top; And Now, It's Miller Time|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=September 4, 1982|volume=94|issue=34|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT5|access-date=September 20, 2014|publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc.]]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> He also produced the follow-up album, 1983's ''[[Get It Right (album)|Get It Right]]''.<ref name=JetChristian /><ref>{{cite book|last=Bego|first=Mark|author-link=Mark Bego|title=Aretha Franklin: The Queen of Soul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ErKigdCXUwoC&pg=PA215|date=February 10, 2010|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-7867-5229-4|page=215}}</ref>

In 1983, the opportunity to work with his main musical influence, [[Dionne Warwick]], came about with Vandross producing, writing songs, and singing on ''How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye'', her fourth album for [[Arista Records]].<ref name=JetChristian /><ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Waldron|first1=Clarence|title=Luther Vandross Tells What Inspires Him As Songwriter And Entertainer|magazine=Jet|date=June 17, 1985|volume=68|issue=14|pages=54–55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R7MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54|access-date=September 20, 2014|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|issn=0021-5996}}</ref> The title track duet reached No. 27 on the Hot 100 chart (#7 R&B/#4 [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]]),<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=dionne warwick|chart=all}} Artist Chart History]</ref> while the second single, "Got a Date" was a moderate hit (#45 R&B/#15 Club Play).

Vandross wrote and produced "It's Hard for Me to Say" for [[Diana Ross]] from her ''[[Red Hot Rhythm & Blues]]'' album.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Walters|first1=Barry|title=Diana Ross: Red Hot Rhythm and Blues|magazine=Spin|date=September 1987|volume=3|issue=6|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eDfuEXUHp8C&pg=PA26|access-date=September 20, 2014|publisher=Spin Media LLC|issn=0886-3032}}</ref> Ross performed the song as an a cappella tribute to Oprah Winfrey on her final season of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. She then proceeded to add it to her successful 2010–12 "[[More Today Than Yesterday: The Greatest Hits Tour]]. Vandross also recorded a version of this song on his ''[[Your Secret Love]]'' album in 1996.

In December 1985, Vandross filed a [[Defamation|libel]] suit against a British magazine after it attributed his 85-pound weight loss to [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. He weighed 325 pounds when he started a diet in May that year.<ref name="AP">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Police Say They'll Seek Charge Against Singer in Fatal Crash |url=https://apnews.com/4237232576601135699078fe59231fa6 |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=1986-01-13 |access-date=2014-01-20}}</ref>

In 1985, Vandross first spotted the talent of {{Anchor|Jimmy Salvemini}}Jimmy Salvemini, who was fifteen at the time, on ''[[Star Search]]''. He thought Salvemini had the perfect voice for some of his songs, and contacted him. He was managed by his brother, Larry Salvemini. A contract was negotiated with [[Elektra Records]] for $250,000 and Vandross agreed to produce the album. He contacted his old friends - Cheryl Lynn, Alfa Anderson (Chic), Phoebe Snow and Irene Cara - to appear on the record. After the album was completed, Luther, Jimmy, and Larry decided to celebrate. On January 12, 1986, they were riding in Vandross' 1985 convertible Mercedes-Benz on [[Laurel Canyon Boulevard]], in the north section of [[Hollywood Hills]] in Los Angeles. Luther was driving at 48&nbsp;mph in a 35&nbsp;mph zone when his Mercedes veered across the [[Yellow line (road marking)|double yellow center line]] of the two lane street, turned sideways and collided with the front of a 1972 [[Mercury Marquis]] that was headed southbound, then swung around and hit a 1979 [[Cadillac Seville]] head on.<ref name="AP"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Passenger Dies in Crash of Car Driven by R&B Singer Vandross|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-13/local/me-27701_1_singer-luther-vandross|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=January 20, 2014|date=January 13, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=People in the News|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/People-in-the-News/id-a11e459e36b79d7f7c3271251693c404|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=January 20, 2014|date=January 18, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Luther Vandross Injured in Three-Car Collision; One Passenger Killed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14|magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=69|issue=19|page=14|access-date=January 20, 2014|date=January 27, 1986}}</ref> Vandross and Jimmy were rushed to the [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]].

Vandross faced [[Vehicular homicide|vehicular manslaughter]] charges as a result of Larry's death, and his driving license was suspended for a year. There was no evidence Vandross was under the influence of alcohol or other [[drug]]s; he pleaded no contest to reckless driving.
