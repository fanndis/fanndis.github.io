The school has 19,000 living alumni.<ref name=about/> Amongst its alumni are [[U.S. Supreme Court Justice]] and [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Tom C. Clark]]; [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[James A. Baker]]; [[U.S. Secretary of Treasury]] [[Lloyd Bentsen]]; [[White House]] Senior Advisor [[Paul Begala]]; [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives]] [[Sam Rayburn]]; litigator [[Sarah Weddington]] who represented [[Jane Roe]] in the seminal case [[Roe v Wade]]; [[Wallace B. Jefferson]], the first African American Chief Justice of the [[Texas Supreme Court]]; [[United States Permanent Representative to NATO]] [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]]; statesman [[Robert S. Strauss]]; and [[Gustavo C. Garcia]], [[Carlos Cadena]], [[James DeAnda]], lead litigators for the landmark civil rights case [[Hernandez v. Texas]].

==History==
The University of Texas School of Law was founded in 1883.<ref name=about/> Prior to the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the school was limited to white students, but the school's admissions policies were challenged from two different directions in high-profile 20th century federal court cases that were important to the long struggle over segregation, integration, and diversity in American education.

===''Sweatt v. Painter'' (1950)===
{{Main|Sweatt v. Painter}}

[[File:University of Texas Law Building postcard (1908–1924).jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Law Building on a postcard (1908–1924).]]
The school was sued in the civil rights case of ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'' (1950). The case involved [[Heman Marion Sweatt]], a black man who was refused admission to the School of Law on the grounds that substantially equivalent facilities (meeting the requirements of ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'') were offered by the state's law school for blacks. When the plaintiff first applied to the University of Texas, there was no law school in Texas which admitted blacks. Instead of granting the plaintiff a [[writ]] of [[mandamus]], the Texas trial court "[[Continuance|continued]]" the case for six months to allow the state time to create a law school for blacks, which it developed in Houston.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] reversed the lower court decision, saying that the separate school failed to offer Sweatt an equal legal education. The Court noted that the University of Texas School of Law had 16 full-time and three part-time professors, 850 students and a [[law library]] of 65,000 [[Volume (bibliography)|volumes]], while the separate school the state set up for blacks had five full-time professors, 23 students and a library of 16,500 volumes. But the Court held that even "more important" than these quantitative differences were differences such as "reputation of the faculty, experience of the administration, position and influence of the alumni, standing in the community, traditions and prestige." Because the separate school could not provide an "equal" education, the Court ordered that Hemann Sweatt be admitted to University of Texas School of Law.

''Sweatt v. Painter'' was the first major [[test case]] in the long-term litigation strategy of [[Thurgood Marshall]] and the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|NAACP Legal Defense Fund]] that led to the landmark Supreme Court decision in the case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' in 1954.<ref>Julius L. Chambers, "A Tribute to Justice Thurgood Marshall," Stanford Law Review, Vol. 44, Summer, 1992, p. 1249</ref> Marshall and the NAACP correctly calculated that they could dismantle segregation by building up a series of precedents, beginning at Texas Law, before moving on to the more explosive question of racial integration in elementary schools.

===''Hopwood v. Texas'' (1996)===
{{Main|Hopwood v. Texas}}

In 1992, [[plaintiff]] Cheryl Hopwood, a [[White American]] woman, sued the School of Law on the grounds that she had not been admitted even though her grades and test scores were better than those of some minority candidates who were admitted pursuant to an [[affirmative action]] program. ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' editor Paul Burka later described Hopwood as "the perfect plaintiff to question the fairness of reverse discrimination" because of her academic credentials and personal hardships which she had endured (including a young daughter suffering from a muscular disease).<ref>Burka, Paul. "Law – Cheryl Hopwood." ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' (Sept. 1996)</ref>

With her attorney [[Steven Wayne Smith]], later a two-year member of the [[Texas Supreme Court]], Hopwood won her case, ''[[Hopwood v. Texas]]'', in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], which ruled that the school "may not use race as a factor in deciding which applicants to admit in order to achieve a diverse student body, to combat the perceived effects of a hostile environment at the law school, to alleviate the law school's poor reputation in the minority community, or to eliminate any present effects of past discrimination by actors other than the law school."<ref>Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir. 1996)</ref> The case did not reach the Supreme Court.

However, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'' (2003), a case involving the [[University of Michigan]], that the [[United States Constitution]] "does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body." This effectively reversed the decision of ''Hopwood v. Texas''.<ref>See Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003) (stating that the Supreme Court's purpose in deciding Grutter's case was "to resolve the disagreement among the Courts of Appeals on a question of national importance: Whether diversity is a compelling interest that can justify the narrowly tailored use of race in selecting applicants for admission to public universities. Compare Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932 (CA5 1996) (holding that diversity is not a compelling state interest) with [another case] holding that it is.")</ref>

==Admissions==
