'''''Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr.''''' is a [[documentary television series]] hosted by [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] that premiered on March 25, 2012 on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. In each episode, celebrities are presented with a "book of life" that is compiled with information researched by professional genealogists that allows them to view their ancestral histories, learn about familial connections and discover secrets about their lineage.

Season Six is shown from October 2019 to October 2020 with two new episodes airing weekly in October 2019, eight episodes airing weekly in January and February 2020 and six episodes airing weekly in October and November 2020. All episodes air on Tuesdays.<ref name="season6">{{cite web|title=Season Six of "Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr." Premieres Fall 2019 and Airs Through Fall 2020 on PBS, Beginning October 8|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/07/29/season-six-of-finding-your-roots-with-henry-louis-gates-jr-premieres-fall-2019-and-airs-through-fall-2020-on-pbs-beginning-october-8-45213/20190729pbs08/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=July 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.pbs.org/weta/finding-your-roots/watch/tv-schedule</ref>

==Premise==
The series uses traditional genealogical research and genetics to discover the family history of well-known Americans. Genetic techniques include [[Y-DNA|Y-chromosome DNA]], [[mitochondrial DNA]], and [[Genealogical DNA test#Geographic origin tests|autosomal DNA]] analyses to infer both ancient and recent genetic relationships. The series has examined the family histories of celebrity guests with [[African American]], [[Asian American]], [[British American]], [[Chinese American]], [[Dutch American]], [[Greek American]], [[Indian American]], [[Irish American]], [[Italian American]], [[Jewish American]], and [[Latin American]] heritage.

Each celebrity guest is given a ''book of life'' which contains all the information discovered about the guest's genealogy by researchers. Included in or within the book are comprehensive genetic results, a family tree that is as complete as paper research allows, copies of historical records used to assemble each tree, and photos of newly found family members. In some episodes, particularly episodes in which original [[DNA profiling]] research must be used to establish a past ancestor's parental link, guests are reunited with long-lost relatives. However, in most episodes, each guest is predominantly shown seated opposite Gates as he guides them through their ''book of life''. To show correlations between the guests' family stories, each episode cuts back and forth between two or three guest stories. To draw further correlations, Gates uses examples from his own genealogy quite frequently. Examples of this would be a grandmother of his having multiple children with a [[Light skin|white]] man whose name she never revealed, as well as Gates' membership into the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].

In addition to celebrity guests, everyday people are sometimes featured in an episode to create a third or fourth story line. Usually the non-celebrity guests are a group of peers. One example of this would be the episode in which Gates has his friends at his local barbershop take a DNA test to determine their ethnic makeup, each friend betting on their percentages of [[Ethnic groups in Africa|African]], [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] genetic heritage. Another episode uses a similar guessing game with students at a local school. Singular secondary guests include [[Robert Downey Sr.]] and Margarett Cooper, the latter being a friend of Gates'.<ref name=fyrtwo>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/finding-your-roots/episodes/|title=Finding Your Roots&nbsp;– Episodes|work=[[PBS]]|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref>

===Background===
The series has seen two past incarnations on PBS, both of which were hosted by Henry Louis Gates Jr. In 2006 and 2008, the series ''[[African American Lives]]'' aired. Both seasons of the series consisted of a season-long story line as well as an all [[African American]] cast. In 2010 ''[[Faces of America]]'' aired. Though it continued to use the season-long plot from the prior installment, it was the first installment to be hosted by Gates which included Americans of all ethnic and racial backgrounds. Starting with ''Finding Your Roots'' in 2012, the series changed from a season-long plot to having plots extending only within a single episode. In doing so, it has allowed the series to extend its number of episodes each season to ten, opposed to the prior four episodes a season.<ref name=fyr>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/finding-your-roots/about/|title=Finding Your Roots&nbsp;– About|work=[[PBS]]|accessdate=September 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918004128/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/finding-your-roots/about/|archivedate=September 18, 2014}}</ref>

===Ben Affleck controversy===
The show's third season was postponed by [[WNET]] after it was discovered that actor [[Ben Affleck]] had persuaded Gates to omit information about his slave-owning ancestors.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11546891/Ben-Afflecks-slave-owning-ancestor-censored-from-genealogy-show.html|title=Ben Affleck's slave-owning ancestor 'censored' from genealogy show|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=[[London]]|first=Nick|last=Allen|date=April 17, 2015|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ben-affleck-demanded-pbs-suppress-his-slave-owning-ancestry/|title=Ben Affleck Demanded PBS Suppress His Slave-Owning Ancestry|work=[[Mediaite]]|first=Andrew|last=Kirell|date=April 18, 2015|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Koblin>{{cite news|last=Koblin|first=John|title=Citing Ben Affleck's 'Improper Influence,' PBS Suspends 'Finding Your Roots'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/business/media/citing-ben-afflecks-improper-influence-pbs-suspends-finding-your-roots.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news|accessdate=June 25, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=June 24, 2015}}</ref> The series returned on January 5, 2016,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/pbs-finding-your-roots-returns-832976|title=PBS' 'Finding Your Roots' Returns After Ben Affleck Scandal: "Hard Conversations," More Rigorous Process|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|location=[[Los Angeles]]|date=October 19, 2015|first=Marisa|last=Guthrie|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}</ref> although "Roots of Freedom", the second-season episode featuring Affleck, was pulled from all forms of distribution by PBS.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/pbs-ben-affleck-finding-your-804969|title=PBS: Ben Affleck 'Finding Your Roots' Episode Violated Standards|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|location=[[Los Angeles]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=June 24, 2015|accessdate=October 27, 2018}}</ref> [[PBS America]], a U.K. TV channel featuring content from PBS in the U.S., continues to feature three clips from the withdrawn episode on their YouTube channel.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[PBS America]]|title=Finding Your Roots: Khandi Alexander|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MED-VVpB9Ag|date=2015-01-08|access-date=2018-10-27|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[PBS America]]|title=Finding Your Roots: Ben Affleck (Freedom Summer)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WtVYtJYYM|date=2015-01-08|access-date=2018-10-27|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[PBS America]]|title=Finding Your Roots: Ben Affleck (Civil War)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMiYc5C7DY0|date=2015-01-08|access-date=2018-10-27|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
