At the age of 11, Slim invested in a government savings bond that taught him about the concept of [[compound interest]]. He eventually saved every financial and business transaction he made into a personal ledger book, which he still keeps.<ref name="auto3">{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2007/0326/070.html | title=Mexico's Richest Man | work=Forbes | access-date=April 10, 2015}}</ref>

Though Slim was a civil engineering major, he also displayed an interest in economics. He took economics courses in [[Chile]] once he finished his engineering degree.<ref name="Academy of Achievement" /> Graduating as a civil engineering major, Slim has stated that his mathematical ability and his background of [[linear programming]] was a key factor in helping him gain an edge in the business world, especially when reading financial statements.<ref name="Harriet Alexander" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/040515/what-education-do-you-need-become-billionaire.asp | title=What Education Do You Need To Become A Billionaire? | publisher=Investopedia | date=April 5, 2015 | access-date=June 17, 2015 | author=Lauren Welch}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://qz.com/240820/if-you-want-to-be-rich-and-powerful-majoring-in-stem-is-a-good-place-to-start/ | title=If you want to be rich and powerful, majoring in STEM is a good place to start | publisher=Quartz | date=July 28, 2014 | access-date=June 17, 2015 | author=Wai, Jonathan}}</ref>

== Business career ==

=== 1960s ===
After graduating from college in 1961, Slim began his career as a [[stock trader]] in Mexico, often working 14-hour days.<ref name="EvanCarMichael" /> In 1965, profits from Slim's private investments reached {{US$|400,000}}<!-- we are not allowed to use inflation calculators for wealth -->,<ref name="US Inflation Calculator">{{cite web | url=http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/ | title=US Inflation Calculator | publisher=US Inflation Calculator | access-date=April 26, 2015}}</ref> allowing him to start the stock brokerage Inversora Bursátil.<ref name="Carlos Slim" /> In addition, he also began laying the financial groundwork for Grupo Carso.<ref name="auto1" /> In 1965 he also bought [[Jarritos]] del Sur.

=== 1970s ===

Companies in the construction, soft drink, printing, real estate, bottling and mining industries were the focus of Slim's early burgeoning business career.<ref name="Sean Braswell" />  He later expanded into numerous industries including auto parts, aluminium, airlines, chemicals, tobacco, manufacturing of cables and wires, paper and packaging, copper and mineral extraction, tires, cement, retail, hotels, beverage distributors, telecommunications and financial services where Slim's Grupo Financiero Inbursa – which sells insurance and invests the savings, mutual funds and pension plans of millions of ordinary Mexicans.<ref name="auto1" /><ref name="auto2">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1012/03/lkl.01.html | title=CNN LARRY KING LIVE | publisher=CNN | date=December 3, 2010 | access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref>  By 1972, he had established or acquired a further seven businesses in these categories, including one which rented construction equipment. In 1976, he branched out by acquiring a 60 percent share of Galas de México, a small printer of cigarette-pack labels for {{US$|1{{nbsp}}million}}, and in 1980, he consolidated his business interests by forming Grupo Galas as the [[parent company]] of a conglomerate that had interests in industry, construction, [[mining]], [[retail industry|retail]], food, and [[tobacco industry|tobacco]].<ref name="slimbio" /> In 1981, Slim acquired a majority stake in Cigarros la Tabacelera Mexicana (Cigatam), Mexico's second largest producer and marketer of cigarettes, at a reduced price.<ref name="EvanCarMichael" />

=== 1980s ===

In 1982, the [[Economy of Mexico|Mexican economy]] contracted rapidly. As many banks were struggling and foreign investors were cutting back on investing and scurrying, Slim began investing heavily and bought many flagship companies at depressed valuations.<ref name="EvanCarMichael" /> Buying troubled assets at depressed prices to resell them later at an attractive price is a business strategy that Slim has executed throughout his career.<ref name="Sean Braswell" /><ref name="auto5">{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2015/05/07/billionaire-carlos-slim-listing-fifth-ave-mansion-for-80-million-almost-two-times-as-what-he-paid/ | title=Billionaire Carlos Slim Listing Fifth Ave Mansion For $80 Million, Almost Two Times What He Paid | work=Forbes | access-date=May 9, 2015 | author=Dolia Estevez}}</ref>

Having a keen investment eye for [[value investing|value]], Slim adhered to his value investment practices with a long history of buying stakes in companies he sees as undervalued.<ref name="Global Energy Profs">{{cite web | url=http://www.globalenergyprofs.com/2012/06/mexicos-carlos-slim-buys-8-4-stake-in-argentinas-ypf/ | title=Mexico's Carlos Slim Buys 8.4% Stake in Argentina's YPF | publisher=Global Energy Profs | access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref> Much of Slim's business dealings involved a simple strategy, which is to buy a business and hang on to it for its [[cash flow]] or eventually sell the [[Equity stake|stake]] at a greater profit in future, thereby netting the [[capital gain]]s as well as reinvesting the initial [[Principal (finance)|principal]] into a new business.<ref name="Jesse Emspak">{{cite web | url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/103114/how-carlos-slim-built-his-fortune.asp | title=How Carlos Slim Built His Fortune | publisher=Investopedia | access-date=April 12, 2015 | author=Jesse Emspak}}</ref> In addition, his conglomerate structure allows Slim to purchase numerous stakes that it is made nearly recession proof if one or more sectors of the economy do not do well. 

From the mid 1960s to the early 1980s, Slim and his growing family lived a modest life, while earnings from Slim's many businesses were re-invested in expansion and more acquisitions. Slim acquired companies with strong returns on capital he believed were undervalued and overhauled their management. He diversified methodically in numerous industry sectors across the Mexican economy, investing in real estate, then a construction equipment company, and mining companies. The portfolio of Slim companies grew to include a printing company, a tobacco company and retail stores.<ref name="Carlos Slim" />

During the Mexican economic downturn before its recovery in 1985, Slim invested heavily. He bought all or a large percentage of numerous Mexican businesses, including Empresas Frisco, a mining and chemicals company producing silver, gold, copper, lead, and zinc from extracted ores, and also chemical products such as hydrofluoric acid and molybdenum for only $50 million, Industrias Nacobre, a manufacturer of copper products, Reynolds Aluminio, Compania Hulera Euzkadi, Mexico's largest tire maker, Bimex hotels, and majority share of [[Sanborns|Sanborn Hermanos]] food retailer, gift shop and restaurant chain. Slim spent {{US$|13{{nbsp}}million}} to buy insurance company Seguros de México in 1984, and later absorbed the company into the firm, Seguros Inbursa.<ref name="Carlos Slim" /> The value of his stake in Seguros eventually became worth {{US$|1.5{{nbsp}}billion}} by 2007, after four spinoffs.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2007/0326/070.html | title=Mexico's Richest Man | work=Forbes | date=March 16, 2007 | access-date=April 10, 2015 | author=Helen Coster}}</ref> He also acquired a 40% and 50% interest in the Mexican arms of [[British American Tobacco]] and [[The Hershey Company]], respectively as well as acquiring large blocks of [[Denny's]] and [[Firestone Tires]]. He moved into financial services as well, buying Seguros de México and creating from it, along with other purchases such as Fianzas La Guardiana and Casa de Bolsa Inbursa, the [[Inbursa|Grupo Financiero Inbursa]]. Many of these acquisitions were financed by the revenues and cash flows from Cigatam, a tobacco business which he bought early in the economic downturn.<ref name="auto4" /><ref name="slimbio" />

In 1988, Slim bought the Nacobre group of companies, which trades in copper and aluminum products, along with a chemicals business, Química Fluor, and others.<ref name="slimbio" />

=== 1990s ===

Slim made a large fortune in the early 1990s when Mexico privatized its telecom industry and Grupo Carso acquired Telmex from the Mexican government.<ref name="Sean Braswell" /> In 1990 the Grupo Carso was floated as a public company initially in Mexico and then worldwide.<ref name="slimbio" /> Grupo Carso also acquired majority ownership of Porcelanite, a tile making company in 1990. This investment was assigned to an associated company, but in 1995 Grupo Carso began growing its equity stake to 83 percent and subsequently made it a subsidiary.<ref name="auto4" />

Later in 1990, Slim acted in concert with [[France Télécom]] and [[SBC Communications|Southwestern Bell Corporation]] in order to buy the [[landline]] telephone company [[Telmex]] from the Mexican government, when Mexico began privatizing its national industries.<ref name="slimbio" /> Slim was one of the initial investors of Telmex, the revenues of the company eventually formed the bulk of Slim's wealth.<ref name="Jesse Emspak" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chron.com/business/article/Carlos-Slim-offers-tips-for-making-most-of-1591071.php | title=Carlos Slim offers tips for making most of downturn | work=Houston Chronicle | date=November 18, 2008 | access-date=June 5, 2015 |author1=DAVID HENDRICKS }}</ref> By 2006, 90 percent of the telephone lines in Mexico were operated by Telmex, and his mobile telephone company, [[Telcel]], which was created out of the Radiomóvil Dipsa company,<ref name="slimbio" /> operated almost 80 percent of all the country's cellphones.<ref name="nyt20060603">{{Cite news|first=Ginger|last=Thompson|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/03/world/americas/03slim.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5088&en=87ff5ffac4ee12aa&ex=1306987200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=Prodded by the Left, Mexico's Richest Man Talks Equity|date=June 3, 2006|work=The New York Times }}</ref> By 2012, América Movil, Slim's mobile telephone company, had taken over Telmex and made it into a privately held subsidiary.<ref name="Jesse Emspak" />

In 1991, he acquired Hoteles Calinda (now OSTAR Grupo Hotelero), and in 1993, he increased his stakes in General Tire and Grupo Aluminio to the point where he had a [[controlling interest|majority interest]].<ref name="slimbio" />

In 1996, Grupo Carso was split into three companies: Carso Global Telecom, Grupo Carso, and Invercorporación. In the following year, Slim bought the Mexican arm of [[Sears]] Roebuck.<ref name="slimbio" /> In July 1997 Grupo Carso agreed in principle to sell Procter & Gamble de México, a subsidiary of The Procter & Gamble Co., a manufacturing plant in Apizaco and the company's Lypps, Pampys, and other toilet-tissue brands for about {{US$|170{{nbsp}}million}} but kept its tissue-products company Fábricas de Papel Loreto y Peña Pobre.<ref name="auto4" />

In 1999, Slim began expanding his business interests beyond Latin America. Though the bulk of his holdings still remained in Mexico, he began setting his sights towards the United States for overseas investments.

=== 2000s ===
Slim became a prominent figure within the American business scene by 2003 when he began purchasing large stakes in a number of major US retailers such as [[Barnes & Noble]], [[OfficeMax]], [[Office Depot]], [[Circuit City]], [[Borders Group|Borders]], and [[CompUSA]].<ref name="auto">{{cite book | title=World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability | publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing | author=Chua, Amy | year=2004 | page=[https://archive.org/details/worldonfirehowex00chua_0/page/62 62] | isbn=978-0-385-72186-8 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/worldonfirehowex00chua_0/page/62 }}</ref> Much of the reason behind Slim's international expansion was due to a running joke in the Mexican business scene where "there was nothing left to acquire in Mexico".<ref name="auto" />  He eyed towards investing the United States where he set up Telmex USA and also acquired a stake in [[TracFone Wireless|Tracfone]], a US cellular telephone company. At the same time, he established Carso Infraestructura y Construcción, S. A. (CICSA) as a construction and engineering company within Grupo Carso.<ref name="slimbio" /> During the same year, Slim had heart surgery and subsequently passed on much of the day-to-day involvement in the businesses to his children and their spouses.<ref name="nyt20060603" />

América Telecom, the holding company for América Móvil, was incorporated in 2000. It took stakes in cellular telephone companies outside of Mexico, including the Brazilian ATL and Telecom Americas concerns, Techtel in [[Argentina]], and others in [[Guatemala]] and [[Ecuador]]. In subsequent years, there were investment in Latin America, with companies in [[Colombia]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Peru]], [[Chile]], [[Honduras]], and [[El Salvador]], as well as a venture with [[Microsoft]].

In 2005 Slim invested in [[Volaris]], a Mexican airline<ref name="slimbio" /> and established Impulsora del Desarrollo y el Empleo en América Latina SAB de CV (using the acronym "IDEAL"—roughly translated as "Promoter of Development and Employment in Latin America"), a Mexican construction and civil engineering company primarily engaged in not-for-profit infrastructure development.  Since 2006,  IDEAL won three infrastructure contracts yet it faces stiff competition from a number of other Mexican and Spanish construction companies. The number of contracts is fewer than its biggest local competitor, Empresas ICA. During the same period, Empresas obtained 18 Mexican projects valued at US$1.09{{nbsp}}billion, including airports, toll roads, hospitals and oil platforms. Some of the projects IDEAL has been awarded include the Nezahualcoyotl development, which is a landfill that was acquired for US$150{{nbsp}}million by Slim to develop a shopping mall, two schools, a hospital and a park on the site. Other contracts IDEAL has been awarded include a water-treatment plant contract, and a real estate partnership with the Mexican hospital chain Star Médica. IDEAL is also betting on one of the poorest landfills surrounding Mexico City. Slim has also planned to purchase several toll roads offered by the Mexican government that it took over from private companies following the December 1994 currency devaluation.<ref name="Adriana Arai">{{cite web | url=http://banderasnews.com/0705/nz-carlosslim.htm | title=Carlos Slim Moves From Telecommunications Into Real Estate | publisher=Banderas News | access-date=May 20, 2015 | author=Adriana Arai}}</ref> Though speculation that the landfill will take about 12 years to yield a return, the development of a such poor area is revealed to promise handsome business profits over the years as [[Grupo Elektra]], Mexico's largest consumer electronics retailer, sells 2,000 flat screen televisions a year at its store in the area, making it the third-best-selling outlet. Included in the development, IDEAL will also collect rent from a university, a hospital and a school that will be built around a mall, will have 178 stores, including Inditex's Zara fashion chain and Slim's Grupo Sanborns and the Mexican unit of Sears Holdings. A park in Nezahualcoyotl, the first of its kind will also be constructed. The park will comprise 34 soccer fields, 12 tennis, basketball and volleyball courts, a baseball field and a gym with a swimming pool.<ref name="TONY CLARKE, SABRINA FERNANDES, RICHARD GIRARD" /><ref name="Adriana Arai" />

In 2007, after having amassed a 50.1% stake in the Cigatam tobacco company, Slim reduced his holdings by selling a large portion of his equity to [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] for US$1.1{{nbsp}}billion, while in the same year also selling his entire interest in a tile company, Porcelanite, for US$800{{nbsp}}million. He licensed the Saks name and opened the Mexican arm of [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] in [[Santa Fe (Mexico City)|Santa Fe]], Mexico. During the same year, the estimated value of all of Slim's companies was at US$150{{nbsp}}billion.<ref name="Carlos Slim" /> On December 8, 2007, Grupo Carso announced that the remaining 103 [[CompUSA]] stores would be either liquidated or sold, bringing an end to the struggling company,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/08/BU3ETQI3S.DTL|title=End of the Line for CompUSA|work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=December 9, 2007|access-date=December 9, 2007}}</ref> although the IT tech part of [[CompUSA]] continued under the name Telvista with U.S. locations in [[Dallas]], Texas (U.S. Corporate Office) and [[Danville, Virginia]].

It was not uncommon for Lebanese children to be sent abroad before they reached the age of 15 to avoid being [[Conscription in the Ottoman Empire|conscripted]] into the [[Ottoman Army (1861–1922)|Ottoman Army]], and four of Haddad's older brothers were already living in Mexico at the time of his arrival.<ref name="slimbio">{{cite web |url=http://www.carlosslim.com/biografia_ing.html |title=Biography |publisher=Carlos Slim Helú |access-date=February 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824170413/http://www.carlosslim.com/biografia_ing.html |archive-date=August 24, 2011 |url-status=dead }}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2011}}</ref>

=== Real estate ===

Slim lives in a 6-bedroom home in the Lomas de Chapultepec district of Mexico City,<ref>{{cite web| author=[[Shawn Baldwin]] |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3017385/shawn-baldwin-analyses-carlos-slim-builds-value-creation |title=Carlos Slim Generates Billions of Value Creation in Telecom |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=August 23, 2014}}</ref> close to where he grew up, that has been his residence for over 40{{nbsp}}years. Slim's real estate holding company Inmobiliaria Carso develops, invests, owns and operates many residential and commercial properties across Mexico. The company owns over 20 shopping centers, including ten in Mexico City, and operates stores in the country under U.S. brands including the Mexican arms of Saks Fifth Avenue, Sears and the Coffee Factory. Slim has been making private real estate investments around the world, particularly in the United States. He has been reported to have acquired 417 Fifth Avenue, an 11-story office tower for {{US$|140{{nbsp}}million}} and also a piece of the former New York Times building on West 43rd street. He controls approximately 8 acres of prime Beverly Hills real estate at the corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica Boulevards.<ref name="Adam Hayes" /> 

In May 2014, Slim opened Inbursa Aquarium, Latin America's largest aquarium.<ref name="Jan-Albert Hootsen" /> Slim owns the [[Benjamin N. Duke House|Duke Seamans mansion]], a 1901 beaux arts house on 5th Avenue in New York City, which he bought for $44 million in 2010.

== Philanthropy ==

Slim has been publicly skeptical of [[The Giving Pledge]] by [[Bill Gates]] and [[Warren Buffett]] giving away at least half of their fortunes. But—according to his spokesman—he devoted {{US$|4{{nbsp}}billion}}, or roughly 5%, to his Carlos Slim foundation as of 2011.<ref name="ForbesBlog" /> Though Slim has not gone as far as Gates and Buffett in pledging more than half of his fortune, Slim has expressed firm support for philanthropy and has advised budding entrepreneurs that businessmen must do more than give{{nsmdns}}they "should participate in solving problems".<ref name="Sean Braswell" />  Slim has channeled his philanthropic endeavors into many initiatives such as funding a genomic medicine research project, subsidizing numerous arts and education projects in Mexico City, including the [[Museo Soumaya]] (named after his late wife), which displays his art collection for no admission fee.<ref name="Sean Braswell" />

Slim founded three nonprofit foundations concentrating on Mexico City: one for the arts, education, and health care; one for sports; and one for downtown restoration.

=== ''Fundación Carlos Slim Helú'' ===

Established in 1986 ''[[Carlos Slim Foundation|Fundación Carlos Slim Helú]]'' sponsors the [[Museo Soumaya]] in Mexico City, named after Slim's late wife, Soumaya Domit, opened 2011. It holds 66,000 pieces, including religious relics, contains the world's second-largest collection of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] sculptures, including ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'', the largest [[Salvador Dalí]] collection in Latin America, works by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], and coins from the viceroys of Spain.<ref>{{cite news|last=Casey|first=Nicholas|title=Emperor's New Museum|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703300904576178381398949942|access-date=March 8, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=March 3, 2011}}</ref> The inauguration in 2011 was attended by the President of Mexico, Nobel Prize laureates, writers and other celebrities.<ref name=InauguracionMuseoSoumaya>{{cite news|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2011/03/02/sociedad/043n1soc|title= Slim: el Museo Soumaya Plaza Carso, para acercar el arte a quienes no pueden viajar|date=March 2, 2011|language=es}}</ref>

After stating that he had donated {{US$|4{{nbsp}}billion}} of dividends to ''Fundación Carlos Slim Helú'', {{US$|2{{nbsp}}billion}} in 2006, and another {{US$|2{{nbsp}}billion}} in 2010, Slim was ranked fifth in [[Forbes]]' World's Biggest Givers in May 2011.<ref name="ForbesBlog">{{cite news |url= https://blogs.forbes.com/kerryadolan/2011/05/20/mexicos-carlos-slim-joins-ranks-of-worlds-biggest-philanthropists/ |title=Mexico's Carlos Slim Joins Ranks of World's Biggest Philanthropists|author= Kerry A.

=== ''Fundación Telmex'' ===

In 1995 Slim established ''Fundación Telmex'', a broad-ranging philanthropic foundation, which as he announced in 2007 had been provided with an asset base of {{US$|4{{nbsp}}billion}} to establish ''Carso Institutes for Health, Sports and Education''. Furthermore, it was to work in support of an initiative of [[Bill Clinton]] to aid the people of Latin America.<ref name="slimbio" /> Because Mexican foundations are not required to publish their financial information, it is not possible to confirm Slim's claims of charitable giving through a public source.<ref name="ForbesBlog" /> The foundation has organized Copa Telmex, an amateur sports tournament, recognized in 2007 and 2008 by [[Guinness World Records]] as having the most participants of any such tournament in the world. Together with Fundación Carlos Slim Helú, Telmex announced in 2008 that it was to invest more than {{US$|250{{nbsp}}million}} in Mexican sports programs, from grass-roots level to Olympic standard.<ref name="slimbio" /> Telmex sponsored the [[Sauber Motorsport|Sauber F1 team]] for the 2011 season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-sauber-signs-sergio-perez-sponsor-telmex-for-2011/|title=F1: Sauber Signs Perez, Sponsor Telmex For 2011|publisher=speedtv.com|date=October 4, 2010|access-date=May 10, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724093805/http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-sauber-signs-sergio-perez-sponsor-telmex-for-2011/|archive-date=July 24, 2011}}</ref>

=== ''Fundación del Centro Histórico de la Ciudad de México A.C.'' ===

In 2000, Slim and ex-broadcaster [[Jacobo Zabludowsky]] organized the ''Fundación del Centro Histórico de la Ciudad de México A.C.'' (Mexico City Historic Center Foundation) to revitalize and rescue Mexico City's historic downtown area to enable more people to live, work and find entertainment there.<ref name="slimbio" /> He has been Chair of the Council for the Restoration of the Historic Downtown of Mexico City since 2001.<ref name=FundacionCentroHistorico>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacioncentrohistorico.com.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4&Itemid=6|title=Fundación Centro Histórico|publisher=fundacioncentrohistorico.com.mx}}</ref>

== Criticism ==

Slim's growing fortune has been a subject of controversy, because it has been amassed in a [[developing country]] where average per capita income does not surpass {{US$|14,500}} a year, and nearly 17% of the population lives in poverty.<ref name="UN">{{cite web | title=UN HDI table|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf|publisher=United Nations|year=2008|access-date=May 27, 2009}}</ref> Critics claim that Slim is a [[monopolist]], pointing to Telmex's control of 90% of the Mexican landline telephone market.

According to Celso Garrido, economist at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]], Slim's domination of Mexico's conglomerates prevents the growth of smaller companies, resulting in a shortage of paying jobs, forcing many Mexicans to seek better lives in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|last=Porras |first=Andy |title=Mexico's wealthiest mogul spurs controversy |work=Hispanic Link |date=July 13, 2007 |url=http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/25270 |access-date=May 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315234159/http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/25270 |archive-date=March 15, 2011 }}</ref>

In response to the criticism, Slim has stated, "When you live for others' opinions, you are dead. I don't want to live thinking about how I'll be remembered [by Mexican people]," claiming indifference about his position on Forbes list of the world's richest people. He has said he has no interest in becoming the world's richest person. When asked to explain his sudden increase in wealth at a press conference soon after Forbes annual rankings were published, he said, "The stock market goes up&nbsp;... and down", and noted that his fortune could quickly drop.<ref name="Forbes" />

Slim was criticized by the Dutch minister of economic affairs, [[Henk Kamp]], in 2013 for attempting to expand his telecom empire beyond the Americas by América Móvil's buy-out offer to [[KPN]], a Dutch landline and mobile telecommunications company privatized in the 1990s, by stating "an acquisition of KPN by a 'foreign company' could have consequences for the Netherlands' national security".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2013/09/13/dutch-government-issues-warning-on-takeover-of-telecom-firm-kpn-by-mexican-billionaire-carlos-slim/|title=Dutch Government Issues Warning on Takeover of Telecom Firm KPN By Mexican Billionaire Carlos Slim|date=September 13, 2013|author=Dolia Estevez|access-date=April 24, 2014}}</ref> Two years after Slim's failed bid to take over the company mainly due to political intervention and Slim's paucity of interest in purchasing the company, Slim's America Movil SAB began offering 2.25{{nbsp}}billion euros of [[convertible bond|bonds]] that can be converted into shares of Royal KPN NV. America Movil now controls a 21.1 percent stake of KPN with a market value of 3.1{{nbsp}}billion euros as of May 20, 2015. Slim has been slowly decreasing his holdings since he was forced to withdraw a 7.2-billion-euro bid for the Dutch phone line carrier in 2013 after negotiations broke down and KPN's preference share foundation blocked the takeover attempt.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-20/america-movil-offers-bonds-exchangeable-into-kpn-shares | title=America Movil Moves to Cut KPN Stake With Convertible Bond | publisher=Bloomberg Business | access-date=May 20, 2015 | author=Elco Van Groningen}}</ref>
