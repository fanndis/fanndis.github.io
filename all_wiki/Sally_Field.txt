==Career==
{{Main|List of Sally Field performances}}
=== 1965–1976 ===
[[File:1976 Sally Field & Joanne Woodward.JPG|thumb|upright|Field with [[Joanne Woodward]] in ''Sybil'' (1976)]]
Field got her start on television as the boy-crazy [[surfing|surfer]] girl in the sitcom ''[[Gidget (TV series)|Gidget]]'' (1965–1966). The show was not an initial success and was cancelled after a single season; however, summer reruns garnered respectable ratings, making the show a belated success. Wanting to find a new starring vehicle for Field, ABC next produced ''[[The Flying Nun]]'' with Field cast as Sister Bertrille for three seasons, from 1967 to 1970.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/gidget/|title=Gidget|publisher=CBS Interactive|website=TV.com|access-date=August 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822120020/http://www.tv.com/shows/gidget/|archive-date=August 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In an interview included on the Season One DVD release, Field said that she thoroughly enjoyed ''Gidget'', but hated ''The Flying Nun'', because she was not treated with respect by the show's directors. Field was then [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]], finding respectable roles difficult to obtain. In 1971, Field starred in the ABC [[television film]] ''[[Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring]]'', playing a discouraged teen runaway who returns home with a bearded, drug-abusing hippie (played by [[David Carradine]]).<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/471729/Maybe-I-ll-Come-Home-in-the-Spring/ " 'Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring' Overview"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005095335/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/471729/Maybe-I-ll-Come-Home-in-the-Spring/ |date=October 5, 2016 }}, [[Turner Classic Movies]], accessed October 3, 2016</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unobtainium13.com/2015/04/21/embracing-the-melodrama-part-ii-39-maybe-ill-come-home-in-the-spring-dir-by-joseph-sargent/|website=Unobtainium13.com|title=Embracing the Melodrama Part II #39: Maybe I'll Come Home In The Spring (dir by Joseph Sargent)|author=Bowman, Lisa Marie|date=April 21, 2015|access-date=March 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322204803/https://unobtainium13.com/2015/04/21/embracing-the-melodrama-part-ii-39-maybe-ill-come-home-in-the-spring-dir-by-joseph-sargent/|archive-date=March 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> She made several guest television appearances through the mid-1970s, including a role on the Western ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'', a popular series starring ''Gidget'' co-star [[Pete Duel]].<ref>[https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/alias-smith-and-jones/cast/199673/ " 'Alias Smith and Jones' Cast"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604052503/http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/alias-smith-and-jones/cast/199673/ |date=June 4, 2016 }} tvguide.com, accessed October 3, 2016</ref> She also appeared in the episode "Whisper" on the thriller ''[[Night Gallery]]''.

In 1973, Field was cast in a starring role opposite [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]] in the short-lived series ''[[The Girl with Something Extra]]'' from 1973 to 1974.<ref>[http://www.hollywood.com/tv/the-girl-with-something-extra-59508089/ "The Girl with Something Extra"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005073409/http://www.hollywood.com/tv/the-girl-with-something-extra-59508089/ |date=October 5, 2016 }} hollywood.com, accessed October 3, 2016</ref> Following the series' cancellation, Field studied at the [[Actors Studio]] with the acting teacher [[Lee Strasberg]]. Strasberg became a mentor to the actress, helping her to move past her television image of the girl next door. During this period, Field divorced her first husband in 1975.<ref name=biocom/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.strasberg.com/|title=Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute Alumni|website=Strasberg.com|access-date=April 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111153757/http://www.strasberg.com/|archive-date=January 11, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|first=David |last=Garfield|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|url=https://archive.org/details/playersplacestor00garf|url-access=registration|year=1980|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-02-542650-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/playersplacestor00garf/page/278 278]|chapter=Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of January 1980}}</ref>

Soon after studying with Strasberg, Field landed the title role in the 1976 television film ''[[Sybil (1976 film)|Sybil]]'', based on the book by [[Flora Rheta Schreiber]]. Her dramatic portrayal of a young woman afflicted with [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]] earned her a best dramatic actress [[Emmy Award]] in 1977<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/sally-field |title=Sally Field Emmy Winner |website=Emmys.com |access-date=2012-03-30}}</ref> and enabled her to break through the typecasting of her sitcom work.

===1977–1989===
In 1977, she co-starred with [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Jackie Gleason]], and [[Jerry Reed]] in the year's number-two highest-grossing film, ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=smokeyandthebandit.htm|title=Smokey and the Bandit (1977)|website=Boxofficemojo.com|date=January 1, 1982|accessdate=July 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709113946/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=smokeyandthebandit.htm|archive-date=July 9, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1979, Field played the same-named union organizer in ''[[Norma Rae]]'', a successful film that established her as a dramatic actress. [[Vincent Canby]], reviewing the film for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote: "''Norma Rae'' is a seriously concerned contemporary drama, illuminated by some very good performances and one, Miss Field's, that is spectacular."<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980DE3D81139E732A25751C0A9659C946890D6CF |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]} | first=Vincent | last=Canby | title=Film: 'Norma Rae', Mill-Town Story: Unionism in the South | date=March 2, 1979}}</ref> For her role in ''Norma Rae'', Field won the [[Prix d'interprétation féminine|Best Female Performance Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

Field appeared with Reynolds in three more films: ''[[The End (1978 film)|The End]]'', ''[[Hooper (film)|Hooper]]'', and ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]''.<ref name=overview>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/61489%7C137610/Sally-Field/ "Field Filmography"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005102816/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/61489%7C137610/Sally-Field/ |date=October 5, 2016 }}, Tcm.com, accessed October 3, 2016</ref> In 1981, she continued to change her image, playing a foul-mouthed prostitute opposite [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in the South-set film ''[[Back Roads (1981 film)|Back Roads]]''.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/20932/Back-Roads/ ''Black Roads''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005094933/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/20932/Back-Roads/ |date=October 5, 2016 }}, Tcm.com, accessed October 3, 2016</ref> She received Golden Globe nominations for the 1981 drama ''[[Absence of Malice]]'' and the 1982 comedy ''[[Kiss Me Goodbye (film)|Kiss Me Goodbye]]''.<ref name=gloge>[http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/sally-field "Sally Field Golden Globe Nominations"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911134334/http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/sally-field |date=September 11, 2016 }} goldenglobes.com, accessed October 3, 2016</ref>

Then came a second [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for her starring role in the 1984 drama ''[[Places in the Heart]]''.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140609212447/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1402298663451 "Academy Award 1984"] oscars.org, accessed October 3, 2016</ref> Field's gushing acceptance speech is well-remembered and has since been both admired as earnest and parodied as excessive. She said, "Oh Benton, what you did for me. You changed my life, truly! This means so much more to me this time. I don't know why, I think the first time I hardly felt it because it was all so new. I owe a lot to the cast, to my players. To Lindsay and John and Danny, and Ed and Amy, and my little friends, Gennie and Yankton. I owe a lot to my family for holding me together and loving me and having patience with this obsession of me. But I want to 'thank you' to you. I haven't had an orthodox career. And I've wanted more than anything to have your respect. The first time I didn't feel it, but this time I feel it. And I can't deny the fact that you like me...right now...you like me!
