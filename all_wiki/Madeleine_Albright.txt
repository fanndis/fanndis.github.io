After leaving the National Security Council, Albright joined the academic faculty of [[Georgetown University]] and advised [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates regarding foreign policy.  After Clinton's victory in the 1992 presidential election, Albright helped assemble his National Security Council.  In 1993, Clinton appointed her to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]]. She held that position until 1997, when she succeeded [[Warren Christopher]] as Secretary of State. Albright served in that capacity until Clinton left office in 2001.

==Early life and career==
Albright was born Marie Jana Korbelová in 1937 in the [[Smíchov]] district of [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name="birth">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/admin/albright.htm |title=Biography at The Washington Post |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date= December 15, 1999|access-date=June 22, 2009}}</ref> She is the daughter of [[Josef Korbel]], a Czech diplomat, and Anna Korbel (née Spieglová).<ref name="Tablet">{{cite magazine|url=http://tabletmag.com/podcasts/97886/madeleine-albrights-war-years|title=Madeleine Albright's War Years|magazine=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet Magazine]]|date=April 26, 2012|access-date=December 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310182057/https://www.tabletmag.com/podcasts/97886/madeleine-albrights-war-years |archive-date=2013-03-10}}</ref> At the time of her birth, Czechoslovakia had been independent for less than 20 years, having gained independence from the [[Austria-Hungary]] empire after [[World War I]].

When Marie Jana was born, her father was serving as a press-attaché at the Czechoslovak Embassy in [[Belgrade]]. The signing of the [[Munich Agreement]] in September 1938, and the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s troops forced the family into exile because of their links with Beneš.<ref>Albright, 2003: pp. 8–9</ref>

The family moved to Britain in May 1939. Here her father worked for Beneš's [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]]. Her family first lived on [[Kensington Park Road]] in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] – where they endured the worst of [[the Blitz]] – but later moved to [[Beaconsfield]], then [[Walton-on-Thames]], on the outskirts of London.<ref>Albright, 2003, pp. 9–11.</ref> They kept a [[Air-raid shelter#Morrison shelter|large metal table]] in the house, which was intended to shelter the family from the recurring threat of German air raids.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/profile-she-who-knows-tyranny-madeleine-albright-1143508.html|title=Profile: She who knows tyranny; Madeleine Albright|author=John Carlin|work=[[The Independent]]|date=February 8, 1998|access-date=November 3, 2014}}</ref> While in England, Marie Jana was one of the children shown in a documentary film designed to promote sympathy for war refugees in London.<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 9.</ref>

After the defeat of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in the [[European Theatre of World War II]] and the collapse of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], the Korbel family returned to Prague.{{Citation needed|reason=Needs reliable source|date=February 2019}} They were given a luxurious apartment in the [[Hradčany]] district. (This benefit generated controversy for the family, as the flat had belonged to an [[ethnic Germans|ethnic German Bohemian]] industrialist family who were forced out by the [[Beneš decrees]] to expel such families from the country. This was part of a multi-nation [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|expulsion of ethnic Germans]] from eastern Europe after the war. See "Controversies").

Korbel was appointed as Czechoslovakian Ambassador to [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and the family moved to Belgrade.{{Citation needed|reason=Needs reliable source|date=February 2019}} Yugoslavia was governed by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]], and Korbel was concerned his daughter would be exposed to [[Marxism]] in a Yugoslav school.

===Youth and young adulthood in the United States===
Korbel's family emigrated from the United Kingdom on the [[SS America (1939)|SS ''America'']], departing [[Southampton]] on November 5, 1948, and arriving at [[Ellis Island]] in [[New York Harbor]] on November 11, 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libertyellisfoundation.org/passenger-details/czoxMzoiOTAxMTg2NjE2MTgwOSI7/czo5OiJwYXNzZW5nZXIiOw==|title=Passenger Manifest|work=The Statue of Liberty – Ellis Island Foundation|access-date=December 31, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Dobbs">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhZghL4Rr-EC |title=Madeleine Albright: A twentieth-century odyssey |first=Michael |last=Dobbs |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |access-date=December 31, 2014 |isbn=0-8050-5659-9 |year=1999}}</ref> The family initially settled in [[Great Neck]] on the North Shore of [[Long Island]].<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 18.</ref> Korbel applied for [[political asylum]], arguing that as an opponent of Communism, he was under threat in Prague.<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 19–20.</ref>

With the help of Philip Moseley, a professor of [[Russian language|Russian]] at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], Korbel obtained a position on the staff of the political science department at the [[University of Denver]] in [[Colorado]].<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 20.</ref> He became dean of the university's school of [[international relations]], and later taught future U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]].

Madeline Korbel spent her teen years in [[Denver]], and in 1955 graduated from the [[Kent Denver School]] in [[Cherry Hills Village, Colorado|Cherry Hills Village]], a suburb of Denver. She founded the school's international relations club and was its first president.<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 24.</ref> She attended [[Wellesley College]], in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], on a full scholarship, majoring in [[political science]], and graduated in 1959.<ref name=autogenerated3>Albright, 2003, p. 47.</ref> The topic of her senior thesis was [[Zdeněk Fierlinger]], a former Czechoslovakian Prime Minister.<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 43.</ref> She became a naturalized [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizen]] in 1957, and joined the [[College Democrats of America]].<ref>Albright, 2003, pp. 34–35.</ref>

While home in Denver from Wellesley, Korbel worked as an intern for ''[[The Denver Post]]''. There she met [[Joseph Medill Patterson Albright]]. He was the nephew of [[Alicia Patterson]], owner of ''[[Newsday]]'' and wife of philanthropist [[Harry Frank Guggenheim]].<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 36.</ref> Korbel converted to the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] at the time of her marriage.<ref name=dobbs/><ref name="ushmm_2007-04-12"/> The couple were married in Wellesley in 1959, shortly after her graduation.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

In January 1960, the couple moved to her husband's hometown of [[Chicago]], Illinois. Joseph worked at the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' as a journalist, and Albright worked as a picture editor for ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.<ref>Albright, 2003, pp. 49–50.</ref> The following year, Joseph Albright began work at ''[[Newsday]]'' in New York City, and the couple moved to [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]] on Long Island.<ref name=autogenerated5>Albright, 2003, p. 52.</ref> That year, she gave birth to twin daughters, Alice Patterson Albright and Anne Korbel Albright. The twins were born six weeks premature and required a long hospital stay. As a distraction, Albright began [[Russian language|Russian]] classes at [[Hofstra University]] in the [[Hempstead (village), New York|Village of Hempstead]] nearby.<ref name=autogenerated5 />

In 1962, the family moved to Washington, DC, where they lived in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]]. Albright studied [[international relations]] and continued in Russian at the [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies]], a division of [[Johns Hopkins University]] in the capital.<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 54.</ref>

In 1963 Joseph's aunt Alicia Patterson died, and the Albrights returned to Long Island with the notion of Joseph taking over the family newspaper business.<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 55.</ref> In 1967 Albright gave birth to another daughter, Katherine Medill Albright.

She earned a certificate in Russian, an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], writing her master's [[thesis]] on the [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs|Soviet diplomatic corps]] and her doctoral [[dissertation]] on the role of journalists in the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968.<ref>Albright, 2003, pp. 56, 59, 71.</ref> She also took a graduate course given by [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], who later became her boss at the [[United States National Security Council|U.S. National Security Council]].<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 57.</ref>

==Career==
===Early career===
Albright returned to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1968, and commuted to [[Columbia University|Columbia]] for her [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree, which she received in 1975.<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 71.</ref> She began fund-raising for her daughters' school, involvement which led to several positions on education boards.<ref>Albright, 2003, pp. 63–66.</ref> She was eventually invited to organize a fund-raising dinner for the 1972 presidential campaign of U.S. Senator [[Ed Muskie]] of [[Maine]].<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 65.</ref> This association with Muskie led to a position as his chief legislative assistant in 1976.<ref name=scott99>{{cite magazine | first = A.

===U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations===
Albright was appointed [[Ambassador to the United Nations]] shortly after Clinton was inaugurated, presenting her credentials on February 9, 1993. During her tenure at the U.N., she had a rocky relationship with the [[United Nations Secretary-General|U.N. Secretary-General]], [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], whom she criticized as "disengaged" and "neglect[ful]" of genocide in [[Rwanda]].<ref name=ms207>Albright, 2003, p. 207.</ref> Albright wrote: "My deepest regret from my years in public service is the failure of the United States and the international community to act sooner to halt these crimes."<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 147.</ref>

In ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (book)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]'', [[Roméo Dallaire]] claims that in 1994, in Albright's role as the U.S. [[UN Permanent Representative|Permanent Representative to the U.N.]], she avoided describing the killings in Rwanda as "genocide" until overwhelmed by the evidence for it;<ref>{{cite book

Also in 1996, after Cuban military pilots shot down two small civilian aircraft flown by the Cuban-American exile group [[Brothers to the Rescue]] over international waters, she announced, "This is not [[courage|''cojones'']].

The United States then fought a four-round veto duel with France, forcing it to back down and accept [[Kofi Annan]] as the next Secretary-General. In his memoirs, Clarke said that "the entire operation had strengthened Albright's hand in the competition to be Secretary of State in the second Clinton administration."<ref name="clarke2004"/>

The top level of the Clinton administration was divided into two camps on selecting the new foreign policy. Outgoing Chief of Staff Leon Panetta favored Albright, but a separate faction argued, "anybody but Albright", with [[Sam Nunn]] as its first choice. Albright orchestrated a campaign on her own behalf that proved successful.<ref>Thomas Blood, ''Madam Secretary'' (1997) pp 12-34.</ref> When Albright took office as the 64th U.S. Secretary of State on January 23, 1997, she became the first female U.S. Secretary of State and the highest-ranking woman in the history of the U.S. government at the time of her appointment.<ref>{{cite web

During her tenure, Albright considerably influenced American foreign policy in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Middle East]]. According to Albright's memoirs, she once argued with [[Colin Powell]] for the use of military force by asking, "What's the point of you saving [[Military of the United States|this superb military]] for, Colin, if we can't use it?"<ref>Albright, 2003, p. 182.</ref>

As Secretary of State, she represented the U.S. at the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] on July 1, 1997.

In February 1998, Albright partook in a town-hall style meeting at [[St. John Arena]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] where she, [[William Cohen]], and [[Sandy Berger]] attempted to make the case for military action in Iraq.

In the context of the 1998 Iraq campaign, Albright expressed another justification, saying, "But if we have to use force, it is because we are America; we are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future, and we see the danger here to all of us."<ref>Interview on NBC-TV, (Transcript, February 19, 1998, USIS Washington File, {{cite web |url=http://fas.org/news/iraq/1998/02/19/98021907_tpo.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 22, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308041542/http://fas.org/news/iraq/1998/02/19/98021907_tpo.html |archive-date=March 8, 2016 }}).</ref>

====2003 Iraq War====
According to Politifact, Albright opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], although after the U.S. was committed to the war, she said she would support the President.<ref>[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/07/bernie-s/foreign-policy-spat-bernie-sanders-suggests-madele/ In foreign policy spat, Bernie Sanders suggests Madeleine Albright supported Iraq invasion], By Linda Qiu on Sunday, February 7, 2016.

====Art ownership lawsuit====
Following the ''[[Washington Post]]'''s profile of Albright by [[Michael Dobbs]], an Austrian man named Philipp Harmer launched legal action against Albright, claiming her father had illegally taken possession of artwork that belonged to his great-grandfather, Karl Nebrich.<ref name="The Prague Post">{{cite web

}}</ref> Nebrich, a German-speaking Prague industrialist, was forced to abandon some of his possessions when ethnic Germans were expelled from the country after World War II under the [[Beneš decrees]]. His apartment, at 11 Hradčanská Street in Prague, was subsequently given to Korbel and his family, which they occupied before also being forced to flee to America. Harmer felt Korbel stole his great-grandfather's artwork, which was left in the apartment. The matter was handled by Albright's brother, John Korbel.<ref name="The Prague Post"/>

====Allegations of hate speech against Serbs====
[[File:Palác Luxor 05.JPG|thumb|upright|The place where the Prague incident took place.]]
In late October 2012, during a book signing in the Prague bookstore ''Palác Knih Luxor'', Albright was visited by a group of activists from the Czech organization "Přátelé Srbů na Kosovu". She was filmed saying, "Disgusting Serbs, get out!" to the Czech group, which had brought war photos to the signing, some of which showed Serbian victims of the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999. The protesters were expelled from the event when police arrived. Two videos of the incident were later posted by the group on their [[YouTube]] channel.<ref>{{cite video

Albright's involvement in the [[NATO bombing of Serbia]] was the main cause of the demonstration – a sensitive topic which became even more controversial when it was revealed that her investment firm, Albright Capital Management, was preparing to bid in the proposed [[Economy of Kosovo#Foreign direct investment in Kosovo|privatization]] of Kosovo's state-owned telecom and postal company, [[Post and Telecom of Kosovo]]. In an article published by the New York-based magazine ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', it was estimated that the deal could be as large as €600&nbsp;million. Serbia opposed the sale, and intended to file a lawsuit to block it, alleging that the rights of former Serbian employees were not respected.<ref>

While introducing Clinton at a campaign event in [[New Hampshire]] ahead of [[New Hampshire primary|that state's primary]], Albright said, "There's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other" (a phrase Albright had used on several previous occasions in other contexts).<ref name="My Undiplomatic Moment"/> The remark was seen as a rebuke of younger women who supported Clinton's [[Primary election|primary]] rival, Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], which many women found "startling and offensive."<ref>Alan Rappeport, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/us/politics/gloria-steinem-madeleine-albright-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders.html Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright Rebuke Young Women Backing Bernie Sanders], ''New York Times'' (February 8, 2016).</ref> In a ''New York Times'' [[op-ed]] published several days after the remark, Albright said: "I absolutely believe what I said, that women should help one another, but this was the wrong context and the wrong time to use that line. I did not mean to argue that women should support a particular candidate based solely on gender."<ref name="My Undiplomatic Moment">{{cite news |last1=Albright |first1=Madeleine |title=My Undiplomatic Moment |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/opinion/madeleine-albright-my-undiplomatic-moment.html |access-date=October 29, 2018 |agency=New York Times |date=February 12, 2016}}</ref>

Korbel was raised Roman Catholic, but converted to the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] at the time of her marriage in 1959.
