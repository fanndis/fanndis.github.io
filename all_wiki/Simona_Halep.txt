She has been ranked [[List of WTA number 1 ranked tennis players|world No. 1]] in singles twice between 2017 and 2019. In total, she has been [[List of WTA number 1 ranked tennis players#Weeks at No. 1|No. 1 for 64 weeks]], which ranks tenth in the history of the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) rankings. Halep was the year-end No. 1 in 2017 and 2018. She has finished each year ranked no lower than No. 4 since 2014 and has the longest active streak of being ranked in the top 10. She has won 22 WTA singles titles and has finished runner-up 17 times. Halep has won two [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles: the [[2018 French Open]] and the [[2019 Wimbledon Championships]].

Halep first broke into the world's top 50 at the end of 2011, reached the top 20 in August 2013, and then the top 10 in January 2014. She won her first six WTA titles in the same calendar year in 2013, and was the first to do so since [[Steffi Graf]] in 1986. This led to her being named the [[WTA Awards#Most Improved Player|WTA Most Improved Player]] at the end of the year. Halep reached three Grand Slam finals at the [[2014 French Open]], the [[2017 French Open]], and the [[2018 Australian Open]] before winning her first Grand Slam singles title at the 2018 French Open against [[Sloane Stephens]]. A former junior champion there, she became just the sixth player to win both the girls' singles and women's singles titles at the French Open. Halep also finished runner-up at the [[2014 WTA Finals]] to [[Serena Williams]] despite inflicting the worst loss of Williams' career at that point in the round robin stage. She did not defeat Williams a second time until the final of the 2019 Wimbledon Championships.

Halep was the [[WTA Awards#Most Popular Player of the Year|WTA Most Popular Player of the Year]] for two consecutive years in 2014 and 2015, as well as the [[WTA Awards#Fan Favorite Singles Player of the Year|WTA Fan Favorite Singles Player of the Year]] for three consecutive years in 2017, 2018, and 2019. She is a recipient of the [[Patriarchal Cross of Romania]] and the [[Order of the Star of Romania]], and was named an [[List of honorary citizens of Bucharest|honorary citizen of Bucharest]]. She is the third Romanian to be in the top 10 of the WTA rankings after [[Virginia Ruzici]] and [[Irina Spîrlea]], and the second Romanian woman to win a Grand Slam singles title after Ruzici. She is also the first Romanian woman to be ranked No. 1 and the first Romanian player to win a Wimbledon singles title. Halep is regarded as one of the best returners on the WTA Tour, while also building her game around being aggressive and being able to hit winners from defensive positions.

Around the time of her breakthrough in 2013, she transitioned from being a grinder who primarily scrambles to get a lot of balls back in play to someone who plays more aggressively. Journalist Louisa Thomas has compared her improved style of play to that of [[Novak Djokovic]] as someone who can hit strong but simple winners from defensive positions where opponents would expect a less aggressive shot. She can hit winners both cross-court and down-the-line. During points, Halep strives to disrupt her opponent's rhythm. She uses her speed and anticipation to set up powerful shots rather than just extend points.<ref name=grantland-2013/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/open-house-a-cacophony-of-errors/|title=Jankovic Over Halep: A Cacophony of Errors|website=New York Times|accessdate=2 September 2010|date=31 August 2010|first=Michael|last=Kimmelman|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221050216/http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/open-house-a-cacophony-of-errors/|archive-date=21 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Her fluidity and balance have been credited as the basis for this style of play that is both aggressive and defensive.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/maria-sharapova-edges-out-simona-halep-in-titanic-battle-to-land-french-open-title-30336945.html|title=Maria Sharapova edges out Simona Halep in titanic battle to land French Open title|accessdate=8 June 2014|date=7 June 2014|website=Independent|first=Eleanor|last=Crooks|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715054301/http://www.independent.ie/sport/maria-sharapova-edges-out-simona-halep-in-titanic-battle-to-land-french-open-title-30336945.html|archive-date=15 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Halep is popular in her home country of Romania. Journalist Adrian Toca has said, "Simona is without a doubt the biggest sports star in Romania".<ref name=new-yorker/> After Halep won Grand Slam titles at the [[2018 French Open]] and [[2019 Wimbledon Championships|2019 Wimbledon]], she was welcomed back to Romania with large celebrations at the [[Arena Națională]] in Bucharest. About 15,000 people attended the celebration after the 2018 French Open title and about 30,000 people attended after her 2019 Wimbledon triumph.

Halep's tennis idols growing up were former world No. 1 [[Justine Henin]] and compatriot [[Andrei Pavel]].
