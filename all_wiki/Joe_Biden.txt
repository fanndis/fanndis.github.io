In May 1974, Biden voted to table a proposal containing anti-busing and anti-desegregation clauses but later voted for a modified version containing a qualification that it was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th Amendment]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]].<ref name="Sokol">{{Cite news |last=Sokol |first=Jason |date=April 25, 2019 |title=How a Young Joe Biden Turned Liberals Against Integration |work=Politico |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/04/joe-biden-integration-school-busing-120968 |access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref> In 1975, he supported a proposal that would have prevented the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] from cutting federal funds to districts that refused to integrate;{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220–221}} he said busing was a "bankrupt idea [violating] the cardinal rule of common sense" and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name="cby-44">''Current Biography Yearbook 1987'', p. 44.</ref> At the same time he supported initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name="Sokol" /> Biden supported a measure{{when|date=October 2020}} forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them.

Beginning in 2019, Trump and his allies falsely accused Biden of getting the Ukrainian prosecutor general [[Viktor Shokin]] fired because he was supposedly pursuing an investigation into [[Burisma Holdings]], which employed Hunter Biden. Biden was accused of withholding $1{{nbsp}}billion in aid from Ukraine in this effort. In 2015, Biden pressured the Ukrainian parliament to remove Shokin because the United States, the European Union and other international organizations considered Shokin corrupt and ineffective, and in particular because Shokin was not assertively investigating Burisma.
