[[File:ODNI Statement on Declassified Intelligence Community Assessment of Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections.pdf|page=7|thumb|[[ODNI]] declassified assessment of "Russian activities and intentions in recent U.S. elections"]]

The [[Russian government]] interfered in the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]] with the goals of harming the campaign of [[Hillary Clinton]], boosting the candidacy of [[Donald Trump]], and increasing political and social discord in the United States. According to U.S. intelligence agencies, the operation was ordered directly by Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]].<ref name="officialsmasterspy" />

The [[Internet Research Agency]] (IRA), based in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] and described as a [[troll farm]], created thousands of [[social media]] accounts that purported to be Americans supporting radical political groups and planned or promoted events in support of Trump and against Clinton. They reached millions of social media users between 2013 and 2017. Fabricated articles and disinformation were spread from Russian government-controlled media, and promoted on social media. Additionally, [[computer hackers]] affiliated with the [[GRU|Russian military intelligence service]] (GRU) infiltrated information systems of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC), the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC), and [[Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign|Clinton campaign]] officials, notably chairman [[John Podesta]], and publicly released stolen files and emails through [[DCLeaks]], [[Guccifer 2.0]] and [[WikiLeaks]] during the election campaign. Several individuals connected to Russia contacted various [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|Trump campaign]] associates, offering business opportunities to the [[Trump Organization]] and proferring damaging information on Clinton. Russian government officials have denied involvement in any of the hacks or leaks.

Russian interference activities triggered strong statements from [[United States intelligence agencies]], a direct warning by then-U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] to Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], renewed [[economic sanctions]] against Russia, and closures of Russian diplomatic facilities and expulsion of their staff. The [[Senate Intelligence Committee|Senate]] and [[House Intelligence Committee]]s conducted their own investigations into the matter. Trump denied the interference had occurred, contending that it was a "hoax" perpetrated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to explain Clinton's loss. 

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) opened the [[Crossfire Hurricane (FBI investigation)|Crossfire Hurricane investigation]] of Russian interference in July 2016, including a special focus on [[links between Trump associates and Russian officials]] and suspected coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Russian attempts to interfere in the election were first disclosed publicly by members of the [[United States Congress]] in September 2016, confirmed by US intelligence agencies in October 2016, and further detailed by the [[Director of National Intelligence]] office in January 2017. The [[dismissal of James Comey]], the FBI Director, in May 2017, was partly because of Comey's investigation of the Russian interference.

The FBI's work was taken over in May 2017 by former FBI director [[Robert Mueller]], who led a [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel investigation]] until March 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/22/robert-mueller-submits-special-counsels-russia-probe-report-to-attorney-general-william-barr.html| title=Mueller probe Is over: Special counsel submits Russia report to Attorney General William Barr| last=Breuninger| first=Kevin| date=March 22, 2019| website=cnbc.com| access-date=March 22, 2019}}</ref> Mueller concluded that Russian interference was "sweeping and systematic" and "violated U.S. criminal law", and he [[Criminal charges brought in the Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|indicted twenty-six Russian citizens and three Russian organizations]]. The investigation also led to indictments and convictions of Trump campaign officials and associated Americans, on unrelated charges. The [[Mueller Report|Special Counsel's report]], made public in April 2019, examined numerous contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials but concluded that, though the Trump campaign welcomed the Russian activities and expected to benefit from them, there was insufficient evidence to bring any conspiracy or coordination charges against Trump or his associates.

The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee submitted the first in their five-volume [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election|1,313-page report]] in July 2019 in which they concluded that the January 2017 intelligence community assessment alleging Russian interference was "coherent and well-constructed". The first volume also concluded that the assessment was "proper", learning from analysts that there was "no politically motivated pressure to reach specific conclusions". The final and fifth volume, which was the result of three years of investigations, was released in August 2020,<ref name="Axios_Treene_20200818"/> ending one of the United States "highest-profile congressional inquiries."<ref name="NYT_Mazzetti_20200818"/><ref name="intelligence_senate_V1_2020">{{cite report |chapter-url=https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume1.pdf |volume=1 |date=2020 |title=Report Of The Select Committee On Intelligence United States Senate On Russian Active Measures Campaigns And Interference In The 2016 U.S. Election |chapter=Russian Efforts Against Election Infrastructure With Additional Views |pages=67 |number=II6–XX}}</ref> The Committee report found that the Russian government had engaged in an "extensive campaign" to sabotage the election in favor of Trump, which included assistance from some members of Trump's own advisers.<ref name="NYT_Mazzetti_20200818"/>

In November 2020, newly released passages from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report indicated that "Although WikiLeaks published emails stolen from the DNC in July and October 2016 and Stone — a close associate to Donald Trump — appeared to know in advance the materials were coming, investigators “did not have sufficient evidence” to prove active participation in the hacks or knowledge that the electronic thefts were continuing."<ref name=":0" />

In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta.

The first tranche of 19,000 emails and 8,000 attachments was released on July 22, 2016, three days before the Democratic convention. The resulting news coverage created the impression that the Democratic National Committee was biased against Clinton's Democratic primary challenger [[Bernie Sanders]] (who received 43% of votes cast in the Democratic presidential primaries) and forced DNC Chairwoman [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] to resign, disrupting the plans of the Clinton campaign.<ref name="Boot-wapo-24-7-18"/><ref name="MATISHAK-18-7-18"/>

=== Attempts to suppress African American votes and spread alienation ===

According to ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'', the Russian [[Internet Research Agency]] (IRA) focused on the culture of Muslims, Christians, Texas, and [[LGBTQ]] people, to engage those communities as part of a broader strategy to deepen social and political divisions within the U.S., but no other group received as much attention as [[Black Americans]],<ref name="ward-17-12-18"/> whose voter turnout has been historically crucial to the election of Democrats.

=== Arousing conservative voters ===

At least 25 social media pages drawing 1.4 million followers were created by Russian agents to target the American political right and promote the Trump candidacy.<ref name=NYTimesDec17/>
An example of the targeting was the adding of [[Blue Lives Matter]] material to social media platforms by Russian operatives after the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement moved to the center of public attention in the America and sparked a pro-police reaction.<ref name=NYTimesDec17/>

=== Intrusions into state voter-registration systems ===

During the summer and fall of 2016, Russian hackers intruded into voter databases and software systems in 39 different states, alarming Obama administration officials to the point that they took the unprecedented step of contacting Moscow directly via the [[Moscow–Washington hotline]] and warning that the attacks risked setting off a broader conflict.<ref name="Riley-13-6-17">{{cite news |last1=Riley |first1=Michael |last2=Robertson |first2=Jordan |title=Russian Hacks on U.S. Voting System Wider Than Previously Known |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-13/russian-breach-of-39-states-threatens-future-u-s-elections |access-date=February 22, 2019 |agency=Bloomberg |date=June 13, 2017}}</ref>

The committee wrote that the infiltrators' failure to exploit vulnerabilities in election systems could have been because they "decided against taking action" or because "they were merely gathering information and testing capabilities for a future attack".<ref name="SenateInterimSecurityReport" /> To prevent future infiltrations, the committee made a number of recommendations, including that "at a minimum, any machine purchased going forward should have a [[Voter-verified paper audit trail|voter-verified paper trail]] and no WiFi capability".<ref name="SenateInterimSecurityReport" /><ref>[https://www.burr.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/RussRptInstlmt1-%20ElecSec%20Findings,Recs2.pdf Russian Targeting of Election Infrastructure During the 2016 Election: Summary of Initial Findings and Recommendations], Senate Intelligence Committee, May 8, 2018.</ref>

In part because U.S. agencies cannot surveil U.S. citizens without a warrant, the U.S. was slow to recognize a pattern itself. From late 2015 until the summer of 2016, during routine surveillance of Russians, several countries discovered interactions between the Trump campaign and Moscow.

==== Counter-sanctions by Russia ====

On July 27, as the sanctions bill was being passed by the Senate, Putin pledged a response to "this kind of insolence towards our country".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/27/putin-russia-us-sanctions-bill Putin: Russia promises retaliation as Senate passes sanctions bill] ''The Guardian'', July 28, 2017.</ref> Shortly thereafter, Russia's foreign ministry [[Sergey Lavrov]] demanded that the U.S. reduce its diplomatic and technical personnel in the [[Embassy of the United States, Moscow|Moscow embassy]] and its consulates in St Petersburg, Ekaterinburg and Vladivostok to 455 persons—the same as the number of Russian diplomats posted in the U.S, and suspended the use of a retreat compound and a storage facility in Moscow.<ref name="roth">{{cite news|last1=Roth|first1=Andrew|title=Putin orders cut of 755 personnel at U.S. missions|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/putin-orders-cut-of-755-personnel-at-us-missions/2017/07/30/8a4b0044-7555-11e7-8c17-533c52b2f014_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 30, 2017 |access-date=August 5, 2017}}</ref> Putin said he had made this decision personally, and confirmed that 755 employees of the U.S. diplomatic mission must leave Russia.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40769365 Putin confirms 755 US diplomatic staff must leave] BBC, July 30, 2017.</ref><ref name="roth" />

== Impact on election result ==

As of October 2018, the question of whether Donald Trump won the 2016 election ''because'' of the Russian interference had not been given much focus—being declared impossible to determine, or ignored in favor of other factors that led to Trump's victory.<ref name="mayer-1-10-18"/><ref name=econ /> [[Joel Benenson]], the Clinton campaign's pollster, said we probably will never know, while [[Richard Burr]], the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said "we cannot calculate the impact that foreign meddling and social media had on this election". [[Michael V. Hayden]], a former director of the CIA and the NSA, believes that although the Russian attacks were "the most successful covert influence operation in history," what impact they had is "not just unknown, it's unknowable."<ref name="mayer-1-10-18"/>
Statistician [[Nate Silver]], writing in February 2018, described himself as "fairly agnostic" on the question, but notes "thematically, the Russian interference tactics were consistent with the reasons Clinton lost."<ref name="silver538">{{cite web |last1=Silver |first1=Nate |title=How Much Did Russian Interference Affect The 2016 Election? |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-did-russian-interference-affect-the-2016-election/ |website=538 |access-date=December 27, 2018 |date=February 16, 2018}}</ref>

Clinton supporters have been more likely to blame her defeat on campaign mistakes, Comey's [[Hillary Clinton email controversy#FBI investigation|reopening of the criminal investigation]] into her emails, or to direct attention to whether Trump colluded with Russia.<ref name="mayer-1-10-18"/>  In their book <i>Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign,</i> reporters Jonathan J.M.

Allen and Amie Parnes, <i>Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign</i>, (New York: Crown, 2017): 395-96.</ref>

Several high-level Republicans believe Russian interference did not determine the election's outcome, including those who would have benefited from Russia's efforts. President Trump has asserted that "the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever",<ref name="npr-6-3-2018">{{cite news |last1=Keith |first1=Tamara |title=Trump Says U.S. Working To Counteract Russian Election Interference In 2018 Midterms |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/03/06/590973788/trump-to-take-questions-in-joint-press-conference-with-swedish-prime-minister |access-date=December 23, 2018 |agency=NPR |date=March 6, 2018}}</ref> and Vice President Pence has claimed "it is the universal conclusion of our intelligence communities that none of those efforts had any impact on the outcome of the 2016 election."<ref name = Pence/> Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] also said "the intelligence community's assessment is that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election".<ref name="CROWLEY-19-10-17">{{cite news |last1=CROWLEY |first1=MICHAEL |title=CIA director rebuked for false claim on Kremlin's election meddling |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/19/mike-pompeo-cia-russia-influence-election-243967 |access-date=December 27, 2018 |agency=Politico |date=October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Boot-wapo-24-7-18">{{cite news |last1=Boot |first1=Max |title=Without the Russians, Trump wouldn't have won |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/without-the-russians-trump-wouldnt-have-won/2018/07/24/f4c87894-8f6b-11e8-bcd5-9d911c784c38_story.html |access-date=December 27, 2018 |agency=Washington Post |date=July 24, 2018}}</ref> In fact, the official intelligence assessment of January 2017 did not evaluate whether Russian activities had any impact on the election's outcome,<ref name="nymag.com">{{cite web|last1=Chait|first1=Jonathan|title=Mike Pence Says U.S. Intel Found That Russia Didn't Elect Trump.

On the other hand, a number of former intelligence and law enforcement officials, at least one political scientist and one former U.S. president argue that Russian interference was decisive because of the sophistication of the Russian propaganda on social media, the hacking of Democratic Party emails and the timing of their public release, the small shift in voter support needed to achieve victory in the electoral college, and the relatively high number of undecided voters (who may be more readily influenced).<ref name="Boot-wapo-24-7-18"/><ref name="econ"/><ref name="mayer-1-10-18"/> [[James Clapper]], the former director of National Intelligence, told [[Jane Mayer]], "it stretches credulity to think the Russians didn't turn the election{{nbsp}}...

Three states where Trump won by very close margins—margins significantly less than the number of votes cast for third party candidates in those states—gave him an electoral college majority. Mayer writes that if only 12% of these third-party voters "were persuaded by Russian propaganda—based on hacked Clinton-campaign analytics—not to vote for Clinton", this would have been enough to win the election for Trump.<ref name="mayer-1-10-18"/>
Political scientist [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]], in a [[Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President|detailed forensic analysis]] concludes that Russian trolls and hackers persuaded enough Americans "to either vote a certain way or not vote at all", thus impacting election results.<ref name="mayer-1-10-18"/><ref>{{cite interview |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-this-author-says-its-highly-probable-russian-interference-swung-the-2016-election |title=Why this author says it's 'highly probable' Russian interference swung the 2016 election |work=[[PBS Newshour]] |first=Kathleen Hall |last=Jamieson |author-link=Kathleen Hall Jamieson |interviewer=[[Judy Woodruff]] |date=November 1, 2018 |access-date=November 23, 2018}}</ref>
Specifically, Jamieson argues that two events that caused a drop in intention to vote for Clinton reported to pollsters can be traced to Russian work: the publicizing of excerpts of speeches by Clinton made to investment banks for high fees stolen from campaign emails during the presidential debates, and the effect of Russian disinformation on FBI head Comey's public denunciation of Clinton's actions as "extremely careless" (see [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections#Influence on FBI investigation of email server|above]]).<ref name="mayer-1-10-18"/>

In March 2018, [[Anastasia Vashukevich]], a Belarusian national arrested in Thailand, said she had over 16 hours of audio recordings that could shed light on possible Russian interference in American elections. She offered the recordings to American authorities in exchange for asylum, to avoid being extradited to Belarus.<ref name="Paddock030518">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/world/asia/nastya-rybka-trump-putin.html|title=Escort Says Audio Recordings Show Russian Meddling in U.S. Election|first=Richard C.|last=Paddock|date=March 5, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 5, 2018}}</ref> Vashukevich said she was close to [[Oleg Deripaska]], a Russian oligarch with ties to Putin and business links to [[Paul Manafort]], and asserted the recordings included Deripaska discussing the 2016 presidential election. She said some of the recorded conversations, which she asserted were made in August 2016, included three individuals who spoke fluent English and who she believed were Americans. Vashukevich's claims appeared to be consistent with a video published in February 2018 by [[Alexei Navalny]], about a meeting between Deripaska and Russian Deputy Prime Minister [[Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko]]. In the video, Navalny claims Deripaska served as a liaison between the Russian government and Paul Manafort in connection with Russian interference efforts.<ref name="Paddock030518"/>

== 2020 developments ==
On November 2, the Special Counsel's office released previously redacted portions of the Mueller report. In September, a federal judge ordered the passages disclosed in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) lawsuit filed by [[BuzzFeed News]] and the advocacy group [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]], while allowing other portions to remain redacted.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Leopold|first=Jason|last2=Bensinger|first2=Ken|title=New: Mueller Investigated Julian Assange, WikiLeaks, And Roger Stone For DNC Hacks|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/new-mueller-investigated-julian-assange-wikileaks-and-roger|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.buzzfeednews.com|language=en}}</ref> 

In summary, per Buzzfeed: "Although Wikileaks published emails stolen from the DNC in July and October 2016 and Stone — a close associate to Donald Trump — appeared to know in advance the materials were coming, investigators 'did not have sufficient evidence' to prove active participation in the hacks or knowledge that the electronic thefts were continuing. In addition, federal prosecutors could not establish that the hacked emails amounted to campaign contributions benefitting Trump’s election chances …"<ref name=":0" />

The newly released material also stated: "While the investigation developed evidence that the GRU’s hacking efforts in fact were continuing at least at the time of the July 2016 WikiLeaks dissemination, … the Office did not develop sufficient admissible evidence that WikiLeaks knew of — or even was willfully blind to — that fact." As reported by Buzzfeed, "Likewise, prosecutors faced what they called factual hurdles in pursuing Stone for the hack."<ref name=":0" />

On November 2, 2020, the day before the presidential election, ''New York'' magazine reported that:
{{quote|According to two sources familiar with the probe, there has been no evidence found, after 18 months of investigation, to support Barr's claims that Trump was targeted by politically biased Obama officials to prevent his election. (The probe remains ongoing.) In fact, the sources said, the Durham investigation has so far uncovered no evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden or Barack Obama, or that they were even involved with the Russia investigation. There 'was no evidence … not even remotely … indicating Obama or Biden did anything wrong,' as one person put it.<ref name="Waas_11/2/2020">{{cite web | last=Waas | first=Murray | title=How Trump and Barr's October Surprise Went Bust | website=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] | date=November 2, 2020 | url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/durham-investigation-how-trumps-october-surprise-went-bust.html | access-date=November 4, 2020}}</ref>}}{{clear}}

During the course of the 2016 presidential campaign and up to his inauguration, Donald J.

In June 2016, [[Christopher Steele]], a former [[MI6]] agent, was hired by [[Fusion GPS]] to produce opposition research on Donald Trump. In October 2015, before Steele was hired, Trump's republican political opponents had hired Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump. When they stopped their funding, Fusion GPS hired Steele to continue that research, but with more focus on Trump's Russian connections. In the beginning, he did not know the identities of Fusion GPS's ultimate clients, which were the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign. His reports, based on information provided by his witting and unwitting Russian sources and sources close to the Trump campaign, included alleged ''[[kompromat]]'' that may make Trump vulnerable to [[blackmail]] from Russia.

Donald Trump's tough stance toward Iran has been the main interests to Israeli right-wing government under Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], and thus Israel's tacit support for Russia has also been debated, due to warm relations between Israel and Russia after the 2016 U.S. elections, as well as being the two earliest leaders in the world to congratulate Trump.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-11-09/vladimir-putin-leads-the-pack-in-international-congratulations-to-president-elect-donald-trump</ref><ref>https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/russia-israel-putin-netanyahu-trump-obama-233078</ref><ref>https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2019/4/8/netanyahu-trump-and-putin-a-love-story/</ref> The Israeli Prime Minister had also been suspected of aiding Russia to hack the election.<ref>https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/how-netanyahu-helped-putin-hack-the-us-election-in-2016</ref>
