The [[Grammy Award]] for '''Best New Artist''' has been awarded since 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/10993760/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622050435/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/10993760|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 22, 2010|title=Just what is 'alternative'? - today > entertainment - Music - TODAY.com|work=TODAY.com|accessdate=February 23, 2016}}</ref> Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were handed out, for records released in the previous year. The award was not presented in 1967. The official guidelines are as follows: "For a new artist who releases, during the Eligibility Year, the first recording which establishes the public identity of that artist." Note that this is not necessarily the first album released by an artist.

It is sometimes asserted, with varying degrees of sincerity, that winning the award is a curse, as several award winners (particularly from the late 1970s and early 1980s) were never able to duplicate the success they experienced in their debut year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/clicktrack/2010/01/the_grammys_the_curse_of_the_b.html |work=The Washington Post |title=The Grammys: The curse of the Best New Artist award? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125200724/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/clicktrack/2010/01/the_grammys_the_curse_of_the_b.html |archivedate=January 25, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/6827316/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926145258/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/6827316/|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 26, 2012|title=And the winner is ... what's your name again?|work=TODAY.com|accessdate=February 23, 2016}}</ref> This viewpoint was expressed by former [[Starland Vocal Band]] member [[Taffy Nivert|Taffy Danoff]] in a 2002 interview for VH1's ''100 Greatest One Hit Wonders'': "We got two of the five Grammys – one was Best New Artist. So that was basically the kiss of death and I feel sorry for everyone who's gotten it since."<ref>{{cite video | people=Taffy Danoff (Interviewee) | date=2002 | url=http://www.tv.com/one-hit-wonders/vh1s-100-greatest-one-hit-wonders-hour-4/episode/291771/summary.html?tag=ep_list;ep_title;6 | title=VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders | medium=TV-Series | location=North America | publisher= [[VH1]]}}</ref>

The category is also notable for being the only one of its kind in which a Grammy Award was vacated. This occurred in 1990 after it was revealed winners [[Milli Vanilli]] did not contribute their own vocals on their debut album.<ref name=" revoked">{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-11-20-mn-4948-story.html|title=Milli Vanilli's Grammy Rescinded by Academy : Music: Organization revokes an award for the first time after the revelation that the duo never sang on the album.|date=1990-11-20|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> The award was revoked but was not handed out to another artist.

Of the 54 awards presented in the category since its inception, the honor has been presented to 26 solo female artists, 18 duos or groups, and 11 solo male artists. Between 1997 and 2003, all the winners were solo female artists. Also, from 1993 to 2005, no winner was a solo male artist. In 2006, [[John Legend]] broke this trend, which started after [[Marc Cohn]] in 1992. Only five artists have won both Best New Artist and [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] in the same year: [[Bob Newhart]] in 1961, [[Christopher Cross]] in 1981, [[Lauryn Hill]] in 1999, [[Norah Jones]] in 2003, and [[Billie Eilish]] in 2020. Of these, Cross, Jones, and Eilish had songs winning [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for the same year, with Cross as the sole songwriter, Eilish as co-writer, and Jones lacking songwriting credit, which therefore made her miss out on completing the single year big four Grammy achievement, a feat that only Cross and Eilish attained. Only two artists have ''lost'' Best New Artist yet won Album of the Year in the same year: [[Vaughn Meader]] in 1963 and [[Alanis Morissette]] in 1996.

Of all the winners, only one ([[Esperanza Spalding]]) has been a [[Jazz music|jazz]] artist<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110713001210/http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/112385/20110215/spalding-has-made-history-in-winning-best-new-artist-award.htm Spalding has made history for winning best new artist award - Entertainment & Stars]</ref> and only three have been [[Country music|country]] artists. In 1997, [[LeAnn Rimes]] became the first country artist to win the award, as well as being the youngest artist to win the award (at the age of 14).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8548674/grammy-best-new-artist-winners-record-holders|title=Grammy Best New Artist Winners: 26 Record-Holders, From Youngest to Oldest to First Award Taken Back |first=Paul|last=Grein|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 25, 2020|work=Billboard|publisher=Billboard}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQ4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA67 |title=''Billboard'' Magazine.

[[David Crosby]] and [[Carl Palmer]] hold the unique distinction of being the only artists to be nominated twice for this award.

1984 marked the first time that all of the nominees were from outside the United States (Winner [[Culture Club]], [[Eurythmics]], and [[Musical Youth]] were from England, [[Big Country]] was from Scotland, and [[Men Without Hats]] were from Canada).<ref name=Grammy1984>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CQcPAAAAIBAJ&pg=7099,3741679&dq=grammy+nominee+best-new-artist&hl=en|title=Jackson dominates Grammy list|date=February 24, 1984|accessdate=April 24, 2010|first=Chuck|last=Gates|work=Deseret News|publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company}}</ref>

==Process==
Members of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] nominate their choices for the best new artist. A list of the top twenty artists is given to the Nominations Review Committee, a specially selected group of anonymous members, who initially selected the top five artists to gain a nomination in the category in a special ballot; the number of nominated artists was increased to eight in 2018.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/print/1999/feb/21/entertainment/ca-10032 Behind Grammy's Closed Door]</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Aswad|first=Jem|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/grammys-expand-major-category-nominations-best-album-song-record-new-artist-from-five-to-eight-1202858025/|title=Grammys Expand Major Category Nominations From Five to Eight|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2018-06-28 |accessdate=2018-12-09}}</ref> The rest of the members then vote on a winner from the final nominees.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wyman |first=Bill |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2284690/pagenum/all/#p2 |title=The Grammys: the secret committee that alters the membership's nominations |publisher=Slate.com |date=February 11, 2011 |accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref>

==Rules changes==
Over the years, the eligibility rules for this category have changed several times. In 2010, [[Lady Gaga]]'s exclusion from the Best New Artist category caused the [[Recording Academy]] to change eligibility requirements for the next ceremony. She was ineligible for the nomination because her hit "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" had been nominated in 2008. The new rule stated that an artist can be nominated as long as that artist has not previously released an entire [[Music album|album]] and has subsequently not won a Grammy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/38126004/ns/today-entertainment/t/grammys-change-rules-best-new-artist/#.TpL7X5v222A|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120719145726/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/38126004/ns/today-entertainment/t/grammys-change-rules-best-new-artist/%23.TpL7X5v222A|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 19, 2012|title=Grammys change rules for best new artist|quote=Eligibility change was caused by Lady Gaga's exclusion|date=July 7, 2010|accessdate=October 10, 2010|publisher=[[MSN Music]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jul/08/lady-gaga-change-grammy-rules|first=Sean|last=Michaels|title=Lady Gaga snub prompts change in Grammy rules|quote=Eligibility rules for best new artist category revised following exclusion of the dance-pop diva last year|date=July 8, 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 10, 2011|location=London}}</ref> In June 2016, the Grammy organization amended the Best New Artist rules once again, to remove the album barrier “given current trends in how new music and developing artists are released and promoted”.<ref>[https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/the-recording-academy-announces-rule-amendments-and-dates-for-the Press Release, 16 June 2016]</ref> To be eligible in the category of Best New Artist, the artist, duo, or group:

* Must have released a minimum of five singles/tracks or one album (until 2020 there was a maximum of 30 singles/tracks or three albums, but this maximum limit was removed for the 2021 awards season)
* May not have entered into this category more than three times, including as a performing member of an established group.
* Must have achieved a breakthrough into the public consciousness and impacted the musical landscape during the eligibility period.

These new rules were put on effect starting with the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards]]. The category was expanded to include eight nominees in [[61st Annual Grammy Awards|2019]].<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/recording-academy-announces-61st-grammy-awards-update Recording Academy Announces 61st GRAMMY Awards Update]</ref> From 2021, the screening committees will be charged with determining whether the artist had attained a breakthrough or prominence prior to the eligibility year. Such a determination would result in disqualification.<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/recording-academy-announces-changes-63rd-annual-grammys-releases-rules-and-guidelines Grammy.com, 10 June 2020[</ref>
