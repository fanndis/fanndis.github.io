Before this scandal came to light, U.S. president [[Donald Trump]] indicated he would accept foreign intelligence on his political rivals. In June 2019, Trump was interviewed by [[George Stephanopoulos]], who asked: "If foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you information on an opponent, should they accept it or should they call the FBI?" Trump responded: "I think maybe you do both. I think you might want to listen. I don't. There's nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country—Norway—we have information on your opponent. Oh. I think I'd want to hear it."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/02/politics/foreign-dirt-campaigns-trump/index.html|title=Trump has already said he's OK working with foreign governments against his U.S. rivals|last1=Wolf|first1=Zachary B.|date=October 2, 2019|access-date=October 4, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003022005/https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/02/politics/foreign-dirt-campaigns-trump/index.html|archive-date=October 3, 2019|publisher=CNN}}</ref> After Trump said this, the chair of the Federal Election Commission, Ellen Weintraub, reminded Americans that according to federal law: "It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/03/fec-chair-subtweets-trump-after-plea-for-china-to-investigate-bidens.html|title=FEC chair tweets reminder that accepting foreign help in an election is illegal after Trump urges China to investigate Joe Biden|last1=Higgins|first1=Tucker|date=October 3, 2019|access-date=October 6, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191004130109/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/03/fec-chair-subtweets-trump-after-plea-for-china-to-investigate-bidens.html|archive-date=October 4, 2019|publisher=[[CNBC]]}}</ref> Previously in July 2016, while Trump was still a candidate in the [[2016 United States presidential election]], he [[Timeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections (July 2016–election day)#20160727|made a request]]: "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|30,000 emails that are missing]]" from 2016 Democratic presidential candidate [[Hillary Clinton]]'s email server.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ukraine-if-youre-listening--how-trump-tries-to-quell-controversies-by-saying-the-quiet-part-out-loud/2019/09/20/8e68aad0-dbc1-11e9-adff-79254db7f766_story.html|title=Ukraine, if you're listening ...: How Trump tries to quell controversies by saying the quiet part out loud|last1=Parker|first1=Ashley|date=September 20, 2019|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=October 4, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190921034234/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ukraine-if-youre-listening--how-trump-tries-to-quell-controversies-by-saying-the-quiet-part-out-loud/2019/09/20/8e68aad0-dbc1-11e9-adff-79254db7f766_story.html|archive-date=September 21, 2019|url-access=limited}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://time.com/5573539/trump-clinton-russia-hack-joke/|title=President Trump Told Mueller He Was Just Joking When He Asked Russia to Hack Hillary Clinton|last=Dowd|first=Kathy Erich|date=April 18, 2019|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=October 6, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418215338/https://time.com/5573539/trump-clinton-russia-hack-joke/|archive-date=April 18, 2019}}</ref>

Shokin asserted in the statement that Biden actually had him fired because he refused to stop his investigation into Burisma. Giuliani, who asserts he has "nothing to do with" and has "never met or talked to" Firtash, has promoted the statement in television appearances as purported evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.

=== Kashyap Patel ===

Kashyap Patel was a national security aide for the [[House Intelligence Committee]], under [[Congressman Nunes]] (R, CA.) during the first years of the Trump administration. He was the key author of a [[nunes memo|controversial memo]] which was central to the Republican narrative that FBI and DOJ officials inappropriately obtained FISA warrants for several of Trump campaign staffers, including [[Carter Page]].<ref name=patel-early>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/politics/kashyap-patel-nunes-memo.html |title=Kashyap Patel, Main Author of Secret Memo, Is No Stranger to Quarrels |first1=Katie |last1=Rogers |first2=Matthew |last2=Rosenberg |date=February 2, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=October 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name=patel-ukraine>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/us/politics/kash-patel-ukraine.html|title=White House Aides Feared That Trump Had Another Ukraine Back Channel |first1=Julian E. |last1=Barnes |first2=Adam |last2=Goldman |first3=Nicholas |last3=Fandos |date=October 23, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=October 25, 2019 }}</ref> Weeks later, the memo was deemed biased, consisting of "cherry picked facts".<ref name=patel-ukraine/> After the leadership changeover in of the House of Representatives, Patel was hired as a staffer for President Trump's National Security Council.

In a July 26 memo, the whistleblower reported, "The official stated that there was already a conversation underway with White House lawyers about how to handle the discussion because, in the official's view, the president had clearly committed a criminal act by urging a foreign power to investigate a U.S. person for the purposes of advancing his own re-election bid in 2020."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/trump-ukraine-whistleblower.html|title=Trump's Ukraine Call Was 'Crazy' and 'Frightening', Official Told Whistle-Blower|last=Fandos|first=Nicholas|date=October 8, 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=October 8, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20191009020331/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/trump-ukraine-whistleblower.html|archive-date=October 9, 2019|url-access=limited}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-whistleblower-complaint-read-full-text-whistleblower-memo-trump-ukraine-call-described-cbs-news-exclusive/|title=Read the whistleblower's memo about Trump's Ukraine call, as described to CBS News|last=Farhi|first=Arden|date=October 9, 2019|access-date=October 9, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191013032007/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-whistleblower-complaint-read-full-text-whistleblower-memo-trump-ukraine-call-described-cbs-news-exclusive/|archive-date=October 13, 2019|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}</ref>

In the messages, Taylor wrote: "I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign."

Both attorney general Bill Barr and White House counsel [[Pat Cipollone]] had recommended Trump publicly release the memorandum, asserting it showed the president did nothing wrong. During ensuing days, Trump and his allies strongly encouraged the public to read the "transcript", even as the consensus view of legal analysts was that the memorandum implicated rather than exonerated the president. Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney advised Trump that releasing the memorandum had been a mistake, causing the president to become irked by the advice Barr had given him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/us/politics/trump-william-barr.html|title=Impeachment Inquiry Tests Ties Between Barr and Trump|first1=Peter|last1=Baker|first2=Katie|last2=Benner|first3=Maggie|last3=Haberman|date=November 7, 2019|work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=November 19, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://apnews.com/f535a9d692b747a4b1b038e5502883d9 |first1=Hope |last1=Yen |first2=Calvin |last2=Woodward |title=AP FACT CHECK: Trump's 'read the transcript' impeachment cry|date=November 9, 2019|agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=November 19, 2019 }}</ref>

During an October 17 press conference, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said he "was involved with the process" of the freezing of military aid. Mulvaney gave his account of why Trump decided to hold back military aid to Ukraine. One, Trump felt the other European countries were not doing enough. Two, Trump felt Ukraine was a "corrupt place" which included having "corruption related to the DNC server" with regard to "what happened in 2016". As a result, reporter [[Jonathan Karl]] told Mulvaney "what you just described is a ''quid pro quo''. It is: 'Funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.'" Mulvaney replied to Karl: "We do that all the time with foreign policy{{nbsp}}... Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy." Later in the press conference, Mulvaney quoted a third reason on why military aid was frozen—they had yet to cooperate with a U.S. Justice Department investigation into alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.<ref name=becket>{{cite news |last1=Becket |first1=Stefan |last2=Segers |first2=Grace |last3=Watson |first3=Kathryn |title=Mulvaney links delay in Ukraine aid to DOJ investigation into 2016—live updates |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/trump-impeachment-inquiry-latest-kurt-volker-gordon-sondland-testimony-2019-10-17/ |access-date=October 31, 2019 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=October 18, 2019}}</ref><ref name="getoverit">{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mulvaney-acknowledges-trump-held-ukraine-aid-political-reasons-get-over-n1068256 |access-date=December 12, 2019 |title=Mulvaney acknowledges Trump held up Ukraine aid for political reasons: 'Get over it'|last=Smith|first=Allan|date=October 17, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20191024095917/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mulvaney-acknowledges-trump-held-ukraine-aid-political-reasons-get-over-n1068256|archive-date=October 24, 2019|publisher=[[NBC News]]}}</ref>

On January 16, 2020, the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), a non-partisan watchdog agency, concluded that the White House broke federal law by withholding of Congress-approved military aid to Ukraine. The agency concluded that the [[Impoundment Control Act of 1974]] had been violated because Congress' legislated policy had been supplanted by President Trump's own policy. The agency also concluded that the withholding "was not a programmatic delay", in spite of the Trump administration's claim that it was so.<ref name="NYT-Cochrane">{{cite news |last1=Cochrane |first1=Emily |last2=Lipton |first2=Eric |last3=Cameron |first3=Chris |title=G.A.O.

=== Withholding of White House visit ===

In a May 2019 letter congratulating Zelensky on his election, Trump raised the possibility of a White House visit. However, during the next few months as Giuliani and some State Department officials pressed Zelensky to investigate Burisma and the 2016 election, a White House visit became one of the inducements offered or withheld depending on Zelensky's cooperation.<ref name="grauniad-diplomats-zelenskiy">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/04/us-diplomats-told-zelenskiy-ukraine-trump-visit-was-dependent-on-biden-statement-text-investigation |title=U.S. diplomats told Zelenskiy Trump visit was dependent on Biden statement |last1=Borger |first1=Julian |date=October 4, 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=November 11, 2019 |last2=Gambino |first2=Lauren }}</ref>

[[William B. Taylor Jr.|Bill Taylor]], the United States' senior diplomatic official in [[Ukraine]], testified in a congressional hearing that he learned in mid-July 2019 that a potential White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky "was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections".<ref name=bade/>

[[Gordon Sondland]], the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who became Trump's primary connection to Ukraine, testified that Trump had told him he was "skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption" and directed him to speak to Giuliani about his concerns. Sondland began working with Giuliani and conveyed the message about investigations to the Ukrainians.<ref name="grauniad-diplomats-zelenskiy"/> In August, Sondland texted that the White House visit would be scheduled just as soon as Zelensky confirmed that he would issue a public statement about investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election.<ref name="wapo texts show"/> In his November 20 testimony before the [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|impeachment hearings]], Sondland testified that the White House visit was conditioned on a public Ukrainian announcement of investigation into Burisma and the 2016 election, which he described as a ''quid pro quo''.<ref name="Edelman"/>

In testimony before congressional committees, the National Security Council's head of European Affairs, Lieutenant Colonel [[Alexander Vindman]], testified that Sondland had told Ukrainian officials in his presence that they would have to launch investigations into the Bidens in order to get a meeting with Trump. He said Sondland indicated that "everything"—including the military aid and the White House visit—was on the table pending Zelensky's public announcement of such an investigation.<ref name="nbc vindman"/>

Roughly an hour after Pompeo's letter was received, the [[Inspector General of the Department of State|State Department inspector general]] [[Steve Linick]] requested an "urgent" meeting with several House committees the next day, relating to documents on Ukraine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-impeachment-inquiry-10-01-2019/index.html|title=The latest on the Trump impeachment inquiry|date=October 1, 2019|publisher=[[CNN]] |first1=Meg |last1=Wagner |first2=Mike |last2=Hayes |first3=Veronica |last3=Rocha |access-date=October 4, 2019 }}</ref> After the meeting, Democrats said Linick had provided a "package of disinformation, debunked conspiracy theories and baseless allegations in an envelope marked 'White House' and containing folders labeled "Trump Hotel{{'"}}.

Among the allegations in the documents was that [[Marie Yovanovitch]], the American ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled in May 2019, had been installed by George Soros. The materials had reportedly arrived at the State department in spring 2019 and Linick had passed them on to the FBI.

The House also sought testimony from [[Gordon Sondland]], the ambassador to the European Union, whose text messages revealed his involvement with Ukrainian officials in arranging a meeting with Trump.

On October 8, the [[White House Counsel|White House counsel]] Pat Cipollone sent an eight-page letter to Pelosi and other Democratic leaders, saying the Trump administration would refuse to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. The letter asserted that the inquiry was "constitutionally invalid" and "violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent" and objected to the inquiry's procedure.

When notified of her removal, Sullivan assured her that she had done nothing wrong and was not being recalled for cause.

[[George P. Kent|George Kent]], a career United States diplomat, met with impeachment investigators on October 15, 2019, even though the State Department ordered him not to testify and tried to limit his testimony. He is currently the number two diplomat in the [[Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs]] and has much experience in the U.S. State Department's anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine dating back to 2014. Beginning in March 2019, Kent expressed misgivings to colleagues about the pressure being applied to Ukraine by President Trump and Giuliani to carry out official inquiries into Trump's political adversaries.<ref name=vogel-kent/> Kent also directed attention to Giuliani's "disinformation" operation which planned to enroll a Ukrainian prosecutor to slander Trump opponents: Joseph Biden, Marie Yovanovitch, and Ukrainians believed to have circulated harmful information about [[Paul Manafort]], Trump's campaign chairman, during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.<ref name="vogel-kent">{{Cite news |access-date=January 7, 2020 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/politics/impeachment-george-kent-state.html|title=Senior State Dept.

Internal emails submitted by the State Department's inspector general show Kent criticizing a "fake news smear" about Yovanovitch, which were touted by conservative broadcasting commentators linked with Trump. In another email, he disapproved of the Ukrainian prosecutor who was circulating allegations about Yovanovitch and said they were "complete poppycock".<ref name=vogel-kent/> He also testified that, after a May 2019 meeting arranged by [[Mick Mulvaney]], he was mostly excluded from decisions about Ukraine policymaking, calling his exclusion by President Trump's insiders—Gordon Sondland, Kurt Volker, and [[Rick Perry]]—as "wrong". The three "declared themselves the three people now responsible for Ukraine policy".<ref name="vogel-kent"/> At certain times, Kent was told to "lay low" on matters regarding Ukraine.

In reference to Joe and Hunter Biden, those familiar with his testimony said Kent told investigators that as early as 2015 he had attempted to voice concerns about the then–vice president's son sitting on the board of the Ukrainian energy company [[Burisma Holdings]].

[[Gordon D. Sondland]], the United States ambassador to Europe,<ref name=vogel-kent/> is believed by some to have been at the heart of efforts to pressure Ukraine. He met with impeachment investigators on October 17. In his testimony, Sondland criticized Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating a political rival.

On October 22, 2019, [[William B. Taylor Jr.|William Taylor]], the United States' senior diplomatic official in [[Ukraine]], testified to congressional investigators. Taylor testified that he had learned in mid-July 2019 that a potential White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky "was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections", and that he later was told, in September 2019, that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was also dependent on such investigations—including into the Bidens.<ref name=bade>{{Cite news |last1=Bade |first1=Rachael |last2=Gearan |first2=Anne |last3=Demirjan |first3=Karoun |last4=DeBonis |first4=Mike |title=Trump made Ukraine aid contingent on public pledge to investigate Bidens and 2016 election, U.S. envoy says he was told |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/diplomat-who-raised-alarm-about-withholding-aid-to-ukraine-testifies-in-impeachment-probe/2019/10/22/086fb850-f436-11e9-8cf0-4cc99f74d127_story.html |access-date=October 28, 2019 |date=October 22, 2019 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Wu |first1=Nicholas |last2=Jansen |first2=Bart |title=Key takeaways from Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor's 'explosive' opening statement |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/22/impeachment-takeaways-ukraine-diplomat-bill-taylors-testimony/2450332001/ |access-date=October 24, 2019 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=October 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Faulders |first1=Katherine |title=Top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine tells Congress investigating Bidens and election interference tied to aid money |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-us-diplomat-ukraine-tells-congress-investigating-bidens/story?id=66451155 |access-date=October 24, 2019 |agency=[[ABC News]] |date=October 22, 2019}}</ref>

Taylor testified that other than the "regular, formal diplomatic processes" to Ukraine led by himself, there was a "highly irregular", "informal channel of U.S. policy-making" with regard to Ukraine. The informal channel began in May 2019, being "guided" by Rudy Giuliani, and also involving Kurt Volker, Gordon Sondland and Rick Perry. Taylor said that by August 2019 he had realized that the informal channel "was running contrary to the goals of longstanding U.S. policy", while the formal channel wanted "a strong U.S.–Ukraine partnership". According to Taylor, the informal channel had "driven" the idea of a White House meeting between the presidents being conditional on the investigations.<ref name=":3b"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Jaffe |first1=Greg |last2=Miller |first2=Greg |title='Alarming circumstances': A distressed diplomat tells a tale of venal intrigue |date=October 23, 2019 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/alarming-circumstances-a-distressed-diplomat-tells-a-tale-of-venal-intrigue/2019/10/22/935b23c6-f500-11e9-ad8b-85e2aa00b5ce_story.html |access-date=October 24, 2019 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

Taylor noted that for a June 2019 call between himself, Zelensky, Sondland, Volker and Perry, Sondland had said that "he did not wish to include most of the regular interagency participants" and that "he wanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring". As for Trump's July 2019 call with Zelensky, Taylor said he did not receive any report regarding the call from the White House even though he was scheduled to meet Zelensky a day later.<ref name=":3b"/>

Taylor said he heard from National Security Council aide Tim Morrison that on September 1, Sondland told Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak that the military aid to Ukraine was dependent on Zelensky's pursuit of the Burisma investigation. Taylor cited Sondland's telling him in a call that Trump wanted Zelensky to publicly announce he would order the two investigations, thus placing Zelensky "in a public box". Taylor quoted Sondland stating "everything" including military aid and a Trump–Zelensky meeting was contingent on that announcement.<ref name=":3b">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/us/politics/william-taylor-testimony.html |title=6 Key Revelations of Taylor's Opening Statement to Impeachment Investigators |last=LaFraniere |first=Sharon |author-link=Sharon LaFraniere |date=October 22, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=October 23, 2019|url-access=limited}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=5 takeaways from William Taylor's huge opening statement |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/22/takeaways-bill-taylors-crucial-opening-statement/ |access-date=October 24, 2019 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 23, 2019}}</ref>

Lieutenant Colonel [[Alexander Vindman|Alexander S. Vindman]] served on the National Security Council. On October 29, 2019, he testified before a closed session of the [[House intelligence committee|House Intelligence Committee]], [[House Foreign Affairs Committee|Foreign Affairs]], and [[House Oversight Committee|Oversight]] Committees. In his opening statement, he said, "In Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false and alternative narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency" that was "harmful to U.S. national security" and which "undermined U.S. government efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine".<ref name="nbc vindman">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/read-national-security-official-alexander-s-vindman-s-prepared-remarks-n1073156 |date=October 29, 2019 |title=Read national security official Alexander S.

Vindman also said that he was concerned by two events he found objectionable and which he mentioned to senior officials at the time, as well as to the National Security Council's lead attorney.{{cn|date=November 2019}}

The first event occurred at a July 10 meeting between Ukraine's then [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine|secretary of national security and defense council]] [[Oleksandr Danylyuk|Oleksandr Danlylyuk]], and then [[National Security Advisor (United States)|U.S. national security advisor]] [[John Bolton]], which ambassadors [[Kurt Volker|Volker]] and [[Gordon Sondland|Sondland]], and Energy Secretary [[Rick Perry]] attended. At this meeting, Sondland asked Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens as a condition of meeting with President Trump. Vindman said Bolton cut the meeting short, and that both he and Fiona Hill told Ambassador Sondland his comments were inappropriate and that he reported his concerns to the NSC's lead counsel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/us/politics/Alexander-Vindman-trump-impeachment.html|title=Army Officer Who Heard Trump's Ukraine Call Reported Concerns|last=Hakim|first=Danny|date=October 28, 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=October 29, 2019}}</ref>

The second event occurred on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky when Trump directly asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens in exchange for military aid. Vindman said, "I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine, and the potential to undermine U.S. national security."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/white-house-official-to-tell-impeachment-investigators-he-feared-trumps-demands-of-ukraine-would-undermine-national-security/2019/10/28/0fc8ab46-f9f1-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html|title=White House official to tell impeachment investigators he feared Trump's demands of Ukraine would undermine national security|last=Jaffe|first=Greg|date=October 28, 2019|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=October 29, 2019}}</ref>

==== Tim Morrison ====

Tim Morrison, an official on the National Security Council, testified in a closed-door session on October 31. Morrison corroborated previous testimony by William Taylor, stating that Taylor had been "accurate" on the "substance" of their conversations, but there were two differences in the details, the first being a location of a meeting. Regarding the second difference, Morrison testified that in his September 1, 2019, conversation with Sondland, he learned that Sondland had proposed to Ukrainian presidential advisor Andriy Yermak that military aid to Ukraine was "conditioned on a public statement" by the new Ukrainian prosecutor general reopening an investigation into Burisma (Taylor's testimony was that Zelensky should make the announcement).<ref name=Leonnig-191031/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Fandos |first1=Nicholas |title=White House Aide Confirms He Saw Signs of a Quid Pro Quo on Ukraine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/morrison-testimony-impeachment.html |access-date=November 3, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20191031192539/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/morrison-testimony-impeachment.html |archive-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=House |first1=Billy |title=White House Aide Tells House of Concerns Over Trump and Ukraine |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-11-01/white-house-aide-tells-house-of-concerns-over-trump-and-ukraine |access-date=November 3, 2019 |agency=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=October 31, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Treene |first1=Alayna |last2=Ayesh |first2=Rashaan |title=Former White House official confirms top Ukraine diplomat's testimony |url=https://www.axios.com/white-house-tim-morrison-diplomat-testimony-c77aa24b-ccf6-46f0-bad5-199d45e434e7.html |access-date=November 3, 2019 |work=[[Axios (website)|Axios]] |date=November 1, 2019}}</ref>

In his public testimony, [[Kurt Volker]] amended his earlier private comments, saying that since then "I have learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question."

<blockquote>[T]he impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection. In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump's domestic political opponent. In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine.

The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security.

At the center of this investigation is the memorandum prepared following President Trump's July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine's President, which the White House declassified and released under significant public pressure. The call record alone is stark evidence of misconduct; a demonstration of the President's prioritization of his personal political benefit over the national interest. In response to President Zelensky's appreciation for vital U.S. military assistance, which President Trump froze without explanation, President Trump asked for "a favor though": two specific investigations designed to assist his reelection efforts.<ref name="Intel-Report"/>{{Rp|8-9}}</blockquote>

=== Actions of first whistleblower ===

Various right-wing commentators speculated the whistleblower had help from others, perhaps constituting a coordinated conspiracy.

He then contacted an aide for the House Intelligence Committee and provided a vague statement. The aide then followed standard procedure and advised the whistleblower to find a lawyer and file a complaint with the Intelligence Community inspector Ggeneral (IC IG). Neither Rep.
