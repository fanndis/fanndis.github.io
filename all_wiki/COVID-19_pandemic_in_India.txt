On 22 March, India observed a 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the insistence of Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]]. It was followed by mandatory lockdowns in COVID-19 hotspots and all major cities. Further, on 24 March, the prime minister ordered a [[COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India|nationwide lockdown]] for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3{{nbsp}}billion population of India. On 14 April, India extended the nationwide lockdown till 3 May which was followed by two-week extensions starting 3 and 17 May with substantial relaxations. From 1 June, the government started "unlocking" the country (barring "containment zones") in three [[COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India|unlock]] phases.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Withnall|first1=Adam|date=24 March 2020|title=India to go into nationwide lockdown|website=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown-modi-speech-cases-update-news-a9421491.html}}</ref><ref name="lockdownext">

In March, after the lockdown was imposed, the United Nations (UN) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) praised India's response to the pandemic as 'comprehensive and robust', terming the lockdown restrictions as 'aggressive but vital' for containing the spread and building necessary healthcare infrastructure. At the same time, the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) noted the government's swift and stringent actions, emergency policy-making, emergency investment in health care, fiscal stimulus, and investment in vaccine and drug [[Research and development|R&D]] and gave India a score of 100 for the strict response. Also in March, [[Michael J. Ryan (doctor)|Michael Ryan]], chief executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme noted that India had tremendous capacity to deal with the outbreak owing to its vast experience in eradicating [[smallpox]] and [[polio]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=COVID-19: WHO calls India's lockdown 'comprehensive and robust', UN expresses solidarity|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2020/mar/25/covid-19-who-calls-indias-lockdown-comprehensive-and-robust-un-expresses-solidarity-2121361.html|access-date=5 June 2020|website=The New Indian Express}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=11 April 2020|title=India Corona news: India beats other nations in Covid response: Study|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-beats-other-nations-in-covid-response-study/articleshow/75089755.cms|work=The Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=10 April 2020|title=India scores high on Covid-19 response tracker made by Oxford University|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-scores-high-on-covid-19-response-tracker-made-by-oxford-university-1665573-2020-04-10|work=India Today}}</ref> In June, India was ranked 56th of 200 countries in COVID-19 safety assessment report by Deep Knowledge Group.<ref>{{cite report |title=COVID-19 Regional Safety Assessment |url=http://analytics.dkv.global/covid-regional-assessment-200-regions/full-report.pdf|publisher=Deep Knowledge Group|access-date=11 June 2020}}</ref> Other commentators have raised concerns about the [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in India|economic fallout]] arising as a result of the pandemic and preventive restrictions.<ref name="HT Jayati Ghosh2">{{cite web|date=28 March 2020|title='Unprecedented crisis; do whatever it takes': Jayati Ghosh on Covid-19|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unprecedented-crisis-do-whatever-it-takes-jayati-ghosh-on-covid-19/story-i9tPVvFhAs1d1Ud6uEYN4L.html|access-date=2 May 2020|website=Hindustan Times}}</ref><ref name="CEPR2">{{cite web|last1=Ray|first1=Debraj|last2=Subramanian|first2=S.|last3=Vandewalle|first3=Lore|date=9 April 2020|title=India's Lockdown|url=https://www.theindiaforum.in/article/indias-lockdown|website=The India Forum|quote=But in societies like India, a lockdown kill: via job loss, increased vulnerability to economic shocks, and via social stigma and misinformation.

The pandemic has left a severe impact on Indian economy, leading to a negative growth rate for the first time in decades. Nevertheless, the economy started to rebound after the lockdown was eased. Increased requirement for consumption had led the government and private firms to repurpose their factories and production lines for manufacturing of more hospital beds, PPE and ventilators. India emerged as the world's second largest manufacturer of PPE during the pandemic. The Union Government also launched a major [[Atmanirbhar Bharat|self-sufficiency campaign]] to substitute imported products with domestically produced counterparts, especially to replace goods imported from China.<ref name=":442">{{Cite web|last1=Misra|first1=Udit|date=13 May 2020|title=PM Modi's self-reliant India Mission economic package: Here is the fine print|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/narendra-modi-coronavirus-economic-package-india-self-reliance-6406939/|url-status=live|access-date=21 October 2020|website=The Indian Express}}</ref>

The Ministry of Health said that only 10 per cent of test capacity had been used per day till 15 March,<ref name=":6" /> claiming that the number of tests was enough.

====Expansion of tests====
On 17 March, the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare|Union Ministry of Health]] had decided to allow private pathology labs to test for COVID-19. The ministry official claimed that by allowing private labs, the work of testing can be doubled. The ministry said that [[National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories]] (NABL) accredited laboratories may soon be allowed.<ref name=":7">{{cite web |title=Metropolis among private labs short-listed for coronavirus testing| url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/metropolis-among-private-labs-short-listed-for-coronavirus-testing/article31090208.ece|website=The Hindu}}</ref> Once set up, a person can get COVID-19 test done at a private lab after a qualified physician in a government facility recommends it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Health Ministry to allow accredited private labs to conduct tests for coronavirus|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/health-ministry-to-allow-accredited-private-labs-to-conduct-tests-for-coronavirus-814595.html|website=Deccan Herald|date=17 March 2020}}</ref> The ICMR has appealed to the private labs to offer the tests for free as the government labs do.<ref name=":7" />

On 19 March, Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the [[Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy]] stated that India could be facing a "tsunami of cases within a few weeks" as testing increases and the reason for the low number of confirmed cases currently is due to under-testing. He also said that according to mathematical models applied in the US or UK at least 20%–60% of the population will be affected. Applying the same models in India means that at the lower end of the estimate there could be 300&nbsp;million cases of which 4–8{{nbsp}}million could be severe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-india-51962813/india-must-prepare-for-a-tsunami-of-coronavirus-cases|title=India must prepare for a tsunami of cases|date=19 March 2020|work=BBC|accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref>
