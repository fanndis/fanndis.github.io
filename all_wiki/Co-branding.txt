'''Co-branding''' is a [[marketing strategy]] that involves [[strategic alliance]] of multiple brand names jointly used on a single product or service.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=An analysis of B2B ingredient co-branding relationships|url=https://questrompublish.bu.edu/ssrini/IMM2008.pdf|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|volume=37|issue=8|pages=940|doi=10.1016/j.indmarman.2007.07.002|year=2008|last1=Erevelles|first1=Sunil|last2=Stevenson|first2=Thomas H|last3=Srinivasan|first3=Shuba|last4=Fukawa|first4=Nobuyuki}}</ref>

Co-branding is an arrangement that associates a single [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] with more than one [[brand name]], or otherwise associates a product with someone other than the principal producer. The typical co-branding agreement involves two or more companies acting in cooperation to associate any of various logos, color schemes, or brand identifiers to a specific product that is contractually designated for this purpose. The object for this is to combine the strength of two brands, in order to increase the premium consumers are willing to pay, make the product or service more resistant to copying by [[private label]] manufacturers, or to combine the different perceived properties associated with these brands with a single product.

An early instance of co-branding occurred in 1956 when [[Renault]] had Jacques Arpels of jewelers [[Van Cleef and Arpels]] turn the dashboard of one of their newly introduced [[Renault Dauphine|Dauphine]]s into a work of art.<ref name="cafe">{{cite web|url=http://www.caferestaurantdauphine.nl/en/geschiedenis/|title=History|publisher=Cafe Restaurant Dauphine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209042731/http://www.caferestaurantdauphine.nl/en/geschiedenis|archive-date=9 February 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=13 July 2010}}</ref>

Co-branding (also called brand partnership)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schmoozyfox.com/2010/03/brand-partnerships/|title=Brand partnerships – SCHMOOZY FOX|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403054404/http://www.schmoozyfox.com/2010/03/brand-partnerships/|archive-date=3 April 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=24 March 2010}}</ref> as described in ''Co-Branding: The Science of Alliance,'' is when two companies form an [[Brand alliances|alliance]] to work together thus creating marketing synergy.<ref name="customersandcapital.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.customersandcapital.com/book/2007/09/co-branding-tra.html|title=Competing for Customers and Capital|work=Southwest Airlines: Put a Little LUV in Your Logo!|publisher=customersandcapital.com}}</ref>

== Digital co-branding ==
Digital co-branding is a [[digital marketing strategy]] which follows the basics of co-branding, but aligns advertiser's brand with digital publisher that has the same target audience. Publishing platform would have to give up some editorial control to activate content for advertiser's brand. Travel websites are more open to building co-branding programs. They engage their audience in every process throughout the booking process. For example, snow update website features its ad on ski resorts website. If the co-branding ad placed is relevant and engaging, it is more effective than a normal internet ad. It helps the advertiser to connect and interact with more consumers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Co-Branding: The Anti-Programmatic Buying Strategy|url=https://adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/digital-co-branding-the-anti-programmatic-buying-strategy/|website=adexchanger|date=24 June 2013}}</ref>

For example, [[The Huffington Post]] have partnered with [[Johnson & Johnson]] on topics like ''woman and children'' written by Huffington Post independent reporters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sponsors Now Pay for Online Articles, Not Just Ads|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/business/media/sponsors-now-pay-for-online-articles-not-just-ads.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 April 2013|last1=Vega|first1=Tanzina}}</ref>

[[Digital co-branding]] should be carried out along with Programmatic buying to be more efficient and effective in Digital Media Marketing Campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Co-Branding: The Anti-Programmatic Buying Strategy|url=https://adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/digital-co-branding-the-anti-programmatic-buying-strategy/|website=adexchanger|date=24 June 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Classification of Co-Branding.jpg|thumb]]
The two types of co-branding are '''Product-based co-branding''' and '''Communications based co-branding'''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Marketing|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|edition=8th}}</ref>

== Product-based co-branding ==
'''Product-based co-branding''' is a marketing strategy that involves linking of multiple brands from different companies in order to create a product indicative of their individual identities.

== Intent ==

According to Chang, from the ''[[Journal of American Academy of Business]]'', Cambridge, there are three levels of co-branding: [[market share]], [[brand extension]], and global branding.
*Level 1 includes joining with another company to penetrate the market
*Level 2 is working to extend the brand based on the company's current market share
*Level 3 tries to achieve a global strategy by combining the two brands

== Forms of co-branding ==

There are many different sub-sections of co-branding.  Companies can work with other companies to combine resources and leverage individual core competencies, or they can use current resources within one company to promote multiple products at once.  The forms of co-branding include: ingredient co-branding, same-company co-branding, national to local co-branding, joint venture co-branding, and multiple sponsor co-branding.  No matter which form a company chooses to use, the purpose is to respond to the changing marketplace, build one’s own core competencies, and work to increase product revenues.

One form of co-branding is '''ingredient co-branding'''.  This involves creating brand equity for materials, components or parts that are contained within other products.

Examples:
*[[Betty Crocker]]’s brownie mix includes [[The Hershey Company|Hershey’s]] [[Chocolate syrup|Chocolate Syrup]]
*[[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] [[Chocolate brownie|Brownies]] with [[Nestlé]] Chocolate
*[[Dell]] Computers with [[Intel]] Processors 
*[[Kellogg Company|Kellogg]] Pop-tarts with [[The J.M. Smucker Company|Smucker]]’s fruit

Another form of co-branding is '''same-company co-branding'''.  This is when a company with more than one product promotes their own brands together simultaneously.

Examples
*[[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] [[Lunchables]] and [[Oscar Mayer]] meats
*[[Courtyard by Marriott]], a hotel brand (Courtyard) operating under [[Marriott International]]'s signature brand (Marriott)

'''National to local co-branding''' occurs when a local small business teams up with a national brand or network to target local audiences and interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sproutloud.com/resources/newsletter/national-local-new-co-branding-paradigm|title=From National to Local – The New Co-Branding Paradigm|access-date=31 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906101452/http://www.sproutloud.com/resources/newsletter/national-local-new-co-branding-paradigm|archive-date=6 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jul2009/sb20090710_255169.htm|title=The Pros and Cons of Co-Branding|author=Steve McKee|work=Businessweek.com}}</ref>

Examples: 
*Visa co-branding credit cards with local retailers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.visa.com/merchants/grow-your-business/marketing-solutions/co-branded-cards/index.jsp|title=Visa USA – Merchant Marketing}}</ref>
*Auto manufacturers with local dealerships

'''Joint venture co-branding''' is another form of co-branding defined as two or more companies going for a strategic alliance to present a product to the target audience.

Example:

*[[British Airways]] and [[Citibank]] formed a partnership offering a credit card where the card owner will automatically become a member of the British Airways Executive club.

Finally, there is '''multiple sponsor co-branding'''.  This form of co-branding involves two or more companies '''working together''' to form a strategic alliance in technology, promotions, sales, etc.

Example:

*[[Citibank]]/[[American Airlines]]/[[Visa credit card]] partnership<ref>Wei-Lun Chang, “Roadmap of Co-branding Positions and Strategies”, ''Journal of American Academy of Business'', Cambridge (JAABC), Vol. 15, September, pp. 77–84, 2009.</ref>

==Relationship between brand equity, brand association, and co-branding==
Brand name indicates the customer about their connection with the brand based on information or experience. [[Brand equity]] defines the association of consumer towards a brand name. The original brand name is familiar among the customers whereas the co-branded brand is still new. There are plenty of associations of consumers towards co-branded products. Therefore, the customer’s use constituent brand information when there is absence of new brand formed by co-branding. When there is a negative image caused by one of the constituent brand, it also affects the other constituent brand. Brand equity can be damaged by pairing up with a brand which may have negative image in future. [[Brand association]] is developed over the years by repeated experiences and exposures. It helps customers gather information, differentiate it and come to a buying decision. Co-branding can either improve or destroy customer’s perception of each constituent brands and create a new perception for the co-branded product.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Relationship between co-branding, brand equity and associative learning|journal=Co-branding: Brand Equity and Trial Effects|doi=10.1108/07363760010357796}}</ref> Research suggests that the dissimilarity between co-branding organizations (company size, company origin country, industry scale) negatively affect the performance of co-branding organizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Decker|first=Carolin|last2=Baade|first2=Annika|date=November 2016|title=Consumer perceptions of co-branding alliances: Organizational dissimilarity signals and brand fit|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41262-016-0013-5|journal=Journal of Brand Management|language=en|volume=23|issue=6|pages=648–665|doi=10.1057/s41262-016-0013-5|issn=1350-231X|via=}}</ref>
