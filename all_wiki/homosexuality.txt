'''Homosexuality''' is [[Romance (love)|romantic]] attraction, [[sexual attraction]], or [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] between members of the same [[sex]] or [[gender]].<!-- NOTE: This is sourced. Further, "sex" and "gender" are not always the same thing; for example, "sex" may refer to "biological sex" (being male or female), while "gender" may refer to a person's gender identity of being a man or a woman; therefore, like the Sexual orientation, Heterosexuality and Bisexuality articles, we have included both in the lead. --><ref name="AmPsycholAssn-definitions">{{cite web|title=Definitions Related to Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity in APA Documents|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|date=2015|access-date=February 6, 2020|page=6 |url=https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf|quote=Sexual orientation refers to the sex of those to whom one is sexually and romantically attracted.

Individuals may identify as lesbian, gay, heterosexual, bisexual, queer, pansexual, or asexual, among others. [...] Categories of sexual orientation typically have included attraction to members of one's own sex (gay men or lesbians), attraction to members of the other sex (heterosexuals), and attraction to members of both sexes (bisexuals). While these categories continue to be widely used, research has suggested that sexual orientation does not always appear in such definable categories and instead occurs on a continuum [...].

The most common terms for homosexual people are ''[[lesbian]]'' for females and ''[[gay]]'' for males, but ''gay'' also commonly refers to both homosexual females and males. The percentage of people who are gay or lesbian and the proportion of people who are in same-sex romantic relationships or have had same-sex sexual experiences are difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons, including many gay and lesbian people not openly identifying as such due to [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] such as [[homophobia]] and [[heterosexism]].<ref name="levay">[[Simon LeVay|LeVay, Simon]] (1996).

The word ''homosexual'' is a Greek and Latin [[Hybrid word|hybrid]], with the first element derived from Greek ὁμός ''homos'', "same" (not related to the Latin ''homo'', "man", as in ''Homo sapiens''), thus connoting sexual acts and affections between members of the same sex, including lesbianism.<ref>{{cite book |title= A Dictionary of True Etymologies|last=Room |first=Adrian |year=1986 |isbn=978-0710203403 |page=84 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A Student's Dictionary of Psychology |last=Statt |first=David A. |year=2004 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1841693422 |page=[https://archive.org/details/studentsdictiona0000stat/page/93 93] |url=https://archive.org/details/studentsdictiona0000stat/page/93 }}</ref> The first known appearance of ''homosexual'' in print is found in an 1869 German pamphlet by the Austrian-born novelist [[Karl-Maria Kertbeny]], published anonymously,<ref name=glbtq>{{citation|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/kertbeny_km.html |title=Karl-Maria Kertbeny: The Coinage and Dissemination of the Term |access-date=12 June 2012 |periodical=[[glbtq.com]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927020758/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/kertbeny_km.html |archive-date=27 September 2012 }}</ref> arguing against a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] anti-[[sodomy law]].<ref name=glbtq /><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Feray Jean-Claude |author2=Herzer Manfred | year = 1990 | title = Homosexual Studies and Politics in the 19th Century: Karl Maria Kertbeny | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 19 | page = 1 | doi=10.1300/j082v19n01_02}}</ref> In 1886, the psychiatrist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] used the terms ''homosexual'' and ''heterosexual'' in his book ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (Richard von Krafft-Ebing book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]''.

Many modern [[style guide]]s in the U.S. recommend against using ''homosexual'' as a noun, instead using ''gay man'' or ''lesbian''.<ref name=glaad>[http://www.glaad.org/referenceguide Media Reference Guide] (citing AP, NY Times, [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] style guides), [[GLAAD]]. Retrieved 10 May 2007.</ref> Similarly, some recommend completely avoiding usage of ''homosexual'' as it has a negative, clinical history and because the word only refers to one's sexual behavior (as opposed to romantic feelings) and thus it has a negative [[connotation]].<ref name=glaad/> ''Gay'' and ''lesbian'' are the most common alternatives. The first letters are frequently combined to create the [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] LGBT (sometimes written as GLBT), in which ''B'' and ''T'' refer to [[bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people.

''Gay'' especially refers to male homosexuality,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gay|title=gay|website=Oxford Dictionaries|access-date=7 August 2015|quote=(Of a person, especially a man) homosexual.}}</ref> but may be used in a broader sense to refer to all [[LGBT]] people. In the context of sexuality, ''lesbian'' refers only to female homosexuality. The word ''lesbian'' is derived from the name of the Greek island [[Lesbos]], where the poet [[Sappho]] wrote largely about her emotional relationships with young women.<ref>Marguerite Johnson, Terry Ryan: ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman society and literature: a sourcebook'' p.4</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lesbian |title=Lesbian &#124; Define Lesbian at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=24 August 2010}}</ref>

Although early writers also used the adjective ''homosexual'' to refer to any single-sex context (such as an all-girls school), today the term is used exclusively in reference to sexual attraction, activity, and orientation. The term ''[[homosociality|homosocial]]'' is now used to describe single-sex contexts that are not specifically sexual. There is also a word referring to same-sex love, ''[[homophilia]]''.

Some synonyms for same-sex attraction or sexual activity include ''[[men who have sex with men]]'' or ''MSM'' (used in the medical community when specifically discussing sexual activity) and ''[[homoeroticism|homoerotic]]'' (referring to works of art).<ref name=UNAIDS>{{cite web|title=UNAIDS: Men who have sex with men |publisher=UNAIDS |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf |access-date=4 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320001221/http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf |archive-date=20 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Younger|first=John G.|title=Sex in the ancient world from A to Z|url=https://archive.org/details/sexancientworldf00youn|url-access=limited|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0-415-24252-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/sexancientworldf00youn/page/n58 38]|edition=1st published.}}</ref> [[Pejorative]] terms in English include ''[[queer]]'', ''[[faggot (slang)|faggot]]'', ''[[fairy]]'', ''poof'', and ''homo''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2000|isbn=0-618-70172-9|url=https://archive.org/details/americanheritage00edit_9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Spears | first = Richard A. | title = Fag | work = Dictionary of American Slang and Colloquial Expressions | year=2007 | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faggot | access-date = 4 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Dalzell|2008|p=1104}}</ref><ref name=terms>{{cite web |url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041015054212/http://www.sex-lexis.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 October 2004 |title=Dictionary of Sexual Terms |publisher=Sex-lexis.com |access-date=4 October 2012 }}</ref> Beginning in the 1990s, some of these have been [[reclaimed word|reclaimed]] as positive words by gay men and lesbians, as in the usage of [[queer studies]], [[queer theory]], and even the popular American television program ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Marvin J.|title=Queer Things from Old Closets: Libraries Gay and Lesbian Studies – Queer Theory|url=http://rbm.acrl.org/content/rbml/8/1/19.full.pdf|publisher=[[Association of College and Research Libraries]]|access-date=4 October 2012}}</ref> The word ''{{linktext|homo}}'' occurs in many other languages without the pejorative connotations it has in English.<ref>{{cite book|last=eds|first=Marc Wolinsky|title=Gays and the military : Joseph Steffan versus the United States|year=1993|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691033072|pages=49–55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kM8WgQQghwIC&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49#v=onepage&q=Gays%20military%20homo%20derogatory%20epithet|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref> As with [[ethnic slur]]s and [[racial slur]]s, the use of these terms can still be highly offensive.

==History==
{{Main|LGBT history|Timeline of LGBT history|History of homosexuality}}

In cultures influenced by [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Sodomy law#History|law]] and the [[Christianity and homosexuality|church]] established [[sodomy]] as a transgression against divine law or a [[crime against nature]]. The condemnation of [[anal sex]] between males, however, predates Christian belief.

In social science, there has been a dispute between "essentialist" and "constructionist" views of homosexuality. The debate divides those who believe that terms such as "gay" and "straight" refer to objective, culturally invariant properties of persons from those who believe that the experiences they name are artifacts of unique cultural and social processes. "Essentialists" typically believe that sexual preferences are determined by biological forces, while "constructionists" assume that sexual desires are learned.<ref>{{cite book |author=Halperin, David M. |title=One Hundred Years of Homosexuality: And Other Essays on Greek Love |url=https://archive.org/details/onehundredyearso0000halp |url-access=registration |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1990 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/onehundredyearso0000halp/page/41 41–42] |isbn=0-415-90097-2 }}</ref> The philosopher of science [[Michael Ruse]] has stated that the social constructionist approach, which is influenced by Foucault, is based on a selective reading of the historical record that confuses the existence of homosexual people with the way in which they are labelled or treated.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ruse, Michael |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |page=399 |isbn=0-19-926479-1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bJFCAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PT971}}</ref>

As is true of many other non-Western cultures, it is difficult to determine the extent to which Western notions of sexual orientation and gender identity apply to Pre-Columbian cultures.

The Spanish conquerors were horrified to discover sodomy openly practiced among native peoples, and attempted to crush it out by subjecting the ''berdaches'' (as the Spanish called them) under their rule to severe penalties, including public [[Capital punishment|execution]], burning and being torn to pieces by dogs.<ref name="coello">Mártir de Anglería, Pedro.

As a result of the growing influence and power of the conquerors, many native cultures started condemning homosexual acts themselves.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Among some of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in North America prior to European colonization, a relatively common form of same-sex sexuality centered around the figure of the [[Two-Spirit]] individual (the term itself was coined only in 1990). Typically, this individual was recognized early in life, given a choice by the parents to follow the path and, if the child accepted the role, raised in the appropriate manner, learning the customs of the gender it had chosen. Two-Spirit individuals were commonly [[shamanism|shamans]] and were revered as having powers beyond those of ordinary shamans. Their sexual life was with the ordinary tribe members of the same sex.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

During the colonial times following the European invasion, homosexuality was prosecuted by the Inquisition, some times leading to death sentences on the charges of sodomy, and the practices became clandestine. Many homosexual individuals went into heterosexual marriages to keep appearances, and many turned to the clergy to escape public scrutiny of their lack of interest in the opposite sex.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

====United States====
{{See also|LGBT history in the United States|LGBT historic places in the United States}}
In 1986, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' that a state could criminalize [[sodomy]], but, in 2003, overturned itself in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' and thereby legalized homosexual activity throughout the [[United States of America]].

[[Same-sex marriage in the United States]] expanded from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015, through various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes ([[referendums]] and [[initiative]]s), and federal court rulings.

===East Asia===
[[File:Woman spying on male lovers.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A woman spying on a pair of male lovers. China, [[Qing Dynasty]].]]
In [[East Asia]], same-sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history.

[[Homosexuality in China]], known as the ''passions of the cut peach'' and various other euphemisms, has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. Homosexuality was mentioned in many famous works of Chinese literature. The instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions described in the classical novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' seem as familiar to observers in the present as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period.  [[Confucianism]], being primarily a social and political philosophy, focused little on sexuality, whether homosexual or heterosexual. Ming Dynasty literature, such as ''Bian Er Chai'' (弁而釵/弁而钗), portray homosexual relationships between men as more enjoyable and more "harmonious" than heterosexual relationships.<ref>Kang, Wenqing. ''Obsession: male same-sex relations in China, 1900–1950'', Hong Kong University Press. Page 2</ref> Writings from the [[Liu Song Dynasty]] by Wang Shunu claimed that homosexuality was as common as heterosexuality in the late 3rd century.<ref name="Geng">{{cite book|author=Song Geng|title=The fragile scholar: power and masculinity in Chinese culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ei4PJ92qy6IC&pg=PA1443|year=2004|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-620-2|page=144}}</ref>

Opposition to homosexuality in China originates in the medieval [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907), attributed to the rising influence of Christian and Islamic values,<ref name="Hinsch, Bret 1990 p. 77-78">Hinsch, Bret.  (1990).  ''Passions of the Cut Sleeve''.

{{further|Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Timeline of LGBT history in the United Kingdom|Homosexuality in medieval Europe}}
The earliest Western documents (in the form of literary works, art objects, and [[Greek mythology|mythographic materials]]) concerning same-sex relationships are derived from [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]].

In regard to male homosexuality, such documents depict an at times complex understanding in which relationships with women and relationships with adolescent boys could be a part of a normal man's love life. [[Same-sex relationship]]s were a social institution variously constructed over time and from one city to another. The formal practice, an erotic yet often restrained relationship between a free adult male and a free adolescent, was valued for its [[pedagogy|pedagogic]] benefits and as a means of population control, though occasionally blamed for causing disorder. [[Plato]] praised its benefits in his early writings<ref name=plato1>[[Plato]], Phaedrus in the ''[[Symposium]]''</ref> but in his late works proposed its prohibition.<ref name=plato2>Plato, Laws, 636D & 835E</ref> [[Aristotle]], in the ''Politics'', dismissed Plato's ideas about abolishing homosexuality (2.4); he explains that barbarians like the [[Celts]] accorded it a special honor (2.6.6), while the [[Cretans]] used it to regulate the population (2.7.5).<ref name=boswell1>{{harv|Boswell|1980}}</ref>

Some scholars argue that there are examples of homosexual love in ancient literature, such as [[Achilles and Patroclus]] in the ''[[Iliad]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morales |first1=Manuel Sanz |last2=Mariscal |first2=Gabriel Laguna |title=The Relationship between Achilles and Patroclus according to Chariton of Aphrodisias |journal=The Classical Quarterly |date=2003 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=292–295 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3556498?seq=1 |issn=0009-8388}}</ref>

[[File:Lafond Sappho and Homer.jpg|left|thumb|Female youths are depicted surrounding Sappho in this painting of [[Lafond]] "Sappho sings for Homer", 1824.]]

Little is known of female homosexuality in antiquity. [[Sappho]], born on the island of [[Lesbos]], was included by later Greeks in the canonical list of [[nine lyric poets]]. The adjectives deriving from her name and place of birth ([[Sapphic love|Sapphic]] and Lesbian) came to be applied to female homosexuality beginning in the 19th century.<ref name=lesbian>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lesbian|title=Lesbian|access-date=7 February 2009|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|year=2001|author=Douglas Harper}}</ref><ref name=sapphic>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Sapphic|title=Sapphic|access-date=7 February 2009|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|year=2001|author=Douglas Harper}}</ref> Sappho's poetry centers on passion and love for various personages and both genders. The narrators of many of her poems speak of [[infatuation]]s and [[love]] (sometimes requited, sometimes not) for various females, but descriptions of physical acts [[Lesbian|between women]] are few and subject to debate.<ref>Denys Page, ''Sappho and Alcaeus'', Oxford UP, 1959, pp. 142–146.</ref><ref>{{harv|Campbell|1982|p=xi–xii}}</ref>

[[File:NAMA Sappho lisant.jpg|thumb|Sappho reading to her companions on an Attic vase of c. 435 BC.]]

In [[Ancient Rome]], the young male body remained a focus of male sexual attention, but relationships were between older free men and slaves or freed youths who took the receptive role in sex. The [[Hellenophile]] emperor [[Hadrian]] is renowned for his relationship with [[Antinous]], but the Christian emperor [[Theodosius I]] decreed a law on 6 August 390, condemning passive males to be burned at the stake. Notwithstanding these regulations taxes on [[brothel]]s with boys available for homosexual sex continued to be collected until the end of the reign of [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] in 518. [[Justinian I|Justinian]], towards the end of his reign, expanded the proscription to the active partner as well (in 558), warning that such conduct can lead to the destruction of cities through the "wrath of God".

====Renaissance====
During the [[Renaissance]], wealthy cities in northern [[Italy]]—[[Florence]] and [[Venice]] in particular—were renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable part of the male population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome.<ref>Rocke, Michael, (1996), ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', {{ISBN|0-19-512292-5}}</ref><ref>Ruggiero, Guido, (1985), ''The Boundaries of Eros'', {{ISBN|0-19-503465-1}}</ref> But even as many of the male population were engaging in same-sex relationships, the authorities, under the [[aegis]] of the [[Officers of the Night]] court, were prosecuting, fining, and imprisoning a good portion of that population.

From the second half of the 13th century, death was the punishment for male homosexuality in most of Europe.<ref>{{Cite book

The relationships of socially prominent figures, such as [[Personal relationships of James VI and I|King James I]] and the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], served to highlight the issue, including in anonymously authored street pamphlets: "The world is chang'd I know not how, For men Kiss Men, not Women now;...Of J. the First and Buckingham: He, true it is, his Wives Embraces fled, To slabber his lov'd Ganimede" (''Mundus Foppensis, or The Fop Display'd'', 1691).

''Love Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the Famous Mr. Wilson'' was published in 1723 in England, and is presumed by some modern scholars to be a novel. The 1749 edition of [[John Cleland]]'s popular novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' includes a homosexual scene, but this was removed in its 1750 edition. Also in 1749, the earliest extended and serious defense of homosexuality in English, ''Ancient and Modern [[Pederasty]] Investigated and Exemplified'', written by [[Thomas Cannon]], was published, but was suppressed almost immediately. It includes the passage, "Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts."<ref>Gladfelder, Hal (May 2006) ''In Search of Lost Texts: Thomas Cannon's 'Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplified"'', Institute of Historical Research</ref> Around 1785 [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote another defense, but this was not published until 1978.<ref>Journal of Homosexuality ({{ISSN|0091-8369}}) Volume: 3 Issue: 4, Volume: 4 Issue: 1</ref> Executions for sodomy continued in the [[Netherlands]] until 1803, and in [[England]] until 1835, [[James Pratt and John Smith]] being the last Englishmen to be so hanged.

Between 1864 and 1880 [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] published a series of twelve tracts, which he collectively titled ''Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love.'' In 1867, he became the first self-proclaimed homosexual person to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the Congress of German Jurists in [[Munich]] for a resolution urging the repeal of anti-homosexual laws.<ref name="levay" /> ''Sexual Inversion'' by [[Havelock Ellis]], published in 1896, challenged theories that homosexuality was abnormal, as well as [[stereotype]]s, and insisted on the ubiquity of homosexuality and its association with intellectual and artistic achievement.<ref name="sexualinversion">{{citation |title=Sexual Inversion |first=Havelock |last=Ellis |first2=John Addington |last2=Symonds |year=1975 |publisher=Arno Press |isbn=0-405-07363-1}} (reprint)</ref>

Although medical texts like these (written partly in Latin to obscure the sexual details) were not widely read by the general public, they did lead to the rise of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]], which campaigned from 1897 to 1933 against [[Paragraph 175|anti-sodomy laws in Germany]], as well as a much more informal, unpublicized movement among British intellectuals and writers, led by such figures as [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[John Addington Symonds]]. Beginning in 1894 with ''Homogenic Love'', Socialist activist and poet Edward Carpenter wrote a string of pro-homosexual articles and pamphlets, and "came out" in 1916 in his book ''My Days and Dreams''. In 1900, [[Elisar von Kupffer]] published an anthology of homosexual literature from antiquity to his own time, ''[[Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur]]''.

In ancient [[Assyria]], homosexuality was present and common; it was also not prohibited, condemned, nor looked upon as immoral or disordered. Some religious texts contain prayers for divine blessings on homosexual relationships.<ref>Gay Rights Or Wrongs: A Christian's Guide to Homosexual Issues and Ministry, by Mike Mazzalonga, 1996, p.11</ref><ref>The Nature Of Homosexuality, Erik Holland, page 334, 2004</ref> The ''Almanac of Incantations'' contained prayers favoring on an [[equality before the law|equal basis]] the love of a man for a woman, of a woman for a man, and of a man for man.<ref>Pritchard, p. 181.</ref>

===South Pacific===
In some societies of [[Melanesia]], especially in [[Papua New Guinea]], same-sex relationships were an integral part of the culture until the middle of the 1900s. The [[Etoro people|Etoro]] and [[Marind-anim]] for example, viewed heterosexuality as unclean and celebrated homosexuality instead. In some traditional Melanesian cultures a prepubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would "inseminate" him (orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty. Many Melanesian societies, however, have become hostile towards same-sex relationships since the introduction of [[Christianity]] by [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] [[missionaries]].<ref name=melanesia>{{citation |title=Ritualized Homosexuality in Melanesia |first=Gilbert H. |last=Herdt |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-08096-3 |pages=128–136}}</ref>

==Sexuality and identity==

===Behavior and desire===

The [[American Psychological Association]], the [[American Psychiatric Association]], and the [[National Association of Social Workers]] identify sexual orientation as "not merely a personal characteristic that can be defined in isolation. Rather, one's sexual orientation defines the universe of persons with whom one is likely to find the satisfying and fulfilling relationships":<ref name=amici />
{{quote|Sexual orientation is commonly discussed as a characteristic of the individual, like biological sex, gender identity, or age. This perspective is incomplete because sexual orientation is always defined in relational terms and necessarily involves relationships with other individuals. Sexual acts and romantic attractions are categorized as homosexual or heterosexual according to the biological sex of the individuals involved in them, relative to each other. Indeed, it is by acting—or desiring to act—with another person that individuals express their heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality. This includes actions as simple as holding hands with or kissing another person. Thus, sexual orientation is integrally linked to the intimate personal relationships that human beings form with others to meet their deeply felt needs for love, attachment, and intimacy. In addition to sexual behavior, these bonds encompass nonsexual physical affection between partners, shared goals and values, mutual support, and ongoing commitment.<ref name=amici />}}

The [[Kinsey scale]], also called the Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale,<ref name="kinsey">{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-hhscale.html|title=Kinsey's Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale|publisher=The [[Kinsey Institute]]|access-date=8 September 2011}}</ref> attempts to describe a person's sexual history or episodes of his or her sexual activity at a given time. It uses a scale from 0, meaning exclusively [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]], to 6, meaning exclusively homosexual. In both the Male and Female volumes of the [[Kinsey Reports]], an additional grade, listed as "X", has been interpreted by scholars to indicate [[asexuality]].<ref name="Stange">{{cite book|author1=Mary Zeiss Stange|author2= Carol K.

''Coming out'' (''of the closet'') is a phrase referring to one's disclosure of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and is described and experienced variously as a psychological process or journey.<ref name="Coming Out: A Journey">{{cite web|url=http://utahpridecenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=44 |title=Coming Out: A Journey |publisher=Utahpridecenter.org |access-date=22 July 2012}}</ref> Generally, coming out is described in three phases. The first phase is that of "knowing oneself", and the realization emerges that one is open to same-sex relations.<ref>In a joint statement with other major American medical organizations, the APA says that "different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual".

According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006), "the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity.

One widely reported early estimate was 10% (e.g., Marmor, 1980; Voeller, 1990). Some recent data provided support for this estimate (Bagley and Tremblay, 1998), but most recent large national samples suggest that the prevalence of male homosexuality in modern western societies, including the United States, is lower than this early estimate (e.g., 1–2% in Billy et al., 1993; 2–3% in Laumann et al., 1994; 6% in Sell et al., 1995; 1–3% in Wellings et al., 1994). It is of note, however, that homosexuality is defined in different ways in these studies. For example, some use same-sex behavior and not same-sex attraction as the operational definition of homosexuality (e.g., Billy et al., 1993); many sex researchers (e.g., Bailey et al., 2000; Bogaert, 2003; Money, 1988; Zucker and Bradley, 1995) now emphasize attraction over overt behavior in conceptualizing sexual orientation." (p. 33) Also: "...the prevalence of male homosexuality (in particular, same-sex attraction) varies over time and across societies (and hence is a "moving target") in part because of two effects: (1) variations in fertility rate or family size; and (2) the fraternal birth order effect. Thus, even if accurately measured in one country at one time, the rate of male homosexuality is subject to change and is not generalizable over time or across societies."

A survey by the UK [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) in 2010 found that 95% of Britons identified as heterosexual, 1.5% of Britons identified themselves as homosexual or bisexual, and the last 3.5% gave more vague answers such as "don't know", "other", or did not respond to the question.<ref>{{cite web|title=Measuring Sexual Identity : Evaluation Report, 2010|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ethnicity/measuring-sexual-identity---evaluation-report/2010/index.html|publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]|date=23 September 2010}}</ref>

Measuring the prevalence of homosexuality presents difficulties. It is necessary to consider the measuring criteria that are used, the cutoff point and the time span taken to define a sexual orientation.<ref name="levay"/> Many people, despite having same-sex attractions, may be reluctant to identify themselves as gay or bisexual. The research must measure some characteristic that may or may not be defining of sexual orientation. The number of people with same-sex desires may be larger than the number of people who act on those desires, which in turn may be larger than the number of people who self-identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.<ref name=black/>

==Psychology==
{{Main|Homosexuality and psychology}}
The [[American Psychological Association]], the [[American Psychiatric Association]], and the [[National Association of Social Workers]] state:
{{cquote|In 1952, when the American Psychiatric Association published its first [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], homosexuality was included as a disorder. Almost immediately, however, that classification began to be subjected to critical scrutiny in research funded by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]]. That study and subsequent research consistently failed to produce any empirical or scientific basis for regarding homosexuality as a disorder or abnormality, rather than a normal and healthy sexual orientation. As results from such research accumulated, professionals in medicine, mental health, and the behavioral and social sciences reached the conclusion that it was inaccurate to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder and that the DSM classification reflected untested assumptions based on once-prevalent social norms and clinical impressions from unrepresentative samples comprising patients seeking therapy and individuals whose conduct brought them into the criminal justice system.

In recognition of the scientific evidence,<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1998 | title = Gay Is Okay With APA—Forum Honors Landmark 1973 Events | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=187846 | journal = [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | volume = 280 | issue = 6| pages = 497–499 | doi = 10.1001/jama.280.6.497 }}</ref> the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the DSM in 1973, stating that "homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities." After thoroughly reviewing the scientific data, the American Psychological Association adopted the same position in 1975, and urged all mental health professionals "to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated with homosexual orientations." The National Association of Social Workers has adopted a similar policy.

Thus, mental health professionals and researchers have long recognized that being homosexual poses no inherent obstacle to leading a happy, healthy, and productive life, and that the vast majority of gay and lesbian people function well in the full array of social institutions and interpersonal relationships.<ref name=amici />}}

Most lesbian, gay, and bisexual people who seek psychotherapy do so for the same reasons as heterosexual people (stress, relationship difficulties, difficulty adjusting to social or work situations, etc.); their sexual orientation may be of primary, incidental, or no importance to their issues and treatment. Whatever the issue, there is a high risk for anti-gay bias in psychotherapy with lesbian, gay, and bisexual clients.<ref name=textbook>Cabaj, R; Stein, T. eds. ''Textbook of Homosexuality and Mental Health'', p. 421</ref> Psychological research in this area has been relevant to counteracting prejudicial ("[[homophobia|homophobic]]") attitudes and actions, and to the [[LGBT rights]] movement generally.<ref name=intro>ed. Sandfort, T; et al. Lesbian and Gay Studies: An Introductory, Interdisciplinary Approach. Chapter 2.</ref>

The appropriate application of affirmative psychotherapy is based on the following scientific facts:<ref name="response"/>
* Same-sex sexual attractions, behavior, and orientations per se are normal and positive variants of human sexuality; in other words, they are not indicators of mental or developmental disorders.
* Homosexuality and bisexuality are stigmatized, and this stigma can have a variety of negative consequences (e.g., [[minority stress]]) throughout the life span (D'Augelli & Patterson, 1995; DiPlacido, 1998; Herek & Garnets, 2007; Meyer, 1995, 2003).
* Same-sex sexual attractions and behavior can occur in the context of a variety of sexual orientations and sexual orientation identities (Diamond, 2006; Hoburg et al., 2004; Rust, 1996; Savin-Williams, 2005).
* Gay men, lesbians, and bisexual individuals can live satisfying lives as well as form stable, committed relationships and families that are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential respects (APA, 2005c; Kurdek, 2001, 2003, 2004; Peplau & Fingerhut, 2007).
* There are no empirical studies or peer-reviewed research that support theories attributing same-sex sexual orientation to family dysfunction or trauma (Bell et al., 1981; Bene, 1965; Freund & Blanchard, 1983; Freund & Pinkava, 1961; Hooker, 1969; McCord et al., 1962; D. K. Peters & Cantrell, 1991; Siegelman, 1974, 1981; Townes et al., 1976).

==Causes==

===Biological vs environmental determinants===
{{Main|Biology and sexual orientation|Environment and sexual orientation}}
Although scientists favor biological models for the cause of sexual orientation,<ref name="Frankowski"/> they do not believe that the development of sexual orientation is the result of any one factor. They generally believe that it is determined by a complex interplay of [[Biology and sexual orientation|biological]] and [[environment and sexual orientation|environmental factors]], and is shaped at an early age.<ref name="apahelp"/><ref name="Lamanna"/><ref name="Stuart"/> There is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation than social ones, especially for males.<ref name="Bailey"/> There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role with regard to sexual orientation.<ref name="rcp2007"/> Scientists do not believe that sexual orientation is a choice.<ref name="Frankowski"/><ref name="Lamanna"/><ref name="Kersey-Matusiak"/>

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] stated in ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' in 2004:
{{cquote|There is no scientific evidence that abnormal parenting, sexual abuse, or other adverse life events influence sexual orientation. Current knowledge suggests that sexual orientation is usually established during early childhood.<ref name="Frankowski"/><ref name="perrin2002">{{Cite book

The [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Psychiatric Association]], and [[National Association of Social Workers]] stated in 2006:
{{cquote|Currently, there is no scientific consensus about the specific factors that cause an individual to become heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual—including possible biological, psychological, or social effects of the parents' sexual orientation. However, the available evidence indicates that the vast majority of lesbian and gay adults were raised by heterosexual parents and the vast majority of children raised by lesbian and gay parents eventually grow up to be heterosexual.<ref name="apahelp"/>}}

==== "Gay genes" ====
{{main|Gay gene}}
Despite numerous attempts, no "gay gene" has been identified. However, there is substantial evidence for a genetic basis of homosexuality, especially in males, based on [[twin studies]]; some association with regions of [[Chromosome 8]], the [[Xq28]] locus on the [[X chromosome]], and other sites across many chromosomes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ngun | first1 = TC | last2 = Vilain | first2 = E | year = 2014 | title = The biological basis of human sexual orientation: is there a role for epigenetics? | journal = Adv Genet | volume = 86 | pages = 167–84 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-800222-3.00008-5 | pmid = 25172350 }}</ref>

{{Gay gene}}

Starting in the 2010s, potential [[epigenetic]] factors have become a topic of increased attention in genetic research on sexual orientation. A study presented at the [[American Society of Human Genetics|ASHG]] 2015 Annual Meeting found that the methylation pattern in nine regions of the genome appeared very closely linked to sexual orientation, with a resulting algorithm using the [[methylation]] pattern to predict the sexual orientation of a control group with almost 70% accuracy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Balter|first=Michael|date=2015-10-09|title=BEHAVIORAL GENETICS.

===Evolutionary perspectives===
Since homosexuality tends to lower reproductive success, and since there is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, it is unclear how it is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency.<ref>Zietsch et al. (2008)</ref> There are many possible explanations, such as genes predisposing to homosexuality also conferring advantage in heterosexuals, a [[kin selection]] effect, social prestige, and more.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Evolutionary-Mystery-of/135762/|title=The Evolutionary Mystery of Homosexuality|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|author=David P.

===Sexual orientation change efforts===
{{Main|Sexual orientation change efforts}}
There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor that conclude that sexual orientation change efforts work to change a person's sexual orientation. Those efforts have been controversial due to tensions between the values held by some faith-based organizations, on the one hand, and those held by LGBT rights organizations and professional and scientific organizations and other faith-based organizations, on the other.<ref name="apa2009"/> The longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the health and mental health professions is that homosexuality ''per se'' is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation, and therefore not a mental disorder.<ref name="apa2009"/> The American Psychological Association says that "most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation".<ref name="answers">{{cite web

Some individuals and groups have promoted the idea of homosexuality as symptomatic of developmental defects or spiritual and moral failings and have argued that sexual orientation change efforts, including psychotherapy and religious efforts, could alter homosexual feelings and behaviors. Many of these individuals and groups appeared to be embedded within the larger context of conservative religious political movements that have supported the stigmatization of homosexuality on political or religious grounds.<ref name="apa2009" />

No major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation.

The American Psychological Association states that "sexual orientation is not a choice that can be changed at will, and that sexual orientation is most likely the result of a complex interaction of environmental, cognitive and biological factors...is shaped at an early age...[and evidence suggests] biological, including genetic or inborn hormonal factors, play a significant role in a person's sexuality."<ref name="Lamanna"/> They say that "sexual orientation identity—not sexual orientation—appears to change via psychotherapy, support groups, and life events."<ref name=apa2009/> The American Psychiatric Association says "individuals maybe become aware at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual" and "opposes any psychiatric treatment, such as 'reparative' or [[Conversion therapy|'conversion' therapy]], which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality ''[[Per se (terminology)|per se]]'' is a mental disorder, or based upon a prior assumption that the patient should change his/her homosexual orientation". They do, however, encourage [[gay affirmative psychotherapy]].<ref name="What is">[http://www.psychiatry.org/lgbt-sexual-orientation "LGBT-Sexual Orientation: What is Sexual Orientation?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628094701/http://www.psychiatry.org/lgbt-sexual-orientation |date=28 June 2014 }}, the official web pages of APA.

The American Psychological Association "encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others' sexual orientation and concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation".<ref name="apa2009"/>

===Mental===
When it was first described in medical literature, homosexuality was often approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as its root cause. Much literature on mental health and homosexual patients centered on their [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[substance abuse]], and suicide. Although these issues exist among people who are [[non-heterosexual]], discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] (DSM) in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexual people face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.<ref>

Suggested reasons for this disparity are that (1) LGBT youths may be specifically targeted on the basis of their [[sexual orientation profiling|perceived sexual orientation]] or gender non-conforming appearance, and (2) that "risk factors associated with sexual minority status, including discrimination, invisibility, and rejection by family members...may lead to an increase in behaviors that are associated with risk for victimization, such as substance abuse, sex with multiple partners, or running away from home as a teenager."<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/journals/features/ccp733477.pdf |title=Victimization Over the Life Span: A Comparison of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Heterosexual Siblings |first=Kimberly F. |last=Balsam |author2=Esther D.

1: During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] annexed territory or established {{lang|de|[[reichskommissariat]]}}s which extended [[Paragraph 175|Germany's laws against same-sex sexual activity]] to those territories and {{lang|de|reichskommissariat}}s. Same-sex sexual activity was previously legalized in the following countries or territories before German annexation or establishment of {{lang|de|reichskommissariat}}s: {{lang|fr|[[Bas-Rhin]]}} ([[LGBT rights in France|legal in 1791]]), [[Belgium]] ([[LGBT rights in Belgium|legal in 1795]]), {{lang|it|[[Province of Belluno|Belluno]]}} ([[LGBT rights in Italy|legal in 1890]]), {{lang|it|[[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]]}} ([[LGBT rights in Italy|legal in 1890]]), {{lang|fr|[[Haut-Rhin]]}} ([[LGBT rights in France|legal in 1791]]), [[Luxembourg]] ([[LGBT rights in Luxembourg|legal in 1795]]), {{lang|fr|[[Moselle]]}} ([[LGBT rights in France|legal in 1791]]), [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] ([[LGBT rights in the Netherlands|legal in 1811]]), {{lang|fr|[[Nord (French department)|Nord]]}} ([[LGBT rights in France|legal in 1791]]), {{lang|fr|[[Pas-de-Calais]]}} ([[LGBT rights in France|legal in 1791]]), [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] ([[LGBT rights in Poland|legal in 1932]]), and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|{{lang|it|Trentino-Alto Adige|nocat=y}} / {{lang|de|Südtirol|nocat=y}}]] ([[LGBT rights in Italy|legal in 1890]]). All countries and territories listed that where annexed or established into {{lang|de|reichskommissariat}}s by Nazi Germany during World War II where restored as independent countries or reincorporated into their previous countries during or after the war and thus re-legalized same-sex sexual activity in those areas.<br />
2: In May 1973, the [[Libyan Arab Republic]] annexed the [[Aouzou Strip]] from [[Chad]]. Libya's laws against same-sex sexual activity where thus extended to the annexed Aouzou Strip. In August 1987, during the [[Toyota War]] between the [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] and Chad, Aouzou fell to the Chadian forces, only to be repelled by an overwhelming Libyan counter-offensive. The Aouzou dispute was concluded on 3 February 1994, when the judges of the [[International Court of Justice]] by a majority of 16 to 1 decided that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on 15 April 1994, and was completed by 10 May 1994. The formal and final transfer of the Aouzou Strip from Libya to Chad took place on 30 May 1994, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.<br />

Same-sex sexual activity had also never been criminalized in continent of [[Antarctica]].}}]]
{{LGBT rights}}
Most nations do not prohibit consensual sex between unrelated persons above the local [[age of consent]]. Some jurisdictions further recognize identical rights, protections, and privileges for the family structures of same-sex couples, including [[same-sex marriage|marriage]]. Some countries and jurisdictions mandate that all individuals restrict themselves to heterosexual activity and disallow homosexual activity via [[sodomy law]]s. Offenders can face the death penalty in Islamic countries and jurisdictions ruled by [[sharia]]. There are, however, often significant differences between official policy and real-world enforcement.

Although homosexual acts were decriminalized in some parts of the [[Western world]], such as [[LGBT rights in Poland|Poland]] in 1932, [[LGBT rights in Denmark|Denmark]] in 1933, [[LGBT rights in Sweden|Sweden]] in 1944, and the [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|England and Wales]] in 1967, it was not until the mid-1970s that the [[LGBT community|gay community]] first began to achieve limited [[civil rights]] in some [[developed country|developed countries]]. A turning point was reached in 1973 when the [[American Psychiatric Association]], which previously listed homosexuality in the [[DSM-I]] in 1952, removed homosexuality in the [[DSM-II]], in recognition of scientific evidence.<ref name=amici/> In 1977, [[Quebec]] became the first state-level jurisdiction in the world to prohibit [[discrimination]] on the grounds of sexual orientation. During the 1980s and 1990s, most [[developed country|developed countries]] enacted laws decriminalizing homosexual behavior and prohibiting discrimination against lesbian and gay people in employment, housing, and services. On the other hand, many countries today in the Middle East and Africa, as well as several countries in Asia, the Caribbean and the South Pacific, outlaw homosexuality. In 2013, the [[Supreme Court of India]] upheld Section 377 of the [[Indian Penal Code]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Shyamantha |first=Asokan |title=India's Supreme Court turns the clock back with gay sex ban |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/11/us-india-rights-gay-idUSBRE9BA05620131211 |access-date=23 December 2013 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=11 December 2013 }}</ref> but in 2018 overturned itself and legalized homosexual activity throughout India.<ref>{{cite news |title=Supreme Court of India scraps ban on homosexuality with its judgment on Section 377. |date=9 September 2018 |work=[[NDTV]] |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/supreme-court-verdict-of-section-377-full-text-1912373 }}</ref> The [[Section 377]], a [[British Empire|British colonial-era]] law which criminalizes homosexual activity, remains in effect in more than 40 former British colonies.<ref>{{cite news |title=The homophobic legacy of the British Empire |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/11/asia/british-empire-lgbt-rights-section-377-intl/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=12 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=In over 40 countries, laws against homosexuality are a lasting legacy of British rule |url=https://qz.com/india/1380947/section-377-the-former-british-colonies-with-laws-against-gay-people/ |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |date=6 September 2018}}</ref>

{{Further|LGBT social movements}}
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2018}}

Since the 1960s, many LGBT people in the West, particularly those in major metropolitan areas, have developed a so-called [[Queer culture|gay culture]]. To many,{{Who|date=January 2012}} gay culture is exemplified by the [[gay pride]] movement, with annual parades and displays of rainbow flags. Yet not all LGBT people choose to participate in "queer culture", and many gay men and women specifically decline to do so. To some{{Who|date=January 2012}} it seems to be a frivolous display, perpetuating gay stereotypes.

With the outbreak of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] in the early 1980s, many LGBT groups and individuals organized campaigns to promote efforts in AIDS education, prevention, research, patient support, and community outreach, as well as to demand government support for these programs.

The death toll wrought by the AIDS epidemic at first seemed to slow the progress of the gay rights movement, but in time it galvanized some parts of the LGBT community into community service and political action, and challenged the heterosexual community to respond compassionately. Major American motion pictures from this period that dramatized the response of individuals and communities to the AIDS crisis include ''[[An Early Frost]]'' (1985), ''[[Longtime Companion]]'' (1990), ''[[And the Band Played On]]'' (1993), ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' (1993), and ''[[Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt]]'' (1989).

[[Coming out|Publicly gay politicians]] have attained numerous government posts, even in countries that had [[sodomy law]]s in their recent past. Examples include [[Guido Westerwelle]], Germany's [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]]; [[Peter Mandelson]], a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] cabinet minister and [[Per-Kristian Foss]], formerly [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Minister of Finance]].

LGBT movements are opposed by a variety of individuals and organizations.

===Military service===
[[File:Obama signs DADT repeal.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] signs into law the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]]]]
{{Main|Sexual orientation and military service}}
Policies and attitudes toward gay and lesbian [[military]] personnel vary widely around the world. Some countries allow gay men, lesbians, and bisexual people to serve openly and have granted them the same rights and privileges as their heterosexual counterparts. Many countries neither ban nor support LGB service members. A few countries continue to ban homosexual personnel outright.

Most Western military forces have removed policies excluding sexual minority members. Of the 26 countries that participate militarily in [[NATO]], more than 20 permit openly gay, lesbian and bisexual people to serve. Of the permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], three ([[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[United States]]) do so. The other two generally do not: [[China]] bans gay and lesbian people outright, [[Russia]] excludes all gay and lesbian people during peacetime but allows some gay men to serve in wartime (see below). [[Israel]] is the only country in the Middle East region that allows openly LGB people to serve in the military.

While the question of homosexuality in the military has been highly politicized in the United States, it is not necessarily so in many countries. Generally speaking, sexuality in these cultures is considered a more personal aspect of one's identity than it is in the United States.

According to the [[American Psychological Association]], [[empirical evidence]] fails to show that sexual orientation is germane to any aspect of military effectiveness including [[unit cohesion]], morale, recruitment and retention.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=American Psychological Association | url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/military.aspx | title=Proceedings of the American Psychological Association, Incorporated, for the legislative year 2004.

Western society has become increasingly accepting of homosexuality since the 1990s. In 2017, Professor Amy Adamczyk contended that these cross-national differences in acceptance can be largely explained by three factors: the relative strength of democratic institutions, the level of economic development, and the religious context of the places where people live.<ref name="Adamczyk">{{cite book | last=Adamczyk|first=Amy |title=Cross-National Public Opinion about Homosexuality: Examining Attitudes across the Globe| year=2017|publisher=University of California Press|pages=3–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wly8DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}</ref>

===Relationships===
In 2006, the [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Psychiatric Association]] and [[National Association of Social Workers]] stated in an [[Amicus curiae|amicus brief]] presented to the [[Supreme Court of California]]: "Gay men and lesbians form stable, committed relationships that are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential respects. The institution of marriage offers social, psychological, and health benefits that are denied to same-sex couples. By denying same-sex couples the right to marry, the state reinforces and perpetuates the stigma historically associated with homosexuality. Homosexuality remains stigmatized, and this stigma has negative consequences. California's prohibition on marriage for same-sex couples reflects and reinforces this stigma". They concluded: "There is no scientific basis for distinguishing between same-sex couples and heterosexual couples with respect to the legal rights, obligations, benefits, and burdens conferred by civil marriage."<ref name=amici />

===Religion===

Though the relationship between [[religion and homosexuality|homosexuality and religion]] is complex, current authoritative bodies and doctrines of the world's largest religions view homosexual behaviour negatively.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} This can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, to explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality.

In the US, teenage students heard anti-gay slurs such as "homo", "faggot" and "sissy" about 26 times a day on average, or once every 14 minutes, according to a 1998 study by Mental Health America (formerly National Mental Health Association).<ref>{{cite web|title=Mental Health American, Bullying and Gay Youth |url=http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth |publisher="Mental Health America" formerly National Mental Health Association |access-date=27 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414144851/http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth |archive-date=14 April 2012 }}</ref>

In many cultures, homosexual people are frequently subject to prejudice and discrimination. A 2011 Dutch study concluded that 49% of Holland's youth and 58% of youth foreign to the country reject homosexuality.<ref>{{cite web|title=Half of young Dutch people reject homosexuality|url=http://community.expatica.com/forums/topic/2993/half-of-young-dutch-people-reject-homosexuality|publisher=Expatica/COC|access-date=9 January 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201212113/http://community.expatica.com/forums/topic/2993/half-of-young-dutch-people-reject-homosexuality|archive-date=1 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Similar to other minority groups they can also be subject to [[LGBT stereotypes|stereotyping]]. These attitudes tend to be due to forms of homophobia and heterosexism (negative [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, bias, and discrimination in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships). Heterosexism can include the presumption that everyone is [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the [[norm (social)|norm]] and therefore superior. {{linktext|Homophobia}} is a fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against homosexual people. It manifests in different forms, and a number of different types have been postulated, among which are internalized homophobia, social homophobia, emotional homophobia, rationalized homophobia, and others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allies.tamu.edu/Did+You+Know/riddle.htm |title=The Riddle Homophobia Scale, from Allies Committee website, Department of Student Life, Texas A&M University |access-date=1 June 2016}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> Similar is [[lesbophobia]] (specifically targeting lesbians) and [[biphobia]] (against bisexual people).

The community in the country is exposed to additional risk of prejudice, social rejection and violence, with a greater impossibility of obtaining protection even from the police.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.dk/samling/20161/almdel/uui/bilag/148/1735024.pdf|title=Morocco Situation of LGBT Persons|access-date=21 March 2019|publisher=Danish Immigration Service}}</ref>

In 2017, Abderrahim El Habachi became one of the many homosexual Moroccans to flee the country for fear, and sought shelter in the [[United Kingdom]]. In August 2019, he accused the [[Home Office|UK Home Office]] of not taking LGBT migrants seriously. He highlighted that they are being put through tough times because the Home Office don't believe their sexual orientation or in the struggles they face in their countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/08/20/gay-asylum-seeker-fled-morocco-home-office-claims-taken-seriously/|title=Gay man who fled Morocco says LGBT asylum seekers’ claims are ‘not being taken seriously’|access-date=20 August 2019|newspaper=Pink News}}</ref>

Homosexual and bisexual behaviors occur in a number of other animal species. Such behaviors include [[Animal sexual behaviour|sexual activity]], [[courtship]], [[affection]], [[pair bond]]ing, and [[parenting]],<ref name=Bagemihl/> and are widespread; a 1999 review by researcher [[Bruce Bagemihl]] shows that homosexual behavior has been documented in about 500 species, ranging from [[primate]]s to [[Acanthocephala|gut worms]].<ref name=Bagemihl/><ref name="Biological Exuberance: Animal">{{cite magazine

A review paper by N. W. Bailey and [[Marlene Zuk]] looking into studies of same-sex sexual behaviour in animals challenges the view that such behaviour lowers reproductive success, citing several hypotheses about how same-sex sexual behavior might be adaptive; these hypotheses vary greatly among different species. Bailey and Zuk also suggest future research needs to look into evolutionary consequences of same-sex sexual behaviour, rather than only looking into origins of such behaviour.<ref name="Bailey et al.">{{cite journal | last1 = Bailey | first1 = N.
