The '''American Broadcasting Company''' ('''ABC'''; stylized in lowercase as '''abc''') is an American multinational [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial broadcast]] [[television network]] that is a flagship property of [[Walt Disney Television]], a division of [[Disney General Entertainment Content]] of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. The network is headquartered in [[Burbank, California]], on Riverside Drive, directly across the street from [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] and adjacent to the Roy E. Disney Animation Building. The network's secondary offices, and headquarters of its news division, is in [[New York City]], at its broadcast center at 77 [[66th Street (Manhattan)|West 66th Street]] on the [[Upper West Side, Manhattan|Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]]. The network is the fifth major broadcast network in the world. 

Since 2007, when [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio]] (also known as Cumulus Media Networks) was sold to [[Citadel Broadcasting]], ABC has reduced its broadcasting operations almost exclusively to television. It is the fifth-oldest major broadcasting network in the world and the youngest of the American [[Big Three television networks]]. ABC is nicknamed "'''The Alphabet Network'''", as its [[initialism]] also represents the first three letters of the [[English alphabet]], in order.

ABC launched as a [[radio network]] in 1943, which served as the successor to the [[Blue Network|NBC Blue Network]], which had been purchased by [[Edward John Noble|Edward J. Noble]]. It extended its operations to television in 1948, following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks [[CBS]] and [[NBC]]. In the mid-1950s, ABC merged with [[American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres|United Paramount Theatres]] (UPT), a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Leonard Goldenson]], who had been the head of UPT, made the new television network profitable by helping develop and [[Green-light|greenlight]] many successful series. In the 1980s, after purchasing an 80 percent interest in cable sports channel [[ESPN]], the network's corporate parent, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., merged with [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.|Capital Cities Communications]], owner of several print publications, and television and radio stations. In 1996, most of Capital Cities/ABC's assets were purchased by Disney.

ABC has eight [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] and over 232 [[network affiliate|affiliated]] television stations throughout the United States and its territories. Some ABC-affiliated stations can also be seen in Canada via pay-television providers, and certain other affiliates can also be received over-the-air in areas near the [[Canada–United States border]]. [[ABC News]] provides news and features content for select radio stations owned by [[Cumulus Media]], as these stations are former ABC Radio properties.

==History==
{{main|History of the American Broadcasting Company}}
The network's history dates back to 1927, when the network was created as an [[NBC]]-operated radio network called the [[Blue Network|NBC Blue Network]]. It would later become an independent television network known as the American Broadcasting Company in 1943, and be purchased by [[The Walt Disney Company]] on February 6, 1996.

==Programming==

{{Cleanup rewrite|it has a tendency toward [[WP:NOTTVGUIDE]] and is largely unsourced, which makes notability questionable.|2=section|date=May 2020}}
The ABC television network provides 89 hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week.{{when|date=May 2020}} The network provides 22&nbsp;hours of prime time programming to affiliated stations from 8:00–11:00&nbsp;p.m. Monday through Saturday (all times Eastern and Pacific Time) and 7:00–11:00&nbsp;p.m. on Sundays.

Daytime programming is also provided from 11:00&nbsp;a.m. to 3:00&nbsp;p.m. weekdays (with a one-hour break at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern/Pacific for stations to air newscasts, locally produced programming or syndicated programs) featuring the talk-lifestyle shows ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]]'' and ''[[Strahan, Sara and Keke]]'', and the soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]''. [[ABC News]] programming includes ''Good Morning America'' from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. weekdays (along with one-hour weekend editions); nightly editions of ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'' (whose weekend editions are occasionally subject to abbreviation or preemption due to sports telecasts overrunning into the program's timeslot), the [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday political talk show]] ''[[This Week (American TV program)|This Week]]'', early morning news programs ''[[World News Now]]'' and ''[[America This Morning]]'' and the late night newsmagazine ''[[Nightline]]''. Late nights feature the weeknight talk show ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.

The network's three-hour Saturday morning children's programming timeslot is programmed by syndication distributor [[Litton Entertainment]], which produces ''[[Litton's Weekend Adventure]]'' under an arrangement in which the [[block programming|programming block]] is syndicated exclusively to ABC owned-and-operated and affiliated stations, rather than being leased out directly by the network to Litton.

===Daytime===
{{Main|ABC Daytime}}
ABC's daytime schedule currently features the talk shows ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]]'' and ''[[Strahan, Sara and Keke]]'' (the latter an offshoot of ''Good Morning America''), and the soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]''. Originally premiering in 1963, ''General Hospital'' is ABC's longest-running entertainment program.

In addition to the long-running ''[[All My Children]]'' (1970–2011) and ''[[One Life to Live]]'' (1968–2012), notable past soap operas seen on the daytime lineup include ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'', ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'', ''[[The City (1995 TV series)|The City]]'' and ''[[Port Charles]]''. ABC also aired the last nine years of the [[Procter & Gamble]]-produced soap ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', following its cancellation by CBS in 1975. ABC Daytime has also aired a number of game shows, including ''[[The Dating Game]]'', ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'', ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', ''[[Password (American game show)|Password]]'', ''[[Split Second (game show)|Split Second]]'', ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10,000/$20,000 Pyramid]]'', ''[[Family Feud]]'', ''[[The Better Sex]]'', ''[[Trivia Trap]]'', ''[[All-Star Blitz]]'' and ''[[Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak|Hot Streak]]''.

=== Sports ===
{{main|ESPN on ABC|History of ABC Sports}}

Sports programming is provided on occasion, primarily on weekend afternoons. Since 2006, the ABC Sports division has been defunct, with all sports telecasts on ABC being produced in association with sister cable network [[ESPN]] under the branding [[ESPN on ABC]]. While ABC has, in the past, aired notable sporting events such as the NFL's ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', and various [[college football]] [[bowl game]]s, general industry trends and changes in rights have prompted reductions in sports on broadcast television, with Disney preferring to schedule the majority of its sports rights on the networks of ESPN.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/major-sporting-events-becoming-even-dispersed-across-television.html|title=Major sporting events are becoming even more dispersed across television|date=March 29, 2017|website=Awful Announcing|language=en-US|access-date=December 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/sports/ncaafootball/06sandomir.html|title=As Bowls Migrate to Cable, Viewership Is Just a Number|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=January 4, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 29, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

ABC is the broadcast television rightsholder of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), with its package (under the ''[[NBA on ESPN]]'' branding) traditionally beginning with its [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|Christmas Day games]], followed by a series of [[NBA Saturday Primetime|Saturday night]] and Sunday afternoon games through the remainder of the season, weekend [[NBA Playoffs|playoff]] games, and all games of the [[NBA Finals]]. During [[ESPN College Football on ABC|college football]] season, ABC typically carries an afternoon doubleheader on Saturdays, along with the primetime ''[[Saturday Night Football]]''. ABC also airs coverage of selected bowl games. Beginning in the [[2015 NFL season]], ESPN agreed to begin simulcasting a [[NFL playoffs|wild card playoff game]] on ABC.<ref name=":0" />

The Saturday afternoon lineup outside of football season typically features airings of [[ESPN Films]] documentaries and other studio programs under the banner ''[[ESPN Sports Saturday]]'', while Sunday afternoons usually feature either [[brokered programming]], or encore and [[Burning off|burn-off]] airings of ABC programs.

In 2015, ESPN's annual [[ESPY Awards]] presentation moved to ABC from ESPN. Bolstered by [[Caitlyn Jenner]] accepting the inaugural [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]] during the ceremony, the [[2015 ESPY Awards]]' viewership were roughly tripled over the 2014 ceremony on ESPN.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/espn-upfront-share-nfl-football-wild-card-espys-abc-1201493164/|title=ESPN To Share Football, ESPYs With ABC|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=2015-05-12|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/ratings-espy-awards-soar-on-abc-cbs-big-brother-steady-1201541579/|title=Ratings: ESPY Awards Soar on ABC; CBS' 'Big Brother' Steady|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=2015-07-16|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>

===Specials===
ABC currently holds the broadcast rights to the [[Academy Award]]s, [[Emmy Award]]s,{{efn|Broadcast rights to the Emmy Awards are rotated across all four major networks on a year-to-year basis}} [[American Music Award]]s, and the [[Country Music Association Awards]].{{efn|Along with two associated specials, the ''[[CMA Music Festival]]'' and ''CMA Country Christmas''.}}{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} ABC has also aired the [[Miss America]] competition from 1954 to 1956, 1997 to 2005, and 2011 to 2018.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC TO BROADCAST MISS AMERICA IN ATLANTIC CITY, NJ |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/miss-america-heads-back-atlantic-city-nj-0 |agency=Associated Press |access-date=February 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007161608/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/miss-america-heads-back-atlantic-city-nj-0 |archive-date=October 7, 2013}}</ref>

Since 2000, ABC has also owned the television rights to most of the ''[[Peanuts]]'' television specials, having acquired the broadcast rights from CBS, which originated the specials in 1965 with the debut of ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' (other ''Peanuts'' specials broadcast annually by ABC, including ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'', include ''[[It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown]]'' and ''[[A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving]]''). ABC also broadcasts the annual ''[[Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade]]'' special on Christmas morning.{{relevance inline|date=May 2020}}

Since 1974, ABC has generally aired ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'' – a New Year's Eve special featuring music performances and coverage of festivities in New York's [[Times Square Ball|Times Square]].{{efn|The only exception was in 1999, when ABC instead broadcast ''[[ABC 2000 Today]]'', a day-long telecast produced by ABC News as part of the ''[[2000 Today]]'' consortium, which was hosted by [[Peter Jennings]] and covered festivities from around the world (Dick Clark co-hosted coverage from Times Square).}} ABC is also among the broadcasters of the [[Rose Parade|Tournament of Roses Parade]] (although as mentioned, the [[Rose Bowl Game]] now airs exclusively on ESPN as a College Football Playoff "[[New Year's Six]]" bowl).{{relevance inline|date=May 2020}}

===Programming library===
ABC owns nearly all of its in-house television and theatrical productions made from the 1970s onward, with the exception of certain co-productions (for example, ''[[The Commish]]'' is now owned by the estate of its producer, [[Stephen J. Cannell|Stephen Cannell]]). Worldwide video rights are currently owned by various companies; for example, [[Kino Lorber]] owns the North American home video rights to the ABC feature film library (along with some lesser known live action films from Disney's library, mostly from [[Touchstone Pictures]], [[Hollywood Pictures]] and [[20th Century Studios]]).

When the FCC imposed its [[Financial Interest and Syndication Rules]] rules in 1970, ABC proactively created two companies: Worldvision Enterprises as a syndication distributor, and ABC Circle Films as a production company. However, between the publication and implementation of these regulations, the separation of the network's catalog was made in 1973. The broadcast rights to pre-1973 productions were transferred to Worldvision, which became independent in the same year. The company has been sold several times since [[Paramount Television]] acquired it in 1999, and has most recently been absorbed into [[CBS Television Distribution]], a unit of [[ViacomCBS]]. Nonetheless, Worldvision sold portions of its catalog, including the [[Ruby-Spears]] and Hanna-Barbera libraries, to [[Turner Broadcasting System]] in 1991. With Disney's 1996 purchase of ABC, ABC Circle Films was absorbed into Touchstone Television, a Disney subsidiary which in turn was renamed ABC Studios in 2007.<ref name="WDC-ABC">{{cite news|title=Disney to Drop Buena Vista Brand Name, People Say (Update1)|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a0MG17nO.PG8|first=Andy|last=Fixmer|work=Bloomberg, L.P.|date=April 25, 2007|access-date=November 28, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019154748/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a0MG17nO.PG8|archive-date=October 19, 2012}}</ref>

Also part of the library are most films in the [[David O. Selznick]] library, the [[Cinerama Productions]]/Palomar theatrical library (with the exception of those films produced in Cinerama which are now under the control of [[Pacific Theatres]] and Flicker Alley), the Selmur Productions catalog that the network acquired some years back, and the in-house productions it continues to produce (such as ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', ''General Hospital'', ABC News productions, and series from [[Walt Disney Television|Disney Television Studios]] ([[ABC Signature]] and [[20th Television]])). [[Disney–ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly known as Buena Vista Television and 20th Television) handles domestic television distribution, while [[Disney Media Distribution|Disney–ABC International Television]] (formerly known as Buena Vista International Television) handles international television distribution.

==Stations==

<!--- Please update station count in the below paragraph whenever the accompanying list referenced is updated. ---><!--Only do so with reliable sources and when important to the overall subject, given that there are over 200 stations. -->
Since its inception, ABC has had over 300 television stations that have carried programming from the network at various times throughout its history, including its first two owned-and-operated and affiliated stations, founding O&O WABC-TV and inaugural affiliate WPVI-TV. {{As of|2020}}, ABC has eight owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 236 additional television stations encompassing 49 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. possessions, Bermuda and [[Saba]].<ref name=re>{{cite web|title=Stations for Network – ABC|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&network=ABC|work=RabbitEars.info|access-date=October 30, 2019}}</ref><ref name="StationIndex">{{cite web|title=Network Profile: ABC|url=http://www.stationindex.com/tv/by-net/abc|publisher=Station Index}}</ref> This makes ABC the largest U.S. broadcast television network by total number of affiliates. The network has an estimated national reach of 97.72% of all households in the United States (or 305,347,338 Americans with at least one television set).

Currently, [[New Jersey]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Delaware]] are the only U.S. states where ABC does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Jersey is served by New York City O&O WABC-TV in the north half of the state and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV in the south; Rhode Island is served by [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]-licensed [[WLNE-TV|WLNE]], though outside of the transmitter, all other operations for the station are based in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]; and Delaware is served by WPVI in the northern third and [[Salisbury, Maryland]], affiliate [[WMDT]] in the southern two-thirds of the state). ABC maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as [[Birmingham, Alabama]] ([[WBMA-LD]]), [[Lima, Ohio]] ([[WPNM-LD]]) and [[South Bend, Indiana]] ([[WBND-LD]]). In some markets, including the former two mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station.

The network has the unusual distinction of having separately owned-and-operated affiliates which serve the same market in [[Tampa, Florida]] (WFTS-TV and [[WWSB]]), [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] ([[KLKN-TV]] and [[KHGI-TV]]), and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] ([[WZZM]] and [[WOTV]]), with an analogous situation arising in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] ([[KMBC-TV]] and [[KQTV]]). KQTV is licensed to [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]], which [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] designates as a separate market from Kansas City, despite a mere {{convert|55|mi|km|adj=on}} distance between the two cities and the Kansas City-based stations (including KMBC) providing better [[broadcast range|city-grade to Grade B]] coverage to the area compared to the signals of the primary ABC affiliates in the other aforementioned dual-affiliate markets. (KQTV was St. Joseph's lone major network affiliate until 2011, when locally based [[News-Press & Gazette Company]] began establishing low-power affiliates of ABC's four English-language competitors and [[Telemundo]] on three low-power stations to end St. Joseph's dependence on Kansas City.) WWSB, KHGI and WOTV, meanwhile, serve areas that do not receive an adequate signal from their market's primary ABC affiliate. (Of note, ABC initially affiliated with WWSB to cover southern portions of the Tampa–St. Petersburg market—including WWSB's [[city of license]], [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]]—as the transmitters of [[WTSP]], the market's former primary ABC affiliate from 1965 to 1994, and [[Miami]] affiliate [[WPLG]] had been short-spaced to avoid interference between their respective analog-VHF channel 10 signals; WWSB remained an ABC affiliate after its Tampa affiliation moved from WTSP to WFTS in December 1994, even though WFTS's signal reaches Sarasota and some surrounding areas.){{relevance inline|date=May 2020}}{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] is the largest operator of ABC stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to 28 full, primary ABC affiliates and two subchannel-only affiliates. Sinclair owns the largest ABC subchannel affiliate by market size, [[WABM|WABM-DT2]]/[[WTTO|WDBB-DT2]] in the Birmingham market, which serve as repeaters of WBMA-LD (which itself is also simulcast on a subchannel of former WBMA satellite [[WGWW]], owned by Sinclair partner company [[Howard Stirk Holdings]]). The E.&nbsp;W. Scripps Company is the largest operator of ABC stations in terms of overall market reach, owning 15 ABC-affiliated stations (including affiliates in larger markets such as [[WEWS|Cleveland]], [[KNXV-TV|Phoenix]], [[WXYZ-TV|Detroit]] and [[KMGH-TV|Denver]]), and through its ownership of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] affiliate KNXV, [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] affiliate [[KTNV-TV]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] affiliate [[KGUN-TV]], it is the only provider of ABC programming for the majority of [[Arizona]] (outside the [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]]-[[El Centro, California|El Centro]] market) and [[Southern Nevada]]. Scripps also owns and operates several ABC stations in the Mountain and Pacific time zones, including in Denver, [[KGTV|San Diego]], [[KERO-TV|Bakersfield, California]], and [[KIVI-TV|Boise, Idaho]], and when combined with [[ABC Owned Television Stations|the ABC-owned stations]] in [[KABC-TV|Los Angeles]], [[KFSN-TV|Fresno]], and [[KGO-TV|San Francisco]], the affiliations from the News-Press & Gazette Company in [[KEYT-TV|Santa Barbara]], [[KESQ-TV|Palm Springs]], [[KECY-TV|Yuma-El Centro]], and [[KRDO-TV|Colorado Springs-Pueblo]], and Sinclair's affiliations in [[KOMO-TV|Seattle]] and [[KATU|Portland, Oregon]], these four entities control the access of ABC network programming in most of the Western United States, particularly in terms of audience reach.

==Facilities and studios==
All of ABC's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates have had their own facilities and studios,{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} but transverse entities have been created to produce national programming. As a result, television series were produced by ABC Circle Films beginning in 1962 and by Touchstone Television beginning in 1985, before Touchstone was reorganized as [[ABC Studios]] in February&nbsp;2007. Since the 1950s, ABC has had two main production facilities: the [[ABC Television Center]] (now The Prospect Studios) on [[Hollywood Boulevard|Prospect Avenue]] in [[Hollywood, California]], shared with the operations of KABC-TV until 1999; and the ABC Television Center, East, a set of studios located throughout New York City.

In addition to the headquarters building on Riverside Drive, other ABC facilities in Burbank include a building at 3800 West Alameda, known as 'Burbank Center', which is primarily associated with [[Disney–ABC Television Group]] and functions as the headquarters and broadcast center for [[Disney Junior]], [[Disney Channel]], [[Disney XD]], [[Freeform (TV channel)|FreeForm]], and [[Radio Disney]]. Additionally, [[Disney Television Animation]] has a facility on Empire Avenue near the [[Hollywood Burbank Airport]]. In nearby [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], Disney/ABC also maintains the [[Grand Central Airport (California)#Grand Central Creative Campus|Grand Central Creative Campus]], which houses other company subsidiaries, including the studios of KABC-TV and the Los Angeles bureau of ABC News.

ABC owns several facilities in New York grouped mainly on West 66th Street, with the main set of facilities on the corner of Columbus Avenue. In total, ABC's facilities occupy a combined {{convert|9755|m²|sqft|sp=us}} of the {{convert|14864|m²|sqft|sp=us}} of the blocks they encompass.{{relevance inline|date=May 2020|Is this a useful statistic?

ABC also owns the [[Times Square Studios]] at 1500 Broadway, on land owned by a development fund for the [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] Project. Opened in 1999, ''Good Morning America'' is broadcast from this facility. ABC News has premises on West 66th Street, in a six-story building occupying a {{convert|196|x|379|ft|m|adj=on}} plot at 121–135 [[West End Avenue]]. The block of West 66th street between Central Park West and Columbus Ave which houses the ABC News building was renamed Peter Jennings Way in 2006 in honor of the then-recently deceased news anchor.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC Block Re-Named "Peter Jennings Way"|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/abc-block-re-named-peter-jennings-way/78926|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|date=February 21, 2006|access-date=March 12, 2015}}</ref>{{relevance inline|date=May 2020}}

On July 9, 2018, the Walt Disney Company announced that it was selling its two West 66th Street campuses (except for the National Guard Amory) to [[Silverstein Properties]] and purchasing one square block of property in lower Manhattan to build a new New York-based broadcast center.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/nyregion/disney-move-upper-west-side-hudson-square.html|title=Disney Will Move New York Operations to Lower Manhattan|last=Bagli|first=Charles V.|date=July 9, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 31, 2018}}</ref>

===Video-on-demand services===
ABC maintains several [[video-on-demand]] (VOD) services for delayed viewing of the network's programming, including a traditional VOD service called ABC on Demand, which is carried on most traditional cable and [[IPTV]] providers. The Walt Disney Company is also a part-owner of [[Hulu]], and has offered full-length episodes of most of ABC's programming through this [[streaming media|streaming]] service since July&nbsp;6, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABC Arrives on Hulu (Finally!)|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/167904/abc_arrives_on_hulu_finally.html|work=[[PC World]]}}</ref>

In May 2013, ABC launched "WatchABC", a revamp of its traditional multi-platform streaming services encompassing the network's existing streaming portal at ABC.com and a [[mobile app]] for smartphones and tablet computers. This service provides full-length episodes of ABC programs and live streams of local affiliates in select markets (this was the first such offering by a U.S. broadcast network). However, live streams are only available to [[TV Everywhere|authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers]]. WABC-TV New York and WPVI-TV Philadelphia were the first stations to offer streams of their programming on the service, with the six remaining ABC O&Os offering streams by the start of the 2013–14 season. [[Hearst Television]] also reached a deal to offer streams of its ABC affiliates on the service, though {{as of|2016|lc=y}} these stations are only available for live-streaming for [[DirecTV]] subscribers.<ref name=variety-watchabc>{{cite news|title=ABC to Stream Live Via App|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/abc-to-stream-live-via-app-1200479778/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=June 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name=engadget-watchabc>{{cite web|title=Watch ABC app with live TV streaming comes to Kindle Fire, but not Google Play|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/31/watch-abc-app-kindle-fire/|work=[[Engadget]]|date=May 31, 2013|access-date=June 1, 2013}}</ref>

The most recent episodes of the network's shows are usually made available on the ABC app, Hulu and ABC on Demand the day after their original broadcast. In addition, ABC on Demand disallows [[fast forward]]ing of accessed content. Restrictions implemented on January&nbsp;7, 2014, restrict streaming of the most recent episode of any ABC program on Hulu and the ABC app until eight days after their initial broadcast, in order to encourage live or same-week viewing (via [[digital video recorder|DVR]] and cable on demand), with day-after-air streaming on either service limited to subscribers of participating pay television providers using an authenticated internet account.

===ABC HD===
[[File:ABC HD logo.svg|upright=|thumb|left|Logo for ABC HD]]
ABC's network feeds are transmitted in [[720p]] [[high-definition television|high definition]] (HD), the native resolution format for The Walt Disney Company's U.S. television properties. However, most of Hearst Television's 16 ABC-affiliated stations transmit the network's programming in [[1080i]] HD, while 11 other affiliates owned by various companies carry the network feed in [[480i]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]]<ref name=re/> either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry ABC programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed ABC affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD.

ABC began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed, ABC HD, on September&nbsp;16, 2001, at the start of the [[2001–02 United States network television schedule|2001–02 season]], with its scripted prime time series becoming the first shows to upgrade to the format. Both new and returning scripted series were broadcast in high definition. In 2011, ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' was the last program on the network's schedule that was broadcast in [[4:3]] standard definition. All of the network's new programming has been presented in HD since January&nbsp;2012. The affiliate-syndicated Saturday morning educational and informative ([[E/I]]) block ''Litton's Weekend Adventure'' was the first children's program block on U.S. network television to feature programs available in HD upon its September&nbsp;2011 debut.

On September 1, 2016, ABC began to use [[16:9 aspect ratio|16:9]] framing for all of most graphical imaging{{clarify|date=May 2020|problem=What does "all of most" mean? Why not just "most"?}} (primarily the network's logo bug, in-program promotions and generic closing credit sequences as well as sports telecasts, where the BottomLine and scoreboard elements now extend outside the 4:3 frame), requiring its stations and pay television providers to display its programming in a compulsory [[widescreen]] format, either in high definition or standard definition. With this change, some programs also began positioning their main on-screen credits outside the 4:3 aspect ratio.

[[File:ABC (2013) Gold.svg|thumb|right|upright=.682|A gold-colored version of the ABC circle, used during primetime.]]
The ABC logo has evolved many times since the network's creation in 1943. The network's first logo, introduced in 1946, consisted of a television screen containing the letters "T" and "V", with a vertical ''ABC'' microphone in the center,<ref name="logo evolution">{{cite web|title=The Evolution of ABC |url=http://members.fortunecity.com/tvnetworks/abc/ |publisher=TV Network Extravaganza |access-date=November 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331214424/http://members.fortunecity.com/tvnetworks/abc/ |archive-date=March 31, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> referencing the network's roots in radio. When the ABC-UPT merger was finalized in 1953, the network introduced a new logo based on the FCC seal, with the letters "ABC" enclosed in a circular [[Heraldry|shield]] surmounted by a bald eagle.<ref name="logo evolution"/> In 1957, just before the television network began its first color broadcasts, the ABC logo consisted of a tiny lowercase "abc" in the center of a large lowercase letter ''a'', a design known as the ABC Circle A.<ref name="logo evolution"/>

In 1962, graphic designer Paul Rand redesigned the ABC logo into its current and best-known form, with the lowercase letters "abc" enclosed in a single black circle. The new logo debuted on-air for ABC's promos at the start of the 1963–64 season. The letters are strongly reminiscent of the [[Bauhaus (typeface)|Bauhaus]] typeface designed by [[Herbert Bayer]] in the 1920s,{{Sfn|Gernsheimer|2010|p=43}} but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as [[ITC Avant Garde]] and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet. The logo's simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate, which was beneficial before the advent of computer graphics. A color version of the logo was also developed around 1963, and animated as a brief 10-second intro to be shown before the then-small handful of network programs broadcast in color (similar to the NBC "Laramie" peacock intro used during that era). The "a" was rendered in red, the "b" in blue, and the "c" in green, against the same single black circle. A variant of this color logo, with the colored letters against a white circle, was also commonly used throughout the 1960s.

The 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of many graphical imaging packages for the network which based the logo's setting mainly on special lighting effects then under development including white, blue, pink, rainbow neon, and glittering dotted lines. Among the ABC Circle logo's many variants was a 1977 ID sequence that featured a bubble on a black background representing the circle with glossy gold letters, and was the first ABC identification card to simulate a three-dimensional appearance.<ref name="logo evolution"/>

In 1983, for the 40th anniversary of the network's founding, ID sequences had the logo appear in a gold [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] design on a blue background, accompanied by the slogan "That Special Feeling" in a script font.<ref name="logo evolution"/> Ten years later, in 1993, the "ABC Circle" logo reverted to its classic white-on-black color scheme, but with gloss effects on both the circle and the letters, and a bronze border surrounding the circle.<ref name="logo evolution"/> The ABC logo first appeared as an [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen bug]] in the [[1993–94 United States network television schedule|1993–94 season]], appearing initially only for 60 seconds at the beginning of an act or segment, then appearing throughout programs beginning in the [[1995–96 United States network television schedule|1995–96 season]]; the respective iterations of the translucent logo bug were also incorporated within program promotions until the 2011–12 season.

During the 1998–99 season, the network began using a minimalist graphical identity with a yellow and black motif, designed by Pittard Sullivan, featuring a small black-and-white "ABC Circle" logo on a yellow background (promotions during this time also featured a sequence of still photos of the stars of its programs during the timeslot card as well as the schedule sequence that began each night's prime time lineup).<ref name="logo evolution"/> A new four-note theme tune was introduced alongside the package, based around the network's then-new "We Love TV" image campaign from the 1998–99 season, creating an [[Sound trademark#Sound logos|audio signature]] in comparative parlance to the [[NBC chimes]], CBS's various three-note soundmarks (including the current version introduced in 1992) and the [[20th Century Fox#Logo and fanfare|Fox Fanfare]]. The four-note signature has been updated with every television season thereafter.

In 2000, ABC launched a web-based promotional campaign focused around its circle logo, also called 'the dot', in which comic book character [[Little Dot]] prompted visitors to "download the dot", a program which would cause the ABC logo to fly around the screen and settle in the bottom-right corner.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news|title=ABC tries to bring its longtime 'dot' logo into prominence with a new campaign|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/02/business/media-business-advertising-abc-tries-bring-its-longtime-dot-logo-into-prominence.html|first=Stuart|last=Elliott|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 2, 2000}}</ref> The network hired the Troika Design Group to design and produce its 2001–02 identity, which continued using the black-and-yellow coloring of the logo and featured dots and stripes in various promotional and identification spots.<ref name="InsideDesign">{{cite book|title=Inside design now: National Design Triennial|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qg4RSmCw4UQC&q=abc%20circle%20logo%20%22paul%20rand%22&pg=PA180|first=Ellen|last=Lupton|page=180|isbn=9781568983950|date=March 1, 2003|author-link = Ellen Lupton}}</ref>

On June 16, 2007, ABC began to phase-in a new imaging campaign for the upcoming 2007–08 season, Start Here. Also developed by Troika, the on-air design was intended to emphasize the availability of ABC content across multiple platforms (in particular, using a system of icons representing different devices, such as television, computers and mobile devices). It also sought to "simplify and bring a lot more consistency and continuity to the visual representation of ABC". The ABC logo was given a glossy "ball" effect that was specifically designed for HD. On-air, the logo was accompanied by animated water and ribbon effects. Red ribbons were used to represent the entertainment division, while blue ribbons were used for ABC News.<ref name="abcnews-starthere">{{cite web|title=ABC News: TV Online: A Glimpse of the Future|url=https://www.abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3184117&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|access-date=November 9, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016022057/http://www.abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3184117&page=1|archive-date=October 16, 2008}}</ref><ref name=tvw-starthere>{{cite web|title=ABC's New Graphic Cue Promotes Brand Across Platforms|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/09/abcs_new_graphic_cue_promotes.php/|work=TV Week|access-date=March 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324231418/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/09/abcs_new_graphic_cue_promotes.php/|archive-date=March 24, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A revised version of the ABC logo was introduced for promotions for the 2013–14 season during the network's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation on May 14, 2013, and officially introduced on-air on May 30 (although some affiliates implemented the new design prior to then), as part of an overhaul of ABC's identity by design agency LoyalKaspar. The updated logo carries a simpler gloss design than the previous version, and contains lettering more closely resembling Paul Rand's original version of the circle logo. A new custom [[typeface]] inspired by the ABC logotype, ABC Modern (which closely resembles the Lucas Sharp-designed Sharp Sans font family), was also created for use in advertising and other promotional materials. The logo was used in various color schemes, with a gold version used primarily for ABC's entertainment divisions, a red version used primarily for ESPN on ABC, steel blue and dark grey versions used primarily by ABC News, and all four colors used interchangeably in promotions.<ref name=lk-abc>{{cite web|title=ABC Rebrand |url=http://www.loyalkaspar.com/application/project/abcrebrand/ |publisher=loyalkaspar |access-date=August 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819224905/http://www.loyalkaspar.com/application/project/abcrebrand/ |archive-date=August 19, 2013}}</ref> As part of a reimaging for the 2018–19 season, the color variants were dropped in favor of the dark grey version.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thenewblank.com/project/abc-2018-network-rebrand/|title=ABC 2018 Network Rebrand|work=The New Blank|access-date=September 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

The [[Circle 7 logo]], designed in 1962, is also commonly associated with ABC affiliates who broadcast on channel&nbsp;7, including its flagship local stations WABC-TV (New York City), KABC-TV (Los Angeles), KGO-TV (San Francisco) and WLS-TV (Chicago). This logo was intended to be used somewhat interchangeably by these stations with the main circular network logo and has itself also become an iconic symbol of the ABC network. KGO was the first of the ABC-owned stations to use the Circle 7 logo, starting on August&nbsp;27, 1962; by the end of the year, the other ABC-owned stations began using the logo, and have continued to do so since.

==International development==
The first attempts to internationalize the ABC television network dates to the 1950s, when Goldenson tried to use the same strategies he had in expanding UPT's theater operation to the international market.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991–1993|p=214}} Goldenson said that ABC's first international activity was broadcasting the coronation of [[Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II]] in June&nbsp;1953; CBS and NBC were delayed in covering the coronation due to flight delays.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991–1993|pp=215–216}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/53-OCR/BC-1953-06-08-OCR-Page-0056.pdf|title=Networks Vie for "First" Honors As Radio-TV Cover the Coronation|date=June 8, 1953|work=Broadcasting/Telecasting|access-date=October 6, 2017}}</ref> Goldenson tried international investing, having ABC invest in stations in the Latin American market, acquiring a 51% interest in a network covering Central America and in 1959 established program distributor [[Worldvision Enterprises]].{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991–1993|p=217}} Goldenson also cited interest in Japan in the early 1950s,{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991–1993|p=221}} acquiring a 5% stake in two new domestic networks, the [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]] in 1951 and [[Nihon Educational Television]] in 1957.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991–1993|p=221}} Goldenson also invested in broadcasting properties in [[Beirut]] in the mid-1960s.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991–1993|p=223}}

The goal was to create a network of wholly and partially owned channels and affiliates to rebroadcast the network's programs. In 1959, this rerun activity was completed with program syndication, with ABC Films selling programs to networks not owned by ABC.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991–1993|p=227}} The arrival of satellite television ended the need for ABC to hold interests in other countries;{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991–1993|p=231}} many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties. As a result, ABC was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks, mainly in Japan and Latin America, in the 1970s.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991–1993|p=232}}

The second period of international expansion is linked to that of the ESPN network in the 1990s, and policies enacted in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks. These policies included the expansion of several of the company's U.S.-based cable networks including Disney Channel and its spinoffs Toon Disney, [[Playhouse Disney]] and [[Jetix]]; although Disney also sold its 33% stake in European sports channel [[Eurosport]] for $155&nbsp;million in June&nbsp;2000.<ref name="Annual 2000 p65">{{cite web|title=Disney Annual Report 2000|url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/investors/annual_reports/2000/pdfs/financial.pdf|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|page=65}}</ref> In contrast to Disney's other channels, ABC broadcasts in the United States with programming syndicated in other countries. The policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived and on September&nbsp;27, 2004, ABC announced the launch of [[ABC1 (UK)|ABC1]], a [[free-to-air]] channel in the United Kingdom owned by the ABC Group.<ref name="factbook 2004 9">{{cite web|title=Disney Factbook 2004: Key Dates|url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/investors/fact_books/2004/disney_fb04.pdf|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|page=9|date=February 4, 2005|access-date=January 24, 2010}}</ref> However, ABC1 could not attain sustainable viewership<ref name="ABC1 closure">{{cite web|title=Disney Closes ABC1 in the United Kingdom |url=http://www.netcot.com/thesite/2007/09/08/disney-closes-abc1-in-the-united-kingdom/ |work=Netcot.com |date=September 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022632/http://www.netcot.com/thesite/2007/09/08/disney-closes-abc1-in-the-united-kingdom/ |archive-date=December 3, 2013}}</ref> and was shut down in October&nbsp;2007.<ref name="ABC1 closure"/>

Prior to the ABC1 closure, on October 10, 2006, Disney–ABC Television Group entered into an agreement with satellite provider [[Dish TV]] to carry its ABC News Now channel in India.<ref name="DishTv">{{cite news|url=https://deseretnews.com/article/650197444/India-will-get-ABC-News-Now.html|title=India will get ABC News Now|date=October 10, 2006|work=[[Deseret News]]|access-date=December 24, 2017}}</ref> However, this operation was not put into effect.

===Canada===
Most [[Canadians]] have access to at least one U.S.-based ABC affiliate, either over-the-air (in areas located within proximity of the [[Canada–United States border]]) or through a cable, satellite or [[IPTV]] provider. Most ABC programs are subject to [[simultaneous substitution]] regulations imposed by the CRTC, which require television service providers to replace an American station's signal with the feed of a [[Television in Canada|Canadian broadcaster]] carrying the same syndicated program to protect domestic programming rights and advertising revenue.
