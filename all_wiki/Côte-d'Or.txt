'''Côte-d'Or''' ({{IPA-fr|kot dɔʁ|IPA}}; literally, "Golden Slope"){{citation needed|date=October 2019}} is a [[Departments of France|department]] in the [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté]] [[Regions of France|region]] of Northeastern France. In 2016, it had a population of 533,213. Its [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] is [[Dijon]] and [[Subprefectures in France|subprefectures]] are [[Beaune]] and [[Montbard]].

== History ==

Côte-d'Or is one of the original 83 departments created during the [[French Revolution]] on 4 March 1790. It was formed from part of the former [[province of France|province]] of [[Burgundy (historical region)|Burgundy]].

== Geography ==

The department is part of the current [[regions of France|region]] of [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté]]. It is surrounded by the departments of [[Yonne]], [[Nièvre]], [[Saône-et-Loire]], [[Jura (department)|Jura]], [[Aube]], [[Haute-Saône]], and [[Haute-Marne]].

A chain of hills called the Plateau de Langres runs from north-east to south-west through the department to the north of Dijon and continues south-westwards as the [[Côte d'Or (escarpment)|Côte d'Or escarpment]], which takes its name from that of the department. It is the south-east facing slope of this [[escarpment]] which is the site of the celebrated [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] [[vineyard]]s. To the west of the Plateau de Langres, towards [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], lies the densely wooded district of Châtillonais. To the south-east of the plateau and escarpment, the department lies in the broad, flat-bottomed valley of the middle course of the [[River Saône|Saône]].

Rivers include: 
* The [[Saône]]
* The [[Seine]] rises in the southern end of the Plateau de Langres.
* The [[Ouche]] rises on the dip slope of the escarpment and flows to the Saône via Dijon.
* The [[Armançon]] rises on the dip slope of the escarpment and flows north-westward.
* The [[Arroux]] rises on the dip slope of the escarpment at the southern end of the department.

== Climate ==

The climate of the department is temperate, with abundant rain on the west side of the central range.

== Politics ==

The President of the General Council is [[François Sauvadet]] of the [[New Centre]].

== Economy ==
This is a premier [[wine-growing region]] of France. It produces what are arguably the world's finest, and definitely most expensive [[Pinot noir]] and [[Chardonnay]] wines from some of the most rigorously and painstakingly (thanks to the region's many monasteries) classified vineyards in the world. Wine from the Côte-d'Or was a favorite of the emperor Charlemagne. Other crops include cereal grains and potatoes. Sheep and cattle are also raised in the department. The region is famous for [[Dijon mustard]].

There are coal mines and heavy industry, including steel, machinery, and earthenware.
The industries most developed in Côte-d'Or are
* agriculture and food (14% of employees)
* metallurgy and metal manufacture (12% of employees)
* chemicals, rubber and plastics (12% of employees)
* pharmacy
* electrical and electronic components and equipment
* wood and paper industries.
The big works are generally in the conurbation of Dijon although biggest (CEA Valduc) is at [[Salives]] in the Plateau de Langres. There is also the SEB metal works at Selongey below the plateau on the margin of the Saône plain and the Valourec metalworking group at [[Montbard]] in the west of the department on the River Brenne near its confluence with the Armançon.
The [[Pharmaceutical industry]] has shown the greatest growth in recent years.
However, since the Dijon employment statistics zone includes the urban and administrative centre of the [[Bourgogne|Burgundy region]], the [[service sector]] is proportionately bigger there in relation to the industrial, than in the other three zones of Côte-d'Or.
