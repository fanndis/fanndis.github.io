'''DreamWorks Records''' (often referred in copyright notices as '''SKG Music, LLC''') was an [[United States|American]] [[record label]] founded in 1996 by [[David Geffen]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] as a subsidiary of [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks SKG]]. The label operated until 2003 when it was sold to [[Universal Music Group]]. The label itself also featured a [[Nashville, Tennessee]]-based subsidiary, DreamWorks Nashville, which specialized in [[country music]] and was shut down in 2006. The company's logo was designed by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and was his last commission before his death in 1997.

== History ==
In 1996, six years after Geffen sold [[Geffen Records]] to [[Universal Music Group|MCA Music Entertainment]], he joined Spielberg and Katzenberg to form DreamWorks SKG,<ref>Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', p. 538, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref> which included the subsidiary DreamWorks Records. The logo for the label was the last project completed by artist [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. The distinctive design, incorporating musical notes in the artist's trademark "dream balloon," debuted on the packaging for "Beautiful Freak," the first album from Los Angeles-based [[Eels (band)|Eels]] and the second release from the record company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18598870.html |title=Artist Roy Lichtenstein Designs Logo For DreamWorks Records |access-date=2011-09-02}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Geffen Records distributed DreamWorks until 1999, when [[Interscope Records]] took over distribution duties (meanwhile, as Interscope and Geffen switched international distribution to [[Polydor Records]], DreamWorks followed suit). [[Rufus Wainwright]] was the first to be signed to the new label in early 1996. [[Henry Rollins]] (both as a spoken-word artist and with [[Rollins Band]]), [[Tamar Braxton]], [[Nelly Furtado]], [[George Michael]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Morphine (band)|Morphine]], [[Eels (band)|Eels]], comedian/actor [[Chris Rock]], [[Powerman 5000]], [[Elliott Smith]], [[Papa Roach]] and others were also signed to the label. The label was presided over by [[Lenny Waronker]] and [[Mo Ostin]], who had run [[Warner Bros. Records]] until the mid-1990s. Ostin stated at the time: "What you find in the record business is there is more and more a trend toward corporate control, corporate values, and here you’re dealing with a creatively oriented operation."<ref name="aug01">https://hitsdailydouble.com/news&id=274756&title+DREAMWORKS-IS-FOR-REAL</ref> 

It was announced on November 11, 2003 that [[Universal Music Group]] (the former MCA Music Entertainment, and parent of Interscope, Geffen, and Polydor) reached an agreement to acquire DreamWorks Records from [[DreamWorks SKG]] for "about $100 million".<ref name="billboard1">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68395/umg-to-acquire-dreamworks-records |title=UMG To Acquire DreamWorks Records |publisher=Billboard |date=2013-08-17 |access-date=2013-09-15}}</ref> The purchase came at a time when the music business was "going through major changes" as it struggled to "counter falling sales and the impact of unofficial online music sales". Mo Ostin, the principal executive at DreamWorks Records, said: "Despite the challenges of the music business today, Universal is acquiring a wonderful asset and the sale will assure the strongest possible future for our artists".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3262215.stm |title=Business &#124; Universal buys Dreamworks Records |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-11-11 |access-date=2013-09-15}}</ref> Under the new deal, DreamWorks Records was placed within the [[Interscope Geffen A&M Records|Interscope Geffen A&M]] label, under the direction of [[Jimmy Iovine]].<ref name="billboard1"/> DreamWorks was folded into [[Geffen Records]] in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universalmusic.com/corporate/detail/334|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126045652/http://www.universalmusic.com/corporate/detail/334|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-26|title=JORDAN SCHUR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH INTERSCOPE RECORDS LAUNCHES SURETONE RECORDS|date=2013-01-26|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref>

Its country music division, which began in June 1997, remained operational until January 29, 2006, when it was shut down by [[Universal Music Group Nashville]].<ref name="aug01"/>

== DreamWorks Nashville ==
Between 1997 and 2006, DreamWorks also operated a division in Nashville, Tennessee for country music acts. Among the artists signed to the DreamWorks Nashville division were [[Jessica Andrews]], [[Emerson Drive]], [[Toby Keith]], [[Randy Travis]], [[Jimmy Wayne]], and [[Darryl Worley]]. After DreamWorks Records' dissolution, former executive [[Scott Borchetta]] formed [[Big Machine Records]] in late 2005, signing several country music acts to the label. Borchetta also signed Show Dog Records in partnership with Toby Keith,<ref>[https://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4555537-1.html All Business:''Nashville Scene: Keith's New Show Dog''] By PHYLLIS STARK, September 10, 2005</ref> although Keith dropped his association with the latter label in 2006. Meanwhile, Borchetta signed Taylor Swift to DreamWorks Records. The latter label merged with Universal South Records to become [[Show Dog-Universal Music]].
