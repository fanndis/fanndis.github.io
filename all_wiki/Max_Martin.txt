==Life and career==
===Early career and It's Alive===
Sandberg was born and grew up in [[Stenhamra]], [[Ekerö Municipality]], [[Stockholm County]]. As a child, Martin was a student of Sweden's public music-education program, and once said he had "public music education to thank for everything".<ref>{{cite web|last=Moser |first=Whet |url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/swedish-pop-mafia-music-world-influence-73966 |title=Swedish Pop Mafia – Pacific Standard: The Science of Society |publisher=Psmag.com |date=24 March 2014 |accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> Other alumni of the program include [[Andreas Carlsson]], [[Rami Yacoub]], and [[Anders Bagge]].

As a teenager he sang in a variety of bands before joining a [[Glam metal|glam-style]] metal band called [[It's Alive (band)|It's Alive]] in 1985 as their singer and frontman. It's Alive was formed by ex-LAZY members [[Per Aldeheim]] and Kim Björkgren on guitars, and John Rosth who had been a member of Lineout. Martin eventually dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music with his band under the nickname "Martin White". In 1988 they participated in the national rock championships and played as the in-house band at a disco in [[Cyprus]]. The band got a breakthrough in 1991, as Dave Constable of [[Megarock Records]] offered them to make a demo-record. The later debut album was originally pressed in 1,000 copies and later on given away as a free cover tape in the UK by the ''[[Metal Forces]]'' magazine.

The decision to focus on a music career paid off as they landed a record deal on producer [[Denniz PoP]]'s label [[Cheiron Studios|Cheiron Records]], a [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] affiliate. After recording their second album ''[[Earthquake Visions]]'', they released three singles in conjunction with the record and toured through Europe in 1994 supporting [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]]. ''Earthquake Visions'' eventually sold a disappointing 30,000 copies, despite being released in as many as 30 countries. More importantly though, Martin also began collaborating on songs with PoP. Recognizing a talent for writing pop songs in the young rocker, PoP renamed his new protégé Max Martin and eventually became Martin's mentor.

===Working with Cheiron and Denniz PoP===
{{quote box|width=23em|I didn't even know what a producer did, I spent two years–day and night–in that studio trying to learn what the hell was going on.|salign=right|source=—Max Martin, 19 March 2001.<ref>Chu, Jeff (19 March 2001) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160302064227/http://maxmartinfansite.com/Time-Top%20of%20the%20Pops.htm "Top of the Pops"]. ''Time'', vol. 157 no. 11</ref>}}

In 1993, Martin was hired by [[Cheiron Studios]] and spent some time learning the basics, before the first production collaboration between PoP and Martin: the [[Rednex]] song "[[Wish You Were Here (Rednex Song)|Wish You Were Here]]" in 1994. They both worked on [[Ace of Base]]'s second album, ''[[The Bridge (Ace of Base album)|The Bridge]]'' (1995), shortly thereafter, as well as on albums by [[3T]], [[Army of Lovers]] and [[Leila K]]. To date, ''The Bridge'' has sold more than six million copies worldwide, including one million in the United States.<ref name="Ace of Base's USA Certifications">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ace%20of%20Base&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=Gold & Platinum Search Results: Ace of Base|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=1 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151657/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ace%20of%20Base&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref> When Martin eventually left his band [[It's Alive (band)|It's Alive]] in late 1995, he was replaced by [[Anders Hansson (songwriter)|Anders Hansson]].

In 1995, the Cheiron Studios was hired by [[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] to work on Backstreet Boys' self-titled debut album ''[[Backstreet Boys (1996 album)|Backstreet Boys]]'' (1996). [[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] became the main working partner since the success in 1995. Martin took part in the production of "[[Quit Playing Games (with My Heart)]]" (1996), co-written with [[Herbie Crichlow]], a single which quickly went [[Platinum single|platinum]] and climbed to No.&nbsp;2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as the singles "[[As Long as You Love Me (Backstreet Boys song)|As Long As You Love Me]]" (1997) and "[[Everybody (Backstreet's Back)]]" (1997). The album was not released in the U.S. until 1997, but was released overseas and caught on all across Europe, eventually selling around 8&nbsp;million copies worldwide. This led to the Backstreet Boys being relaunched in their home country later on, this time more successfully.<ref>As of late May 2016, Martin was not known to have possessed any knowledge of the illegal activities of [[Lou Pearlman]], who then managed the Backstreet Boys.</ref> Later that year, Martin co-wrote and co-produced [[Robyn]]'s hits "[[Show Me Love (Robyn song)|Show Me Love]]" and "[[Do You Know (What It Takes)]]" which ended up on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 top 10.<ref name=Ostroff/>

In 1998, [[Cheiron Productions]] worked on albums by [[Five (band)|Five]] and [[Jessica Folcker]]. Jessica Folcker had first been hired as a backing singer for tracks with Ace of Base and [[Dr. Alban]], and her debut album ''Jessica'' became an instant hit with singles like "Tell Me What You Like" and "How Will I Know Who You Are" which both sold [[Platinum record|platinum]]. After Denniz PoP died of cancer that same summer, Martin took over as director of Cheiron Studios. He soon started working with writer/producer [[Rami Yacoub]], who continued to be his partner for many years. Martin also wrote two songs with [[Bryan Adams]] during this time, "Cloud Number Nine" and "Before The Night Is Over".

In late 1999, [[Celine Dion]] released "[[That's the Way It Is (Celine Dion song)|That's the Way It Is]]", a song co-written by Max Martin to promote her [[greatest hits]] album ''[[All the Way... A Decade of Song]].'' The song became a hit, going to number 1 on the adult contemporary charts in the United States and Canada, and reaching top 10 all over the world. Since the song was released in November 1999, it has cycled 500,000 times on almost 1400 radio stations across Canada and the U.S.
In 2003 Martin co-wrote and produced three songs for Dion's album ''[[One Heart]].'' One of them, called "[[Faith (Celine Dion song)|Faith]]", was released in 2003 as a promotional single in Canada and reached number 4 on the Quebec Airplay Chart and number 37 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart.

Martin, Andreas Carlsson, and Rami Yacoub wrote [[Westlife]]'s song "I Need You" for the first Westlife album ''[[Westlife (album)|Westlife]]'' (1999). Martin, Nick Jarl, Steve Mac, and Patric Jonsson wrote Westlife's song "[[You Make Me Feel (Westlife song)|You Make Me Feel]]" for their second album ''[[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]]'' (2000). Max Martin, [[Rami Yacoub]], and Andreas Carlsson also wrote one of Westlife's hits, "[[When You're Looking Like That]]", for their second album ''[[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]]'' (2000).

===Backstreet Boys===
Martin wrote, co-wrote, and co-produced 7 out of the 12 songs on the Backstreet Boys' third album ''[[Millennium (Backstreet Boys album)|Millennium]]'' (1999), including all the singles. "[[I Want It That Way]]", a hit song Martin co-wrote with [[Andreas Carlsson]] and co-produced with [[Kristian Lundin]], became the group's biggest single to date and it is still popular today. ("I Want It That Way" was voted No. 10 in the [[MTV]]/[[Rolling Stone]] list of the "100 Greatest Pop Songs".<ref name="mtvrollinstones100best">{{cite web

A VH1 special, 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s, ranked the song at number 3, making it the highest ranked boy-band single and pop song. ''Millennium'' sold over 1.1&nbsp;million units in its first week in the United States, setting a record for most albums sold in its debut week (that record was later beaten by [[NSYNC|NSYNC's]] 2000 album ''[[No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)|No Strings Attached]]''), and was the best-selling album in the world. When working on her own solo album, to be released in 2001 on [[Stockholm Records]], [[Lisa Miskovsky]] wrote the lyrics for the Backstreet Boys' hit single "[[Shape of My Heart (Backstreet Boys song)|Shape of My Heart]]" with Max Martin and Rami. The song, originally written for Miskovsky's own album, was passed on to the Backstreet Boys by Max Martin when Miskovsky decided that it did not fit her style. The song became the first single off the group's fourth album ''[[Black & Blue (Backstreet Boys album)|Black & Blue]]'' (2000). In the first week of release, "[[Shape of My Heart (Backstreet Boys song)|Shape of My Heart]]" immediately jumped into the Top Five in Sweden, Norway, Canada, Germany and another 15 countries. ''Black & Blue'', containing several songs produced and written by Martin, sold 1.6&nbsp;million units in its first week in America. Martin again received [[ASCAP]]'s award "Songwriter of the Year" both in 2000 and 2001.<ref>{{cite web | title=Songwriters Behind 'NSYNC, Backstreet Boys Hits Win Big At ASCAP Pop Awards | url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443980/20010523/backstreet_boys.jhtml |date=23 May 2001 | author=Schumacher-Rasmussen, Eric | publisher=MTV | accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> In April 2013 the Backstreet Boys member [[Brian Littrell]] invited Martin to collaborate on their single "[[In A World Like This]]". The single peaked at ''No.6'' in the ''[[Oricon Singles Chart|Oricon]]'' chart and performed well in the rest of the world. Martin collaborated on the ''Never Gone'' songs "Climbing the Walls", "[[Just Want You to Know]]", "Siberia" and "[[I Still...]]". Martin wanted the album to be more of a contemporary, alternative pop album with a little R&B. The resulting album had a more organic music style with more live instruments, and was a departure from the Backstreet Boys' earlier work.

===Britney Spears===

In 1998, Martin wrote and co-produced [[Britney Spears|Spears]]' debut single, "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]", for her debut album of the [[...Baby One More Time (album)|same name]]. The single was originally offered to the [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[TLC (music)|TLC]], though both passed on the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051216/ai_n15946023| title = Rock&Pop: Story of the song '...Baby One More Time'| accessdate = 19 May 2007| publisher = Findarticles.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021053000/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051216/ai_n15946023 |archivedate = 21 October 2007}}</ref> That same year, Martin also co-wrote and co-produced the third single "[[(You Drive Me) Crazy]]". By 1999, the album ''...Baby One More Time'' had sold over 15&nbsp;million copies in the U.S., certifying [[Music recording sales certification|Diamond Status]]. Also, within a year of its release, ''...Baby One More Time'' had become the best-selling [[Compact disc|LP]] by a teenager in history, selling over 30&nbsp;million copies. Martin was the first non-American citizen ever to win ASCAP's prestigious award "Songwriter of the Year" in 1999, an award he also won in 2000 and 2001.

Martin worked on Spears's follow-up records ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000) and ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001). He co-wrote and co-produced the singles "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]" (2000), "[[Lucky (Britney Spears song)|Lucky]]" (2000), "[[Stronger (Britney Spears song)|Stronger]]" (2000), "[[Overprotected]]" (2001), and "[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]" (2002). The duo ended up parting ways when Spears distanced herself from [[teen pop]]. Spears recorded ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003) and ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007). At the request of Spears, Martin produced and wrote for Spears' sixth studio album ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008). Martin co-wrote and produced the provocatively titled electro pop song, "[[If U Seek Amy]]", which was chosen by fans to be the third single of the album. Martin then produced the number one hit, "[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]", for Spears' compilation album ''[[The Singles Collection (Britney Spears album)|The Singles Collection]]'' (2009).

Martin was one of the executive producers of Spears's seventh album, ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011). He produced several songs for the album, including the successful singles "[[Hold It Against Me]]", "[[Till the World Ends]]", "[[I Wanna Go]]", and "[[Criminal (Britney Spears song)|Criminal]]".<ref name=confirm>{{cite web|url=http://www.britney.com/us/blog/britney-confirms-i-wanna-go-next-single |title=Britney Confirms 'I Wanna Go' As Next Single |publisher=Britney.com |author=BRITannica |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517204859/http://www.britney.com/us/blog/britney-confirms-i-wanna-go-next-single |archivedate=17 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1668729/will-drop-dead-beautiful-be-britney-spears-next-single.jhtml|title=Will '(Drop Dead) Beautiful' Be Britney Spears' Next Single?|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011|publisher=MTV.

===Startup of Maratone===
Following the death of [[Denniz PoP]], [[Cheiron Studios]] was closed down in 2000. Martin and Tom Talomaa then started a new production company named [[Maratone]] in January 2001 and moved into the famous [[Cosmos Studios]] building. The first songs to be written and produced at Maratone were four tracks for [[Britney Spears]]'s album, ''Britney (album)'' (2001). The Maratone production crew initially consisted of producers/songwriters Max Martin, Rami, Alexandra, [[Arnthor Birgisson]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]. Following the work with [[Celine Dion]] on the album ''[[One Heart]]'' in 2003, few new hits appeared from Maratone until 2005.

In 2004, [[Kelly Clarkson]] traveled to Sweden to collaborate with Martin and [[Luke Gottwald|Dr. Luke]] on her second studio album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]''. These collaborations resulted in the rock-influenced singles "[[Since U Been Gone]]" (2004) and "[[Behind These Hazel Eyes]]" (2005). In 2009, Martin co-wrote Clarkson's single "[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]", which was a number one hit.

In 2005, Martin collaborated with the Norwegian singer [[Marion Raven]] for the release of her debut album, titled ''[[Here I Am (Marion Raven album)|Here I Am]],'' writing and co-writing the songs "[[Break You]]", "[[End of Me (Marion Raven song)|End of Me]]", "Here I Am", "Little By Little", "In Spite of Me", and "Six Feet Under".

===Pink===
Martin co-wrote and produced three songs on [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]'s platinum-selling album ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'', including the singles, "[[U + Ur Hand]]" (2006), "[[Who Knew]]" (2006), and "[['Cuz I Can (Pink song)|Cuz I Can]]" (2007). Martin also collaborated with Pink for her next album, ''[[Funhouse (Pink album)|Funhouse]]'' (2008). Martin co-wrote the first smash hit single, "[[So What (Pink song)|So What]]" (2008), plus the singles "[[Please Don't Leave Me]]" (2009) and "[[I Don't Believe You]]" (2009). The duo wrote "[[Whataya Want From Me]]" during the sessions for ''Funhouse'', but ultimately the song was recorded and released as a single by [[Adam Lambert]]. Later, Martin co-wrote hits for Pink including "[[Raise Your Glass]]" (2010), "[[Fuckin' Perfect]]" (2011), and "[[Just like Fire]]" (2016), for various Pink-related projects. For her seventh studio album, ''[[Beautiful Trauma]]'' (2017), he co-wrote "[[Revenge (Pink song)|Revenge]]", "[[Whatever You Want (Pink song)|Whatever You Want]]", "For Now", and "Secrets". In 2019 for her eighth studio album, ''[[Hurts 2B Human]]'' (2019), he co-wrote "(Hey Why) Miss You Sometime".

===Usher===
In 2010, Martin co-wrote and co-produced [[Usher (singer)|Usher]]'s song "[[DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love]]" that went number-one on the US [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic]] charts and top-ten on the main Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/430708/Usher/chart?f=378|title=Usher – Chart history|website=www.billboard.com|access-date=4 April 2016}}</ref> Working together again, Martin co-wrote and co-produced on Usher's seventh studio album "[[Looking 4 Myself]]" in 2012 making the [[dance-pop]] song "[[Scream (Usher song)|Scream]]" that went number-one on the US [[Dance Club Songs]] chart and number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Usher&ti=Scream#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum – RIAA|website=RIAA|language=en-US|access-date=4 April 2016}}</ref>

==Artistry==
===Influences===
When accepting the [[Polar Music Prize]], Martin highlighted [[ABBA]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Lasse Holm]] as inspirations.<ref>"[http://www.polarmusicprize.org/laureates/max-martin/ Max Martin]", polarmusicprize.org, 2016. Retrieved 28 August 2016.</ref>

===Creative process===
The traditional division of work in the record industry often has the artist or songwriter writing the songs and then hiring a producer to help shape the sound. But at Cheiron, it was the other way around; the producers wrote the songs, played the instruments, and engineered and mixed the recordings, and the artist was only brought in near the end of the process to do the vocals. For example, on Britney Spears's second album ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!… I Did It Again]]'' (2000), Cheiron had already written seven songs and had proceeded to record the layers of music before Britney even arrived at the studios in early November 1999. It took her only one week to do the vocals. Martin and his team worked more like a band that alternated singers. Martin explained his working method:
{{cquote|I want to be part of every note, every single moment going on in the studio. I want nothing forgotten, I want nothing missed. I'm a perfectionist. The producer should decide what kind of music is being made, what it's going to sound like–all of it, the why, when and how.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maxmartinfansite.com/CyptronLATimes.htm |title=Practicing the Fine Art of Production |publisher=maxmartinfansite.com |accessdate=4 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302064309/http://maxmartinfansite.com/CyptronLATimes.htm |archivedate=2 March 2016 }}</ref> – LA Times, 6/05/00}}

===Impact and legacy===
Martin's influence on the music field is also seen in the effect he has had on co-producers. The music site ''[[Stereogum]]'' singles out three people as his "disciples", [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Dr. Luke]], and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]].<ref>{{cite web|title=30 Essential Max Martin Songs|url= http://www.stereogum.com/1788251/30-essential-max-martin-songs/franchises/ultimate-playlist/|author=Nelson, Michael |date=26 March 2015|publisher=Stereogum}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that "There's a cluster of high-powered songwriters who are based in Sweden, and the grandmaster is Max Martin and that when Kotecha worked with [[One Direction]] he credited Martin's influence 'We work melody first. That's Max Martin's school. We’ll spend days, sometimes weeks, challenging the melody. The goal is to make it sound like anyone can do this, but it's actually very difficult. In Sweden, you don’t do anything until you do it right.'"<ref>{{cite magazine|title=One Direction's Songwriters: They’re What Make the Boy Band Beautiful|author=Wolk, Douglas |date=13 November 2012|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/11/13/one-directions-songwriters-theyre-what-make-the-boy-band-beautiful/|magazine=Time Magazine}}</ref> [[The New Yorker]] reported that Martin was Dr. Luke's "Swedish mentor and frequent collaborator. If Luke is the Skywalker of pop songcraft, Max is the Obi-Wan: the reclusive master. ...The vital spark in the musical emergence of Dr. Luke was meeting Max Martin".<ref name=Seabrook/> Dr. Luke himself says of the chemistry between him and Martin "'It happened really fast. It was magical. …[Martin taught me that] Instead of making tracks for five thousand people, why not make tracks for a million?'"<ref name=Seabrook>{{cite magazine|title=The Doctor Is In: A technique for producing No. 1 songs|date=14 October 2013|author=Seabrook, John |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/10/14/the-doctor-is-in|magazine=The New Yorker}}</ref> The magazine for Sweden's [[copyright collective|collection society]] [[STIM]] reported that Shellback became an "apprentice" with Martin acting as "his mentor" at Maratone Studios after 2006 when "Max Martin saw something special in the young man from [[Karlshamn]]. Judging by the incredible success Shellback has had since, Martin's A&R skills are some of the best in the music business".<ref>{{cite web|title= Shellback – The metal head apprentice who set the pop world on fire|date=30 January 2013|url=http://www.stim.se/en/PRESS/Portraits/Shellback--The-metal-head-apprentice-who-set-the-pop-world-on-fire/}}{{subscription required}}</ref>
