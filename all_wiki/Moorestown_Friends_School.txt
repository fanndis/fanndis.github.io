== History ==
[[File:George Fox.jpg|thumbnail|right|George Fox, founder of Quakerism.]]

In 1781, a two-acre lot, located near the intersection of Chester Avenue and Main Street, was purchased. In 1785, a stone schoolhouse was erected and [[Esther Hunt|Joshua Hunt]] was the first teacher.<ref>Hartman, p. 4:<br>"Two years later, in 12th Month, 1781, the Elders and Overseers of Chester Preparative Meeting bought from Ephraim Haines a piece of ground on which to build a school house."<br>"On this piece of ground a stone schoolhouse was erected, some time in the year 1785."<br>"The stone structure which was the original Moorestown Friends' School remained unchanged for nearly one hundred years."</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfriends.org/07/about_history.php |title=About MFS History |accessdate=August 16, 2008 |publisher=Moorestown Friends School }}</ref><ref>Woodward, p. 270:<br>"Joshua, son of Robert and Martha Hunt, was born Feb. 1, 1753. His wife, Esther, a daughter of Enoch Roberts, born Sept. 4, 1751, died Feb. 5, 1820. Joshua Hunt resided in Moorestown most of his life, and was the first teacher in the Friends' school in the old stone school-house. In 1790 he removed with his family to Redstone Fort, now called Brownsville, Pa., and there died the next year."</ref> In 1784, a lot at the western side of the community was purchased and a brick schoolhouse was erected.<ref>Hartman, p. 4:<br>"In 1784 another lot had been bought at the western end of the settlement near William Matlack's farm, and a brick school was erected at about the same time as the stone house."</ref>

Once selected by the Camden Scholars Committee and admitted, students receive a scholarship that provides virtually full tuition to MFS. Camden Scholars are encouraged to pursue their interests and develop their talents. Camden Scholars participate in clubs, serve as student leaders, are athletes and perform in plays. They go on overnight retreats and field trips.

Accessed September 7, 2013.</ref>

===Meeting for Worship===
Each week, the MFS community gathers in the Meetinghouse, built in 1802, for Meeting for Worship. There are separate Meetings for each school division.

Friends believe that each person has within him/herself, with God's help, the ability to discern truth. Participants use this time to pray, or worship or simply reflect deeply on the world around them, according to their own faith traditions.

Since Friends believe that each person, no matter their age, is able to discern truth, all are welcome to speak from their hearts if so moved. It is expected that their words will be listened to from the same deep connection to the Spirit and provide insight for the listeners. When the Meeting for Worship is over, students on the facing benches close the Meeting by shaking hands. At this point everyone is invited to briefly greet their neighbor before settling back into quiet for dismissal.<ref>[http://www.moorestownfriends.com/07/about_quaker_meeting.php Meeting for Worship] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130907205957/http://www.moorestownfriends.com/07/about_quaker_meeting.php |date=September 7, 2013 }}.

===The Examined Life===
[[File:Socrates teaching.jpg|thumbnail|Socrates teaching.]]
The phrase "Examined Life" is drawn from [[Socrates]]' axiom: "The unexamined life is not worth living." The goal of such a life is to integrate a tough mind and a tender heart.<ref>[http://www.moorestownfriends.com/07/about_quaker_examined.php The Examined Life] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130907211639/http://www.moorestownfriends.com/07/about_quaker_examined.php |date=September 7, 2013 }}.
