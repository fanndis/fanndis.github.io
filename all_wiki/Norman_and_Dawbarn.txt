'''Norman and Dawbarn''' (styled Norman & Dawbarn, and later, Norman + Dawbarn) was a British architectural and engineering practice, established in 1934. 

==History==
The practice was formed by [[Graham Dawbarn]] and [[Nigel Norman]] in 1934. The practice was preceded by Norman, Muntz & Dawbarn, formed with [[Alan Muntz]].
