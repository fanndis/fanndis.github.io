In [[justice]] and [[law]], '''house arrest''' (also called '''home confinement''', '''home detention''', or, in modern times, '''[[Electronic monitoring in the United States|electronic monitoring]]''') is a measure by which a person is confined by the authorities to their [[House|residence]]. [[Travel]] is usually restricted, if allowed at all. House arrest is an alternative to being in a [[prison]] while awaiting trial or after sentencing.

While house arrest can be applied to criminal cases when prison does not seem an appropriate measure, the term is often applied to the use of house confinement as a measure of repression by [[authoritarian]] governments against political [[dissident]]s. In these cases, the person under house arrest often does not have access to any means of communication with people outside of the home; if electronic communication is allowed, conversations may be monitored.

==History==
Judges have imposed sentences of home confinement, as an alternative to prison, as far back as the 17th century. [[Galileo]] was confined to his home following his [[Galileo affair|infamous trial]] in 1633. Authorities often used house arrest to confine political leaders who were deposed in a coup d'état, but this method was not widely used to confine numerous common criminals.

This method did not become a widespread alternative to imprisonment in the United States and other western countries until the late 20th century, when newly designed electronic monitoring devices made it inexpensive and easy to manage by corrections authorities. Although Boston was using house arrest for a variety of arrangements, the first-ever court sentence of house arrest with an [[electronic bracelet]] was in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2209984/ |work=Slate Magazine |title=You're Grounded!

==Details==
Home detention is an alternative to [[Incarceration|imprisonment]]; its goals are both to reduce recidivism and to decrease the number of prisoners, thereby saving money for states and other jurisdictions. It is a corrective to mandatory sentencing laws that greatly increased the incarceration rates in the United States.<ref name=lev>Levinson, David. (2002). ''Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment: Volumes I-IV.'' SAGE Publications. p. 859. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-2258-2}}</ref> It allows eligible offenders to retain or seek employment, maintain family relationships and responsibilities and attend rehabilitative programs that contribute towards addressing the causes of their offending.

The terms of house arrest can differ, but most programs allow employed offenders to continue to work, and confine them to their residence only during non-working hours. Offenders are commonly allowed to leave their home for specific purposes; examples can include visits to the [[probation officer]] or police station, religious services, education, attorney visits, court appearances, and medical appointments.<ref>Spohn, Cassia. (2008). ''How Do Judges Decide?: The Search for Fairness and Justice in Punishment.'' SAGE Publications Inc. p. 52. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-6104-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-19/strauss-kahn-granted-bail-pending-trial-in-hotel-maid-sexual-assault-case.html|title=Strauss-Kahn May Have Spent Last Night in Jail After Bail|author=Karen Freifeld, Chris Dolmetsch and Don Jeffrey|date=20 May 2011|work=Bloomberg.com}}</ref> Many programs also allow the convict to leave their residence during regular, pre-approved times in order to carry out general household errands, such as food shopping and laundry. Offenders may have to respond to communications from a higher authority to verify that they are at home when required to be. Exceptions are often made to allow visitors to visit the offender.<ref>Mele, Christopher. (2005). ''Civil Penalties, Social Consequences.'' Routledge. p. 139. {{ISBN|978-0-415-94823-4}}</ref>

The types of house arrest vary in severity according to the requirements of the court order. A [[curfew]] may restrict an offender to their house at certain times, usually during hours of darkness. "Home confinement" or detention requires an offender to remain at home at all times, apart from the above-mentioned exceptions. The most serious level of house arrest is "home incarceration", under which an offender is restricted to their residence 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for court-approved treatment programs, court appearances, and medical appointments.<ref name=lev/>

In some exceptional cases, it is possible for a person to be placed under house arrest without [[Trial (law)|trial]] or [[Lawyer|legal representation]], and subject to restrictions on their associates.<ref>Jupp, James; Nieuwenhuysen, John; Dawson, Emma. (2007). ''Social Cohesion in Australia.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 183. {{ISBN|978-0-521-70943-9}}</ref> In some countries this type of detention without trial has been criticized for breaching the offender's [[human rights|human right]] to a fair trial.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4715478.stm "Q&A: Terrorism laws"]. BBC News Online. July 3, 2006</ref> In countries with authoritarian systems of government, the government may use such measures to stifle dissent.

==Using technology for enforcement==
In some countries, house arrest is enforced through the use of technology products or services.  One method is an electronic sensor locked around the offender's ankle (technically called an [[ankle monitor]], also referred to as a [[tether]]). The electronic sensor transmits an [[RF]] signal to a base handset. The base handset is connected to a police station or for-profit monitoring service.

If the offender goes too far from their home, the violation is recorded, and the police will be notified. To discourage tampering, many ankle monitors detect attempted removal. The monitoring service is often contracted out to private companies, which assign employees to electronically monitor many convicts simultaneously. If a violation occurs the unit signals the office or officer in charge immediately, depending on the severity of the violation. The officer will either call or verify the participant's whereabouts.<ref>http://www.digitaltechnologies-2000.com/?page_id=459{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The monitoring service notifies a convict's probation officer. The electronic surveillance together with frequent contact with their probation officer and checks by the security guards provides for a secure environment.

Another method of ensuring house arrest compliance is achieved through the use of automated calling services that require no human contact to check on the offender. Random calls are made to the residence. The  respondent's answer is recorded and compared automatically to the offender's voice pattern. Authorities are notified only if the call is not answered or if the recorded answer does not match the offender's voice pattern.

[[Electronic tagging|Electronic monitoring]] is considered a highly economical alternative to the cost of imprisoning offenders. In many states or jurisdictions, the convict is often required to pay for the monitoring as part of his or her sentence.

===Italy===
In Italy, house arrest (in Italian ''arresti domiciliari'') is a common practice of [[Remand (detention)|detaining suspects]], as an alternative to detention in a correctional facility, and is also commonly practiced on those felons who are close to the end of their prison terms, or for those whose health condition does not allow residence in a correctional facility, except some particular cases of extremely dangerous persons. As per article 284 of the Italian Penal Procedure Code, house arrest is imposed by a judge, who orders the suspect to stay confined in his house, home, residence, private property, or any other place of cure or assistance where he/she may be housed at the moment. When necessary, the judge may also forbid any contact between the subject and any person other than those who cohabit with him/her or who assist him/her. If the subject is unable to take care of his/her life necessities or if he/she is in conditions of absolute poverty, the judge may authorize him/her to leave his/her home for the strict necessary time to take care of said needs or to exercise a job. The prosecuting authorities and law enforcement can check at any moment whether the subject, who is ''[[de facto]]'' considered in state of detention, is complying with the order; violation of house arrest terms is immediately followed by transfer to a correctional facility. House arrests cannot be applied to a subject that has been found guilty of [[Prison escape|escape]] within the previous five years.

Notable cases:
* [[Erich Priebke]], former [[SS]] captain, condemned for war crimes ([[Ardeatine massacre]] in Rome on 24 March 1944, when 335 Italian civilians were killed by Nazi force of occupation) to life imprisonment in 1996, spent under house arrest for the last part of his life, from 1998 to 2013 (when he died age of 100).
* [[Adriano Sofri]], journalist and former far left political leader, convicted in 1997 for the murder of Police Officer [[Luigi Calabresi]] (1972), spent under house arrest, for health reasons, the period between 2005 and 2012.

* Giovanni Scattone and Salvatore Ferraro, convicted for manslaughter of [[Marta Russo]], spent a period of their sentence under house arrest and community service.

===New Zealand===
At sentencing, the judge may sentence an offender to home detention where they would otherwise receive a short-term prison sentence (i.e. two years or less). Home detention sentences range from 14 days and 12 months; offenders are confined to their approved residence 24 hours a day and may only leave with the permission of their probation officer.

Electronic monitoring equipment is extensively used by the [[New Zealand Department of Corrections]] to ensure that convicted offenders subject to home detention remain within approved areas. This takes the form of a Global Positioning System tracker fitted to the offender's ankle and monitoring units located at their residence and place of employment. {{as of|2015}} over three thousand persons were serving home detention sentences under GPS surveillance.
* [[Phil Rudd]], two-time drummer with Australian rock legends [[AC/DC]], was sentenced to eight months' home detention at his waterfront mansion in [[Tauranga]] for charges relating to [[methamphetamine]] possession and making [[death threats]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/acdcs-phil-rudd-sentenced-to-house-detention-for-eight-months-201597|title=AC/DC's Phil Rudd Sentenced to House Detention for Eight Months|work=Us Weekly}}</ref>
