"'''Do What U Want'''" is<!--DO NOT change to "was" when the original version still exists whether available through retailers and streaming services or not--> a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]], featuring guest vocals from [[R. Kelly]]. The song was released on October 21, 2013 as the second single from Gaga's third studio album ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013). The singers wrote the song with [[DJ White Shadow]], [[Tchami|Martin Bresso]], and [[DJ Snake|William Grigahcine]]. DJ White Shadow first presented Gaga with the song's initial concept two years prior to its release. Production on "Do What U Want" was completed in 2013, with Kelly's vocals added soon after. Its sudden popularity upon premiering led to the song becoming the album's second single.

It is a [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song featuring 1980s-style synthesizers and an [[Electronic music|electronic]] instrumental track. The song's lyrics discuss the media's appetite for publishing opinion and critique, with Gaga telling detractors that her thoughts, dreams, and feelings are her own, no matter what one does with her body. Critics praised the song's simplicity and production. The [[Album cover|single cover]] for "Do What U Want", a close-up of Gaga's buttocks in a floral thong, was photographed by [[Terry Richardson]] who had also directed the song's music video. The clip was planned to be released through [[BitTorrent]] in December 2013 but was cancelled for unknown reasons.

"Do What U Want" reached number one in Hungary while peaking within the top 10 in Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Norway, Scotland, South Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom as well as the top 20 in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. Live performances of the song were televised on the [[2013 American Music Awards]], ''[[Alan Carr: Chatty Man]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', America's ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]'', and Britain's ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]''. Several remixes of the song were released, including ones with vocals from [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Rick Ross]].

On January 10, 2019, Gaga had the single removed from music streaming services after the airing of a [[television documentary]], ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]'', exposed new allegations of [[sexual misconduct]] and [[sexual assault|assault]] by Kelly, who had previously been charged regarding [[R. Kelly#Allegations of child pornography and abuse|similar accusations in 2002]] but was [[Acquittal|acquitted]] in 2008. The song was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019.

<blockquote>
I've been living in Chicago and spending a lot of time there, and that's where R. Kelly hails from. I was working on ''Artpop'' and I wrote ['Do What U Want'] on tour. It was about my obsession with the way people view me. I have always been an R. Kelly fan and actually it is like an epic pastime in the Haus of Gaga that we just get fucked up and play R. Kelly. This is a real R&B song and I [said 'I] have to call the king of R&B and I need his blessing.' It was a mutual love.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1716161/lady-gaga-mustache-berlin-artpop-qa.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Puts On Mustache And Unfamiliar Accent For ARTPOP Q&A|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=October 28, 2013|publisher=MTV News.

The [[Official Charts Company]] released a statement explaining that the song would be allowed to chart only after the associated album's pre-order offer ended. The rules of the Official Chart Company "allow one 'instant grat' promotion per album, i.e a single track download given away as an album pre-order incentive. 'Do What U Want' is the second track [following '[[Applause (Lady Gaga song)|Applause]]'] to be delivered to fans who pre-order ''Artpop''".<ref name="no uk chart"/> Thus the song was not eligible to enter the chart until the promotion finished and the album was released.<ref name="no uk chart">{{cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/lorde-and-james-arthur-go-head-to-head-in-battle-for-number-1-on-official-singles-chart-2561/|title=Lorde and James Arthur go head-to-head in battle for Number 1 on Official Singles Chart|last=Myers|first=Justin|date=October 23, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2013|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024090949/http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/lorde-and-james-arthur-go-head-to-head-in-battle-for-number-1-on-official-singles-chart-2561/|archivedate=October 24, 2013}}</ref> According to Alan Jones from ''[[Music Week]]'', in the week following its release the single sold 22,915 copies in the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.musicweek.com/businessanalysis/read/official-charts-analysis-lorde-single-sells-82k-to-hit-no-1/056526|title=Official Charts Analysis: Lorde single sells 82k to hit No.1|last=Jones|first=Alan|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=October 30, 2013|work=[[Music Week]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/fatboy-slim-shows-one-direction-and-the-wanted-hes-still-got-it-2577/|title=Fatboy Slim shows One Direction and The Wanted he's still got it!|last=Lane|first=Daniel|date=October 30, 2013|accessdate=October 30, 2013|publisher=Official Charts Company|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101194521/http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/fatboy-slim-shows-one-direction-and-the-wanted-hes-still-got-it-2577/|archivedate=November 1, 2013}}</ref> After the release of ''Artpop'', "Do What U Want" debuted at number nine on the UK charts with sales of 29,657 copies becoming her 11th top-ten single there.<ref name="uksingles"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.musicweek.com/businessanalysis/read/official-charts-analysis-lady-gaga-hits-no-1-with-65k-sales/056769|title=Official Charts Analysis: Lady Gaga hits No.1 with 65k sales|last=Jones|first=Alan|date=November 18, 2013|accessdate=November 18, 2013|work=Music Week|url-access=subscription |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131118163848/http://www.musicweek.com/businessanalysis/read/official-charts-analysis-lady-gaga-hits-no-1-with-65k-sales/056769|archivedate=November 18, 2013}}</ref> It also entered the [[Scottish Singles Chart]] at the same position.<ref name="scot"/> "Do What U Want" became Gaga's 11th best selling single in the United Kingdom with sales of 248,000 copies by January 2017, and was certified gold by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) for 400,000 copies of streaming equivalent units.

On November 26, 2013, Interscope announced that the video would be released through file sharing service [[BitTorrent]] and [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]], sometime in December 2013. This is BitTorrent's second initiative, following a similar release for singer [[Madonna]] and her ''[[secretprojectrevolution]]'' video. The bundle would consist of the music video, pictures, a separate clip in [[4K resolution]] documenting the making of the release, and interviews with Gaga and director Richardson. Interscope described the bundle as a means of "explor[ing] the link between open expression and open technology; providing an inside look at the creative process, with original film, music, archival content and behind-the-scenes footage direct from artists."<ref name=bundle>{{cite journal|journal=Rolling Stone|accessdate=November 28, 2013|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-documents-do-what-u-want-in-bittorrent-bundle-20131126|title=Lady Gaga Documents 'Do What U Want' in 'BitTorrent Bundle'|date=November 26, 2013|first=Jon|last=Blistein|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128142858/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-documents-do-what-u-want-in-bittorrent-bundle-20131126|archivedate=November 28, 2013}}</ref>

On December 4, 2013, Gaga tweeted that she was intent on making the video "perfect" since it was unlike her previous endeavors, adding that it was "very personal". Two days later, Richardson posted a black-and-white photo from the set of the video, which showed Gaga being held by Kelly; with her legs wrapped around his waist. She wore nothing but a black bikini, while Kelly gestured his [[middle finger]] towards the camera in a leather pant/kilt dress.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1718642/lady-gaga-r-kelly-do-what-u-want-sneak-peak.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Straddles R.

In one of them, Kelly, playing a doctor, reaches under a sheet covering a naked Gaga, causing her to moan. In another scene, Richardson appeared to be photographing Gaga as she writhes on newspapers. According to the TMZ report, the video was cancelled possibly due to weariness and fear of backlash for Kelly's past trial on child pornography, as well as sexual harassment claims by several [[model (person)|models]] who had previously worked with Richardson.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga Music Video Pulled — 'Do What U Want' Controversy|url=https://www.tmz.com/2014/06/19/lady-gaga-music-video-sexual-assault-do-what-u-want/|website=[[TMZ]]|accessdate=June 19, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619171336/http://www.tmz.com/2014/06/19/lady-gaga-music-video-sexual-assault-do-what-u-want/|archivedate=June 19, 2014}}</ref>

The remix starts with Kelly's vocals with a new introduction, followed by Ross rapping on a verse, adding new lines like "Photos of the Bawse just to post 'em on a blog/Get alotta views cause they know we be the top/Jean Basquiats in the hall, she my work of art so I pin her to the wall."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1719498/lady-gaga-rick-ross-do-what-u-want-with-my-body-remix.jhtml|title=Rick Ross 'Pins Lady Gaga To The Wall' On 'Do What U Want (Remix)'|last=Alexis|first=Nadeska|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=December 22, 2013|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222022926/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1719498/lady-gaga-rick-ross-do-what-u-want-with-my-body-remix.jhtml|archivedate=December 22, 2013}}</ref> During Gaga's vocals, the "groove" of the song is updated which was described by [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]] as "nostalgic, banging, sex-freaky and new all at the same time. It's a 2013 ode to another era of synth R&B." Molly Wardlow from the channel was however dismissive of Ross' verse, calling it unnecessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fuse.tv/2013/12/lady-gaga-do-what-u-want-remix-rick-ross|title=Rick Ross Hops on Incredible Remix of Lady Gaga's "Do What U Want"|last=Wardlow|first=Molly|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=December 22, 2013|publisher=Fuse|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110422/http://www.fuse.tv/2013/12/lady-gaga-do-what-u-want-remix-rick-ross|archivedate=December 24, 2013}}</ref> ''Spin'' magazine's Chris Martin noted that Ross' contribution to "Do What U Want" sounded "awkward" and found similarity with [[Jay-Z]]'s rap verse in singer Beyoncé's song, "[[Drunk in Love]]".<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/12/rick-ross-lady-gaga-r-kelly-do-what-u-want-remix/|title=Rick Ross Enters Sexless Threesome With Lady Gaga and R.

==Removal==
Gaga initially defended her collaboration with Kelly, saying that they both have had  "sometimes [...] very untrue things written about" them.<ref name=“bbckelly”>{{cite web|last=Savage|first=Mark|title=Lady Gaga breaks her silence on R Kelly|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46808599|publisher=BBC|date=January 10, 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200418153948/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46808599|archivedate=April 18, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>
However, on January 10, 2019, Gaga spoke out after the release of the [[Lifetime (TV Network)|Lifetime]] series, ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]'', which documented the sexual abuse allegations against Kelly. The singer confessed her regret about working with Kelly, explaining that her thinking was "explicitly twisted" and that she had "poor judgement" at that time. Gaga vowed to support women who had been through abuse and by the next day had the track removed from iTunes and all streaming services.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/10/lady-gaga-apologises-working-r-kelly-promises-withdraw-song/|title=Lady Gaga apologises for working with R.
