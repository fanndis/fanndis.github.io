{{nihongo foot|'''''Pac-Man'''''|パックマン|Pakkuman|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[maze video game|maze]] arcade game developed and released by [[Namco]] in 1980. The original Japanese title of '''''Puck Man''''' was changed to ''Pac-Man'' for international releases as a preventative measure against defacement of the arcade machines by changing the P to an [[fuck|F]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://moneyweek.com/392564/22-may-1980-pac-man-hits-the-arcades/ |title=22 May 1980: Pac-Man hits the arcades |publisher=moneyweek.com |date=May 22, 2015 |accessdate=June 24, 2019}}</ref> Outside Japan, the game was published by [[Midway Games]] as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America. The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|ghosts]]. Eating large flashing dots called "energizers" causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.

The development of the game began in early 1979, directed by [[Toru Iwatani]] with a nine-man team. Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, because most video games of the time had themes of war or sports. Although the inspiration for the Pac-Man character was, reportedly, the image of a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has said he also rounded out the Japanese character for mouth, '''kuchi''' ({{lang-ja|[[wiktionary:口|口]]}}). The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title of ''Puckman'' was derived from the titular character's hockey-puck shape.

''Pac-Man'' was a widespread critical and commercial success, and it has an enduring commercial and cultural legacy. The game is considered important and influential, and it is commonly listed as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. The success of the game led to several [[List of Pac-Man video games|sequels]], merchandise, and two television series, as well as a [[Pac-Man Fever (song)|hit single]] by [[Buckner & Garcia|Buckner and Garcia]]. The ''Pac-Man'' video game franchise remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling game series of all time, generating more than $14&nbsp;billion in revenue ({{as of|2016|lc=yes}}) and $43&nbsp;million in sales combined. The character of Pac-Man is the mascot and flagship icon of [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] and has the highest brand awareness of any video game character in North America.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Pac-man.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot. The four ghosts are in the center of the screen with Pac-Man situated underneath them. To the bottom is the player's life count and the level icon (represented in this case by a cherry), to the top is the player's score.]]
''Pac-Man'' is a [[maze video game|maze chase]] video game; the player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|the eponymous character]] through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts — Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) — that pursue him. When all of the dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts have their own unique, distinct [[artificial intelligence]] (A.I.), or "personalities"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man, Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015061417/https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |archive-date=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref name="CNBC.com">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>

Placed at the four corners of the maze are large flashing "energizers", or "power pellets". Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze, where the ghosts are "regenerated" and resume their normal activity. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. After a certain amount of time, blue-colored ghosts will flash white before turning back into their normal, lethal form. Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item, usually in the form of a fruit, to appear underneath the center box, which can be eaten for bonus points.

The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses; the ghosts become faster and the energizers' effect decreases in duration, to the point where the ghosts will no longer turn blue and edible. To the sides of the maze are two "warp tunnels", which allow Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels. Levels are indicated by the fruit icon at the bottom of the screen. In-between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac-Man and Blinky in humorous, comical situations. The game becomes unplayable at the 256th level due to an [[integer overflow]] that affects the game's memory.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cult Fiction |last1=Dwyer |first1=James |last2=Dwyer |first2=Brendan |publisher=Paused Books |year=2014 |isbn=9780992988401 |page=14}}</ref>

"Maze chase" games exploded on home computers after the release of ''Pac-Man''. Some of them appeared before official ports and garnered more attention from consumers, and sometimes lawyers, as a result. These include ''[[Taxman (video game)|Taxman]]'' (1981) and ''[[Snack Attack]]'' (1982) for the Apple II, ''[[Jawbreaker (video game)|Jawbreaker]]'' (1981) for the Atari 8-bit family, ''[[Scarfman]]'' (1981) for the TRS-80, and ''[[K.C. Munchkin!]]'' (1981) for the Odyssey². Namco themselves produced several other maze chase games, including ''[[Rally-X]]'' (1980), ''[[Dig Dug]]'' (1982), ''[[Exvania]]'' (1992), and ''[[Tinkle Pit]]'' (1994).

''Pac-Man'' also inspired 3D variants of the concept, such as ''[[Monster Maze]] (1982)'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Monster Maze |url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-monster-maze_3491.html}}</ref> ''[[Spectre (Apple II video game)|Spectre]]'' (1982), and early [[first-person shooter]]s such as ''[[MIDI Maze]]'' (1987; which also had similar character designs).<ref name="gamesradarimportant" />{{rp|5}}<ref>{{cite web |title=25 years of Pac-Man |publisher=MeriStation |date=July 4, 2005 |url=http://www.meristation.com/v3/des_articulo.php?pic=DC&id=cw42b7458f0dfc7&idj=&idp=&tipo=art&c=1&pos=7 |accessdate=May 6, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929150234/http://www.meristation.com/v3/des_articulo.php?pic=DC&id=cw42b7458f0dfc7&idj=&idp=&tipo=art&c=1&pos=7 |archive-date=September 29, 2011}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meristation.com%2Fv3%2Fdes_articulo.php%3Fpic%3DDC%26id%3Dcw42b7458f0dfc7%26idj%3D%26idp%3D%26tipo%3Dart%26c%3D1%26pos%3D7&sl=es&tl=en&hl=&ie=UTF-8 Translation])</ref> [[John Romero]] credited ''Pac-Man'' as the game that had the biggest influence on his career;<ref>{{cite web |last=Bailey |first=Kat |title=These games inspired Cliff Bleszinski, John Romero, Will Wright, and Sid Meier |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/03/09/these-games-inspired-cliff-bleszinski-john-romero-will-wright/ |publisher=Joystiq |accessdate=April 2, 2012 |date=March 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202004044/http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/09/these-games-inspired-cliff-bleszinski-john-romero-will-wright/ |archive-date=February 2, 2017 }}</ref> ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' includes a ''Pac-Man'' level from a first-person perspective.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Book of Games: The Ultimate Reference on PC & Video Games |publisher=Book of Games |year=2006 |isbn=82-997378-0-X |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cllMaThkYlIC&pg=PA24 |accessdate=May 6, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122175354/https://books.google.com/books?id=cllMaThkYlIC&pg=PA24 |archive-date=November 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Game developer |volume=2 & 5 |publisher=[[Miller Freeman]] |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zg9AQAAIAAJ |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |page=62 |quote=If you made it to the secret Pac-Man level in Castle Wolfenstein, you know what I mean (Pac-Man never would have made it as a three-dimensional game).

[[Guinness World Records]] has awarded the ''Pac-Man'' series eight records in ''Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008'', including "Most Successful Coin-Operated Game". On June 3, 2010, at the NLGD Festival of Games, the game's creator Toru Iwatani officially received the certificate from Guinness World Records for ''Pac-Man'' having had the most "coin-operated arcade machines" installed worldwide: 293,822. The record was set and recognized in 2005 and mentioned in the ''Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008'', but finally actually awarded in 2010.<ref name="nlgd" />

The Pac-Man character and game series became an icon of video game culture during the 1980s. A wide variety of ''Pac-Man'' merchandise has been marketed with the character's image, including [[t-shirt]]s, toys, hand-held video game imitations, pasta, and cereal.

The game has inspired various real-life recreations, involving real people or robots. One event called [[Pac-Manhattan]] set a Guinness World Record for "Largest ''Pac-Man'' Game" in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pacmanhattan.com/about.php |title=About Pac-Manhattan |publisher=Pac-Manhattan |year=2004 |accessdate=July 3, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508155903/http://pacmanhattan.com/about.php |archive-date=May 8, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://pacman.elstonj.com |title=Roomba Pac-Man Web Site |accessdate=October 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109104243/http://pacman.elstonj.com/ |archive-date=November 9, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dominic |last=Lau |url=http://www.cs.sfu.ca/news/index.cgi/articles/2007-11-15-1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530004141/http://www.cs.sfu.ca/news/index.cgi/articles/2007-11-15-1.html |archive-date=May 30, 2009 |title=Pacman in Vancouver |publisher=SFU Computing Science |accessdate=July 3, 2009}}</ref> The business term "[[Pac-Man defense]]" in [[mergers and acquisitions]] refers to a [[Takeover|hostile takeover]] target that attempts to reverse the situation and instead acquire its attempted acquirer, a reference to ''Pac-Man''{{'}}s energizers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Origins of the 'Pac-Man' Defense |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/23/business/origins-of-the-pac-man-defense.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 20, 2010 |date=January 23, 1988 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214163345/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/23/business/origins-of-the-pac-man-defense.html |archive-date=February 14, 2012}}</ref> The game's popularity has led to "Pac-Man" being adopted as a nickname, such as by boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Brunell |first=Evan |title=Popular Video Game Pac-Man Celebrates 30th Anniversary |url=http://www.nesn.com/2010/05/popular-video-game-pacman-celebrates-30th-anniversary.html |publisher=[[New England Sports Network]] |accessdate=April 11, 2012 |date=May 22, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722004002/http://www.nesn.com/2010/05/popular-video-game-pacman-celebrates-30th-anniversary.html |archive-date=July 22, 2010}}</ref> and the [[American football]] player [[Adam Jones (American football)|Adam Jones]].

===Perfect scores and other records===
A perfect score on the original ''Pac-Man'' arcade game is 3,333,360 points, achieved when the player obtains the maximum score on the first 255 levels by eating every dot, energizer, fruit and blue ghost without losing a man, then uses all six men to obtain the maximum possible number of points on level 256.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oafe.net/yo/pacplu.php |title=Pac-Man review at OAFE |publisher=Oafe.net |accessdate=November 15, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021153000/http://www.oafe.net/yo/pacplu.php |archive-date=October 21, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Mitchell">{{cite web |last=Ramsey |first=David |title=The Perfect Man |url=http://www.oxfordamericanmag.com/content.cfm?ArticleID=58&Entry=Home |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229043301/http://www.oxfordamericanmag.com/content.cfm?ArticleID=58&Entry=Home |archive-date=February 29, 2008 |publisher=Oxford American |accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref>

In December 1982, eight-year-old boy Jeffrey R.

==Remakes and sequels==
{{see also|List of Pac-Man video games}}
''Pac-Man'' inspired a long series of sequels, remakes, and re-imaginings, and is one of the longest-running video game franchises in history. The first of these was ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'', developed by the American-based [[General Computer Corporation]] and published by Midway in 1982. The character's gender was changed to female in response to ''Pac-Man''{{'}}s popularity with women, with new mazes, moving bonus items, and faster gameplay being implemented to increase its appeal. ''Ms. Pac-Man'' is one of the best-selling arcade games in North America, and it is often seen as being superior to its predecessor. Legal concerns raised over who owned the game caused ''Ms. Pac-Man'' to become owned by Namco, who assisted in production of the game. ''Ms. Pac-Man'' inspired its own line of remakes, including ''[[Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness]]'' (2000), and ''[[Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the Golden Maze]]'', and is also included in many Namco and ''Pac-Man'' collections for consoles.

Namco's own follow-up to the original was ''[[Super Pac-Man]]'', released in 1982. This was followed by the Japan-exclusive ''[[Pac & Pal]]'' in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parish |first1=Jeremy |title=Remembering Pac & Pal, Pac-Man's Strangest Arcade Adventure |url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/weekly-classic-pacpal |website=[[USgamer]] |accessdate=23 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123175821/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/weekly-classic-pacpal |archive-date=23 January 2018 |date=23 July 2013}}</ref> Midway produced many other ''Pac-Man'' sequels during the early 1980s, including ''[[Pac-Man Plus]]'' (1982), ''[[Jr. Pac-Man]]'' (1983), ''[[Baby Pac-Man]]'' (1983), and ''[[Professor Pac-Man]]'' (1984). Other games include the isometric ''[[Pac-Mania]]'' (1987), the side-scrollers ''[[Pac-Land]]'' (1984), ''[[Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures|Hello!
