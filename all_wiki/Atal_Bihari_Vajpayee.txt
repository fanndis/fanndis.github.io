'''Atal Bihari Vajpayee''' ({{IPA-hns|əʈəl bɪɦaːɾiː ʋaːdʒpai}}; 25&nbsp;December 1924&nbsp;– 16&nbsp;August 2018) was an Indian statesman who served three terms as the [[Prime Minister of India]], first for a term of 13&nbsp;days in 1996, then for a period of 13&nbsp;months from 1998 to 1999, followed by a full term from 1999 to 2004. A member of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), he was the first Indian prime minister not of the [[Indian National Congress]] to serve a full term in office. He was also noted as a poet and a writer.

He was a member of the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]] for over five decades, having been elected ten times to the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house, and twice to the [[Rajya Sabha]], the upper house. He served as the [[Member of parliament, Lok Sabha|Member of Parliament]] for [[Lucknow]], retiring from active politics in 2009 due to health concerns. He was among the founding members of the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]] (BJS), of which he was president from 1968 to 1972. The BJS merged with several other parties to form the [[Janata Party]], which won the [[1977 Indian general election|1977 general election]]. In March 1977, Vajpayee became the [[Minister of External Affairs (India)|Minister of External Affairs]] in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Morarji Desai]]. He resigned in 1979, and the Janata alliance collapsed soon after. Former members of the BJS formed the BJP in 1980, with Vajpayee its first president.

During his tenure as prime minister, India carried out the [[Pokhran-II]] nuclear tests in 1998. Vajpayee sought to improve diplomatic relations with Pakistan, [[Lahore Declaration|travelling to Lahore]] by bus to meet with Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]]. After the [[Kargil War|1999 Kargil War]] with Pakistan, he sought to restore relations through engagement with President [[Pervez Musharraf]], inviting him to India for a summit at [[Agra]].

The administration of [[Narendra Modi]] declared in 2014 that Vajpayee's birthday, 25&nbsp;December, would be marked as [[Good Governance Day]]. In 2015, he was conferred India's highest civilian honour, the [[Bharat Ratna]], by the [[President of India]], [[Pranab Mukherjee]]. He died on 16&nbsp;August 2018 of age-related illness.

== Early life and education ==
Vajpayee was born into a [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin]] family on 25&nbsp;December 1924 in [[Gwalior]], [[Madhya Pradesh]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.in/political-leaders/atal-bihari-vajpayee.html|title=Atal Bihari Vajpayee Biography&nbsp;– About family, political life, awards won, history|website=elections.in|access-date=24 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724122802/http://www.elections.in/political-leaders/atal-bihari-vajpayee.html|archive-date=24 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> His mother and father were Krishna Devi and Krishna Bihari Vajpayee.{{sfn|N P|2018|p=}} His father was a school teacher in their home town.<ref name="nytobit">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/obituaries/atal-bihari-vajpayee-dead.html|title=Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Former Prime Minister of India, Dies at 93|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|access-date=16 August 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816160346/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/obituaries/atal-bihari-vajpayee-dead.html|archive-date=16 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> His grandfather, Shyam Lal Vajpayee, had migrated to [[Morena]] near Gwalior from his ancestral village of [[Bateshwar, Uttar Pradesh|Bateshwar]] in the [[Agra district]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]].{{sfn|N P|2018|p=}}

Vajpayee did his schooling at the Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Gwalior. In 1934, he was admitted to the Anglo-Vernacular Middle (AVM) School in [[Badnagar|Barnagar]], [[Ujjain district]], after his father joined as headmaster. He subsequently attended Gwalior's Victoria College (now [[Maharani Laxmi Bai Govt. College of Excellence]]) to study for a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[Hindi]], English and [[Sanskrit]]. He completed his post-graduation with an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Political Science from [[DAV College, Kanpur]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://samvada.org/2012/news/the-sangh-rss-is-my-soul-writes-atal-behari-vajpayee/|title=The Sangh (RSS) is my Soul; writes Atal Bihari Vajpayee|date=19 January 2012|work=Vishwa Samvada Kendra|access-date=24 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818131858/http://samvada.org/2012/news/the-sangh-rss-is-my-soul-writes-atal-behari-vajpayee/|archive-date=18 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Independence Movement==

His activism started in Gwalior with Arya Kumar Sabha, the youth wing of the [[Arya Samaj]] movement, of which he became the general secretary in 1944. He also joined the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) in 1939 as a ''swayamsevak'', or volunteer. Influenced by [[Babasaheb Apte]], he attended the Officers Training Camp of the RSS during 1940 to 1944, becoming a ''pracharak'' (RSS terminology for a full-time worker) in 1947. He gave up studying law due to the [[Partition of India|partition]] riots. He was sent to Uttar Pradesh as a ''vistarak'' (a probationary ''pracharak'') and soon began working for the newspapers of [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]]: ''Rashtradharma'' (a Hindi monthly), ''[[Panchjanya (magazine)|Panchjanya]]'' (a Hindi weekly), and the dailies ''Swadesh'' and ''Veer Arjun''.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/outliers-prime-minister-narendra-modi-rss-pracharak-indira-gandhi-p-v-narashima-rao-atal-bihari-vajpayee/1/355731.html|title=The outliers who won the PMs post|access-date=24 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112204756/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/outliers-prime-minister-narendra-modi-rss-pracharak-indira-gandhi-p-v-narashima-rao-atal-bihari-vajpayee/1/355731.html|archive-date=12 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=131–132}}

By 1942, at the age of 16 years, Vajpayee became an active member of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS). Although the RSS had chosen not to participate in the [[Quit India Movement]], in August 1942, Vajpayee and his elder brother Prem were arrested for 24 days during the [[Quit India Movement]]. He was released after giving a written statement that while he was a part of the crowd, he did not participate in the militant events in Bateshwar on 27 August 1942. Throughout his life, including after he became Prime Minister, Vajpayee has labelled the allegation a false rumour.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chatterjee|first1=Manini|first2=V.

== Early political career (1947–1975) ==

In 1951, Vajpayee was seconded by the RSS, along with [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]], to work for the newly formed [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], a Hindu right-wing political party associated with the RSS. He was appointed as a national secretary of the party in charge of the Northern region, based in Delhi. He soon became a follower and aide of party leader [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]]. In the [[1957 Indian general election]], Vajpayee contested elections to the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]]. He lost to [[Mahendra Pratap|Raja Mahendra Pratap]] in [[Mathura]], but was elected from [[Balrampur]]. In the Lok Sabha his oratorial skills so impressed Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] that he predicted that Vajpayee would someday become the Prime Minister of India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/LS_1957/Vol_I_57_LS.pdf|title=Election Commission of India|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008104728/http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/LS_1957/Vol_I_57_LS.pdf|archive-date=8 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/explained-battleground-amu-a-raja-and-his-legacy/|title=Explained: Battleground AMU; A Raja and his Legacy|date=29 November 2014|work=The Indian Express|access-date=24 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603074728/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/explained-battleground-amu-a-raja-and-his-legacy/|archive-date=3 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/goodgov/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=113866|title=Print Release|website=pib.nic.in|access-date=24 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130183530/http://www.pib.nic.in/goodgov/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=113866|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Terms as Prime Minister (1996–2004) ==
=== First term: May 1996 ===

During a BJP conference in Mumbai in November 1995, BJP President Advani declared that Vajpayee would be the party's Prime Ministerial candidate in the forthcoming elections. Vajpayee himself was reported to be unhappy with the announcement, responding by saying that the party needed to win the election first.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-will-the-rath-yatra-bring-lk-advani-back-in-rss-good-books-1597360|title=Will the 'rath yatra' bring LK Advani back in RSS good books?|date=11 October 2011|work=dna|access-date=24 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921001841/http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-will-the-rath-yatra-bring-lk-advani-back-in-rss-good-books-1597360|archive-date=21 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The BJP became the single largest party in Parliament in the [[1996 Indian general election|1996 general election]], helped by religious polarisation across the country as a result of the demolition of the Babri Masjid.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=633}}{{sfn|M.

{{See also|Second Vajpayee ministry}}
After the fall of the two [[Third Front (India)|United Front]] governments between 1996 and 1998, the Lok Sabha was dissolved and fresh elections were held. The [[1998 Indian general election|1998 general elections]] again put the BJP ahead of others. A number of political parties joined the BJP to form the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA), and Vajpayee was sworn in as the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/india_elections/61761.stm|title=Atal Bihari Vajpayee: India's new prime minister|publisher=BBC|access-date=24 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205150717/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/india_elections/61761.stm|archive-date=5 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The coalition was an uneasy one,<ref name="BBC1" /> as apart from the [[Shiv Sena]], none of the other parties espoused the BJP's Hindu-nationalist ideology.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=662}} Vajpayee has been credited for managing this coalition successfully, while facing ideological pressure from the hardline wing of the party and from the RSS.<ref name="Nag" /> Vajpayee's government lasted 13 months until mid-1999 when the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) under [[J.

==== Nuclear tests ====
{{See also|Pokhran-II}}
In May 1998, India conducted [[Pokhran-II|five underground nuclear tests]] in the [[Pokhran]] desert in [[Rajasthan]], 24 years after its first nuclear test ([[Smiling Buddha]]) in 1974. Two weeks later, Pakistan responded with its own nuclear tests making it the newest nation with declared nuclear capability.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=673–675}} While some nations, such as France, endorsed India's right to defensive nuclear power,{{sfn|Ajai K. Rai|2009|p=162}} others including the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain and the [[European Union]] imposed sanctions on information, resources and technology to India. In spite of intense international criticism and steady decline in foreign investment and trade, the nuclear tests were popular domestically. In effect, the international sanctions imposed failed to sway India from weaponising its nuclear capability. US sanctions against India and Pakistan were eventually lifted after just six months.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Morrow|first1=Daniel|last2=Carriere|first2=Michael|date=Fall 1999|title=The economic impacts of the 1998 sanctions on India and Pakistan|url=https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/npr/morrow64.pdf|page=10|access-date=24 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808155139/http://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/npr/morrow64.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Lahore summit ====
In late 1998 and early 1999, Vajpayee began a push for a full-scale diplomatic peace process with Pakistan. With the historic inauguration of the Delhi-Lahore bus service in February 1999, Vajpayee initiated a new peace process aimed towards permanently resolving the Kashmir dispute and other conflicts with Pakistan. The resultant [[Lahore Declaration]] espoused a commitment to dialogue, expanded trade relations and mutual friendship and envisaged a goal of denuclearised South Asia. This eased the tension created by the 1998 nuclear tests, not only within the two nations but also in South Asia and the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9902/21/india.pakistan/index.html|title=CNN – Leaders of Pakistan, India pledge to work toward peace – February 21, 1999|publisher=CNN|access-date=17 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131041558/http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9902/21/india.pakistan/index.html|archive-date=31 January 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Maggsi, Amjad Abbas.

==== AIADMK's withdrawal from coalition ====
The AIADMK had continually threatened to withdraw from the coalition and national leaders repeatedly flew down from Delhi to Chennai to pacify the AIADMK general secretary [[J. Jayalalithaa]]. However, in May 1999, the AIADMK did pull the plug on the NDA, and the Vajpayee administration was reduced to a caretaker status pending [[1999 Indian general election|fresh elections scheduled for October 1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiasociety.org/publications/indian_elections.13.a.html |title=The Thirteenth Election of India's Lok Sabha |last=Oldenburg |first=Philip |date=September 1999 |publisher=The Asia Society |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604152951/http://www.asiasociety.org/publications/indian_elections.13.a.html |archive-date=4 June 2008 }}</ref>

==== Kargil War ====
{{Further|Kargil War}}

In May 1999 some Kashmiri shepherds discovered the presence of militants and non-uniformed Pakistani soldiers (many with official identifications and [[Pakistan Army]]'s custom weaponry) in the Kashmir Valley, where they had taken control of border hilltops and unmanned border posts. The incursion was centred around the town of [[Kargil]], but also included the [[Batalik]] and [[Akhnoor]] sectors and artillery exchanges at the [[Siachen Glacier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/sjir/3.1.06_kapur-narang.html|title=SJIR: The Fate of Kashmir : International Law or Lawlessness?|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=17 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012061736/https://web.stanford.edu/group/sjir/3.1.06_kapur-narang.html|archive-date=12 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=675–678}}

The NDA was widely expected to retain power after the [[2004 Indian general election|2004 general election]].

== Post-premiership ==
In December 2005, Vajpayee announced his retirement from active politics, declaring that he would not contest in the next general election. In a famous statement at the BJP's silver jubilee rally at Mumbai's [[Shivaji Park]], Vajpayee announced that "Henceforth, [[Lal Krishna Advani]] and [[Pramod Mahajan]] will be the [[Rama|Ram]]-[[Lakshmana|Lakshman]] [the two godly brothers much revered and worshipped by Hindus] of the BJP."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4567802.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} World {{!}} South Asia {{!}} Vajpayee to retire from politics|publisher=BBC|access-date=25 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123203026/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4567802.stm|archive-date=23 November 2006|url-status=live|date=29 December 2005}}</ref>

Vajpayee was referred to as the ''[[Bhishma]] Pitamah'' of Indian politics by former Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] during a speech in the [[Rajya Sabha]], a reference to the character in the Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]] who was held in respect by two warring sides.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ldquoBhishma-Pitamahrdquo-should-rise-above-party-politics-PM/article15179175.ece|title="Bhishma Pitamah" should rise above party politics: PM|work=The Hindu|access-date=25 July 2017}}</ref>

Vajpayee was hospitalised at [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi]] (AIIMS) for a chest infection and fever on 6 February 2009.

He said the American people stand with the people of India "as we mourn Prime Minister Vajpayee's passing".<ref>{{cite web |title=Statement by Secretary Pompeo on Passing of Former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee |url=https://in.usembassy.gov/statement-by-secretary-of-state-michael-r-pompeo-on-passing-of-former-indian-prime-minister-atal-bihari-vajpayee/ |website=U.S. Embassy & Consulates in India |publisher=in.usembassy.gov |access-date=19 August 2018 |date=17 August 2018}}</ref>
