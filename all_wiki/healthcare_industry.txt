The '''healthcare industry''' (also called the '''medical industry''' or '''health economy''') is an aggregation and integration of sectors within the [[economic system]] that provides goods and services to treat patients with [[Curative care|curative]], [[Preventive medicine|preventive]], [[physical therapy|rehabilitative]], and [[palliative care]]. It includes the generation and commercialization of goods and services lending themselves to maintaining and re-establishing health. The modern healthcare industry includes three essential branches which are services, products, and finance and may be divided into many sectors and categories and depends on the interdisciplinary teams of trained professionals and paraprofessionals to meet health needs of individuals and populations.<ref name="PrincetonDef">[https://cns.utexas.edu/health-professions HEALTH PROFESSIONS] [http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=health%20profession]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=USDL>{{cite web |url=http://www.doleta.gov/BRG/Indprof/Health.cfm |title=Health Care Initiatives, Employment & Training Administration (ETA) - U.S. Department of Labor |publisher=Doleta.gov |accessdate=2015-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129005204/http://www.doleta.gov/BRG/Indprof/Health.cfm |archive-date=2012-01-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The healthcare industry is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing [[industry (economics)|industries]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.kff.org/insurance/snapshot/chcm050206oth2.cfm |title=Snapshots: Comparing Projected Growth in Health Care Expenditures and the Economy &#124; The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation |publisher=Kff.org |date=2006-04-17 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}</ref> Consuming over 10 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of most [[developed nations]], health care can form an enormous part of a country's economy.

==Backgrounds==
For the purpose of finance and management, the healthcare industry is typically divided into several areas. As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] (ISIC) categorizes the healthcare industry as generally consisting of:
# Hospital activities;
# Medical and [[dentistry|dental]] practice activities;
# "Other [[health|human health]] activities".

This third class involves activities of, or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, scientific or diagnostic laboratories, pathology clinics, residential health facilities, or other [[allied health profession]]s, e.g. in the field of optometry, hydrotherapy, medical massage, yoga therapy, music therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, chiropody, homeopathy, chiropractic, acupuncture, etc.<ref>United Nations. [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=2 ''International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Rev.3.''] New York.</ref>

The [[Global Industry Classification Standard]] and the [[Industry Classification Benchmark]] further distinguish the industry as two main groups:
# healthcare equipment and services; and
# [[pharmaceuticals]], [[biotechnology]] and related [[life sciences]].
The healthcare equipment and services group consists of companies and entities that provide medical equipment, medical supplies, and healthcare services, such as hospitals, home healthcare providers, and [[nursing home]]s. The latter listed industry group includes companies that produce biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and miscellaneous scientific services.<ref name="YahooFin">{{cite web |url=http://biz.yahoo.com/p/5conameu.html| title= Yahoo Industry Browser – Healthcare Sector – Industry List|publisher=Biz.yahoo.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref>

Other approaches to defining the scope of the healthcare industry tend to adopt a broader definition, also including other key actions related to health, such as education and training of health professionals, regulation and management of health services delivery, provision of [[traditional medicine|traditional]] and complementary medicines, and administration of [[health insurance]].<ref>Hernandez P et al., "Measuring expenditure on the health workforce: concepts, data sources and methods", in: ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health'', Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009.</ref>

==Providers and professionals==
{{See also|Healthcare provider|Health workforce}}
A [[healthcare provider]] is an institution (such as a hospital or clinic) or person (such as a physician, nurse, [[allied health profession]]al or [[community health worker]]) that provides preventive, curative, [[health promotion|promotional]], rehabilitative or palliative care services in a systematic way to individuals, families or communities.

The [[World Health Organization]] estimates there are 9.2 million physicians, 19.4 million nurses and midwives, 1.9 million dentists and other dentistry personnel, 2.6 million pharmacists and other pharmaceutical personnel, and over 1.3 million community health workers worldwide,<ref>World Health Organization. [https://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2011/en/index.html ''World Health Statistics 2011''] – Table 6: Health workforce, infrastructure and essential medicines. Geneva, 2011. Accessed 21 July 2011.</ref> making the health care industry one of the largest segments of the workforce.

The medical industry is also supported by many professions that do not directly provide health care itself, but are part of the management and support of the [[health care system]]. The incomes of [[Health administration|managers and administrators]], [[underwriters]] and [[medical malpractice]] attorneys, marketers, investors and shareholders of for-profit services, all are attributable to [[health care costs]].<ref name="Gold">{{cite journal| author=Evans RG| title=Going for the gold: the redistributive agenda behind market-based health care reform. | journal=J Health Polit Policy Law| year= 1997 | volume= 22 | issue= 2 | pages= 427–65 | pmid=9159711 | doi=10.1215/03616878-22-2-427 | url= http://www.pnhp.org/PDF_files/Going%20for%20the%20Gold%20-%20Redistributive%20Agenda%20behind%20Market-Based%20Health%20Care%20Reform.pdf| citeseerx=10.1.1.573.7172 }}</ref>

In 2017, healthcare costs paid to hospitals, physicians, [[nursing home]]s, [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] laboratories, [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]], [[medical device]] manufacturers and other components of the healthcare system, consumed 17.9 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States, the largest of any country in the world. It is expected that the health share of the [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) will continue its upward trend, reaching 19.9 percent of GDP by 2025.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Keehan|first1=Sean P.|last2=Stone|first2=Devin A.|last3=Poisal|first3=John A.|last4=Cuckler|first4=Gigi A.|last5=Sisko|first5=Andrea M.|last6=Smith|first6=Sheila D.|last7=Madison|first7=Andrew J.|last8=Wolfe|first8=Christian J.|last9=Lizonitz|first9=Joseph M.|date=March 2017|title=National Health Expenditure Projections, 2016–25: Price Increases, Aging Push Sector To 20 Percent Of Economy|journal=Health Affairs|volume=36|issue=3|pages=553–563|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2016.1627|pmid=28202501|s2cid=4927588|issn=0278-2715|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/931e88e89f938d89cd80a75228cf4055dbbbd67c}}</ref> In 2001, for the [[OECD]] countries the average was 8.4 percent<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/10/20/2789777.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320210602/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/10/20/2789777.pdf |date=March 20, 2007 }}</ref> with the [[United States]] (13.9%), [[Switzerland]] (10.9%), and [[Germany]] (10.7%) being the top three. US health care expenditures totaled US$2.2 trillion in 2006.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> According to Health Affairs, US$7,498 be spent on every woman, man and child in the United States in 2007, 20 percent of all spending. Costs are projected to increase to $12,782 by 2016.<ref>"Average 2016 health-care bill: $12,782" by Ricardo Alonso-Zalvidar ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' February 21, 2007</ref>

The government does not ensure all-inclusive health care to every one of its natives, yet certain freely supported health care programs help to accommodate a portion of the elderly, crippled, and poor people and elected law guarantees community to crisis benefits paying little respect to capacity to pay. Those without health protection scope are relied upon to pay secretly for therapeutic administrations. Health protection is costly and hospital expenses are overwhelmingly the most well-known explanation behind individual liquidation in the United States.

==Delivery of services==
{{see also|Gatekeeper physicians}}
The delivery of healthcare services—from [[primary care]] to [[secondary care|secondary]] and [[tertiary care|tertiary]] levels of care—is the most visible part of any healthcare system, both to users and the general public.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/healthsystems/topics/delivery/en/index.html |title=WHO &#124; Health systems service delivery |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}</ref>  There are many ways of providing healthcare in the modern world. The place of delivery may be in the home, the community, the workplace, or in health facilities. The most common way is face-to-face delivery, where care provider and patient see each other in person. This is what occurs in general medicine in most countries. However, with modern telecommunications technology, [[In absentia health care|''in absentia'' health care]] or Tele-Health is becoming more common. This could be when practitioner and patient communicate over the [[telephone|phone]], [[video conferencing]], the internet, email, [[text messages]], or any other form of non-face-to-face communication. Practices like these are especial applicable to rural regions in developed nations. These services are typically implemented on a clinic-by-clinic basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/telehealth|title=Telehealth Use in Rural Healthcare Introduction - Rural Health Information Hub|website=www.ruralhealthinfo.org|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>

Improving access, coverage and quality of health services depends on the ways services are organized and managed, and on the incentives influencing providers and users. In market-based [[health care system]]s, for example such as that in the United States, such services are usually paid for by the patient or through the patient's [[health insurance]] company. Other mechanisms include government-financed systems (such as the [[National Health Service]] in the United Kingdom). In many poorer countries, [[development aid]], as well as funding through charities or volunteers, help support the delivery and financing of health care services among large segments of the population.<ref>[http://www.eldis.org/go/topics/resource-guides/health-systems/health-service-delivery]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726022136/http://www.eldis.org/go/topics/resource-guides/health-systems/health-service-delivery |date=July 26, 2011 }}</ref>

The structure of healthcare charges can also vary dramatically among countries. For instance, Chinese hospital charges tend toward 50% for drugs, another major percentage for equipment, and a small percentage for healthcare professional fees.<ref name=GENENG15June2007>

}}</ref> China has implemented a long-term transformation of its healthcare industry, beginning in the 1980s.  Over the first twenty-five years of this transformation, government contributions to healthcare expenditures have dropped from 36% to 15%, with the burden of managing this decrease falling largely on patients.  Also over this period, a small proportion of state-owned hospitals have been privatized.  As an incentive to privatization, foreign investment in hospitals—up to 70% ownership has been encouraged.<ref name=GENENG15June2007/>

== Systems ==
{{Main|Health system}}

Healthcare systems dictate the means by which people and institutions pay for and receive health services. Models vary based on the country, with the responsibility of payment ranging from public ([[social insurance]]) and private [[Health insurance|health insurers]] to the [[Consumer-driven healthcare|consumer-driven]] by patients themselves. These systems finance and organize the services delivered by providers. A [[Two-tier healthcare|two-tier system]] of public and private is common.

The [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] define four commonly utilized systems of payment:

=== Beveridge model ===
Named after British economist and social reformer [[William Beveridge]], the Beveridge model sees healthcare financed and provided by a central government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/welfare.htm|title=The National Archives {{!}} Exhibitions {{!}} Citizenship {{!}} Brave new world|website=www.nationalarchives.gov.uk|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref> The system was initially proposed in his 1942 report, ''Social Insurance and Allied Services—''known as the [[Beveridge Report]]. The system is the guiding basis of the modern British healthcare model enacted post-[[World War II]]. It has been utilized in numerous countries, including The United Kingdom, Cuba, and New Zealand.<ref name=":03">{{Cite web|url=https://pphr.princeton.edu/2017/12/02/unhealthy-health-care-a-cursory-overview-of-major-health-care-systems/|title=Health Care Reform: Learning From Other Major Health Care Systems {{!}} Princeton Public Health Review|website=pphr.princeton.edu|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref>

The system sees all healthcare services— which are provided and financed solely by the government. This single payer system is financed through national taxation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Insurance and Allied Services|url=https://archive.org/details/socialinsurancea00sirw|url-access=registration|last=Beveridge|first=William|year=1942}}</ref> Typically, the government owns and runs the clinics and hospitals, meaning that doctors are employees of the government. However, depending on the specific system, public providers can be accompanied by private doctors who collect fees from the government.<ref name=":03"/> The underlying principal of this system is that healthcare is a fundamental human right. Thus, the government provides universal coverage to all citizens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bevan|first1=Gwyn|last2=Helderman|first2=Jan-Kees|last3=Wilsford|first3=David|date=July 2010|title=Changing choices in health care: implications for equity, efficiency and cost|journal=Health Economics, Policy and Law|volume=5|issue=3|pages=251–267|doi=10.1017/S1744133110000022|issn=1744-134X|pmid=20478104|doi-access=free}}</ref> Generally, the Beveridge model yields a low cost per capita compared to other systems.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worldhealthrepor00worl|url-access=registration|quote=Britain.|title=The World Health Report 2000: Health Systems : Improving Performance|last=Organization|first=World Health|date=2000|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241561983}}</ref>

=== Bismarck model ===
The Bismarck system was first employed in 1883 by Prussian Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Busse|first1=Reinhard|last2=Blümel|first2=Miriam|last3=Knieps|first3=Franz|last4=Bärnighausen|first4=Till|date=2017-08-26|title=Statutory health insurance in Germany: a health system shaped by 135 years of solidarity, self-governance, and competition|journal=Lancet|volume=390|issue=10097|pages=882–897|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31280-1|issn=1474-547X|pmid=28684025|doi-access=free}}</ref> In this system, insurance is mandated by the government and is typically sold on a non-profit basis. In many cases, employers and employees finance insurers through payroll deduction. In a pure Bismarck system, access to insurance is seen as a right solely predicated on labor status. The system attempts to cover all working citizens, meaning patients cannot be excluded from insurance due to pre-existing conditions. While care is privatized, it is closely regulated by the state through fixed procedure pricing. This means that most insurance claims are reimbursed without challenge, creating low administrative burden.<ref name=":1" /> Archetypal implementation of the Bismarck system can be seen in Germany's nationalized healthcare. Similar systems can be found in France, Belgium, and Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sickaroundtheworld/countries/models.html|title=Five Countries - Health Care Systems -- The Four Basic Models {{!}} Sick Around The World {{!}} FRONTLINE {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref>

=== National health insurance model ===
The national insurance model shares and mixes elements from both the Bismarck and Beveridge models. The emergence of the National Health Insurance model is cited as a response to the challenges presented by the traditional Bismarck and Beveridge systems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=van der Zee|first1=Jouke|last2=Kroneman|first2=Madelon|date=2007-02-01|title=Bismarck or Beveridge: A beauty contest between dinosaurs|journal=BMC Health Services Research|volume=7|pages=94|doi=10.1186/1472-6963-7-94|pmid=17594476|pmc=1934356}}</ref> For instance, it is difficult for Bismarck Systems to contend with aging populations, as these demographics are less economically active.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Joël|first1=Marie-Eve|last2=Dufour-Kippelen|first2=Sandrine|date=August 2002|title=Financing systems of care for older persons in Europe|journal=Aging Clinical and Experimental Research|volume=14|issue=4|pages=293–299|doi=10.1007/bf03324453|pmid=12462375|s2cid=43533840|issn=1594-0667}}</ref> Ultimately, this model has more flexibility than a traditional Bismarck or Beveridge model, as it can pull effective practices from both systems as needed.

This model maintains private providers, but payment comes directly from the government.{{cn|date=June 2020}} Insurance plans control costs by paying for limited services. In some instances, citizens can opt out of public insurance for private insurance plans. However, large public insurance programs provide the government with bargaining power, allowing them to drive down prices for certain services and medication. In Canada, for instance, drug prices have been extensively lowered by the [[Patented Medicine Prices Review Board]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Office|first=U.S. Government Accountability|date=1993-02-22|title=Prescription Drug Prices: Analysis of Canada's Patented Medicine Prices Review Board|url=https://www.gao.gov/products/HRD-93-51|issue=HRD-93-51}}</ref> Examples of this model can be found in Canada, Taiwan, and South Korea.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The healing of America : a global quest for better, cheaper, and fairer health care|url=https://archive.org/details/healingofamerica00reid|url-access=registration|last=Reid|first=T R|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2009}}</ref>

=== Out-of-pocket model ===
In areas with low levels of government stability or poverty, there is often no mechanism for ensuring that health costs are covered by a party other than the individual. In this case patients must pay for services on their own.<ref name=":03"/> Payment methods can vary—ranging from physical currency, to trade for goods and services.<ref name=":03"/>  Those that cannot afford treatment typically remain sick or die.<ref name=":03"/>

=== Inefficiencies ===
In countries where insurance is not mandated, there can be gaps in coverage—especially among disadvantaged and impoverished communities that can not afford private plans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/|title=The Coverage Gap: Uninsured Poor Adults in States that Do Not Expand Medicaid|date=2018-06-12|work=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>  The UK National Health System creates excellent patient outcomes and mandates universal coverage but also suffers from large lag times for treatment. Critics argue that reforms brought about by the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]] only proved to fragment the system, leading to high regulatory burden and long treatment delays.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Group|first=British Medical Journal Publishing|date=2013-04-05|title=Implementation of the Health and Social Care Act|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f2173|journal=BMJ|volume=346|pages=f2173|doi=10.1136/bmj.f2173|issn=1756-1833|doi-access=free}}</ref> In his review of NHS leadership in 2015, Sir Stuart Rose concluded that "the NHS is drowning in bureaucracy."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-leadership-for-tomorrow-nhs-leadership-review|title=Better leadership for tomorrow: NHS leadership review|website=GOV.UK|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>
