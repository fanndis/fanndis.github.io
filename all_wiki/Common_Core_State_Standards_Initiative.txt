The '''Common Core State Standards Initiative''' is an educational initiative from 2010 that details what [[K–12]] students throughout the [[United States]] should know in [[Language arts|English language arts]]<!--Please do not edit punctuation in "English language arts" which is a single term--> and [[mathematics]] at the conclusion of each [[Educational stage|school grade]]. The initiative is sponsored by the following organizations: 

* [[National Governors Association]] (NGA)
* [[Council of Chief State School Officers]] (CCSSO) 

The initiative also seeks to establish consistent educational standards across the states as well as ensure that students graduating from high school are prepared to enter credit-bearing courses at two- or four-year college programs or to enter the [[workforce]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative |url=http://www.corestandards.org/resources/frequently-asked-questions |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

==Background==
In the 1990s, a movement began in the U.S. to establish national educational standards for students across the country. 

* (a) outlining what students were expected to know and do at each grade level 
* (b) implementing ways to find out if they were meeting those standards.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gibbs |first1=T.

==Development==
In 2009, the [[National Governors Association|NGA]] convened a group of people to work on developing the standards. This team included [[David Coleman (consultant)|David Coleman]], [[William G. McCallum|William McCallum]] of the [[University of Arizona]], Phil Daro, and Student Achievement Partners founders Jason Zimba<ref>Hess, Frederick (February 28, 2013).

It also requires attribution and a copyright notice, except when a state or territory has adopted the standards "in whole."

When the CCSS was originally published, there was no intention to publish a common set of standards for English language proficiency development (ELPD). Instead, it was indicated that the ELPD standards would be left to individual states.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tesol.org/docs/advocacy/overview-of-common-core-state-standards-initiatives-for-ells-a-tesol-issue-brief-march-2013.pdf?sfvrsn=4 |title=Overview of the Common Core State Standards Initiatives for ELLs}}</ref> However, the need for more guidance quickly became apparent, and led to the creation of several initiatives to provide resources to states and educators, including:
* [[WIDA Consortium|WIDA]], which is a consortium that produces standardized tests aimed at [[English-language learner|English Language Learners]] (ELLs), more properly known as [[English as an Additional Language]] (EAL) students, that is used in multiple states.  It is still updating its standards in order to align with CCSS.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.colorincolorado.org/article/standards-impact-english-language-learners|title=Standards That Impact English Language Learners|last=Staehr Fenner|first=Diane|date=2012-03-09|work=Colorín Colorado|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}</ref>
* An English language proficiency development framework from The Council of Chief State School Officers, which assists states in revising their ELPD standards to align to both the CSS and Next Generation Science Standards.<ref name=":1" /> 
* Both the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) and the [[TESOL International Association]] are involved in establishing the standards for ESL instruction, but as of yet there isn't a standardized set of qualifications across the country for ESL instruction.<ref name=":2" />
The U.S. Department of Education has since funded two grants to develop the next generation of ELPD assessments, which must measure students’ proficiency against a set of common ELPD standards, which in turn correspond to the college/career-ready standards in English language arts and mathematics.<ref name=":1" />  The new assessment system must also:

* Be based on a common definition of English language learner adopted by all consortium states.
* Include diagnostic (e.g., screener, placement) and summative assessments.
* Assess English language proficiency across the four language domains (reading, writing, speaking, and listening) for each grade level from kindergarten through grade 12.
* Produce results that indicate whether individual students have attained a level and complexity of English language proficiency that is necessary to fully participate in academic instruction in English.
* Be accessible to all ELLs, except those who are eligible for alternate assessments based on alternate academic standards.
* Use technology to the maximum extent appropriate to develop, administer, and score assessments.<ref name=":1" />

==Adoption==

Since 2010, forty-one (41) of the fifty U.S. states and the [[District of Columbia]] have been members of the Common Core State Standards Initiative, while [[Alabama]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[Alaska]], [[Nebraska]], [[Indiana]] and [[South Carolina]] did not adopt the initiative at a state level.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.corestandards.org/in-the-states |title=States adopting the Core Standards |publisher= Corestandards.org |accessdate= June 27, 2014}}</ref> [[Minnesota]] adopted the English Language Arts standards but not the Mathematics standards.<ref name="minnesota.publicradio.org">[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/06/12/daily-circuit-minnesota-adopting-common-core "Why Did Minnesota Skip the Math Common Core Standards?"].

Standards were released for mathematics and English language arts on June 2, 2010, with a majority of states adopting the standards in the subsequent months. States were given an incentive to adopt the Common Core Standards through the possibility of competitive federal [[Race to the Top]] grants. U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of Education|U.S. Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] announced the Race to the Top competitive grants on July 24, 2009, as a motivator for education reform. To be eligible, states had to adopt "internationally benchmarked standards and assessments that prepare students for success in college and the work place."<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] |title=President Obama, U.S. Secretary of Education Duncan Announce National Competition to Advance School Reform |date=July 24, 2009 |accessdate=February 18, 2014 |url=http://www2.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2009/07/07242009.html}}</ref> Though states could adopt other college- and career-ready standards and still be eligible, they were awarded extra points in their Race to the Top applications if they adopted the Common Core standards by August 2, 2010. Forty-one states made the promise in their application.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fletcher |first=G. H. |year=2010 |title=Race to the Top: No District Left Behind |journal= [[T. H. E.

Until the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]] was passed in December 2015, the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]] had encouraged states to adopt the Common Core Standards by tying the grant of waivers from the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] to adoption of the Standards. However, the Every Student Succeeds Act not only replaced the No Child Left Behind Act, it also expressly prohibits the Department of Education from attempting to "influence, incentivize, or coerce State adoption of the Common Core State Standards ... or any other academic standards common to a significant number of States."<ref>{{cite news |last= Korte|first= Gregory|date=December 11, 2015|title= The Every Student Succeeds Act vs. No Child Left Behind: What's changed?|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/12/10/every-student-succeeds-act-vs-no-child-left-behind-whats-changed/77088780/|newspaper= USA Today|access-date= December 18, 2015}}</ref>

Though the Common Core State Standards do not cover science and social studies content standards, the [[Next Generation Science Standards]] were released in April 2012 and have been adopted by many states. They are not directly related to the Common Core, but their content can be cross-connected to the mathematical and English Language Arts standards within the Common Core.<ref>{{cite web |title=Appendix L — Connections to the Common Core Standards for Mathematics |publisher=Next Generation Science Standards |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/sites/ngss/files/Appendix-L_CCSS%20Math%20Connections%2006_03_13.pdf |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Appendix M — Connections to the Common Core Standards for Literacy in Science and Technical Subjects |publisher=Next Generation Science Standards |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/sites/ngss/files/Appendix%20M%20Connections%20to%20the%20CCSS%20for%20Literacy_061213.pdf |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref>

==English Language Arts standards==
The stated goal of the English Language Arts and Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects standards<ref>{{cite web |title=Common Core State Standards For English Language Arts & Literacy In History/Social Studies, Science, And Technical Subjects |publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative |url=http://www.corestandards.org/assets/CCSSI_ELA%20Standards.pdf |accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> is to ensure that students are college and career ready in literacy no later than the end of high school. There are five key components to the standards for English and Language Arts: Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Language, and Media and Technology.<ref name=keyela>{{cite web |title=Key Points in English Language Arts |publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative |url=http://www.corestandards.org/resources/key-points-in-english-language-arts |accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> The essential components and breakdown of each of these key points within the standards are as follows:

;Reading
* As students advance through each grade, there is an increased level of complexity to what students are expected to read and there is also a progressive development of reading comprehension so that students can gain more from what they read.<ref name=keyela/>
* Teachers, school districts, and states are expected to decide on the appropriate curriculum, but sample texts are included to help teachers, students, and parents prepare for the year ahead.<ref name=keyela/> Molly Walsh of [[Burlington Free Press]] notes an appendix (of state standards for reading material) that lists "exemplar texts" from works by noted authors such as [[Ovid]], [[Voltaire]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Robert Frost]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and the more contemporary, including, [[Amy Tan]], [[Atul Gawande]] and [[Julia Alvarez]].<ref name="bfp100914">{{Cite news|first=Molly |last=Walsh |title=Vermont Joins 30 Others in Common Core |url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20100914/NEWS02/100913028/Vermont-schools-study-new-standards |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731040559/http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20100914/NEWS02/100913028/Vermont-schools-study-new-standards |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 31, 2012 |work=[[The Burlington Free Press]] |page=1B |date=September 14, 2010 }}</ref> 
* There is some critical content for all students{{spaced ndash}} classic myths and stories from around the world, foundational U.S. documents, seminal works of American literature, and the writings of Shakespeare{{spaced ndash}} but the rest is left up to the states and the districts.<ref name=keyela/>
* Standards for Reading Foundational Skills are described for kindergarten to grade five. They include the areas of print concepts, [[phonological awareness]], [[phonics]] and word recognition, and [[fluency]]. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/ |title= English Language Arts Standards, Retrieved May 14, 2020}}</ref> Specific teaching suggestions and research are contained in the Appendices, where “phonics” is referred to as “[[Phoneme]]-[[Grapheme]] Correspondences”. <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.corestandards.org/assets/Appendix_A.pdf |title=Appendix A, research supporting Key elements of the standards, corestandards.org, Retrieved May 14, 2020}}</ref>
;Writing
* The driving force of the writing standards is logical arguments based on claims, solid reasoning, and relevant evidence. The writing also includes opinion writing even within the K–5 standards.<ref name=keyela/>
* Short, focused research projects, similar to the kind of projects students will face in their careers, as well as long-term, in-depth research is another piece of the writing standards. This is because written analysis and the presentation of significant findings are critical to career and college readiness.<ref name=keyela/>
* The standards also include annotated samples of student writing to help determine performance levels in writing arguments, explanatory texts, and narratives across the grades.<ref name=keyela/>

;Speaking and listening
* Although reading and writing are the expected components of an English language arts curriculum, standards are written so that students gain, evaluate, and present complex information, ideas, and evidence specifically through listening and speaking.<ref name=keyela/>
* There is also an emphasis on academic discussion in one-on-one, small-group, and whole-class settings, which can take place as formal presentations or informal discussions during student collaboration.<ref name=keyela/>

;Language
* Vocabulary instruction in the standards takes place through a mix of conversations, direct instruction, and reading so that students can determine word meanings and can expand their use of words and phrases.<ref name=keyela/>
* The standards expect students to use formal English in their writing and speaking, but also recognize that colleges and 21st-century careers will require students to make wise, skilled decisions about how to express themselves through language in a variety of contexts.<ref name=keyela/>
* Vocabulary and conventions are their own strand because these skills extend across reading, writing, speaking, and listening.<ref name=keyela/>

;Media and technology
* Since media and technology are intertwined with every student's life and in school in the 21st century, skills related to media use, which includes the analysis and production of various forms of media, are also included in these standards.<ref name=keyela/>
* The standards include instruction in [[keyboarding]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/01/hawaii-no-longer-requires_n_915402.html |title=Hawaii No Longer Requires Teaching Cursive In Schools | work = [[The Huffington Post]] |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 9, 2014 |first=Emmeline |last=Zhao}}</ref> but do not mandate the teaching of [[cursive]] handwriting.

==Mathematics standards==
The stated goal of the mathematics standards is to achieve greater focus and coherence in the curriculum.<ref>{{cite web |title=Common Core State Standards for Mathematics |publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative |page=3 |url=http://www.corestandards.org/assets/CCSSI_Math%20Standards.pdf |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}</ref> This is largely in response to the criticism that American mathematics curricula are "a mile wide and an inch deep".<ref>{{cite web|title=Mathematics|url=http://www.corestandards.org/math|publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref>

The mathematics standards include Standards for Mathematical Practice and Standards for Mathematical Content.

===Mathematical practice===
{{Sidebar
| name = Common Core State Standards Initiative
| heading1 = Example: Sixth practice
| heading2 = Attend to precision (Full text)
| contentstyle = text-align: left
| content2 = Mathematically proficient students try to communicate precisely to others. They try to use clear definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning. They state the meaning of the symbols they choose, including using the equal sign consistently and appropriately. They are careful about specifying units of measure, and labeling axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. They calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of precision appropriate for the problem context. In the elementary grades, students give carefully formulated explanations to each other. By the time they reach high school they have learned to examine claims and make explicit use of definitions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Standards for Mathematical Practice|url=http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice/|website=corestandards.org|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref>}}
The Standards mandate that eight principles of mathematical practice be taught:<ref>{{cite web |title=Common Core State Standards for Mathematics |publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative |page=6 |url=http://www.corestandards.org/assets/CCSSI_Math%20Standards.pdf |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}</ref>
# Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
# Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
# Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.
# Model with mathematics.
# Use appropriate tools strategically.
# Attend to precision.
# Look for and make use of structure.
# Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

The practices are adapted from the five [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics#Process standards|process standards]] of the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] and the five strands of proficiency in the [[United States National Research Council|U.S. National Research Council]]'s ''Adding It Up'' report.<ref>Garfunkel, S. A. (2010). "The National Standards Train: You Need to Buy Your Ticket". ''[[The UMAP Journal]]. 31 (4): 277–280.</ref> These practices are to be taught in every grade from kindergarten to twelfth grade. Details of how these practices are to be connected to each grade level's mathematics content are left to local implementation of the Standards.

===Mathematical content===
The standards lay out the mathematics content that should be learned at each grade level from kindergarten to Grade 8 (age 13–14), as well as the mathematics to be learned in high school. The standards do not dictate any particular [[pedagogy]] or what order topics should be taught within a particular grade level. Mathematical content is organized in a number of ''domains''. At each grade level there are several ''standards'' for each domain, organized into ''clusters'' of related standards. (See [[Common Core State Standards Initiative#Examples of mathematical content|examples]] below.)

In addition to detailed standards (of which there are 21 to 28 for each grade from kindergarten to eighth grade), the standards present an overview of "critical areas" for each grade. (See [[Common Core State Standards Initiative#Examples of mathematical content|examples]] below.)

In high school (Grades 9 to 12), the standards do not specify which content is to be taught at each grade level, nor does the Common Core prescribe how a particular standard should be taught. Up to Grade 8, the curriculum is [[Integrated mathematics|integrated]]; students study four or five different mathematical domains every year. The standards do not dictate whether the curriculum should continue to be integrated in high school with study of several domains each year (as is done in other countries), or whether the curriculum should be separated out into separate year-long algebra and geometry courses (as has been the tradition in most U.S. states). An appendix<ref>{{cite web |title=Common Core State Standards for Mathematics: Appendix A: Designing High School Mathematics Courses Based on Common Core State Standards |publisher=Common Core Standards Initiative |url=http://www.corestandards.org/assets/CCSSI_Mathematics_Appendix_A.pdf |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}</ref> to the standards describes four possible pathways for covering high school content (two traditional and two integrated), but states are free to organize the content any way they want.

There are six conceptual ''categories'' of content to be covered at the high school level:
* Number, and quantity;
* [[Algebra]];
* [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]];
* [[Mathematical model|Modeling]];
* [[Geometry]];
* [[Statistics]] and [[Probability theory|probability]].

Some topics in each category are indicated only for students intending to take more advanced, optional courses such as [[calculus]], advanced statistics, or [[discrete mathematics]]. Even if the traditional sequence is adopted, functions and modeling are to be integrated across the curriculum, not taught as separate courses. Mathematical Modeling is a Standard for Mathematical Practice (see [[Common Core State Standards Initiative#Mathematical practice|above]]), and is meant to be integrated across the entire curriculum beginning in kindergarten. The modeling category does not have its own standards; instead, high school standards in other categories which are intended to be considered part of the modeling category are indicated in the standards with a star symbol.

Each of the six high school categories includes a number of domains. For example, the "number and quantity" category contains four domains: the [[Real number|real number system]]; quantities; the [[Complex number|complex number system]]; and [[Euclidean vector|vector]] and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] quantities. The "vector and matrix quantities" domain is reserved for advanced students, as are some of the standards in "the complex number system".

====Examples of mathematical content====
'''Second grade example:''' In the second grade there are 26 standards in four domains. The four critical areas of focus for second grade are (1) extending understanding of base-ten notation; (2) building fluency with addition and subtraction; (3) using standard units of measure; and (4) describing and analyzing shapes. Below are the second grade standards for the domain of "operations and algebraic thinking" (Domain 2.OA). This second grade domain contains four standards, organized into three clusters:<ref>{{cite web |title=Common Core State Standards for Mathematics |publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative |page=17 |url=http://www.corestandards.org/assets/CCSSI_Math%20Standards.pdf |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}</ref>

=== Key shifts ===
The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics shifted the way the United States teaches math in three core ways. They built on the pre-existing standards to emphasize the skills and knowledge students will not only need in college, but in their career and in life as well. <ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/other-resources/key-shifts-in-mathematics/|title=Key Shifts in Mathematics {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|website=www.corestandards.org|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> The key shifts are:<ref name=":3" />

# Greater focus on fewer topics
# Coherence: Linking topics and thinking across grades
# Rigor: Pursue conceptual understanding, procedural skills and fluency, and application with equal intensity

Here is the description as an example of one of the key shifts: <ref name=":3" /><blockquote>'''Greater <u>focus</u> on fewer topics:'''

The Common Core calls for greater focus in mathematics. Rather than racing to cover many topics in a mile-wide, inch deep curriculum, the standards ask math teachers to significantly narrow and deepen the way time and energy are spent in the classroom. This means focusing deeply on the major work of each grade as follows:

* In grades K-2: Concepts, skills, and problem solving related to addition and subtraction
* In grades 3-5: Concepts, skills, and problem solving related to multiplication and division of whole numbers and fractions
* In grade 6: Ratios and proportional relationships, and early algebraic expressions and equations
* In grade 7: Ratios and proportional relationships, and arithmetic of rational numbers
* In grade 8: Linear algebra and linear functions

This focus will help students gain strong foundations, including a solid understanding of concepts, a high degree of procedural skill and fluency, and the ability to apply the math they know to solve problems inside and outside the classroom.</blockquote>

==Assessment==
{{Update|section|date=September 2016}}
According to the Common Core State Standards Initiative website, formal assessment is expected to take place in the 2014–2015 school year, which coincides with the projected implementation year for most states.<ref>{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Common Core Standards Initiative |url=http://www.corestandards.org/resources/frequently-asked-questions}}</ref> The assessment is being created by two consortia with different approaches.<ref name=coalitions>{{cite web |title=Education Insider: Common Core State Standards and Assessment Coalitions |publisher=[[Whiteboard Advisors]] |date=September 9, 2010 |url=http://www.whiteboardadvisors.com/research/education-insider-common-core-standards-and-assessment-coalitions |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202233810/http://www.whiteboardadvisors.com/research/education-insider-common-core-standards-and-assessment-coalitions |archive-date=February 2, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The final decision of which assessment to use will be determined by individual state education agencies. Both of these leading consortiums are proposing computer-based exams that include fewer selected and constructed response test items, unlike the [[Standardized test|Standardized Test]] that has been more common.

* The PARCC RttT Assessment Consortium comprises the 19 jurisdictions of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Tennessee.

([[PARCC]] refers to "Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers" and RttT refers to the [[Race to the Top]].)<ref name=coalitions/>
* The second consortium, called the [[Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium]], comprised 31 states and territories (as of January 2014) focusing on creating "adaptive online exams". Member states include Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, U.S. Virgin Islands, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.<ref name=coalitions/><ref>{{cite web |title=Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium |url=http://www.smarterbalanced.org |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}</ref>

==Reception and criticism==
The Common Core State Standards have drawn both support and criticism from politicians, analysts, and commentators. Teams of academics and educators from around the United States led the development of the standards, and additional validation teams approved the final standards. The teams drew on public feedback that was solicited throughout the process and that feedback was incorporated into the standards.<ref name="Truth">{{cite web | title=The Truth About Common Core | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/344519/truth-about-common-core-kathleen-porter-magee | date=April 3, 2013 | author= Porter-Magee, Kathleen | work= [[National Review]] | accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref> The Common Core initiative only specifies what students should know at each grade level and describes the skills that they must acquire in order to achieve college or career readiness. Individual school districts are responsible for choosing curricula based on the standards.<ref name="Truth"/> Textbooks bearing a Common Core label are not verified by any agency and may or may not represent the intent of the Common Core Standards. Some critics believe most current textbooks are not actually aligned to the Common Core, while others disagree.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Review of Math Programs Comes Under Fire | url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/03/18/review-of-math-programs-comes-under-fire.html | date=March 17, 2015 | author= Heitin, Liana | work= Education Week | accessdate=October 26, 2017}}</ref>

The mathematicians [[Edward Frenkel]] and Hung-Hsi Wu wrote in 2013 that the mathematical education in the United States is in "deep crisis" caused by the way math is currently taught in schools. Both agree that math textbooks, which are widely adopted across the states, already create "mediocre de facto national standards". The texts, they say, "are often incomprehensible and irrelevant". The Common Core State Standards address these issues and "level the playing field" for students. They point out that adoption of the Common Core State Standards and how best to test students are two separate issues.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Republicans Should Love Common Core |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324482504578453502155934978 |date=May 6, 2013 |author=Frenkel, Edward |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref>

In 2012, Tom Loveless of the [[Brookings Institution]] called into question whether the standards will have any effect, and said that they "have done little to equalize academic achievement within states".<ref name=Toppo/> In response to the standards, the libertarian [[Cato Institute]] claimed that "it is not the least bit paranoid to say the federal government wants a national curriculum."<ref name=Toppo>{{cite news |title=Common Core Standards Drive Wedge in Education Circles |author= Toppo, Greg |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/story/2012-04-28/common-core-education/54583192/1 |work= [[USA Today]] |date=May 1, 2012 |accessdate= March 23, 2013}}</ref> According to a study published by the [[Pioneer Institute]], although the standards themselves are sound, their method of implementation has failed to deliver improvements in literacy, while numeracy has actually declined, due to the imposition of the mediocre curriculum sequences used in a number of mid-performing states, and the "progressive" teaching methods that are popular among Common Core developers.<ref>{{Citation

Kentucky was the first to implement the Common Core State Standards, and local school districts began offering new math and English curricula based on the standard in August 2010. In 2013, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that the high school graduation rate had increased from 80 percent in 2010 to 86 percent in 2013, test scores went up 2 percentage points in the second year of using the Common Core test, and the percentage of students considered to be ready for college or a career, based on a battery of assessments, went up from 34 percent in 2010 to 54 percent in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |first=Amanda |last=Ripley |title=The New Smart Set: What Happens When Millions of Kids Are Asked to Master Fewer Things More Deeply? |magazine= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 30, 2013 |page=36}}</ref> According to Sarah Butrymowicz from ''[[The Atlantic]]'',
<blockquote>Kentucky's experience over the past three school years suggests it will be a slow and potentially frustrating road ahead for the other states that are using the Common Core. Test scores are still dismal, and state officials have expressed concern that the pace of improvement is not fast enough. Districts have also seen varying success in changing how teachers teach, something that was supposed to change under the new standards.<ref name=Atlantic>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Butrymowicz |title=What Kentucky Can Teach the Rest of the U.S. About the Common Core | work = [[The Atlantic]] |date=October 15, 2013 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/what-kentucky-can-teach-the-rest-of-the-us-about-the-common-core/280453/ |accessdate=December 20, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

The Common Core State Standards are considered to be more rigorous than the standards they replaced in Kentucky. Kentucky's old standards received a "D" in an analysis by the [[Thomas B. Fordham Institute]]. School officials in Kentucky believe it will take several more years to adjust to the new standards, which received an A- in math and a B+ in English from the Fordham Institute.<ref name=Atlantic/><ref>{{cite news |title=The Commonwealth of Common Core: What Florida Can Learn from Kentucky |author= O'Connor, John |url=http://stateimpact.npr.org/florida/2013/10/21/the-commonwealth-of-common-core-what-florida-can-learn-from-kentucky/ |publisher= [[NPR]] |date=October 21, 2013 |accessdate=November 18, 2013}}</ref>
