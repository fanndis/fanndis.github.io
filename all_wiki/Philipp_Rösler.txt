'''Philipp Rösler''', {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Merit (Portugal)|GOM]]}} (born 24 February 1973)<ref>Rösler's exact date of birth is unknown; 24 February 1973 is used in official documents.</ref> is a German physician and former politician who served as [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany)|Federal Minister of Economics and Technology]] and [[Vice Chancellor of Germany]] from 2011 to 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr. Philipp Rösler |url=http://www.bmwi.de/EN/Ministry/Minister-and-State-Secretaries/roesler.html |publisher=[[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]] |accessdate=13 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131213154922/http://www.bmwi.de/EN/Ministry/Minister-and-State-Secretaries/roesler.html |archivedate=13 December 2013 }}</ref>

Rösler was also Chairman of the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) from 2011 to 2013.

Born in [[Vietnam]], Rösler was the first cabinet minister of Asian background in Germany.<ref name=spiegel9>{{cite news |title=German Parties Agree on New Coalition |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/sealing-the-deal-german-parties-agree-on-new-coalition-a-657166.html |accessdate=4 September 2012 |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=24 October 2009 }}</ref>  Before entering politics, Rösler was a cardiothoracic surgeon.

==Early life and education==
Rösler was born in Khánh Hung, Ba Xuyên Province, in [[South Vietnam]] (now [[Sóc Trăng Province]], Vietnam) on 24 February 1973.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/politik/2009/11/01/philipp-roesler-schwester-mary/besuch-im-waisenheim.html|date=1 November 2009|accessdate=2 November 2009|title=Erinnern Sie sich an diesen Waisenjungen, Schwester?|author=Von Jurgen Damsch|work=[[Bild|Das Bild]]}}</ref><ref name="de">{{cite web|url=http://www.landtag-niedersachsen.de/Abgeordnete/abgeordnete.htmlandtag-niedersachsen.de|title=Abgeordnete - Niedersächsischer Landtag |publisher=Landtag-niedersachsen|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> No information regarding Rösler's Vietnamese birth parents is known (which is why he has no [[Vietnamese name]]).

Rösler grew up in [[Hamburg]], [[Bückeburg]] and [[Hanover]], where he graduated from high school in 1992.<ref name=gmissions>{{cite web|title=Diversity in Germany's cabinet|url=http://www.southafrica.diplo.de/Vertretung/suedafrika/en/10__GIC/02__GL/Diversity/R_C3_B6sler.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105190824/http://www.southafrica.diplo.de/Vertretung/suedafrika/en/10__GIC/02__GL/Diversity/R_C3_B6sler.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 January 2013|publisher=German Missions|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> After training to become a [[combat medic]] in the German {{lang|de|[[Bundeswehr]]}} (the Federal Defence Force), Rösler was accepted to study medicine at the [[Hannover Medical School|Hanover Medical School]].

==Political career==
===State politics===

Rösler joined the FDP and its political youth organization, the [[Young Liberals (Germany)|Young Liberals]], in 1992.<ref name=local/> He was secretary of the FDP in the state of [[Lower Saxony]] from 2000 to 2004 and served as chairman of the FDP parliamentary group in the [[Landtag of Lower Saxony|Lower Saxon state assembly]] from 2003. From 2001 to 2006, Rösler was a member in the regional assembly of Hanover (district), where he was also deputy chairman of the parliamentary group. In May 2005, he was elected an observer of the federal FDP executive committee. He received 95% of the votes, the best result of that party conference. At the state party conference in March 2006, Rösler was elected as chairman of the Lower Saxon FDP with 96.4% of the votes; he succeeded Walter Hirche, who had decided to step down after twelve years at the helm. In April 2008, Rösler was confirmed as the Lower Saxon FDP party chairman, receiving 95% of the votes.

At the federal party conference in June 2007, Rösler was re-elected as a member of the party executive committee. The following month, he was elected to stand as his party’s main candidate in the [[2008 Lower Saxony state election|Lower Saxon state election]] in January 2008. In that election, he received 10.9% of the votes in his local constituency, {{lang|de|[[Hanover]]-Döhren}}. On 18 February 2008, Rösler was appointed State Minister for Economic Affairs, Labour and Transport<ref>[https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/blitzkarriere-an-der-leine;2120933 handelsblatt.com]</ref> as well as Deputy Minister-President in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Lower Saxony|Minister-President]] [[Christian Wulff]] of Lower Saxony.

===Role in federal politics===
====Federal Minister of Health, 2009–2011====

Following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 national elections]], Rösler succeeded [[Ulla Schmidt]] as [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Minister of Health]] in [[Angela Merkel]]'s [[Second Merkel cabinet|second cabinet]].<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,657086,00.html Spiegel.de]</ref>

Over the course of 2010, Rösler pushed through [[AMNOG|changes to the way drugs are priced]] on the German market as part of his wider-ranging health-care reform plans.<ref>Nicole Goebel (10 March 2010), [Berlin takes aim at drug makers in health-care reform bid] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref> In January 2011, he asked German pharmaceutical companies to refrain from delivering anesthetic [[sodium thiopental]] to the US, a request they agreed to. Later that year, he declined a request from his counterpart, [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] [[Gary Locke]], that Germany help out with thiopental as dozens of US states were facing shortages of a drug necessary in [[lethal injection]]s administered to death-row prisoners.<ref>Charles Hawley (9 June 2011), [European Opposition to Death Penalty: German Minister Denies US Request for Execution Drugs] ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.</ref>

====Vice-Chancellor and Federal Minister of Economics and Technology, 2011–2013====
Rösler succeeded [[Rainer Brüderle]] as [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|Federal Minister of Economics and Technology]] on 12 May 2011 and [[Guido Westerwelle]] as Chairman of the FDP on 13 May 2011 and was also instated as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]] on 16 May 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gessat|first=Michael|title=Vietnam-born doctor takes reins of German liberal party|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=13 May 2011|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15073300,00.html|accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref><ref name="appointment">{{cite news|title=Philipp Rösler neuer Vizekanzler|publisher=[[German government]]|language=German|date=18 May 2011|url=http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_1264/Content/DE/Artikel/2011/05/2011-05-18-vizekanzler-roesler.html|accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref>

On 7 June 2011, Rösler attended the [[state dinner]] hosted by President [[Barack Obama]] in honor of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] at the [[White House]].<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/06/07/expected-attendees-tonights-state-dinner Expected Attendees at Tonight's State Dinner] [[Office of the First Lady of the United States]], press release of 7 June 2011.</ref>

Rösler strongly supported the presidential candidacy of [[Joachim Gauck]], originally proposed by the SPD and Greens, and reportedly secured his nomination by convincing his opposing coalition partner, the [[CDU/CSU]], to back the nomination. That was seen as a step to demonstrate the independence of his party which was dramatically trailing in polls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/schwarz-gelb-nach-der-entscheidung-fuer-gauck-roesler-feiert-einen-gefaehrlichen-sieg-1.1288748 |title=FDP beharrt auf Gauck: Rösler feiert gefährlichen Sieg - Politik |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref>

As a consequence of the FDP's defeat in the [[2013 Lower Saxony state election|2013 state elections]] in [[Lower Saxony]], Rösler offered to step down as party chairman. The leadership decided that he would remain but not lead the party in the federal elections, instead acting in a team with [[Rainer Brüderle]] as top candidate.<ref>Melissa Eddy and Nicholas Kulish (21 January 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/world/europe/center-left-defeats-merkels-party-in-state-vote.html Merkel’s Strong Standing Takes a Hit in Local German Elections] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Following the defeat of [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal elections]], when the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] was for first time in its history voted out of the Bundestag, he stepped down as chairman and retired from politics. [[Christian Lindner]] became his successor as leader of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]].

==Life after politics==
In January 2014 Rösler became a member of the managing board and Head of the Centre for Regional Strategies of the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) in Switzerland, under the leadership of chairman [[Klaus Schwab]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/contributors/philipp-roesler|title=E: Philipp Rösler|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=9 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205231314/http://www.weforum.org/contributors/philipp-roesler|archivedate=5 February 2014}}</ref> From late 2017 until early 2019, Rösler served as chief executive officer of New York-based Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation Inc., the largest shareholder of [[HNA Group]].<ref>Eyk Henning (7 November 2017), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-07/hna-top-owner-is-said-to-name-ex-german-vice-chancellor-as-chief HNA’s Top Owner Is Said to Name Ex-German Minister as Chief] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref><ref>Michael B.
