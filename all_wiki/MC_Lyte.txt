(Hoe)." At the beginning of that same year, Lyte joined [[Stop the Violence Movement]] with [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] and [[Heavy D]], among others.

Unplugged Rap", the first [[MTV Unplugged]] to feature rap artists, alongside [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[De La Soul]] and [[LL Cool J]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ozy.com/good-sht/when-hip-hop-plugged-into-unplugged/33599/ |title=When Hip-Hop Plugged Into 'Unplugged' |website=TV OZY |date=September 23, 2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2020}}</ref> In September 1991 Lyte released her third album, ''[[Act Like You Know (MC Lyte album)|Act Like You Know]]'', featuring a [[new jack swing]] sound. Even though singles "Poor Georgie" and "When in Love" peaked at # 1 and # 3 on the Hot Rap Singles respectively, the album fell in the charts, only peaking at #102 on the [[Billboard 200]] and #14 on the Top [[R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] and reviews were generally mixed. That year she also participated in the socially conscious single "Heal Yourself" by the collective "HEAL Human Education Against Lies", which also included [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Run-DMC]], [[Queen Latifah]] and LL Cool J.

For 1992 she began work on her next album, titled ''[[Ain't No Other]]'', released on June 22, 1993.

Following the single "[[Ruffneck (song)|Ruffneck]],"<ref name=clip /> (her third song # 1 on the rap list, # 10 on the Hot R & B / Hip-Hop Songs and # 35 on the Billboard Hot 100), which sold half a million copies, she became the first female rapper to achieve gold certification as a solo artist, in addition to earning a [[Grammy Award]] nomination in the [[Best Rap Solo Performance]] category.

In August 1996, after signing with [[Elektra Records]] affiliate [[East West Records |East West]], Lyte released the fifth album of her career, ''[[Bad as I Wanna B]]''. With a sound more oriented to [[R&B]] and [[dance music]], it became one of her most commercially successful albums. On this album she had the two most commercially successful singles of her career: "[[Keep On Keepin' On (MC Lyte song)|Keep On Keepin' On]]" featuring the R&B group [[Xscape (vocal group)|Xscape]] (# 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and # 3 on Hot R & B / Hip-Hop Songs and # 27 on the UK Singles Chart) and the [[Puff Daddy]] [[remix]] of his song "[[Cold Rock a Party]]", (# 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, her fourth # 1 on the Hot Rap Songs chart and # 14 in the UK between other charts in Europe), featuring [[Missy Elliott]].<ref name= clip />{{rp|8}} With both she achieved gold certifications in the US market, and for "Keep On Keepin 'On" she also won a [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train]] Lady of Soul Awards in the category of best R&B, Soul or Rap video.
