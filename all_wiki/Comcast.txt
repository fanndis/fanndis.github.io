{{See also|Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney}}
On November 16, 2017, it was reported that Comcast attempted to purchase [[21st Century Fox]], following the news 10 days earlier that The Walt Disney Company negotiated with Fox to acquire the same assets. Like Disney, the deal included the 20th Century Fox film and television studios, cable entertainment and broadcast satellite networks including [[FX (TV channel)|FX Networks]], [[National Geographic Partners]], [[Fox Sports Networks]], and international channels such as [[Star India]]. It would not include the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], [[Fox Television Stations]], [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and [[Fox News]] units, all which will be spun-off into a new independent company,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/comcast-21st-century-fox-acquisition-talks-report-1202210244/|title=Comcast-Fox Deal Talks Latest Entry Into Media Merger Mania|last1=C.

On February 5, 2018, a new report by CNBC claims that despite the Disney/Fox deal, Comcast was considering topping Disney's $52.4 billion offer once the [[AT&T]]–[[Time Warner]] merger goes through, after the Department of Justice Antitrust Division sued to block the merger on November 20, 2017.

On May 7, 2018, Comcast announced a potential bid against Disney's effort to acquire Fox after it spoke to investment banks about making a $60 billion cash offer, pending on approval of the AT&T–Time Warner merger.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/4-reasons-comcast-covets-fox/|title=4 reasons Comcast covets Fox|last=Gibson|first=Kate|work=CBS|date=May 7, 2018}}</ref> On May 15, several Fox investors expressed interests in inking a deal with Comcast due to their all-cash offer as opposed to Disney's $52.4 billion stock offer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/15/comcasts-all-cash-bid-could-pit-murdoch-against-fox-shareholders.html|title=Comcast's all-cash bid could pit Murdoch against Fox shareholders|work=CNBC|date=May 15, 2018|access-date=May 15, 2018}}</ref> On June 13, Comcast officially announced a $65 billion counter-offer to acquire the 21st Century Fox's assets that Disney offered to purchase.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/13/17457244/comcast-21st-century-fox-film-tv-studios-acquisition-deal-announced|title=Comcast makes $65 billion offer to steal 21st Century Fox away from Disney|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-06-13}}</ref>

However, on June 20, 2018, Disney and Fox announced that they had amended their previous merger agreement, upping Disney's offer to $71.3 billion (a 10% premium over Comcast's $65 billion offer), while also offering shareholders the option of receiving cash instead of stock.<ref name="Bloomberg">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-20/fox-agrees-to-sweetened-bid-from-disney-dealing-blow-to-comcast|title=Disney Sweetens Offer for Fox to $71 Billion, Outbidding Comcast|website=Bloomberg|last=Turner|first=Nick|date=June 20, 2018|access-date=June 20, 2018}}</ref> On June 27, the [[United States Department of Justice]] gave antitrust approval to Disney under the condition of selling Fox's 22 regional sports channels, to which the company has agreed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/27/us-set-to-give-antitrust-approval-for-disney-fox-deal.html|title=Disney wins US antitrust approval to buy Fox assets|work=CNBC|date=June 27, 2018|access-date=June 28, 2018}}</ref> On the next day, Disney and Fox shareholders scheduled July 27, 2018 as the day to vote on Fox's properties being sold to Disney, giving Comcast enough time to make a higher counter-offer for the Fox assets.<ref name="Vote-07-27-Variety">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/disney-fox-shareholder-voting-date-1202861184/|title=Disney, Fox Set Shareholder Voting Date for $71 Billion Deal|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 28, 2018|access-date=June 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Vote-07-27-LATimes">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-disney-fox-shareholders-vote-20180628-story.html|title=Disney and Fox schedule July 27 shareholder votes on merger — upping pressure on Comcast|last=James|first=Meg|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 28, 2018|access-date=June 28, 2018}}</ref>

However, on July 12, 2018, the Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal with the D.C. Circuit to reverse the District Court's approval for AT&T acquisition of Time Warner (now renamed WarnerMedia). Although analysts say that the chances of the DOJ win are small, they say it is the "final nail in the coffin for Comcast's Fox chase.

In 2004 and 2007, the [[American Customer Satisfaction Index]] (ACSI) survey found that Comcast had the worst customer satisfaction rating of any company or government agency in the country, including the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. The ACSI indicates that almost half of all cable customers (regardless of company) have registered complaints, and that cable is the only industry to score below 60 in the ACSI.<ref>[http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=90 The American Customer Satisfaction Index, ''First Quarter, 2004''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312061951/http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=90 |date=March 12, 2009 }}</ref> Comcast's Customer Service Rating by the ACSI surveys indicate that the company's customer service has not improved since the surveys began in 2001. Analysis of the surveys states that "Comcast is one of the lowest scoring companies in ACSI. As its customer satisfaction eroded by 7% over the past year, revenue increased by 12%." The ACSI analysis also addresses this contradiction, stating that "Such [[pricing power]] usually comes with some level of monopoly protection and most cable companies have little competition at the local level. This also means that a cable company can do well financially even though its customers are not particularly satisfied."<ref>[http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=169&Itemid=168 American Customer Satisfaction Index, ''First Quarter, 2007''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827175226/http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=169&Itemid=168 |date=August 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=149&Itemid=157&c=Comcast+Corporation&i=Cable+%26+Satellite+TV American Customer Satisfaction Index, ''Scores By Company: Comcast Corporation'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116182816/http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=149&Itemid=157&c=Comcast+Corporation&i=Cable+&+Satellite+TV |date=November 16, 2007 }}</ref>

Comcast was given an "F" for its corporate governance practices in 2010, by Corporate Library, an independent shareholder-research organization. According to Corporate Library, Comcast's board of directors ability to oversee and control management was severely compromised (at least in 2010) by the fact that several of the directors either worked for the company or had business ties to it (making them susceptible to management pressure), and a third of the directors were over 70 years of age. According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' nearly two thirds of the flights of Comcast's $40 million corporate jet purchased for business travel related to the NBCU acquisition, were to CEO Brian Roberts' private homes or to resorts.<ref name=Maremont>{{cite news

On August 1, 2016, Washington State Attorney General [[Bob Ferguson (politician)|Bob Ferguson]] filed a lawsuit against Comcast Corporation in King County Superior Court, alleging the company's own documents reveal a pattern of illegally deceiving their customers to pad their bottom line by tens of millions of dollars.<ref>Office of the Attorney General. [http://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-announces-lawsuit-against-comcast-more-100-million]. Retrieved August 1, 2016</ref> The FCC issued a $2.3 million fine to Comcast after finding that the company was charging customers for unordered services and equipment. More than a thousand customers issued complaints about these unprecedented charges to their bill. In addition, numerous customers reported inappropriate name-calling and interrogation by customer service representatives. Comcast's executive vice president, David Cohen, admitted the company needed to improve their customer service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/NewsDetailsPage/NewsDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=false&displayGroupName=News&currPage=&scanId=&query=&source=&prodId=BIC1&search_within_results=&p=BIC1&mode=view&catId=&u=sant38536&limiter=&display-query=&displayGroups=&contentModules=&action=e&sortBy=&documentId=GALE%7CA466395821&windowstate=normal&activityType=&failOverType=&|title=Gale - Product Login|website=ic.galegroup.com}}</ref>

On August 8, 2016 an official Comcast employee confirmed that Comcast was changing native 1080i channels to the 720p60 format. "Official Employees are from multiple teams within Comcast: Product, Support, Leadership."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.xfinity.com/t5/Non-X1-Service/1080i-channels-are-being-changed-to-720p60-channels/m-p/2783308#M183323|title=1080i channels are being changed to 720p channels|date=August 8, 2016}}</ref>

In February 2017, Comcast was ordered by the self-regulatory [[Advertising Self-Regulatory Council|National Advertising Review Board]] to cease using a claim based on [[Speedtest.net]] data that it has "America's fastest internet", stating that "Ookla's data showed only that Xfinity consumers who took advantage of the free tests offered on the Speedtest.net website subscribed to tiers of service with higher download speeds than Verizon FiOS consumers who took advantage of the tests." They were also ordered to stop using a claim that the company offers the "fastest in-home Wi-Fi," which was poorly substantiated.<ref name="ars-fastestnot">{{cite web|title=Not so fast—Comcast told to stop claiming it has "fastest Internet"|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/comcast-should-stop-claiming-it-has-fastest-internet-ad-board-rules/|website=Ars Technica|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref>
