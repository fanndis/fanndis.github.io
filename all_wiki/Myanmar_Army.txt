The '''Myanmar Army''' ({{lang-my|တပ်မတော်(ကြည်း)}}, {{IPA-my|taʔmədɔ̀  tɕí|pron}}) is the largest branch of the [[Tatmadaw|Armed Forces (''Tatmadaw'')]] of [[Myanmar]] (Burma) and has the primary responsibility of conducting land-based military operations. The Myanmar Army maintains the second largest active force in Southeast Asia after the [[People's Army of Vietnam]].
 
The Myanmar Army had a troop strength of around 350,000 as of 2006.<ref name=csisbalance>{{citation|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/060626_asia_balance_south.pdf|title=The Asian Conventional Military Balance 2006|publisher=[[Center for Strategic and International Studies]]|date=26 June 2006|page=4|access-date=20 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429184804/http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/060626_asia_balance_south.pdf|archive-date=29 April 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The army has extensive combat experience in fighting insurgents in rough terrains, considering it has been conducting non-stop [[counter-insurgency]] operations against ethnic and political insurgents since its inception in 1948.
 
The force is headed by the [[Commander-in-Chief of Myanmar Army]]({{my|ကာကွယ်ရေးဦးစီးချုပ်(ကြည်း)}}), currently Vice-Senior General Soe Win, concurrently Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Services, with Senior General [[Min Aung Hlaing]] as the [[Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services]] ({{my|တပ်မတော်ကာကွယ်ရေးဦးစီးချုပ်}}). The highest rank in the Myanmar Army is Senior General, equivalent to [[Field Marshal]] position in Western Armies and is currently held by Min Aung Hlaing after being promoted from Vice-Senior General.
 
In 2011, following transition from military junta government to civilian parliamentary government, the Myanmar Army enacted a military draft for all citizens; all males from the age 18 to 35 and all females age between 18 and 27 years of age can be drafted into military service for two years as enlisted personnel in time of national emergency. The ages for professionals are up to 45 for men and 35 for women for three years service as commissioned and non-commissioned officers.
 
An official publication has revealed that almost one-quarter of Myanmar's new national budget will be allocated to defence. The Government Gazette reports that 1.8&nbsp;trillion kyat (about $2&nbsp;billion at free market rates of exchange), or 23.6 percent of the 2011 budget will go to defence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LMDOSO1.htm|title=Myanmar allocates 1/4 of new budget to military|date=1 March 2011|agency=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=9 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628213807/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LMDOSO1.htm|archive-date=28 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Brief history==

=== British and Japanese rule ===
In the late 1930s, under the British rule, a few Myanmar organizations or parties formed an alliance named Burma's Htwet-Yet (Liberation) Group, one of them being [[Dobama Asiayone]]. Since most of the members were Communist, they wanted help from Chinese Communists; but when Tha-khin [[Aung San]] and a partner secretly went to China for help, they only met with a Japanese general and made an alliance with Japanese Army. In the early 1940's, Aung San and other 29 participants secretly went for the military training under Japanese Army and these 30 persons are later known as the 30 Soldiers in Myanmar history and can be regarded as the origin of modern Myanmar Army.

When Japanese Conquest of Burma was ready, the 30 Soldiers recruited Myanmar people in Thailand and founded Burmese Independence Army (BIA), which was the first phase of Myanmar Army. In 1942, BIA assisted Japanese Army in their conquest of Burma, which succeeded. After that, Japanese Army changed BIA to Burmese Defense Army (BDA), which was the second phase. In 1943, Japan officially declared Burma an independent nation, but the Burmese government did not possess the ''de facto'' rule over the country.

When assisting British Army in 1945, Myanmar Army was in its third phase, which was the Patriotic Burmese Force (PBF), and the country became under British rule again. Afterwards, the structure of the army became under British authority; hence, for those who were willing to serve the nation but not in that army, General Aung San organized People's Comrade.

=== Post-Independence era ===
[[File:Myanmar Army personnel at Naypyidaw reception.jpg|thumb|Myanmar Army Honour Guards saluting the arrival of the Thai delegation in October 2010]]
 
At the time of Myanmar's independence in 1948, the Tatmadaw was weak, small and disunited. Cracks appeared along the lines of ethnic background, political affiliation, organisational origin and different services. Its unity and operational efficiency was further weakened by the interference of civilians and politicians in military affairs, and the perception gap between the staff officers and field commanders. The most serious problem was the tension between ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] Officers, coming from the British Burma Army and [[Bamar]] officers, coming from the [[Patriotic Burmese Forces]] (PBF).{{cn|date=October 2020}}
 
In accordance with agreement reached at Kandy Conference in September 1945, the Tatmadaw was reorganised by incorporating the [[British Burma Army]] and the Patriotic Burmese Forces. The officer corps shared by ex-PBF officers and officers from British Burma Army and Army of Burma Reserve Organisation (ARBO). The British also decided to form what were known as "Class Battalions" based on ethnicity. There were a total of 15 rifle battalions at the time of independence and four of them were made up of former members of PBF.  All influential positions within the War Office and commands were manned with non-former PBF Officers. All services including military engineers, supply and transport, ordnance and medical services, Navy and Air Force were all commanded by former Officers from ABRO and British Burma Army.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

==Formation and structure==

The Army has always been by far the largest service in Myanmar and has always received the [[lion's share]] of the defence budget.<ref>Working Papers – Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, [[Australian National University]]</ref><ref name="Selth, Andrew 2002">Selth, Andrew (2002): ''Burma's Armed Forces: Power Without Glory'', Eastbridge. {{ISBN|1-891936-13-1}}</ref> It has played the most prominent part in Myanmar's struggle against the 40 or more insurgent groups since 1948 and acquired a reputation as a tough and resourceful military force. In 1981, it was described as 'probably the best army in Southeast Asia, apart from Vietnam's'.<ref>''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'', 20 May 1981</ref> The judgement was echoed in 1983, when another observer noted that "Myanmar's infantry is generally rated as one of the toughest, most combat seasoned in Southeast Asia".<ref>''[[Far Eastern Economic Review|FEER]]'', 7 July 1983</ref>
In 1985, a foreign journalist with the rare experience of seeing Burmese soldiers in action against ethnic insurgents and narco-armies was 'thoroughly impressed by their fighting skills, endurance and discipline'.<ref>[[Bertil Lintner]], ''Land of Jade''</ref> Other commentators throughout that time characterised the Myanmar Army as 'the toughest, most effective light infantry jungle force now operating in Southeast Asia'.<ref>''[[Asiaweek]]'' 21 February 1992</ref> Even the [[Thai people]], not known to praise the Burmese lightly, have described the Myanmar Army as 'skilled in the art of [[jungle warfare]]'.<ref>The Defence of Thailand (Thai Government issue), p.15, April 1995</ref>
 
===Organisation===

The Myanmar Army had reached some 370,000 active troops in all ranks in the year 2000. There were 337 [[infantry battalion]]s, including 266 [[light infantry]] battalions as of 2000. Although the Myanmar Army's organisational structure was based upon the [[Regiment|regimental system]], the basic manoeuvre and fighting unit is the [[battalion]], known as ''Tat Yinn'' ({{my|(တပ်ရင်း)}}) in Burmese.  This comprised a headquarters unit; five rifle companies ''Tat Khwe'' ({{my|(တပ်ခွဲ)}}) with three rifle platoons ''Tat Su'' ({{my|(တပ်စု)}}) each; an administration company with medical, transport, logistics and signals units; a heavy weapons company including [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], machine gun and [[recoilless gun]] platoons.  Each [[battalion]] is commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel ''Du Ti Ya Bo Hmu Gyi or Du Bo Hmu Gyi'' with a Major (''bo hmu'') as 2IC (Second in Command), with a total establishment strength of 27 officers and 723 other ranks. Light infantry battalions in the Myanmar Army have much lower establishment strength of around 500; this often leads to these units being mistakenly identified by the observers and reporters as under strength infantry battalions.
 
With its significantly increased personnel numbers, weaponry and mobility, today's ''Tatmadaw Kyee'' ({{my|တပ်မတော်(ကြည်း)}}) is a formidable conventional defence force for the Union of Myanmar.  Troops ready for combat duty have at least doubled since 1988.  Logistics infrastructure and [[Artillery]] Fire Support has been greatly increased.  Its newly acquired military might was apparent in the Tatmadaw's dry season operations against [[Karen National Union]] (KNU) strongholds in [[Manerplaw]] and Kawmura.  Most of the casualties at these battles were the result of intense and heavy bombardment by the Tatmadaw Kyee.  The Tatmadaw Kyee is now much larger than it was before 1988, it is more mobile and has greatly improved armour, artillery and air defence inventories.  Its C3I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) systems have been expanded and refined.  It is developing larger and more integrated, self-sustained formations to better coordinated action by different combat arms. The army may still have relatively modest weaponry compared to its larger neighbours, but it is now in a much better position to deter external aggression and respond to such a threat should it ever arise, although [[child soldiers]] may not perform very well in combating with enemies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html |title=Myanmar's losing military strategy |date=7 October 2006 |work=[[Asia Times]] |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513043428/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Expansion===
The first army [[division (military)|division]] to be formed after the 1988 military [[coup d'etat|coup]] was the 11th Light Infantry Division (LID) in December 1988 with [[Colonel]] Win Myint as commander of the division.  In March 1990, a new regional military command was opened in [[Monywa]] with [[Brigadier]] Kyaw Min as commander and named North-Western Regional Military Command.  A year later 101st LID was formed in [[Pakokku]] with Colonel Saw Tun as commander.  Two Regional Operations Commands (ROC) were formed in [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]] and [[Loikaw]] to facilitate command and control.  They were commanded respectively by Brigadier Soe Tint and Brigadier Maung Kyi.  March 1995 saw a dramatic expansion of the Tatmadaw as it established 11 Military Operations Commands (MOC)s in that month.  MOC are similar to [[Mechanised Infantry]] Divisions in western armies, each with 10 regular infantry battalions (''Chay Hlyin Tatyin''), a headquarters, and organic support units including [[field artillery]] batteries.  Then in 1996, two new RMC were opened, Coastal Region RMC was opened in Myeik with Brigadier Sit Maung as commander and Triangle Region RMC in [[Kengtung]] with Brigadier [[Thein Sein]] as commander.  Three new ROCs were opened in [[Kalay]], [[Bhamo]] and [[Mongsat]].  In late 1998, two new MOCs were opened in Bokepyin and Mongsat.<ref>WP 342. [[Australian National University]]</ref>
 
The most significant expansion after the infantry in the army was in armour and artillery. Beginning in 1990, the Tatmadaw procured 18 [[Type 59 tank|T-69II]] [[Main battle tank]]s and 48 [[PT-76|T-63]] amphibious [[light tank]]s from China.  Further procurements were made, including several hundred [[Type 85 AFV|Type 85]] and [[WZ551|Type 92]] [[Armoured personnel carrier]]s (APC).  By the beginning of 1998, Tatmadaw had about 100+ T-69II Main battle tanks, a similar number of T-63 amphibious light tanks and several T-59D tanks.  These tanks and armoured personnel carriers were distributed into five armoured infantry battalions and five tank battalions and formed the first Armoured Division of the Tatmadaw under the name of 71st Armoured Operations Command with its headquarters in Pyawbwe.
 
===Bureau of Special Operations (BSO)===
[[File:MM MOD New.svg|thumb|Bureau of Special Operations|150px]]
[[File:mm-rmc-map.jpg|thumb|Regional Military Commands (RMC)|200px]]
Bureau of Special Operations ({{my|ကာကွယ်ရေးဌာန စစ်ဆင်ရေး အထူးအဖွဲ့}}) in Myanmar Army are high-level field units equivalent to [[Field Army]] in Western terms and consist of 2 or more Regional Military Commands (RMC) and commanded by a lieutenant-general and 6 staff officers.
 
The units were introduced under the [[General Staff|General Staff Office]] on 28 April 1978 and 1 June 1979. In early 1978, the then Chairman of BSPP General Ne Win visited the North Eastern Command Headquarters in Lashio to receive a briefing about [[Burmese Communist Party]] (BCP) [[insurgents]] and their [[military operations]].  He was accompanied by Brigadier General Tun Ye from Ministry of Defence. Brigadier General Tun Ye was the regional commander of Eastern Command for three years and before that he served in North Eastern Command areas as commander of Strategic Operation Command (SOC) and commander for Light Infantry Division for four years.  As BCP military operations were spread across three Regional Military Command (RMC) areas (Northern, Eastern and North Eastern), Brigadier General Tun Ye was the most informed commander about the BCP in Myanmar Army at the time.  At the briefing, General Ne Win was impressed by Brigadier General Tun Ye and realised that co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC) was necessary; thus, decided to form a bureau at the Ministry of Defence.
 
Originally, the bureau was for "special operations", wherever they were, that needed co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC).  Later, with introduction of another bureau, there was a division of command areas.  The BSO-1 was to oversee the operations under the Northern Command, North Eastern Command, the Eastern Command, and the North Western Command.  BSO-2 was to oversee operations under the South Eastern Command, South Western Command, Western Command and Central Command.
 
Initially, the chief of the BSO had the rank of brigadier general.  The rank was upgraded to major general on 23 April 1979.  in 1990, it was further upgraded to lieutenant general.  Between 1995 and 2002, Chief of Staff (Army) jointly held the position of Chief of BSO.  However, in early 2002, two more BSO were added to the General Staff Office; therefore there were altogether four BSOs.  The fifth BSO was established in 2005 and the sixth in 2007.
 
Currently there are Six Bureaus of Special Operations in Myanmar order of Battle.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

===Regional Military Commands (RMC)===

For better command and communication, the Tatmadaw formed Regional Military Commands ({{my|တိုင်း စစ်ဌာနချုပ်}}) structure in 1958. Until 1961, there were only two regional commands, they were supported by 13 Infantry brigades and an infantry division. In October 1961, new regional military commands were opened and leaving only two independent infantry brigades. In June 1963, the Naypyidaw Command was temporarily formed in [[Yangon]] with the deputy commander and some staff officers drawn from Central Command.  It was reorganised and renamed as Yangon Command on 1 June 1965.{{cn|date=October 2020}}
 
A total of 337 infantry and light infantry battalions organised in Tactical Operations Commands, 37 independent field artillery regiments supported by affiliated support units including armoured [[reconnaissance]] and [[tank]] battalions. RMCs are similar to [[corps]] formations in Western armies. The RMCs, commanded by major general rank officer, are managed through a framework of Bureau of Special Operations (BSOs), which are equivalent to [[Field Army|Field Army Group]] in Western terms.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

===Regional Operations Commands (ROC)===
Regional Operations Commands (ROC)({{my|ဒေသကွပ်ကဲမှု စစ်ဌာနချုပ်}}) are commanded by a brigadier general, are similar to infantry brigades in Western Armies. Each consists of 4 Infantry battalions (Chay Hlyin Tatyin), HQ and organic support units.  Commander of ROC is a position between LID/MOC commander and tactical Operation Command (TOC) commander, who commands three infantry battalions.  The ROC commander holds financial, administrative and judicial authority while the MOC and LID commanders do not have judicial authority.<ref name="Selth, Andrew 2002"/><ref name="Myoe, Maung Aung">Myoe, Maung Aung: ''Building the tatmadaw – Myanmar Armed Forces Since 1948'', Institute of SouthEast Asian Studies. {{ISBN|978-981-230-848-1}}</ref>

===Military Operations Commands (MOC)===

Military Operations Commands (MOC) (စစ်ဆင်ရေးကွပ်ကဲမှုဌာနချုပ်), commanded by a brigadier-general are similar to Infantry Divisions in Western Armies. Each consists of 10 Mechanised Infantry battalions equipped with [[BTR-3]] armoured personnel carriers, Headquarters and support units including field artillery batteries.  These ten battalions are organised into three Tactical Operations Commands: one Mechanised Tactical Operations Command with BTR-3 armoured personnel carriers, and two Motorized Tactical Operations Command with [[EQ-2102]] 6x6 trucks.
 
MOC are equivalent to Light Infantry Divisions (LID) in the Myanmar Army order of battle as both command 10 infantry battalions through three TOC's (Tactical Operations Commands).  However, unlike Light Infantry Divisions, MOC are subordinate to their respective Regional Military Command (RMC) Headquarters.<ref name="Myoe, Maung Aung"/> Members of MOC does not wear distinguished arm insignias and instead uses their respective RMC's arm insignias.  For example, MOC-20 in [[Kawthaung]] wore the arm insignia of Costal Region Military Command.

===Light Infantry Divisions (LID)===
Light Infantry Division (''Chay Myan Tat Ma'' or ''Ta Ma Kha''), commanded by a brigadier general, each with 10 Light Infantry Battalions organised under 3 Tactical Operations Commands, commanded by a Colonel, (''3 battalions each and 1 reserve''), 1 Field Artillery Battalion, 1 Armour Squadron and other support units.<ref name="Selth, Andrew 2002"/><ref name="Myoe, Maung Aung"/>
 
These divisions were first introduced to the Myanmar Army in 1966 as rapid reaction mobile forces for strike operations. 77th Light Infantry Division was formed on 6 June 1966, followed by 88th Light Infantry Division and 99th Light Infantry Division in the two following years. 77th LID was largely responsible for the defeat of the Communist forces of the CPB ([[Communist Party of Burma]]) based in the forested hills of the central [[Bago, Burma|Bago]] Mountains in the mid-1970s. Three more LIDs were raised in the latter half of the 1970s (the 66th, 55th and 44th) with their headquarters at [[Pyay]], [[Aungban]] and [[Thaton]]. They were followed by another two LIDs in the period prior to the 1988 military coup (the 33rd LID with headquarters at [[Sagaing]] and the 22nd LID with headquarters at [[Hpa-An]]). 11th LID was formed in December 1988 with headquarters at [[Inndine]], [[Bago Division]] and 101st LID was formed in 1991 with its headquarters at [[Pakokku]].<ref name="Selth, Andrew 2002" /><ref name="Myoe, Maung Aung" />
 
Each LID, commanded by Brigadier General (''Bo hmu gyoke'') level officers, consists of 10 light infantry battalions specially trained in [[counter-insurgency]], [[jungle warfare]], "search and destroy" operations against ethnic insurgents and narcotics-based armies. These battalions are organised under three Tactical Operations Commands (TOC; ''Nee byu har'').  Each TOC, commanded by a Colonel (''Bo hmu gyi''), is made up of three or more combat battalions, with command and support elements similar to that of brigades in Western armies. One infantry battalion is held in reserve.  As of 2000, all LIDs have their own organic Field Artillery units.  For example, 314th Field Artillery Battery is now attached to 44th LID.  Some of the LID battalions have been given Parachute and Air Borne Operations training and two of the LIDs have been converted to mechanised infantry formation with divisional artillery, armoured reconnaissance and tank battalions<ref name="Selth, Andrew 2002" />
 
LIDs are considered to be a strategic asset of the Myanmar Army, and after the 1990 reorganisation and restructuring of the Tatmadaw command structure, they are now directly answerable to Chief of Staff (Army).<ref name="Selth, Andrew 2002"/><ref name="Myoe, Maung Aung"/>

===Missile, Artillery and armoured units===

Missile, Artillery and armoured units were not used in an independent role, but were deployed in support of the infantry by the Ministry of Defence as required. The Directorate of Artillery and Armour Corps was also divided into separate corps in 2001. The Directorate of Artillery and Missile Corps was also divided into separate corps in 2009. A dramatic expansion of forces under these directorates followed with the equipment procured from China, Russia, [[Ukraine]] and [[India]].<ref name="Selth, Andrew 2002"/>

[[File:mm-artillery-flag.jpg|thumb|707th Artillery Operation Command|150px]]
No. 1 Artillery Battalion was formed in 1952 with three artillery batteries under the Directorate of Artillery Corps.  A further three artillery battalions were formed in the late 1952.  This formation remained unchanged until 1988.  Since 2000, the Directorate of Artillery Corps has overseen the expansion of Artillery Operations Commands(AOC) from two to 10. [[Tatmadaw]]'s stated intention is to establish an organic Artillery Operations Command in each of the 12 Regional Military Command Headquarters. Each Artillery Operation Command is composed of the following:{{cn|date=October 2020}}
 
As of 2000, the Artillery wing of the Tatmadaw has about 60 battalions and 37 independent Artillery companies/batteries attached to various Regional Military Commands (RMC), Light Infantry Divisions (LID), Military Operation Command (MOC) and Regional Operation Command (ROC).  For example, 314th Artillery Battery is under 44th LID, 326 Artillery Battery is attached to 5th MOC, 074 Artillery Battery is under the command of ROC (Bhamo) and 076 Artillery Battery is under North-Eastern RMC.  Twenty of these Artillery battalions are grouped under 707th Artillery Operation Command (AOC) headquarters in [[Kyaukpadaung]] and 808th Artillery Operation Command (AOC) headquarters in Oaktwin, near [[Taungoo]].  The remaining 30 battalions, including 7 Anti-Aircraft artillery battalions are under the Directorate of Artillery Corps.<ref name="Selth, Andrew 2002"/>

===Directorate of Armour===

No. 1 Armour Company and No. 2 Armour Company were formed in July 1950 under the Directorate of Armour and Artillery Corps with [[Sherman tank]]s, [[Stuart light tank]]s, [[Humber Scout Car]]s, [[Ferret armoured car]]s and [[Bren Carrier|Universal Bren Carriers]].  These two companies were merged on 1 November 1950 to become No. 1 Armour Battalion with headquarters in Mingalardon.  On 15 May 1952 No. Tank Battalion was formed with 25 [[Comet tank]]s acquired from the United Kingdom.  The Armour Corps within Myanmar Army was the most neglected one for nearly thirty years since the Tatmadaw had not procured any new tanks or armoured carriers since 1961.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
 
Armoured divisions, known as Armoured Operations Command (AROC), under the command of Directorate of Armour Corps, were also expanded in number from one to two, each with four Armoured Combat battalions equipped with [[Infantry fighting vehicle]]s and armoured personnel carriers, three tank battalions equipped with main battle tanks and three Tank battalions equipped with light tanks.
<ref name="Myoe, Maung Aung"/> In mid-2003, Tamadaw acquired 139+ [[T-72]] [[main battle tank]]s from Ukraine and signed a contract to build and equip a factory in Myanmar to produce and assemble 1,000 [[BTR (vehicle)|BTR]] armoured personnel carriers in 2004.<ref name="irrawaddy.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=954 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605143420/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=954 |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  In 2006, the [[Government of India]] transferred an unspecified number of [[T-55]] main battle tanks that were being phased out from active service to Tatmadaw along with 105&nbsp;mm light field guns, armoured personnel carriers and indigenous [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter]]s in return for Tatmadaw's support and co-operation in flushing out Indian insurgent groups operating from its soil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.india-defence.com/reports-2576|title=Defense19|accessdate=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034257/http://www.india-defence.com/reports-2576|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
 
====Armoured Operations Command (AROC)====

Armoured Operations Commands (AROC) are equivalent to Independent armoured divisions in western terms. Currently there are 5 Armoured Operations Commands under Directorate of Armoured Corps in the Tatmadaw order of battle. Tatmadaw planned to establish an AROC each in 7 Regional Military Commands.{{cn|date=October 2020}} Typical armoured divisions in the Myanmar Army are composed of Headquarters, Three Armored Tactical Operations Command – each with one mechanised infantry battalion equipped with 44 [[BMP-1]] or MAV-1 Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Two Tank Battalions equipped with 44 main battle tanks each, one armoured reconnaissance battalion equipped with 32 Type-63A Amphibious Light Tanks, one field artillery battalion and a support battalion. The support battalion is composed of an [[Military engineering|engineer]] [[squadron (army)|squadron]], two logistic squadrons, and a signal company.{{cn|date=October 2020}}
 
The Myanmar Army acquired about 150 refurbished [[EE-9 Cascavel]] [[armored car (military)|armoured cars]] from an Israeli firm in 2005.<ref name="Rus">{{cite web|url=http://www.badasf.org/2007/WhyRussia.htm |title=Why Russia |accessdate=12 March 2015 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205081403/http://www.badasf.org/2007/WhyRussia.htm |archivedate=5 December 2014 }}</ref> Classified in the army's service as a light tank, the Cascavel is currently deployed in the eastern Shan State and triangle regions near the Thai border.

===Bureau of Air Defence===
The Air Defence Command was formed during the late 1990s but was not fully operational until late 1999. It was renamed Bureau of Air Defence in the early 2000s (decade). In early 2000, Tatmadaw established Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System (MIADS) with help from Russia, [[Ukraine]] and China. It is a tri-service bureau with units from all three branches of Myanmar Armed Forces. All Air Defence assets except [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] within Tatmadaw arsenal are integrated into MIADS. AAA guns are mostly unguided and deploy to use in barrage-style firing against attacking aircraft. MIADS is directly answerable to Bureau of Air Defence under Ministry of Defence.{{cn|date=October 2020}}
 
In 2010, Myanmar Air Defence Command completed installation of an optical fibre communication network throughout the country. The network is to be used for air defence operations between Central Command HQ from capital and several air bases, early warning radar stations and mobile anti-aircraft missile and artillery units. After completion of the fibre optic project and radar stations, MIADS (Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System) is the most advance AD system in the region.

====Sector Operations Commands====
Under MIADS, the country was divided into six Air Defence Sectors, each controlled by a Sector Operations Center (SOC) and reporting directly to the National Air Defence Operations Centre (ADOC) in Yangon. Each SOC transmitted data back to Intercept Operations Centers (IOC), which in turn controlled [[surface-to-air missile]] batteries and [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]/[[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] squadrons at various Air Bases. Each IOC was optimised to direct either SAMs or fighter/interceptor aircraft against incoming enemy aircraft or missile. Each IOC was connected to observer and early warning area reporting posts (RP) via military owned underground fibre optic cable network. There were about 100 [[radar|radar stations]] located at approximately 40 sites throughout the country. New Air Defence radars such as 1L117 radars, Galaxy Early Warning Radar and P series radars are installed in all radar stations.{{cn|date=October 2020}}
 
Each Sector Operation Center (SOC) is commanded by a major general and it consists of one air defence division from Myanmar Army and one fighter-interceptor wing from [[Myanmar Air Force]]. Sometimes Air Defence [[Frigate]]s from Myanmar Navy also operate under the direct command of respective SOC.
 
Each Air Defence division is commanded by a brigadier general and consists of three Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (TOC) and support units. One Medium Range Surface to Air Missile Tactical Operations Command (MRSAM-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Buk missile system|Buk M-1]] or [[2K12 Kub|Kub]] missile system is deployed in an Area Defence Belt role. One Short Range Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (SHORAD-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Tor M-1]] missile system is deployed in a Point Defence role for critical areas such as radar stations, fighter bases and SOC headquarters. One Electronic Reconnaissance Tactical Operations Command (EIR-TOC) with 6 to 8 radar and communication companies for early warnings and interdiction detection.
 
Each fighter-interceptor wing commanded by a [[brigadier general]] and is composed of three Fighter squadrons of either [[MiG-29]] and [[Chengdu J-7|F-7M Airguard]] Interceptors (ten aircraft per squadron) and their ground base support units.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

=== Directorate of Signal ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mm-signal.jpg|thumb|Directorate of Signal|150px]] -->
Soon after the independence in 1948, Myanmar Signal Corps was formed with units from Burma Signals, also known as "X" Branch.  It consisted HQ Burma Signals, Burma Signal Training Squadron (BSTS) and Burma Signals Squadron.  HQ Burma Signals was located within War Office.  BSTS based in Pyain Oo Lwin was formed with Operating Cipher Training Troop, Dispacth Rider Training Troop, Lineman Training Troop, Radio Mechanic Training Troop and Regimental Signals Training Troop.  BSS, based in Mingalardon, had nince sections: Administration Troop, Maintenance Troop, Operating Troop, Cipher Troop, Lineman and Dispatch Rider Troop, NBSD Signals Troop, SBSD Signals Troop, Mobile Brigade Signals Toop and Arakan Signals Toop.  The then Chief of Signal Staff Officer (CSO) was Lieutenant Colonel Saw Aung Din.  BSTS and BSS were later renamed No. 1 Signal Battalion and No.1 Signal Training Battalion.  In 1952, the Infantry Divisional Signals Regiment was formed and later renamed to No. 2 Signal Battalion.  HQ Burma Signals was reorganised and became Directorate Signal and the director was elevated to the rank of Colonel.  In 1956, No. 1 Signal Security Battalion was formed, followed by No. 3 Signal Battalion in November 1958 and No.4 Signal Battalion in October 1959.
 
In 1961, signal battalions were reorganised as No. 11 Signal Battalion under North Eastern Regional Military Command, No. 121 Signal Battalion under Eastern Command, No. 313 Signal Battalion under Central Command, No.414 Signal Battalion under South Western Command, and No. 515 Signal Battalion under South Eastern Command.  No.1 Signal Training Battalion was renamed Burma Signal Training Depot (Baho-Setthweye-Tat).
 
By 1988, Directorate of Signals command one training depot, eight signal battalions, one signal security battalion, one signal store depot and two signal workshops.  Signal Corps under Directorate of Signal further expanded during 1990 expansion and reorganisation of Myanmar Armed Forces.  By 2000, a signal battalion is attached to each Regional Military Command and signal companies are now attached to Light Infantry Divisions and Military Operations Commands.
 
In 2000, [[C4ISTAR|Command, Control and Communication]] system of Myanmar Army has been substantially upgraded by setting up the military [[fibre optic]] communication network managed by Directorate of Signal throughout the country. Since 2002 all Myanmar Army Regional Military Command HQs used its own telecommunication system. [[Satellite communication|Satellite communication links]] are also provided to forward-deployed infantry battalions. However, battle field communication systems are still poor. Infantry units are still using TRA 906 and PRM 4051 which were acquired from UK in the 1980s. Myanmar Army also uses the locally built TRA 906 Thura and Chinese XD-D6M radio sets. Frequency hopping handsets are fitted to all front line units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/08/13/jane%E2%80%99s-intelligence-review-radio-active-%E2%80%93-desmond-ball-and-samuel-blythe/|title=Burmanet " Jane's Intelligence Review: Radio active – Desmond Ball and Samuel Blythe|accessdate=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206031853/http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/08/13/jane%E2%80%99s-intelligence-review-radio-active-%E2%80%93-desmond-ball-and-samuel-blythe/|archive-date=6 December 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
 
Between 2000 and 2005, Myanmar army bought 50 units of Brett 2050 Advanced Tech radio set from Aussie through third party from Singapore. Those units are distributed to ROCs in central & upper regions to use in counterinsurgency operations.<ref name="Myoe, Maung Aung"/>
 
===Directorate of Medical Services===
{{Main|Directorate of Medical Services}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mm-armymedical.jpg|thumb|Directorate of Army Medical Services|150px]] -->
At the time of independence in 1948, the medical corps has two Base Military Hospitals, each with 300 beds, in Mingalardon and Pyin Oo Lwin, a Medical Store Depot in Yangon, a Dental Unit and six Camp Reception Stations located in Myitkyina, Sittwe, Taungoo, Pyinmana, Bago and Meikhtila.

===Non-commissioned officers===

[[Non-commissioned officer]]s  (NCOs) are referred to as Saya (ဆရာ), meaning "teacher", by both [[enlisted men]] and officers. [[Warrant Officer (United Kingdom)|Regiment Sergeant Major]], [[Company Sergeant Major]]s are bo lay(ဗိုလ်လေး) escThis [[Master Sergeant]]/ [[Sergeant]] are referred to as Sayagyi (ဆရာကြီး), literally meaning "Old Teacher", are referred to as Saya and [[Corporal]]/[[Lance Corporal]] as Sayalay (ဆရာလေး). These unofficial ranks are used throughout the daily life of all branches. Non-commissioned officers (NCO) within the Myanmar Armed Forces are usually seasoned veteran soldiers. Thus both Officers and enlisted men refer to them as "teacher" out of respect.
