'''Samuel Moore Walton''' (March 29, 1918 – April 5, 1992)
was an American businessman and entrepreneur best known for founding the retailers [[Walmart]] and [[Sam's Club]]. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. grew to be the world's largest corporation by revenue as well as the biggest private employer in the world.<ref name="rediff">{{cite web | title = Sam Walton Biography | url = https://www.7infi.com/sam-walton-biography-age-weight-height-friend-like-affairs-favourite-birthdate-other/ | work = 7infi.com|access-date=August 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810171106/https://www.7infi.com/sam-walton-biography-age-weight-height-friend-like-affairs-favourite-birthdate-other/|archive-date=August 10, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For a period of time, Walton was the richest man in America.

==Early life==
Samuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in [[Kingfisher, Oklahoma]]. He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother's Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for [[Metropolitan Life]] Insurance,<ref>{{cite book | last = Walton | first = Sam | title = Sam Walton: Made in America | publisher = Random House Publishing Group | isbn = 978-0-345-53844-4 | page = 4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Lee | first = Sally | title = Sam Walton: Business Genius of Wal-Mart | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H04Warg9u3cC&q=farming+Sam+Walton+father+mortgage&pg=PA13 | accessdate = December 30, 2012 | year = 2007 | publisher = Enslow Publishers, Inc. | isbn = 978-0766026926 | page = 13}}</ref> where he [[foreclosure|foreclosed]] on farms during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Landrum | first = Gene N. | title = Entrepreneurial Genius: The Power of Passion | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fRdwUrLj2rgC&q=farming+Sam+Walton+father+mortgage&pg=PA120 | accessdate = December 30, 2012 | year = 2004 | publisher = Brendan Kelly Publishing  | isbn = 1895997232 | page = 120}}</ref>

He and his family (now with another son, [[James "Bud" Walton|James]], born in 1921) moved from [[Oklahoma]]. They moved from one small town to another for several years, mostly in Missouri. While attending eighth grade in [[Shelbina, Missouri]], Sam became the youngest [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in the state's history.<ref name="honor">{{cite book | last = Townley | first = Alvin | url = http://www.thomasdunnebooks.com/TD_TitleDetail.aspx?ISBN=0312366531 | title = Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts | publisher = St. Martin's Press | location = Asia | pages = 88–89 | isbn = 0-312-36653-1 | accessdate = December 29, 2006 | date = December 26, 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061219180428/http://www.thomasdunnebooks.com/TD_TitleDetail.aspx?ISBN=0312366531 | archive-date = December 19, 2006 | url-status = live }}</ref> In adult life, Walton became a recipient of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] from the [[Boy Scouts of America]].<ref name="deshnikjiniuhgyalistt">{{cite web | url = http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/02-529.pdf | title = Distinguished Eagle Scouts | publisher = Scouting.org | accessdate = November 4, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160312002744/http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/02-529.pdf | archive-date = March 12, 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Eventually the family moved to [[Columbia, Missouri]]. Growing up during the Great Depression, he did chores to help make financial ends meet for his family as was common at the time. He milked the family cow, bottled the surplus, and drove it to customers. Afterwards, he would deliver ''[[Columbia Daily Tribune]]'' newspapers on a paper route. In addition, he sold magazine subscriptions.<ref name="Forbes269">{{cite book | first1 = Daniel | last1 = Gross | author2 = [[Forbes|''Forbes'' Magazine]] Staff | date = August 1997 | title = Greatest Business Stories of All Time | edition = First | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]]f | location = New York | isbn = 0-471-19653-3 | page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_0471196533/page/269 269] | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_0471196533/page/269 | access-date = December 18, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200610115619/https://archive.org/details/isbn_0471196533/page/269 | archive-date = June 10, 2020 | url-status = live }}</ref> Upon graduating from [[David H. Hickman High School]] in Columbia, he was voted "Most Versatile Boy".
[[File:SamWalton-1936.jpg|thumb|Sam Walton in his high school yearbook]]
After high school, Walton decided to attend college, hoping to find a better way to help support his family. He attended the [[University of Missouri]] as an [[ROTC]] cadet. During this time, he worked various odd jobs, including waiting tables in exchange for meals. Also during his time in college, Walton joined the [[Zeta Phi]] chapter of [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity. He was also tapped by [[QEBH]], the well-known secret society on campus honoring the top senior men, and the national military honor society [[Scabbard and Blade]]. Additionally, Walton served as president of Burall Bible Class, a large class of students from the University of Missouri and [[Stephens College]].<ref>{{ cite book | last=Walton | first=Sam | title=Sam Walton: Made in America |publisher=Random House Publishing Group| isbn=978-0-345-53844-4 | page=15}}</ref> Upon graduating in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in economics, he was voted "permanent president" of the class.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite journal | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/635176/Sam-Walton | title = Sam Walton | journal = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica Inc | year = 2012 | accessdate = March 30, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131021202035/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/635176/Sam-Walton | archive-date = October 21, 2013 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Furthermore, he elaborated that he learned from a very early age that it was important for them as kids to help provide for the home, to be givers rather than takers. Walton realized while serving in the army, that he wanted to go into retailing and to go into business for himself.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Sam Walton, Made in America: My Story | last = Walton | first = Sam | publisher = Doubleday| year = 1992 | pages = 5, 15, and 20}}</ref>

Walton joined [[J. C. Penney]] as a management trainee in [[Des Moines, Iowa]],<ref name="Britannica"/> three days after graduating from college.<ref name="Forbes269"/> This position paid him $75 a month. Walton spent approximately 18 months with J. C. Penney.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Walton | first=Sam | title=Sam Walton: Made in America |publisher=Random House Publishing Group| isbn=978-0-345-53844-4 | page=18}}</ref> He resigned in 1942 in anticipation of being inducted into the military for service in [[World War II]].<ref name="Forbes269"/> In the meantime, he worked at a [[DuPont]] munitions plant near [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. Soon afterwards, Walton joined the military in the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Intelligence Corps]], supervising security at aircraft plants and [[prisoner-of-war camp|prisoner of war camps]]. In this position he served at [[Fort Douglas, Utah|Fort Douglas]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. He eventually reached the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]].

==The first stores==
In 1945, after leaving the military, Walton took over management of his first variety store at the age of 26.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-06-04|title=Lessons from Sam Walton: How a social-local strategy brings the human touch back to business|url=https://hearsaysystems.com/2012/06/lessons-from-sam-walton/|access-date=2020-12-05|website=Hearsay Systems|language=en-US}}</ref> With the help of a $20,000 loan from his father-in-law, plus $5,000 he had saved from his time in the Army, Walton purchased a [[Ben Franklin (company)|Ben Franklin]] variety store in [[Newport, Arkansas]].<ref name="Forbes269"/> The store was a franchise of the [[Butler Brothers]] chain.

Walton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success. According to Walton, if he offered prices as good or better than stores in cities that were four hours away by car, people would shop at home.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book | title = WAL-MART | last = Sandra S. Vance | first = Roy V. Scott | publisher = TWAYNE PUBLISHERS | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-8057-9833-1 | location = New York | pages = 41}}</ref> Walton made sure the shelves were consistently stocked with a wide range of goods. His second store, the tiny "Eagle" department store, was down the street from his first Ben Franklin and next door to its main competitor in Newport.

With the sales volume growing from $80,000 to $225,000 in three years, Walton drew the attention of the landlord, P. K. Holmes, whose family had a history in retail.<ref name="ArkEncyclo">{{cite web | url = http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1792 | title = Sam Walton | publisher = Butler Center for Arkansas Studies | accessdate = March 30, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120418173821/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1792 | archive-date = April 18, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref>
Admiring Sam's great success, and desiring to reclaim the store (and franchise rights) for his son he refused to renew the lease. The lack of a renewal option, together with the prohibitively high rent of 5% of sales, were early business lessons to Walton. Despite forcing Walton out, Holmes bought the store's inventory and fixtures for $50,000, which Walton called "a fair price".<ref>Walton & Huey, ''Made in America: My Story'', p. 30.</ref>

[[File:Walton's Five and Dime store, Bentonville, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|left|Walton's Five and Dime, now the Walmart Visitors Center, Bentonville.]]
With a year left on the lease, but the store effectively sold, he, his wife Helen and his father-in-law managed to negotiate the purchase of a new location on the downtown square of [[Bentonville, Arkansas]]. Walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store, and the title to the building, on the condition that he get a 99-year lease to expand into the shop next door. The owner of the shop next door refused six times, and Walton gave up on Bentonville when his father-in-law, without Sam's knowledge, paid the shop owner a final visit and $20,000 to secure the lease. He had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal, and reimburse Helen's father. They opened for business with a one-day remodeling sale on May 9, 1950.<ref name="ArkEncyclo"/>

Before he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wenz | first = Peter S. | author-link = Peter Wenz | title = Take Back the Center: Progressive Taxation for a New Progressive Agenda | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDPuSs2c27cC&q=Sam+Walton+Bentonville+%2472%2C000&pg=PA60 | accessdate = December 30, 2012 | year = 2012 | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | isbn = 978-0262017886 | page = 60}}</ref>

==A chain of Ben Franklin stores==
With the new Bentonville "Five and Dime" opening for business, and 220 miles away, a year left on the lease in Newport, the money-strapped young Walton had to learn to delegate responsibility.<ref name="WaltonHuey">{{cite book | title = Made in America: My Story | last1 = Walton | first1 = Sam | author2 = John Huey | year = 1992 | publisher = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] | location = New York | isbn = 0-385-42615-1 | url = https://archive.org/details/samwaltonmadeina00walt}}</ref><ref name="Trimble">{{cite book | title = Sam Walton: the Inside Story of America's Richest Man | first1 = Vance H. | last1 = Trimble | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-451-17161-6}} {{ISBN|978-0-451-17161-0}}</ref>

After succeeding with two stores at such a distance (and with the [[Post–World War II baby boom|postwar baby boom]] in full effect), Sam became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more [[Ben Franklin (company)|Ben Franklin franchises]]. (Also, having spent countless hours behind the wheel, and with his close brother [[James "Bud" Walton]] having been a pilot in the war, he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane. Both he and his son [[John T. Walton|John]] would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.)<ref name="WaltonHuey"/>

In 1954, he opened a store with his brother [[James "Bud" Walton|Bud]] in a shopping center in Ruskin Heights, a suburb of [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. With the help of his brother and father-in-law, Sam went on to open many new variety stores. He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet to open. (This motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise.)<ref name="WaltonHuey"/> By 1962, along with his brother Bud, he owned 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas (fifteen Ben Franklin's and one independent, in Fayetteville).<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/ben-franklin-store-a-throwback-to-the-five-and-dime/article_929768ec-f930-11e1-a9aa-0019bb30f31a.html | title = Ben Franklin store, a throwback to the five-and-dime, finally closes | author = Kavita Kumar | work = [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | date = September 8, 2012 | access-date = July 26, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140830120803/http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/ben-franklin-store-a-throwback-to-the-five-and-dime/article_929768ec-f930-11e1-a9aa-0019bb30f31a.html | archive-date = August 30, 2014 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Sam Walton is regarded as one of the greatest project entrepreneurs in the retail chain industry. He had a great passion for learning. He frequently made unannounced visits to Walmarts around the country to learn what local innovations were working that then could be shared with other Walmarts. On one of those visits he was puzzled by a greeter saying “hello” at the entrance of the store and asked the fellow what he was doing. The greeter explained that his main job was to discourage shoplifters from taking unpaid merchandise out of the store through the entrance. Walton was delighted and shared the innovation with “associates” throughout his chain.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Openness to Creative Destruction- Sustaining Innovative Dynamism | last = Diamond | first = Arthur M. | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2019 | location = USA & UK | pages = 25}}</ref>

==First Walmart==
{{Main|History of Walmart}}

The first true [[Walmart]] opened on July 2, 1962, in [[Rogers, Arkansas]].<ref name="Forbes272">{{cite book | first1 = Daniel | last1 = Gross | author2 = [[Forbes|''Forbes'' Magazine]] Staff | date = August 1997 | title = Greatest Business Stories of All Time | edition = First | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]], Inc | location = New York | isbn = 0-471-19653-3 | page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_0471196533/page/272 272] | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_0471196533/page/272 }}</ref> Called the Wal-Mart Discount City store, it was located at 719 West Walnut Street. He launched a determined effort to market American-made products. Included in the effort was a willingness to find American manufacturers who could supply merchandise for the entire Walmart chain at a price low enough to meet the foreign competition.<ref name="Made In America">{{cite web | date = December 26, 2006 | url = http://www.anbhf.org/laureates/swalton.html | title = Sam Walton: Walmart Corporation | author1 = Yohannan T.

As the [[Meijer]] store chain grew, it caught the attention of Walton. He came to acknowledge that his one-stop-shopping center format was based on Meijer’s original innovative concept.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/11/west_michigan_grocery_magnate.html | title = Fred Meijer, West Michigan billionaire grocery magnate, dies at 91 | work = MLive.com | date = November 26, 2011 | access-date = November 26, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180410072436/http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/11/west_michigan_grocery_magnate.html | archive-date = April 10, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref>
Contrary to the prevailing practice of American discount store chains, Walton located stores in smaller towns, not larger cities. To be near consumers, the only option at the time was to open outlets in small towns. Walton's model offered two advantages. First, existing competition was limited and secondly, if a store was large enough to control business in a town and its surrounding areas, other merchants would be discouraged from entering the market.<ref name=":0" />

To make his model work, he emphasized [[logistics]], particularly locating stores within a day's drive of Walmart's regional warehouses, and distributed through its own trucking service. Buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise. Thus, sustained growth{{mdash}} from 1977's 190 stores to 1985's 800{{mdash}} was achieved.<ref name="Britannica" />

Walmart is a privately controlled economic institution and has both positive and negative impact everywhere it establishes a store and creates the so called "Walmart Effect". <ref name="The Walmart Effect">{{cite book | first = Charles | last = Fishman |date = 2006 | title = How The World's Most Powerful Company Really Works-and How It's Transforming the American Economy. | publisher = [[The Penguin Press]], Inc | location = New York}}</ref>
