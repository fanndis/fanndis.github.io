== Early life and background ==
Tímea Babos was born on 10 May 1993 by mother Zsuzsanna and father Csaba in [[Sopron]], Hungary. She also has older sister named Susie.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Timea Babos Bio|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/players/317070/timea-babos/bio|access-date=November 20, 2020|website=WTA Tennis}}</ref> Coming from sporty family, Babos decided to follow her family steps.  Her father is a coach at the tennis club her family owns in Sopron, while her mother is a housewife. Her sister was also a very good player and won NCAA titles when studying at Berkley in the United States.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|date=December 4, 2012|title=WTA: getting to knom…Tímea Babos|url=https://babostimea.hu/en/wta-getting-to-knomtimea-babos/|access-date=November 20, 2020|website=babostimea.hu}}</ref> She was originally a swimmer and was National Champion in Hungary, but during the time she looked at the swimming differently, finding it quite boring and as hard work, so she started to come with her sister to tennis practice at the age of 8. Originally she started playing tennis just for fun, but then her dad saw her talent, so she started to concentrate more on it and eventually stopped swimming.<ref name=":9" />

She loved watching her sister’s work-outs with thri Dad, when she was eight and her sister 16, so her parents signed her up for a class at a local club and after a few months, she was accepted into local events. Her „break-through” came at the age of 9, where after leading the u12 club team to four qualification round victories, she qualified for the u12 National Championships. A few weeks later, she won her 1st Hungarian National Championship title.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bio|url=https://babostimea.hu/en/profile/|access-date=November 20, 2020|website=babostimea.hu}}</ref> As of age of 15, she travelled to [[United Kingdom]] to practice owing to her homeland’s lack of sufficient facilities. One of the opportunites were practising on the hardcout, given her country mostly has clay courts. Two years since her arrival in England, she got a good sponsorship deal which meant she could come back and train in [[Budapest]].<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":10">{{Cite web|last=Jennings|first=Will|date=June 12, 2019|title=Timea Babos interview: MM meet Hungary’s pioneering tennis star, fresh from French Open doubles success|url=https://www.mancunianmatters.co.uk/sport/12062019-timea-babos-interview-mm-meet-hungarys-pioneering-tennis-star-fresh-from-french-open-doubles-success/|access-date=November 21, 2020|website=Mancunian Matters}}</ref>

==== Doubles ====
Just like in singles, this season was successful for Babos in doubles. In the United States, she first reached semifinal of the Premier Mandatory [[2016 BNP Paribas Open – Women's Doubles|Indian Wells Open]], followed then with final of the same-category [[2016 Miami Open – Women's Doubles|Miami Open]], where she failed to win the title. In July, she reached her another Grand Slam final at [[2016 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Doubles|Wimbledon]]. This time she partnered with Shvedova, but they lost to Serena and Venus Williams. At the Premier 5 tournaments, she also did quite well, reaching quarterfinal at the 4 out of 5 tournaments. For the second time in a row, she qualified for the [[2016 WTA Finals – Doubles|WTA Finals]]. This time format of the competition was changed, having eliminated rounds, but not round-robin group at first. Babos alongside Shvedova lost in the first round to [[Lucie Šafářová]] and [[Bethanie Mattek-Sands]]. This was first season without doubles titles for Babos since her first title back in 2012.
