On 25 March 1971, after [[Operation Searchlight]], the exiled leadership of what is now Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan and armed struggle against the Pakistani Army began. This struggle was spearheaded by elements of Mukti Bahini with strong support from India. As most of the locals were in support of Mukti Bahini and those who were not were killed by Mukti Bahini, the Pakistani Army, composed largely of elements from [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrelot|first1=Christophe|title=Pakistan : nationalism without a nation?|date=2002|publisher=Manohar Publ.|location=New Delhi|isbn=1842771175|pages=54|edition=1st}}</ref> found itself and its cause pretty much alienated from the local populace.

To counter this situation, the [[Pakistan Army]] accepted help from [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] parties including [[Jamaat-e-Islami]], proclaiming [[Jihad]] against Indians, to seek unity among the population for the two wings of [[Pakistan]], in the name of religion. It described Bengali nationalism as an Indo-Zionist conspiracy. The [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] played an active role in its formation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chengappa|first1=Bidanda M.|title=Pakistan, Islamisation, army and foreign policy|date=2004|publisher=A.P.H.
