In January 2016, she became the youngest female player to be selected and play for the U.S. national team during an Olympic qualifying tournament.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baxter |first1=Kevin |title=Mallory Pugh, 17, becomes youngest woman chosen for U.S. Olympic soccer qualifying roster |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-usa-soccer-olympics-20160127-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 12, 2016 |date=January 26, 2016}}</ref>

After playing extensively with the [[United States U-17 women's national soccer team|U–17]] and [[United States women's national under-20 soccer team|U–20]] teams, Pugh first appeared for the United States senior national team on January 23, 2016 in an international friendly against [[Republic of Ireland women's national football team|Ireland]]. At 17, she was the youngest player to debut for the national team since [[Heather O'Reilly]]'s debut in 2002. Pugh scored in the 83rd minute in her first appearance, becoming the 19th United States player to score in her debut. Shortly after her debut, Pugh was one of the 18 players chosen to represent the United States at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. It was there that Pugh scored her first Olympic goal against [[Colombia women's national football team|Colombia]], giving the United States a 2–1 lead.

At 21, she was the second youngest member of the 2019 team behind 20-year-old [[Tierna Davidson]].

On April 17, 2017, Pugh made the announcement that she would forego her college career with UCLA and turn professional. On May 13, 2017, it was announced that Mallory Pugh had signed to play with [[Washington Spirit]] after negotiations to get to [[Portland Thorns FC]] had failed.
