=== Founding of Demosistō ===
In April 2016, Wong founded a new political party, [[Demosistō]], with other Scholarism leaders including [[Agnes Chow]], Oscar Lai, and Umbrella activists, the original student activist group Scholarism having been disbanded. The party advocated for a referendum to be held to determine Hong Kong's sovereignty after 2047, the scheduled expiration of the [[one country, two systems]] principle enshrined in the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]].

Joshua Wong's release coincided with the ongoing [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests|protests against extradition bill]].<ref name="kris_cheng_hkfp">{{cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/17/just-hong-kong-democracy-leader-joshua-wong-released-prison-calls-chief-exec-carrie-lam-resign/|title=Hong Kong democracy leader Joshua Wong released from prison, calls on Chief Exec.

Wong did not take part with the protesters who forcibly broke into the Hong Kong's parliamentary Legislative Council building on 1 July, but he explained the need behind the move. According to him, the reason behind people entering the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] is that the council is "never democratically elected by people".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-48824110/hong-kong-protests-parliament-never-represented-its-people|title=Hong Kong protests: Parliament 'never represented its people'|work=BBC News|access-date=2 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704061908/https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-48824110/hong-kong-protests-parliament-never-represented-its-people|archive-date=4 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Wong was then arrested again on 29 August 2019 the day before a planned demonstration, which was not given city approval.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49520025|title=Joshua Wong arrested: Hong Kong pro-democracy activist|work=BBC News|access-date=29 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830154424/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49520025|archive-date=30 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 9 September, Wong met with the German Foreign Minister [[Heiko Maas]]. The [[Chinese Foreign Ministry]] called this move "disrespectful of China's sovereignty and an interference in China’s internal affairs".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/09/10/china-fury-hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-meets-german-foreign-minister/ |title=China fury as Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong meets German foreign minister |author=Hui Min Neo |author2=Poornima Weerasekara |date=10 September 2019 |website=Hong Kong Free Press |publisher=AFP  |access-date=10 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190910103436/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/09/10/china-fury-hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-meets-german-foreign-minister/ |archive-date=10 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 17 September, Wong and other student activists participated a [[Congressional-Executive Commission on China]] (CECC) commission in the [[United States Capitol]]. He said that the Chinese government should not grab all the economic benefit from Hong Kong, while attacking the freedom of Hong Kong. He also urged the U.S. Congress to pass the "[[Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act]]". Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman [[Geng Shuang]] responded that the U.S. should not interfere in China's affairs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Yong|first=Charissa|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/hong-kong-activists-joshua-wong-denise-ho-take-cause-to-us-congress-urge-pressure-on|title=Hong Kong activists Joshua Wong, Denise Ho take cause to US Congress, urge pressure on Beijing|work=The Straits Times|date=18 September 2019|access-date=19 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190918140158/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/hong-kong-activists-joshua-wong-denise-ho-take-cause-to-us-congress-urge-pressure-on|archive-date=18 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Speaker of the House of Representatives, [[Nancy Pelosi]], met with Wong on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. on 18 September. Chinese media sharply criticized Pelosi for this meeting, accusing her of "backing and encouraging radical activists."<ref>{{cite news |title=China accuses Pelosi of "interference" as battle rages to control narrative on Hong Kong |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hong-kong-protests-china-accuses-nancy-pelosi-interference-battle-to-control-media-message-2019-09-20/ |publisher=CBS News |date=20 September 2019 |access-date=16 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015175709/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hong-kong-protests-china-accuses-nancy-pelosi-interference-battle-to-control-media-message-2019-09-20/ |archive-date=15 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== 2019 District Councillor election controversy ===
[[File:Joshua Wong Banned from the Election.jpg|thumb|Joshua Wong was banned from the election by the government of Hong Kong on 29 October 2019.]]
On 29 October 2019, Joshua Wong was barred from running in [[2019 Hong Kong local elections|forthcoming district council elections]] in the [[South Horizons West (constituency)|South Horizons West]] constituency by returning officer Laura Liang Aron, who temporarily took over for Dorothy Ma Chau Pui-fun (South Horizon West's returning officer) after the latter took sick leave. Many (including Joshua Wong himself) have accused the Chinese Central Government and the Hong Kong Government of pressuring Returning Officers into disqualifying Joshua Wong.<ref>{{cite web |title=Democracy activist Joshua Wong slams 'politically driven decision' to bar him from running in Hong Kong district council election |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3035285/democracy-activist-joshua-wong-banned-running-hong-kong |website=South China Morning Post |access-date=30 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029073005/https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3035285/democracy-activist-joshua-wong-banned-running-hong-kong |archive-date=29 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== National Security Law and the disbandment of Demosistō ===
On 30 June 2020, Wong, together with [[Agnes Chow]] and [[Nathan Law]], announced respectively on Demosistō's Facebook page that they had quit the group in light of the risk of prosecution under the [[Hong Kong national security law|national security law]] enacted by [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|China]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/150051/Joshua-Wong,-Nathan-Law-and-Agnes-Chow-quit-Demosisto | title=Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Agnes Chow quit Demosisto | language=en | work=The Standard | date=30 June 2020 | access-date=30 June 2020 }}</ref> Hours later, the Demosistō organisation also announced on its blog that it was ceasing all activity, signing off with the message "We will meet again".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ho |first1=Kelly |last2=Grundy |first2=Tom |title=Joshua Wong's pro-democracy group Demosisto disbands hours after Hong Kong security law passed |url=https://hongkongfp.com/2020/06/30/breaking-joshua-wongs-pro-democracy-group-demosisto-disbands-hours-after-hong-kong-security-law-passed/ |access-date=30 June 2020 |work=Hong Kong Free Press |date=30 June 2020}}</ref><ref name=bbc_30_june_2020>{{cite web |title=Hong Kong security law: Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53231158 |date=30 June 2020 |website=BBC |access-date=5 July 2020}}</ref>

=== 2020 legislative election ===
Having risen to political prominence as a teenager, the [[2020 Hong Kong legislative election|2020 Hong Kong Legislative Council Election]] was the first at which Wong was eligible to stand. He announced his candidacy on 20 July, following his poll-topping endorsement by 30,000 voters in the democratic camp's [[2020 Hong Kong pro-democracy primaries|unofficial primaries]].

However, just 10 days later, and five weeks ahead of the election, due on 6 September, the government stated that Wong was among a dozen pro-democracy candidates whose nominations were 'invalid', under the same opaque process that had seen him struck from candidacy in the previous year's District Council election, in which, nominally, civil servants - [[Returning officer|returning officers]] - assess whether, for instance, a candidate had objected to the enactment of the [[Hong Kong national security law|national security law]], or was sincere in statements made disavowing separatism.<ref>[https://hongkongfp.com/2020/07/30/breaking-hong-kong-bans-8-pro-democracy-figures-from-legislative-election/ Hong Kong bans Joshua Wong and 11 other pro-democracy figures from legislative election], HKFP, 30 July 2020</ref>

==Imprisonments==

===Imprisonment in 2017===

{{main|2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists}}
Wong, along with two other prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy student leaders [[Nathan Law]] and [[Alex Chow]], were jailed for six to eight months on 17 August 2017 for unlawful assembly (Wong and Law) and incitement to assemble unlawfully (Chow) at [[Civic Square (Hong Kong)|Civic Square]], at the [[Central Government Complex]] in the [[Tamar, Hong Kong|Tamar]] site, during a protest that triggered the 79-day Occupy sit-ins of 2014. The sentences halted their political careers, as they would be barred from running for public office for five years.<ref name="halted">{{cite news|last1=Siu|first1=Jasmine|title=Joshua Wong and other jailed Hong Kong student leaders see political careers halted|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2107216/occupy-activists-joshua-wong-and-nathan-law-jailed-hong-kong|work=South China Morning Post|date=17 August 2017|access-date=17 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924040955/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2107216/occupy-activists-joshua-wong-and-nathan-law-jailed-hong-kong|archive-date=24 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

On the third anniversary of the 2014 protests, 28 September 2017, Wong started the first of a series of columns for ''[[The Guardian]]'', written from the Pik Uk Correctional Institution, where he said that despite a dull and dry life there, he remained proud of his commitment to the [[Umbrella Movement|movement]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Wong |first=Joshua |date=28 September 2017 |title=Prison is an inevitable part of Hong Kong's exhausting path to democracy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2017/sep/28/prison-hong-kong-exhausting-path-democracy-joshua-wong |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=28 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928031956/https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2017/sep/28/prison-hong-kong-exhausting-path-democracy-joshua-wong |archive-date=28 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 13 October 2017, Wong was convicted with 19 others of contempt of court for obstructing execution of the court's order for clearance of part of the Occupy Central protest zone in Mong Kok in October 2014.  The order had been obtained by a public minibus association.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press|date=13 October 2017|title=Democracy activists Lester Shum and Joshua Wong among 20 guilty of contempt over Mong Kok Occupy protest|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/10/13/breaking-democracy-activists-lester-shum-joshua-wong-among-20-guilty-contempt-mong-kok-occupy-protest/|last=Cheung|first=Karen|access-date=14 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014132914/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/10/13/breaking-democracy-activists-lester-shum-joshua-wong-among-20-guilty-contempt-mong-kok-occupy-protest/|archive-date=14 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 14 November 2017, Wong, together with [[Ivan Lam (student activist)|Ivan Lam]], commenced an application for judicial review in the High Court challenging the constitutionality of the provision in the Legislative Council Ordinance preventing persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment exceeding three months from standing for office for five years from the date of conviction.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/11/14/democracy-activists-joshua-wong-ivan-lam-file-legal-challenge-ban-standing-office/|title=Democracy activists Joshua Wong and Ivan Lam file legal challenge over ban on standing for office|date=14 November 2017|access-date=15 November 2017|last=Cheung|first=Karen|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114132308/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/11/14/democracy-activists-joshua-wong-ivan-lam-file-legal-challenge-ban-standing-office/|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 18 January 2018, Wong was sentenced by Mr Justice Andrew H C Chan of the High Court to three months' imprisonment in respect of his October 2017 conviction for contempt of court.  Nineteen other protesters convicted in respect of the same incident all received prison terms, though the terms were suspended for all but Wong and fellow protester Raphael Wong.  As part of his reasoning, Chan expressed the view that, by November 2014, the protests had become pointless and their only effect was to impact the lives of "ordinary citizens" of the region.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/01/17/breaking-hong-kong-democracy-activists-joshua-wong-raphael-wong-jailed-occupy-site-clearance/|title=Hong Kong democracy activists Joshua Wong and Raphael Wong jailed over Umbrella Movement site clearance|last=Cheng|first=Kris|date=18 January 2018|access-date=18 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117163732/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/01/17/breaking-hong-kong-democracy-activists-joshua-wong-raphael-wong-jailed-occupy-site-clearance/|archive-date=17 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Imprisonment in 2019===

Wong was sentenced to two months of prison on 16 May 2019, for his involvement in events on 26 November 2014 in [[Mong Kok]], an area in Hong Kong, where demonstrators opposed the police during the Umbrella revolution.<ref name="rfa">{{cite web |title=Hong Kong's Leader 'Strongly Objects' to Germany Over Activists' Political Asylum |url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/objects-05242019131046.html |date=24 May 2019 |publisher=Radio Free Asia |access-date=6 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607003315/https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/objects-05242019131046.html |archive-date=7 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="scmp_16_May_2019">{{cite web |title=Occupy poster boy Joshua Wong returns to jail in Hong Kong despite winning appeal for lighter sentence |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3010469/occupy-hong-kong-poster-boy-joshua-wong-jailed-despite |last=Lau |first=Chris |date=16 May 2019 |website=South China Morning Post |access-date=6 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607003245/https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3010469/occupy-hong-kong-poster-boy-joshua-wong-jailed-despite |archive-date=7 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Joshua Wong was released on 17 June 2019, after just around a month time in jail because he had already served some time associated to this case back in 2018, thus adding up to a total of two months' term.<ref>[https://hongkongfp.com/2019/06/17/hong-kongs-joshua-wong-released-prison-monday-party-says/ Hong Kong’s Joshua Wong to be released from prison on Monday, party says]</ref>

===Imprisonment in 2020===
On 24 September 2020, Wong was arrested when he reported to a police station regarding another case against him, for which he is currently on trial. He was charged for "unlawful assembly", which was related to his participation in the 2019 protest against a government ban on face masks, where he was said to have violated the [[Anti-mask law#Hong Kong|anti-mask law]] of Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/hong-kong-police-arrest-pro-democracy-activist-joshua-wong/a-55035796|title=Hong Kong police arrest pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong|date=2020-09-24|work=[[DW News]]|access-date=2020-09-24}}</ref> On 30 September, he was temporarily released by the court along with activist Koo Sze-yiu (古思堯). The Principal Magistrate granted the two bail of [[HK$]]1,000 each, and imposed a travel ban on Wong at the prosecutors’ request. The cases against Wong and Koo will be heard again on December 18.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3103648/hong-kong-court-grants-activist-joshua-wong-temporary|title=Hong Kong court grants activist Joshua Wong temporary release on unauthorised assembly, mask ban charges|last=Wong|first=Brian|date=2020-09-30|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2020-10-02}}</ref>

On 23 November 2020, Wong appeared with [[Ivan Lam Long-yin]] and [[Agnes Chow|Agnes Chow Ting]] in the West Kowloon District Court, where they had been expected to stand trial over their roles in the anti extradition bill protest on 21 June 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-06-21|title=Hong Kong anti-extradition protesters occupy roads at gov't and police HQ after vowing 'escalation'|url=https://hongkongfp.com/2019/06/21/breaking-hong-kongs-anti-extradition-protesters-flock-legislature-block-traffic-govt-hq-shuts/|access-date=2020-11-23|website=Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|language=en-GB}}</ref> He was charged with organising an unauthorised assembly and of inciting others to take part in the event. He pleaded guilty, and sentencing would commence on Wednesday 2 December 2020. Before appearing in court, Wong said the trio were prepared to face immediate jail terms, and hoped their stance would draw global attention to a criminal justice system he claimed was being “manipulated by Beijing”.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-11-23|title=Hong Kong opposition trio face jail after police HQ siege guilty pleas|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3110933/hong-kong-opposition-pair-joshua-wong-and-ivan-lam|access-date=2020-11-23|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}</ref>
