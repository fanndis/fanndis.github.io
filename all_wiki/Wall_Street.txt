'''Wall Street''' is an eight-block-long street in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Lower Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. It runs between [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in the west to [[South Street (Manhattan)|South Street]] and the [[East River]] in the east. The term "Wall Street" has become a [[metonym]] for the financial markets of the [[United States]] as a whole, the [[Financial services in the United States|American financial services industry]], New York–based financial interests, or the Financial District itself.

Wall Street was originally known in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as "de Waalstraat" when it was part of [[New Amsterdam]] in the 17th century, though the origins of the name vary. An actual wall existed on the street from 1685 to 1699. During the 17th century, Wall Street was a slave trading marketplace and a securities trading site, as well as the location of [[Federal Hall]], New York's first city hall. In the early 19th century, both residences and businesses occupied the area, but increasingly business predominated, and New York City's financial industry became centered on Wall Street. In the 20th century, several [[early skyscrapers]] were built on Wall Street, including [[40 Wall Street]], once the world's tallest building.

Wall Street is home to the world's two [[List of stock exchanges|largest stock exchanges]] by total [[market capitalization]], the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and [[NASDAQ]]. Several other major exchanges have or had headquarters in the Wall Street area, including the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]], the [[New York Board of Trade]], the New York Futures Exchange (NYFE), and the former [[American Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Chen|first=James|title=New York Futures Exchange (NYFE)|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyfe.asp|access-date=2020-09-06|website=Investopedia|language=en}}</ref> To support the exchanges, many brokerage firms had offices "clustered around Wall Street". The direct economic impacts of Wall Street activities extend beyond New York City.

Wall Street physically contains several banking headquarters and skyscrapers, as well as the [[Federal Hall National Memorial]]. The street is served by three [[New York City Subway|subway]] stations and a ferry stop.

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:CastelloPlanOriginal.jpg|thumb|The original city map called the [[Castello Plan]] from 1660, showing the wall on the right side]]
There are varying accounts about how the Dutch-named "de Waalstraat"<ref name="let.rug.nl">[http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/images/nadam2.gif The street on the map of Nieuw-Amsterdam]</ref>(literally: Walloon Street) got its name. Two conflicting explanations can be considered.

The first being that Wall Street was named after ''[[Walloons]]''—the Dutch name for a ''Walloon'' is ''Waal''.<ref name="walloonswallets">{{cite news |url=https://www.loc.gov/wiseguide/mar09/wallets.html |title=Walloons and Wallets |date=March 2009 |access-date=September 24, 2010 |publisher=the loc.gov}}</ref> Among the first settlers that embarked on the ship ''Nieu Nederlandt'' in 1624 were 30 Walloon families. [[Peter Minuit]], the person who bought Manhattan for the Dutch, was a Walloon.

The other is that the name of the street was derived from a wall or [[Defensive wall|rampart]] (actually a wooden palisade) on the northern boundary of the [[New Amsterdam]] settlement, built to protect against [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], pirates, and the British. The wall was built of dirt and {{convert|15|ft|adj=on}} wooden planks, measuring {{convert|2,340|ft}} long and {{convert|9|ft}} tall.<ref name="History.com Wall Street Timeline">{{Cite web|title=Wall Street Timeline: From a Wooden Wall to a Symbol of Economic Power|url=https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/wall-street-timeline|access-date=2020-09-06|website=HISTORY|language=en}}</ref>

While the Dutch word "wal" can be translated as "rampart", it only appeared as "De Wal Straat" on some English maps of New Amsterdam, whereas other English maps show the name as "De Waal Straat".<ref name="let.rug.nl" />

According to one version of the story:

{{quote|The red people from Manhattan Island crossed to the mainland, where a treaty was made with the Dutch, and the place was therefore called the Pipe of Peace, in their language, Hoboken. But soon after that, the Dutch governor, [[Willem Kieft|Kieft]], sent his men out there one night and massacred the entire population. Few of them escaped, but they spread the story of what had been done, and this did much to antagonize all the remaining tribes against all the white settlers. Shortly after, Nieuw Amsterdam erected a double palisade for defense against its now enraged red neighbors, and this remained for some time the northern limit of the Dutch city. The space between the former walls is now called Wall Street, and its spirit is still that of a bulwark against the people.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sidis |first=William James |author-link=William James Sidis  | title=The Tribes and the States | via=Sidis Archives | access-date=November 20, 2019|chapter=7|chapter-url=https://www.sidis.net/TSChap2.htm#War%20and%20Peace |year= 1935}}</ref>}}

[[Slavery in the United States|Slavery]] was introduced to Manhattan in 1626, but it was not until December 13, 1711, that the New York City Common Council made Wall Street the city's first official slave market for the sale and rental of enslaved Africans and Indians.<ref>[http://maap.columbia.edu/place/22.html Slave Market].

In the late 18th century, there was a [[American sycamore|buttonwood]] tree at the foot of Wall Street under which traders and speculators would gather to trade securities.

In the first few decades, both residences and businesses occupied the area, but increasingly business predominated.

Business writer [[John Brooks (writer)|John Brooks]] in his book ''Once in Golconda'' considered the start of the 20th century period to have been Wall Street's heyday.<ref name=twsJanO53a/> The address of [[23 Wall Street]], the headquarters of [[J.P.

Wall Street has had changing relationships with government authorities.

To guard against a vehicular bombing in the area, authorities built concrete barriers, and found ways over time to make them more aesthetically appealing by spending $5000 to $8000 apiece on [[bollard]]s. Parts of Wall Street, as well as several other streets in the neighborhood, were blocked off by specially designed bollards:

Wall Street's architecture is generally rooted in the [[Gilded Age]].<ref name="twsJanN312a2"/> The older skyscrapers often were built with elaborate facades, which have not been common in corporate architecture for decades. There are numerous landmarks on Wall Street, some of which were erected as the headquarters of banks. These include:

One estimate was that Wall Street firms employed close to 200,000 persons in 2008.<ref name=twsJanN214a/> Another estimate was that in 2007, the financial services industry which had a $70 billion profit became 22 percent of the city's revenue.<ref name="twsJanO23b">{{cite news |author=Patrick McGeehan |title=After Reversal of Fortunes, City Takes a New Look at Wall Street |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 22, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/nyregion/23wall.html |access-date=January 15, 2011}}</ref> Another estimate (in 2006) was that the financial services industry makes up 9% of the city's work force and 31% of the tax base.<ref name="twsJanO46">{{cite news |author=Heather Timmons |title=New York Isn't the World's Undisputed Financial Capital |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 27, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/27/business/worldbusiness/27london.html |access-date=January 15, 2011}}</ref> An additional estimate from 2007 by [[Steven Malanga|Steve Malanga]] of the [[Manhattan Institute]] was that the securities industry accounts for 4.7 percent of the jobs in New York City but 20.7 percent of its wages, and he estimated there were 175,000 securities-industries jobs in New York (both Wall Street area and midtown) paying an average of $350,000 annually.<ref name=twsJanO53a/> Between 1995 and 2005, the sector grew at an annual rate of about 6.6% annually, a respectable rate, but that other financial centers were growing faster.<ref name=twsJanO53a/> Another estimate, made in 2008, was that Wall Street provided a fourth of all personal income earned in the city, and 10% of New York City's tax revenue.<ref name="twsJan62O">{{cite news |author=Patrick McGeehan |title=As Financial Empires Shake, City Feels No. 2 on Its Heels |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 12, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/13/nyregion/13rivalry.html |access-date=January 15, 2011}}</ref>  The city's securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the city's financial sector and an important economic engine, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of private sector jobs in New York City, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of the city's tax revenue, and 22 percent of the city's total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osc.state.ny.us/osdc/rpt7-2014.pdf |title=The Securities Industry in New York City |author=Thomas P.

The seven largest Wall Street firms in the 2000s were [[Bear Stearns]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Citigroup]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Merrill Lynch]] and [[Lehman Brothers]].<ref name=twsJanN214a/> During the recession of 2008–10, many of these firms, including Lehman, went out of business or were bought up at firesale prices by other financial firms. In 2008, Lehman filed for bankruptcy,<ref name=twsJanO12a/> [[Bear Stearns]] was bought by [[JPMorgan Chase]]<ref name=twsJanO12a/> forced by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]],<ref name=twsJanO37/> and [[Merrill Lynch]] was bought by [[Bank of America]] in a similar shot-gun wedding. These failures marked a catastrophic downsizing of Wall Street as the financial industry goes through restructuring and change. Since New York's financial industry provides almost one-fourth of all income produced in the city, and accounts for 10% of the city's tax revenues and 20% of the state's, the downturn has had huge repercussions for government treasuries.<ref name=twsJanN214a/> New York's mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] reportedly over a four-year period dangled over $100 million in tax incentives to persuade Goldman Sachs to build a 43-story headquarters in the Financial District near the destroyed World Trade Center site.<ref name="twsJanO23b"/> In 2009, things looked somewhat gloomy, with one analysis by the [[Boston Consulting Group]] suggesting that 65,000 jobs had been permanently lost because of the downturn.<ref name="twsJanO23b"/> But there were signs that Manhattan property prices were rebounding with price rises of 9% annually in 2010, and bonuses were being paid once more, with average bonuses over $124,000 in 2010.<ref name=twsJanO12a/>

====Versus Midtown Manhattan====
A requirement of the New York Stock Exchange was that brokerage firms had to have offices "clustered around Wall Street" so clerks could deliver physical paper copies of stock certificates each week.<ref name=twsJanN215a/> There were some indications that midtown had been becoming the locus of financial services dealings even by 1911.<ref name="twsJanN215xx">{{cite news |title=WALL STREET BANKS CONNECTING UPTOWN; Financial District Notes This as American Exchange National Buys Into the Pacific. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 27, 1911 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1911/05/27/archives/wall-street-banks-connecting-uptown-financial-district-notes-this.html |access-date=January 14, 2010}}</ref> But as technology progressed, in the middle and later decades of the 20th century, computers and telecommunications replaced paper notifications, meaning that the close proximity requirement could be bypassed in more situations.<ref name=twsJanN215a/> Many financial firms found that they could move to [[Midtown Manhattan]], only four miles away,<ref name="twsJanN312a2"/> and still operate effectively. For example, the former investment firm of [[Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette]] was described as a ''Wall Street firm'' but had its headquarters on [[Park Avenue]] in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]].<ref name="twsJanN212">{{cite news |author=Heidi N. Moore |title=DLJ: Wall Street's Incubator |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 10, 2008 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2008/03/10/the-little-bank-that-was-wall-streets-incubator/ |access-date=January 14, 2010}}</ref> A report described the migration from Wall Street:

Nevertheless, a key magnet for the Wall Street remains the [[New York Stock Exchange Building]]. Some "old guard" firms such as [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Merrill Lynch]] (bought by [[Bank of America]] in 2009), have remained "fiercely loyal to the Financial District" location, and new ones such as [[Deutsche Bank]] have chosen office space in the district.<ref name=twsJanN215a/> So-called "face-to-face" trading between buyers and sellers remains a "cornerstone" of the NYSE, with a benefit of having all of a deal's players close at hand, including [[Investment banking|investment bankers]], [[lawyer]]s, and [[accountant]]s.<ref name=twsJanN215a/>

====In the New Jersey economy====
{{main|Wall Street West}}
After Wall Street firms started to expand westward in the 1980s into [[New Jersey]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Winston |title=On the Jersey City Docks, Wall St. West |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/28/nyregion/on-the-jersey-city-docks-wall-st-west.html |access-date=June 28, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 28, 1988}}</ref> the direct economic impacts of Wall Street activities have gone beyond New York City. The employment in the financial services industry, mostly in the "back office" roles, has become an important part of New Jersey's economy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Scott-Quinn |first=Brian |title=Finance, investment banking and the international bank credit and capital markets : a guide to the global industry and its governance in the new age of uncertainty |date=July 31, 2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Houndmills, Basingstoke |isbn=978-0230370470 |page=66 |access-date=June 29, 2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dv9TrTcZeGQC}}</ref> In 2009, the Wall Street employment wages were paid in the amount of almost $18.5 billion in the state. The industry contributed $39.4 billion or 8.4 percent to the New Jersey's [[gross domestic product]] in the same year.<ref name="njfinance">{{cite web |title=Finance |url=http://www.nj.gov/njnextstop/home/finance/ |work=New Jersey Next Stop ... Your Career |publisher=State of New Jersey |access-date=June 29, 2013}}</ref>

The most significant area with Wall Street employment is in [[Jersey City]]. In 2008, the "Wall Street West" employment contributed to one third of the [[private sector]] jobs in Jersey City. Within the Financial Service cluster, there were three major sectors: more than 60 percent were in the [[Security (finance)|securities industry]]; 20 percent were in [[bank]]ing; and 8 percent in [[insurance]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Your Gateway to Opportunity, Enterprise Zone Five Year Strategic Plan 2010 |url=http://www.jcedc.org/Pages/JerseyCity%20UEZ_Economics.pdf |publisher=Jersey City Economic Development Corporation |access-date=June 29, 2013}}</ref>

Additionally, New Jersey has become the main technology infrastructure to support the Wall Street operations. A substantial amount of securities traded in the United States are executed in New Jersey as the [[data center]]s of electronic trading in the U.S. equity market for all major stock exchanges are located in [[North Jersey|North]] and [[Central Jersey]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Bowley |first=Graham |title=The New Speed of Money, Reshaping Markets |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/business/02speed.html?pagewanted=all |access-date=June 29, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=NASDAQ OMX Express Connect |url=http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/Productsservices/trading/CoLo/ExpressConnect_factsheet.pdf |publisher=NASDAQ OMX |access-date=June 29, 2013}}</ref> A significant amount of securities [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] and [[Settlement (finance)|settlement]] workforce is also in the state. This includes the majority of the workforce of Depository Trust Company,<ref>{{cite web |title=DTC Operations Move to Newport, New Jersey |url=http://www.dtcc.com/downloads/legal/imp_notices/2012/dtc/ope/0481-12.pdf |publisher=The Depository Trust Company |access-date=June 29, 2013 |date=September 10, 2012}}</ref> the primary U.S. securities [[Depository bank|depository]]; and the [[Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Gregory |first=Bresiger |title=DTCC Moves Most Operations to NJ |url=http://www.tradersmagazine.com/news/dtcc-moves-most-operations-to-nj-110623-1.html |access-date=June 29, 2013 |newspaper=Traders Magazine |date=December 14, 2012}}</ref> the parent company of National Securities Clearing Corporation, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and Emerging Markets Clearing Corporation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clearing Agencies |url=https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrclearing.shtml |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |access-date=June 29, 2013}}</ref>

Having a direct tie to Wall Street employment can be problematic for New Jersey, however. The state lost 7.9 percent of its employment base from 2007 to 2010 in the financial services sector in the fallout of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].<ref name="njfinance"/>

====Competing financial centers====
{{Main|Financial centre}}

Of the street's importance as a financial center, ''[[New York Times]]'' analyst [[Daniel Gross]] wrote:

{{quote|In today's burgeoning and increasingly integrated global financial markets&nbsp;— a vast, neural spaghetti of wires, Web sites and trading platforms&nbsp;— the N.Y.S.E. is clearly no longer the epicenter. Nor is New York. The largest mutual-fund complexes are in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania|Valley Forge, Pa.]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[Boston]], while trading and money management are spreading globally. Since the end of the cold war, vast pools of capital have been forming overseas, in the Swiss bank accounts of Russian oligarchs, in the Shanghai vaults of Chinese manufacturing magnates and in the coffers of funds controlled by governments in [[Singapore]], [[Russia]], [[Dubai]], [[Qatar]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] that may amount to some $2.5 trillion.|Daniel Gross in 2007<ref name=twsJanO53a/>}}

An example is the alternative trading platform known as [[BATS Global Markets|BATS]], based in [[Kansas City]], which came "out of nowhere to gain a 9 percent share in the market for trading United States stocks".<ref name=twsJanO53a/> The firm has computers in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]], two salespersons in New York City, but the remaining 33 employees work in a center in Kansas.<ref name=twsJanO53a/>

===In the public imagination===

====As a financial symbol====
Wall Street in a conceptual sense represents financial and economic power. To Americans, it can sometimes represent elitism and power politics, and its role has been a source of controversy throughout the nation's history, particularly beginning around the [[Gilded Age]] period in the late 19th century. Wall Street became the symbol of a country and economic system that many Americans see as having developed through trade, capitalism, and innovation.<ref>Fraser (2005).</ref>

The term "Wall Street" has become a [[metonym]] for the financial markets of the United States as a whole, the [[Financial services in the United States|American financial services industry]], or New York–based financial interests.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Investing|first1=Full Bio Follow Twitter Joshua Kennon co-authored "The Complete Idiot's Guide to|last2=Edition"|first2=3rd|last3=Kennon|first3=runs his own asset management firm for the affluent Read The Balance's editorial policies Joshua|title=Learn how Wall Street works|url=https://www.thebalance.com/introduction-to-wall-street-for-beginners-358143|access-date=2020-09-06|website=The Balance|language=en}}</ref><ref>[http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Wall%20Street Merriam-Webster Online], retrieved July 17, 2007.</ref> Wall Street has become synonymous with financial interests, often used negatively.<ref name="twsJanN112">{{cite web |author=Robert Kuttner |title=Zillions for Wall Street, Zippo for Barack's Old Neighborhood |website=Huffington Post |date=August 22, 2010 |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-kuttner/zillions-for-wall-street-_b_690541.html |access-date=January 14, 2010}}</ref> During the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] from 2007–10, Wall Street financing was blamed as one of the causes, although most commentators blame an interplay of factors. The U.S. government with the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] bailed out the banks and financial backers with billions of taxpayer dollars, but the bailout was often criticized as politically motivated,<ref name=twsJanN112/> and was criticized by journalists as well as the public. Analyst [[Robert Kuttner]] in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' criticized the bailout as helping large Wall Street firms such as Citigroup while neglecting to help smaller community development banks such as Chicago's [[ShoreBank]].<ref name=twsJanN112/> One writer in the ''Huffington Post'' looked at [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] statistics on robbery, fraud, and crime and concluded that Wall Street was the "most dangerous neighborhood in the United States" if one factored in the $50 billion [[fraud]] perpetrated by [[Bernie Madoff]].<ref>{{cite web |author=B.

When large firms such as [[Enron]], [[WorldCom]], and [[Global Crossing]] were found guilty of fraud, Wall Street was often blamed,<ref name="twsJanO15a" /> even though these firms had headquarters around the nation and not in Wall Street.

When the [[United States Treasury]] bailed out large financial firms, to ostensibly halt a downward spiral in the nation's economy, there was tremendous negative political fallout, particularly when reports came out that monies supposed to be used to ease credit restrictions were being used to pay bonuses to highly paid employees.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hard Times, But Big Wall Street Bonuses |publisher=CBS News |date=November 12, 2008 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/12/earlyshow/main4595179.shtml |access-date=January 14, 2010}}</ref> Analyst [[William D.

[[File:60 Wall Street building.jpg|thumb|upright|right|US headquarters of [[Deutsche Bank]] on Wall Street in 2010.]]
But chief banking analyst at [[Goldman Sachs]], Richard Ramsden, is "unapologetic" and sees "banks as the dynamos that power the rest of the economy".<ref name=twsJanO12a/> Ramsden believes "risk-taking is vital" and said in 2010:

{{quote|You can construct a banking system in which no bank will ever fail, in which there's no leverage. But there would be a cost. There would be virtually no economic growth because there would be no credit creation.|Richard Ramsden of Goldman Sachs, 2010.<ref name=twsJanO12a/>}}

Others in the financial industry believe they've been unfairly castigated by the public and by politicians. For example, Anthony Scaramucci reportedly told President [[Barack Obama]] in 2010 that he felt like a [[piñata]], "whacked with a stick" by "hostile politicians".<ref name=twsJanO12a/>

The financial misdeeds of various figures throughout American history sometimes casts a dark shadow on financial investing as a whole, and include names such as [[William Duer (Continental Congressman)|William Duer]], [[James Fisk (financier)|Jim Fisk]] and [[Jay Gould]] (the latter two believed to have been involved with an effort to collapse the U.S. gold market in 1869) as well as modern figures such as [[Bernard Madoff]] who "bilked billions from investors".<ref name="twsJanN413">{{cite news|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/walking-tours-nyc-11759.html|title=Walking Tours of NYC|author=T.L.

In addition, images of Wall Street and its figures have loomed large. The 1987 [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' created the iconic figure of [[Gordon Gekko]] who used the phrase "greed is good", which caught on in the cultural parlance.<ref name=twsJanN514/> Gekko is reportedly based on multiple real-life individuals on Wall Street, including corporate raider Carl Icahn, disgraced stock trader Ivan Boesky, and investor Michael Ovitz.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Chen|first=James|title=Who Is Gordon Gekko?|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordon-gekko.asp|access-date=2020-09-06|website=Investopedia|language=en}}</ref> In 2009, Stone commented how the film had had an unexpected cultural influence, not causing them to turn away from corporate greed, but causing many young people to choose Wall Street careers because of the film.<ref name="twsJanN514">{{cite news |author=Tim Arango |title=Greed Is Bad, Gekko.

Wall Street firms have, however, also contributed to projects such as [[Habitat for Humanity]], as well as done food programs in [[Haiti]], trauma centers in [[Sudan]], and rescue boats during floods in [[Bangladesh]].<ref name="twsJanN111">{{cite news |author=Emily Wax |title=Wall Street Greed?

==Transportation==
[[File:Pier 11 at Wall Street ferry.JPG|thumb|right|Pier 11]]
With Wall Street being historically a commuter destination, a plethora of transportation infrastructure has been developed to serve it.
