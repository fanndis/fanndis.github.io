The '''''Fortune'' 500''' is an annual list compiled and published by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine that ranks 500 of the largest [[United States]] [[Joint-stock company#Closely held corporations and publicly traded corporations|corporations]] by total revenue for their respective fiscal years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fortune.com/fortune500/ |title=Fortune 500 |website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref> The list includes [[publicly held company|publicly held companies]], along with [[Privately held company|privately held companies]] for which revenues are publicly available. The concept of the ''Fortune'' 500 was created by Edgar P. Smith, a ''Fortune'' editor, and the first list was published in 1955.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|title=Edgar Smith, 69, Dies; Retired Time Executive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/12/obituaries/edgar-smith-69-dies-retired-time-executive.html|newspaper=New York Times |access-date=March 1, 2016|date=October 12, 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1955 Full list|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500_archive/full/1955/|website=Fortune |publisher=Fortune 500|access-date=March 1, 2016}}</ref> The ''Fortune'' 500 is more commonly used than its subset ''Fortune'' 100 or superset [[Fortune 1000|''Fortune'' 1000]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Sean|title=''Fortune'' 100: Everything You've Ever Wanted to Know About This Popular Annual Ranking|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/06/03/fortune-100-everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-know-a.aspx|website=The Motley Fool|access-date=March 1, 2016|date=June 4, 2015}}</ref>

== History ==
The ''Fortune'' 500,  created by Edgar P. Smith, was first published in 1955.<ref name=":0" /> The original top ten companies were [[General Motors]], [[ExxonMobil|Jersey Standard]], [[U.S. Steel]], [[General Electric]], [[JBS USA|Esmark]], [[Chrysler]], [[Armour and Company|Armour]], [[Gulf Oil]], [[Mobil]] and [[DuPont (1802–2017)|DuPont]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/06/02/first-fortune-500|title=What happened to the first Fortune 500?|website=Fortune|access-date=March 24, 2017}}</ref>

==Methodology==
The original ''Fortune'' 500 was limited to companies whose revenues were derived from manufacturing, mining, and energy exploration. At the same time, ''Fortune'' published companion "''Fortune'' 50" lists of the 50 largest commercial banks (ranked by assets), utilities (ranked by assets), life insurance companies (ranked by assets), retailers (ranked by gross revenues) and transportation companies (ranked by revenues). ''Fortune'' magazine changed its methodology in 1994 to include service companies. With the change came 291 new entrants to the famous list including three in the Top 10.<ref>{{cite news |last=Groves |first=Martha |date=April 26, 1995 |title=Service Now Counts with Fortune 500 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-26/business/fi-59111_1_fortune-services-companies |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=October 12, 2017}}</ref> There is a lag in creating the list, so for example, the 2019 ''Fortune'' 500 is based on each company's financial years ending in late 2018 (most commonly, on December 31), or early 2019.

==Influence==
As of 2020, the ''Fortune'' 500 companies represent approximately two-thirds of the [[Economy of the United States#GDP|United States's Gross Domestic Product]] with approximately $14.2 trillion in revenue, $1.2 trillion in profits, and $20.4 trillion in total market value. These revenue figures also account for approximately 18% of the [[gross world product]]. The companies collectively employ a total of 29.2 million people worldwide, or nearly 0.4% of the [[World population|Earth's total population]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Klooster|first=Alison|date=May 18, 2020|title=FORTUNE Announces 2020 FORTUNE 500 List, Launches First Ever "History Of The FORTUNE 500" Data Analytics Visualization Site With Partner Qli|publisher=Cision PR Newswire|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fortune-announces-2020-fortune-500-list-launches-first-ever-history-of-the-fortune-500-data-analytics-visualization-site-with-partner-qlik-301060615.html|access-date=October 1, 2020}}</ref>
