Santa Catarina is bordered by [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] to the north, [[Rio Grande do Sul]] to the south, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east, and to the west by the [[Provinces of Argentina|Argentine province]] of [[Misiones Province|Misiones]]. The coastal path is over 450 km, i.e., about half of Portugal's mainland coast. The host city of the state [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[judiciary]] powers is the capital [[Florianópolis]]. [[Joinville]], however, is the most populous city in the state. Besides [[Espírito Santo]], Santa Catarina is the only state whose capital is not the most populous city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/?codmun=420910|title=IBGE {{!}} Cities {{!}} Santa Catarina {{!}} Joinville|website=cidades.ibge.gov.br|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> South of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], situated in the planet's southern [[temperate zone]], the state has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') in the east and west and an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') in the center.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/schweiz/mz/2013/00000022/00000006/art00008?token=004f10bb383a4b3b2570507b6c5f6c6a2d7c49665d2a726e2d58464340592f3f3b576b0d0e0f4ce|title=Köppen's climate classification map for Brazil|last1=Alvares|first1=Clayton Alcarde|last2=Stape|first2=José Luiz|date=December 2013|website=www.ingentaconnect.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09|last3=Sentelhas|first3=Paulo Cesar|last4=de Moraes Gonçalves|first4=José Leonardo|last5=Sparovek|first5=Gerd}}</ref> Climatic conditions vary according to the relief of the region: in the west and mountainous plateau, it is relatively frequent that [[Frost|frosts]] and [[snow]] occur, while on the coast the climate is warmer, capable of reaching high temperatures in summer.<ref name=":1" />

The territory of Santa Catarina is one of the oldest states in Brazil, separated from [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] in 1738, its first governor being [[José da Silva Pais]]. The state was created for one reason only: to extend the Portuguese domains to southern Brazil until reaching the [[Río de la Plata|Rio de la Plata]] region. It is also the oldest state of the [[South Region, Brazil|South Region of Brazil]], older than [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (1807) and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] (1853). The state of Santa Catarina was very settled by European immigrants: the coast was colonized by the [[Azores|Azorean]] [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in the [[18th century]]; the Itajaí Valley ''–'' a portion of the southern region and northern Santa Catarina ''–'' was settled by the [[Germans]] in the mid [[19th century]].<ref>CABRAL, Oswaldo R.

[[File:Aereal_view_of_Florianopolis_SC_69_03_2006.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Florianópolis]]]]
Santa Catarina is in a very strategic position in [[Mercosul]], the South American Common Market.  Its position in the map is situated between the parallel 25º57'41" and 29º23'55" of the Southern latitude and between the meridians 48º19'37" and 53º50'00" of Western longitude. [[Florianópolis]], its capital, is {{convert|1,673|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Brasilia]], {{convert|705|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[São Paulo]], {{convert|1,144|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Rio de Janeiro]] and {{convert|1,850|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Buenos Aires]].

The [[Serra Geral]], a southern extension of the [[Serra do Mar]], runs north and south through the state parallel to the Atlantic coast, dividing the state between a narrow coastal plain and a larger plateau region to the west.

The Atlantic coast of Santa Catarina has many beaches, islands, bays, inlets, and lagoons.  The humid tropical [[Serra do Mar coastal forests]] cover the narrow coastal zone, which is crossed by numerous short streams from the wooded slopes of the serras.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Santa Catharina |volume=24 |page=185}}</ref>

The central part of the state is home to the [[Araucaria moist forests]], dominated by emergent [[Brazilian pine]]s ''(Araucaria angustifolia).''  The drainage of the plateau is westward to the [[Paraná River]], the rivers being tributaries of the [[Iguaçu River|Iguaçu]], which forms its northern boundary, and of the [[Uruguay River]], which forms its southern boundary.<ref name=EB1911/>  The semi-deciduous [[Paraná-Paraíba interior forests]] occupy the westernmost valleys of the Iguaçu and Uruguay rivers.

The highest point of the state is the [[Morro da Boa Vista]], with an altitude of 1,827 m, and the second highest point is the [[Morro da Igreja]], in the town of [[Urubici]], with an altitude of 1,822 m.

== History ==

[[File:PomerodeNorthGate.jpg|thumb|[[Pomerode]], A [[Pomerania]]n-German colony in Santa Catarina]]
European settlement began with the Spanish settlement of [[Santa Catarina island]] in 1542.  The Portuguese took control in 1675 and established the captaincy of Santa Catarina in 1738, bringing families from the [[Azores]] to populate the shore.

In 1839, during the [[Ragamuffin War]], there was an unsuccessful attempt for Santa Catarina to secede from the [[Empire of Brazil]] to form the independent [[Juliana Republic]] (allied with the [[Riograndense Republic]] to the south) which was defeated after four months.[[File:Mapa do estado de Santa Catarina.tif|thumb|Map of the State of Santa Catarina, 1907. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil]].]]Between early 19th century and mid 20th century, a great number of European immigrants arrived to Santa Catarina; these immigrants were taken in order to populate the south of the Nation by [[Empire of Brazil|Imperial]] initiative. About 50% of these immigrants were from [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].<ref name="Immigration-to-Santa-Catarina">''Ferreira Levy, Maria Stella''. {{in lang|pt}} [http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rsp/v8s0/03.pdf O Papel da Migração Internacional na Evolução da População Brasileira]. pp. 58, 79 {{quote|Santa Catarina, tem como grupo nacional mais importante os alemães cujas proporções oscilam ao redor de 40%, seguidos pelos italianos, com aproximadamente 17%, até o censo de 1950.

As outras nacionalidades que tem expressão são poloneses, russos e austríacos com proporções entre 6 e 11%, considerando-se inclusive o censo de 1970.|Page 58}}</ref> The rest came mainly from [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Switzerland]], [[Lithuania]], [[France]], [[Finland]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Estonia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Latvia]];<ref name="Immigration-to-Santa-Catarina" /> these immigrants created an abundance of small, family-held farms, many of which continue to exist in the interior of the state.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
 
Late in March 2004, the state was hit by the first [[hurricane]] ever recorded in the [[South Atlantic]].  Because there is no naming system for such an event in Brazil, Brazilian [[meteorology|meteorologists]] called it [[Hurricane Catarina]], after the state.

==Demographics==

According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] of 2008, there were 6,091,000 people residing in the state. The population density was {{convert|61.53|PD/km2|PD/sqmi}}.

[[Urbanization]]: 83% (2006); [[Population growth]]: 2% (1991–2000); [[House]]s: 1,836,000 (2006).<ref>Source: PNAD.</ref>

The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 5,297,000 [[White Brazilian|White]] people (86.96%), 608,000 [[Brown people#Pardos in Brazil|Brown]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|Multiracial]]) people (9.98%), 160,000 [[Afro-Brazilian|Black]] people (2.63%), 15,000 [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] people (0.25%), 5,000 [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] people (0.09%).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.asp?z=pnad&o=3&i=P&c=262 |publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|location=Santa Catarina, Brazil|format=PDF|title=Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios|isbn=978-85-240-3919-5|accessdate=2010-01-18|year=2008|language=pt}}</ref>

People of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] ancestry, mostly [[Azorean people|Azoreans]], predominate on the coast. People of [[German Brazilian|German]] descent predominate in the northeast region ([[Itajaí Valley]]) and in the north ([[Joinville]] region). There are many German communities in the west. People of [[Italo-Brazilian|Italian]] descent predominate in the south, as well in many areas in the west. People of [[Afro-Brazilian|African]], [[Amerindian]] or [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]] origin are present in small communities in a few towns.<ref>[http://www.sc.gov.br/conteudo/santacatarina/turismo/contrastes/gente.html Santa Catarina - Terra de Contrastes - Os Jeitos da Terra<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212103628/http://www.sc.gov.br/conteudo/santacatarina/turismo/contrastes/gente.html |date=December 12, 2007 }}</ref>

One of the Brazilian states that exhibits the most evident signs of 19th-century European immigration, Santa Catarina, where the vast majority of the population descends from European settlers, is also the state with the highest percentage of European phenotype citizens.

The state is also famous for having towns where most of the population belongs to a single main ancestry thanks to the settlement program with European colonists. Here are a few examples of such towns in the Southern region:

===Portuguese===
[[File:Florianopolis SAntonioLisboa house.jpg|thumb|[[Azores|Azorean Portuguese]] house in [[Florianópolis]].]]
The [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] started arriving in the 1750s, mainly from the [[Azores]] islands, and colonized the coast. In the late 18th century, half of Santa Catarina's population was Portuguese-born. These Portuguese established many important towns in the state, such as [[Florianópolis]], the capital.

===Germans and Austrians===

[[German people]] started arriving in 1828, after Brazilian independence. These were peasants attracted by the opportunity to have their own land, as [[German Confederation|Germanic countries]] were overpopulated and many people had no land to work. German immigration was very low until the 1850s, when waves started arriving in southern Brazil. To stimulate the German colonization of southern Brazil, the Brazilian government created many German colonies: these were ethnically Germanic areas where people from many parts of what is now Germany, Austria, Czech Republic and Poland settled. Initially, these colonies were in rural areas, where immigrants were able to cultivate their own farms. Many of these German colonies developed greatly and became large cities, [[Joinville]] and [[Blumenau]] a, among them.
[[File:Joinville Forum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joinville]], the largest city of Santa Catarina, settled by Germans in 1851.]]

Germans were isolated in rural communities for decades.  They did not have much contact with the other peoples of Brazil, and for generations they were able to speak the [[German language]] and maintain German traditions in Brazil. This situation changed in 1942, during [[World War II]], when Brazil declared war on Germany, and German immigrants and their descendants were required to learn [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and to culturally integrate their respective states.

Still, German influence in the state remains very strong and visible.  Many towns and cities retain notable aspects of German culture: in [[Pomerode]], for example, a small town in which nine-tenths of the population is of [[German-Brazilian]] descent, most inhabitants still speak [[German language|German]] fluently; and [[Oktoberfest of Blumenau|Oktoberfest]] continues to be celebrated in [[Blumenau]] and in many other towns in the region.  Architecture, too, shows German influence, as do popular customs and local cuisine.

===Italians===

[[File:Casanv.jpg|right|thumb|Stone house in [[Nova Veneza, Santa Catarina|Nova Veneza]], southern Santa Catarina, landmark of [[Italian People|Italian]] immigration.]]

Italian settlers started arriving in Santa Catarina in 1875 and immigrated in large numbers until the 1910s.  They were peasants from [[Northern Italy]] and established themselves in ethnically Italian colonies close to the coast.  In the beginning, Italian settlements failed, because many [[Italian people|Italians]] died of tropical diseases or left the colonies to find better conditions.  However, in the Vale do Tubarão region (southern Santa Catarina), Italian [[immigrant]]s found cooler weather and better lands, and the settlements prospered.  Many Italians worked in the coal [[Industry (economics)|industry]] and, unlike the [[Germans|German]] immigrants, they did not dedicate themselves very much to [[agriculture]].  As they were not isolated in rural colonies, Italian immigrants were quickly integrated into the Brazilian population of [[Portuguese-Brazilian|Portuguese]] descent that had been living in Brazil since the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Santa Catarina has one of the highest standards of living in [[Brazil]], and is a major industrial and agricultural center. The capital city, Florianópolis, has a diversified economy, being an important pole for the technology industry and a major touristic destination. Commerce and services are also very strong in the capital. Cities from Florianópolis metro area, like São José, Palhoça and Biguaçu are important and diverse industrial poles, as well as strong commerce areas. In the northeast of the state, electric-mechanical, textile and furniture industries are strong; in the west, cattle and poultry breeding predominate, while in the south it is ceramics and shellfish.The corridor between Joinville, Jaraguá do Sul and Blumenau is heavily industrialized - more than 50% of the state's industrial output is concentrated in this small, but highly developed area.

[[File:Macieiras.Bom.Jardim.da.Serra.SC.01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Apple trees in [[Bom Jardim da Serra]]]]
In agriculture, the state stands out in the production of [[rice]], [[apple]] and [[onion]], in addition to having an important production of [[soy]], [[maize]], [[banana]], [[grape]], [[garlic]], [[barley]], [[wheat]] and [[yerba mate]].

With only 1.12% of the national territory, Santa Catarina was the 8th largest producer of [[maize]] and the 11th largest producer of [[soybeans]] in Brazil, in the year 2017. But when taken into account the volume produced by area size, the State becomes national leader in corn, with an average of 8.1 thousand kilos per hectare, and the second placed in productivity in soybeans, with 3.580 kilos per hectare. In 15 years, there has been a 118% growth in corn productivity and 58% in soybean.<ref>[https://www.nsctotal.com.br/noticias/produtividade-de-milho-cresce-118-em-15-anos-em-sc Produtividade de milho cresce 118% em 15 anos em SC]</ref> In 2019, corn production in the state reached 2.8 million tons (in 2018 Brazil was the 3rd largest producer in the world, with 82 million tons.<ref>[https://www.bnb.gov.br/documents/1342439/3950249/172_22_10_2018.pdf/46367a39-443c-f5da-4b71-27cfbf04be25 Produção de Milho no Nordeste]</ref><ref>[https://cidadeverde.com/noticias/307537/producao-de-graos-cresce-14-e-piaui-se-consolida-como-3-maior-produtor-do-nordeste Produção de grãos cresce 14% e Piauí se consolida como 3º maior produtor do Nordeste]</ref> However, the annual demand for corn in the state is 7 million tons - 97% is for animal consumption, especially for the production of pigs and broilers (83.8%), as Santa Catarina is the largest pig producer state in Brazil and the second largest poultry .

Santa Catarina is one of the few states in the country that cultivates [[barley]]. In the 2007-2011 period, the state had 2.5% of national production. The cultivation was concentrated in the microregions of [[Canoinhas]] (57.6%), [[Curitibanos]] (26.5%) and [[Xanxerê]] (11.5%). It's also one of the few states that cultivates wheat, also due to the climatic factor. In 2019 the estimated production of the state was 150 thousand tons, still small compared to the 2.3 million tons produced by both Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná. Because the country has to import these 2 cereals in high volume every year, the State has been trying to stimulate the production of winter grain crops with incentive programs.<ref>[http://www.cnpt.embrapa.br/biblio/do/p_do139_4.htm A Cevada no Brasil]</ref><ref>[https://www.nsctotal.com.br/noticias/area-de-cultivo-de-trigo-em-sc-reduz-8-em-2019 Área de cultivo de trigo em SC reduz 8% em 2019]</ref><ref>[http://www.engeplus.com.br/noticia/santa-catarina/2020/santa-catarina-lanca-programa-de-incentivo-ao-plantio-de-graos-de-inverno Santa Catarina lança Programa de Incentivo ao Plantio de Grãos de Inverno]</ref>

[[File:Criciumaanoitecer.jpg|thumb|Sunset in [[Criciúma]].]]
Santa Catarina is the largest [[coal]] producer in Brazil, mainly in the city of [[Criciúma]] and surroundings. The production of crude mineral coal in Brazil was 13.6 million tons in 2007. Santa Catarina produced 8.7 Mt (million tons); Rio Grande do Sul, 4.5 Mt; and Paraná, 0.4 Mt. Despite the extraction of mineral coal in Brazil, the country still needs to import about 50% of the coal consumed, as the coal produced in the country is of low quality, as it has a lower concentration of carbon. Among the countries that supply Brazil with mineral coal is South Africa, USA and Australia. Mineral coal in Brazil supplies, in particular, thermoelectric plants that consume about 85% of production. The cement industry in the country, on the other hand, is supplied with approximately 6% of this coal, leaving 4% for the production of cellulose paper and only 5% in the food, ceramics and grains industries. Brazil has reserves of [[peat]], [[lignite]] and [[hard coal]]. Coal totals 32 billion tons of reserves and is mainly in Rio Grande do Sul (89.25% of the total), followed by Santa Catarina (10.41%). The Candiota Deposit (RS) alone has 38% of all national coal. As it is a coal of inferior quality, it is used only in the generation of thermoelectric energy and at the site of the deposit. The oil crisis in the 1970s led the Brazilian government to create the Energy Mobilization Plan, with intense research to discover new coal reserves. The Geological Survey of Brazil, through works carried out in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, greatly increased the reserves of coal previously known, between 1970 and 1986 (mainly between 1978 and 1983). Good quality coal, suitable for use in metallurgy and in large volume (seven billion tons), was then discovered in several deposits in Rio Grande do Sul (Morungava, Chico Lomã, Santa Teresinha), but at relatively great depths (up to 1,200 m), which has hindered its use until now. In 2011, coal accounted for only 5.6% of the energy consumed in Brazil, but it is an important strategic source, which can be activated when, for example, the water levels in the dams are very low, reducing excessively the supply of water. hydroelectric power. This happened in 2013, when several thermoelectric plants were then shut down, thus maintaining the necessary supply, albeit at a higher cost.<ref>[http://www.cprm.gov.br/publique/Redes-Institucionais/Rede-de-Bibliotecas---Rede-Ametista/Carvao-Mineral-2558.html Carvão Mineral]</ref><ref>[https://tecnicoemineracao.com.br/carvao-mineral-no-brasil-e-no-mundo/ Carvão mineral no Brasil e no mundo]</ref>

Brazil's participation in the world trade in textiles and clothing is only 0.3%, due to the difficulty of competing in price with producers in India and mainly in China. The gross value of production, which includes consumption of intermediate goods and services, by the Brazilian textile industry corresponded to almost R $ 40 billion in 2015, 1.6% of the gross value of Industrial Production in Brazil.

An interesting collaboration between men and Nature that can be watched has been developed in [[Laguna, Santa Catarina|Laguna]] (birthplace of [[Anita Garibaldi]], the wife and comrade-in-arms of [[Italian Unification]] revolutionary [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]): a pod of [[bottlenose dolphin]]s drive fish towards fishermen who stand at the beach in shallow waters. Then one dolphin rolls over, which the fishermen take as sign to throw out their nets. The dolphins feed on the escaping fish. The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration has been going on at least since 1847.<ref>''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (2006), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/southamerica/brazil/734722/Brazils-sexiest-secret.html "Brazil's sexiest secret"], article retrieved March 20, 2009.</ref><ref>Dr. Moti Nissani (2007) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECk0yMifmzw Bottlenose Dolphins in Laguna Requesting a Throw Net] (video).
