In 1969, [[Hillary Rodham]] wrote a 92-page senior [[thesis]] for [[Wellesley College]] about [[Community organizing|community organizer]] [[Saul Alinsky]] entitled ''"There Is Only the Fight&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;": An Analysis of the Alinsky Model''.<ref name=Kruse>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/hillary-clinton-2016-wellesley-president-214188|title=The First Time Hillary Clinton Was President|author=Kruse, Michael|date=August 26, 2016|publisher=[[Politico]] Magazine|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref>

While the work by Rodham as a college student was the subject of much speculation in articles and biographies of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 1990s, access to the thesis was limited by the college, at the request of the Clinton White House, during her time as first lady.

== Thesis ==
Rodham researched the thesis by interviewing Alinsky and others, and by conducting visits to low-income areas of Chicago (nearby to her hometown, [[Park Ridge, Illinois]]) and observing [[Community Action Program]]s in those areas.<ref>[[Carl Bernstein]], ''A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton''. Knopf, 2007, {{ISBN|0-375-40766-9}}, p. 57.</ref>  Her thesis adviser was Wellesley professor of political science [[Alan Schechter]].<ref name="dedman2" />

The thesis was sympathetic to Alinsky's critiques of government antipoverty programs, but criticized Alinsky's methods as largely ineffective, all the while describing Alinsky's personality as appealing.<ref name="dedman" /> The thesis sought to fit Alinsky into a line of American social activists, including [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Walt Whitman]]. Written in formal academic language, the thesis concluded that "[Alinsky's] power/conflict model is rendered inapplicable by existing social conflicts" and that Alinsky's model had not expanded nationally due to "the anachronistic nature of small autonomous conflict".<ref name="dedman" />

A 2007 ''[[New York Times]]'' review of Rodham's thesis summarized her views as follows: "Ms. Rodham endorsed Mr. Alinsky's central critique of government antipoverty programs — that they tended to be too top-down and removed from the wishes of individuals. But the student leader split with Mr. Alinsky over a central point. He vowed to 'rub raw the sores of discontent' and compel action through agitation. This, she believed, ran counter to the notion of change within the system."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/us/politics/05clinton.html|title=In Turmoil of '68, Clinton Found a New Voice|last=Leibovich|first=Mark|date=2007-09-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref> In 2016, reporter Michael Kruse quotes the thesis and describes a centrist theme:

{{quote|"Alinsky's conclusion that the 'ventilation' of hostilities is healthy in certain situations is valid, but across-the-board 'social catharsis' cannot be prescribed," she wrote. "Catharsis has a way of perpetuating itself so that it becomes an end in itself." She continued: "Interestingly, this society seems to be in a transition period, caught between conflict and consensus." It was clear where this 21-year-old stood: "... as our 'two societies'—the establishment, the anti-establishment—"move further apart contrived conflict serves to exacerbate the polarization.<ref name=Kruse/>}}

In the acknowledgements and end notes of the thesis, Rodham thanked Alinsky for two interviews and a job offer. She declined the latter, saying that "after spending a year trying to make sense out of [Alinsky's] inconsistency, I need three years of legal rigor." The thesis was praised by all four of its reviewers<ref name="wapo-common" /> and Rodham, an [[honors student]] at Wellesley, received an [[Grade (education)#United States|A grade]] on it.<ref name="dedman">[[Bill Dedman]], [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17388372/ns/politics-decision_08/t/reading-hillary-rodhams-hidden-thesis/#.XYwKbEZKhPY "Reading Hillary Rodham's hidden thesis: Clinton White House asked Wellesley College to close off access"], ''[[msnbc.com]]'', March 2, 2007.

== White House and Wellesley limiting of access ==
The work was unnoticed until Hillary Rodham Clinton entered the White House as first lady. Clinton researchers and political opponents sought it out, contending it contained evidence that Rodham had held strong [[far-left]] or [[socialist]] views.<ref name="dedman" />

In early 1993, the [[White House]] requested that Wellesley not release the thesis to anyone.<ref name="dedman" /> Wellesley complied, instituting a new rule that closed access to the thesis of any sitting U.S. president or First lady, a rule that in practice applied only to Rodham.<ref name="dedman2">[[Bill Dedman]], [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17388394/ns/politics-decision_08/t/how-clintons-wrapped-hillarys-thesis/#.XYwKq0ZKhPY "How the Clintons wrapped up Hillary's thesis: 'A stupid political decision,' says her former Wellesley poli-sci professor"], ''[[msnbc.com]]'', March 2, 2007. Accessed September 25, 2018.</ref> Biographer [[Donnie Radcliffe]] instead used extensive recollections from Schechter to describe the thesis in her biography published later that year, ''Hillary Rodham Clinton : A First Lady for Our Time''.<ref>[[Donnie Radcliffe]], ''Hillary Rodham Clinton : A First Lady for Our Time''. Warner Books, 1993, {{ISBN|0-446-51766-6}}, p. 77.</ref> [[David Brock]] was similarly unable to access the thesis for his book ''The Seduction of Hillary Rodham'' (1996), writing that it was "under lock and key". Instead, he, too, used some of Schechter's recollections.<ref>[[David Brock]], ''The Seduction of Hillary Rodham''. Free Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-684-83451-0}}, p. 17.</ref>  By the mid-1990s, Clinton critics seized upon the restricted access as a sure sign that the thesis held politically explosive contents that would reveal her hidden radicalism or extremism.<ref name="bg030407">Michael Levenson, [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/03/04/a_students_words_a_candidates_struggle/ "A student's words, a candidate's struggle"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', March 4, 2007.

Syndicated columnists [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] and Jan Moller tried to gain access in 1999, but they were rebuffed by both Wellesley and the White House.<ref name=WashMerry-Go-Round1>[[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]]  and Jan Moller, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&dat=19990308&id=6XchAAAAIBAJ&sjid=n4kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1831,1025065&hl=en "Hillary's College Thesis Off-limits"], ''Washington Merry-Go-Round'', United Features Syndicate, ''[[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]]'' (Norwalk, Connecticut), March 9, 1999, page A12.</ref> Writing in their "[[Washington Merry-Go-Round]]" column, they surmised that the thesis's conclusion might be at variance with [[Clinton Administration]] policies, saying they had "discovered the subject of her thesis: a criticism of Lyndon B. Johnson's 'War on Poverty' programs. Mrs. Clinton's conclusion? Community-based anti-poverty programs don't work."<ref name=WashMerry-Go-Round1 />  Clinton [[biographer]] [[Barbara Olson]] wrote in her 1999 book ''Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton'' that, "The contents of Hillary's thesis, and why she would want it hidden from public view, have long been the subject of intense interest. Most likely, she does not want the American people to know the extent to which she internalized and assimilated the beliefs and methods of Saul Alinsky."<ref>[[Barbara Olson]],  ''Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton''. Regnery Publishing, 1999, {{ISBN|0-89526-197-9}}, pp. 45–46.</ref>

In her memoir ''[[Living History (book)|Living History]]'' (2003), Clinton mentioned the thesis only briefly, saying she had agreed with some of Alinsky's ideas but had not agreed with his belief that it was impossible to "change the system" from inside.<ref name="LH">[[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]], ''[[Living History (book)|Living History]]''. Simon & Schuster, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7432-2224-5}}, p. 38.</ref>

Years after the Clintons left the White House, the thesis still held its allure.<ref name="dedman" /> For example, in 2005, columnist [[Peggy Noonan]] speculated that it was "the [[Rosetta Stone]]" of Hillary biographies defining "how to change the American political culture".<ref>[[Peggy Noonan]], [http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006855 "Eine Kleine Biographie"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', June 23, 2005. Accessed March 3, 2007.</ref> Clinton staffers still did not discuss why it had been sealed.<ref name="wapo-common" />

== Thesis made available ==
The thesis was made available after the Clintons left the White House in 2001 by the Wellesley College archives. It first received public exposure in 2005 when [[NBC News]] investigative reporter [[Bill Dedman]] sent his journalism class from [[Boston University]] to read the thesis and write articles about it, and one of the students, Rick Heller, posted his article online that December.<ref>Rick Heller, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110614022102/http://www.centristcoalition.com/blog/archives/002771.html "Hillary Clinton's Bachelor's Thesis"], Centerfield Blog, December 19, 2005. Accessed July 9, 2008. Archived June 14, 2011.</ref> The thesis is also available through interlibrary loan on microfilm, a method reporter Dorian Davis used when he obtained it in January 2007, and sent it to Noonan and to [[Amanda Carpenter]] at ''[[Human Events]]'', who wrote a piece<ref>[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=19734 "Hillary's Wellesley Thesis Shows Want of An Enemy"], ''[[Human Events]]'', March 9, 2007</ref> on it in March.

The suppression of the thesis from 1993 to 2001 at the request of the Clinton White House was documented in March 2007 by reporter Dedman, who read the thesis at the Wellesley library and interviewed Rodham's thesis adviser. Dedman found that the thesis did not disclose much of Rodham's own views.<ref name="dedman" /> A ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'' assessment found the thesis nuanced, and said that "While [Rodham] defends Alinsky, she is also dispassionate, disappointed, and amused by his divisive methods and dogmatic ideology."<ref name="bg030407" /> Schechter told Dedman, writing for [[msnbc.com]], that ''"There Is Only The Fight&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."'' was a good thesis, and that its suppression by the Clinton White House "was a stupid political decision, obviously, at the time."<ref name="dedman2" />

Interest in the thesis and in Clinton's relationship with Alinsky continued during the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], as Clinton battled Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]], who had also been reported to have been exposed to Alinsky-style ideas and methods during his time as a Chicago community organizer.<ref name="wapo-common">Peter Slevin, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/24/AR2007032401152.html "For Clinton and Obama, a Common Ideological Touchstone"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', March 25, 2007.
