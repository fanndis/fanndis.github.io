'''''Fox News Sunday''''' is a [[Sunday morning talk show]] airing on the broadcast [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network since 1996, as a presentation of [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]]. It is the only regularly scheduled Fox News program carried on the main Fox broadcast network.

==Overview==
The program began on April 28, 1996,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weprin |first1=Alex |title=Obama to make first appearance on 'Fox News Sunday' since becoming president |url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/04/barack-obama-fox-news-sunday-interview-chris-wallace-221632 |website=politico.com |publisher=Politico, LLC. |accessdate=12 June 2020}}</ref> 5½ months prior to the launch of the network's sister cable news network  [[Fox News Channel]]. When the show originally launched, there was no studio, it aired from historic locations in the Washington DC area. The show was the first network news show to stream live on the Internet. The show was also the first to incorporate live user commentary. Users posted on an Internet BBS and the Internet Producer moderated by choosing and posting the comments in the screen's lower third. The show airs live at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], although many Fox stations can choose to broadcast it at a later time slot. For example, due to voluminous [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] pre-game and [[E/I]] requirements in the [[2017 NFL season]], [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] in [[Milwaukee]] has carried it in the past in Sunday late night. The program is also rebroadcast on Fox News Channel the same day at 2:00 and 7:00&nbsp;p.m. ET.<ref>{{cite web |title=TV Schedule for Fox News |url=https://www.tvpassport.com/tv-listings/stations/fox-news/1083/2020-06-14 |website=tvpassport.com |publisher=TV Passport |accessdate=12 June 2020}}</ref>

The show was hosted by [[Tony Snow]] until 2003, when he left to become [[White House Press Secretary]] under [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Tony Snow: Former Assistant to the President and White House Press Secretary |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/tonysnow-bio.html |website=whitehouse.gov |accessdate=12 June 2020}}</ref> It has been hosted by [[Chris Wallace]] since 2003.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Malone |first1=Michael |title=Chris Wallace’s Sunday Best |url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/chris-wallaces-sunday-best |website=multichannel.com |publisher=Future Publishing Limited Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA. |accessdate=12 June 2020}}</ref>

An audio-only broadcast of the program is also carried on a number of radio stations. Most of these stations are owned by [[iHeartMedia]] (the former Clear Channel Communications), the largest radio station group that runs the division's [[Fox News Radio]] newscasts, along with [[WCSP-FM]] ([[C-SPAN]] Radio) in the Washington area and over the Internet, as part of its weekly audio airings of the major Sunday morning talk shows. In August 2008, ''Fox News Sunday'' began to be produced in [[high-definition television|high definition]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvpredictions.com/newssunday042008.htm |title=Fox News Sunday Going HD In August<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430155933/http://www.tvpredictions.com/newssunday042008.htm |archive-date=2008-04-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The first minute or so of the broadcast runs down the day's headlines, since Fox, unlike the [[Big Three television networks]], does not have a conventional national [[breakfast television|morning news program]] that leads into ''Fox News Sunday'', though a limited amount of Fox's affiliates have [[local news]] programs leading into it. For the rest of the first half of the show, Wallace interviews news makers from the prior week.

During the second half of the show, Wallace introduces a panel of four pundits to speak about the political impact of the news. Regular members of the panel include [[Brit Hume]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Brit Hume |url=https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/brit-hume |website=foxnews.com |publisher=Fox News Network, LLC. |accessdate=15 June 2020}}</ref> [[NPR|National Public Radio]] correspondent [[Mara Liasson]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Mara Liasson |url=https://www.foxnews.com/person/l/mara-liasson |website=foxnews.com |publisher=Fox News Network, LLC. |accessdate=15 June 2020}}</ref> and [[The Hill (newspaper)|the Hill]] columnist [[Juan Williams]];<ref>{{cite web |title=Juan Williams |url=https://www.foxnews.com/person/w/juan-williams |website=foxnews.com |publisher=Fox News Network, LLC. |accessdate=15 June 2020}}</ref> [[Stephen F. Hayes]] and [[Fred Barnes (journalist)|Fred Barnes]] of the ''Weekly Standard'', [[Associated Press]] White House reporter Julie Pace, columnists [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] and [[George Will]], ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' Washington bureau chief [[Nina Easton]], [[Fox News]] Washington deputy managing editor [[Bill Sammon]], former [[state department]] official [[Liz Cheney]], former Clinton chief of staff [[John Podesta]], former [[White House]] [[Press Secretary]] [[Dana Perino]], [[USA Today]] columnist [[Kirsten Powers]], radio host [[Laura Ingraham]], [[Roll Call]] columnist [[Mort Kondracke]], ''[[Washington Examiner]]'' reporter [[Byron York]] and ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter Ceci Connelly also appear on the panel on a limited basis.

The program ends with a short segment focusing on a "Power Player of the Week", usually a short, non-political "feel-good" story.<ref>{{cite web |title=Power Player of the Week |url=https://video.foxnews.com/playlist/fox-news-sunday-power-player-of-the-week/ |website=foxnews.com |publisher=FOX News Network, LLC. |accessdate=3 November 2020}}</ref>
