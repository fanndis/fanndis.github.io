'''Charter schools in the United States''' are [[Primary education in the United States|primary]] or [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary education]] institutions that do not charge fees to pupils who take state-mandated exams. These [[charter school]]s are subject to fewer rules, regulations, and statutes than traditional state schools, but receive less public funding than [[State school|public schools]], typically a fixed amount per pupil. There are both non-profit and for-profit charter schools, and only non-profit charters can receive donations from private sources.<ref>{{cite web

As of 2016-2017 there were an estimated 6,900 public charter schools in 42 states and the District of Columbia (2016–17) with approximately 3.1 million students, a sixfold increase in enrollment over the past 15 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=EER report|url=http://www.publiccharters.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/EER_Report_V5.pdf|accessdate=10 January 2017}}</ref> In 2015 alone, more than 400 new charter schools opened while 270 schools closed due to low enrollment, lack of finances or low performance.<ref name="EnrollmentGrowth2015">{{cite web | url=http://www.publiccharters.org/press/new-closed-report/ | title=Charter Public Schools Serving 250,000 New Students in 2015-16 | publisher=National Alliance for Public Charter Schools | work=Website | date=3 February 2016 | accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref> Waiting lists grew from an average of 233 in 2009 to 277 in 2012,{{sfn|Rebarber|Zgainer|2014|pp=2–3}} with places allocated by a [[lottery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calcharters.org/understanding/|title=Understanding Charters :: California Charter Schools Association<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=October 15, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231120613/http://www.calcharters.org/understanding/|archive-date=December 31, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> They educate the majority of children in [[New Orleans Public Schools]].<ref name="The Times-Picayune 2009">''RSD looks at making charters pay rent'', The Times-Picayune, December 18, 2009.</ref> Some charter schools provide a specialized [[curriculum]] (for example in arts, mathematics, or vocational training).

== History ==

The charter school idea in the United States was originated in 1974 by Ray Budde,<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> a professor at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. [[Albert Shanker]], President of the [[American Federation of Teachers]], embraced the concept in 1988, when he called for the reform of the public schools by establishing "charter schools" or "schools of choice."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/opinion/sunday/albert-shanker-the-original-charter-school-visionary.html The Original Charter School Vision], By Richard D. Kahlenberg and Halley Potter, ''The New York Times'', Aug. 30, 2014</ref> [[Gloria Ladson-Billings]] called him "the first person to publicly propose charter schools."{{sfn|Carter|Welner|2013}} At the time, a few schools already existed that were not called charter schools but embodied some of their principles, such as [[H-B Woodlawn]].

As originally conceived, the ideal model of a charter school was as a legally and financially autonomous [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] (without tuition, religious affiliation, or selective student admissions) that would operate much like a private business—free from many state laws and district regulations, and accountable more for student outcomes rather than for processes or inputs (such as [[Carnegie Unit and Student Hour|Carnegie Units]] and teacher certification requirements).

[[Minnesota]] was the first state to pass a charter school law in 1991. [[California]] was second, in 1992. {{As of|2015}}, 43 states and the [[District of Columbia]] have charter school laws, according to the Center for Education Reform.<ref>{{cite web

As of 2012, an authorizer other than a local school board has granted over 60 percent of charters across the country. Between 2009 and 2012, the percent of charter schools implementing performance-based compensation increased from 19 percent to 37 percent, while the proportion that is unionized decreased from 12 percent to 7 percent. The most popular educational focus is college preparation (30 percent), while 8 percent focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Another 16 percent emphasize Core Knowledge. Blended Learning (6 percent) and Virtual/Online learning (2 percent) are in use. When compared to traditional public schools, charters serve a more disadvantaged student population, including more low-income and minority students. Sixty-one percent of charter schools serve a student population where over 60 percent qualify for the federal Free or Reduced Lunch Program. Charter schools receive an average 36 percent less revenue per student than traditional public schools, and receive no facilities funds. The number of charters providing a longer school day grew from 23 percent in 2009 to 48 percent in 2012.{{sfn|Rebarber|Zgainer|2014|p=3}}

== General structure and characteristics ==
The rules and structure of charter schools depend on state authorizing legislation and differ from state to state.  A charter school is authorized to function once it has received a [[charter]], a statutorily defined performance [[contract]] detailing the school's mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3–5 years.

=== Accountability for student achievement ===

Charter schools are accountable for student achievement to their sponsor — a local [[school board]], state education agency, university, or other entity — for producing positive [[academic]] results and adhere to the charter contract. While this accountability is one of the key arguments in favor of charters, evidence gathered by the [[United States Department of Education]] suggests that charter schools may not, in practice, be held to higher standards of accountability than traditional public schools. Typically, these schools are allowed to remain open, perhaps with new leadership or restructuring, or perhaps with no change at all. Charter school proponents assert that charter schools are not given the opportunities to restructure often and are simply closed down when students perform poorly on these assessments.<ref name="USDEexec"/>  {{As of|2009|March}}, 12.5% of the over 5000 charter schools founded in the United States had closed for reasons including academic, financial, and managerial problems, and occasionally consolidation or district interference.<ref name="Center for Education Reform">{{cite press release|title=Accountability Lies at the Heart of Charter School Success |first1=Jeanne |last1=Allen |publisher=Center for Education Reform |date=March 2009 |url=http://www.edreform.com/Press_Box/Press_Releases/?Accountability_Lies_at_the_Heart_of_Charter_School_Success&year=2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917052643/http://www.edreform.com/Press_Box/Press_Releases/?Accountability_Lies_at_the_Heart_of_Charter_School_Success&year=2009 |archivedate=September 17, 2009 }}</ref> A 2013 Study by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) at [[Stanford University]] institute linked overall improvement of the charter school sector to charter school closures, suggesting that charter schools as a whole are not getting better, but the closure of bad schools is improving the system as a whole.<ref name="credo13" />

Many charter schools are created with the original intent of providing a unique and innovative educational experience to its students. However, charter schools are still held accountable for test scores, state mandates, and other traditional requirements that often have the effect of turning the charter school into a similar model and design as the public schools.<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref>

Although the U.S. Department of Education's findings agree with those of the [[National Education Association]] (NEA), their study points out the limitations of such studies and the inability to hold constant other important factors, and notes that "study design does not allow us to determine whether or not traditional public schools are more effective than charter schools."<ref name=USDEexec>{{cite web

=== Chartering authorities ===

Chartering authorizers, entities that may legally issue charters, differ from state to state, as do the bodies that are legally entitled to apply for and operate under such charters. In some states, like [[Arkansas]], the State Board of Education authorizes charters. In other states, like [[Maryland]], only the local school district may issue charters. Some school districts may authorize charter schools as part of a larger program for systemic improvement, such as the [[Portfolio strategy]]. States including [[Arizona]] and the [[District of Columbia]] have created independent charter-authorizing bodies to which applicants may apply for a charter. The laws that permit the most charter development, as seen in [[Minnesota]] and [[Michigan]], allow for a combination of such authorizers. As of 2012, 39% of charters were authorized by local districts, 28% by state boards of education, 12% by State Commissions, with the remainder by Universities, Cities and others.{{sfn|Rebarber|Zgainer|2014|p=7}}

=== Caps ===
Andrew Rotherham, co-founder of Education Sector and opponent of charter school caps, has written, "One might be willing to accept this pent-up demand if charter school caps, or the debate over them, were addressing the greater concern of charter school quality. But this is not the case. Statutory caps as they exist now are too blunt a policy instrument to sufficiently address quality. They fail to differentiate between good schools and lousy schools and between successful charter school authorizers and those with a poor track record of running charter schools. And, all the while, they limit public schooling options and choices for parents."<ref>{{cite web |last=Rotherham |first=Andrew |url=http://www.educationsector.org/analysis/analysis_show.htm?doc_id=532967 |title=Smart Charter School Caps |date=September 2007 |publisher=educationsector.org |access-date=August 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820201541/http://www.educationsector.org/analysis/analysis_show.htm?doc_id=532967 |archive-date=August 20, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Demographics ===

The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education's]] 1997 First Year Report, part of a four-year national study on charters, was based on interviews of 225 charter schools in 10 states. The report found charters tended to be small (fewer than 200 students) and represented primarily new schools, though some schools had converted to charter status. Charter schools often tended to exist in urban locations, rather than rural. This study also found enormous variation among states. Charter schools tended to be somewhat more racially diverse, and to enroll slightly fewer students with special needs or limited English proficiency than the average schools in their state.<ref name=FYR>{{cite web

}}</ref>

=== Funding ===

Charter school funding is dictated by each state.  In many states, charter schools are funded by transferring per-pupil state aid from the school district where the charter school student resides. Charters on average receive less money per-pupil than the corresponding public schools in their areas, though the average figure is controversial because some charter schools do not enroll a proportionate number of students that require special education or student support services. Additionally, some charters are not required to provide transportation and nutrition services.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>
The Federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Part B, Sections 502–511 authorizes funding grants for charter schools.

In August 2005, the Thomas B. Fordam Institute, a pro-charter group, published a national report of charter school finance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edexcellence.net/doc/Charter%20School%20Funding%202005%20FINAL.pdf |title=Charter School Funding: Inequity's Next Frontier |publisher=Thomas B.

For a typical charter school of 250 students, that amounts to about $450,000 per year. The study asserts that the funding gap is wider in most of twenty-seven urban school districts studied, where it amounts to $2,200 per student, and that in cities like San Diego and Atlanta, charters receive 40% less than traditional public schools. The funding gap was largest in South Carolina, California, Ohio, Georgia, Wisconsin and Missouri. The report suggests that the primary driver of the district-charter funding gap is charter schools' lack of access to local and capital funding.

A 2010 study found that charters received 64 percent of their district counterparts, averaging $7,131 per pupil compared to the average per pupil expenditure of $11,184 in the traditional public schools in 2009/10{{sfn|Rebarber|Zgainer|2014|p=9}} compared to $10,771 per pupil at conventional district public schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/|title=National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Home Page, part of the U.S. Department of Education|website=nces.ed.gov}}</ref> Charters raise an average of some $500 per student in additional revenue from donors.{{sfn|Rebarber|Zgainer|2014|p=10}}

However, funding differences across districts remain considerable in most states that use local property taxes for revenue. Charters that are funded based on a statewide average may have an advantage if they are located in a low-income district, or be at a disadvantage if located in a high-income district.<ref>{{cite journal

===Virtual charter schools===

In November 2015, the first major study into online charter schools in the United States, the National Study of Online Charter Schools, was published. It found "significantly weaker academic performance" in maths and reading in such schools when they were compared to conventional ones. The study was the result of research carried out in 17 US states which had online charter schools, and was conducted by researchers from the [[University of Washington]], Stanford University and [[Mathematica Policy Research]]. It concluded that keeping online pupils focused on their work was the biggest problem faced by online charter schools, and that in mathematics the difference in attainment between online pupils and their conventionally educated peers equated to the cyber pupils missing a whole academic year in school.<ref name="BBC News Online 4 November 2015">{{cite news |last= Coughlan |first= Sean |title= Online schools 'worse than traditional teachers'|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34671952| date= 4 November 2015|website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 4 November 2015}}</ref>

=== Center for Education Reform ranking ===
Current laws have been characterized as either "strong" or "weak." "Strong-law" states mandate considerable autonomy from local labor-management agreements and bureaucracy, allow a significant number of charter schools to be authorized by multiple charter-granting agencies, and allocate a level of funding consistent with the statewide per pupil average. According to the Center for Education Reform, a pro-charter group, in 2015 the [[District of Columbia]], [[Michigan]], [[Indiana]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Arizona]] had the "strongest" laws in the nation. [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]] and [[Kansas]] are home to the nation's "weakest" laws, according to the same ranking.<ref>{{cite press release | title=Charter School Laws Across the States 2015 |publisher=[[Center for Education Reform]] |url=https://www.edreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CharterLaws2015.pdf |date=March 2015 |accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref>

== National evaluations ==

Multiple researchers and organizations have examined educational outcomes for students who attend charter schools. In general, urban charter schools may appear to be a good alternative to traditional urban schools for urban minority students in poor neighborhoods, if one looks strictly at test scores, but students in suburban charter schools do no better than those in traditional suburban schools serving a mostly middle-class white population.<ref name=NYT112015>{{cite news|author1=Susan Dynarski|title=Urban Charter Schools Often Succeed.

But they have been shown to improve the education of disadvantaged children at scale, in multiple cities, over many years.}}</ref>

=== Center for Research on Education Outcomes ===
CREDO studies charter schools and has completed two national reports for 2009 and 2013.  The report is the first detailed national assessment of charter schools. The reports analyze the impact of charter schools in 26 states and find a steady improvement in charter school quality since 2009.

The authors state, "On average, students attending charter schools have eight additional days of learning in reading and the same days of learning in math per year compared to their peers in traditional public schools."<ref name=credo13>{{cite report|title=2013 CREDO Stanford study |page=3 |year=2013 |url=http://credo.stanford.edu/documents/NCSS%202013%20Final%20Draft.pdf}}</ref> Charter schools also have varying impacts on different demographic groups. Black students in charters get an extra 7 days of learning in reading.<ref name=credo13/>{{rp|32}} For low-income charter school students the advantage is 14 days of extra learning in reading and 22 days in math.<ref name=credo13/>{{rp|36–37}} English Language Learner students in charter schools see a 43-day learning advantage over traditional public school students in reading and an extra 36 days advantage in math.<ref name=credo13/>{{rp|38}}

Charter schools showed a significantly greater variation in quality between states and within states. For example, Arizona charter school students had a 29-day disadvantage in math compared to public school students but charter school students in D.C. had a 105-day advantage over their peers in public schools.<ref name=credo13/>{{rp|52}} While the obvious solution to the widely varying quality of charter schools would be to close those that perform below the level of public schools, this is hard to accomplish in practice as even a poor school has its supporters.<ref name=credo/>

==== Criticism and debate ====

Stanford economist [[Caroline Hoxby]] criticized the study, resulting in a written debate with the authors. She originally argued the study "contains a serious statistical mistake that causes a negative bias in its estimate of how charter schools affect achievement,"<ref>[http://credo.stanford.edu/reports/Memo_On_The_Credo_Study.pdf "A Serious Statistical Mistake In The CREDO Study of Charter Schools"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802101120/http://credo.stanford.edu/reports/Memo_On_The_Credo_Study.pdf |date=August 2, 2010 }}</ref> but after CREDO countered the remarks, saying Hoxby's "memo is riddled with serious errors"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://credo.stanford.edu/reports/CREDO_Hoxby_Rebuttal.pdf|title=Fact vs. Fiction: An Analysis of Dr. Hoxby's Misrepresentation of CREDO's Research|publisher=}}</ref> Hoxby revised her original criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://credo.stanford.edu/reports/memo_on_the_credo_study%20II.pdf|title=A Statistical Mistake In The CREDO Study of Charter Schools|publisher=}}</ref> The debate ended with a written "Finale" by CREDO that rebuts both Hoxby's original and revised criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://credo.stanford.edu/reports/CREDO%20Finale%20to%20Hoxby.pdf|title=CREDO Finale to Hoxby's Revised Memorandum|publisher=}}</ref>

The National Education Policy Center has criticized the methods that CREDO has used in its studies.  They criticized the CREDO studies for: "over-interpreting small effect sizes; failing to justify the statistical assumptions underlying the group comparisons made; not taking into account or acknowledging the large body of charter school research beyond CREDO's own work; ignoring the limitations inherent in the research approach they have taken, or at least failing to clearly communicate limitations to readers."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nepc.colorado.edu/newsletter/2017/09/credo-report-fails|title=CREDO Report Fails to Build Upon Prior Research in Creating Charter School Classification System|publisher=}}</ref>

=== National Bureau of Economic Research study ===

In 2004, the National Bureau of Economic Research found data that suggested Charter Schools increase competition in a given jurisdiction, thus improving the quality of traditional public schools (noncharters) in the area. Using end-of-year test scores for grades three through eight from North Carolina's state testing program, researchers found that charter school competition raised the composite test scores in district schools, even though the students leaving district schools for the charters tended to have above average test scores. The introduction of charter schools in the state caused an approximate one percent increase in the score, which constitutes about one quarter of the average yearly growth. The gain was roughly two to five times greater than the gain from decreasing the student-faculty ratio by 1. This research could partially explain how other studies have found a small significant difference in comparing educational outcomes between charter and traditional public schools. It may be that in some cases, charter schools actually improve other public schools by raising educational standards in the area.<ref>{{cite journal

It also reported that the longer the charter school had been in operation, the more favorably its students compared.

==== Criticism ====

The paper was the subject of controversy in 2005 when Princeton assistant professor Jesse Rothstein was unable to replicate her results. Hoxby's methodology in this study has also been criticized, arguing that Hoxby's "assessment of school outcomes is based on the share of students who are proficient at reading or math but not the average test score of the students. That's like knowing the poverty rate but not the average income of a community—useful but incomplete."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Schoolhouse Schlock: Conservatives flip-flop on standards for charter school research |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=8638 |first=Lawrence |last=Mishel |magazine=[[The American Prospect]] |date=September 23, 2004 |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113192918/http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=8638 |archivedate=November 13, 2007 }}</ref> How representative the study is has also been criticized, as the study is only of students in Chicago.<ref name="contexts">Renzulli, Linda A., & Roscigno, Vincent J., ''Charter Schools and the Public Good'', in ''Contexts'', '''6'''(1):31–36 (Winter 2007 {{doi|10.1525/ctx.2007.6.1.31}}, accessed January 3, 2008 (author Linda A.

=== Learning gains studies ===

A common approach in education evaluation research is to compare the learning gains of individual students in charter schools to their gains when they were in traditional public schools.  Thus, in effect, each student acts as his/her own control to assess the impact of charter schools.  A few selected examples of this work find that charter schools on average outperform the traditional public schools that supplied students, at least after the charter school had been in operation for a few years.  A possible limitation of this type of study is that it does not automatically distinguish between possible benefits of how the school operates (e.g. school structure) and possible peer effects, that is, effects of students on each other.<ref>{{cite journal

Twelve of these find that overall gains in charter schools were larger than other public schools; four find charter schools' gains higher in certain significant categories of schools, such as elementary schools, high schools, or schools serving at risk students; six find comparable gains in charter and traditional public schools; and, four find that charter schools' overall gains lagged behind. The study also looks at whether individual charter schools improve their performance with age (e.g. after overcoming start-up challenges). Of these, five of seven studies find that as charter schools mature, they improve. The other two find no significant differences between older and younger charter schools.

A more recent synthesis of findings conducted by Vanderbilt University indicates that solid conclusions cannot be drawn from the existing studies, due to their methodological shortcomings and conflicting results, and proposes standards for future meta-analyses.<ref name=Vanderbilt>{{cite web

The report performed analyses using both statistical controls and using pilot and charter applicant lotteries.

The results using statistical controls to control for demographic and baseline state test scores found a positive effect among charter schools similar to a year spent in one of Boston's selective exam schools, with math scores, for instance, showing positive effects of 0.18 and 0.22 standard deviations for charter middle and high schools respectively compared to an effect of 0.20 and 0.16 standard deviations for exam schools.  For pilot schools, the report found that in the middle school grades pilot school students modestly underperform relative to similar students attending traditional BPS schools (-0.05 standard deviations in ELA and -0.07 in math) while showing slightly positive results in the high school grades for pilot schools (0.15 standard deviations for writing and 0.06 for math).

The results using a sub-sample of schools with random lottery results found very large positive effects in both math and ELA scores for charter schools, including 0.16 and 0.19 standard deviations in middle and high school ELA scores respectively and 0.36 and 0.17 standard deviations in middle and high school math scores respectively.  Boston's pilot schools, however, showed a concerning negative effect in middle school math and ELA and a slightly positive effect in high school.

=== Los Angeles ===
CREDO evaluated the impact of charter schools in Los Angeles from 2008 to 2012.<ref name="credo2">{{cite web|url=https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/Los_Angeles_report_2014_FINAL_001.pdf|title=Charter School Performance in Los Angeles 2/26/2014|date=2014|website=|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=|author=CREDO}}</ref> The study found that over 48% of Los Angeles charters outperform local public schools in reading and 44% percent of Los Angeles charters outperform local public schools in math.

=== New Orleans ===

A 2010 case study by the [[Harvard Business School]] examined the charter school reform efforts in [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> Following Hurricane Katrina, the district became composed of 70 [[Recovery School District]] (RSD) schools managed by the state (including 37 RSD charter schools) and 16 schools managed by the local Orleans Parish School Board (OPSB) (including 12 OPSB charter schools). Charter schools now account for more than 60% of the public schools in New Orleans. RSD Schools were a result of Act 9 of the Louisiana State Legislature passed in 2003 to manage under-performing schools throughout the state.

When evaluating New Orleans' schools against the 200-point index called the State Performance Index (SPI),19 of the 20 highest-performing non-selective schools were charter schools. Charter schools affiliated with charter management organizations such as [[Knowledge Is Power Program|KIPP]] tended to perform better than stand-alone schools. The overall percentage of schools performing below the failing mark of 60 fell from 64% in 2005 to 36% in 2009.

A 2015 study contends that although charter schools may seem to be improving the system overall, these metrics do not take into account race, as many of the underperforming charters primarily educate African-American students.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Color of Reform|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|volume=21|issue=3|pages=288–299|doi=10.1177/1077800414557826|year=2015|last1=Dixson|first1=Adrienne D.|last2=Buras|first2=Kristen L.|last3=Jeffers|first3=Elizabeth K.|s2cid=143511260}}</ref> It offers significant concern that current metrics for evaluation are ignoring significant portions of the population and that the media is not taking this into account when considering the impact of charter schools on New Orleans.

== Policy and practice ==

As more states start charter schools, there is increasing speculation about upcoming legislation.  In an innovation-diffusion study surveying education policy experts in fifty states, Michael Mintrom and Sandra Vergari (1997) found that charter legislation is more likely to be considered in states with poor test scores, Republican legislative control, and proximity to other states with high quality charter schools. Legislative enthusiasm, gubernatorial support, interactions with national authorities, and use of permissive charter-law models increase the chances for adopting what they consider stronger laws. He feels union support and restrictive models lead to adoption of what he considers weaker laws. Other barriers to charter expansion include restrictions on the number of charters permissible in a state, lack of state and local funding for facilities and transportation, and a political and philanthropic focus on expanding charters in urban areas rather than in suburban or rural areas.<ref>https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/research/charter-school-deserts-high-poverty-neighborhoods-limited-educational-options</ref><ref>https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/research/americas-best-and-worst-cities-school-choice</ref>

The threat of vouchers, wavering support for public education, and bipartisan support for charters has led some unions to start charters themselves. Several [[American Federation of Teachers|AFT]] chapters, such as those in Houston and Dallas, have themselves started charters. In New York City, the United Federation of Teachers operates a charter school serving grades 9–12 in Brooklyn, NY.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theuftcharterschool.org/about/history/|website=UFT Charter School|accessdate=|title=The UFT Charter School : History}}</ref>  The [[National Education Association]] has allocated $1.5 million to help members start charter schools. Proponents claim that charters offer teachers a measure of empowerment, employee ownership, and governance that might be enhanced by union assistance (Nathan). Former President Bush's [[No Child Left Behind Act]] also promotes charter schools.

Over two dozen private management companies are scrambling to increase their 10 percent share of a "more hospitable and entrepreneurial market" (Stecklow 1997). In the late 1990s Boston-based Advantage Schools Inc., a corporation specializing in [[for-profit schooling]], has contracted to run charter schools in New Jersey, Arizona, and North Carolina. In July 2001, Advantage Schools, Inc. was acquired by [[Mosaica Education]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bloomberg News|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=24394}}</ref> The Education Development Corporation was planning in the summer of 1997 to manage nine nonsectarian charter schools in [[Michigan]], using cost-cutting measures employed in [[Christian schools]].

Charter schools provide an alternative for educators, families, and communities who are dissatisfied with educational quality and school district bureaucracies at noncharter schools. In early 2008, the [[EdChoice|Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice]], a pro-charter organization, conducted two polls in primarily conservative states Idaho and Nevada where they asked parents about their preferences concerning education. In Idaho, only 12% of respondents said that their regular public school was their top choice for the children's school.  Most preferred private schools over other options.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/research/ShowResearchItem.do?id=10093 |title=Idaho's Opinion on K–12 Education and School Choice |date=March 28, 2008 |first=Paul |last=DiPerna |publisher=Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice |accessdate=July 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705133359/http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/research/ShowResearchItem.do?id=10093 |archivedate=July 5, 2009 }}</ref>  In 2008, polls conducted in the conservative states Georgia<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.edreform.com/Archive/?New_Poll_Shows_Georgians_Want_More_Educational_Choice |title=New Poll Shows Georgians Want More Educational Choice |date=January 28, 2008 |publisher=Center for Education Reform |accessdate=July 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727134034/http://www.edreform.com/Archive/?New_Poll_Shows_Georgians_Want_More_Educational_Choice |archivedate=July 27, 2009 }}</ref> and Wyoming<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.edreform.com/Press_Box/Press_Releases/?Wyomingites_Want_Fundamental_Change_in_States_Charter_School_Law&year=2008 |title=Wyomingites Want Fundamental Change in State's Charter School Law |date=February 14, 2008 |publisher=Center for Education Reform |accessdate=July 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727134004/http://www.edreform.com/Press_Box/Press_Releases/?Wyomingites_Want_Fundamental_Change_in_States_Charter_School_Law&year=2008 |archivedate=July 27, 2009 }}</ref> found similar results.

The charter approach uses market principles from the private sector, including accountability and consumer choice, to offer new public sector options that remain nonsectarian and non-exclusive. Many people, such as former President Bill Clinton, see charter schools, with their emphasis on autonomy and accountability, as a workable political compromise and an alternative to vouchers.  Others, such as former President [[George W. Bush]], see charter schools as a way to improve schools without antagonizing the [[National Education Association|teachers' union]]. Bush made charter schools a major part of his [[No Child Left Behind Act]].  Despite these endorsements, a recent report by the [[American Federation of Teachers|AFT]] has shown charter schools not faring as well as public schools on state administered standardized testing,<ref name=AFT>{{cite journal

Both charter school proponents and critics admit that individual schools of public choice have the potential to develop into successful or unsuccessful models.

}}</ref> author Erin Dillon argues that market forces alone will not provide the necessary supply and demand for excellent public schools, especially in low-income, urban neighborhoods that often witness low student achievement.  According to Dillon, "In order to pressure all public schools to improve and to raise student achievement overall, school choice reforms need to not just increase the supply of any schools. They need to increase the supply of good schools, and parents who know how to find them."  Drawing lessons from successful food and banking enterprises located in poor, inner-city neighborhoods, the report recommends that policymakers enhance the charter school market by providing more information to consumers, forging community partnerships, allowing for more flexible school financing, and mapping the quality of the education market.

===Parent considerations  ===
The growth in the amount and popularity of charter schools has prompted more parents to consider sending their children to charter schools over public schools.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Altenhofen|first1=Shannon|last2=Berends|first2=Mark|last3=White|first3=Thomas G.|date=2016|title=School Choice Decision Making Among Suburban, High-Income Parents|journal=AERA Open|volume=2|issue=1|page=233285841562409|doi=10.1177/2332858415624098|issn=2332-8584|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gawlik|first=Marytza|date=2016|title=The U.S. Charter School Landscape: Extant Literature, Gaps in Research, and Implications for the U.S. Educational System|journal=Global Education Review|volume=3}}</ref> According to Shannon Altenhofen, this changes the question from "‘public versus charter school?’ to ‘which charter school?’”.<ref name=":0" />{{Non-primary source needed|date=August 2019}} There are several criteria that are commonly considered by parents when choosing schools.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

==== Implications of school choice ====
The concept of [[school choice]] views parents as “consumers” with the responsibility of choosing the best possible school for their child.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Villavicencio|first=Adriana|date=2013-10-20|title="It's Our Best Choice Right Now": Examining the Choice Options of Charter School Parents|journal= Education Policy Analysis Archives|volume=21|page=13|doi=10.14507/epaa.v21n81.2013|issn=1068-2341|doi-access=free}}</ref> There “is little evidence that parents of different races and social classes value fundamentally different qualities in schools,”<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Yettick|first=Holly|date=2016|title=Information Is Bliss: Information Use by School Choice Participants in Denver|journal=Urban Education|language=en|volume=51|issue=8|pages=859–90|doi=10.1177/0042085914550414|s2cid=147282161|issn=0042-0859}}</ref> but there is evidence that “socioeconomic status, social capital, and education level” can limit the parental choice of schools.<ref name=":1" /> The attractive idea of school choice can be affected by parents' social identity.

Most parents, regardless of class status, rely on their social network for choosing schools.<ref name=":0" /> Higher-income parents “have a greater array of social resources and connections to trust when choosing a school, and making the choice seem almost effortless.”<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ewing|first=Eve L.|date=2015|title=Choosing Homes, Choosing Schools Choosing Homes, Choosing Schools edited by Annette Lareau and Kimberly Goyette.

One survey study of 553 upper-income mostly White parents in Colorado's charter schools noted the importance of social networking in their decision to choose charter schools. Of those surveyed “95% of parents reported that they relied on talks with other family members, friends, neighbors, coworkers, and/or parents.”<ref name=":0" /> This study highlighted that upper-income white parents tend to rely greatly on the information given by those in their social networks, but the parents also did their research on “school quality, curriculum, instruction, and other factors to see whether the school is a good fit for their child.<ref name=":0" />

Low income and minority parents, on the other hand, struggle “when it comes to the amount and type of information they can access.”<ref name=":2" /> “The many challenges that low-income families face both shape and limit their views of the costs and benefits of various school choice options.”<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Phillippo|first1=Kate|last2=Griffin|first2=Briellen|date=2014|title=Choosing Homes, Choosing Schools: Residential Segregation and the Search for a Good School. Edited by Annette Lareau and Kimberly A. Goyette.

Parents from the more economically and racially diverse school chose the charter school because of the school's unique qualities which they felt would benefit their child.<ref name=":1" /> Parents from this school also heard about it in their social networks, but that particular charter school did more outreach through advertisements.<ref name=":1" /> In the diverse charter school, White and Asian parents were more likely to transfer out if they were dissatisfied with the charter school as compared to the other ethnic groups.<ref name=":1" />

==== Optimizing selection ====
There is a need for parents to have access to resources that will help them optimize their selection of charter schools. One experimental research study asked 14,989 parents from Denver to rank their top schools, the researchers then focused on the top first school and surveyed the parents by asking them which “resource,” out of all the provided resources, had aided them the most in their decision of ranking their first choice school.<ref name=":2" /> The researchers then analyzed the quality of the top school chosen based on the Denver Public Schools School Performance Framework (SPF) with the noted resource. Parents who chose higher-rated schools were more likely to have listed two particular sources of school information.<ref name=":2" /> One was the “school choice enrollment guide” and the other resource was “parent websites.”<ref name=":2" /> The school choice enrollment guide provided parents with a list of “each school’s SPF rating.”<ref name=":2" /> These valuable resources were able to help low-income minority parents choose schools with higher ratings.<ref name=":2" /> So having access to resources such as school choice enrollment guides and parent websites might help parents optimize their charter school selection.

=== Debate over funding ===

Nearly all charter schools face implementation obstacles, but newly created schools are most vulnerable.  Some charter advocates claim that new charters tend to be plagued by resource limitations, particularly inadequate startup funds. Yet a few charter schools also attract large amounts of interest and money from private sources such as the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]], the Walton Family Foundation, the Broad Foundation, and the NewSchools Venture Fund.{{sfn|Brill|2012|p=254}} Sometimes private businesses and foundations, such as the Ameritech Corporation in Michigan and the Annenberg Fund in California, provide support.<ref name=Jenkins>{{cite journal

Although charter advocates recommend the schools control all per-pupil funds, charter advocates claim that their schools rarely receive as much funding as other public schools.  In reality, this is not necessarily the case in the complex world of school funding. Charter schools in California were guaranteed a set amount of district funding that in some districts amounted to $800 per student per year more than traditional public schools received until a new law was passed that took effect in fall 2006. Charter advocates claim that their schools generally lack access to funding for facilities and special program funds distributed on a district basis.<ref name=Bierlein>{{cite journal

Although charter schools may receive less public funding than traditional public schools, a portion of charter schools' operating costs can come from sources outside public funding (such as private funding in the form of donations). A study funded by the [[American Federation of Teachers]] found that in DC charter schools, private funding accounted for $780 per pupil on average and, combined with a higher level of public funding in some charters (mostly due to non-district funding), resulted in considerably higher funding when compared to comparable public schools.<ref name="AFT_DC">{{cite web

With federal, private, and "other income", charter school funding shot up to an average of $11,644 versus the district $10,384 per pupil.

According to a recent study published in December 2011 by the Center for Education Reform, the national percentage of charter closures were as follows: 42% of charter schools close as a direct result of financial issues, whereas only 19% of charter schools closed due to academic problems.<ref>{{citation

=== Co-location ===

Co-location or collocation of charter schools in public noncharter school buildings has been practiced in both [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]]{{sfn|Brill|2012|pp=133–34}} and is controversial.{{sfn|Brill|2012|pp=133–35, 142}} Since students planning to attend charter schools are generally students who would have attended noncharter schools, co-location permits reassigning seating for the same students from one kind of school to the other in the same building, so that, while space might have to be rebuilt, entire schools do not have to be built from the ground up. The cost savings let more charter schools open.{{sfn|Brill|2012|p=134}} Co-location also permits the two kinds of schools to be visible to each other, thereby promoting school reform, especially within families whose children attend both schools in the same building.{{sfn|Brill|2012|pp=134–35}} It may also mean that a government administration responsible for overseeing noncharter public schools loses political turf as it gives up space to independently run charter schools.{{sfn|Brill|2012|p=134}}

== Criticism ==

=== Difficulties with accountability ===

The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for greater accountability. They are meant to be held accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups, including the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them.  Charter schools can theoretically be closed for failing to meet the terms set forth in their charter, but in practice, this can be difficult, divisive, and controversial. One example was the 2003 revocation of the charter for a school called Urban Pioneer in the [[San Francisco Unified School District]], which first came under scrutiny when two students died on a school wilderness outing.<ref name="Chron2">{{cite news

In March 2009, the Center for Education Reform released its latest data on charter school closures. At that time they found that 657 of the more than 5250 charter schools that have ever opened had closed, for reasons ranging from district consolidation to failure to attract students. The study found that "41 percent of the nation's charter closures resulted from financial deficiencies caused by either low student enrollment or inequitable funding," while 14% had closed due to poor academic performance. The report also found that the absence of achievement data "correlates directly with the weakness of a state's charter school law. For example, states like Iowa, Mississippi, Virginia and Wyoming have laws ranked either "D" or "F". Progress among these schools has not been tracked objectively or clearly."<ref name="Center for Education Reform"/> A 2005 paper found that in Connecticut, which it characterized as having been highly selective in approving charter applications, a relatively large proportion of poorly performing charter schools have closed. <ref name=Miron>{{cite web

Contrary to these assumptions, we have seen from our research and state evaluations that permissive laws and states with large numbers of charter schools are often less likely to have positive outcomes". <ref name=Miron>{{cite web

In a September 2007 public policy report, education experts Andrew Rotherham and Sara Mead of Education Sector offered a series of recommendations to improve charter school quality through increased accountability.  Some of their recommendations urged policymakers to: (i) provide more public oversight of charter school authorizers, including the removal of poor-quality authorizers, (ii) improve the quality of student performance data with more longitudinal student-linked data and multiple measures of school performance, and (iii) clarify state laws related to charter school closure, especially the treatment of displaced students.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Rotherham, Andrew |author2=Mead, Sara |date=September 2007 |title=A Sum Greater Than The Parts: What States Can Teach Each Other About Charter Schooling |publisher=educationsector.org |url=http://www.educationsector.org/research/research_show.htm?doc_id=521913 |access-date=August 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924190116/http://www.educationsector.org/research/research_show.htm?doc_id=521913 |archive-date=September 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
All but 17% of charter school students show no improvement when compared to a heuristically modeled virtual twin traditional public school.<ref name=credo>{{cite web |title=Multiple Choice – Charter School Performance in 16 States |author=CREDO |date=June 2009 |publisher=Stanford University |url=http://credo.stanford.edu/reports/MULTIPLE_CHOICE_CREDO.pdf}}</ref> Educational gains from switching to charter schools from public schools have on average been shown to be "small or insignificant" (Zimmer, et al.) and tend to decline over a span of time (Byrnes). Charter schools provided no substantial improvement in students' educational outcomes that could not be accounted for in a public school setting (Gleason, Clark and Clark Tuttle). Attrition rates for teachers in charter schools have shown annual rates as high as 40%. Students also tend to move from charter schools prior to graduation more often than do students in public schools  (Finch, Lapsley and Baker-Boudissa). Charter schools are often regarded as an outgrowth of the Powell Manifesto advocating corporate domination of the American democratic process and are considered to represent vested interests' attempts to mold public opinion via public school education and to claim a share of this $500–600 billion-dollar industry.<ref name=credo/><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/597486| title = Getting a Feel for the Market: The Use of Privatized School Management in Philadelphia| journal = American Journal of Education| volume = 115| issue = 3| pages = 437–55| year = 2009| last1 = Byrnes | first1 = V. | s2cid = 145759844}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finch |first1=Holmes |first2=Dan |last2=Lapsley |first3= Mary |last3=Baker-Boudissa |title=A survival analysis of student mobility and retention in Indiana |journal=Education Policy Analysis Archives |volume=17 |page=18 |year=2009|doi=10.14507/epaa.v17n18.2009 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Gleason |first=Philip |title=The Evaluation of Charter School Impacts.

=== Scalability ===

Whether the charter school model can be scaled up to the size of a public noncharter school system has been questioned, when teaching demands more from teachers and many noncharter teachers are apparently unable to teach in the way charters seek, as has been suggested by [[Arne Duncan]], [[United States Secretary of Education|U.S. Secretary of Education]], [[Diane Ravitch]], education historian and former assistant U.S. education secretary, [[Mark Roosevelt]], former schools chief for Pittsburgh, Penn., U.S., and Dave Levin, of the [[Knowledge Is Power Program|KIPP charters]]{{sfn|Brill|2012|pp=422–23}} However, some, such as [[Eva Moskowitz]] of [[Success Academy Charter Schools]], believe that the work is hard but performable and compensable and that the model can be scaled up.{{sfn|Brill|2012|p=424}}

=== Shift from progressive to conservative movement ===

Charters were originally a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]] (called the [[Small schools movement|"small schools" movement]]) started by University of Massachusetts professor Ray Budde and [[American Federation of Teachers]] leader [[Al Shanker]] to explore best practices for education without bureaucracy.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} However, some critics argue that the charter movement has shifted into an effort to privatize education and attack teachers' unions.<ref name=ISR /> For example, education historian [[Diane Ravitch]] has estimated, as a "safe guess," that 95% of charters in the United States are non-union and has said that charters follow an unsustainable practice of requiring teachers to work unusually long hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2010/3/8/part_ii_leading_education_scholar_diane_ravitch_on_the_death_and_life_of_the_great_american_school_system|title=Part II: Leading Education Scholar Diane Ravitch on "The Death and Life of the Great American School System"|publisher=}}</ref>

=== Better student test scores / Teacher issues ===

According to a study done by [[Vanderbilt University]], teachers in charter schools are 1.32 times more likely to leave teaching than a district-run public school teacher.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vanderbilt.edu/schoolchoice/documents/stuit_smith_ncspe.pdf|title= Teacher Turnover in Charter Schools|author1=David A. Stuit |author2=Thomas M. Smith |year= 2009|publisher= Vanderbilt University |accessdate= January 30, 2011}}</ref> Another 2004 study done by the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] found that charter schools "are less likely than traditional public schools to employ teachers meeting state certification standards."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/choice/pcsp-final/finalreport.pdf|title= Evaluation of the Public Charter Schools Program: Final Report|author1=Kara Finnigan |author2=Nancy Adelman |author3=Lee Anderson |author4=Lynyonne Cotton |author5=Mary Beth Donnelly |author6=Tiffany Price |year= 2004|publisher= U.S. Department of Education |accessdate= January 30, 2011}}</ref> A national evaluation by [[Stanford University]] found that "students attending charter schools have eight additional days of learning in reading and the same days of learning in math per year compared to their peers in traditional public schools".<ref name=credo13/>

=== Admissions lottery ===

Because demand often exceeds the supply of available seats in charter schools, lotteries are held to determine which students will be admitted. When admission depends on a random lottery, some hopeful applicants may be disappointed. A film about the admission lottery at the [[Success Academy Charter Schools]] (then known as Harlem Success Academy) has been shown as ''[[The Lottery (2010 film)|The Lottery]]''.<ref name="NYDailyNews-20100429-docu">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/04/29/2010-04-29_the_lottery_documentary_shows_education_is_a_sure_bet.html|title='The Lottery' documentary shows education is a sure bet |newspaper=NY Daily News}}</ref><ref name="NYPost-20100428-star">{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/charter_kids_star_R2cC5LBohezWjVJzYrIEYJ|title=Charter kids star|date=April 28, 2010|publisher=}}</ref> It was inspired by a 2008 lottery.<ref name="NYPost-20100428-star" /> The 2010 documentary ''[[Waiting for "Superman"]]'' also examines this issue. A lottery, however, ensures those in wealthier districts do not have a better chance of being accepted.

=== Collective bargaining ===

Concern has also been raised about the exemption of charter school teachers from states' collective bargaining laws, especially because "charter school teachers are even more likely than traditional public school teachers to be beset by the burn-out caused by working long hours, in poor facilities."<ref>{{cite journal

=== Racial segregation ===

One study states that charter schools increase racial segregation.<ref name="contexts" /> A UCLA report points out that most charter schools are located in African-American neighborhoods.<ref>[http://idea.gseis.ucla.edu/newsroom/our-ideas/themes-in-the-news/copy10_of_themes-in-the-news Studies Point to Segregative Effects of Charter Schools], UCLA Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, September 23, 2009.</ref> However, a recent statistical analysis of racial segregation and performance outcomes in U.S. charter schools notes that studies on race and charter schools often incorrectly confound the inter-dependent variables of race and family income (poverty).<ref>Whitehurst, GJR, Reeves, RV and Rodriquez E (2016). "Segregation and Charter Schools: What Do We Know?" Report of Center on Children and Families, Brookings Institution https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ccf_20161021segregation_version-10_211.pdf</ref>  Moreover, the authors conclude: "charter schools with a strong academic focus and "no-excuses" philosophy that serve poor black students in urban areas stand as contradictions to the general association between school-level poverty and academic achievement. These very high-poverty, high-minority schools produce achievement gains that are substantially greater than the traditional public schools in the same catchment areas."<ref>Whitehurst et al., 2016, op cit.</ref> This study concludes that "charter schools are also, on average, more racially segregated than traditional public schools," and state "reducing school segregation and improving the quality of schools serving minority students are both important goals, but they are not the same".<ref>Whitehurst et al., 2016, op cit.</ref>

===Selective admission===
Although charter schools are typically not allowed to engage in selective admissions tests, some charter schools are designated as both charter and [[magnet schools]]. Magnet schools can use admissions tests, evaluation of student records, or even interviews with children's parents to carefully select their student body.<ref name=Reuters021513>{{cite news|author1=Stephanie Simon|title=Special Report: Class Struggle – How charter schools get students they want|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/16/us-usa-charters-admissions-idUSBRE91E0HF20130216#LQueFwGEE4T5eL77.97|accessdate=November 17, 2015|work=Reuters|date=February 15, 2013|quote=Students may be asked to submit a 15-page typed research paper, an original short story, or a handwritten essay on the historical figure they would most like to meet.
