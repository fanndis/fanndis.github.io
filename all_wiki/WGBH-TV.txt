[[File:WGBH, 1 Guest Street, Boston 2011-04-17 (15).jpg|thumb|right|WGBH Guest Street studios (with "digital mural" LED screen)]]
The WGBH Educational Foundation received its first [[broadcast license]] for radio in April 1951 under the auspices of the [[Lowell Institute]] Cooperative Broadcasting Council, a consortium of local universities and cultural institutions, whose collaboration stems from an 1836 bequest by textile manufacturer [[John Lowell, Jr. (philanthropist)|John Lowell, Jr.]] that called for free public lectures for the citizens of Boston. [[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]] first signed on the air on October 6, 1951, with a live broadcast of a performance by the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]].

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) originally awarded a construction permit to [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]]-based electronics company [[Raytheon]] to build a television station that would transmit on [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 2 in Boston. Raytheon planned to launch a commercial television station using the call letters WRTB-TV (for "'''R'''aytheon '''T'''elevision '''B'''roadcasting"). However, after some setbacks and the cancellation of the construction permit license, WRTB never made it on the air, paving the way for the FCC to allocate channel 2 for [[non-commercial educational station|non-commercial educational]] use. WGBH subsequently applied for and received a license to operate on that channel. The WGBH Educational Foundation obtained initial start-up funds for WGBH-TV from the Lincoln and Therese Filene Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jewish Currents - Edward Filene: Pioneer of Social Responsibility|url=http://www.jewishcurrents.org/2004-sept-stillman.htm|author=Yankl Stillman|website=JewishCurrents|date=September 2004|access-date=March 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804183153/http://jewishcurrents.org/2004-sept-stillman.htm|archive-date=August 4, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It is also thought by legend that Raytheon pushed quietly for the FCC to assign WGBH the channel 2 license after it was unable to utilize it.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

WGBH-TV first signed on the air at 5:20&nbsp;p.m. on May 2, 1955, becoming the first [[public television]] station in Boston and the first non-commercial television station to sign on in [[New England]]. The first program to air on the station was ''Come and See'', a [[children's television series|children's program]] hosted by [[Tony Saletan]] and Mary Lou Adams, which was filmed at [[Tufts University|Tufts Nursery Training School]].<ref name="wgbh-timeline">{{cite web|title=WGBH Timeline (1946-1978)|url=http://wgbhalumni.org/2007/01/01/wgbh-timeline-1946-1978/|publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation|date=January 1, 2007|accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref> Channel 2 originally served as a member station of the National Educational Television and Radio Center (NETRC), which evolved into [[National Educational Television]] (NET) in 1963; for its first few years on the air, channel 2 only broadcast on Monday through Fridays between 5:30 and 9:00&nbsp;p.m. It was originally based out of studio facilities located at 84 [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] (since 1965, home to MIT's Stratton Student Center) on the campus of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), which was originally a roller skating rink. The station's callsign refers to [[Great Blue Hill|<u>G</u>reat <u>B</u>lue <u>H</u>ill]] (the highest point in the Boston area at an elevation of {{convert|635|ft|m}}), a location in [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]] that served as the original location of WGBH-TV's transmitter facility and where the transmitter for WGBH radio continues to operate to this day (the callsign is occasionally jokingly referred as "God Bless [[Harvard University|Harvard]]", although the station's connections with the university are at best indirect; Harvard was one of several Boston-area universities which took part in the Lowell Institute Cooperative Broadcasting Council and rented space to WGBH on Western Avenue in Allston for the station's studio operations).

In 1957, Hartford N. Gunn Jr. was appointed [[general manager]] of WGBH; he would later earn the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]'s Ralph Lowell Award for his achievements in programming development.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ralph Lowell Award|url=http://www.cpb.org/aboutpb/awards/lowell/|publisher=[[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}</ref> Under Gunn, who resigned in February 1970 to become president of PBS, WGBH made significant investments in technology and programming to improve the station's profile and set out to make it a producer of public television programming. That February, WGBH expanded its programming to weekends for the first time, adding a four-hour schedule on Sunday afternoons from 2:30 to 6:30&nbsp;p.m. (its sign-on time on Sundays was later extended to 11:00&nbsp;a.m. that May). In March 1958, channel 2 began offering [[distance education#Radio and television|academic instructional television programs]], with the debut of eight weekly science programs aimed at students in the sixth grade, which were televised “in some 48 separate school systems in and around the Boston area.” In November of that year, the station installed a new full-power transmitter donated by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]], which increased channel 2's transmitting power to 100,000 watts.<ref name="wgbh-timeline"/>

[[File:WGBH, 1 Guest Street, Boston 2011-04-17 (10).jpg|left|thumb|Guest Street entrance to the WGBH studios]]
During the early morning hours of October 14, 1961, a large fire caused significant damage to the Cambridge studios of WGBH-TV and WGBH radio. Until the WGBH Educational Foundation was able to build a new studio complex to replace the destroyed former building, the two stations arranged to operate from temporary offices and had to produce their local programming from the studio facilities of various television stations in the Boston area and southern New Hampshire. WGBH-TV maintained a splintered operation, basing its [[master control]] operations at [[Newman Centers|Newman Catholic Center]] at [[Boston University]], production facilities (for which it was reserved to use late nights and on weekends) at the studios of then [[CBS]] affiliate [[WHDH-TV (defunct)|WHDH-TV]] (channel 5, now defunct; allocation as of March, 1972 operated by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WCVB-TV]]) on Morrissey Boulevard in Boston's [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] section, and its film and tape library (including those which were salvaged from the fire) was housed at the studios of fellow NET station [[New Hampshire Public Television|WENH-TV]] (channel 11) in [[Durham, New Hampshire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Fire Ravages WGBH|url=http://tech.mit.edu/archives/VOL_081/TECH_V081_S0190_P001.pdf|newspaper=[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|date=October 18, 1961|accessdate=September 12, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The 1961 WGBH Fire|url=http://wgbhalumni.org/2007/01/01/1961-fire/|website=WGBH-TV|publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation|date=January 1, 2007}}</ref> WGBH was only off the air for one day after the fire.

Several area universities also chipped in to temporarily house other operations displaced by the fire: WGBH's scenic department was relocated to [[Northeastern University]], its arts department was set up on the Boston University campus, and programming and production offices were based in Cambridge's [[Kendall Square]] neighborhood. WHDH, [[NBC]] affiliate [[WBZ-TV]] (channel 4, as of January, 1995 a CBS [[owned-and-operated station]]) and ABC affiliate [[WNAC-TV (defunct)|WNAC-TV]] (channel 7, now defunct; allocation now occupied by [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] that is unrelated to the above-mentioned WHDH which is now WCVB-TV) also provided technical and production assistance to the WGBH television and radio stations until a permanent facility was built to reintegrate the stations' operations.<ref name="wgbh-timeline"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Friends in Need (1962)|url=http://wgbhalumni.org/2007/01/01/friends-in-need-1962/|newspaper=The Boston Globe|via=WGBH-TV|date=April 29, 1962|accessdate=January 1, 2007}}</ref> On August 29, 1963, WGBH-TV and WGBH radio both began operating from a new studio facility for the stations that was built at 125 Western Avenue in Boston's [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]] neighborhood (the post office box address that the station adopted at that time – P.O. Box 350, Boston, MA 02134 – would become associated with a jingle used on the WGBH-produced children's program, ''ZOOM'', both in its [[Zoom (1972 TV series)|1970s]] and [[Zoom (1999 TV series)|late 1990s]] adaptations, exhorting viewers to send in ideas for use on the show<ref>{{cite web|title=Address Song|url=http://pbskids.org/zoom/show/music/address.html|website=[[PBS Kids]]|publisher=[[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]]|date=1998|accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>).

On June 18, 1966, WGBH-TV relocated its transmitter to a broadcast tower in [[Needham, Massachusetts]] (which is now{{when|date=December 2017}} operated by the American Tower Corporation), The following year on September 25, 1967, WGBH-TV gained a sister television station in the Boston area, WGBX-TV (channel 44), which has transmitted its signal from the Needham site since the station signed on (WGBX's digital signal on UHF channel 43 shares the master antenna at the very top of the tower with several commercial stations in the market, while WGBH-TV's channel 19 digital transmitter uses a separate antenna at a lower point). The launch of WGBX was one facet of a plan developed by the WGBH Educational Foundation in the late 1960s to operate a network of six non-commercial television stations around Massachusetts. However, these plans never materialized in their intended form; besides WGBX, the only other station that ultimately made it on the air was [[WGBY]] (channel 57) in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], which launched in 1971. Three additional WGBH-owned stations were to have launched, all of which were slated to use the "WGB" prefix for their call letters; these included WGBW, which was to broadcast on channel 35 in [[Adams, Massachusetts|Adams]] (the "W" in its callsign was to stand for "<u>W</u>est"; the callsign has since been reassigned to a [[WGBW|radio station]] in [[Two Rivers, Wisconsin]]), along with two stations in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]] and [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]].

On the night of April 5, 1968, WGBH-TV (at roughly hours' notice) broadcast a [[James Brown]] concert from the [[Boston Garden]], the night after [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]]. Boston Mayor [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]], who was worried that the concert would set off a riot, and certain that cancellation would be worse, contacted WGBH to air the concert on TV, and told the public to stay home and watch, helping prevent boycotts in the region. The concert would later be seen numerous times in the following days, helping the Boston area stay in peace.

In 1970, WGBH-TV became a member station of the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), which was launched as an independent entity to supersede NET (which itself was integrated into its [[Newark, New Jersey]] outlet, WNDT [now [[WNET]]], per request by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting) and assumed many of the functions of its predecessor network. Over time, WGBH became a pioneer in public television, producing many programs that were seen on NET and later, PBS, that either originated at the station's studio facilities or were otherwise produced by channel 2.

On October 31, 2003, WGBH launched Boston Kids & Family TV, a PBS Kids Channel-affiliated local cable service that was developed in partnership with the City of Boston. Available to [[Xfinity|Comcast]] and [[RCN Corporation|RCN]] subscribers, the service took over channel space previously occupied by one of the city's cable access channels, which carried a mix of [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programs, footage of city-sponsored events, and mayoral press conferences (some of the aforementioned content was moved to the city-managed Educational Channel). Boston Kids & Family carried a mix of children's programs produced by WGBH and other distributors—which were scheduled to avoid simulcasts with WGBH-TV or WGBX-TV—daily from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to 8:00&nbsp;p.m., and a repeating block of telecourse programs aimed at adults from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 7:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref name="bg">{{cite news|title=City revives kids' PBS channel|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2003/10/31/city_revives_kids_pbs_channel/|author=Suzanne C.

As WGBH's operations grew, the 125 Western Avenue building proved inadequate to facilitate it and its sister stations; some administrative operations were moved across the street to 114 Western Avenue, with an overhead pedestrian bridge connecting the two buildings. By 2005, WGBH had facilities in more than a dozen buildings in the Allston area.<ref>{{cite web|title=WGBH Headquarters|url=http://www.vhb.com/template_project.asp?pagename=prj_22111_WGBH&serviceTitle=Watertown|website=Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc.|accessdate=March 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717195459/http://www.vhb.com/template_project.asp?pagename=prj_22111_WGBH&serviceTitle=Watertown|archive-date=July 17, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The station's need for more studio space dovetailed with [[Harvard Business School]]'s desire to expand its adjacent campus; Harvard already owned the land on which the WGBH studios were located, which the university had donated to WGBH for use to construct the Western Avenue facility in 1962 at a value of $250,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Harvard Gives WGBH Land For New Studio|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1962/8/9/harvard-gives-wgbh-land-for-new/|author=[[Bruce L.

WGBH launched a [[digital subchannel]] on virtual channel 2.2 in December 2005, which initially served as an affiliate of the [[World Channel|PBS World]] news and documentary service (the subchannel was branded as "WGBH World").<ref>{{cite news|title=Knight Foundation backs launch planning for PBS's Public Square|url=http://23g9r82i3f1d2a63qz3akhv1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/archive-site/news/news0523publicsquare.shtml|periodical=[[Current (magazine)|Current]]|publisher=Current LLC|date=December 19, 2005|accessdate=March 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426134453/http://23g9r82i3f1d2a63qz3akhv1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/archive-site/news/news0523publicsquare.shtml|archive-date=April 26, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2007, World programming was moved to the 44.2 subchannel of WGBX; WGBH replaced the network with a [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] simulcast of its analog feed. The station discontinued the SD simulcast of channel 2.1 on April 17, 2012, when WGBH-DT2 re-assumed the local affiliation rights to World, which was simulcast on WGBX-DT2 for several months after the switch, before the former subchannel became its exclusive Boston outlet.

===WGBH-DT3===
WGBH launched a tertiary subchannel on virtual channel 2.3 in 2005, which offered [[high-definition television|high definition]] program content separate from that seen on the station's analog signal via the PBS-HD satellite feed; in 2008, the subchannel switched to a high-definition simulcast of the analog signal, with standard-definition programming presented in a [[windowbox (film)|windowboxed]] or [[letterbox]]ed format. WGBH decommissioned the DT3 feed in 2010.

===Spectrum auction repacking===
In a list announcing the winning bids for stations which participated in the [[2016 United States wireless spectrum auction]] released by the FCC on April 13, 2017, WGBH-TV was disclosed to have agreed to sell a portion of the broadcast spectrum allocated to its UHF channel 19 digital signal for a bid of $161,723,929;<ref>{{cite web|title=FCC Broadcast Television Spectrum Incentive Auction: Auction 1001: Winning Bids|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-17-314A2.pdf|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|date=April 13, 2017}}</ref> in a statement, the station said it would "use the proceeds to expand its educational services to children and students, further its in-depth journalism, and strengthen its modest endowment."<ref name="tbg-wgbhproceeds">{{cite news|title=WGBH, WLVI reap huge windfall in sale of broadcast spectrum|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/04/13/wgbh-wlvi-reap-huge-windfall-sale-broadcast-spectrum/Dup2N9TEWT63kQbAJjVxwI/story.html|author=Dan Adams|author2=Shirley Leung|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=Boston Globe Media Group|date=April 13, 2017|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}</ref> The station also consigned to move its digital allocation to a low-band VHF channel; the FCC assigned VHF channel 5 (the former analog channel allocation of WCVB-TV) as the post-repack digital allocation to which WGBH was reassigned once the repacking of auction and repack participant stations were occurred on August 2, 2019. WGBH-TV's post repack facility on VHF 5 is located at the nearby American Tower owned facility on Cabot Street, also in Needham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fccinfo.com/CMDProEngine.php?sCurrentService=TV&tabSearchType=Appl&sAppIDNumber=25076f915c78b6bf015cb8dd92ea248a|title=FCCInfo Results|website=www.fccinfo.com|accessdate=March 25, 2019}}</ref>

Because the VHF channel 5 signal is significantly weaker than the prior UHF channel 19 signal, the repack left many over-the-air viewers in the Greater Boston area unable to receive the station's primary broadcasts on WGBH 2.1 and WGBX 44.1. A notice posted on the station's website in early 2020 states that a power upgrade is forthcoming which will boost the signal from 6.9 kW to 34.5 kW, but that the upgrade "is temporarily on hold, pending the mitigation of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Boston|COVID-19 pandemic]]". The notice remains on the site as of September 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Digital TV Over-the-Air Reception Problems |url=https://help.wgbh.org/s/article/Digital-TV-Over-the-Air-Reception-Problems |website=GBH |accessdate=7 September 2020}}</ref>

WGBH-TV operates a secondary station in the Boston [[media market|market]], WGBX-TV (channel 44), which signed on the air on September 25, 1967. The station's schedule focuses on program genres not covered by WGBH-TV. Reruns of programs aired the previous evening on WGBX and WGBH-TV also make up a portion of the station's programming schedule. WGBX also maintains several digital subchannels that rebroadcast programs produced by WGBH and other PBS member stations around the U.S.

===Media Access Group===
WGBH is a leading provider of accessible media services for the deaf, hard-of-hearing, blind and visually impaired for use by commercial and public television producers, and to home video, websites, and movie theaters throughout the United States through the Media Access Group, a non-profit organization that was founded by the WGBH Educational Foundation in 1990. The unit originated with the founding of The Caption Center in 1972, which invented the method of [[closed captioning]] to improve access to television programs for the hearing impaired (''The French Chef'' was the first program to offer captioning provided by the unit), and created the [[Rear Window Captioning System]] for [[feature film|films]]. Along with providing closed captions for television programs seen on channel 2 and its sister stations, the Media Access Group is a major captioning provider for programs on other broadcast television networks (with the exception of ABC) and several [[cable channel]]s. It also developed the [[Descriptive Video Service]], and is the main provider for [[audio description]] soundtracks that give visually impaired viewers details about events occurring on-screen within an individual program, which are commonly found on PBS, and select broadcast networks and cable channels.

==Programming==
As a PBS member station, much of WGBH-TV's program schedule consists of educational and entertainment programming distributed by PBS to its member stations, including non-WGBH productions such as the ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'', the ''[[Nightly Business Report]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[Peg + Cat]]'' and ''[[Nature (TV program)|Nature]]''; it also carries programs distributed by [[American Public Television]] and other sources to fill its schedule, alongside programs produced for exclusive local broadcast in the Boston market.

WGBH features a mix of live-action and animated children's programs produced by the station and other distributors between 6:00&nbsp;a.m. and 5:00&nbsp;p.m., as well as on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The remainder of its weekday lineup includes a two-hour block of news and travel programs leading into prime time, with documentary, arts and entertainment programs provided by PBS shown Sunday through Fridays during prime time (encores of WGBH national productions typically air on Saturday evenings). Programming on Saturday afternoons focuses heavily on cooking and home improvement how-to shows (at one point, the station's Saturday afternoon lineup was branded as "How 2 Saturday"), while Sunday afternoons focus mainly on travel shows along with some how-to programs.

===Original productions===
For the better part of its history, WGBH-TV has been a major producer of programming for PBS and its predecessor, NET. Channel 2 produces more than two-thirds of the programs that PBS distributes nationally to its member stations. Among them are longstanding PBS mainstays such as ''[[Nova (American TV program)|NOVA]]'', ''[[Frontline (American TV program)|Frontline]]'', ''[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece]]'', ''[[American Experience]]'', ''[[The Victory Garden (TV program)|The Victory Garden]]'', and ''[[This Old House]]''.

Other notable programs originated by WGBH have included ''[[The French Chef]]'' (a pioneering cooking show featuring [[Julia Child]]), and ''[[The Scarlet Letter (miniseries)|The Scarlet Letter]]'' (a major [[costume drama]] miniseries produced on-location that was the first challenger to the British dominance in such programming in America, and was PBS's highest-rated series for many years). The station has co-produced many other period dramas in conjunction with British production companies. Broadcasts of concerts by the Boston Symphony established the genre as a staple on television.

WGBH has also engaged in several experiments in programming and technology that have become standard in television, including:
* [[Nam June Paik]]'s wild morphing of the television image, and antic adventures in narrative story-telling (''What's Happening, Mr. Silver?'', ''Nine Heroes'')
* [[Ron Hayes]]' use of slit-scan imagery inspired by the yearning, driving themes of Wagner's ''[[Liebestod]]''
* The two-screen color stereo dance program ''CITY/motion/space/game''.
* Arts series produced in collaboration with Boston's [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] (''Museum Open House, Images, Eye-to-Eye'') set the bar for the medium and were a major contributing force in "[[video art]]".
* The Workshop for New Television developed works in dance (Dan Wagoner's ''George's House'') and in drama (Mary Feldhaus-Weber's ''RED, BLUE, GOLD'').
