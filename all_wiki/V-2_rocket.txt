The '''V-2''' ({{lang-de|[[V-weapons|Vergeltungswaffe]] 2}}, "Retribution Weapon 2"), with the technical name '''''[[Aggregat (rocket family)|Aggregat]] 4''''' ('''A4'''), was the world's first long-range<ref>"Long-range" in the context of the time.

The missile, powered by a [[liquid-propellant rocket]] engine, was developed during the [[Second World War]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] as a "[[V-weapons|vengeance weapon]]", assigned to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the [[Strategic bombing during World War II#The British later in the war|Allied bombings]] against German cities. The {{nowrap|V-2}} rocket also became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the [[Kármán line]] with the vertical launch of [[MW 18014]] on 20 June 1944.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemünde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780029228951 |url-access=registration |last=Neufeld |first=Michael J. |publisher=The Free Press |year=1995 |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780029228951/page/158 158], 160–162, 190 |access-date=15 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028112702/https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780029228951 |archive-date=28 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Research into military use of long-range rockets began when the studies of [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] student [[Wernher von Braun]] attracted the attention of the German Army. A series of prototypes culminated in the A-4, which went to war as the {{nowrap|V-2}}. Beginning in September 1944, over 3,000 {{nowrap|V-2s}} were launched by the German [[Wehrmacht]] against Allied targets, first [[London]] and later [[Antwerp]] and [[Liège]]. According to a 2011 [[BBC]] documentary,{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=89}} the attacks from {{nowrap|V-2s}} resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel, and a further 12,000 forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons.<ref name="Thimm">"Am Anfang war die V2.

The rockets travelled at supersonic speed, arrived without warning, and there was no effective defence against them. Many more would have died, but Germany was collapsing, and teams from the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]]—the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Soviet Union]]—raced to capture key German manufacturing sites and technology, and the launching sites were overrun. Von Braun and over 100 key {{nowrap|V-2}} personnel surrendered to the Americans and many of the original {{nowrap|V-2}} team ended up [[Operation Paperclip|working]] at the [[Redstone Arsenal]]. The US also captured enough {{nowrap|V-2}} hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles. The Soviets gained possession of the {{nowrap|V-2}} manufacturing facilities after the war, re-established {{nowrap|V-2}} production, and moved it to the Soviet Union.

== Developmental history ==
{{further|Wernher von Braun#Early life and education|Wernher von Braun#Career in Germany}}
In the late 1920s, a young [[Wernher von Braun]] bought a copy of [[Hermann Oberth]]'s book, ''[[Wege zur Raumschiffahrt|Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen]]'' (''The Rocket into Interplanetary Spaces''). Starting in 1930, he attended the [[Technical University of Berlin]], where he assisted Oberth in liquid-fueled rocket motor tests. Von Braun was working on his doctorate when the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] gained power in Germany. An artillery captain, [[Walter Dornberger]], arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for von Braun, who from then on worked next to Dornberger's existing solid-fuel rocket test site at [[Kummersdorf]]. Von Braun's thesis, ''Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket'' (dated 16 April 1934), was kept classified by the German Army and was not published until 1960.<ref>''Konstruktive, theoretische und experimentelle Beiträge zu dem Problem der Flüssigkeitsrakete. Raketentechnik und Raumfahrtforschung, Sonderheft 1'' (1960), Stuttgart, Germany</ref> By the end of 1934, his group had successfully launched two rockets that reached heights of {{cvt|2.2|and|3.5|km|mi}}.

At the time, Germany was highly interested in American physicist [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s research. Before 1939, German engineers and scientists occasionally contacted Goddard directly with technical questions. Von Braun used Goddard's plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the ''[[Aggregate series|Aggregat]]'' (A) series of [[rocket]]s, named for the German word for mechanism or mechanical system.<ref>Christopher, John (2013). ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes''. The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, p.110.</ref>

Following successes at [[Kummersdorf]] with the first two [[Aggregate series]] rockets, Wernher von Braun and [[Walter Riedel]] began thinking of a much larger rocket in the summer of 1936,<ref name=Ordway>{{cite book |last1=Ordway |first1= Frederick I, III | author1-link = Frederick I.

In addition, Dornberger specified the military requirements needed to include a 1 ton payload, a range of 172 miles with a dispersion of 2 or 3 miles, and transportable using road vehicles.<ref name=walter />{{rp|50–51}}

By late 1941, the [[Peenemünde Army Research Center|Army Research Center]] at Peenemünde possessed the technologies essential to the success of the A-4.

In 1943 the Austrian resistance group around [[Heinrich Maier]] managed to send the exact drawings of the V2 rocket to the American Office of Strategic Services. Location sketches of V-rocket manufacturing facilities, such as those in Peenemünde, were also sent to Allied general staffs in order to enable Allied bombers to carry out air strikes.

[[File:Aggregat4-Schnitt-engl.jpg|left|upright=1.35|thumb|Layout of a V-2 rocket]]
The A-4 used a 75% [[ethanol]]/25% water mixture ([[List of stoffs|''B-Stoff'']]) for fuel and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) ([[List of stoffs|''A-Stoff'']]) for [[oxidizer]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Dungan|first=T|title=The A4-V2 Rocket Site|url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/makeup/design.html|accessdate=2 June 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531211234/http://www.v2rocket.com/start/makeup/design.html|archivedate=31 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  The water reduced the flame temperature, acted as a coolant by turning to steam and augmented the thrust, tended to produce a smoother burn, and reduced thermal stress.<ref name="sutton">{{cite book |last1=Sutton |first1=George |title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines |date=2006 |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |location=Reston |isbn=9781563476495 |pages=740–753}}</ref>

Rudolf Hermann's [[supersonic wind tunnel]] was used to measure the A-4's aerodynamic characteristics and center of pressure, using a model of the A-4 within a 40 square centimeter chamber.  Measurements were made using a [[Mach number]] 1.86 blowdown nozzle on 8 August 1940.  Tests at Mach numbers 1.56 and 2.5 were made after 24 September 1940.<ref name=hunley/>{{rp|76-78}}

At launch the A-4 propelled itself for up to 65 seconds on its own power, and a program motor controlled the pitch to the specified angle at engine shutdown, after which the rocket continued on a [[wikt:ballistic|ballistic]] free-fall trajectory. The rocket reached a height of {{cvt|80|km}} after shutting off the engine.<ref>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] V2 Factory: Nordhausen 070723</ref>

The fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven by a steam turbine, and the steam was produced by concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]] ([[T-Stoff]]) with [[sodium permanganate]] ([[Z-Stoff]]) [[catalyst]]. Both the alcohol and oxygen tanks were an aluminium-magnesium alloy.<ref name=Kennedy>{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Gregory P. |title=Vengeance Weapon 2: The V-2 Guided Missile |year=1983 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington, DC |pages=27, 74}}</ref>

The [[turbopump]], rotating at 4000 [[rpm]], forced the alcohol and oxygen into the combustion chamber at 33 gallons per second, where they were ignited by a spinning electrical igniter. Thrust increased to 8 tons during this preliminary stage, before increasing to 25 tons, lifting the 13.5 ton rocket. Combustion gases exited the chamber at {{convert|5100|°F|°C}}, and a speed of 6500 feet per second. The oxygen to fuel mixture was 1.0:0.85 at 25 tons of thrust, but as [[ambient pressure]] decreased with flight altitude, thrust increased until it reached 29 tons.<ref name=walter>{{cite book |last1=Dornberger |first1=Walter |title=V-2 |date=1954 |publisher=The Viking Press, Inc. |location=New York |pages=17–18,120,122–123,132}}</ref><ref name="steven">{{cite book |last1=Zaloga |first1=Steven |title=V-2 Ballistic Missile, 1942–52 |date=2003 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-84176-541-9 |page=19}}</ref><ref name=redstone />  The turbopump assembly contained two centrifugal pumps, one for the alcohol, and one for the oxygen, both connected to a common shaft.  [[Hydrogen peroxide]] converted to steam, using a [[sodium permanganate]] catalyst powered the pump, which delivered 120 pounds of alcohol and 150 pounds of liquid oxygen per second to a combustion chamber at 210 [[pounds per square inch|psi]].<ref name=hunley/> 

Dr. Thiel's development of the 25 ton rocket motor relied on pump feeding, rather than on the earlier pressure feeding. The motor used centrifugal injection, while using both [[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] and film cooling.  Film cooling admitted alcohol into the combustion chamber and exhaust nozzle under slight pressure through four rings of small perforations. The mushroom-shaped injection head was removed from the combustion chamber to a mixing chamber, the combustion chamber was made more spherical while being shortened from 6 to 1 foot in length, and the connection to the nozzle was made cone shaped. The resultant 1.5 ton chamber operated at a combustion pressure of 220 [[pounds per square inch]]. Thiel's 1.5 ton chamber was then scaled up to a 4.5 ton motor by arranging three injection heads above the combustion chamber. By 1939, eighteen injection heads in two concentric circles at the head of the 0.12-inch thick sheet-steel chamber, were used to make the 25 ton motor.<ref name=walter />{{rp|52–55}}<ref name="hunley">{{cite book |last1=Hunley |first1=J.D. |title=Preludes to U.S. Space-Launch Vehicle Technology: Goddard Rockets to Minuteman III |date=2008 |publisher=University Press of Florida |location=Gainesville |isbn=9780813031774 |pages=67–76}}</ref>

The warhead was another source of troubles. The explosive employed was [[amatol|amatol 60/40]] detonated by an electric [[contact fuze]]. Amatol had the advantage of stability, and the warhead was protected by a thick layer of [[glass wool]], but even so it could still explode in the re-entry phase. The warhead weighed {{convert|975|kg|lb}} and contained {{convert|910|kg|lb}} of explosive. The warhead's percentage by weight that was explosive was 93%, a very high percentage when compared with other types of munition.

The protective layer was used for the fuel tanks as well and the A-4 did not have the tendency to form ice, which had plagued other early missiles (like the [[balloon tank]]-design [[SM-65 Atlas]]). The tanks held {{convert|4173|kg|lb}} of ethyl alcohol and {{convert|5553|kg|lb}} of oxygen.<ref>War machine encyclopedia, Limited publishing, London 1983 p 1690–92</ref>

[[File:Antwerp V-2.jpg|thumb|Captured V-2 on public display in Antwerp, 1945. Exhaust vanes and external rudders in tail section shown.]]
The V-2 was guided by four external rudders on the tail fins, and four internal [[graphite]] vanes in the jet stream at the exit of the motor. These 8 control surfaces were controlled by [[Helmut Hölzer]]'s [[analog computer]], the ''Mischgerät'', via electrical-hydraulic [[servomotor]]s, based on electrical signals from the gyros.  The Siemens ''Vertikant'' LEV-3 guidance system consisted of two free [[gyroscope]]s (a horizontal for pitch and a vertical with two degrees of freedom for yaw and roll) for lateral stabilization, coupled with a [[PIGA accelerometer]], or the Walter Wolman radio control system, to control engine cutoff at a specified velocity. Other gyroscopic systems used in the A-4 included Kreiselgeräte's SG-66 and SG-70. The V-2 was launched from a pre-surveyed location, so the distance and [[azimuth]] to the target were known. Fin 1 of the missile was aligned to the target azimuth.<ref>Stakem, Patrick H. ''The History of Spacecraft Computers from the V-2 to the Space Station'', 2010, PRB Publishing, ASIN B004L626U6</ref><ref name=hunley/>{{rp|rp|81-82}}

Some later V-2s used "[[Beam riding|guide beams]]", radio signals transmitted from the ground, to keep the missile on course, but the first models used a simple [[analog computer]]<ref>[http://www.cdvandt.org/Hoelzer%20V4.pdf Helmut Hoelzer’s Fully Electronic Analog Computer used in the German V2 (A4) rockets.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428214820/http://cdvandt.org/Hoelzer%20V4.pdf |date=28 April 2016 }} (PDF, English, German)</ref> that adjusted the azimuth for the rocket, and the flying distance was controlled by the timing of the engine cut-off, ''"[[Brennschluss]]"'', ground controlled by a [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] system or by different types of on-board integrating [[accelerometer]]s.

The painting of the operational V-2s was mostly a [[Splittertarnmuster|ragged-edged pattern]] with several variations, but at the end of the war a plain olive green rocket also appeared. During tests the rocket was painted in a characteristic black-and-white [[chessboard]] pattern, which aided in determining if the rocket was spinning around its longitudinal axis.

On 27 March 1942, Dornberger proposed production plans and the building of a launching site on the Channel coast. In December, Speer ordered Major Thom and Dr. Steinhoff to reconnoiter the site near Watten. Assembly rooms were established at Pennemünde and in the [[Friedrichshafen]] facilities of Zeppelin Works. In 1943, a third factory, [[Raxwerke]], was added.<ref name=walter />{{rp|71–72,84}}

On 22 December 1942, Hitler signed the order for mass production, when [[Albert Speer]] assumed final technical data would be ready by July 1943. However, many issues still remained to be solved even by the autumn of 1943.<ref name="Speer">{{cite book |last1=Speer |first1=Albert |title=Inside the Third Reich |date=1995 |publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84212-735-3 |pages=496–497}}</ref>

On 8 January 1943, Dornberger and von Braun met with Speer. Speer stated, "As head of the [[Todt organisation]] I will take it on myself to start at once with the building of the launching site on the Channel coast," and established an A-4 production committee under Degenkolb.<ref name=walter />{{rp|72–77}}

On 26 May 1943, the Long-Range Bombardment Commission, chaired by [[AEG]] director Petersen, met at Pennemünde to review the [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and V-2 automatic long-range weapons. In attendance were Speer, Air Marshal [[Erhard Milch]], Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]], Col. General [[Friedrich Fromm]], and [[Karl Saur]]. Both weapons had reached the stage of development, and the commission decided to recommend to Hitler that both weapons be put into mass production. As Dornberger observed, "The disadvantages of the one would be compensated by the other's advantages."<ref name=walter />{{rp|83–84,87–92}}

On 7 July 1943, Major General Dornberger, von Braun, and Dr. Steinhof briefed Hitler in his [[Wolf's Lair]]. Also in attendance were Speer, [[Wilhelm Keitel]], and [[Alfred Jodl]]. The briefing included von Braun narrating a film showing the successful launch on 3 October 1942, with scale models of the Channel coast firing bunker, and supporting vehicles, including the Meillerwagen. Hitler then gave Pennemünde top priority in the German armaments program stating, "Why was it I could not believe in the success of your work? if we had had these rockets in 1939 we should never have had this war..." Hitler also wanted a second launch bunker built.<ref name=walter />{{rp|93–105}}

Saur planned to build 2000 rockets per month, between the existing three factories and the Nordhausen Mittelwerk factory being built. However, alcohol production was dependent upon the potato harvest.<ref name=walter />{{rp|97,102–105}}

A production line was nearly ready at Peenemünde when the [[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]] attack occurred. The main targets of the attack included the test stands, the development works, the Pre-Production Works, the settlement where the scientists and technicians lived, the Trassenheide camp, and the harbor sector. According to Dornberger, "Serious damage to the works, contrary to first impressions, was surprisingly small." Work resumed after a delay of four to six weeks, and because of camouflage to mimic complete destruction, there were no more raids over the next nine months. The raid resulted in 735 lives lost, with heavy losses at Trassenheide, while 178 were killed in the settlement, including Dr. Thiel, his family, and Chief Engineer Walther.<ref name=walter />{{rp|139–152}} The Germans eventually moved production to the underground ''[[Mittelwerk]]'' in the [[Kohnstein]] where 5,200 V-2 rockets were built with the use of [[forced labour]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ruggles |first1=Richard |last2=Brodie |first2=Henry |year=1947 |title=An Empirical Approach to Economic Intelligence in World War II |journal=[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]] |volume=42 |issue=237 |pages=72–91 |doi=10.2307/2280189 |jstor=2280189}}</ref>

After Hitler's 29 August 1944 declaration to begin V-2 attacks as soon as possible, the offensive began on 7 September 1944 when two were launched at Paris, but both crashed soon after launch. On 8 September a single rocket was launched at Paris, which caused modest damage near [[Porte d'Italie]].<ref name=Ordway />{{Rp|218,220,467}} Two more launches by the 485th followed, including one from [[The Hague]] against London on the same day at 6:43&nbsp;pm.<ref name=Irving />{{Rp|285}} – the first landed at [[Staveley Road]], [[Chiswick]], killing 63-year-old Mrs. Ada Harrison, 3-year-old Rosemary Clarke, and [[Sapper]] Bernard Browning on leave from the Royal Engineers,<ref name=Middlebrook />{{Rp|11}} and one that hit Epping with no casualties.

Positions of the German launch units changed a number of times. For example, ''Artillerie Init 444'' arrived in the southwest Netherlands (in [[Zeeland]]) in September 1944. From a field near the village of [[Serooskerke, Walcheren|Serooskerke]], five V-2s were launched on 15 and 16 September, with one more successful and one failed launch on the 18th. That same date, a transport carrying a missile took a wrong turn and ended up in Serooskerke itself, giving a villager the opportunity to surreptitiously take some photographs of the weapon; these were smuggled to London by the [[Dutch Resistance]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Walcheren onder vuur en water 1939–1945 |last2=Eekman |first2=P.G. |last3=Roelse |first3=J. |last4=Tuynman |first4=J. |publisher=Den Boer Middelburg/Uitgevers |year=1984 |isbn=90-70027-82-8 |location=Middelburg |page=98 |language=nl |last1=van Dijk |first1=A.H.}}</ref> After that the unit moved to the woods near [[Rijs]], [[Gaasterland]] in the northwest Netherlands, to ensure that the technology did not fall into Allied hands. From Gaasterland V-2s were launched against [[Ipswich]] and [[Norwich]] from 25 September (London being out of range). Because of their inaccuracy, these V-2s did not hit their target cities. Shortly after that only London and Antwerp remained as designated targets as ordered by [[Adolf Hitler]] himself, Antwerp being targeted in the period of 12 to 20 October, after which time the unit moved to The Hague.

=== Possible use during Operation Bodenplatte ===

At least one V-2 missile on a mobile ''[[Meillerwagen]]'' launch trailer was observed being elevated to launch position by a [[USAAF]] [[4th Fighter Group]] pilot defending against the massive New Year's Day 1945 [[Operation Bodenplatte]] strike by the Luftwaffe over the northern German attack route near the town of [[Lochem]] on 1 January 1945. Possibly, from the potential sighting of the American fighter by the missile's launch crew, the rocket was quickly lowered from a near launch-ready 85° elevation to 30°.<ref>Ordway & Sharpe 1979, p. 256.</ref>

=== Tactical use on German target===

After the US Army captured the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] during the [[Battle of Remagen]] on 7 March 1945, the Germans were desperate to destroy it. On 17 March 1945, they fired eleven V-2 missiles at the bridge, their first use against a tactical target and the only time they were fired on a German target during the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bruecke-remagen.de/ausstellung/3-1_en.htm |title="The Watch on the Rhine" Everyday Life of the Soldiers at the Bridge |accessdate=25 November 2014 |publisher=Friedensmuseum Brücke von Remagen |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194759/http://www.bruecke-remagen.de/ausstellung/3-1_en.htm |archivedate=23 September 2015  }}</ref> They could not employ the more accurate ''Leitstrahl'' device because it was oriented towards Antwerp and could not be easily adjusted for another target.

=== Big Ben and Crossbow ===
Unlike the [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]], the V-2's speed and trajectory made it practically invulnerable to anti-aircraft guns and fighters, as it dropped from an altitude of {{cvt|100|-|110|km}} at up to three times the speed of sound at sea level (approximately 3550&nbsp;km/h). Nevertheless, the threat of what was then code-named "Big Ben" was great enough that efforts were made to seek countermeasures. The situation was similar to the pre-war concerns about manned bombers and led to a similar solution, the formation of the Crossbow Committee, to collect, examine and develop countermeasures.

Early on, it was believed that the V-2 employed some form of radio guidance, a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver. This led to efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as September 1944, using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the UK. In October, a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were having no obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.<ref name="stock25">Jeremy Stocker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-RAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20 "Britain and Ballistic Missile Defence, 1942–2002"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920143537/https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-RAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20 |date=20 September 2017 }}, pp. 20–28.</ref>

=== Anti-aircraft gun system ===
General [[Frederick Alfred Pile]], commander of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]], studied the problem and proposed that enough [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket's path, but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory. The first estimates suggested that 320,000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket. About 2% of these were expected to fall back to the ground, almost 90 tons of rounds, which would cause far more damage than the missile. At a 25 August 1944 meeting of the Crossbow Committee, the concept was rejected.<ref name=stock25 />

Pile continued studying the problem, and returned with a proposal to fire only 150 shells at a single rocket, with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to Earth unexploded. Some low-level analysis suggested that this would be successful against 1 in 50 rockets, provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time. Work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] that were provided with pre-configured firing data for {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1|adj=mid|abbr=off}} grids of the London area. After the trajectory was determined, the guns would aim and fire between 60 and 500 rounds.<ref name=stock25 />

At a Crossbow meeting on 15 January 1945 Pile's updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from [[Roderic Hill]] and [[Charles Drummond Ellis]]. However, the Committee suggested that a test not be carried out as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed. By March this had changed significantly, with 81% of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into, or the one beside it. At a 26 March meeting the plan moved ahead, and Pile was directed to a subcommittee with [[RV Jones]] and Ellis to further develop the statistics. Three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2,000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down. Plans for an operational test began, but as Pile later put it, "[[Bernard Montgomery|Monty]] beat us to it", as the attacks ended with the Allied liberation of their launching areas.<ref name=stock25 />

With the Germans no longer in control of any part of the continent that could be used as a launching site capable of striking London, they turned their attention to Antwerp. Plans were made to move the Pile system to protect that city, but the war ended before anything could be done.<ref name=stock25 />

=== Direct attack ===
The only effective defence against the V-2 campaign was to destroy the launch infrastructure—expensive in terms of bomber resources and casualties—or to cause the Germans to aim at the wrong place through [[disinformation]]. The British were able to convince the Germans to direct [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1s]] and V-2s aimed at London to less populated areas east of the city. This was done by sending deceptive reports on the damage caused and sites hit via the German espionage network in Britain, which was controlled by the British (the [[Double-Cross System]]).{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=100}}

According to the BBC television presenter [[Raymond Baxter]], who served with the RAF during the war, in February 1945 his squadron was carrying out a mission against a V2 launch site, when one missile was launched in front of them. One member of Baxter's squadron opened fire on it, without effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/denhaag.html|title=V2ROCKET.COM – Den Haag, Wassenaar, Hoek van Holland|website=www.v2rocket.com|access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223065336/http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/denhaag.html|archive-date=23 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 3 March 1945 the Allies attempted to destroy V-2s and launching equipment in the "Haagse Bos" in The Hague by a [[Bombing of the Bezuidenhout|large-scale bombardment]], but due to navigational errors the [[Bezuidenhout]] quarter was destroyed, killing 511 Dutch civilians. Churchill sent a scathing minute to General Ismay requesting a thorough explanation for "this extraordinarily bad aiming".<ref>Churchill to Ismay: 18 March 1945</ref>

== Assessment ==
The German V-weapons (V-1 and V-2) cost the equivalent of around US$40 billion (2015 dollars), which was 50 percent more than the [[Manhattan Project]] that produced the atomic bomb.<ref name=Ordway />{{Rp|178}}
6,048 V-2s were built, at a cost of approximately 100,000 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] (GB£2,370,000 (2011)) each; 3,225 were launched.
SS General [[Hans Kammler]], who as an [[engineer]] had constructed several [[concentration camp]]s including [[Auschwitz]], had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as [[slavery|slave]] laborers in the rocket program. More people died manufacturing the V-2 than were killed by its deployment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/mittel.html|title=V2ROCKET.COM – Mittelwerk / DORA|work=v2rocket.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719045156/http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/mittel.html|archivedate=19 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

<div class="infobox" style="width:20em;">
"... those of us who were seriously engaged in the war were very grateful to Wernher von Braun. We knew that each V-2 cost as much to produce as a high-performance fighter airplane. We knew that German forces on the fighting fronts were in desperate need of airplanes, and that the V-2 rockets were doing us no military damage. From our point of view, the V-2 program was almost as good as if Hitler had adopted a policy of unilateral disarmament."

The psychological effect of the V-2 was considerable, as the V-2, travelling faster than the [[speed of sound]], gave no warning before impact (unlike bombing planes or the [[V-1 Flying Bomb]], which made a characteristic buzzing sound). There was no effective defence and no risk of pilot and crew casualties.  An example of the impression it made is in the reaction of American pilot and future nuclear strategist and Congressional aide [[William Liscum Borden]], who in November 1944 while returning from a nighttime mission over Holland saw a V-2 in flight on its way to strike London:<ref>{{cite book | author-last = Hewlett | author-first = Richard G.  | author2-last = Duncan | author2-first = Francis | title = Atomic Shield, 1947–1952 | volume=2 | series = A History of the United States Atomic Energy Commission | publisher = Pennsylvania State University Press | location = University Park, Pennsylvania | date = 1969 | page=180 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author-last = Rhodes | author-first = Richard | title = Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb | publisher = Simon & Schuster | location = New York | date=1995 | page=357 }}</ref>  "It resembled a meteor, streaming red sparks and whizzing past us as though the aircraft were motionless.

With the war all but lost, regardless of the factory output of conventional weapons, the Nazis resorted to V-weapons as a tenuous last hope to influence the war militarily (hence Antwerp as V-2 target), as an extension of their desire to "punish" their foes and most importantly to give hope to their supporters with their [[Wunderwaffe|miracle weapon]].<ref name=Irons /> The V-2 had no effect on the outcome of the war, but it led to the [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] of the [[Cold War]], which in turn were used for space exploration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eucom.mil/article/23076/this-week-in-eucom-history-february-6-12-1959 |title=This Week in EUCOM History: February 6–12, 1959 |date=6 February 2012 |publisher=[[EUCOM]] |accessdate=8 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921003453/http://www.eucom.mil/article/23076/this-week-in-eucom-history-february-6-12-1959 |archivedate=21 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

== Unfulfilled plans ==
A submarine-towed launch platform was tested successfully, making it the prototype for [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s. The project codename was ''Prüfstand XII'' ("Test stand XII"), sometimes called the [[rocket U-boat]]. If deployed, it would have allowed a [[U-boat]] to launch V-2 missiles against United States cities, though only with considerable effort (and limited effect).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboataces.com/articles-rocket-uboat.shtml |title=Hitler's Rocket U-boat Program – history of WW2 rocket submarine |publisher=Uboataces.com |accessdate=27 April 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403090456/http://www.uboataces.com/articles-rocket-uboat.shtml |archivedate=3 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
Hitler, in July 1944 and Speer, in January 1945, made speeches alluding to the scheme,<ref>Article in San Diego Times c.25 July 1944</ref> though Germany did not possess the capability to fulfill these threats. These schemes were met by the Americans with [[Operation Teardrop]].{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

While interned after the war by the British at [[CSDIC]] camp 11, Dornberger was recorded saying that he had begged the Führer to stop the V-weapon propaganda, because nothing more could be expected from one ton of explosive. To this Hitler had replied that ''Dornberger'' might not expect more, but ''he'' (Hitler) certainly did.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

At the end of the war, a race began between the United States and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] to retrieve as many V-2 rockets and staff as possible.<ref>"We Want with the West", ''Time Magazine'', 9 December 1946.</ref> Three hundred rail-car loads of V-2s and parts were captured and shipped to the United States and 126 of the principal designers, including Wernher von Braun and Walter Dornberger, were in American hands. Von Braun, his brother [[Magnus von Braun]], and seven others decided to surrender to the United States military ([[Operation Paperclip]]) to ensure they were not captured by the advancing Soviets or shot dead by the Nazis to prevent their capture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wernher von Braun |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/vonBraun/vonbraun_3.php |accessdate=4 July 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823183825/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/vonBraun/vonbraun_3.php |archivedate=23 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 1946, the [[British Interplanetary Society]] proposed an enlarged man-carrying version of the V-2, called Megaroc.

[[Operation Paperclip]] recruited German engineers and [[Operation Paperclip#Similar operations|Special Mission V-2]] transported the captured V-2 parts to the United States. At the close of the Second World War, over 300 rail cars filled with V-2 engines, [[fuselage]]s, [[propellant]] tanks, gyroscopes, and associated equipment were brought to the railyards in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], so they could be placed on trucks and driven to the [[White Sands Proving Grounds]], also in New Mexico.

In addition to V-2 hardware, the U.S. Government delivered German mechanization equations for the V-2 guidance, navigation, and control systems, as well as for advanced development concept vehicles, to U.S. defence contractors for analysis. In the 1950s some of these documents were useful to U.S. contractors in developing direction cosine matrix transformations and other inertial navigation architecture concepts that were applied to early U.S. programs such as the Atlas and Minuteman guidance systems as well as the Navy's Subs Inertial Navigation System.<ref>{{cite web|title=V2 Information|url=http://v2.x-factorial.com/|work=X-Factorial.com|accessdate=14 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214234047/http://v2.x-factorial.com/|archivedate=14 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

A committee was formed with military and civilian scientists to review payload proposals for the reassembled V-2 rockets.<ref>By January 1946, the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps invited civilian scientists and engineers to participate in developing a space research program using the V-2.

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] attempted to launch a German V-2 rocket at sea—one test launch from the aircraft carrier [[USS Midway (CV-41)|USS ''Midway'']] was performed on 6 September 1947 as part of the Navy's [[Operation Sandy]]. The test launch was a partial success; the V-2 went off the pad but splashed down in the ocean only some {{cvt|10|km|0}} from the carrier. The launch setup on the Midway's deck is notable in that it used foldaway arms to prevent the missile from falling over. The arms pulled away just after the engine ignited, releasing the missile. The setup may look similar to the [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] launch procedure but in the case of the R-7 the trusses hold the full weight of the rocket, rather than just reacting to side forces.

The [[PGM-11 Redstone]] rocket is a direct descendant of the V-2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |title=Redstone rocket |publisher=centennialofflight.net |accessdate=27 April 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220003451/http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In parallel, Soviet work was focused on larger missiles, the [[R-2 (missile)|R-2]] and [[R-5 (missile)|R-5]], based on further developing the V-2 technology with using ideas of the German concept studies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://profpaulcutter.com/PDF/Hi-tech%20Studies/Helmut_Groettrup.pdf|title=Helmut Groettrup … the captured Russian who was Russian POW rocket scientist|date=29 September 2009|access-date=2019-05-19|last=Cutter|first=Paul|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227085755/http://profpaulcutter.com/PDF/Hi-tech%20Studies/Helmut_Groettrup.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Details of Soviet achievements were unknown to the German team and completely underestimated by Western intelligence until, in November 1957, the [[Sputnik 1]] satellite was successfully launched to orbit by the [[Sputnik (rocket)|Sputnik]] rocket based on [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]], the world's first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Spying on Science: Western Intelligence in Divided Germany 1945–1961 |last=Maddrell |first=Paul |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=February 2006 |isbn=978-0-19-926750-7 |language=en }}</ref>

In the autumn of 1945, the group led by M. Tikhonravov K. and N. G. Chernyshov at NII-4 rocket artillery institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences developed on their own initiative the first stratospheric rocket project.
