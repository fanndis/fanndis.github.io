== Military career ==

[[File:Qasem Soleiman in NAC conference.jpg|thumb|left|General Soleimani in the NAC, a conference of generals of Iran]]
Soleimani joined the Revolutionary Guard ([[IRGC]]) in 1979 following the [[Iranian Revolution]], which saw the Shah fall and [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] take power. Reportedly, his training was minimal, but he advanced rapidly. Early in his career as a guardsman, he was stationed in northwestern Iran, and participated in the suppression of a Kurdish separatist uprising in [[West Azerbaijan Province]].<ref name=filkins />

On 22 September 1980, when [[Saddam Hussein]] launched an invasion of Iran, setting off the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–1988), Soleimani joined the battlefield serving as the leader of a military company, consisting of men from Kerman whom he assembled and trained.<ref name="almonitor-eingma" /> He quickly earned a reputation for bravery,<ref name="thedailybeast">{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/02/iran-s-top-spy-is-the-modern-day-karla-john-le-carr-s-villainous-mastermind.html|title=Iran's Top Spy Is the Modern-Day Karla, John Le Carré's Villainous Mastermind|first=Michael|last=Weiss|date=2 July 2014|newspaper=The Daily Beast|access-date=14 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621192945/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/02/iran-s-top-spy-is-the-modern-day-karla-john-le-carr-s-villainous-mastermind.html|archive-date=21 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and rose through the ranks because of his role in successful operations to retake the lands Iraq had occupied, and eventually became the commander of the [[41st Tharallah Division]] while still in his 20s, participating in most major operations.

Soleimani helped arrange a ceasefire between the Iraqi Army and [[Mahdi Army]] in March 2008.<ref name="mcclatchy" />

Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, senior U.S. State Department official [[Ryan Crocker]] flew to Geneva to meet with Iranian diplomats who were under the leadership of Soleimani with the purpose of collaborating to destroy the [[Taliban]].<ref name=filkins /> This collaboration was instrumental in defining the targets of air bombing operations in Afghanistan and in capturing key [[Al-Qaeda]] operatives, but suddenly ended in January 2002, when President [[George W.

Soleimani strengthened the relationship between Quds Force and Hezbollah upon his appointment, and supported the latter by sending in operatives to retake southern Lebanon.<ref name=filkins /> In an interview aired in October 2019, he said he was in Lebanon during the [[2006 Israel–Hezbollah War]] to manage the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/oct/14/soleimani-mastermind-iran%E2%80%99s-expansion|title=Soleimani: Mastermind of Iran's Expansion|website=The Iran Primer|date=14 October 2019}}</ref>

He reportedly coordinated the war from a base in [[Damascus]] at which a Lebanese [[Hezbollah]] commander and an Iraqi Shia militia coordinator were mobilized, in addition to Syrian and Iranian officers.

==== Orchestration of military escalation in 2015 ====

In 2015, Soleimani began gathering support from various sources to combat the newly resurgent [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) and rebel groups which had both successfully taken large swaths of territory from Assad's forces. He was reportedly the main architect of the joint intervention involving Russia as a new partner with Assad and Hezbollah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hngn.com/articles/137599/20151007/iranian-general-attended-moscow-meeting-to-plan-syrian-assault.htm|title=Iranian General Attended Moscow Meeting To Plan Syrian Assault|work=Headlines & Global News|date=7 October 2015|access-date=16 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208152907/http://www.hngn.com/articles/137599/20151007/iranian-general-attended-moscow-meeting-to-plan-syrian-assault.htm|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="reuters.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/06/us-mideast-crisis-syria-soleimani-insigh-idUSKCN0S02BV20151006|title=How Iranian general plotted out Syrian assault in Moscow|publisher=Reuters|date=6 October 2015|access-date=1 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009193524/http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/06/us-mideast-crisis-syria-soleimani-insigh-idUSKCN0S02BV20151006|archive-date=9 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to [[Reuters]], at a meeting in Moscow in July, Soleimani unfurled a map of Syria to explain to his Russian hosts how a series of defeats for President Bashar al-Assad could be turned into victory—with Russia's help. Soleimani's visit to Moscow was the first step in planning for a Russian military intervention that has reshaped the Syrian war and forged a new [[Russia–Syria–Iran–Iraq coalition|Iran–Russia alliance]] in support of the Syrian (and Iraqi) governments. Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, also sent a senior envoy to Moscow to meet President Vladimir Putin. "Putin reportedly told [a senior Iranian envoy] 'Okay we will intervene. Send Qassem Soleimani.'" General Soleimani went to explain the map of the theatre and coordinate the strategic escalation of military forces in Syria.<ref name="reuters.com"/>

Soleimani had a decisive impact on the theater of operations, which led to a strong advance in southern Aleppo with the government and allied forces re-capturing two military bases and dozens of towns and villages in a matter of weeks. There was also a series of major [[Kuweires offensive (September–November 2015)|advances towards Kuweiris air-base]] to the north-east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/10/syria-aleppo-conquest-regime-armed-rebels.html|title=What the Aleppo offensive hides|date=23 October 2015|last=Alami|first=Mona|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=24 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719080927/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/10/syria-aleppo-conquest-regime-armed-rebels.html|archive-date=19 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> By mid-November, the Syrian army and its allies had gained ground in southern areas of Aleppo Governorate, capturing numerous rebel strongholds.

The city fell to ISIL during 2014 when ISIL made immense gains in northern and central Iraq. After its capture, ISIL's [[Camp Speicher massacre|massacre at Camp Speicher]] led to 1,600 to 1,700 deaths of Iraqi Army cadets and soldiers. After months of careful preparation and intelligence gathering an offensive to encircle and capture Tikrit was launched in early March 2015.<ref name="independent.co.uk" />

In 2016, photos published by a Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) source showed Soleimani attending a meeting of PMF commanders in Iraq to discuss the [[Battle of Fallujah (2016)|Battle of Fallujah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.farsnews.com/imgrep.aspx?nn=13950304001274|title=Iran's Gen.

CIA chief [[Mike Pompeo]] said he sent Soleimani and other Iranian leaders a letter holding them responsible for any attacks on U.S. interests by forces under their control. According to [[Mohammad Mohammadi Golpayegani]], a senior aide for Iran's supreme leader, Soleimani ignored the letter when it was handed over to him during the [[2017 Abu Kamal offensive|Abu Kamal offensive]] against ISIL, saying "I will not take your letter nor read it and I have nothing to say to these people."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-pompeo/cia-chief-pompeo-says-he-warned-irans-soleimani-over-iraq-aggression-idUSKBN1DX02P|title=CIA chief Pompeo says he warned Iran's Soleimani over Iraq aggression|date=2017|work=Reuters|access-date=3 December 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203051441/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-pompeo/cia-chief-pompeo-says-he-warned-irans-soleimani-over-iraq-aggression-idUSKBN1DX02P|archive-date=3 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/03/cia-director-sent-warning-to-iran-over-threatened-us-interests-in-iraq|title=CIA director sent warning to Iran over threatened US interests in Iraq|date=3 December 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=3 December 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203175343/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/03/cia-director-sent-warning-to-iran-over-threatened-us-interests-in-iraq|archive-date=3 December 2017|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

In 1999, Soleimani, along with other senior IRGC commanders, signed a letter to then-President [[Mohammad Khatami]] regarding the [[Iran student protests, July 1999|student protests in July]]. They wrote "Dear Mr. Khatami, how long do we have to shed tears, sorrow over the events, practice democracy by chaos and insults, and have revolutionary patience at the expense of sabotaging the system? Dear president, if you don't make a revolutionary decision and act according to your Islamic and national missions, tomorrow will be so late and irrecoverable that cannot be even imagined."<ref name="IPD" />

===Legal status of the assassination===
The strike was not approved by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] or consented to by the Iraqi government, leading to controversy regarding the legality of killing an Iranian military leader over Iraqi airspace.<ref>[https://iran-attack-donald-trump-order-assassinate-iran-qassem-soleimani-was-it-legal Iran attack: Was it legal to assassinate Qassem Soleimani under international law?], ''[[Sunday Express]]'', Kaisha Langton, 5 January 2020. Retrieved 11 January 2020.</ref>

====Under U.S. law====
On 14 February 2020, in a legally required unclassified memorandum to Congress,<ref>[https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/4/3/4362ca46-3a7d-43e8-a3ec-be0245705722/6E1A0F30F9204E380A7AD0C84EC572EC.doc148.pdf Qassem Soleimani] foreignaffairs.house.gov</ref> the Trump administration said it was authorized under both the Constitution and the 2002 Authorization of Use of Military Force Against Iraq. 

However, the Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs Engel said "The 2002 authorization was passed to deal with Saddam Hussein. This law had nothing to do with Iran or Iranian government officials in Iraq. To suggest that 18 years later this authorization could justify killing an Iranian official stretches the law far beyond anything Congress ever intended," adding that he "looked forward" to Pompeo testifying in a 28 February hearing.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/02/timeline-trump-shifting-justifications-soliemani-killing-200217222143105.html|title=Timeline of Trump's shifting justifications for Soleimani killing|publisher =AlJazeera|date=18 February 2020|access-date = 18 February 2020}}</ref>

====Under international law====
The United States, as a member of the United Nations, has ratified the [[Charter of the United Nations]] and, therefore, is bound by its provisions. [[Agnes Callamard]], [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and Director of [[Columbia University]]'s Global Freedom of Expression project, researched the alleged legal basis for the killing of Suleimani advanced by the United States government and stated that the Suleimani's killing could have been justified under international law only if it had been a response to an "imminent threat." However, she said that the United States had provided no evidence to support that contention.  "Absent an actual imminent threat to life, the course of action taken by the U.S. was unlawful," Ms. Callamard wrote in a report that she presented in July 2020 to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.<ref>New York Times, 9 July 2020 [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/world/middleeast/qassim-suleimani-killing-unlawful.html?referringSource=articleShare "The Killing of Qassim Suleimani Was Unlawful, Says U.N. Expert: The United States Provided No Evidence that Its Fatal January Drone Strike against General Suleimani Was in Response to an Imminent Threat, Said a United Nations Special Rapporteur"] </ref>  The Trump administration's February 2020 memorandum to Congress was "remarkably vague and inconsequential as far as a possible imminent threat is concerned," Ms. Callamard wrote in the report. "Even at the most basic level, the U.S. did not demonstrate that striking Suleimani was ‘necessary.’"<ref>New York Times, 9 July 2020 [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/world/middleeast/qassim-suleimani-killing-unlawful.html?referringSource=articleShare "The Killing of Qassim Suleimani Was Unlawful, Says U.N. Expert: The United States Provided No Evidence that Its Fatal January Drone Strike against General Suleimani Was in Response to an Imminent Threat, Said a United Nations Special Rapporteur"] </ref>

Callamard also concluded that the killing sets an alarming precedent—it was the first targeted drone killing of a senior foreign government official on the territory of a third country. The world now faced "the very real prospect that states may opt to ‘strategically’ eliminate high-ranking military officials outside the context of a ‘known’ war, and seek to justify the killing on the grounds of the target's classification as a ‘terrorist’ who posed a potential future threat," Ms. Callamard said in her report. Also, she noted that scores of countries and many non-state actors now have operational drones, and that drones kill many non-combatants for every person targeted.<ref>New York Times, 9 July 2020 [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/world/middleeast/qassim-suleimani-killing-unlawful.html?referringSource=articleShare "The Killing of Qassim Suleimani Was Unlawful, Says U.N. Expert: The United States Provided No Evidence that Its Fatal January Drone Strike against General Suleimani Was in Response to an Imminent Threat, Said a United Nations Special Rapporteur"] </ref> 

In an article in the [[Middle East Institute]], former Deputy Defense Secretary for the Middle East [[Michael Mulroy]] and retired Navy SEAL Eric Oehlerich state that the [[targeted killing]] of Soleimani was justified and long overdue because he was an enemy combatant who orchestrated a lethal campaign against U.S. military, diplomats and intelligence officers in Iraq. However, they also made the point that the U.S. should have targeted Soleimani's subordinates to disrupt their operations and that covert authorities should have been considered to be able to deny the operation in order to avoid the possibility of an all-out regional war.<ref>[https://www.mei.edu/publications/killing-qassem-soleimani-was-there-better-way The killing of Qassem Soleimani: Was there a better way?] mei.edu</ref>
