Born in the [[South Jamaica, Queens|South Jamaica]] neighborhood of [[Queens]], Jackson began selling drugs at age 12 during the [[crack epidemic in the United States|1980s crack epidemic]]. He later began pursuing a musical career and in 2000 he produced ''[[Power of the Dollar]]'' for [[Columbia Records]], but days before the planned release he was shot and the album was never released. In 2002, after Jackson released the compilation album ''[[Guess Who's Back?]]'', he was discovered by [[Eminem]] and signed to [[Shady Records]], under the aegis of [[Dr. Dre]]'s [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and [[Interscope Records]].

With the aid of Eminem and Dr. Dre (who produced his first major-label album ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin']]''), Jackson became one of the world's best selling rappers and rose to prominence with [[East Coast hip hop]] group [[G-Unit]] (which he leads de facto). In 2003, he founded [[G-Unit Records]], signing his G-Unit associates [[Young Buck]], [[Lloyd Banks]] and [[Tony Yayo]]. Jackson had similar commercial and critical success with his second album, ''[[The Massacre]]'', which was released in 2005. He released his fifth studio album, ''[[Animal Ambition]]'', in 2014 and as of 2019 is working on his sixth studio album, ''[[Street King Immortal]]''. He executive-produces and stars in the show ''[[Power (TV series)|Power]]'', which airs on [[Starz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ir.starz.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=982143 |title=Starz announces it extended Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson's exclusive premium overall deal |date=August 1, 2016 |access-date=October 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018223259/http://ir.starz.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=982143 |archive-date=October 18, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

One of Jackson's first business ventures was a partnership with [[Energy Brands|Glacéau]] to create an [[enhanced water]] drink called Formula 50. In October 2004, Jackson became a beverage investor when he was given a minority share in the company in exchange for becoming a spokesperson after learning that he was a fan of the beverage. The health conscious Jackson noted that he first learned of the product while at a gym in Los Angeles, and stated that "they do such a good job making water taste good." After becoming a minority shareholder and celebrity spokesperson, Jackson worked with the company to create a new grape flavored "Formula 50" variant of VitaminWater and mentioned the drinks in various songs and interviews. In 2007, [[Coca-Cola]] purchased Glacéau for $4.1&nbsp;billion and, according to ''[[Forbes]]'', Jackson, who was a minority shareholder, earned $100&nbsp;million from the deal after taxes.<ref>Goldman, Lea (September 30, 2007).

===Lawsuits===

====Use of image====
Jackson filed a lawsuit against an advertising company, Traffix of [[Pearl River, New York]], on July 21, 2007, for using his image in a promotion he said threatened his safety. He was alerted by a staff member to an Internet advertisement on a [[Myspace]] page. According to court documents, the advertisement had a cartoon image of the rapper with "Shoot the rapper and you will win $5000 or five ring tones guaranteed". Although the ad did not use his name, the image allegedly resembled him and suggested that he endorsed the product. The lawsuit, calling the ad a "vile, tasteless and despicable" use of Jackson's image which "quite literally call[ed] for violence against him", sought unspecified [[punitive damages]] and a permanent injunction against the use of his image without permission.<ref>{{cite news |author=CBC Arts |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/07/21/50cent-lawsuit-ad.html? |title=50 Cent says ad threatens his life, files lawsuit |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=July 21, 2007 |accessdate=December 8, 2012 |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127011438/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/07/21/50cent-lawsuit-ad.html |archive-date=November 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070911043335/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007Jul20/0%2C4670%2CPeople50Cent%2C00.html 50 Cent Sues over 'Shoot the Rapper'].

In 2008, Jackson sued [[Taco Bell]] over an ad campaign in which it invited him to change his name for one day from 50 Cent to 79 Cent, 89 Cent, or 99 Cent, in line with pricing for some of its items, and they would donate $10,000 to the charity of his choice. The case was settled out of court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Trademark|title=Trademark / Useful Notes|website=TV Tropes|access-date=2019-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105094251/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Trademark|archive-date=January 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Janitor incident====
While walking through [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]] in May 2016, Jackson harassed and insulted a janitor at the airport, accusing him of being [[Altered state of consciousness|under the influence]]. The janitor was a hearing-impaired, [[autistic]] teenager named Andrew Farrell. The parents of the janitor had seen the viral video as disrespect and wanted to sue Jackson for his action against their child. The lawsuit was originally over one million dollars, but the parents settled for a $100,000 donation to [[Autism Speaks]] and his apology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dlisted.com/2016/05/05/making-fun-of-an-autistic-janitor-cost-50-cent-100000/|title=Making Fun Of An Autistic Janitor Cost 50 Cent $100,000|date=May 5, 2016|access-date=May 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508050009/http://dlisted.com/2016/05/05/making-fun-of-an-autistic-janitor-cost-50-cent-100000/|archive-date=May 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hot1061.com/50-cent-makes-fun-of-autistic-teen/ |title=50 CENT MAKES FUN OF AUTISTIC TEEN |website=Hot1061.com |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521194448/http://www.hot1061.com/50-cent-makes-fun-of-autistic-teen/ |date=May 3, 2016|archive-date=May 21, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.datalounge.com/thread/16865038-50-cent-insults-a-kid-with-autism-|title=50 Cent "insults" a kid with autism|website=Datalounge|access-date=May 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513001809/https://www.datalounge.com/thread/16865038-50-cent-insults-a-kid-with-autism-|archive-date=May 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/05/50-cent-autism-tweet_n_1651256.html|title=50 Cent Faces Backlash Over Offensive Autism Tweets|date=July 5, 2012|website=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=May 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518053602/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/05/50-cent-autism-tweet_n_1651256.html|archive-date=May 18, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/50-cent-donates-100000-to-autism-speaks-after-mocking-teen-with-autism_us_572b7ddbe4b016f37894f190|title=50 Cent Donates $100,000 To Autism Speaks After Mocking Teen|first=Julia|last=Brucculieri|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=May 5, 2016|access-date=June 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508232206/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/50-cent-donates-100000-to-autism-speaks-after-mocking-teen-with-autism_us_572b7ddbe4b016f37894f190|archive-date=May 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

An [[affidavit]] by an [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) agent suggested ties between Murder Inc. and [[Kenneth McGriff|Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff]], a New York drug lord suspected of involvement in the murder of [[Jam Master Jay]] and Jackson's shooting. An excerpt read:

{{quote|The investigation has uncovered a conspiracy involving McGriff and others to murder a rap artist who has released songs containing lyrics regarding McGriff's criminal activities. The rap artist was shot in 2000, survived and thereafter refused to cooperate with law enforcement regarding the shooting. Messages transmitted over the Murder Inc. pager indicate that McGriff is involved in an ongoing plot to kill this rap artist, and that he communicates with Murder Inc. employees concerning the target.<ref name=TSG/>}}

The end of the Jackson-Ja Rule feud was confirmed in May 2011. According to Ja Rule, "I'm cool. We ain't beefing no more. We'll never collaborate. That's just what it is. You don't have to be at war with somebody, but it's also kind of like U.S. and another country that they may not get along with. We don't gotta go to war, but we're not friends either. But we can coincide inside of a world.

===The Game===
Although Jackson was close to [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] before the latter released his debut album, ''The Documentary'', they grew apart. After ''The Documentary''{{'}}s release, Jackson felt that The Game was disloyal for saying that he did not want to participate in G-Unit's feuds with other rappers (such as [[Nas]], [[Jadakiss]] and [[Fat Joe]]) and his desire to work with artists with which G-Unit was feuding. He said that he wrote six songs for the album and did not receive proper credit, which The Game denied.<ref>Reid, Shaheem (March 1, 2005).

Before leaving for Venezuela, Jackson uploaded a video ("Warning Shot") and the first of a series of "Officer Ricky" cartoons.
