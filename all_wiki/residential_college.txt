A '''residential college''' is a division of a [[university]] that places academic activity in a [[community]] setting of students and faculty, usually at a [[halls of residence|residence]] and with shared meals, the college having a degree of autonomy and a [[federalism|federated]] relationship with the overall university. The term ''residential college'' is also used to describe a variety of other patterns, ranging from a [[dormitory]] with some academic programming, to [[continuing education]] programs for adults lasting a few days. In some parts of the world it simply refers to any organized on-campus housing, an example being [[University of Malaya]].<ref>"[http://www.um.edu.my/um_life/services/accommodation/residential_colleges.php?intPrefLangID=1& Residential college]". University of Malaya.</ref>

==Various models of residential college==

A prominent model for residential colleges is the colleges of the [[University of Oxford]]<ref name="ox.ac.uk">{{cite web 
|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/colleges/ |title=Oxford University Colleges and Halls |accessdate=2007-01-02 |work=Oxford University web site

J. O'Hara|date=20 December 2004|accessdate=29 February 2016|website=The Collegiate Way}}</ref> With the arrival of residential colleges in the [[United States]] the model diversified further. The Durham adaptation of colleges being owned by the university rather than being independent corporations is generally followed<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Times Higher Education|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/pasta-with-a-side-order-of-philosophy-please/190727.article?storyCode=190727&sectioncode=26|title=Pasta with a side order of philosophy, please|date=20 August 2004|quote=Although the historical roots of collegiate organisation are to be found in [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] universities, the corporate independence of Oxbridge colleges is not likely to be reproduced elsewhere.

There is also a split between fully collegiate universities (e.g. the [[University of Notre Dame]], where all freshmen are put in a residential college) and those (e.g. [[Northwestern University]]<ref name="Northwestern University Residential Colleges">{{Cite web | url=http://www.northwestern.edu/residentialcolleges/ | title=Residential Colleges | accessdate=2014-03-20 | work=Northwestern University website | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206092900/http://www.northwestern.edu/residentialcolleges/ | archivedate=2014-02-06 }}</ref>) where not all students are members of colleges. Another variant at some US universities is residential colleges that do not cover all years at the institute, e.g. [[Princeton University]]'s system of paired four-year and two-year residential colleges,<ref name="princeton.edu">{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/campuslife/housingdining/colleges/ |title=Residential Colleges |accessdate=2010-03-11 |work=Princeton University Website}}</ref> or [[Cornell University]]'s West Campus House System, which only takes [[sophomore]]s and above,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://westcampushousesystem.cornell.edu|title=West Campus House System|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref> with most [[upperclassman|upperclassmen]] either living off campus or in dorms unaffiliated with the residential colleges. Another point of variance is whether colleges are multi-disciplinary (as at Oxford and Cambridge) or focused on certain subject areas such as at [[Fordham University]], which has dedicated residential colleges (Integrated Learning Communities) for upperclassmen for various themes including global business and science, as well as separate freshman residential colleges, including one for students considering pre-med or science majors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/info/21226/living_and_learning_integrated_learning_communities|title=Living and Learning: Integrated Learning Communities|publisher=Fordham University|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref>

The primary difference between a residential college and a dormitory is often considered to be that while a student lives in a dormitory for a year, they are a member of a college for their entire student life, even when not living in the dormitories associated with that college: "Residential colleges are collegia in the original sense: societies, not buildings, and their members may reside anywhere".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegiateway.org/howto/membership/#section-1.3|at=1.3 Residential College Junior Members|website=The Collegiate Way|title=How to Build a Residential College|author=Robert J. O'Hara|accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref> However, as can be seen above, this is not common to all variants of the residential college system. In addition, the members of a residential college are usually expected to eat their meals together, as a unified body. Standard dormitories tend to have residents who move between dorm complexes every year, and who eat in dining halls largely mixed with residents of other dormitories. However, residential colleges can be self-catering (e.g. [[Josephine Butler College, Durham]]), yet still clearly identified as colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegiateway.org/news/2006-what-is-a-college|title=What is a Residential College?|website=The Collegiate Way|accessdate=29 February 2016|author=R. J. O'Hara|date=31 July 2006}}</ref>

==United States== 
In the United States, as in many collegiate universities in the UK, the academic and residential functions of the residential college system are normally separated, with the colleges primarily as residential and social units. Although residential colleges in some universities offer some classes, these offerings supplement the offerings of the major academic which have separate facilities. Other US institutions not mentioned above that have residential colleges include

==United Kingdom and Ireland==
{{see also|Colleges within universities in the United Kingdom}}
Collegiate structures in the [[British Isles]] follow a variety of models. In [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]], a residential college combines both the residential and part of the academic aspects of the university in one location. Tutorials (Oxford) or Supervisions (Cambridge) are generally given within the college, but lectures are organised by the wider university. In most universities in the UK with residential colleges – [[Durham University|Durham]] (from the 19th century) along with [[University of Kent|Kent]], [[University of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[University of York|York]] (from the 1960s) – formal teaching is carried out only in academic departments. Their colleges are primarily residential and the focus for social and sporting activities, as well as for student welfare. In these universities, the colleges are (with the exception of two early 20th century colleges at Durham) owned by their parent university; this is also the case for two of the newer colleges at Oxford, which are formally "societies" of the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/statutes/782-121.shtml|title=Statute V: Colleges, Societies, and Permanent Private Halls|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref> The [[University of Roehampton]] has four colleges (all founded in the 19th century) that joined to form the University. The teaching of the University takes place within the colleges, with academic departments being associated with a particular college. Roehampton colleges are, therefore, both residential and academic, but with the academic organisation on very different lines from Oxford and Cambridge. The [[University of London]] and the [[University of the Highlands and Islands]] are federal universities whose colleges are independent teaching institutes (some, in the case of London, being essentially world-leading universities in their own right) rather than residential colleges. The [[University of the Arts London]] is similarly organised, with six constituent teaching colleges, except that these are all owned by the central University rather than being joined in a federal structure. The [[University of Dublin]] (founded 1592) in [[Ireland]] has only one constituent college, [[Trinity College, Dublin]], which is thus effectively the whole University rather than a residential college. The [[University of St Andrews]] in Scotland contains three colleges, but these have neither a teaching nor residential role.

==Canada==
Many universities in [[Canada]] have collegiate systems similar to those in British collegiate universities. For instance, the [[University of Toronto]] and [[York University]] have a well-established collegiate system including a number of "federated colleges" and "constituent colleges". Initially, the [[University of Victoria]] maintained a system of residential colleges (including Craigdarroch College and Lansdowne College) built around central courtyards, before adopting a more centralized residential system which is now made up of Permanent Halls (eg., Ring Road Hall) and Common Rooms. Other Canadian universities with residential colleges include the [[University of Waterloo]], the [[University of Western Ontario]], the [[University of Manitoba]], the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Trent University]] and its colleges, [[Paton College]] at [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]. Three Canadian residential colleges are distinguished by being for graduate students rather than undergraduates &mdash; [[Green College, University of British Columbia|Green College, Vancouver]] and [[St. John's College, University of British Columbia|St. John's College, Vancouver]] colleges at UBC, and [[Massey College|Massey College, Toronto]] at the University of Toronto.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], colleges perform different functions at different universities. Colleges at the [[University of Melbourne]] and the [[University of Sydney]] provide academic, sporting and cultural programs in addition to those offered by their parent institution. However, they only serve a small fraction of the university population. By point of comparison, the colleges at the [[Australian National University]] and [[Monash University]] focus on the provision of accommodation.

==New Zealand== 
Residential colleges or Halls of Residence in New Zealand are common across the country's universities, particular for housing first year students. [[University of Auckland]] has 6 ''Halls'', while [[University of Otago]] in [[Dunedin]] has a particular strong set of colleges modelled on the Oxbridge system. Each of Otago's 15 colleges has its own distinctive 'personality', history, and traditions. 

==India==
In India, [[G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology|Pantnagar University]] is an example of a residential college.
<p>[[Banaras Hindu University]] claims to be largest residential University in Asia.</p>

==Experiences with the residential college model==

Because of the many interpretations of the residential college concept, and its use at many universities and institutions, there are many experiences of how the concept plays out at various times and at various institutions. Some particularly illustrative experiences are summarised here.

With only three residential colleges for graduate students in Canada &mdash; [[Green College, University of British Columbia|Green]] and [[St. John's College, University of British Columbia|St. John's Colleges]] at the University of British Columbia, and [[Massey College]] at the University of Toronto &mdash; there is a sense that part of the work of these colleges is to explore a Canadian approach to the residential college model, and "to blend quality and prestige on the one hand, and enrichment of the campus on the other, while avoiding elitism or imitation".<ref name="greencollege.ubc.ca">{{cite web |url=http://www.greencollege.ubc.ca/About/l-purpose.htm |title=Purpose of the College |author=Green College, UBC |authorlink=Green College, University of British Columbia |accessdate=2007-01-02 |work=Green College UBC website |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004060610/http://www.greencollege.ubc.ca/About/l-purpose.htm |archivedate=2006-10-04 }}</ref>

In 1999 the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] took stock of its housing system, and studied a variety of residence models in "Reinventing residence life @ MIT".<ref name="MIT 1999">{{cite web

In [[Italy]], the residential college model was adopted in 2003 by all of [[Milan]] universities, according to a joint program developed in collaboration with several private and public institutions, such as [[Microsoft]] and the Lombardy Region, at the Collegio di Milano.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In [[South Korea]], the residential college system was first adopted by [[Wonju]] campus of [[Yonsei University]] in 2007 and later extended to [[Songdo International Business District|Songdo]] campus in 2013. Due to the lack of housing available to the students, only the freshmen year participate in the residential college.  Wonju campus operates 7 houses and the residential college campus in [[Songdo International Business District|Songdo]] operates 12 houses.

There is another residential college in GIST(Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology) College at Gwangju, South Korea. The house system is a dormitory system being implemented at Caltech, Harvard, etc. in which a number of small-scale residential communities are formed within the dormitories to link studies and life together. GIST College has gained positive outcomes in undergraduate students’ dormitory life as well as university life as a whole.
