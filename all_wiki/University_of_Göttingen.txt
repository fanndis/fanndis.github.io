The '''University of Göttingen''', officially the '''Georg August University of Göttingen''', ({{lang-de|Georg-August-Universität Göttingen}}, known informally as '''Georgia Augusta''') is a [[public research university]] in the city of [[Göttingen]], Germany. Founded in 1734 by [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], King of Great Britain and Elector of [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]], and starting classes in 1737, the Georgia Augusta was conceived to promote the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. It is the oldest university in the state of [[Lower Saxony]] and the largest in student enrollment, which stands at around 31,600.

Home to many [[List of Georg-August University of Göttingen people|noted figures]], it represents one of Germany's historic and traditional institutions. As of October 2020, [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|44 Nobel Prize winners]] have been affiliated with the University of Göttingen as alumni, faculty members or researchers.

The University of Göttingen was previously supported by the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]], holds memberships to the [[U15 (German Universities)|U15 Group]] of major German research universities and to the [[Coimbra Group]] of major European research universities. Furthermore, the university maintains strong connections with major research institutes based in Göttingen, such as those of the [[Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science]] and the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]]. With approximately 9 million media units, the [[Göttingen State and University Library]] ranks among the largest libraries in Germany.

==History==
[[File:George II of Great Britain - 1730-50.jpg|thumb|upright|King George II, founder and president of the university|left]]

=== Inauguration ===
In 1734, King [[George II of Great Britain]], who was also [[Elector of Hanover]], gave his Prime Minister in Hanover, Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen, the order to establish a university in Göttingen to propagate the ideas and values associated with the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

Initially, the only new buildings constructed for the opening of the university were a [[riding hall]] and a [[fencing]] house, while courses were taught in the [[Paulinerkirche, Göttingen|Paulinerkirche]] and associated [[Dominican order|Dominican]] monastery, or in the homes of professors. No university auditorium was built until well into the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}[[File:Goettingen - Innenansicht Paulinerkirche (1748).png|thumb|upright|King George II in the Pauliner Church in 1748|alt=|left]]

===18th–19th centuries===
Throughout the remainder of the 18th century the University of Göttingen was in the top rank of German universities, with its free spirit and atmosphere of scientific exploration and research. Famously, [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]] was the first to hold a professorship (1769–99) explicitly dedicated to experimental physics in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} By 1812, Göttingen had become an internationally acknowledged modern university with a library of more than 200,000 volumes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Goettingen Uni Ansicht 01.jpg|thumb]]

In the first years of the University of Göttingen, it became known especially for its [[Göttingen University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]. In the 18th century [[Johann Stephan Pütter]], a scholar of public law at that time, taught [[jus publicum]] for half a century. The subject had attracted students such as [[Klemens Wenzel Lothar von Metternich]], later diplomat and Prime Minister of Austria, and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], who later established the [[University of Berlin]]. In 1809 [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], the German philosopher best known for his work ''The World as Will and Representation'', became a student at the university, where he studied [[metaphysics]] and [[psychology]] under [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], who advised him to concentrate on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} By the university's centenary in 1837, it was known as the "university of law," as the students enrolled by the faculty of law often made up more than half of the university's students. Göttingen became a Mecca for the study of public law in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

During this time, the University of Göttingen achieved renown for its critical work on history as well. An Enlightenment institution, it produced the [[Göttingen School of History]].
[[File:Göttinger Kneiperei um 1816.jpg|thumb]]
However, political disturbances, in which both professors and students were implicated, lowered the attendance to 860 in 1834. The expulsion in 1837 of the seven professors – the so-called ''Die [[Göttinger Sieben]]'' (the Germanist [[Wilhelm Eduard Albrecht]] (1800–1876), the historian [[Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann]] (1785–1860), the orientalist [[Georg Heinrich August Ewald]] (1803–1875), the historian [[Georg Gottfried Gervinus]] (1805–1875), the physicist [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] (1804–1891), and the philologist brothers [[Jakob Grimm|Jakob]] (1785–1863) and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] (1786–1859)) – for protesting against the revocation by [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]], of the liberal constitution of 1833 further reduced the prosperity of the university.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Otto von Bismarck]], the main creator and the first Chancellor of the second [[German Empire]], had also studied law in Göttingen in 1833: he lived in a tiny house on the "Wall," now known as "Bismarck Cottage". According to oral tradition, he lived there because his rowdiness had caused him to be banned from living within the city walls.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Turn of the 20th Century===
[[File:Göttingen Aula May06.jpg|thumb|Alte Aula (''Great Hall''), also [[Karzer]], at Wilhelmsplatz (built in 1835–1837)|alt=|left]]At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, the University of Göttingen achieved its academic peak. Göttingen maintained a strong focus on natural science, especially mathematics. By 1900, [[David Hilbert]] and [[Felix Klein]] had attracted mathematicians from around the world to Göttingen, which made it a leading center of mathematics by the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Likewise, the [[Faculty of Theology, University of Göttingen|Faculty of Theology]] in conjunction with other orientalists and ancient historians across the university became an international center for the study of religion and antiquity.
[[File:Göttingen Aula Konzert Händelfestspiele 2005.jpg|thumb|The interior of the university Aula|alt=|left]]In 1903, its teaching staff numbered 121 and its students 1529. [[Ludwig Prandtl]] joined the university in 1904, and developed it into a leader in [[fluid mechanics]] and in [[aerodynamics]] over the next two decades. In 1925, Prandtl was appointed as the director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] for Fluid Mechanics. He introduced the concept of [[boundary layer]] and founded mathematical aerodynamics by calculating air flow in the down wind direction. Many of Prandtl's students went on to make fundamental contributions to aerodynamics.

From 1921 to 1933, the physics theory group was led by [[Max Born]], who, during this time, became one of the three discoverers of the non-relativistic theory of [[quantum mechanics]]. He may also have been the first to propose its probabilistic relationship with classical physics. It was one of the main centers of the development of [[modern physics]].

During this time, the German language became an international academic language. A number of dissertations in the UK and the US had German titles. One might be considered having had a complete academic training only when one had studied in Germany. Thus, many American students were proud of having studied in Germany, and the University of Göttingen had profound impacts on the US. A number of American politicians, lawyers, historians and writers received their education from both [[Harvard]] and Göttingen. For example, [[Edward Everett]], once [[Secretary of State]] and President of [[Harvard University]], stayed in Göttingen for two years of study. [[George Ticknor]] spent two years studying classics in Göttingen. Even [[John Lothrop Motley]], a diplomat and historian, had personal friendship with Otto von Bismarck during his two-year-long study in Göttingen. [[George Bancroft]], a politician and historian, received his PhD from the University of Göttingen in 1820.<ref>Deanna Spingola, The Ruling Elite: a Study in Imperialism, Genocide and Emancipation, 2011, p. 92.</ref>[[File:Mathematiker 1920 Göttingen.jpg|thumb|alt=]]

==="Great purge" of 1933===
In the 1930s, the university became a focal point for the [[Nazism|Nazi]] crackdown on "Jewish physics", as represented by the work of [[Albert Einstein]]. In what was later called the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|"great purge" of 1933]], academics including [[Max Born]], [[Victor Goldschmidt]], [[James Franck]], [[Eugene Wigner]], [[Leó Szilárd]], [[Edward Teller]], [[Edmund Landau]], [[Emmy Noether]], and [[Richard Courant]] were expelled or fled. Most of them fled [[Nazi Germany]] for places like the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Following the great purge, in 1934 [[David Hilbert]], by then a symbol of German mathematics, was dining with [[Bernhard Rust]], the Nazi minister of education. Rust asked, “How is mathematics at Göttingen, now that it is free from the Jewish influence?” Hilbert replied, “There is no mathematics in Göttingen anymore.”<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://undark.org/article/math-lesson-hitlers-germany/ |title=The dinner between Hilbert and Rust |accessdate=2018-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114073654/https://undark.org/article/math-lesson-hitlers-germany/ |archive-date=2018-01-14 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Renovation after War===
After [[World War II]], the University of Göttingen was the first university in the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|western Zones]] to be re-opened under British control in 1945.

==Campus==

The university is spread out in several locations around the city.

[[File:Göttingen_train_station_sign.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Sign at Göttingen train station displaying the motto ''Stadt, die Wissen schafft'' ("City that creates knowledge", playing also with the German word "Wissenschaft", English "science").]]The central university complex with the Central Library and ''Mensa'' (student refectory/dining hall) is located right next to the inner city and comprises the faculties for Theology, Social sciences, Law, Economics/Business Administration and Linguistics. The departments of Ancient History, Classics, various languages, Psychology and Philosophy are nearby. Located to the south of the city is the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science with its main building, the Mathematisches Institut, on the same street as the German Aerospace Center and the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organisation. Elsewhere in the city are the departments of Anthropology and Educational Sciences as well as the Medical Faculty with its associated hospitals.

Just north of the city a new scientific center has been built in which most of the natural sciences (Chemistry, Biology, Plant Pathology, Agronomy, Forestry, Geology, Physics, Computer Science) are now located, including the GZMB. Other institutes are set around the inner city.

=== Library ===
[[File:SUB Göttingen.jpg|thumb|Central Library and "Raumskulptur" sculpture]]
Closely linked with the university is the [[Göttingen State and University Library]] (German: Niedersächsische Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen, or SUB Göttingen). With around 9 million media units and precious manuscripts, the library is designed for Göttingen University as well as the central library for the German State of Lower Saxony (with its central catalogue) and for the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, founded as the 'Royal Society for Sciences'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/en/about-us/portrait/|title=Portrait|last=|first=|date=|website=Niedersächsische Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen (SUB)|accessdate=2019-12-18}}</ref>[[File:Universitätsbibliothek der Georg August Uni Göttingen.tif|thumb]]

===Gardens===
The university maintains three botanical gardens: the Alter Botanischer Garten der Universität Göttingen, the Neuer Botanischer Garten der Universität Göttingen, and the Forstbotanischer Garten und Pflanzengeographisches Arboretum der Universität Göttingen.

==Organisation==
[[File:Auditorium Göttingen.jpg|thumb|The old Auditorium Maximum (built in 1826–1865)|alt=|left]]
Today the university consists of 13 faculties and around 31,600<ref name="uni-goettingen.de" /> students are enrolled. More than 400 professors and 4,000 academic staff work at the university, assisted by a technical and administrative staff of over 7,000. The post-war expansion of the university led to the establishment of a new, modern "university quarter" in the north of the city. The architecture of the old university can still be seen in the Auditorium Maximum (1826/1865) and the Great Hall (1835/1837) at Wilhelmsplatz.

=== Faculties, centers, and institutes ===
The University of Göttingen encompasses 13 faculties and a total of 36 additional centers and institutes (including associated centers and institutes but excluding institutes or departments within the faculties themselves).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/31322.html|title=Centres and Institutes|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2019-12-18}}</ref>

Within the framework of the 2006–07 [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]], it won funding for its future concept "Tradition, Innovation, Autonomy," its graduate school "Neurosciences and Molecular Biosciences," and its research cluster "Microscopy at the Nanometer Range." In the 2012 Excellence Initiative, Göttingen succeeded in obtaining funds for its graduate school "Neurosciences and Molecular Biosciences" and its research cluster "Microscopy at the Nanometer Range", but failed in its bid for future concept financing. In September 2018, Göttingen succeeded in gaining funds only for its research cluster "[https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/579892.html Multiscale Bioimaging]", and failed in the other applications. Consequently, Göttingen would no longer be eligible for the fourth round of future concept financing across the country in 2019. 
[[File:Grape - Göttinger Universitäts- und Bibliotheksgebäude 1815.jpg|thumb]]
As of October 2019, the University of Göttingen is associated with [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|45 Nobel laureates]]. By this number alone, the University of Göttingen ranks among global top 15. The most recent Nobel laureates associated with the university are [[Stefan Hell]] ([[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], 2014) and [[Thomas C. Südhof]] ([[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], 2013). Stefan Hell has been a lecturer (in Privatdozent capacity) at the University of Göttingen since 2004 and the director of the [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry]] in the Göttingen Campus since 2002, while Thomas Südhof, currently a professor at [[Stanford University]], worked on his doctoral thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in the lab of British biochemist Victor P. Whittaker.

As of 2020, four out of sixteen in-office Justices of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] ({{lang-de|Bundesverfassungsgericht}}; abbreviated: ''{{lang|de|BVerfG}}''), Germany's [[supreme court|supreme]] [[constitutional court]], are affiliated with the University of Göttingen: two of them ([[Andreas Paulus]] & Christine Langenfeld) are, currently, professors at the Faculty of Law of the University of Göttingen, while two others (Ines Härtel & Henning Radtke) obtained their PhD in law (Dr.iur) from the University of Göttingen.

However, Göttingen has declined overall in other international rankings in recent years. For example, in the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities|Shanghai Ranking (ARWU)]] of 2018, it was ranked 99th, while in 2004 it was ranked 79th.<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Göttingen Rankings|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings/University-of-Goettingen.html|website=ARWU|accessdate=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021190259/http://www.shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings/University-of-Goettingen.html|archive-date=21 October 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> More surprisingly, according to the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]], Göttingen was previously ranked 43rd in 2011, but was ranked only 123rd in 2019.

=== Partner institutions ===
Within the [[The Göttingen Campus|Göttingen Campus]] the university is organizationally and personally interlinked with the following independent and semi-independent institutions:

* [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry]] ([[Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer Institute]])
* [[Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine]]
* [[Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization]], formerly Max Planck Institute for Flow Research

===Exchange programs===
As Germany is a member of the [[European Union]], university students have the opportunity to participate in the [[Erasmus Programme]]. The university also has exchange programs and partnerships with reputable universities outside Europe such as [[University of Technology, Sydney]] in Australia, [[Tsinghua University]], [[Peking University]] and [[Fudan University]] in China, [[Tokyo University]] in Japan and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/186506.html|title=Georg-August-Universität Göttingen - Exchange opportunities outside Europe|last1=Witzel |first1=Frank |last2=Riechel |first2=Andreas|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706070105/http://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/186506.html|archive-date=6 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Summer school===
[[File:MensaDS3.jpg|thumb|The Alte Mensa]]The university organizes summer courses for international and local students. One of the courses are in [[Data Science]], a two-week summer school. It aims at advanced MA- and beginning PhD students from any discipline who are interested in learning about the many facets of data science.
In a series of lectures, the participants will be introduced to the field of data science from different vantage points. Practical sessions will allow students to apply different theories and methods in practice, both individually and in teams. The Social Program includes different events such as sightseeing tours, hiking trips or a joint barbecue. The summer school 2019 took place at the historic Alte Mensa building.

[[File:Goettingen Marktplatz Oct06 Antilived.jpg|thumb|Gänseliesel fountain and pedestrian zone|left]]
The most famous tradition of the university is that PhD students who have just passed their ''[[Rigorosum]]'' (oral doctoral examination) or dissertation defense sit in a wagon – decorated with flowers and balloons and accompanied by relatives and friends, drive around the inner city and arrive at the Marktplatz – the central square where the old town hall and the [[Gänseliesel]] statue are located. The "newly born doctor" shall climb up to the statue of [[Gänseliesel]] (a poor princess in an old fairy tale who was compelled to keep geese by a wicked woman and later regained her identity), kiss the [[Gänseliesel]] and give bouquets to her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/education/scientists-haven/article4614297.ece|title=Scientists' haven|author=MADHUVANTHI KANNAN|work=The Hindu|accessdate=4 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704132114/http://www.thehindu.com/features/education/scientists-haven/article4614297.ece|archive-date=4 July 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Student life ==
[[File:Hanseatia Göttingen.jpg|left|thumb]]
[[File:Stammbuchblatt Duell GÖ 1816.jpg|left|thumb]]
There is an old saying about life in Göttingen, still inscribed in Latin nowadays on the wall of the entrance to the [[Ratskeller]] (the restaurant located in the basement of the old town hall): {{lang-la|Extra Gottingam non est vita, si est vita, non est ita}} (''There is no life outside Göttingen. Even if it is life, it is no life like here'').

{{quote|"Ancient university towns are wonderfully alike. Göttingen is like [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] in England or [[Yale University|Yale]] in America: very provincial, not on the way to anywhere – no one comes to these backwaters except for the company of professors. And the professors are sure that this is the centre of the world. There is an inscription in the Ratskeller there which reads 'Extra Gottingam non est vita', 'Outside Göttingen there is no life'. This epigram, or should I call it epitaph, is not taken as seriously by the undergraduates as by the professors."|Bronowski, 1973, The Ascent of Man, p.&nbsp;360}}

The university offers eight snack shops and six ''Mensas'' serving lunch at low prices for the students. One ''Mensa'' also provides dinner for students.
