The '''University of Waikato''' ({{lang-mi|Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato}}), informally '''Waikato University''', is a [[comprehensive university]] in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], New Zealand. The university was established in 1964, and has an additional campus located in [[Tauranga]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.waikato.ac.nz/about/history.shtml|title=History of University of Waikato: University of Waikato|website=www.waikato.ac.nz|access-date=11 January 2019}}</ref>

==History==
The University of Waikato began in 1956 after Hamilton locals launched a petition for a university to serve the needs of the South Auckland region. The group was led by Douglas Seymour, a barrister, and subsequently [[Rufus Rogers|Anthony "Rufus" Rogers]], a Hamilton GP and brother to long-time [[Mayor of Hamilton, New Zealand|Mayor of Hamilton]], [[Denis Rogers]].<ref name="DP">Day, Paul. (1984) From The Ground Up: An informal chronicle of the genesis and development of the University of Waikato 1964–1984. University of Waikato, pp. 6, 18,-27, 30, 55, 56, 58–60, 157–9, 172–5, 219.</ref> Their campaign coincided with a shortage of teachers in the 1950s that prompted the New Zealand government to consider plans for a teachers’ college in the region.<ref name="C50">Celebrating 50 years of Teacher Education, 1960–2010, University of Waikato (2010), pp. 2, 3–4</ref> In 1960, the newly established Hamilton Teachers’ College opened its doors, and combined with the fledgling university (then a branch of [[University of Auckland|Auckland University]]), began a joint campus on farmland at [[Hillcrest, Waikato|Hillcrest]], on the city's outskirts.<ref name="DP" />

In 1964, the two institutions moved to their new home, and the following year the University of Waikato was officially opened by then Governor-General Sir [[Bernard Fergusson, Baron Ballantrae|Bernard Fergusson]].<ref name="DP" />

At this time the university comprised a School of Humanities and a School of Social Sciences.<ref name="DP" /> In 1969 a School of Science (now the Faculty of Science and Engineering) was established.<ref>Celebrating 40 years of Science & Engineering, 1969–2009, University of Waikato (2009), p. 1</ref> This was followed by the creation of Waikato Management School in 1972,<ref name="DP" /> Computer Science and Computing Services (which ultimately became the Faculty of Computing and Mathematical Sciences) in 1973,<ref name="DP" /> and the establishment of the School, now Faculty, of Law in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/law/faculty/te_piringa|title=New Name for Faculty|website=Waikato.ac.nz|accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref>

From the beginning, it was envisaged that Māori studies should be a key feature of the new university,<ref name="DP" /> and the Centre for Māori Studies and Research was set up in the School of Social Sciences in 1972.<ref name="DP" /> A separate School of Māori and Pacific Development was formally established in 1996.<ref>University of Waikato Calendar 1996, p. 31</ref> In 1999, the original Schools of Humanities and Social Sciences were merged to form the School (later Faculty) of Arts and Social Sciences.<ref>University of Waikato Calendar 1999, p. 16</ref> In 2010, the tertiary partnership was widened to include Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiārangi in the Eastern Bay of Plenty.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/annualreport/2010/chancellorOverview.shtml|title=Chancellor's Overview|website=Waikato.ac.nz |accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bayofplentytimes.co.nz/news/city-uni-campus-one-step-closer/1250739|title=Tauranga Uni Campus One Step Closer|newspaper=[[Bay of Plenty Times]]|date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref>

In 2014, the university became smoke-free, disallowing smoking on campus and in university-owned vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/official-info/index/docs/smoke-free-policy |title=Smoke Free Policy – Official Information Index : University of Waikato |publisher=Waikato.ac.nz |accessdate=19 June 2015}}</ref>

===Faculty of Law===
The ''Faculty of Law'' was founded in 1990 and is one of seven faculties that make up the University. The Faculty is located on the southeast side of the Hillcrest Campus in Hamilton, accessible from Hillcrest Road. The Law Faculty is also located at the Tauranga campus.

The Law Faculty adopted the principles of professionalism, biculturalism and the study of law in context. One of the key founders of the Waikato Faculty of Law was the 27th [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Margaret Wilson]] who returned<ref name="maragret_wilson_return">{{cite web|url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/law/news/2009/0109_margaretwilson.shtml|title=News + Events – Te Piringa : University of Waikato|website=Waikato.ac.nz|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref> to the faculty as a professor in January 2009.

===Campuses===
The University of Waikato operates from two campuses, Hamilton, and Tauranga. Undergraduate degrees are also offered through a satellite location on the campus of [[Zhejiang University City College]] in [[Hangzhou]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biddle|first1=Donna Lee|title=University of Waikato offers students degree overseas|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/97680695/university-of-waikato-offers-students-degree-overseas|website=Stuff|date=12 October 2017}}</ref>

====Hamilton====
The main Hamilton campus is spread over 64 hectares of landscaped gardens and lakes, and includes extensive sporting and recreational areas. Originally farmland, the campus was designed by architect John Blake-Kelly in 1964. The open space landscaping contains extensive native plantings, including a fernery, centred around three artificial lakes, created by draining marshy paddocks.<ref name="DP" />

====Tauranga====
The University of Waikato previously shared two campuses with [[Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology]] in Tauranga: Windmere and the Bongard Centre. In 2018, it was announced that the University would be moving all of their Tauranga operations to the Bongard Centre, with Toi Ohomai conversely moving their Bongard students to the Windmere campus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Campus changes to benefit tertiary partners|url=https://www.sunlive.co.nz/news/193277-campus-changes-to-benefit-tertiary-partners.html|website=SunLive|date=13 November 2018}}</ref> In April 2019, the Tauranga campus was opened to the public.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Zoe|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/video/news/video.cfm?c_id=1503351&gal_cid=1503351&gallery_id=192752|title=Exclusive: Tauranga's new university campus a year ahead of deadline|website=New Zealand Herald|date=11 May 2018}}</ref>
