The '''''Deseret News''''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Deseret.ogg|ˌ|d|ɛ|z|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|t}})<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng churchofjesuschrist.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «dĕz-a-rĕt´»</ref> is a newspaper published in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]], United States. It is Utah's oldest continuously published daily newspaper and has the largest Sunday circulation in the state and the second largest daily circulation behind ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]].'' The ''News'' is owned by [[Deseret News Publishing Company]], a subsidiary of [[Deseret Management Corporation]], a [[holding company]] owned by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The paper's name is derived from the [[Deseret (Book of Mormon)|word for "honeybee"]] in the [[Book of Mormon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng|title=Ether 2|website=www.churchofjesuschrist.org|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>

The newspaper is printed by the [[Newspaper Agency Corporation]], which it co-owns with ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' under a [[joint operating agreement]]. In 2006, combined circulation of the two papers was 151,422.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0004420.html|title=Top 100 Newspapers in the United States|publisher=[[Infoplease]] (citing [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (North America)|Audit Bureau of Circulation]])}}</ref>

The ''Deseret News'' also publishes a weekly [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|compact]]-sized insert, the ''[[Church News]]'', and the ''[[#Sunday Deseret News national edition|Mormon Times]]'' insert, both of which are included in the newspaper (in the Saturday and Thursday editions, respectively); the two inserts are also distributed as a separate publication outside Utah. The ''Church News'' includes news of the LDS Church and has been published since 1931,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Church News|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History|publisher=Deseret Book|location=Salt Lake City|year=2000|url=http://gospelink.com/next/doc?book_doc_id=350273|access-date=June 6, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> while the ''Mormon Times'' is about "the people, faith and culture associated with the church".<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131021171556/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695246586/Ask-the-editor-Why-Mormon-Times.html "Ask the editor: Why 'Mormon' Times?"], ''Deseret News'', January 24, 2008</ref> Since 1974 the ''Deseret News'' has also published the ''[[Church Almanac]]'', an annual edition carrying LDS Church facts and statistics edited by ''Church News'' staff.

The editorial tone of the ''Deseret News'' is usually described as [[moderate]] to [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], and is often assumed to reflect the values of its owner, the LDS Church. For example, the newspaper does not accept advertising that violates church standards.

==History==
===1850s===
====The press====
[[File:Deseret News - first issue - 15 June 1850.jpg|thumb|Front page of the first issue of the ''Deseret News'', published June 15, 1850]]
On March 31, 1847, while at [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]], [[Nebraska]], the LDS Church's [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] authorized [[W. W. Phelps (Mormon)|William W. Phelps]] to "go east and procure a printing press" to be taken to the future Mormon settlement in the [[Great Basin]].<ref name="ashton 1950">{{cite book|title=Voice in the West: Biography of a Pioneer Newspaper|last=Ashton|first=Wendell J.|publisher=[[Duell, Sloan and Pearce]]|location=New York City|year=1950}}</ref>{{rp|3–4}} Phelps left Winter Quarters sometime in May, and went to [[Boston]] by way of the former Mormon settlement of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]. In Boston, with the help of William I. Appleby, the president of the Church's Eastern States Mission, and Church member Alexander Badlam, Phelps was able to procure a [[wrought iron]] Ramage [[Printing press|hand-press]], [[Movable type|type]], and other required equipment. He returned to Winter Quarters on November 12, 1847, with the press.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|11–12}} Due partly to its size and weight, the press and equipment would not be taken to [[Salt Lake City]] until 1849. By that time many of the [[Mormon pioneers]] had left Winter Quarters and the press was moved across the [[Missouri River]] to another temporary Mormon settlement, [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Kanesville, Iowa]].<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|16}} In April 1849 the press and other church property was loaded onto ox drawn wagons, and traveled with the Howard Egan Company along the [[Mormon Trail]].<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|17}} The wagon company, with the press, arrived in the [[Salt Lake Valley]] August 7, 1849.<ref>{{citation |url= https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/overlandtravel/companies/106 |title=Howard Egan Company 1847–1868 |work=Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel database |publisher=LDS Church }}</ref>

The press was moved into a small [[adobe]] building (just east of the present site of the [[Hotel Utah]]) that also served as a [[Mint (coin)|coin mint]] for the settlers.<ref name="SLC_ensign">{{cite book |last1=Livingstone |first1=John P. |last2=Marsh |first2=W.

====First issue====
The first issue of the ''Deseret News'' was published June 15, 1850, and was 8 pages long. This first issue included the paper's [[Concept note|prospectus]], written by the editor [[Willard Richards]], along with news from the [[United States Congress]], and a report on the [[San Francisco]] 1849 Christmas Eve fire; an event which had occurred six months prior.<ref>{{cite news |title=Birthday News: News Celebrates Sesquicentennial |author=Will Bagley |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=15 June 2000}}</ref> Because it was meant to be the voice of the State of Deseret, it was called the ''Deseret News,'' and its motto was "Truth and Liberty." It was at first a weekly Saturday publication, and published in "pamphlet form" in hopes that readers would have the papers bound into volumes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Prospectus |author=William Richards |url=http://udn.lib.utah.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/deseretnews1/id/324/rec/1 |newspaper=Deseret News |date=15 June 1850 |access-date=January 31, 2013}}</ref> Subscription rate was $2.50 for six months.

A jobs press, usually called the Deseret News Press, was also set up so the ''News'' could print books, booklets, handbills, broadsides, etc., for paying customers and other publishers.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|74}}

====Paper====
From the beginning paper shortages were a problem for the ''News'' staff. Starting with the October 19, 1850 issue—only four months after publication began—the paper had to be changed to a bi-weekly publication.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|53}} Even so, many times in the 1850s there were several periods when the ''News'' could not be published for lack of paper; one period lasted three months during the fall of 1851.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|54–55}}

Thomas Howard, a Mormon immigrant from [[England]], and a paper-maker, approached [[Brigham Young]] about using some machinery—originally meant for producing sugar—to make their own paper; Young agreed to the plan. The publishers asked everyone to donate old paper and cloth to the venture. In the summer of 1854 the first issues of the ''News'' were published on "homemade paper" that was very thick, and grayish in color.<<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|56–57}}

Even with paper shortages, occasionally a ''News'' extra would be published, if there were important news or a sermon that could not wait for the regular publication date.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|73}}

====Utah War====

During a turbulent time period, later known as the [[Utah War]], the ''News'' presses and equipment were moved to the central and southern parts of the state. As armed forces of the [[United States]] camped just outside the state at [[Fort Bridger]], [[George Q. Cannon]] was assigned to take some presses and equipment to [[Fillmore, Utah|Fillmore]] while Henry McEwan was to take the remainder to [[Parowan, Utah|Parowan]]. On May 5, 1858 the first issue of the ''News'' with Fillmore City as the publication place appeared; issues would continue to be printed in both Fillmore and Parowan until September 1858<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|89–90}} While in Fillmore, the press was kept in the basement of the [[Utah Territorial Statehouse]]. That fall the presses were brought back to Salt Lake City and placed in the [[Council House (Salt Lake City)|Council House]], allowing the ''News'' to begin normal operations. The soldiers who had marched to Utah during the war would remain at the newly constructed [[Camp Floyd]]. Their need for a newspaper, one not published by the LDS Church, was satisfied with ''Kirk Anderson's Valley Tan'', the area's second newspaper (and first competitor to the ''News''); published November 6, 1858.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|98}}

During the 1850s through 1860s, numerous articles in the ''News'' were printed in the [[Deseret Alphabet]].<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|75}}

===1860–1900===
The coming of the [[Pony Express]] to Utah in 1860 would bring changes to the paper, allowing news from the East to arrive to the Territory much faster. Even so, the paper remained a weekly, with ''News'' extras being published with more frequency and temporary renamed ''The Pony Dispatch''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wharton |first1=Gayen |last2=Wharton |first2=Tom |title=It Happened in Utah |year=1998 |publisher=TwoDot |isbn=1560446498 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ithappenedinutah00whar/page/33 33] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ithappenedinutah00whar/page/33 }}</ref>

Yet, paper problems still plagued the publishers; paper was very expensive to haul from [[California]] or the East, and attempts at making paper in the valley were still, for the most part, futile. In 1860 a paper-making machine had been purchased, and set-up in the [[Deseret Manufacturing Company]] sugar house factory, but lack of available materials meant a lack of paper. As a result, Brigham Young called George Goddard on a rag-gathering mission. Goddard traveled through the territory collecting rags that would then be turned into paper, and was able to supply enough to keep the ''News'' in production.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|124–125}} Other problems such as ice and drought on the stream, running out of [[Parley's Canyon]], that ran the paper mill caused the paper to have short lapses in publication.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|125}}

In October 1861 the lines of the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph]] met in Salt Lake City, making the Pony Express obsolete, and bringing news to the Territory almost instantly. The ''News'' extras, now sometimes called telegraphic dispatches, were printed with even more frequency.

[[File:Deseret Store - with Tithing Office and Deseret News addition.jpg|thumb|left|The Deseret Store, home of the ''Deseret News'' from 1851-1854 and 1862-1903]]
In March 1862 the ''News'' and its staff moved from the Council House to the Deseret Store,<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|125}} and in 1864 a steam-powered printing press arrived; it was placed in the basement the building.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|126}} The set type was lowered from the offices in the building's upper floor to the basement, through holes in the each floor. Later an addition was constructed to the east of this building, and the presses were moved into that building.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|181}}

On October 8, 1865 the ''News'' launched its semi-weekly edition, this allowed news to get out more quickly and allowed for more advertisements. The weekly edition would continue and contained much of the same content as the semi-weekly, but editorials were different.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|141}}

In November 1867 [[George Q. Cannon]] became the editor, and on the 21st of that month, the ''News'' published its first daily edition, which was published in the evening, and as such was named ''The Deseret Evening News''.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|146}} Most of what was published in the daily edition, was also published in the weekly and semi-weekly, as the daily was meant for city readers and the weekly and semi-weekly for those living in the more rural areas of the territory.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|150}} Until December 1898 all three editions—the weekly, semi-weekly, and daily—were published concurrently.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|171}}

In 1870 the ''Mormon Tribune'', later named ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', was first printed, adding a new newspaper rival to the Salt Lake area. Since its founding the ''Tribune'' and ''News'' have often been involved in "newspaper battles," times when they could not agree on anything, even secular items. During these battles the ''News'' has often been called grandmother, granny, or The Mormon Hand Organ.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|196}}

Since its first publication the ''News'' had been owned directly by the LDS Church, but as worries about property confiscation increased due to the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]] and [[Poland Act]], and the paper's ownership was transferred to The Deseret News Company after it was incorporated on September 3, 1880.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|183}} About this same time the ''News'' began looking for a location to build a new paper mill, as the Sugar House paper plant was not adequate. A new [[granite]] plant was constructed near the mouth of [[Big Cottonwood Canyon]], 13 miles south of the paper's offices. The mill began producing paper in April 1883, and was known as the [[Cottonwood Paper Mill]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Deseret News Comp nay's Paper Mill |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ap8EAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8TADAAAAIBAJ&pg=4484%2C3808362 |newspaper=The Deseret Evening News |date=October 4, 1884 |access-date=January 25, 2013}}</ref> The ''News'' would sell the paper mill in 1892 to the Granite Paper Mills Company.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|199–200}} The mill caught fire and was destroyed April 1, 1893.

====Changing ownership====
On October 1, 1892, The Deseret News Company leased the ''News'' along with all the company's printing, bookbinding, and merchandising to the [[Cannon family]]. The family was, at that time, operating the George Q. Cannon & Sons bookstore in downtown Salt Lake City. When the lease began the family formed the Deseret News Printing Company, which was to be the lessee, while The Deseret News Company would remain a legal entity as the lessor. Two children of former ''News'' editor George Q. Cannon would play prominent roles during this period, with [[John Q. Cannon]] as editor and [[Abraham H. Cannon]] as business manager.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|207–208}} The leasing had occurred due to financial troubles, and the Cannon family hoped to make the business profitable. This did not happen and the paper's assets and property were transferred back to The Deseret News Company on September 7, 1898; after almost six years under the control of the Cannon family. The family's Deseret News Publishing Company was dissolved after the lease was gone, and within a few months The Deseret News Company was also dissolved and ownership of the paper was returned directly to the LDS Church.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|225–226}}

When the Church regained direct control over the ''News'', Horace G. Whitney was appointed business manager and Charles W. Penrose returned as editor. Immediately the paper's weekly edition, ''The Deseret Weekly'', was discontinued; its last issue was published December 10, 1898.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|230–231}}

===1900–1920s===
[[File:Deseret News and Union Pacific Building - March 1911.jpg|thumb|left|The Deseret News and Union Pacific Building, home of the ''News'' from 1903 to 1926]]
On October 1, 1900 the George Q. Cannon & Sons bookstore was sold to the LDS Church, and renamed the Deseret News Bookstore. In 1920 the Deseret Sunday School Union Bookstore was also consolidated into the Deseret News Bookstore, and eventually the bookstore would become its own company, [[Deseret Book]].

In 1903 the ''News'' moved out from its longtime home in the Deseret Store, kitty-corner to a newly constructed building. This was the first time the paper had a building constructed expressly for it. It was designed by [[Richard K.A. Kletting]] and built with stone from [[Mount Nebo (Utah)|Mount Nebo]] in Central Utah. While the building was under-construction a fire destroyed the [[Oregon Short Line Railroad|Oregon Short Line]] building in Salt Lake City, and the railroad wanted to rent space in the new building. As a result, the ''News'' constructed an annex to the west of the new building for more space.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|243–244}} This new home was at the site of the former [[Council House (Salt Lake City)|Council House]]; presently the Beneficial Tower (Gateway Tower West) sits at this location.

The daily, called the ''Deseret Evening News'' was renamed the ''Deseret News'' on June 15, 1920; the paper's 70th anniversary. The semi-weekly was discontinued on June 22, 1922, leaving the daily as the only news publication. Two days later the ''News'' announced it had purchased the ''Utah Farmer'', a weekly agricultural paper; which it would eventually sell.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|283–284}}

In 1926 the ''News'' once again moved into a new building, this time on Richard's Street (just south of the present Deseret Book store in [[City Creek Center]].) This same year the ''News'' began using [[Teleprinter|teletype]] technology to receive news from the [[Associated Press]].<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|288–289}}

During the 1920s the paper's circulation nearly doubled, reaching almost 40,000.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|291}}

====Radio====
On November 20, 1920, the ''News'' began airing nightly wireless news flashes, called the ''Deseret News''-International News Service bulletins. The paper had also formed The Deseret News Wireless Club, with members across the [[Western United States]] who would transcribe the radio bulletins and post them in their communities.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|269}} In April 1922 the paper received a license to officially operate a radio station, with call letters KZN (later changed to [[KSL (radio)|KSL]]). The station's first regular broadcast aired on May 6, 1922 in the form of a talk by then-LDS Church president [[Heber J. Grant]].<ref>{{cite news |work=The Deseret Morning News |title=KSL wins another Crystal Award |first=Lynn |last=Arave |url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,635204861,00.html |date=May 4, 2006}}</ref> In 1924 the station was sold to John Cope and his father, F.W. Cope, who formed the Radio Service Corporation of Utah. The LDS Church would later purchase this corporation and go on to create [[KSL-TV]].<ref>{{cite news |title=KSL Radio: On-air highlights |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/911443/KSL-Radio-On-air-highlights.html|newspaper=Deseret News|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=May 3, 2002 |access-date=January 26, 2013}}</ref> The ''News'', KSL Radio, and KSL Television continue to remain closely linked.

===1930–1950s===

====The Deseret News Publishing Company====
The ''News'' had been under the direct ownership of the Church since 1898, when The Deseret News Company was dissolved. On December 29, 1931, the [[Deseret News Publishing Company]] was incorporated (not to be confused with the Deseret News Publishing Company formed in 1892 by the Cannon family to lease ownership of the paper, and dissolved when the lease was over). Its articles of incorporation, filed with the [[Salt Lake County]] Clerk, provided for 500 shares of stock, all retained by the Church (with the exception of the qualifying directors' shares).<ref>{{cite news |title=Deseret News Files Articles |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OWEzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VUcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6896%2C6039398 |newspaper=The Deseret News |date=December 29, 1931 |access-date=January 26, 2013}}</ref>

====First Sunday edition====
On May 16, 1948 the ''News'' would deliver its first Sunday paper. The first Sunday edition contained 154 pages with a new farm, home, and garden section.<ref name="ashton 1950"/>{{rp|339}} The Sunday edition would continue into the 1950s, when an agreement with ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' would end it.

====1952: Newspaper Agency Corporation====
After World War II the ''Deseret News'', ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Salt Lake Telegram]]'' were all struggling financially, but no more than the ''Deseret News''. In September 1952, the owners of the ''News'' (LDS Church) and ''Tribune'' ([[Thomas Kearns]] Family) entered into a [[joint operating agreement]] (JOA), where each published separate editorial material while sharing printing, advertising and circulation costs. This JOA was the brainchild of ''Tribune'' Publisher [[John F. Fitzpatrick]] who helped LDS President [[David O. McKay]] ensure the continuation of the ''Deseret News''. As its architect, Fitzpatrick knew that this NAC arrangement would also benefit the ''Tribune''. The ''News'' stopped Sunday publication; subscribers received a Sunday ''Tribune'' instead. The ''Deseret News'' also purchased the afternoon ''Salt Lake Telegram'' from the ''Tribune''. The ''Telegram'' was discontinued, and into the mid-1960s, the paper's nameplate read: ''The Deseret News and Salt Lake Telegram''. The 30-year agreement between the two papers was renewed in 1982, with some changes. The Newspaper Agency Corporation was renamed to MediaOne of Utah in 2007.

===1960–1990===
''Deseret News'' reporter Robert Mullins won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1962 for local reporting "for his resourceful coverage of a murder and kidnapping at [[Dead Horse Point State Park]]".

In 1968 the ''News'' once again moved, this time into a new building on Regent Street.

====Sunday morning edition====
The joint operating agreement with the ''Tribune'' in 1952 had ended the paper's Sunday edition, but when the 30-year-old agreement was up for renewal, it was changed to allow the ''News'' to publish a Sunday morning edition and change its Saturday publication from an evening to morning paper.<ref>{{cite news |title=Deseret News to start Sunday edition in 1983|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HUAjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=W4MDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4105%2C4747607 |newspaper=Deseret News |date=May 19, 1982 |access-date=January 31, 2013}}</ref> The first Sunday morning edition of the ''News'' appeared January 16, 1983, and the paper has published a Sunday edition ever since.

===1990s===
[[File:Slc deseret news building.jpg|thumb|The former location of the ''Deseret News'' on Regent Street. The newspaper's logotype was carved into the top of the building's façade (since filled in by its new tenant) to give the building the appearance of the newspaper.]]
The newspaper moved into its newly constructed headquarters in on Regent Street [[downtown Salt Lake City]] in 1997.

As the twentieth century ended, the ''Deseret News'' found itself embroiled in a contentious and often public battle with ''The Salt Lake Tribune'',  centered around the terms of their joint operating agreement, the desire of the ''Deseret News'' to switch from afternoon to morning publication, and ownership changes at the ''Tribune''. The battle was resolved with the 2000 sale of the ''Tribune''<ref>The Tribune was acquired by Dean Singleton (via his ''MediaNews Group'') in 2000; see [http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history/Lo-Me/MediaNews-Group-Inc.html]</ref> and with the ''News'' switching to morning publication and changing its name on June 9, 2003 to the ''Deseret Morning News''.

====Internet presence====
On January 26, 1995 the ''News'' launched the Crossroads Information Network, allowing subscribers to access the ''News'' digitally through their dial-up service; digital-only subscriptions were also created. Installation of the Crossroads software—which was mailed on [[floppy disk]] to each subscriber beginning in February 1995—was required on each user's computer. The network also allowed users to access the paper's complete text along with archives back to April 1988, the ''Church News'' and the LDS Church Almanac.

==="Faith" section's features===
Included in the website's sections are stories of the LDS Church's [[general authorities]] and news emanating from the [[Church Office Building]].

''Mormon Times'' brings the stories, photos, and updates of the more than 50,000 [[LDS missionaries]] all together in one place.

The education section contains current-event items drawn from across the [[Church Educational System]] (CES), including its [[Seminary#LDS Youth seminaries|seminary program]], [[Fireside (LDS Church)|regular firesides]], and the units of CES higher education, such as [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU).

As [[genealogy]] research is one of the hallmarks of [[Mormon]] culture, ''Mormon Times'' shares news and information relevant to [[family history]] enthusiasts.

''Mormon Times'' works with the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] to provide its readers with answers on a wide variety of topics in a Q&A section.

''Mormon Times'' provides an entry point to a full, searchable edition of the [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]], courtesy of [[Brigham Young University|BYU's]] [[Harold B. Lee Library]].

The paper also has a broader faith section that covers stories that have no relation to Mormonism, and just broadly touch on religious topics or specifically mention religions other than Mormonism.<ref>[http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/04/religious-but-not-mormon-the-church-owned-deseret-news-considers-you-a-growth-market/ Nieman Lab article on the Deseret News Faith section]</ref>

====2010 restructuring====
Summer 2010 saw multiple changes both in leadership and structure at the ''Deseret News''. A new Opinion Editor, [[Paul S. Edwards (journalist)|Paul S. Edwards]], was appointed. Edwards had previously been provost at [[Southern Virginia University]] and earlier a political science professor at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU). Editor Joe Cannon and publisher Jim Wall stepped down.

During the summer of 2010 it was announced that the ''Deseret News'' for the first time ever would have a president and CEO; [[Clark Gilbert]] was appointed to this position. He was already CEO of [[Deseret Digital Media]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700060501/Deseret-News-announces-new-media-leadership-team.html |title=Deseret News announces new media leadership team|work=Deseret News|first=Lynn|last=Arave|date=August 26, 2010 |access-date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

Gilbert announced the future of ''Deseret News'' was leaner, and more online. In August 2010 he announced the layoffs of 85 staffers, 57 full-time and 28 part-time.
