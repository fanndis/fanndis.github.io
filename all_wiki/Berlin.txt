==History==
{{Main|History of Berlin}}
{{Further|Timeline of Berlin}}

===Etymology===
Berlin lies in northeastern Germany, east of the River [[Elbe]], that once constituted, together with the River (Saxon or Thuringian) [[Saale]] (from their [[confluence]] at [[Barby, Germany|Barby]] onwards), the eastern border of the [[Francia|Frankish Realm]]. While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' ("swamp").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}</ref> Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''Bär'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore a [[canting arms|canting arm]].

Of Berlin's [[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|twelve boroughs]], five bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: [[Pankow]] (the most populous), [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Marzahn-Hellersdorf]], [[Treptow-Köpenick]] and [[Spandau]] (named Spandow until 1878). Of its ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: [[Altglienicke]], [[Alt-Treptow]], [[Britz]], [[Buch (Berlin)|Buch]], [[Buckow (Berlin)|Buckow]], [[Gatow]], [[Karow (Berlin)|Karow]], [[Kladow]], [[Köpenick]], [[Lankwitz]], [[Lübars]], [[Malchow (Berlin)|Malchow]], [[Marzahn]], [[Pankow (locality)|Pankow]], [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Rudow]], [[Schmöckwitz]], [[Spandau (locality)|Spandau]], [[Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow]], [[Steglitz]], [[Tegel]] and [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]]. The neighborhood of [[Moabit]] bears a [[French language|French]]-derived name, and [[Französisch Buchholz]] is named after the [[Huguenots]].

In 1443, [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II Irontooth]] started the construction of a new [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|royal palace]] in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the "Berlin Indignation" ("Berliner Unwille").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diegeschichteberlins.de/geschichteberlins/berlinabc/stichworteag/555-berliner-unwillen.html |title=Berliner Unwillen |trans-title=Berlin unwillingness |publisher=Verein für die Geschichte Berlins e.&nbsp;V. |first=Gerhild H.

[[File:Berlin Unter den Linden Victoria Hotel um 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin became the capital of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years.]]

Since 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in [[personal union]] with the [[Duchy of Prussia]]. In 1701, the dual state formed the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], as [[Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg]], crowned himself as king [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I in Prussia]]. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom,<ref>Horlemann, Bernd (Hrsg.), Mende, Hans-Jürgen (Hrsg.): Berlin 1994. Taschenkalender.

This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, "Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin".<ref name="Stöver2010"/>

The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic centre of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin.

At the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918, a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] was proclaimed by [[Philipp Scheidemann]] at the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]]. In 1920, the [[Greater Berlin Act]] incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from {{cvt|66|to|883|km2}}. The population almost doubled and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the [[Weimar culture|Weimar era]], Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties, but also became a renowned centre of the [[Roaring Twenties]]. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government and industries. [[Albert Einstein]] rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1921.

NSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 as a result of emigration between 1933 and 1939. After [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. Starting in early 1943, many were shipped to [[death camp]]s, such as [[Auschwitz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005450|title=The Jewish Community of Berlin|publisher=Holocuast Encyclopedia |accessdate=10 November 2018}}</ref> Berlin is the most heavily bombed city in history.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed during {{Dash year|1943|1945}} Allied air raids and the 1945 [[Battle of Berlin]].

The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] (the United States, the United Kingdom and France) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/geschichte/nationalsozialismus/dossier-nationalsozialismus/39619/das-geteilte-berlin?p=all |title=Berlin – auf dem Weg zur geteilten Stadt |trans-title=Berlin – on the way to a divided city |date=27 April 2005 |first=Prof. Dr. Wolfgang |last=Benz |language=de |publisher=Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung |accessdate=10 November 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Wall]] (painted on the western side) was a barrier that divided the city from 1961 to 1989.]]

All four [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the [[Soviet Union]] imposed a [[Berlin Blockade|blockade]] on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The [[Berlin airlift]], conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|publisher=Western Allies Berlin|accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref> In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in [[West Germany]] and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East Berlin included most of the city's historic centre. The West German government established itself in [[Bonn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html |title=Berlin after 1945 |publisher=BerlinOnline Stadtportal GmbH & Co. KG. |access-date=8 April 2009}}</ref> In 1961, East Germany began to build the [[Berlin Wall]] around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]]. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. [[John F. Kennedy]] gave his "''[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]''" speech in 1963, underlining the US support for the Western part of the city. Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm |title=Ostpolitik: The Quadripartite Agreement of September 3, 1971 |publisher=U.S. Diplomatic Mission to Germany |year=1996 |accessdate=18 August 2008}}</ref>

In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|Berlin Wall fell]] on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the [[East Side Gallery]] preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin again became a reunified city. [[Walter Momper]], the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim. City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first "all Berlin" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and [[Eberhard Diepgen]] (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/01/world/berlin-mayoral-contest-has-many-uncertainties.html |title=Berlin Mayoral Contest Has Many Uncertainties |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1 December 1990}}</ref> On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a [[German reunification#Reunified Berlin|reunified Berlin]]<ref name=ReUnificationParade>{{cite news | last=Kinzer | first=Stephan | title=Allied Soldiers March to Say Farewell to Berlin | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/19/world/allied-soldiers-march-to-say-farewell-to-berlin.html | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | location=New York City | date=19 June 1994 | accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994).

Berlin is in northeastern [[Germany]], in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat [[topography]], part of the vast [[Northern European Plain]] which stretches all the way from northern [[France]] to western [[Russia]]. The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&spn=0.060339,0.085316&t=k|title=Satellite Image Berlin|publisher=Google Maps|access-date=18 August 2008}}</ref>

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow Plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at {{convert|122|m|abbr=off}} elevation, have been the highest point in Berlin. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed [[Teufelsberg]] ({{cvt|120.1|m|disp=or}}), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qiez.de/pankow/wohnen-und-leben/gruenes-berlin/der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-liegt-nun-in-pankow-arkenberge/169588800 |title=Berlin hat eine neue Spitze |trans-title=Berlin has a new top |first=Nikolaus |last=Triantafillou |accessdate=11 November 2018 |language=de |publisher=Qiez |date=27 January 2015}}</ref> The [[Müggelberge]] at {{convert|114.7|m|abbr=off}} elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at {{convert|28.1|m|abbr=off}} elevation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/pankow/das-ist-die-hoehe-arkenberge-der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-ist-neuerdings-in-pankow/11406254.html |title=Der höchste Berg von Berlin ist neuerdings in Pankow |trans-title=The tallest mountain in Berlin is now in Pankow |date=22 February 2015 |accessdate=22 February 2015 |work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |first=Stefan |last=Jacobs |language=de}}</ref>

Due to its transitional climate zones, frosts are common in winter and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many [[oceanic climate]]s. Furthermore, Berlin is classified as a [[Temperate climate|temperate]] [[Humid continental climate|continental climate]] (''Dc'') under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha climate scheme]], as well as the suburbs of [[New York City]], although the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]] puts them in different types.<ref>Gerstengarbe FW, Werner PC (2009) A short update on Koeppen climate shifts in Europe between 1901 and 2003.

===Cityscape===
[[File:Berlin - Aerial view - 2016.jpg|thumb|View over central and northeastern Berlin]]

Berlin's history has left the city with a [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric]] organization and a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history during the 20th century. All of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, as well as the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.

Berlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|air raids]], fires and street battles during the Second World War, and many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West, were demolished during the post-war period. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new business or residential districts and the main arteries. Much [[Ornament (art)|ornamentation]] on pre-war buildings was destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], and in both post-war systems, as well as in the reunified Berlin, many important heritage structures have been [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' along with, the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the monumental buildings on [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and also the project to reconstruct the baroque façades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings have been inspired by their historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].

Clusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|towers]] rise at various locations: [[Potsdamer Platz]], the [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two delineating the former centers of East and West Berlin, with the first representing a new Berlin of the 21st century, risen from the wastes of no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.

[[File:Berliner Dom seen from James Simon Park.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Cathedral]] at [[Museum Island]]]]
The [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{cvt|368|m}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.

The [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

[[File:Bikinihaus Berlin-1210760.jpg|thumb|[[Breitscheidplatz]] with [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] is the centre of [[City West]].]]
[[Unter den Linden]] is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of [[Humboldt University]] is there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Golden Twenties]]. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

[[Potsdamer Platz]] is an entire quarter built from scratch after the [[Berlin Wall|Wall]] came down.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html |title=Construction and redevelopment since 1990 |publisher=Senate Department of Urban Development |access-date=18 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610103008/http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html |archive-date=10 June 2008}}</ref> To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]], and is flanked by the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Berliner Philharmonie]].

The area around [[Hackescher Markt]] is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the [[Hackesche Höfe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east–west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous "[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].

West of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.

The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{cvt|55|m}} and an observation deck {{cvt|126|m}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

The [[Oberbaumbrücke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, after the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9&nbsp;million to 4&nbsp;million.

Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin is home to at least 180,000 [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Turks in Germany|Turkish German]] residents,<ref name="pop-detail"/> making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. In the 1990s the ''Aussiedlergesetze'' enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former [[Soviet Union]].

===Languages===
{{Main|German language|Berlinerisch dialect}}
[[German language|German]] is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm |title=Official Languages |author=European Commission |accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> and one of the three [[working language]]s of the [[European Commission]].

Berlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically, but has features of [[Lausitzisch-neumärkisch dialects]]. It is spoken in Berlin and the [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|surrounding metropolitan area]]. It originates from a [[Mark Brandenburgish dialects|Mark Brandenburgish]] variant. The dialect is now seen more as a [[sociolect]], largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak [[standard German]] in everyday life.

The most-commonly-spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Polish, English, Arabic, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, French, Spanish and Vietnamese. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish and Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part, due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. Polish, English, Russian, and Vietnamese have more native speakers in East Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/wirtschaft/article1309952/Zwei-Millionen-Berliner-sprechen-mindestens-zwei-Sprachen.html |title=Studie – Zwei Millionen Berliner sprechen mindestens zwei Sprachen – Wirtschaft – Berliner Morgenpost – Berlin |publisher=Morgenpost.de |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref>

According to the 2011 census, approximately 37 percent of the population reported being members of a legally-recognized church or religious organization. The rest either did not belong to such an organization, or there was no information available about them.<ref name="Census 2011">{{cite web|title=Zensus 2011 – Bevölkerung und Haushalte – Bundesland Berlin|url=https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/zensus/gdb/bev/be/11_Berlin_bev.pdf|website=[[Amt für Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg]]|pages=6–7|accessdate=23 February 2019|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193809/https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/zensus/gdb/bev/be/11_Berlin_bev.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin}}
[[File:Berlin Subdivisions.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|[[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|Berlin's 12 boroughs and their 96 neighborhoods]] ]]

Berlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts (''Bezirke''). Each borough has a number of subdistricts or neighborhoods (''Ortsteile''), which have roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighbourhoods, colloquially called ''[[Kiez]]''. At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.

Each borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin.<!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --> The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies.

===Twin towns – sister cities===
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}

Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.<ref name=Berlinsistercities>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/en/international-relations/city-partnerships/ |title=City Partnerships |type=official web site |publisher=Governing Mayor of Berlin, Senate Chancellery, Directorate for Protocol and International Relations |website=Berlin.de |accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref> [[Twin towns and sister cities|Town twinning]] between Berlin and other cities began with its sister city Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification but later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the Western World, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.

There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Beirut]], [[Belgrade]], [[São Paulo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Mumbai]], [[Oslo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], [[New York City]] and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, and Conference of the World's Capital Cities.

Public transportation in Berlin has a long and complicated history because of the 20<sup>th</sup> century division of the city, where movement between the two halves was not served. Since [[1989]], the transport network has been developed extensively; however, it still contains early 20<sup>th</sup> century traits, such as the U1.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wolf, Winfried.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33163088|title=Berlin, Weltstadt ohne Auto? : Verkehrsgeschichte 1848-2015|date=1994|publisher=ISP|isbn=3-929008-74-2|edition=1.

{{Main|Rohrpost in Berlin}}
From 1865 until 1976 Berlin had an extensive [[Pneumatic tube|pneumatic postal network]], which at its peak in 1940, totalled 400 kilometres length. After 1949 the system was split in two separated networks. The West Berlin system in operation and open for public use until 1963, and for government use until 1972. The East Berlin system which inherited the ''Hauptelegraphenamt'', the central hub of the system, was in operation until 1976

===Energy===
[[File:Berlin-mitte heizkraftwerk-mitte 20060605 629.jpg|thumb|Heizkraftwerk Mitte power plant]]

Berlin's two largest energy provider for private households are the Swedish firm [[Vattenfall]] and the Berlin-based company [[GASAG]]. Both offer electric power and natural gas supply. Some of the city's electric energy is imported from nearby power plants in southern [[Brandenburg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/berlin.pdf|title=European Green City Index Berlin Germany|website=Siemens|year=2009|accessdate=19 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913113150/https://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/berlin.pdf|archive-date=13 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{As of|2015}} the five [[List of power stations in Germany|largest power plants measured by capacity]] are the Heizkraftwerk Reuter West, the Heizkraftwerk Lichterfelde, the Heizkraftwerk Mitte, the Heizkraftwerk Wilmersdorf, and the Heizkraftwerk Charlottenburg. All of these [[power station]]s generate [[electricity generation|electricity]] and [[Heat|useful heat]] at the same time to facilitate buffering during load peaks.

In 1993 the power grid connections in the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region were renewed. In most of the inner districts of Berlin power lines are underground cables; only a 380&nbsp;kV and a 110&nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] is the backbone of the city's energy grid.

Berlin is home to 44 theaters and stages.<ref name="factsheet"/> The [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]] in Mitte was built in 1849–50 and has operated almost continuously since then. The [[Volksbühne]] at [[Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz]] was built in 1913–14, though the company had been founded in 1890. The [[Berliner Ensemble]], famous for performing the works of [[Bertolt Brecht]], was established in 1949. The [[Schaubühne]] was founded in 1962 and moved to the building of the former Universum Cinema on Kurfürstendamm in 1981. With a seating capacity of 1,895 and a stage floor of {{convert|2854|m2|0|abbr=off}}, the [[Friedrichstadt-Palast]] in Berlin Mitte is the largest show palace in Europe.

Berlin has three major [[opera house]]s: the [[Deutsche Oper]], the [[Berlin State Opera]], and the [[Komische Oper]].

The Komische Oper has traditionally specialized in [[operetta]]s and is also at Unter den Linden. The Deutsche Oper opened in 1912 in Charlottenburg.

The city's main venue for musical theater performances are the Theater am Potsdamer Platz and [[Theater des Westens]] (built in 1895). Contemporary dance can be seen at the ''Radialsystem V''. The [[Tempodrom]] is host to concerts and circus inspired entertainment. It also houses a multi-sensory spa experience.
