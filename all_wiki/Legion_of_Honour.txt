<!-- Note: Please apply British "honour", as used on its website -->

The '''Legion of Honour'''{{efn|The full official name is '''National Order of the Legion of Honour''' ({{lang-fr|Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur}}), formerly the '''Royal Order of the Legion of Honour''' (''{{lang|fr|Ordre royal de la Légion d'honneur}}'').}} ({{lang-fr|Légion d'honneur}}, {{IPA-fr|leʒjɔ̃ dɔnœʁ|IPA}}) is the highest French [[order of merit]] for [[military]] and civil merits, established in 1802 by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] and retained by all later French governments and régimes. 

The order's [[motto]] is ''{{lang|fr|Honneur et Patrie}}'' ("Honour and Fatherland"), and its [[seat (legal entity)|seat]] is the [[Palais de la Légion d'Honneur]] next to the [[Musée d'Orsay]], on the left bank of the [[Seine]] in [[Paris]].{{efn|The award for the French Legion of Honour is known by many titles, also depending on the five levels of degree: Knight of the Legion of Honour; ''{{lang|fr|Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur}}''; Officer of the Legion of Honour; ''{{lang|fr|Officier de la Légion d'honneur}}''; Commander of the Legion of Honour; ''{{lang|fr|Commandeur de la Légion d'honneur}}''; Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour; ''{{lang|fr|Grand officier de la Légion d'honneur}}''; Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour; ''{{lang|fr|Grand'Croix de la Légion d'honneur}}''. The word ''{{lang|fr|honneur}}'' is often capitalised, as in the name of the palace ''{{lang|fr|[[Palais de la Légion d'Honneur]]}}''.}}

The order is divided into five degrees of increasing distinction: ''{{lang|fr|Chevalier}}'' ([[Knight]]), ''{{lang|fr|Officier}}'' (Officer), ''{{lang|fr|Commandeur}}'' ([[Commander (order)|Commander]]), ''{{lang|fr|Grand officier}}'' (Grand Officer), and ''{{lang|fr|Grand-croix}}'' ([[Grand Cross]]).

==History==
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}<!--only one citation in entire section-->

===Consulat===
During the [[French Revolution]], all of the French [[Order of chivalry|orders of chivalry]] were abolished and replaced with [[Weapons of Honour]]. It was the wish of [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], the [[French Consulate|First Consul]], to create a reward to commend civilians and soldiers. From this wish was instituted a {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}},<ref>Pierre-Louis Roederer, "Speech Proposing the Creation of a Legion of Honour", ''Napoleon: Symbol for an Age, A Brief History with Documents'', ed. Rafe Blaufarb (New York: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2008), 101–102.</ref> a body of men that was not an order of [[chivalry]], for Napoleon believed that France wanted a [[order of merit|recognition of merit]] rather than a new system of nobility. However, the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} did use the organization of the old French orders of chivalry, for example, the {{lang|fr|[[Order of Saint Louis|Ordre de Saint-Louis]]}}. The insignia of the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} bear a resemblance to those of the {{lang|fr|Ordre de Saint-Louis}}, which also used a red ribbon.

Napoleon originally created this award to ensure political loyalty. The organization would be used as a façade to give political favours, gifts, and concessions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43294-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeillustr00jone_0/page/196 196]|edition=1st|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeillustr00jone_0|date=20 October 1994}}</ref> The {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} was loosely patterned after a [[Roman legion]], with [[legionary|legionaries]], [[officer (armed forces)|officers]], commanders, regional "[[cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s" and a grand council. The highest rank was not a Grand Cross but a {{lang|fr|Grand aigle}} (Grand Eagle), a rank that wore the insignia common to a Grand Cross. The members were paid, the highest of them extremely generously:
* 5,000 [[franc]]s to a {{lang|fr|grand officier}},
* 2,000 francs to a {{lang|fr|commandeur}},
* 1,000 francs to an {{lang|fr|officier}},
* 250 francs to a {{lang|fr|légionnaire}}.

Napoleon famously declared, "You call these baubles, well, it is with baubles that men are led... Do you think that you would be able to make men fight by reasoning? Never. That is good only for the scholar in his study. The soldier needs glory, distinctions, rewards."<ref>{{cite book |author=Antoine Claire Thibaudeau |title=Mémoires sur le Consulat. 1799 à 1804 |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Rfl9mwoQBzkC |trans-title=Memories of the Consulate, 1799–1804 |year=1827 |publisher=Chez Ponthieu et Cie |location=Paris |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Rfl9mwoQBzkC/page/n94 83]–84 |language=fr |author-link=Antoine Claire Thibaudeau }}</ref> This has been often quoted as "It is with such baubles that men are led."

The order was the first modern [[order of merit]]. Under the monarchy, such orders were often limited to Roman Catholics, and all knights had to be noblemen. The military decorations were the perks of the officers. The {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}}, however, was open to men of all ranks and professions—only merit or bravery counted. The new legionnaire had to be sworn into the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}}.
All previous orders were Christian, or shared a clear Christian background, whereas the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} is a secular institution. The badge of the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} has five arms.

===First Empire===
<!--this section linked from image caption above-->
In a decree issued on the {{lang|fr|10 [[Pluviôse]] [[French Republican Calendar|XIII]]}} (30 January 1805), a grand decoration was instituted. This decoration, a cross on a large [[sash]] and a silver star with an eagle, symbol of the Napoleonic Empire, became known as the {{lang|fr|Grand aigle}} (Grand Eagle), and later in 1814 as the {{lang|fr|Grand cordon}} (big sash, literally "big ribbon"). After Napoleon crowned himself [[Emperor of the French]] in 1804 and established the [[Nobility of the First French Empire|Napoleonic nobility]] in 1808, award of the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} gave right to the title of "Knight of the Empire" ({{lang|fr|Chevalier de l'Empire}}). The title was made hereditary after three generations of grantees.

Napoleon had dispensed 15 golden collars of the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} among his family and his senior ministers. This collar was abolished in 1815.

Although research is made difficult by the loss of the archives, it is known that three women who fought with the army were decorated with the order: [[Virginie Ghesquière]], [[Marie Schellinck| Marie-Jeanne Schelling]] and a [[nun]], Sister [[:fr: Anne Biget|Anne Biget]].{{efn|The first recorded women's award is 1851, under [[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte]].}}

The {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} was prominent and visible in the French Empire. The Emperor always wore it, and the fashion of the time allowed for decorations to be worn most of the time. The king of [[Sweden]] therefore declined the order; it was too common in his eyes. Napoleon's own decorations were captured by the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussians]] and were displayed in the {{lang|de|Zeughaus}} (armoury) in Berlin until 1945. Today, they are in Moscow.

===Restoration of the Bourbon King of France in 1814===

[[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] changed the appearance of the order, but it was not abolished. To have done so would have angered the 35,000 to 38,000 members. The images of Napoleon and his eagle were removed and replaced by the image of King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], the popular first king of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] line. Three Bourbon {{lang|fr|[[fleur-de-lys|fleurs-de-lys]]}} replaced the eagle on the reverse of the order. A king's crown replaced the imperial crown. In 1816, the grand cordons were renamed grand crosses and the legionnaires became knights. The king decreed that the commandants were now commanders. The {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} became the second-ranking order of knighthood of the French monarchy, after the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]].

===July Monarchy===
[[File:Louis Philippe King of the French 1843.jpg|thumb|[[Louis Philippe I]], King of the French, wearing the sash of the order]]
Following the overthrow of the Bourbons in favour of King [[Louis Philippe I]] of the [[House of Orléans]], the Bourbon monarchy's orders were once again abolished and the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} was restored in 1830 as the paramount decoration of the French nation. The insignia were drastically altered; the cross now displayed [[flag of France|tricolour flags]]. In 1847, there were 47,000 members.

===Second Republic===
Yet another revolution in Paris (in 1848) brought a new republic (the second) and a new design to the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}}. A nephew of the founder, [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]], was elected president and he restored the image of his uncle on the crosses of the order. In 1852, the first recorded woman, [[Angélique Brûlon|Angélique Duchemin]], an old revolutionary of the 1789 uprising against the absolute monarchy, was admitted into the order. On 2 December 1851, President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte staged a [[coup d'état]] with the help of the armed forces. He made himself [[Emperor of the French]] exactly one year later on 2 December 1852, after a successful [[plebiscite]].

===Second Empire===
An Imperial crown was added. During [[Napoleon III]]'s reign, the first American was admitted: [[Thomas Wiltberger Evans]], dentist of Napoleon III.

===Third Republic===
[[File:111-SC-38214 - NARA - 55235582-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Philippe Pétain]] and [[John J. Pershing]] were decorated with the ''Grand-croix'' of the Legion of Honor, as were several US generals with the ''Commandeur'' and ''Chevalier'' medal shortly after World War I in 1919.]]
In 1870, the defeat of the French Imperial Army in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] brought the end of the Empire and the creation of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871–1940). As France changed, the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} changed as well. The crown was replaced by a [[laurel wreath|laurel]] and oak wreath. In 1871, during the [[Paris Commune]] uprising, the {{lang|fr|[[Palais de la Légion d'Honneur|Hôtel de Salm]]}}, headquarters of the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}}, was burned to the ground in fierce street combats; the archives of the order were lost.

In the second term of President [[Jules Grévy]], which started in 1885, newspaper journalists brought to light the trafficking of Grévy's son-in-law, Daniel Wilson, in the awarding of decorations of the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}}. Grévy was not accused of personal participation in this scandal, but he was slow to accept his indirect political responsibility, which caused his eventual resignation on 2 December 1887.

During [[World War I]], some 55,000 decorations were conferred, 20,000 of which went to foreigners. The large number of decorations resulted from the new posthumous awards authorised in 1918. Traditionally, membership in the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} could not be awarded posthumously.

===Fourth and Fifth Republics===
The establishment of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in 1946 brought about the latest change in the design of the Legion of Honour. The date "1870" on the obverse was replaced by a single star. No changes were made after the establishment of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] in 1958.

==Organization==
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2020}}
===Legal status and leadership===
The Legion of Honour is a national order of France, meaning a public incorporated body. The Legion is regulated by a [[code (law)|civil law code]], the "Code of the Legion of Honour and of the Military Medal". While the [[President of France|President of the French Republic]] is the Grand Master of the order, day-to-day running is entrusted to the Grand Chancery (''{{lang|fr|Grande Chancellerie de la Légion d'honneur}}'').

====Grand Master====
<!--this section linked from infobox above-->
Since the establishment of the Legion, the Grand Master of the order has always been the Emperor, King or President of France. [[President of France|President]] [[Emmanuel Macron]] therefore became the Grand Master of the Legion on 14 May 2017.
[[File:GrandCollier.jpg|thumb|Insignia of the Grand Master at the Elysee Palace]]
The Grand Master appoints all other members of the order, on the advice of the French government. The Grand Master's insignia is the [[Grand Collar]] of the Legion, worn only by the President of the Republic, as Grand Master of the order.

====The Grand Chancery====
The Grand Chancery is headed by the Grand Chancellor, usually a retired general, and the Secretary General, a civilian administrator.
* Grand Chancellor: [[Army General (France)|General]] [[Benoît Puga]] (since 23 August 2016)
* Secretary-General: [[Luc Fons]] (since 2007)

The Grand Chancery also regulates the [[National Order of Merit (France)|National Order of Merit]] and the ''{{lang|fr|[[médaille militaire]]}}'' (Military Medal). There are several structures funded by and operated under the authority of the Grand Chancery, like the [[Maison d'éducation de la Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honour Schools]] (''{{lang|fr|Maisons d'éducation de la Légion d'Honneur}}'') and the [[Musée de la Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honour Museum]] (''{{lang|fr|Musée de la Légion d'Honneur}}''). The Legion of Honour Schools are élite boarding schools in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] and Les Loges in the forest of [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. Study there is restricted to daughters, granddaughters, and great-granddaughters of members of the order, the ''{{lang|fr|[[médaille militaire]]}}'' or the ''{{lang|fr|[[ordre national du Mérite]]}}''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melh.info/spip.php?rubrique4|title=Modalités d'admission|website=Maison d’éducation de la Légion d’honneur|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225155804/http://www.melh.info/spip.php?rubrique4|archive-date=25 December 2013}}</ref>

===Membership===
{{see also|Lists of Légion d'honneur recipients}}
There are five classes in the Legion of Honour:

* '''{{lang|fr|Chevalier}}''' (Knight): minimum 20 years of public service or 25 years of professional activity with "eminent merits"
* '''{{lang|fr|Officier}}''' (Officer): minimum 8 years in the rank of {{lang|fr|Chevalier}}
* '''{{lang|fr|Commandeur}}''' (Commander): minimum 5 years in the rank of {{lang|fr|Officier}}
* '''{{lang|fr|Grand officier}}''' (Grand Officer): minimum 3 years in the rank of {{lang|fr|Commandeur}}
* '''{{lang|fr|Grand-croix}}''' (Grand Cross): minimum 3 years in the rank of {{lang|fr|Grand-officier}}

The "eminent merits" required to be awarded the order require the flawless performance of one's trade as well as doing more than ordinarily expected, such as being creative, zealous and contributing to the growth and well-being of others.

The order has a maximum quota of 75 Grand Cross, 250 Grand Officers, 1,250 Commanders, 10,000 Officers, and 113,425 (ordinary) Knights. {{As of|2010|post=,}} the actual membership was 67 Grand Cross, 314 Grand Officers, 3,009 Commanders, 17,032 Officers and 74,384 Knights. Appointments of veterans of [[World War II]], French military personnel involved in the [[North African Campaign]] and other foreign French military operations, as well as wounded soldiers, are made independently of the quota.

Members convicted of a felony ({{lang|fr|crime}} in French) are automatically dismissed from the order. Members convicted of a misdemeanour ({{lang|fr|délit}} in French) can be dismissed as well, although this is not automatic.

Wearing the decoration of the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} without having the right to do so is a serious offence. Wearing the ribbon or [[rosette (decoration)|rosette]] of a foreign order is prohibited if that ribbon is mainly red, like the ribbon of the Legion of Honour. French military personnel in uniform must salute other military members in uniform wearing the medal, whatever the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur}} rank and the military rank of the bearer. This is not mandatory with the ribbon. In practice, however, this is rarely done.

There is not a single, complete list of all the members of the Legion in chronological order. The number is estimated at one million, including about 2,900 Knights Grand Cross.<ref>{{cite book| author = M. Wattel, B. Wattel. | title = Les Grand'Croix de la Légion d'honneur de 1805 à nos jours. Titulaires français et étrangers |location= Paris |date = 2009 |publisher= Archives & Culture | isbn = 978-2-35077-135-9| ref = M. et B. Wattel}}</ref>

====French nationals====
French nationals, men and women, can be received into the {{lang|fr|Légion}}, for "eminent merit" ({{lang|fr|mérites éminents}}) in military or civil life. In practice, in current usage, the order is conferred to entrepreneurs, high-level [[French Civil Service|civil servants]], scientists, artists, including famous actors and actresses, sport [[champion]]s,{{efn|All Olympic Gold Medal winners are awarded the {{lang|fr|Légion}}.}} and others with connections in the [[executive branch|executive]]. Members of the [[French Parliament]] cannot receive the order, except for valour in war,<ref>{{lang|fr|Légion}} Code, article R22</ref> and ministers are not allowed to nominate their accountants.

Until 2008, French nationals could only enter the Legion of Honour at the class of {{lang|fr|Chevalier}} (Knight). To be promoted to a higher class, one had to perform new eminent services in the interest of France and a set number of years had to pass between appointment and promotion. This was however amended in 2008 when entry became possible at Officer, Commander and Grand Officer levels, as a recognition of "extraordinary careers" ({{lang|fr|carrières hors du commun}}). In 2009, [[Simone Veil]] became the first person to enter the Order at Grand Officer level.<ref>{{cite news |language=fr |title=Simone Veil grand officier de la légion d'honneur |url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/culture/20081231.OBS7893/simone-veil-grand-officier-de-la-legion-d-honneur.html |newspaper=[[Le Nouvel Observateur]] |location=Paris |date=31 December 2008 |access-date=25 August 2015 }}</ref> Veil was a member of the {{lang|fr|[[Académie française]]}}, a former [[Minister of Health (France)|Health Minister]] and [[President of the European Parliament]], as well as an [[Auschwitz]] survivor. She was promoted to Grand Cross in 2012.

The acceptance of being awarded the Legion of Honour is not mandatory. The composers [[Maurice Ravel]]<ref>{{Cite book |title=Proof through the night music and the great war |last=Watkins |first=Glenn |date=1 January 2003 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520927896 |oclc=937278246 }}</ref> and [[Charles Koechlin]], for example, declined the award when it was offered to them.{{citation needed |date=January 2016}}

====Collective awards====
Collective appointments can be made to cities, institutions or companies. A total of 64 settlements in France have been decorated, as well as six foreign cities: [[Liège (city)|Liège]] in 1914,<ref>{{cite web |title=Liège. From the siege of 1914 to the honours of 1919 - The image of Belgium - RTBF World War 1 |url=https://www.rtbf.be/ww1/topics/detail_liege-from-the-siege-of-1914-to-the-honours-of-1919?id=8355948 |website=RTBF |accessdate=18 June 2020 |language=en}}</ref> [[Belgrade]] in 1920,<ref>{{cite web |title=Received Decorations |url=http://www.beograd.rs/en/discover-belgrade/201227-received-decorations/ |website=www.beograd.rs |accessdate=18 June 2020}}</ref> [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg City]] in 1957, [[Volgograd]] (the World War II 'Stalingrad') in 1984,<ref>{{cite news |title=What is the Legion d'Honneur? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3742905.stm |accessdate=18 June 2020 |work=BBC News |date=24 May 2004}}</ref> [[Algiers]] in 2004, and [[London]] in 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=French President Macron presents London with the Legion d'Honneur |url=https://news.sky.com/video/french-president-macron-presents-london-with-the-legion-dhonneur-12009757 |accessdate=18 June 2020 |work=Sky News |date=18 June 2020 |language=en}}</ref> French towns display the decoration in their [[civic heraldry|municipal coat of arms]].

Organisations to receive the honour include the [[French Red Cross]] ({{lang|fr|Croix-Rouge Française}}), the {{lang|fr|Abbaye de Nôtre-Dame des Dombes}} ([[Abbey of Notre-Dame des Dombes|Abbey of {{lang|fr|Notre-Dame des Dombes|nocat=y}}]]), the French National Railway Company ({{lang|fr|[[SNCF]], Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français}}), the {{lang|fr|Préfecture de Police de la Ville de Paris}} ([[Prefecture of Police of Paris]]), and various {{lang|fr|[[Grandes Écoles]]}} (National (Elite) Colleges) and other educational establishments.

====Military awards====
[[File:Ordre national de la Légion d’Honneur, Croix de Chevalier attribuée au lieutenant Tessier.jpg|thumb|Notice of posthumous award of the {{lang|fr|Croix de Chevalier}} to Lieutenant Tessier—{{lang|fr|[[Mort pour la France]]}} ("Died for France") in [[World War I]]]]

The military distinctions ({{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur à titre militaire}}) are awarded for bravery ({{lang|fr|actions de guerre}}) or for service.

* award for extreme bravery: the {{lang|fr|Légion d'Honneur}} is awarded jointly with a [[mention in dispatches]]. This is the top valour award in France. It is rarely awarded, mainly to soldiers who have died in battle.
* award for service: the {{lang|fr|Légion}} is awarded without any citation.

=====French service-members=====
For active-duty commissioned officers, the Legion of Honour award for service is achieved after 20 years of meritorious service, having been awarded the rank of {{lang|fr|Chevalier}} of the {{lang|fr|[[Ordre National du Mérite]]}}. Bravery awards lessen the time needed for the award—in fact decorated servicemen become directly chevaliers of the {{lang|fr|Légion d'Honneur}}, skipping the {{lang|fr|Ordre du Mérite}}. NCOs almost never achieve that award, except for the most heavily decorated service members.

=====Collective military awards=====
Collective appointments can be made to military units. In the case of a military unit, its flag is decorated with the insignia of a knight, which is a different award from the {{lang|fr|[[fourragère]]}}. Twenty-one schools, mainly schools providing reserve officers during the World Wars, were awarded the Légion d'Honneur. Foreign military units can be decorated with the order, such as the [[U.S. Military Academy]].

The Flag or Standard of the following units was decorated with the Cross of a Knight of the Legion of Honour:{{efn|Officially, military units are not members of the Legion of Honour, which include only individuals. As for foreign Legionnaires, they are "decorated with the Legion of Honour insignia", not "member of the Legion of Honour". Do not confuse military units that received the {{lang|fr|[[fourragère]]}} to the colour of the ribbon of the Legion of Honour (units quoted at six, seven or eight times in the order of the army with military units whose flag is decorated with the Cross of the Legion of Honour.}}

==Classes and insignia==
[[File:Wearing of the insignia of the Légion d'honneur (gentlemens).svg|thumb|upright=3.2|center|The five classes wearing their respective insignia (gentlemen): 1: ''{{lang|fr|Chevalier}}''; 2: ''{{lang|fr|Officier}}''; 3: ''{{lang|fr|Commandeur}}''; 4: ''{{lang|fr|Grand-officier}}''; 5: ''{{lang|fr|Grand-croix}}''.]]

The order has had five levels since the reign of King Louis XVIII, who restored the order in 1815. Since the reform, the following distinctions have existed:

* Three ranks:
** ''{{lang|fr|Chevalier}}'' (knight): badge worn on left breast suspended from ribbon
** ''{{lang|fr|Officier}}'' (Officer): badge worn on left breast suspended from a ribbon with a [[rosette (decoration)|rosette]]
** ''{{lang|fr|Commandeur}}'' (Commander): badge around neck suspended from ribbon necklet
* Two dignities:
** ''{{lang|fr|Grand officier}}'' (Grand Officer): badge worn on left breast suspended from a ribbon, with star displayed on right breast
** ''{{lang|fr|Grand-croix}}'' (Grand Cross), formerly ''{{lang|fr|Grande décoration}}'', ''{{lang|fr|Grand aigle}}'', or ''{{lang|fr|Grand cordon}}'': the highest level; badge affixed to sash worn over the right shoulder, with star displayed on left breast

The ''badge'' of the {{lang|fr|Légion}} is shaped as a five-armed "Maltese [[Asterisk]]", using five distinctive "arrowhead" shaped arms inspired by the [[Maltese Cross (symbol)|Maltese Cross]]. The badge is rendered in [[gilding|gilt]] (in silver for chevalier) enameled white, with an enameled [[laurel wreath|laurel]] and [[oak]] wreath between the arms. The obverse central disc is in gilt, featuring the head of [[Marianne]], surrounded by the legend ''{{lang|fr|République Française}}'' on a blue enamel ring. The reverse central disc is also in gilt, with a set of crossed ''{{lang|fr|[[flag of France|tricolores]]}}'', surrounded by the Légion's motto ''{{lang|fr|Honneur et Patrie}}'' (Honour and Fatherland) and its foundation date on a blue enamel ring. The badge is suspended by an enameled laurel and oak wreath.

The ''star'' (or ''{{lang|fr|plaque}}'') is worn by the Grand Cross (in gilt on the left chest) and the Grand Officer (in silver on the right chest) respectively; it is similar to the badge, but without enamel, and with the wreath replaced by a cluster of rays in between each arm. The central disc features the head of [[Marianne]], surrounded by the legend ''{{lang|fr|République Française}}'' (French Republic) and the motto ''{{lang|fr|Honneur et Patrie}}''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Legion of Honor in 10 questions|url=http://www.legiondhonneur.fr/en/page/legion-honor-10-questions/406|publisher=The Grand Chancery of the Legion of Honor|accessdate=18 September 2017}}</ref>

The ''[[ribbon]]'' for the medal is plain red.

The badge or star is not usually worn, except at the time of the decoration ceremony or on a [[dress uniform]] or [[formal wear]]. Instead, one normally wears the ribbon or rosette on one's suit.

For less formal occasions, recipients wear a simple stripe of thread sewn onto the lapel (red for chevaliers and officiers, silver for commandeurs). Except when wearing a dark suit with a lapel, women instead typically wear a small lapel pin called a barrette. Recipients purchase the special thread and barrettes at a store in Paris near the Palais Royal.<ref>{{cite web |last=Donadio |first=Rachel |date=11 May 2008 |title=That Isn't Lint on My Lapel, I'm an Officier |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11chevalier.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=7 August 2020}}</ref>
