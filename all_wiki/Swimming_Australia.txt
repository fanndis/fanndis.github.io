'''Swimming Australia''' is the peak governing body for competitive swimming in Australia. The body has approximately 100,000 registered members nationally in 1100 clubs across the country, which includes swimmers, coaches, officials, administrators and volunteers. The body oversees the management and development of the sport from the national team at the elite level, the conduct of national and international events, through to grass roots participation. The organisation's vision is to become Australia's leading sport through increased participation, continual outstanding performance and commercial excellence.

In 1985, the organisation had approximately 90,000 registered members.<ref name=ASC-1985-7>{{cite book|author1=Department of Sport, Recreation and Tourism|author2=Australian Sport Commission|title=Australian Sport, a profile|publisher=Australian Government Publish Service|location=Canberra, Australia|year=1985|isbn=0-644-03667-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/australiansport00aust/page/187 187]|url=https://archive.org/details/australiansport00aust/page/187}}</ref>

==History==
Competitive national swimming championships were first held in 1894. Australia had swimmers at most major international swimming events since the [[1896 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=ASC-1985>{{cite book|author1=Department of Sport, Recreation and Tourism|author2=Australian Sport Commission|title=Australian Sport, a profile|publisher=Australian Government Publish Service|location=Canberra, Australia|year=1985|isbn=0-644-03667-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/australiansport00aust/page/186 186]|url=https://archive.org/details/australiansport00aust/page/186}}</ref>

This interest led to the creation of the '''Amateur Swimming Union of Australia''', the precursor to Swimming Australia, which was founded in 1909 at a meeting of state swimming representatives at the Sports Club on [[Hunter Street, Sydney|Hunter Street]] in [[Sydney central business district|Sydney's CBD]]. There they established a charter which included the key features of the promotion of uniformity of rules and regulations across Australia; the adjudication all matters of disputes between affiliated associations; the control and management of swimmers visiting Australia; the control and management of Australian representatives in any contest of international nature; and control the recognition of all "best on record" performances.<ref name=swimausthistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.swimming.org.au/upload/swimming%20australia/about%20us/organisation%20&%20administration/organisational%20structure/organisational%20information%20may%202006.pdf|title=Organisational History|publisher=Swimming Australia|access-date=1 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825165849/http://swimming.org.au/upload/swimming%20australia/about%20us/organisation%20%26%20administration/organisational%20structure/organisational%20information%20may%202006.pdf|archive-date=25 August 2006|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>

Within a short time the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia had extended its charter to include negotiation with the recently formed [[International Swimming Federation]] (Fédération Internationale de Natation, FINA).

[[James Taylor (sports administrator)|James Taylor]] was the foundation president and served for the first 35 years of the body's existence from 1909 to 1944.

During 1985, under a new corporate structure, the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia was incorporated in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and became '''Australian Swimming''' Inc.

On 1 October 2004, Australian Swimming became a [[company limited by guarantee]] and changed its name to Swimming Australia Ltd.<ref>{{cite news|title=Neil Martin takes reins over Swimming Australia|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2004%2D09/19/content%5F1994835.htm|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]]|date=18 September 2004|accessdate=4 February 2007}}</ref> [[Glenn Tasker]] served as the chief executive officer until June 2008, and the organisation's headquarters is located at Unit 12, 7 Beissel Street, [[Belconnen, Australian Capital Territory|Belconnen]], ACT. In 2013, Mark Anderson was appointed CEO.

The Australian Swim Team underwent a rebranding in 2014 and was renamed the Australian Dolphins Swimming Team.

Swimming Australia supports and runs the [[Swimming Australia National Training Centre]] at the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] in Canberra.
