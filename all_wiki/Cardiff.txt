'''Cardiff''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑːr|d|ɪ|f}}; {{lang-cy|Caerdydd}} {{IPA-cy|kairˈdiːð, kaːɨrˈdɨːð||Caerdydd.ogg}}) is a city, a [[principal area]] and the capital of [[Wales]]. Officially known as the '''City and County of Cardiff''', it is the [[United Kingdom]]'s eleventh-largest city and the chief commercial centre of Wales. Cardiff is the base for the [[Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament|Senedd]], most national cultural institutions and the Welsh media. At the 2011 census, the [[Local government in Wales|unitary authority area]] population was estimated to be 346,090,<ref name=":0" /> and the wider urban area 479,000.<ref name="statswales.gov.wales" /> In 2011, Cardiff was sixth in the world in the [[National Geographic (magazine)|''National Geographic'' magazine]]'s list of alternative tourist destinations.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-13875925 |work=BBC News |title='Gem' Cardiff in world's top 10 places to visit in 2011 |date=22 June 2011 |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917201359/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-13875925 |archive-date=17 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Cardiff is the most popular visitor destination in Wales with 21.3&nbsp;million visitors in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://businessnewswales.com/cardiff-boasts-record-visitor-numbers-during-2017/|title=Cardiff Boasts Record Visitor Numbers During 2017|date=26 March 2018|work=Business News Wales|access-date=7 July 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707203046/https://businessnewswales.com/cardiff-boasts-record-visitor-numbers-during-2017/|archive-date=7 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Cardiff is the [[county town]] of the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Glamorgan]], and in 1974, [[South Glamorgan]]. Cardiff is part of the [[Eurocities]] network of the largest European cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocities.org/ |title=Eurocities |accessdate=20 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928110159/http://www.eurocities.org/main.php |archive-date=28 September 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> A small town until the early 19th century, its prominence as a [[port|major port]] for the transport of coal following the arrival of industry in the region contributed to its rise as a major city. In 1905, Cardiff was made a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] and proclaimed the [[capital of Wales]] in 1955. In the 2011 Census, the population was 346,100. The [[Cardiff Urban Area|Cardiff Built-up Area]] covers a slightly larger area outside the county boundary and includes the towns of [[Dinas Powys]] and [[Penarth]].

Since the 1980s, Cardiff has seen significant development. A new waterfront area at [[Cardiff Bay]] contains the [[Senedd building]] (the Welsh Parliament) and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] arts complex. Current developments include the continuation of the redevelopment of the Cardiff Bay and city centre areas with projects such as the [[Cardiff International Sports Village]], the [[Roath Lock|BBC drama village]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Proposed BBC Drama Village at Media Capital, Roath Basin |url=http://wales.gov.uk/publications/accessinfo/drnewhomepage/economicdrs/2010/bbcdramavillage/?lang=en |publisher=Welsh Assembly Government |accessdate=6 April 2011 |date=14 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315165706/http://wales.gov.uk/publications/accessinfo/drnewhomepage/economicdrs/2010/bbcdramavillage/?lang=en |archive-date=15 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and a new business district in the city centre.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cardiff Business District 'needs skills and transport' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12905961 |publisher=BBC Wales |accessdate=6 April 2011 |date=30 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402184433/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12905961 |archive-date=2 April 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{lang|cy|Caerdydd}} (the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name of the city) derives from the [[Middle Welsh]] {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}}. The change from {{lang|wlm|-dyf}} to {{lang|cy|-dydd}} shows the colloquial alteration of Welsh ''f'' {{IPA-cy|v|}} and ''dd'' {{IPA-cy|ð|}}, and was perhaps also driven by [[folk etymology]] ({{lang|cy|dydd}} is Welsh for 'day' whereas *{{lang|cy|dyf}} has no obvious meaning). This [[sound change]] had probably first occurred in the [[Middle Ages]]; both forms were current in the [[Tudor period]]. {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}} has its origins in [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] words meaning "the fort of the [[River Taff|Taff]]". The [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] probably refers to that established by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. {{lang|cy|Caer}} is Welsh for ''fort'' and {{lang|cy|-dyf}} is in effect a form of {{lang|cy|Taf}} (Taff), the river which flows by Cardiff Castle, with the {{angle bracket|t}} showing [[consonant mutation]] to {{angle bracket|d}} and the vowel showing [[affection (linguistics)|affection]] as a result of a (lost) [[genitive case]] ending.<ref name=hwo>Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan, ''Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales''. University of Wales Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-84323-901-9}}, p. 70.</ref>

The [[anglicisation|anglicised]] ''Cardiff'' is derived from {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}}, with the Welsh ''f'' {{IPA-cy|v|}} borrowed as ''ff'' {{IPAc-en|f|}}, as also happens in ''Taff'' (from Welsh {{lang|cy|Taf}}) and ''[[Llandaff]]'' (from Welsh {{lang|cy|Llandaf}}).

The antiquarian [[William Camden]] (1551–1623) suggested that the name Cardiff may derive from *{{lang|wlm|Caer-Didi}} ("the Fort of Didius"), a name supposedly given in honour of {{lang|la|[[Aulus Didius Gallus]]|italic=no}}, governor of a nearby province at the time when the Roman fort was established. Although some sources repeat this theory, it has been rejected on linguistic grounds by modern scholars such as Professor {{lang|cy|Gwynedd|italic=no}} Pierce.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff |title=What's In A Name? – Cardiff |last=Pierce |first=Gwynedd O |publisher=BBC Wales |accessdate=17 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115122320/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff |archive-date=15 January 2009}}</ref>

Little is known about the fort and civilian settlement in the period between the Roman departure from Britain and the Norman Conquest. The settlement probably shrank in size and may even have been abandoned. In the absence of Roman rule, Wales was divided into small kingdoms; early on, [[Meurig ap Tewdrig]] emerged as the local king in [[Glywysing]] (which later became [[Glamorgan]]). The area passed through his family until the advent of the Normans in the 11th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rees |first=William |title=Cardiff: A History of the City |publisher=The Corporation of the City of Cardiff |year=1969 |pages=4–5}}</ref>

=== Building of the docks ===
{{main|Cardiff Docks}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cardiff Docks.jpg|thumb|[[Tiger Bay|Cardiff Docks]]—from where coal was shipped throughout the world]] -->
In 1793, [[John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute]] was born. He would spend his life building the Cardiff docks and would later be called "the creator of modern Cardiff".<ref name="Cardiffians"/> A twice-weekly boat service between Cardiff and [[Bristol]] was established in 1815,<ref name="Bob Sanders 2"/> and in 1821, the Cardiff Gas Works was established.<ref name="Bob Sanders 2"/>

After the Napoleonic Wars Cardiff entered a period of social and industrial unrest, starting with the trial and hanging of [[Dic Penderyn]] in 1831.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brief History of Wales|last=Morgan|first=Gerald|publisher=Y Lolfa|year=2011|isbn=978-1847710185}}</ref>

The town grew rapidly from the 1830s onwards, when the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute|Marquess of Bute]] built a [[dock (maritime)|dock]], which eventually linked to the [[Taff Vale Railway]]. Cardiff became the main port for exports of coal from the [[Cynon Valley|Cynon]], [[Rhondda]], and [[Rhymney Valley|Rhymney]] valleys, and grew at a rate of nearly 80% per decade between 1840 and 1870. Much of the growth was due to [[human migration|migration]] from within and outside Wales: in 1841, a quarter of Cardiff's population were English-born and more than 10% had been born in Ireland.<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Leary |first=Paul |title=Irish Migrants in Modern Wales |publisher=Liverpool University Press |year=2004 |page=14 |isbn=978-0-85323-858-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qkCmYNMVMxwC |accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref> By the 1881 census, Cardiff had overtaken both Merthyr and Swansea to become the largest town in Wales.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Francis Michael Longstreth |title=The Cambridge Social History of Britain, 1750–1950 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=311 |isbn=978-0-521-43816-2 |year=1993 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eozO2RzSAVUC&pg=PA311}}</ref> Cardiff's new status as the premier town in South Wales was confirmed when it was chosen as the site of the [[University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire]] in 1883.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/>

A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of [[Maindy Barracks]] in 1877.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-25831-detroit-st-vincent-block-at-maindy-barrac |title=Detroit & St Vincent block at Maindy Barracks, Cathays |publisher=British Listed buildings |accessdate=23 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424005035/http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-25831-detroit-st-vincent-block-at-maindy-barrac |archive-date=24 April 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Cardiff faced a challenge in the 1880s when [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies of Llandinam]] and the [[Barry Railway Company]] promoted the development of rival docks at [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]]. Barry docks had the advantage of being accessible in all [[tide]]s, and David Davies claimed that his venture would cause "grass to grow in the streets of Cardiff". From 1901 coal exports from Barry surpassed those from Cardiff, but the administration of the coal trade remained centred on Cardiff, in particular its [[Coal Exchange]], where the price of coal on the British market was determined and the first million-pound deal was struck in 1907.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/> The city also strengthened its industrial base with the decision of the owners of the [[Dowlais Ironworks]] in Merthyr (who would later form part of [[GKN|Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds]]) to build a new [[steel mill|steelworks]] close to the docks at East Moors, which Lord Bute opened on 4 February 1891.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=33&coll_id=77663&expand= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104023150/http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=33&coll_id=77663&expand= |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 January 2009 |title=East Moors Steelworks, Cardiff collection (record of information achival) |date=1 February 2006 |publisher=Glamorgan Records Office |accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref>

===County Borough of Cardiff===
Cardiff became a county borough on 1 April 1889 under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. The town had grown rapidly and had a population of more than 123,000. Cardiff retained its county borough status until 1974.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Row |first1=B. W. |last2=Squire |first2=F.

=== City and capital city status ===
[[File:Welsh National War Memorial - geograph.org.uk - 904583.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Welsh National War Memorial]]]]
[[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] granted Cardiff [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] on 28 October 1905,<ref>{{cite book |last=Beckett |first=J.V. |title=City Status in the British Isles, 1830–2002 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd |year=2005 |page=2 |isbn=978-0-7546-5067-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC&pg=PP8 |accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref> and the city acquired a Roman Catholic cathedral in 1916. Later, more national institutions came to the city, including the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum of Wales]], the [[Welsh National War Memorial]], and the [[University of Wales]] Registry Building. But it was denied the [[National Library of Wales]], partly because the library's founder, Sir John Williams, considered Cardiff to have "a non-Welsh population".<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/>

After a brief post-war boom, Cardiff docks entered a prolonged decline in the [[interwar period]]. By 1936, their trade was less than half its value in 1913, reflecting the slump in demand for [[South Wales coalfield|Welsh coal]].<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/> Bomb damage during the [[Cardiff Blitz]] in World War II included the devastation of [[Llandaff Cathedral]], and in the immediate postwar years the city's link with the Bute family came to an end.

The stalemate between Cardiff and cities such as Caernarfon and Aberystwyth was not broken until Cardiganshire County Council decided to support Cardiff; and in a new local authority vote, 134 out of 161 voted for Cardiff.<ref name="Johnes 2012" />

Cardiff therefore celebrated two important [[anniversary|anniversaries]] in 2005. The Encyclopedia of Wales notes that the decision to recognise the city as the capital of Wales "had more to do with the fact that it contained marginal [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] constituencies than any reasoned view of what functions a Welsh capital should have". Although the city hosted the [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1958, Cardiff only became a centre of national administration with the establishment of the [[Welsh Office]] in 1964, which later prompted the creation of various other public bodies such as the [[Arts Council of Wales]] and the [[Welsh Development Agency]], most of which were based in Cardiff.

Senedd Cymru (the Welsh Parliament) has been based in Cardiff Bay since its formation in 1999 as the National Assembly for Wales. The Senedd building was opened on 1 March 2006 by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/tm_objectid=16757822&method=full&siteid=50082&headline=queen-to-open-wales--senedd-name_page.html |title=Queen to open Wales' Senedd |date=1 March 2006 |publisher=WalesOnline.co.uk |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/683gTl7My?url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/tm_objectid%3D16757822%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D50082%26headline%3Dqueen-to-open-wales--senedd-name_page.html |archive-date=31 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Member of the Senedd|Members of the Senedd Cymru (MS)]], the Senedd Commission and ministerial support staff are based in Cardiff Bay. Cardiff elects four constituency Senedd Members (MS) to the Senedd; the constituencies for the Senedd are the same as for the UK Parliament. All of the city's electors have an extra vote for the [[South Wales Central (Senedd Cymru electoral region)|South Wales Central]] regional members; this system increases proportionality to the Senedd. The most recent Senedd general election was held on [[2016 National Assembly for Wales election|5 May 2016]].

The [[Welsh Government]] has its headquarters in Cardiff's [[Cathays Park]] where most of its civil servants are based, with smaller numbers in other locations in the [[Cardiff City Centre|city centre]], [[Cathays]], [[Canton, Cardiff|Canton]], and [[Cardiff Bay]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wales.gov.uk/contact_us/officelocations/southeastwalesoffices/cardiff/?lang=en |title=Offices in Cardiff |publisher=Welsh Government |date=15 October 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406020251/http://wales.gov.uk/contact_us/officelocations/southeastwalesoffices/cardiff/?lang=en |archive-date=6 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There are other Welsh Government offices in other parts of Wales such as Llandudno and Aberystwyth and there are also international offices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wales.gov.uk/contact_us/officelocations/?lang=en |title=Office locations |publisher=Welsh Government |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221171036/http://wales.gov.uk/contact_us/officelocations/?lang=en |archive-date=21 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Local government ===
[[File:Cardiff City Hall cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Cardiff City Hall]] in [[Cathays Park]]]]
Between 1889 and 1974 Cardiff was a county borough governed by [[Cardiff County Borough Council]] (known as Cardiff City Council after 1905). Between 1974 and 1996, Cardiff was governed by [[Cardiff City Council]], a district council of [[South Glamorgan]]. Since [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994|local government reorganisation in 1996]], Cardiff has been governed by the City and County Council of Cardiff, which is based at [[County Hall, Cardiff|County Hall]] in Atlantic Wharf, Cardiff Bay. Voters elect 75 councillors every four years.

Between the 2004 and 2012 local elections, no individual political party held a majority on Cardiff County Council. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] held the largest number of seats and Cllr [[Rodney Berman]] was Leader of the Council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2872%2C4274%2C4956&parent_directory_id=2865 |title=Council Composition |date=14 May 2008 |publisher=Cardiff County Council |accessdate=22 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927042410/http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?Parent_Directory_id=2865&nav=2872%2C4274%2C4956 |archive-date=27 September 2006}}</ref> The Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru formed a partnership administration.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics-news/2008/05/13/lib-dems-and-plaid-set-for-a-coalition-in-cardiff-91466-20899896/ |title=Lib Dems and Plaid set for a coalition in Cardiff |last=Shipton |first=Martin |date=13 May 2008 |publisher=WalesOnline |accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref> In the [[2012 Cardiff Council election|2012 elections]] the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] achieved an outright majority, after gaining an additional 33 seats across the city.

Cardiff is divided into communities. Several of these have their own [[community council]], while the rest are governed solely by Cardiff City Council. Elections are held every five years. The last contested elections would have been held at the same time as the [[2017 Cardiff Council election]], had there been more candidates standing than available seats. Those with community councils are:

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Cardiff}}
The centre of Cardiff is relatively flat and is bounded by hills on the outskirts to the east, north and west. Its location influenced its development as the world's largest coal port, most notably its proximity and easy access to the coal fields of the [[South Wales Valleys]]. The highest point in the local authority area is [[Garth Hill]], {{convert|307|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

Cardiff is built on reclaimed marshland on a bed of [[Triassic]] stones; this reclaimed marshland stretches from [[Chepstow]] to the [[Ely Estuary]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=7004 |title=Cardiff Supplementary Planning Guidance: Archaeologically Sensitive Areas |date=20 July 2006 |publisher=Cardiff County Council |accessdate=1 October 2008 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609181416/http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=7004 |archive-date=9 June 2011}}</ref> which is the natural boundary of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. Triassic landscapes of this part of the world are usually shallow and low-lying, consistent with the flatness of the centre of Cardiff.<ref>{{cite journal |year=2008 |title=Discussion on palaeoecology of the Late Triassic extinction event in the SW UK |journal=Journal of the Geological Society |publisher=Geological Society of London |volume=165 |issue=5 |pages=988–992 |url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/cgi/content/full/165/5/988 |accessdate=1 October 2008 |doi=10.1144/0016-76492008-014 |last1=Radley |first1=J.

Many of these Triassic rocks are purplish, especially the coastal marl found near Penarth. One of the Triassic rocks used in Cardiff is "Radyr Stone", a [[freestone (masonry)|freestone]] which as its name suggests is quarried in the Radyr district.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englishstone.org.uk/documents/dimension%20stone%208.html |title=Triassic building sandstone resources |accessdate=7 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610061832/http://www.englishstone.org.uk/documents/dimension%20stone%208.html |archive-date=10 June 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Cardiff has also imported some materials for buildings: [[Devonian]] sandstones (the [[Old Red Sandstone]]) from the [[Brecon Beacons]] has been used. Most famously, the buildings of [[Cathays Park]], the civic centre in the centre of the city, are built of [[Portland stone]] from Dorset.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swga.org.uk/pdf/CathaysPark.pdf |title=Geological Walks in Wales: Cathays Park |publisher=Geologists Association South Wales |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029202443/http://www.swga.org.uk/pdf/CathaysPark.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A widely used building stone in Cardiff is the yellow-grey [[Early Jurassic|Liassic]] [[limestone]] rock of the Vale of Glamorgan, including the very rare "Sutton Stone", a conglomerate of lias limestone and [[carboniferous]] limestone.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.castlewales.com/morgraig.html |title=Castell Morgraig |last=Iowerth |first=Dylan |journal=Castle Studies Group Newsletter |year=1998 |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907230838/http://castlewales.com/morgraig.html |archive-date=7 September 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Cardiff is bordered to the west by the rural district of the Vale of Glamorgan, also known as The Garden of Cardiff;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardenofcardiff.com/ |title=The Garden of Cardiff |accessdate=20 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509082545/http://www.gardenofcardiff.com/ |archive-date=9 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> to the east by the city of Newport; to the north by the [[South Wales Valleys]]; and to the south by the [[River Severn|Severn Estuary]] and [[Bristol Channel]]. The River Taff winds through the centre of the city and together with the [[River Ely]] flows into the freshwater lake of Cardiff Bay. A third river, the [[Rhymney River|Rhymney]], flows through the east of the city directly into the Severn Estuary.

Cardiff is situated near the [[Glamorgan]] [[Heritage Coast]], stretching westward from Penarth and Barry – [[commuter town]]s of Cardiff – with striped yellow-blue [[Jurassic]] limestone cliffs. The Glamorgan coast is the only part of the [[Celtic Sea]] that has exposed Jurassic ([[blue lias]]) geology. This stretch of coast, which has reefs, sandbanks and serrated cliffs, was a [[ship graveyard]]; many ships sailing to Cardiff during the industrial era were wrecked around this hostile coastline during west/south-westerly gales. Smuggling, deliberate shipwrecking and attacks on ships were also common.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kenfig.org.uk/smuggling.html |title=Smuggling Around Kenfig |publisher=Kenfig.org |accessdate=19 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422181813/http://www.kenfig.org.uk/smuggling.html |archive-date=22 April 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

To the west lie [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]], [[Caerau, Cardiff|Caerau]] and [[Fairwater, Cardiff|Fairwater]] which contain some of the largest housing estates in the United Kingdom. With the exception of some of the outlying privately built estates at [[Michaelston-super-Ely]] and 1930s developments near Waun-Gron Road, this is an economically disadvantaged area with high numbers of unemployed households.

As the capital city of Wales, Cardiff is the main engine of growth in the Welsh economy. Though the population of Cardiff is about 10% of the Welsh population, the economy of Cardiff makes up nearly 20% of Welsh GDP and 40% of the city's workforce are daily in-commuters from the surrounding south Wales area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/economic_trends/Sub-regional_&_Local_Area_GDP.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924210535/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/economic_trends/Sub-regional_%26_Local_Area_GDP.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2009 |url-status=dead |title=Sub-regional and local area gross domestic product |last=Clifton-Fearnside |first=Alex |author2=Adam Douglas |date=14 May 2002 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=18 April 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statswales.wales.gov.uk/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=4903&IF_Language=isl |title=Statistics on Commuting in Wales |date=5 December 2007 |publisher=Statistics for Wales |accessdate=18 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114021425/http://www.statswales.wales.gov.uk/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=4903&IF_Language=isl |archive-date=14 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Industry has played a major part in Cardiff's development for many centuries. The main catalyst for its transformation from a small town into a big city was the demand for coal required in making iron and later steel, brought to the sea by [[packhorse]] from [[Merthyr Tydfil]]. This was first achieved by the construction of a {{convert|25|mi|km|adj=on}} long canal from Merthyr (510 feet above sea-level) to the Taff Estuary at Cardiff.<ref name="canal">{{cite web|url=http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/the_glamorganshire_canal.htm |title=The Glamorganshire Canal |accessdate=19 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227160758/http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/the_glamorganshire_canal.htm |archive-date=27 December 2007}}</ref> Eventually the [[Taff Vale Railway]] replaced the canal barges and massive marshalling yards sprang up as new docks were developed in Cardiff – all prompted by the soaring worldwide demand for coal from the South Wales valleys. At its peak, Cardiff's port area, known as [[Tiger Bay]], became the busiest port in the world and – for some time – the world's most important coal port.<ref name="Grauniad Dinas">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jun/09/walk-guides-cardiff-wales-architecture?page=2 |title=Cardiff's millennium makeover, Cardiff – Travel – The Guardian |accessdate=2 June 2010 |date=9 June 2009 |work=The Guardian |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606214328/http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jun/09/walk-guides-cardiff-wales-architecture?page=2 |archive-date=6 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="BBC Dinas">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2854567.stm |title=BBC News – Wales – Capital claims – A city's struggle |accessdate=2 June 2010 |date=22 April 2003 |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040713044548/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2854567.stm |archive-date=13 July 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the years leading up to the First World War, more than 10&nbsp;million tonnes of coal was exported annually from [[Cardiff Docks]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/?article_id=50 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530052329/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/?article_id=50 |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 May 2012 |title=Cardiff – Coal and Shipping Metropolis of the World |publisher=National Museum of Wales |accessdate=19 April 2008 }}</ref> In 1907, Cardiff's [[Coal Exchange]] was the first host to a business deal for a million [[Pound Sterling|pounds Sterling]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glamro.gov.uk/check/Building%20of%20a%20Capital%202/A_Why.html |title=Why Did Cardiff Grow? |publisher=Glamorgan Record Office |accessdate=19 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123034747/http://www.glamro.gov.uk/check/Building%20of%20a%20Capital%202/A_Why.html |archive-date=23 November 2008  }}</ref> After a period of decline, Cardiff's port has started to grow again – over 3&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo passed through the docks in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7414502.stm |title=Ports' resurgence as imports grow |date=22 May 2008 |publisher=BBC News Wales |accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref>

It is possible to cycle the entire distance of the [[Trail]] almost completely off-road, as it largely follows the [[River Taff]] and many of the old disused railways of the Glamorganshire valleys. On Sundays in summer the Beacons Bike Bus enables cyclists to take their bikes into the Beacons and then ride back to Cardiff along the Trail.<ref>[http://www.sustrans.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/files/wales/free%20leaflets%20and%20maps/Taff%20Trail%20Leaflet_map_Final.pdf Official Taff Trail Leaflet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223045/http://www.sustrans.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/files/wales/free%20leaflets%20and%20maps/Taff%20Trail%20Leaflet_map_Final.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }} Accessed 14 September 2017</ref>

== Telecommunications ==
{{See also|List of Wales dialling codes}}

'''029''' is the current telephone dialling code for Cardiff, as well as for the neighbouring towns of Penarth, Dinas Powys and [[Caerphilly]]. The dialling code is optional when dialling within the area: one can dial between any two phones within the 029 code using only the eight-digit local number.

Prior to the [[Big Number Change]] on 22 April 2000 the area had shorter, six-digit local numbers with an area code of 01222. This was 0222 before May 1995, derived from 0 (indicating it was a trunk call) 22 (CA on a telephone pad, for CArdiff) and 2 (as 220 was used for CAmbridge and 221 for BAth). Before the introduction of automated trunk call dialling, non-local numbers were accessed through a system of manual telephone exchanges, in common with rest if the United Kingdom.

There remains a common misconception that local numbers are still six digits long and that the code is 02920, even though there are newer Cardiff numbers in the ranges (029) 21xx xxxx and (029) 22xx xxxx.

== Landmarks and attractions ==
{{See also|Architecture of Cardiff|Listed buildings in Cardiff}}
[[File:Adeilad y Pierhead, Caerdydd.jpg|thumb|[[Pierhead Building]]]]
Cardiff has many landmark buildings such as the Principality Stadium, [[Pierhead Building]] the Welsh National Museum and the Senedd building, the home of the Welsh Parliament. Cardiff is also famous for Cardiff Castle, [[St David's Hall]], [[Llandaff Cathedral]] and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]].

[[Cardiff Castle]] is a major tourist attraction in the city and is situated in the heart of the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]]. The [[St Fagans National History Museum|National History Museum at St Fagans]] in Cardiff is a large open-air museum housing dozens of buildings from throughout Welsh history that have been moved to the site in Cardiff. The Civic Centre in [[Cathays Park]] comprises a collection of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] buildings such as the [[City Hall, Cardiff|City Hall]], [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum and Gallery of Wales]], [[Cardiff Crown Court]], and buildings forming part of Cardiff University, together with more modern civic buildings. These buildings are laid out around the Queen Alexandra Gardens, a formal park which contains the [[Welsh National War Memorial]] and a number of other, smaller, memorials.

In addition to Cardiff Castle, [[Castell Coch]] (''Red Castle'') is located in [[Tongwynlais]], in the north of the city. The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian [[folly]] designed by [[William Burges]] for the Marquess and built in the 1870s, as an occasional retreat. However, the Victorian castle stands on the footings of a much older medieval castle possibly built by [[Ifor Bach]], a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions. It rarely fulfilled its intended role as a retreat for the Butes, who seldom stayed there. For the Marquess, the pleasure had been in its creation, a pleasure lost following Burges's death in 1881.

Cardiff claims to have the largest concentration of [[castles]] of any city in the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0,21043,13092_2689478,00.html |title=2007 Rugby World Cup City Guides – Cardiff |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=19 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405094448/http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0%2C21043%2C13092_2689478%2C00.html |archive-date=5 April 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> As well as Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, there are the remains of two Motte and Bailey castles in Radyr and Rhiwbina (both known as the "Twmpath", a Welsh word for a small mound),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |title=Twmpath Castle |year=2002 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307035335/http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |archive-date=7 March 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> which along with a castle at Whitchurch (known as Treoda and destroyed by housing in the 1960s) formed an arc of fortifications which divided the Norman lordship from the Welsh lordship of Senghenydd.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |title=The Gatehouse: Treoda, Whitchurch |date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=28 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815082212/http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |archive-date=15 August 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Further up the Cefn Cibwr ridge on the boundary with Caerphilly there is also another ruined castle, known as Castell Morgraig. Archaeological evidence suggests this castle was never finished, and it is debated whether the fortification was of Norman or Welsh origin. The concentration of these castles is indicative of the moveable nature of the border between the Norman lordship of Glamorgan, centred at Cardiff, and its Welsh neighbours to the north.

While not strictly castles in the historic sense, there is also the ruined [[Bishop's Palace, Llandaff|Llandaff Bishop's Palace]], a fortified residence belonging to the Bishops of Llandaff and [[St Fagans National History Museum|Saint Fagans Castle]], a preserved seventeenth century manor house, once the seat of the Earls of Plymouth.

The original circle stands in Gorsedd Gardens in front of the [[National Museum]] while its 1978 replacement is situated in [[Bute Park]]. Since 1983, Cardiff has hosted the [[BBC Cardiff Singer of the World]] competition, a world-renowned event on the opera calendar which is held every two years. The city also hosts smaller events.
