'''Wallingford''' is a town in [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]], [[Connecticut]], [[United States]] centrally located between New Haven and Hartford, and Boston and New York City. The population was 45,135 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Wallingford town, New Haven County, Connecticut| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Wallingford Center CDP, Connecticut| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| access-date=October 15, 2012}}</ref> The community was named after [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], in England.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoEyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA335|year=1903|publisher=Connecticut Magazine Company|page=335}}</ref>

== History ==
The [[Connecticut General Assembly]] created the town on October 10, 1667. This original plot of land near the [[Quinnipiac River]] is now considered Main Street. Starting on May 12, 1670, there were 126 people who lived in temporary housing, and five years later in 1675 there were 40 permanent homes.<ref name="wallingford1">{{cite web|url=http://www.town.wallingford.ct.us/Content/History_and_Description.asp |title=History and Description |publisher=Town.wallingford.ct.us |access-date=2016-08-23}}</ref>

In 1697 Wallingford was the site of the last [[witchcraft trial]] in [[New England]]. Winifred Benham was thrice tried for witchcraft and acquitted all three times.<ref>Demos, John Putnam. ''Entertaining Satan: Witchcraft and the Culture of Early New England''. Oxford Press, 2004, page 409.</ref>

The [[1878 Wallingford tornado]] struck on August 9 of that year. It killed at least 29 and likely 34 people in Wallingford, the most by any tornado event in [[History of Connecticut|Connecticut history]].

Wallingford is home to a large variety of industries and major corporations spanning the spectrum of the medical, health care, service, hi-tech specialty metal manufacturing and research development. The development of the Barnes Industrial Parks, Casimir Pulaski Industrial Park, Centract Park and MedWay Industrial Park have greatly contributed to a diversified tax base. An Interchange Zone which permits restrictive commercial development of office parks, research and development centers and hotels was created at the intersection of interstate 91 and Route 68.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About The Town of Wallingford, CT {{!}} Town of Wallingford|url=https://www.wallingford.ct.us/our-town/|access-date=2020-06-29|website=www.wallingford.ct.us}}</ref> The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, the town's largest taxpayer, has established a research and development facility in Wallingford's MedWay Industrial Park. The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company moved out in 2017 and the structures were demolished in 2018. 

In terms of Wallingford's manufacturing and design history, silver-producing companies like Hall, Elton & Co.<ref>(April 3, 2017).
