'''Air New Zealand Limited''' is the [[flag carrier]] airline of [[New Zealand]]. Based in [[Auckland]], the airline operates scheduled passenger flights to 20 domestic and 32 international destinations in 20 countries, primarily around and within the [[Pacific Rim]].<ref name=star>{{cite web|title=Air New Zealand: Facts & Figures|publisher=Star Alliance|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/about/airlines/air-new-zealand/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124024658/http://www.staralliance.com/en/about/airlines/air-new-zealand/|archive-date=24 November 2010}}</ref> The airline has been a member of the [[Star Alliance]] since 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/monthly-operating-data|title=Investor Updates|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref>

Air New Zealand originated in 1940 as [[TEAL|Tasman Empire Airways Limited]] (TEAL), a company operating [[trans-Tasman]] flights between New Zealand and Australia. TEAL became wholly owned by the [[New Zealand Government]] in 1965, whereupon it was renamed Air New Zealand. The airline served international routes until 1978, when the government merged it and the domestic [[New Zealand National Airways Corporation]] (NAC) into a single airline under the Air New Zealand name. Air New Zealand was privatised in 1989, but returned to majority government ownership in 2001 after near bankruptcy due to a failed tie up with Australian carrier [[Ansett Australia]]. In the 2017 financial year to June, Air New Zealand carried 15.95 million passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://p-airnz.com/cms/assets/PDFs/investor-update-jun-2017.pdf |title=Investor Updates June 2017 |publisher=Air New Zealand |date = 31 July 2017 |accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref>

Air New Zealand's route network focuses on [[Australasia]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], with [[long-haul flight]] services to eastern Asia, the Americas and the United Kingdom. It was the last airline to circumnavigate the world with flights to [[London]]'s [[Heathrow Airport]] via both [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]] and [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong]]. The latter ended in March 2013 when Air New Zealand stopped Hong Kong&nbsp;– London flights, in favour of a [[codeshare agreement]] with [[Cathay Pacific]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travel-nation.co.uk/roundtheworldflightsairnewzealand.html |title=Does any one airline fly all the way around the world? |publisher=Travel-nation.co.uk |accessdate=30 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/air-nz-cuts-hong-kong-london-service-ng-131898 |title=Air NZ cuts Hong Kong-London service &#124; The National Business Review |publisher=Nbr.co.nz |accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref> The airline's main hub is [[Auckland Airport]], located near [[Mangere]] in the southern part of the Auckland urban area.<ref name="FI">{{cite news | title= Directory: World Airlines | work= [[Flight International]] | page= 64 |date=27 March 2007}}</ref> Air New Zealand is headquartered in a building called "The Hub", located {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from Auckland Airport, in Auckland's [[Wynyard Quarter]].<ref>"[http://www.airnewzealand.jp/resources/environment_booklet_apr07.pdf We're committed to our environment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014224400/http://www.airnewzealand.jp/resources/environment_booklet_apr07.pdf |date=14 October 2008 }}."

{{Main|History of Air New Zealand}}
[[File:ZK-AMA on water.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The first TEAL aircraft, a [[Short Empire|Short S30]] registered as ZK-AMA and named ''[[Aotearoa]]'', on the water at [[Auckland, New Zealand]].]]

Air New Zealand began as [[Tasman Empire Airways Limited]], founded in 1939 by an international agreement between New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Its initial shareholders were the [[New Zealand Government]], [[Union Airways of N.Z. Ltd|Union Airways of New Zealand]], [[Qantas]] and the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]]. It was formed to fly [[trans-Tasman]] routes and carry passengers, cargo and mail between Australia and New Zealand. Incorporated on 26 April 1940, it started operations four days later, on 30 April. Its first flight, flown with a [[Short Empire|Short S30]] [[flying boat]], connected Auckland and Sydney.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.govt.nz/gallery/v/Walter+Nash+Exhibition/Technology/Transport/R20967257_+Folio+84.jpg.html |title=Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL) |date=7 September 2010 |accessdate=26 May 2019 |publisher=Archives New Zealand |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128003322/http://archives.govt.nz/gallery/v/Walter+Nash+Exhibition/Technology/Transport/R20967257_+Folio+84.jpg.html |archive-date=28 January 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/teal-becomes-air-new-zealand |title=TEAL becomes Air New Zealand |date=8 December 2016 |accessdate=26 May 2019 |publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage}}</ref>

Following [[World War II]], TEAL operated weekly flights from Auckland to [[Sydney]], and added [[Wellington]] and [[Fiji]] to its routings. The New Zealand and Australian governments purchased 50% stakes in TEAL in 1953,<ref name="CompanyHistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.airnz.co.nz/resources/company_history_feb_06.pdf |title=Air New Zealand History |accessdate=28 February 2007 |publisher=Air New Zealand |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621151238/http://www.airnz.co.nz/resources/company_history_feb_06.pdf |archive-date=21 June 2007 }}</ref> and the airline ended flying boat operations in favour of land-based turboprop airliners by 1960. In 1965, TEAL became Air New Zealand—the New Zealand government having purchased Australia's 50% stake in the carrier.<ref name="CompanyHistory"/>

[[File:Air New Zealand Douglas DC-8 SYD Wheatley.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Douglas DC-8]] at [[Sydney Airport]] in the early 1970s. Air New Zealand was an early operator of the DC-8. Note the pre-1973 livery with the Southern Cross on the tail.]]
With the increased range of the [[Douglas DC-8]]s the airline's first jet aircraft, Air New Zealand began transpacific services to the United States and Asia with Los Angeles and Honolulu added as destinations in 1965. The airline further acquired wide-body [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] airliners in 1973. The DC-10s introduced the new [[koru]]-inspired logo for the airline, which remains to this day.

In 1978, the domestic airline [[National Airways Corporation (New Zealand)|National Airways Corporation]] (NAC) and its subsidiary [[Straits Air Freight Express|Safe Air]] were merged into Air New Zealand to form a single national airline, further expanding the carrier's operations. As a result, NAC's [[Boeing 737]] and [[Fokker F27]] aircraft joined Air New Zealand's fleet alongside its DC-8 and DC-10 airliners. The merger also resulted in the airline having two IATA airline designators: TE from Air New Zealand and NZ from NAC. TE continued to be used for international flights and NZ for domestic flights until 1990, when international flights assumed the NZ code.<ref name="CompanyHistory"/>

In 1981, Air New Zealand introduced its first [[Boeing 747]] airliner, and a year later initiated service to London via Los Angeles. The five 747-200s owned by Air New Zealand were all named after ancestral Maori canoes. 1985 saw the introduction of [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-200ER]] airliners to fill the large size gap between the Boeing 737 and 747 (the DC-8 and DC-10 had been withdrawn by 1983). In 1989 the airline was privatised with a sale to a consortium headed by Brierley Investments Ltd.<ref name="CompanyHistory"/> (with remaining stakes held by [[Qantas]], [[Japan Airlines]], [[American Airlines]], and the New Zealand government). The New Zealand air transport market underwent [[deregulation]] in 1990, prompting Air New Zealand to acquire a 50% stake in [[Ansett Australia]] in 1995.

In March 1999, Air New Zealand became a member of the [[Star Alliance]]. From 1999 through 2000, Air New Zealand became embroiled in an ownership battle over Ansett with co-owner [[News Limited]] over a possible sale of the under-performing carrier to [[Singapore Airlines]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History - About Air New Zealand|url=https://www.airnewzealand.com.sg/history|website=www.airnewzealand.com.sg|publisher=Air New Zealand Singapore|accessdate=10 December 2017|language=en-SG}}</ref>

===Merger with Ansett===
{{further|History of Air New Zealand#Ansett collapse}}

In 2000, Air New Zealand announced that it had chosen instead to acquire the entirety of Ansett Australia (increasing its 50% stake in the carrier to 100%) for A$680 million from News Corporation Ltd. Business commentators<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/aviation/news/article.cfm?c_id=556&objectid=217059|title=Ambition flies in the face of reality|author =Brian Gaynor|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=15 September 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBMuSdPpLXkC&pg=PA103|title=Limits to Privatization: How to Avoid Too Much of a Good Thing|author1=Marianne Beisheim |author2=Ernst Ulrich Von Weizsacker |author3=Oran R. Young |author4=Matthias Finger |publisher=Earthscan|year=2005|page=103|isbn=1-84407-177-4}}</ref> believe this to have been a critical mistake, as Ansett's fleet, staffing levels and infrastructure far outweighed that of Air New Zealand. Subsequently, both carriers' profitability came under question, and foreign offers to purchase the Air New Zealand Group were considered. In September 2001, plagued by costs it could not possibly afford, the Air New Zealand / Ansett Group neared collapse. A failed attempt at purchasing Virgin Blue was the final straw, and on 12 September, out of both time and cash, Air New Zealand placed Ansett Australia into voluntary administration, following which Ansett was forced to cease operations. Air New Zealand announced a NZ$1.425 billion operating loss.<ref name="CompanyHistory"/>

===21st century===

In October 2001, Air New Zealand was re-nationalised under a New Zealand government NZ$885 million rescue plan (with the government taking an 82% stake), and subsequently received new leadership.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/|title=Government bailout of Air NZ complete|date=18 January 2002|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref> This act was the only thing that spared Air New Zealand from going into administration and likely grounding.

In 2002, Air New Zealand reconfigured its domestic operations under a [[low-cost airline]] business plan, and the New Zealand government weighed (and later refused) a proposal from [[Qantas]] to purchase a one-fifth stake in the carrier. Air New Zealand returned to profitability in 2003, reporting a net profit of $NZ165.7 million for that year. The carrier saw increasing profits through 2004 and 2005.<ref name="CompanyHistory"/> In 2004, the airline announced a comprehensive relaunch of its [[long-haul]] product, featuring the introduction of new seats in its business, [[premium economy]], and economy class cabins.

In 2003, Air New Zealand added the [[Airbus A320]] airliner to its fleet for use on [[short-haul]] international flights, and later, domestic flights. In 2005, the airline received its first [[Boeing 777]] aircraft (–200ER variant), and placed orders for the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]] in 2004. The airline later was announced as the launch customer for the -9 variant of the 787.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/air-new-zealand-787-9/index.html|title=Air New Zealand to launch world's first route for 787-9 Dreamliner {{!}} CNN Travel|date=11 November 2013|work=CNN Travel|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}</ref>

On 21 December 2010, the New Zealand government approved an alliance between Air New Zealand and Australian airline Virgin Blue (now named [[Virgin Australia]]), which allowed both airlines to expand operations between Australia and New Zealand with codeshares for [[trans-Tasman]] and connecting domestic flights; and reciprocal access to frequent flyer programmes and airport lounges. Air New Zealand subsequently purchased a 26% shareholding in [[Virgin Australia Holdings]] (Virgin Australia's parent company) to cement the relationship. By October 2016 Air New Zealand sold its remaining stake in Virgin Australia to investors and the Nasham Group.<ref>{{cite news|title=Air NZ sells remaining stake in Virgin Australia|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1610/S00362/air-nz-sells-remaining-stake-in-virgin-australia.htm|accessdate=13 March 2016|publisher=Scoop|date=12 October 2016}}</ref> On 4 April 2018, Air New Zealand ended its partnership with Virgin Australia effective 28 October 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/business/354161/air-nz-pulls-plug-on-alliance-with-virgin-australia|title=Air NZ pulls plug on alliance with Virgin Australia|date=5 April 2018|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-nz}}</ref>

In 2011, Air New Zealand introduced the Boeing 777-300ER airliner, as well as the [[#Economy SkyCouch|Economy Skycouch]], a set of three economy class seats that could be converted into a flat multi-purpose surface by raising the leg rests. After a four-year delay, Air New Zealand took delivery of its first [[Boeing 787-9]] on 9 July 2014.

In November 2013, the New Zealand Government reduced its share in Air New Zealand from 73% to 53% as part of its controversial asset sales programme. It made $365 million from this deal.<ref>{{cite news|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=Matt|title=NZ government sells 20% of Air New Zealand for $324 million|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/nz-government-sells-20-of-air-new-zealand-for-324-million-20131119-2xtcr.html|accessdate=10 December 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 November 2013}}</ref>

===Subsidiaries===
====Operations subsidiaries====
Air New Zealand Cargo is the only current subsidiary of Air New Zealand Limited.

Air New Zealand had wholly owned subsidiary [[regional airline]]s &ndash; [[Air Nelson]], [[Mount Cook Airline]] and [[Eagle Airways]]&ndash; that served secondary destinations in New Zealand. Together they made up [[Air New Zealand Link]]. On 26 August 2016 Eagle Airways ceased operations, in late 2019 Air Nelson and Mount Cook Airline were merged into its parent's operations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Melville |first1=Brent |title=Engine woes reduce Air NZ earnings |accessdate=26 December 2019 |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/business/engine-woes-reduce-air-nz-earnings|work=Otago Daily Times |date=23 August 2019}}</ref>

* '''Air Nelson''' was based in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], and operated [[Bombardier Dash 8|Bombardier Q300s]].
* '''Mount Cook Airline''' was based in [[Christchurch]], and operated [[ATR 72|ATR 72-500 and ATR 72-600]] turboprop aircraft.

Subsidiary company '''Zeal320''' was introduced to help combat increasing labour costs. Zeal320 operated Air New Zealand's trans-Tasman fleet of Airbus A320-200 aircraft under the Air New Zealand brand. On 31 July 2006, flights were re-numbered to the NZ700-999 series for trans-Tasman services, and NZ1000 series for domestic services. All of Air New Zealand's A320-200s were registered to Zeal320 until 26 November 2008, when ownership of the fleet was transferred back to Air New Zealand. However, staff that worked the A320-200 fleet were still employed by this subsidiary.

===Brand and livery===

[[File:AirNZ Koru.jpg|thumb|Air New Zealand's [[koru]] tail symbol, seen on [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft ZK-NGM]]
The Air New Zealand symbol is a Māori [[koru]], a stylised representation of a [[silver fern]] frond unfolding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Antons|first1=Christoph|title=Traditional Knowledge, Traditional Cultural Expressions, and Intellectual Property Law in the Asia-Pacific Region|date=2009|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041127211|page=285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3lpuGUiEjxMC&pg=PA285|language=en}}</ref> A redesigned logo was unveiled on 21 March 2006. The "Pacific Wave" fuselage stripes were removed from short-haul aircraft in 2009, simplifying the overall livery, and was in the process of also being removed from long haul aircraft before the logo was changed again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/worldairlinenews/archives/185685.asp |title=Air New Zealand finishes removing the Pacific Wave from its Airbus A320s |publisher=Blog.seattlepi.com |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=30 June 2013 |author =Bruce Drum}}</ref>

On 27 March 2006, Air New Zealand embarked on a changeover to a new [[brand]] identity, involving a new [[Liz Findlay|Zambesi]]-designed uniform, new logo, new colour scheme and new look check-in counters and lounges. The new uniforms featured a colour palette mirroring the [[Pounamu|greenstone]], teal, schist and slate hues of New Zealand; sea and sky (a [[Māori culture|Māori]] motif created by [[Derek Lardelli]]) fabric woven from [[merino wool]]; and curves inspired by the airline's logo symbol, the koru. A greenstone colour replaces the blue Pacific Wave colour, inspired by the colour of the [[pounamu]], the prized gemstone found in New Zealand. The Air New Zealand Koru was woven through all Air New Zealand's signage and products.

Later in 2009 staff were involved in testing fabrics and cuts of uniforms. "'It would be fair to say that the lessons from the development and introduction of the current uniform have been taken on board," said the airline's CEO after widespread public and staff criticism.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/business/2381824/Fyfe-memo-reveals-Air-NZ-revamp-and-jazz-up-plans|title=Fyfe memo reveals Air NZ revamp|last=McNabb|first=Denise|date=4 May 2009|work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion-Post]]|publisher=[[Fairfax New Zealand]]|accessdate=4 May 2009}}</ref>

A rebranding was announced in July 2012. Ditching the teal and green colours that had represented the airline since its beginnings as [[Tasman Empire Airways]] (TEAL) in 1939, black was adopted as the brand colour in a joint effort between the airline, New Zealand design agency Designworks and renowned Kiwi typographer [[Kris Sowersby]]; as well as a new logo typeface. The tails of the aircraft and the typeface changed to black, while the rest of the fuselage remained white.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Then CEO [[Rob Fyfe]] said of the rebranding: "Black has resonated well with our customers and staff who identify with it as the colour of New Zealand and a natural choice for our national airline. It inspires pride, is part of our Kiwi identity and a symbol of Kiwi success on the world stage." The airline began using black as its corporate colour ahead of a sponsorship campaign with NZ's rugby union team, the All Blacks, in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theflyingsocialnetwork.com/archives/3357 |title=NEWS: Air New Zealand's Distinctive Aircraft Tails Go Black |publisher=The Flying Social Network |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120728182101/http%3A//theflyingsocialnetwork.com/archives/3357 |archive-date=28 July 2012  }}</ref>

Another new livery was announced on 12 June 2013. In conjunction with a [[NZ$]]20 million Memorandum of Understanding with the national tourism agency [[Tourism New Zealand]] for joint marketing, TNZ granted permission for Air New Zealand to use the "New Zealand Fern Mark", a standard fern logo used and managed by Tourism NZ and [[New Zealand Trade and Enterprise|NZ Trade and Enterprise]] for international promotion, in its livery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismnewzealand.com/tourism-news-and-insights/media-releases/latest-releases/2013/06/air-new-zealand-and-tourism-new-zealand-enter-into-new-20-million-partnership/ |title=Air New Zealand and Tourism New Zealand enter into new $20 million partnership |publisher=Tourism New Zealand |date=11 June 2013 |accessdate=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707041825/http://www.tourismnewzealand.com/tourism-news-and-insights/media-releases/latest-releases/2013/06/air-new-zealand-and-tourism-new-zealand-enter-into-new-20-million-partnership/ |archive-date=7 July 2013  }}</ref>

Two new liveries were unveiled. The first is predominantly white with a black strip running downwards on the rear fuselage from the tail, adorned with a koru logo in white, to disappear downwards just aft of the junction of the wings with the fuselage. The black and white fern mark adorns the fuselage. This livery is used on most of the fleet. A select number have an all black livery with the fern in silver, including the airline's first Boeing 787-9. Extensive consumer surveys by Air New Zealand revealed 78 percent people believed the Fern Mark fits with the airline's brand and represents New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theflyingsocialnetwork.com/archives/18235 |title=Air New Zealand and Tourism New Zealand Enter into New $20 Million Partnership |publisher=The Flying Social Network |date=11 June 2013 |accessdate=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130619234547/http://www.theflyingsocialnetwork.com/archives/18235 |archive-date=19 June 2013  }}</ref> The first aircraft to be painted in this livery was rolled out on 24 September 2013.

==Cabin==
{{advert|date=March 2020}}

===Domestic===
Air New Zealand domestic services are operated in a single class all-economy configuration. Seating forward of the over-wing emergency exits on A320 aircraft are Space+ seats, with a larger pitch between seats, but otherwise are effectively economy seats.

From July 2014, Air New Zealand has four domestic fare options, each building on the previous option:
*'''Seat'''&nbsp;– the basic option, consisting of a seat, one cabin bag up to 7&nbsp;kg, and tea/coffee/water and snacks (depending on aircraft)
*'''Seat + Bag'''&nbsp;– the Seat option, plus one checked bag up to 23&nbsp;kg
*'''FlexiTime'''&nbsp;– the Seat + Bag option, plus the option to request a specific seat prior to check-in (Airpoints Gold/Elite and Koru members can request a seat regardless of fare option), and the ability to change to an earlier or later flight on the same day and route for no extra cost (subject to availability).
*'''FlexiDate'''&nbsp;– the FlexiTime option, plus an extra checked bag up to 23&nbsp;kg, and the ability to change a flight to a different date without a change fee (if the new flight is more expensive, the difference must be paid).

===Tasman and Pacific===
In response to increasing competition from low-cost carriers, namely Jetstar Airways, Air New Zealand replaced its cabin and service on short-haul international routes to Australia ("Tasman") and the Pacific Islands ("Pacific") with a new "Seats to Suit" service in 2010. Introduced on the Christchurch-Sydney route from 18 August 2010, the new service was rolled out on all routes on 17 November 2010. All international Airbus A320 aircraft were refitted with an all-economy cabin that supports four options of service. Long-haul Boeing 777 and 787 aircraft also operate on these routes.<ref name="Choice">{{cite web |url= http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/the-choice-is-all-yours |title= The choice is all yours: New Tasman and Pacific service&nbsp;– Air New Zealand |accessdate=10 November 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205202603/http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/the-choice-is-all-yours| archive-date= 5 December 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airreview.com/AirNZ/index.htm |title=Air New Zealand overview |accessdate=20 January 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Air New Zealand catering appetizer and main hk.jpg|thumb|Business class meal]]
There are four options, building on each other:
* '''Seat'''&nbsp;– the basic option, consisting of a seat, one cabin bag up to 7&nbsp;kg, tea, coffee and water, and AVOD entertainment including TV shows, music and games.
* '''Seat + Bag'''&nbsp;– the Seat option plus one checked bag up to 23&nbsp;kg.
* '''Works'''&nbsp;– the Seat + Bag option plus movies included on AVOD entertainment, an [[airline meal|in-flight meal]], non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks, and the ability to request a specific seat. Children receive a kids activity pack. This option is identical to the previous Economy option.
* '''Works Deluxe'''&nbsp;– the Works option plus priority check-in and baggage, and extra checked bag up to 23&nbsp;kg. On the A320, passengers are guaranteed an empty middle seat next to them. On flights operated by the 777 and 787, Premium Economy replaces Works Deluxe.

Air New Zealand has reintroduced '''Space+''' seats on the Trans-tasman routes, with 35&nbsp;inches of pitch in the first three rows of the A320s. These are only available to Works or Works Deluxe passengers, and only Airpoints Gold Elite and Gold members of Air New Zealand's Airpoints frequent flyer programme are allocated these seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airreview.com/AirNZ/Fleet.htm |title=Air New Zealand Space+ seat |accessdate=20 January 2012}}</ref>

On 28 June 2004, Air New Zealand released details of the upgrade to its long-haul product, which was aimed to turn around the profitability of its international services. Every seat on its Boeing 747 aircraft was equipped with a personal LCD screen with [[audio video on demand]] (AVOD). First class was removed, with an upgraded business class and a new premium economy section installed.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In January 2010, Air New Zealand released details of its new "Kupe" long-haul product for its new 777-300ER aircraft which arrived later that year, as well as on its 787-9 aircraft. Changes included an improved Business Premier and Economy class product, a new Premium Economy cabin, and the introduction of the Economy SkyCouch.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

====Business Premier====
Business Premier is the highest available class on Air New Zealand flights, available on both 777 variants and the 787 aircraft. The seating is configured in a [[Herringbone seating|herringbone layout]] in a 1-2-1 configuration on the 777s and 1-1-1 on the 787, allowing direct access for every passenger to an aisle. Each seat is {{convert|22|in}} wide leather and comes with an [[ottoman (furniture)|ottoman]] footrest that doubles as a visitor seat. The seat converts to a full-length ({{convert|79.5|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) lie-flat bed.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

====Premium Economy====
Premium Economy is in a dedicated cabin, which shares lavatories with the Business Premier cabin, available on the Boeing 777-200ER, Boeing 787-9, and some Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. The class has the same mood lighting, dining and wine selection and in-seat power as the Business Premier cabin. The newly refurbished seats are wider with a 9-inch recline and extendable leg rests with a 2-4-2 configuration on the 777 variants, and a 2-3-2 configuration on the 787-9. Seat pitch is approximately {{convert|41|in|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

====Economy====
[[File:Air New Zealand Pacific Economy 777-300ER cabin.jpg|thumb|Economy on 777-300ER]]
Economy class is available on all aircraft, in a 3-3-3 configuration on the 787, and a 3-4-3 configuration on the 777-200ER and the 777-300ER aircraft. The seats have a pitch of {{convert|31|to|34|in}}, have a 6-inch recline, and have a flexible edge seat base to provide more leg support when reclined. Each seat has its own AVOD entertainment system, with a 9-inch screen on the 787 and 777-200ER, and a 10.6-inch touchscreen on the 777-300ER.

====Economy SkyCouch====
The Economy SkyCouch is available on the 787-9, 777-200ER and 777-300ER. It is a set of three Economy class seats on the window rows of the cabin that have armrests that retract into the seat back, and full leg rests that individually and manually can be raised to horizontal to form a flat surface extending to the back of the seats in front. It is largely designed for families for use as a flat play surface, and for couples, who on purchasing the middle seat for 25% more each, can use it as a flat sleeping surface.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/economy-skycouch |title= Economy SkyCouch&nbsp;– Air New Zealand |accessdate=12 November 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205222649/http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/economy-skycouch| archive-date= 5 December 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.futuretakingflight.com/#/skycouch-seat-features |title= Seat features&nbsp;– Economy SkyCouch&nbsp;– Air New Zealand: Future Taking Flight |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref> Each SkyCouch seat is equipped with the same basic facilities as a standard Economy seat. The Skycouch is only available on routes longer than 6 hours duration; where the aircraft are used on shorter routes, the leg rests are locked out and the Skycouch seats act as regular economy seats.

The SkyCouch has earned the nickname "cuddle class" by media reporting on the innovative seating, from the ability for couples to curl up and "cuddle" together on the {{convert|74|x|155|cm|in|abbr=on}} flat surface.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&objectid=10622478|title= Welcome to cuddle class|work= The New Zealand Herald |date= 27 January 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2010 |first=Maria |last=Slade}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/passengers-prepare-for-cuddle-class/story-e6frfq80-1225936950816 |title= Airlines to introduce 'cuddle class' |work= news.com.au |date= 11 October 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101020054010/http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/passengers-prepare-for-cuddle-class/story-e6frfq80-1225936950816| archive-date= 20 October 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Concerns were raised almost immediately over the couch potentially being a new way to join the [[mile high club]]. Air New Zealand responded that public displays of affection of that level would not be tolerated in its aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.oneindia.in/2010/02/01/airnew-zealands-cuddle-class-raises-mile-highconcerns.html |title= Air New Zealand's 'cuddle class' raises 'mile high' concerns |work= One India News |date= 1 February 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref> The airline even released a billboard advertisement entitled "The Economy SkyCouch activity guide", suggesting "spoons" (hugs) were allowed, but "forks" (sexual activity) were not.<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/AirNewZealand#!/photo.php?fbid=386573590776&set=a.216147425776.141705.23637220776 The Economy SkyCouch Activity Guide] at Air New Zealand's official [[Facebook]] page.

====In-flight entertainment and magazine====

[[File:Air New Zealand Premium Economy Galley bar view.jpg|thumb|777-300ER bar-style galley with ''KiaOra'' screen and tasting area]]
Air New Zealand offers [[audio video on demand]] in all classes on international services on its aircraft. The AVOD system, branded ''KiaOra'', features multiple channels of video, audio, music, and games. Passengers can start and stop programs, plus rewind and fast-forward as desired. It is a ''gate-to-gate'' [[in-flight entertainment]] experience: passengers can start their entertainment as soon as they board the aircraft, and continue until they arrive at the gate of their destination, maximising play time, which is especially useful for its short-haul Tasman and Pacific Island flights. ''Gate-to-gate'' in-flight entertainment is not available on certain seats in economy (such as the bulkhead and emergency exit row seats).

AVOD screen size varies:<ref>{{cite web|title=In-flight Entertainment| publisher=Air New Zealand| url=http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/inflight-entertainment}}</ref>
* Business Premier: {{convert|10.4|in|abbr=on}}
* Premium Economy: {{convert|8.4|in|abbr=on}}
* Economy: {{convert|8.4|in|abbr=on}}

''KiaOra'', the airline's in-flight magazine, was removed from international flights from March 2009. It is now only in seat backs on domestic and trans-Tasman services, however it can still be found in the inflight magazine racks on international flights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airreview.com/AirNZ/IFE.htm |title=Air New Zealand Inflight magazine |accessdate=20 January 2012}}</ref> As a guide on international services, there is now a brief publication named ''Entertainment Magazine'' detailing the entertainment available on the flight, which also contains the buy on board 'in-Bites' menu.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airreview.com/AirNZ/Food.htm |title=Air New Zealand Inflight food menu |accessdate=20 January 2012}}</ref>

==Services==

===Air New Zealand Lounge===
[[File:Air New Zealand Koru Club Wellington1.jpg|thumb|Air New Zealand Koru Lounge in Wellington]]
[[File:Air New Zealand self check-in centre, Wellington Airport.jpg|thumb|Air New Zealand self check-in kiosks, Wellington]]
The Air New Zealand Lounge is the name for Air New Zealand's network of [[airline lounge]]s around the world. Members of Air New Zealand Koru programme may access the lounges, and also get valet parking, priority wait listing, exclusive check-in, extra checked in baggage and preferred seating.

===Airpoints===
Airpoints is Air New Zealand's [[frequent-flyer program]]me. Members earn Airpoints Dollars, which they can redeem at face value on any fare on Air New Zealand ticketed and operated flights. Members can attain status tiers, with increasing privileges ranging from Silver to Gold, then Gold Elite, by accumulating their Status Points, which are earned separately from Airpoints Dollars. Airpoints Gold and Airpoints Gold Elite have the same recognition as [[Star Alliance]] Gold status and benefits across the Star Alliance network. Airpoints Silver status is equivalent to Star Alliance Silver.

Airpoints members receive Status Points for almost every Air New Zealand flight, as well as many other flights with its Star Alliance partners. Status Points enable members to reach a higher status faster. Status Points will still be granted even on discount fares (such as Smart Saver and grabaseat fares) that normally do not earn Airpoints Dollars.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/airpoints/status_points/default.htm | title = Air NZ Status Points | year = 2009 | publisher = Air New Zealand | access-date = 24 August 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090210023718/http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/airpoints/status_points/default.htm | archive-date = 10 February 2009 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Outsourcing maintenance===
On 19 October 2005, Air New Zealand proposed outsourcing most of its heavy maintenance on its long-haul aircraft and engines, which would result in about 600 job losses, mostly in Auckland. Air New Zealand said that there were larger maintenance providers that could provide maintenance work more cheaply due to their large scale. The proposal was estimated to save $100 million over five years and came after many attempts to attract contracts to service other airlines' longhaul aircraft.

Eventually, a union proposal to save some of the remaining jobs was accepted. The proposal included shift and pay changes (most of them pay cuts) which would allow about 300 engineers in Auckland to keep their jobs. 200 were made redundant or resigned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10369829|title=Air NZ engineers accept deal|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=24 February 2006}}</ref>

===Minor seating policy===
{{Main|Airline sex discrimination policy controversy}}
In November 2005, it was revealed that Air New Zealand (along with Qantas and [[British Airways]]) had a policy of not seating adult male passengers next to unaccompanied children. The policy came to light following an incident in 2004 when a man who was seated next to a young boy on a Qantas flight in New Zealand was asked to change seats with a female passenger. A steward informed him that "it was the airline's policy that only women were allowed to sit next to unaccompanied children". Air New Zealand later said it had a similar policy to Qantas.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Airline Bars Men From Lone Children| publisher=peterellis.org.nz| date=29 November 2009| url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/MoralPanic/Airline/2005-1129_NewstalkZB_AirlineBars.htm| accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last= Thomson| first=Ainsley| title=Ban on men sitting next to children |work=The New Zealand Herald | date=29 November 2005| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10357510| accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref>

===Qantas code-share===
On 12 April 2006, Air New Zealand and Qantas announced that they had signed a code-share agreement for their trans-Tasman routes and would file for authorisation from the [[New Zealand Ministry of Transport]]<ref>[http://www.transport.govt.nz/international-air-carriage-competition/ International air carriage competition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429170219/http://www.transport.govt.nz/international-air-carriage-competition/ |date=29 April 2008 }}</ref> and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/744922/fromItemId/278039 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508202530/http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/744922/fromItemId/278039 |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 May 2007 |title=Qantas Airways Ltd & Air New Zealand Ltd&nbsp;– Authorisations |publisher=Accc.gov.au |accessdate=30 June 2013 }}</ref> The airlines maintained that they were making losses on Tasman routes due to too many empty seats, and that a codeshare would return the routes to profitability. Critics, particularly [[Wellington International Airport]], [[Christchurch Airport]] and [[Melbourne Airport]], argued that the codeshare flights would lead to reduced passenger choice and higher airfares, and that cities such as Auckland and [[Sydney]] would benefit immensely through economic activity services would bring.

On 15 November 2006 Air New Zealand announced it was withdrawing its application after a draft decision by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] to not approve the code-sharing agreement.

On 31 May 2018 Qantas and Air New Zealand announced that "seamless air travel" would be available to their customers through a new code-sharing agreement. The code-share took effect in October 2018.<ref>{{cite web |last=QANTAS |title=Announced: From October 2018 Qantas customers will enjoy seamless travel in New Zealand through our new @FlyAirNZ domestic codeshare agreement |url=https://twitter.com/Qantas/status/1002348976396357632 |website=Twitter |accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>

==Alternative propulsion==
In a 2008 effort to develop an [[aviation biofuel]], Air New Zealand and Boeing researched the [[jatropha]] plant to see if it was a viable green alternative to conventional fuel.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Air NZ sees biofuel salvation in jatropha| website=Carbonpositive.net| date=6 June 2008| url=http://www.carbonpositive.net/viewarticle.aspx?articleID=1114| accessdate=31 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211115803/http://www.carbonpositive.net/viewarticle.aspx?articleID=1114|archive-date=11 December 2008}}</ref> A two-hour test flight, using a 50-50 mixture of the new biofuel with [[Jet fuel|Jet A-1]] feeding a Rolls Royce RB-211 engine of one of the airline's 747-400s, was completed on 30 December 2008. The engine was then removed to be scrutinised and studied to identify any differences between the jatropha blend and regular Jet A1. No effects to performances were found. The use of jatropha has been identified as a possible future fuel but large tracts of low quality land needed to grow the plant would have to be found without impeding other agricultural uses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7805499.stm|title=Vegetable oil tested on NZ flight |date=31 December 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=31 December 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081231091937/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7805499.stm| archive-date= 31 December 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>
