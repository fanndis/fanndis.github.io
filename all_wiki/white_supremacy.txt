{{short description|Racist belief in the superiority of white people}}{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''White supremacy''' is the belief that [[white people]] are superior to those of other [[Race (human classification)|races]] and thus should dominate them. Its purpose is the maintenance and defense of a system of wealth, power, and privilege.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Martinez|first=Elizabeth|title=What is white supremacy?|url=http://www.pym.org/annual-sessions/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/06/What_Is_White_Supremacy_Martinez.pdf|access-date=November 11, 2020|website=pym.org}}</ref> White supremacy has roots in the now-discredited doctrine of [[scientific racism]], and was a key justification for [[colonialism]]. It underlies a spectrum of contemporary movements including [[Neo-Confederate|neo-Confederates]], [[neo-Nazism]] and [[Christian Identity]].

Different forms of white supremacy put forth different conceptions of who is considered white (though the exemplar is generally light-skinned, blond-haired, and blue-eyed, or [[Aryan race|'Aryan']] traits most common in northern Europe), and groups of white supremacists identify various racial and ethnic  enemies, most commonly those of [[African diaspora|African ancestry]], [[Indigenous peoples]] of the Americas and Australia, and [[Jews]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Flint|first=Colin|title=Spaces of Hate: Geographies of Discrimination and Intolerance in the U.S.A.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0-415-93586-9|page=53|quote=Although white racist activists must adopt a political identity of whiteness, the flimsy definition of whiteness in modern culture poses special challenges for them. In both mainstream and white supremacist discourse, to be white is to be distinct from those marked as non-white, yet the placement of the distinguishing line has varied significantly in different times and places.}}</ref>

As a [[political ideology]], it imposes and maintains [[Color line (racism)|social]], [[Racial segregation|political]], [[historical revisionism|historical]], or [[institutional racism|institutional]] domination by white people. This ideology has been put into effect through socioeconomic and legal structures such as the [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[Jim Crow laws]] in the [[United States]], the [[White Australia]] policies from the 1890s to the mid-1970s, and ''[[apartheid]]'' in [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America |url=https://archive.org/details/privilegereveale00wild |url-access=registration |last=Wildman |first=Stephanie M. |year=1996 |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=978-0-8147-9303-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/privilegereveale00wild/page/87 87]}}</ref><ref name="Helms 2016 6–7">{{Cite journal|last=Helms|first=Janet|date=2016|title=An election to save White Heterosexual Male Privilege|journal=Latina/o Psychology Today|volume=3|pages=6–7}}</ref> In addition, this ideology is embodied in the "White power" social movement. Since the early 1980s, the White power movement has been committed to overthrowing the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] and establishing a white homeland using paramilitary tactics. 

In academic usage, particularly in [[critical race theory]] or [[intersectionality]], "white supremacy" can also refer to a social system in which white people enjoy structural advantages ([[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]]) over other ethnic groups, on both a collective and individual level, despite formal legal equality.

==History==
White supremacy has ideological foundations that date back to 17th-century [[scientific racism]], the predominant paradigm of human variation that helped shape international relations and racial policy from the latter part of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] until the late 20th century (marked by decolonization and the abolition of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]] in 1991, followed by that country's [[South African general election, 1994|first multiracial elections in 1994]]).

On July 23, 2019, [[Christopher A.

With the emergence of [[Twitter]] in 2006, and platforms such as ''[[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]'' which was launched in 1996, an [[alt-right]] portal for white supremacists with similar beliefs, both adults and children, was provided in which they were given a way to connect.

[[Apartheid]] was introduced as an officially structured policy by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] after the [[South African general election, 1948|general election of 1948]].

===Germany===
[[Nazism]] promoted the idea of a superior [[Germanic people]] or [[Aryan race]] in [[Germany]] during the early 20th century. Notions of white supremacy and Aryan racial superiority were combined in the 19th century, with white supremacists maintaining the belief that white people were members of an Aryan "[[master race]]" which was superior to other races, particularly the [[Jews]], who were described as the "Semitic race", [[Slavs]], and [[Names of the Romani people|Gypsies]], which they associated with "cultural sterility". [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the [[Ancien Régime|''ancien régime'']] in France on racial degeneracy caused by racial intermixing, which he argued had destroyed the "purity" of the Nordic or Germanic race. Gobineau's theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany, emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable polarity between Aryan or Germanic peoples and Jewish culture.<ref>Blamires, Cyprian; Jackson, Paul.

==Academic use of the term==
The term ''white supremacy'' is used in some academic studies of racial power to denote a system of structural or [[societal racism]] which privileges white people over others, regardless of the presence or the absence of racial hatred. White racial advantages occur at both a collective and an individual level (''[[ceteris paribus]]'', {{Nowrap|i. e.}}, when individuals are compared that do not relevantly differ except in ethnicity). Legal scholar Frances Lee Ansley explains this definition as follows:

{{quote|By "white supremacy" I do not mean to allude only to the self-conscious racism of white supremacist [[hate group]]s. I refer instead to a political, economic and cultural system in which whites overwhelmingly control power and material resources, conscious and unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread, and relations of white dominance and non-white subordination are daily reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social settings.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ansley|first=Frances Lee|title=Stirring the Ashes: Race, Class and the Future of Civil Rights Scholarship|journal=Cornell Law Review|year=1989|volume=74|pages=993ff}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editor1 = Richard Delgado |editor2= Jean Stefancic | last = Ansley | first = Frances Lee | title = Critical white studies: Looking behind the mirror | chapter = White supremacy (and what we should do about it) | date = 1997-06-29 | page = 592}}</ref>}}

Some [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] educators, such as Betita Martinez and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop, also use the term in this way. The term expresses historic continuities between a pre–[[civil rights movement]] era of open white supremacy and the current racial power structure of the United States.

The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] attributed cultural primacy to the white race:

{{quote|The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the [[Brahman]]s, the [[Inca Empire|Incas]], and the rulers of the [[Polynesia|South Sea Islands]]. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | author-link = Arthur Schopenhauer | title = ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' | year = 1851 | pages = Vol. 2, Section 92| title-link = Parerga and Paralipomena }}</ref>}}

Many white supremacist groups are based on the concept of preserving genetic purity, and do not focus solely on [[discrimination]] based on skin color.<ref name="law.jrank.org">{{citation|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/11302/White-Supremacy-Groups.html |title=White Supremacy Groups |work=Law Library - American Law and Legal Information |publisher=Net Industries and its Licensors|date=2019| access-date=15 October 2019}}</ref> The KKK's reasons for supporting [[racial segregation]] are not primarily based on religious ideals, but some Klan groups are openly [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The KKK and other white supremacist groups like [[Aryan Nations]], [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]] and the [[White Patriot Party]] are considered [[Antisemitism in the United States|antisemitic]].<ref name="law.jrank.org"/>

[[Nazi Germany]] promulgated white supremacy based on the belief that the [[Aryan race]], or the Germans, were the ''[[master race]]''. It was combined with a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programme]] that aimed for [[racial hygiene]] through compulsory sterilization of sick individuals and extermination of [[Untermensch]]en ("subhumans"): [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|Slavs]], [[Jews]] and [[antiziganism|Romani]], which eventually culminated in [[the Holocaust]].<ref>Gumkowski, Janusz; Leszczynski, Kazimierz; Robert, Edward (translator) (1961).

[[Christian Identity]] is another movement closely tied to white supremacy. Some white supremacists identify themselves as [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Odinists]], although many Odinists reject white supremacy. Some white supremacist groups, such as the [[South Africa]]n [[Boeremag]], conflate elements of [[Christianity]] and Odinism.

Hale]], founder of the World Church of the Creator, has published articles stating that all races other than white are "mud races", which is what the group's religion teaches.<ref name="law.jrank.org"/>

The white supremacist ideology has become associated with a racist faction of the [[skinhead]] [[subculture]], despite the fact that when the skinhead culture first developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s, it was heavily influenced by black fashions and [[Black music|music]], especially Jamaican [[reggae]] and [[ska]], and African American [[soul music]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ska.about.com/musicperform/ska/library/1999/aa081699a.htm |title=Smiling Smash: An Interview with Cathal Smyth, a.k.a.

White supremacist recruitment activities are primarily conducted at a [[grassroots]] level as well as on the [[Internet]].

=== White separatism ===
{{anchor|White separatism}}
White [[separatism]] is a political and social movement that seeks the separation of [[white people]] from people of other [[race (human categorization)|races]] and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]], the establishment of a [[white ethnostate]] by removing non-whites from existing communities or by forming new communities elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_200607/ai_n16855771/pg_9/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203033702/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_200607/ai_n16855771/pg_9 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-12-03 |title=The Strategy of White Separatism |journal=Journal of Political and Military Sociology |date=Summer 2006 |last1=Dobratz |first1=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2=Stephanie L. |name-list-style=amp|volume=34 |number=1 |pages=49–80 }}</ref>

Most modern researchers do not view white separatism as distinct from white supremacist beliefs. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] defines white separatism as "a form of white supremacy";<ref name="ADL">{{cite web |title=White Separatism |url=https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/white-separatism |publisher=ADL}}</ref> the Southern Poverty Law Center defines both white nationalism and white separatism as "ideologies based on white supremacy."<ref name="SPLC">{{cite web |title=SPLC reacts to Facebook policy on white nationalism |url=https://www.splcenter.org/news/2019/03/27/splc-reacts-facebook-policy-white-nationalism |publisher=SPLC}}</ref> Facebook has banned content that is openly [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] or white separatist because "white nationalism and white separatism cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups".<ref name="Facebook">{{cite web |title=Standing Against Hate |url=https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/standing-against-hate/ |publisher=Facebook}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Facebook to ban white nationalism and separatism |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47728471 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

Use of the term to self-identify has been criticized as a dishonest rhetorical ploy. The Anti-Defamation League argues that white supremacists use the phrase because they believe it has fewer negative connotations than the term ''white supremacist''.<ref name="ADL_def">{{cite web |title=ADL: White Separatism |url=https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/white-separatism |website=adl.org |publisher=The Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref>

Dobratz & Shanks-Meile reported that adherents usually reject [[Interracial marriage|marriage "outside the white race"]]. They argued the existence of "a distinction between the white supremacist's desire to dominate (as in [[apartheid]], [[slavery]], or [[Racial segregation|segregation]]) and complete separation by race".<ref>Dobratz, Betty A. & Shanks-Meile, Stephanie L. (2000) ''The White Separatist Movement in the United States: "White Power, White Pride!''. Baltimore: JHU Press. pp.vii, 10</ref> They argued that this is a matter of pragmatism, that while many white supremacists are also white separatists, contemporary white separatists reject the view that returning to a system of segregation is possible or desirable in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Dobratz |first1=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2=Stephanie L. |name-list-style=amp|year=1997 |title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: White Power, White Pride! |location=New York |publisher=Twayne Publishers |isbn=9780805738650 |oclc=37341476 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r59bGyH4lOAC|pages=ix,12}}</ref>

'''The Klu Klux Klan and Nazism'''

Hitler greatly admired the stringent [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] and miscegenation laws in a number of U.S. states, mostly in the [[Southern United States|South]]. He greatly approved of the colonial and then American genocide of American Indians. He was inspired by the American approach to race during his lifetime. He praised it in “[[Mein Kampf]].” The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] sent a legal scholar to America to study segregated states’ race laws and used them as guidelines in developing the Nazi “blood laws” instituted in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] in 1936. And Germany actively encouraged its citizens to follow the example of the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] and other American white supremacists in vigilante violence against Jews and others the Nazis designated as of inferior race. [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, when Germans killed as many as 400 Jews around Germany and destroyed Jewish homes, businesses, and synagogues, was instigated by a speech by [[Joseph Goebbels]], Hitler’s [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|propaganda minister]]. Then the Nazis used the violence as an excuse to round up Jews, pack them into ghettoes, and give their homes, businesses, and valuables to non-Jews.

There is a great deal of overlap between the modern KKK and [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]]. [[David Duke]], who was [[Grand Wizard]] of a major Klan organization, was a member of the [[American Nazi Party]], and frequently appeared in a [[Uniforms of the German Army (1935–1945)|Nazi uniform]]. He had cosmetic surgery to make himself looke more [[Aryan race|Aryan]]. In the 1980s, in a bid to enter mainstream politics, he dropped his official association with the Klan and put the Nazi uniform in mothballs. But he continued his extreme [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] and [[Racism in the United States|anti-blacks]] politics and got nowhere as a Democrat. He switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and won a seat in the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]], where he had no impact. His [[Extremism|extremist]] activities got him convicted of a [[felony]]. When he ran for [[List of governors of Louisiana|Louisiana governor]] as a Republican in the 1990s, Louisians elected a notoriously corrupt Democrat instead. A bumper sticker said, “Do the right thing. Vote for the crook.” After washing out in mainstream politics, Duke returned to the neo-Nazi fold. He claimed that the "neo-Nazi vote" was what made [[Donald Trump|Trump]] president.

But there are several KKK organizations. Some Klan members and chapters pointedly separate themselves from Nazis because so many Americans fought the Nazis in [[World War II]], downplaying the anti-Semitism that long has been part of the Klan creed and focusing on anti-black and segregationist activities. Other Klanspeople embrace jumbled-up hate and claim it’s Christian virtue. The Ku Klux Klan have also made use of nazi retoric and [[Nazi symbolism|nazi symbols]].

== Political violence ==
The [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]] has estimated that 3,446 blacks were the victims of [[lynchings in the United States]] between 1882 and 1968, with the peak occurring in the 1890s at a time of economic stress in the South and increasing political suppression of blacks. If 1,297 whites were also lynched during this period, blacks were disproportionally targeted, representing 72.7% of all people lynched.<ref name="tuskegee_umkc">{{cite web|title=Lynchings: By State and Race, 1882–1968|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629081241/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html|archive-date=2010-06-29|accessdate=2010-07-26|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|quote=Statistics provided by the Archives at Tuskegee Institute.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=History of Lynchings|url=https://www.naacp.org/history-of-lynchings/|access-date=2020-07-01|website=NAACP|language=en}}</ref> According to scholar Amy L.
