==Names==
The city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city; among them there is the name '''Jiangning''' or '''Kiangning''' ({{lang|zh-hant|江寧}}), whose former character Jiang ({{lang|zh|江}}, Yangtze) is the former part of the name [[Jiangsu]] and latter character '''Ning''' ({{lang|zh-hant|寧}}, simplified form {{zh|labels=no |s=宁 |l=Peace}}) is the short name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of China, for instance under the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|ROC]], Jing ({{zh|labels=no |c=京 |l=Capital}}) was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.

The city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]]. The name '''Nanjing''', which means "Southern Capital", was officially designated for the city during the [[Ming dynasty]], about six hundred years later.{{efn|Since becoming a southern capital, the city has been called Nanking (Nanjing, {{lang|zh|南京}}) unofficially, and was officially named Nanjing (Nanking) after Peking (Beijing {{lang|zh|北京}}, renamed from Peping or Beiping, {{lang|zh|北平}}) became a capital city during the early [[Ming dynasty]]; the name appears in Ming dynasty echo poem ({{lang|zh-hant|蕭子顯 《奉和昭明太子鐘山講解詩》："崇嶽基舊宇，盤嶺跨南京"}}), for example. It's also unofficially called Nandu ({{lang|zh|南都}}), and Nandu Fanhui Tu ({{zh|labels=no |t=《南都繁會圖》 |l=Nandu Prosperity Picture}}) is an example.}} Nanjing is sometimes known as '''Jinling''' or '''Ginling''' ({{lang|zh-hant|金陵}}, "Gold Hill") of the eponymous [[Ginling College]]; the old name has been used since the [[Warring States period]] in the [[Zhou dynasty]].<ref>Nanjing is also called Jincheng ({{lang|zh|金城}}, Golden City), derived from Jinling City. In addition, Jincheng was a city in Nanjing area. In the 1st year of Hsiankang in the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] ({{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}335), Langya ({{lang|zh|瑯琊}}), a prefectural governor [[Huan Wen]] stationed in Jincheng, submitted a proposal to establish the prefecture of South Langya in the land of Jiangsheng ({{lang|zh|江乘}}) county, and then the city Jincheng became the capital city of the newly established South Langya Prefecture ({{lang|zh|南瑯琊郡}}). The Jincheng later renamed Jinling township, in today's [[Qinhuai District]]. ({{lang|zh-hant|《至大金陵新志》："金城在城东二十五里，吴筑，今上元县金陵乡地名金城戍即其地。" 《至正金陵新志》："上元縣金陵鄉，舊名金城戍。晉太元八年，謝安勞師于金城，即此。或稱琅邪城。咸康初，桓溫為琅邪內史，鎮金城。"}})</ref> In English, the spelling '''Nanking''' has been traditional until [[Pinyin]], developed in the 1950s and internationally adopted in the 1980s, standardized the spelling as "Nanjing".

===Early history and foundation===

Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to [[Li Zicheng]]'s rebel forces and then to the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince [[Zhu Yousong, Prince of Fu|Zhu Yousong]] was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor.<ref name="Wakeman 346">{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=346}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=644}}.</ref> His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called [[Southern Ming dynasty]].<ref>{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=642}}. The prince was a grandson of the [[Wanli Emperor]] (r. 1573–1620). The Wanli Emperor's attempt to name Zhu Yousong's father as heir apparent had been thwarted by supporters of the [[Donglin movement]] because Zhu Yousong's father was not the Wanli Emperor's eldest son. Although this was three generations earlier, Donglin officials in Nanjing nonetheless feared that the prince might retaliate against them.</ref>

Zhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier.

Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, [[Koxinga]] announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father succsfully did against the Dutch at the [[Battle of Liaoluo Bay]], throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Ho |first=Dahpon David |year=2011 |title=Sealords live in vain : Fujian and the making of a maritime frontier in seventeenth-century China |type=A dissertation submitted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy in History |publisher=UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO |pages=149–150 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3pk3t096 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404092359/https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3pk3t096 |archive-date=2019-04-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won.

The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do.

=== Qing dynasty and Taiping Rebellion ===
[[File:Nanjing-Mochouhu.jpg|thumb|1.1|[[Mochou Lake]]]]
Under the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911), the Nanjing area was known as '''Jiangning''' and served as the seat of government for the [[Viceroy of Liangjiang]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://njdfz.nje.cn/UpLoadFile/html/%E5%B8%82%E5%BF%971-4%E5%86%8C/html/ANoame093.html |script-chapter=zh:清督驻所太平天国定鼎 |script-title=zh:南京市志（第1册） }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It was the site of a [[Qing Army]] garrison.<ref>{{citation |last=Cassel |first=Pär |contribution=Excavating Extraterritoriality: The "Judicial Sub-Prefect" as a Prototype for the Mixed Court in Shanghai |title=Late Imperial China |volume=24 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=156–182 }}.</ref> It had been visited by the [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]] and [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong]] emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces. Nanjing was threatened to be invaded by British troops during the close of the [[First Opium War]], which was ended by the [[Treaty of Nanking]] in 1842. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as '''Tianjing''' ({{zh|labels=no |c=天京 |l="Heavenly Capital" or "Capital of Heaven"}}). The rebellion destroyed most of the former Ming imperial buildings in the city, including the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]].

Both the Qing viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the [[Presidential Building (Nanjing)|Presidential Palace]]. When Qing forces led by [[Zeng Guofan]] retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death.<ref>"[http://necrometrics.com/wars19c.htm#Taiping Necrometrics] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20150430180518/http://necrometrics.com/wars19c.htm%23Venez1859#Taiping |date=2015-04-30 }}."

The New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil Hart arrived in Nanking in 1881. After some time, he eventually thwarted its officials by buying a piece of property near the South Gate and Confucius Temple; to build the city's first Methodist Church, western hospital (Blackstone Methodist Hospital) and Boys' School. The hospital would later be unified with the Drum Tower Hospital and the Boys' School would be expanded by later Missionaries to become the [[University of Nanking]] and Medical School. The old Mission property would become the No. 13 Middle School, the city's oldest/continuous school grounds in the city.<ref>"Man on a Mission" by Stanley Crawford</ref>

=== Capital of the republic and Nanking Massacre ===
{{see also|Battle of Nanking|Nanking Massacre}}
[[File:National Government of the R.O.C.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Presidential Building (Nanjing)|Presidential Palace]] of the National Government of the Republic of China in Nanjing, 1927]]
The [[Xinhai Revolution]] led to the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] in January 1912 with [[Sun Yat-sen]] as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked [[Yuan Shikai]] to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of [[Puyi]], the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).

In 1927, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the [[Nanking decade]]. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|grand mausoleum]] to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of [[Zhejiang]] and the general area had strong popular support for him.
[[File:Crossing river by Gate of China01.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese soldiers entering the walled city of Nanjing through the [[Gate of China, Nanjing|Gate of China]]]]
In 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan ({{lang|zh-Hant|首都計劃}}), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.

In 1937, the [[Empire of Japan]] started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (often considered a theater of [[World War II]]).<ref>Fu Jing-hui, An Introduction of Chinese and Foreign History of War, 2003, p.109–111</ref> Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal [[Nanking massacre]] (the "Rape of Nanking").<ref name="ReferenceA">[[John E.

National Archives, Washington, D.C., Released in Sept. 1994.)</ref> The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The [[Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall]] was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.

A few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city [[Chongqing|Chungking (Chongqing)]] and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the "[[Wang Jingwei Government|Nanjing Regime]]" or "Reorganized National Government of China" led by [[Wang Jingwei]] was established in Nanjing as a rival to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s government in Chongqing.<ref>{{cite book|title=Imperial Japan and national identities in Asia, 1895–1945 |year=2003 |first1=Li |first2=R.B. |last1=Narangoa |last2=Cribb |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-7007-1482-0 |page=13}}</ref> In 1946, after the [[Surrender of Japan]], the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.

=== Chinese Civil War and People's Republic ===
{{see also|Yangtze River Crossing Campaign}} 
On 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the [[Yangtze River]]. On April 23, the Communist [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) captured Nanjing.<ref name="Zhang">Zhang, Chunhou. Vaughan, C. Edwin. [2002] (2002). Mao Zedong as Poet and Revolutionary Leader: Social and Historical Perspectives. Lexington books. {{ISBN|0-7391-0406-3}}. p 65, p 58</ref> The KMT government retreated to Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) until October 15, [[Chongqing]] until November 25, and then [[Chengdu]] before retreating to the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] on December 10 where [[Taipei]] was proclaimed the [[temporary capital]] of the Republic of China. By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only [[Tibet (1912–51)|Tibet]] and [[Hainan Island]] were left. 
After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a [[province-level municipality]], but it was soon merged into [[Jiangsu]] and again became the provincial capital by replacing [[Zhenjiang]] which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.

[[File:Nanjing Area - Lower Yangtse Valley & Eastern China Map.jpg|thumb|Nanjing Region – Lower Yangtze Basin and Eastern China.]]

Nanjing, with a total land area of {{convert|6598|km2|abbr=on}}, is situated in the heartland of the [[drainage area]] of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is {{convert|650|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Luoyang]], {{convert|900|km|abbr=on}} south-southeast of Beijing, {{convert|270|km|abbr=on}} west-northwest of Shanghai, and {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} east-northeast of [[Chongqing]]. The Yangtze River flows downstream from [[Jiujiang]], Jiangxi, through [[Anhui]] and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the [[Huai River]] basin and the southern part is the [[Zhe River]] basin; they are connected by the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang ({{lang|zh|下江}}, Downstream River) region, with [[Jianghuai]] dominant in the northern part and [[Wu (region)|Jiangzhe]] dominant in the southern part.{{efn|Huai (Huai of Jianghuai {{lang|zh|江淮}}) is a big river north of Jiang (the river [[Yangtze]]), and the Zhe (Zhe of Jiangzhe {{lang|zh|江浙}})) is a big river south of Jiang.}} The region is also well known as Dongnan ({{lang|zh|东南}}, South East, the Southeast) and [[Jiangnan]] ({{lang|zh|江南}}, and River South, South of Yangtze).{{efn|The areas covered by such geographical names as Jiangnan, Dongnan and Xiajiang are not precisely defined. In ancient times the area was known as [[Yang Province|Yangchow]] ({{lang|zh-hant|揚州}}). Sometimes the term Jianghai ({{lang|zh|江海}}) is used because the region is where the Jiang ([[Yangtze]], river) empties into the Hai (sea).}}

Nanjing borders [[Yangzhou]] to the northeast (one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze); [[Zhenjiang]] to the east (one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze); and [[Changzhou]] to the southeast. On its western boundary is [[Anhui]], where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: [[Chuzhou]] to the northwest, [[Wuhu]], [[Chaohu]] and [[Ma'anshan]] to the west and [[Xuancheng]] to the southwest.<ref name="市志_市域">{{cite book |script-chapter=zh:中华人民共和国成立后中央直辖市及江苏省省会 |script-title=zh:南京市志（第1册）}}</ref>

Nanjing is at the intersection of the Yangtze River, an east–west water transport artery, and the Nanjing–Beijing railway, a north–south land transport artery, hence the name “door of the east and west, throat of the south and north”. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round the east side of the city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain crouches in the west of the city, hence the name “the Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching”.

Nanjing has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'') and is influenced by the East Asian [[monsoon]]. The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold<!--due to the high humidity and widespread lack of heating units-->, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with [[Chongqing]] and [[Wuhan]], Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the "[[Three Furnaces]]" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.gzkp.org.cn/show.aspx?id=180&cid=5|script-title = zh:为什么重庆、武汉、南京有“三大火炉”之称？|publisher = Guangzhou Popular Science News Net (广州科普资讯网)| language = zh-hans|date = 2007-09-12|access-date = 2014-11-12|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112042247/http://www.gzkp.org.cn/show.aspx?id=180&cid=5|archive-date = 2014-11-12}}</ref> However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the [[plum blossom]] blooming season in which the ''[[meiyu]]'' (rainy season of East Asia; literally "plum rain") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness.

The annual mean temperature is around {{convert|15.91|°C|1}}, with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from {{convert|2.7|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|28.1|°C|1}} in July.

With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37&nbsp;percent in March to 52&nbsp;percent in August, the city receives 1,926 hours of bright sunshine annually.

Nanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and [[sulfur]] reserves make up 40&nbsp;percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of [[strontium]] rank first in East Asia and the [[South East Asia]] region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in [[Jiangning District|Jiangning]] and Tangquan Hot Spring in [[Pukou]].

Sun Yat-sen once summarized and lauded the feature of Nanjing in his book ''The International Development of China'' ({{lang|zh-hant|建國方略}}):<blockquote>Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a vast level plain—a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the lower Yangtze.

Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 [[Deadweight tonnage|DWT]] vessels from the East China Sea.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moc.gov.cn/jiaotongyaowen/201607/t20160705_2056811.html |script-title=zh:十二点五米深水航道初通南京 长江出海口至南京全程畅行五万吨级船舶 |language=zh-hans |date=2016-07-05 |publisher=[[Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202014036/http://www.moc.gov.cn/jiaotongyaowen/201607/t20160705_2056811.html|archive-date=2017-02-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{Clear}}

===Earlier development===
[[File:Bílý ďábel v Pekingu 17.jpg|thumb|right|Qinhuai River in 1920s]]

There was a massive cultivating in the area of Nanjing from the Three Kingdoms period to Southern dynasties. The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules’ people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.

The craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing.<ref>{{lang|zh-hant|清乾隆、嘉慶年間，江寧織機在四萬台以上。清光緒十二年二月十六日《申報》："（南京）城廂內外緞機總數常五萬有奇，以此為生產者達二十萬人。"}}</ref> Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade ({{lang|zh-hans|南京云锦}}) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as [[dragon robe]]s. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called "tribute satins" ("{{lang|zh-hans|贡缎}}"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi ({{lang|zh-hans|网巾市}}, the market sells [[wangjin]]), Guyilang ({{lang|zh-hans|估衣廊}}, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao ({{lang|zh-hans|油坊桥}}, the bridge near an oil mill).

Moreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing. The Ming dynasty drawing ''Prosperous Nanjing'' ({{zh|labels=no|s=南都繁会图卷 |p=Nándū Fánhuì Tújuǎn}}) depicts a vivid market scene bustling with people and full of various sorts of shops. However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.

===Modern times===
[[File:Nanjing Xinjiekou Skyline.jpg|thumb|left|[[Xinjiekou, Nanjing]]]]
Into the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge [[department stores]] such as [[Zhongyang Shangchang]] sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the [[service industry]], .

In the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned [[heavy industry|heavy industries]], as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=综述|chapter-url=http://njdfz.nje.cn/UpLoadFile/html/%E5%B8%82%E5%BF%975-7/html/5Noname002.html |script-title=zh:南京市志（第5卷）·工业}}</ref> Overenthusiastic in building a “world-class” industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the [[Reform and Opening]] recovering market economy, the [[state-owned enterprises]] found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or [[privatization]] and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.

===Today===

The current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past. Service industries are dominating, accounting for about 60 percent of the GDP of the city, and financial industry, culture industry and tourism industry are top 3 of them. Industries of information technology, energy saving and environmental protection, new energy, smart power grid and intelligent equipment manufacturing have become pillar industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.js.xinhuanet.com/2016-01/01/c_1117643606.htm|script-title=zh:在结构调整中持续发展 南京2015年产值近万亿-新华网|agency=Xinhua News Agency|access-date=2016-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131063438/http://www.js.xinhuanet.com/2016-01/01/c_1117643606.htm|archive-date=2016-01-31|url-status=dead|title=Archived copy}}</ref> Big [[civilian-run enterprise]] include [[Suning Commerce Group|Suning Commerce]], [[Yurun]], [[Sanpower]], [[Fuzhong]], [[Hiteker]], [[5stars]], [[Jinpu]], [[Tiandi]], [[CTTQ Pharmaceutical]], [[Nanjing Iron and Steel Company]] and [[Simcere Pharmaceutical]].

Many China-based leading firms such as [[Huawei]], [[ZTE]] and [[Lenovo]] have key R&D institutes in the city. Nanjing is an industrial technology research and development hub, hosting many R&D centers and institutions, especially in areas of electronics technology, information technology, computer software, biotechnology and pharmaceutical technology and new material technology.

In recent years, Nanjing has been developing its economy, commerce, industry, as well as city construction. In 2013 the city's GDP was RMB 801&nbsp;billion (3rd in Jiangsu), and GDP per capita (current price) was RMB 98,174(US$16041), an 11&nbsp;percent increase from 2012.

===Yangtze River crossings===
{{main|Yangtze River bridges and tunnels}}
[[File:NJ 3rd Bridge-edit.jpg|thumb|Third Nanjing Yangtze Bridge]]
In the 1960s, the first [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]] was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600&nbsp;meters on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580&nbsp;meters spanning the river itself.  Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built.  Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: [[Dashengguan Yangtze River Bridge|Dashengguan Bridge]], [[Line 10, Nanjing Metro|Line 10 Metro Tunnel]], [[Third Nanjing Yangtze Bridge|Third Bridge]], [[Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|南京长江隧道}}), First Bridge, [[Second Nanjing Yangtze Bridge|Second Bridge]] and [[Fourth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge|Fourth Bridge]],Nanjing Yangtze Tunnel ({{lang|zh-Hans|南京扬子江隧道}}). In the near future, Such Yangtze Crossings will be added as follow :Jianning West Rd. Tunnel, Xianxin Rd. Tunnel, Heyan Rd. Tunnel, Fifth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge.

==Culture and art==
[[File:南京中国科举博物馆.jpg|thumb|[[Jiangnan Examination Hall]]]]
Being one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, the city was the official [[imperial examination]] center ([[Jiangnan Examination Hall]]) for the [[Jiangnan]] region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.

Today, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a "city of culture" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.

===Art===
[[File:Pekinguniversitykunqu4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kunqu]]]]
Some of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the [[Qianxian Dance Company]], [[Nanjing Dance Company]], [[Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute]] and [[Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company]] among others.

[[Jiangsu Province Kun Opera]] is one of the best theaters for [[Kunqu]], China's oldest stage art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.com.cn/chinese/zhuanti/153379.htm|title=A brief introduction to Jiangsu Province Kunqu Theater}}</ref>
It is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theater and puppet theater.

[[Jiangsu Art Gallery]] is the largest gallery in Jiangsu Province, presenting some of the best traditional and contemporary art pieces of China like the historical Master [[Ho-Kan]];<ref>[http://www.synotrip.com/nanjing/jiangsu-art-gallery Jiangsu Art Gallery] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517121938/http://www.synotrip.com/nanjing/jiangsu-art-gallery |date=2014-05-17 }}, [http://www.synotrip.com/ Synotrip] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625115459/http://www.synotrip.com/ |date=2014-06-25 }}.</ref> many other smaller-scale galleries, such as [[Red Chamber Art Garden]] and [[Jinling Stone Gallery]], also have their own special exhibitions.

===Festivals===
[[File:Nanjing Library 2016.7.16.jpg|thumb|[[Nanjing Library]]]]
Many traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in [[Qing Xi of Nanjing|Qing Xi]] on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in [[Chinese lunar calendar]]). Almost none of them, however, are still celebrated by modern Nanjingese.

Instead, Nanjing, as a tourist destination, hosts a series of government-organized events throughout the year. The annual [[International Plum Blossom Festival]] held in [[Plum Blossom Hill]], the largest [[Plum blossom|plum collection]] in China, attracts thousands of tourists both domestically and internationally. Other events include Nanjing Baima Peach Blossom and Kite Festival, [[Jiangxin Island|Jiangxin Zhou]] Fruit Festival and Linggu Temple Sweet Osmanthus Festival.

===Libraries===
[[Nanjing Library]], founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the [[National Library of China|National Library]] in Beijing and [[Shanghai Library]]. Other libraries, such as city-owned [[Jinling Library]] and various district libraries, also provide considerable amount of information to citizens. [[Nanjing University Library]] is the second largest university libraries in China after Peking University Library, and the fifth largest nationwide, especially in the number of precious collections.

The major theaters include the [[Nanjing People's Convention Hall|People's Convention Hall]] and the [[Nanjing Arts and Culture Center]]. The Capital Theater well known in the past is now a museum in theater/film.

===Night life===
[[File:Fuzimiaonight.JPG|thumb|Qinhuai River]]
Traditionally Nanjing's nightlife was mostly centered around [[Nanjing Fuzimiao]] (Confucius Temple) area along the [[Qinhuai River]], where night markets, restaurants and pubs thrived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2011-03/28/content_22239814_4.htm|title=Life on the Water's Edge: The Culture and History of the Qinhuai River – China.org.cn|website=china.org.cn|access-date=2014-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111020037/http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2011-03/28/content_22239814_4.htm|archive-date=2013-11-11|url-status=live}}</ref> Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.

In the past 20&nbsp;years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are<!--I've seen them. None could be called "mega".--> shopping malls opening late in the [[Xinjiekou, Nanjing|Xinjiekou]] CBD, as well as in and around major residential areas throughout the city. The well-established "[[Nanjing 1912]]" district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs, in both its downtown location and beside Baijia Lake in [[Jiangning District]]. In recent years, many night-life options have opened up in Catherine Park as well as in shopping malls such as IST in [[Xinjiekou, Nanjing|Xinjiekou]] and Kingmo near [[Baijiahu station|Baijai Lake metro station]]. Other, more student-oriented places are to be found near to [[Nanjing University]] and [[Nanjing Normal University]].

===Food and symbolism===

The local cuisine in Nanjing is called Jinling cuisine ({{lang|zh|金陵菜}}) or Jingsu cuisine ([[京苏菜]]); it is part of Jiangsu province's cuisine.  Jinling cuisine is famous for its meticulous process, emphasizing no added preservatives and its seasonality. Its duck and goose dishes are well known among Chinese for centuries.  It also employs many different style of cooking methods, such as slow cooking, Chinese oven cooking, etc. Its dishes tend to be light and fresh, suitable for all. The restaurant specializing in Jinling cuisine is Ma Xiang Xing ([[马祥兴菜馆]]).

Many of the city's local favorite dishes are based on ducks, including [[Nanjing salted duck]], [[duck blood and vermicelli soup]], and duck oil pancake.<ref>{{cite web|title=China Cultural Kaleidoscope|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/8K5061K11152.html|access-date=29 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129030906/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/8K5061K11152.html|archive-date=29 November 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing, which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China. According to Nanjing.GOV.cn, "There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb. In the spring, the radish tastes very juicy and sweet. It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish. And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish', which means they are unsophisticated, passionate and conservative. From health perspective, eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival".<ref>{{cite web|title=Frying Spring Rolls at the Beginning of Spring|url=http://english.nanjing.gov.cn/zx/shyw/201102/t20110222_319119.htm|access-date=19 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513010350/http://english.nanjing.gov.cn/zx/shyw/201102/t20110222_319119.htm|archive-date=13 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
