During an interview, Page recalled his childhood home "was usually a mess, with computers, science, and technology magazines and ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazines all over the place", an environment in which he immersed himself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-the-untold-story-2014-4|title=The Untold Story Of Larry Page's Incredible Comeback|first=Nicholas|last=Carlson|website=Business Insider}}</ref> Page was an avid reader during his youth, writing in his 2013 Google founders letter: "I remember spending a huge amount of time pouring [sic] over books and magazines".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Larry Page|title=2013 Founders' Letter|url=https://investor.google.com/corporate/2013/founders-letter.html|website=Google Investor Relations|accessdate=February 2, 2015|year=2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202215024/https://investor.google.com/corporate/2013/founders-letter.html|archive-date=February 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> According to writer Nicholas Carlson, the combined influence of Page's home atmosphere and his attentive parents "fostered creativity and invention". Page also played instruments and studied [[music composition]] while growing up. His parents sent him to music summer camp — [[Interlochen Arts Camp]] at Interlochen, Michigan, and Page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing. "In some sense, I feel like music training led to the high-speed legacy of Google for me". In an interview Page said that "In music, you're very cognizant of time. Time is like the primary thing" and that "If you think about it from a music point of view, if you're a percussionist, you hit something, it's got to happen in [[milliseconds]], fractions of a second".<ref name="Car"/>

Page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old, as he was able to "play with the stuff lying around"—first-generation personal computers—that had been left by his mother and father.<ref name="achievement.org"/> He became the "first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a [[word processor]]".<ref name=Scott/> His older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking "everything in his house apart to see how it worked". He said that "from a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. So I became interested in technology and business.

== PhD studies and research ==
After enrolling in a [[computer science]] PhD program at [[Stanford University]], Page was in search of a [[dissertation]] theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the [[World Wide Web]], understanding its link structure as a huge [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. His supervisor, [[Terry Winograd]], encouraged him to pursue the idea, and Page recalled in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received.<ref>{{cite web|title=The best advice I ever got|url=http://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/2.html|website=Fortune|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=April 30, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112043148/http://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/2.html|archive-date=January 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> He also considered doing research on [[telepresence]] and [[self-driving car]]s during this time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Faculty Summit 2009: Meet Google Founder Larry Page|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUNqsYUVPQY|website=GoogleTechTalks on YouTube|accessdate=February 2, 2015 |date=October 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311042501/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUNqsYUVPQY|archive-date=March 11, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="doi10.1016/S0169-75529800110-X">{{Cite journal|last1=Brin|first1=Sergey|author-link1=Sergey Brin|last2=Page|first2=Lawrence|author-link2=Larry Page|doi=10.1016/S0169-7552(98)00110-X|title=The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine|journal=Computer Networks and ISDN Systems|volume=30|issue=1|pages=107–117|location=[Amsterdam]|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers|date=April 1998 |issn=0169-7552|lccn=86641126|oclc=884480703 |url=https://cumincad.architexturez.net/system/files/pdf/2873.content.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brin|first1=Sergey|author-link1=Sergey Brin|last2=Page|author-link2=Larry Page|first2=Lawrence|title=Reprint of: The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine|journal=Computer Networks|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|publisher=Elsiver|date=December 17, 2012|volume=56|issue=18|pages=3825–3833|issn=1389-1286|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2012.10.007 |lccn=sn99047167|oclc=610365057 }}</ref><ref name="wiredbirth"/>

Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages linked to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page. The role of [[citation]]s in [[academic publishing]] would also become pertinent for the research.<ref name="wiredbirth">{{cite web|author1=John Battelle|title=The Birth of Google|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?tw=wn_tophead_4|website=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast Digital|accessdate=February 22, 2015|date=August 13, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107160749/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?tw=wn_tophead_4|archive-date=November 7, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Sergey Brin]], a fellow Stanford PhD student, would soon join Page's research project, nicknamed "[[BackRub]]."<ref name="wiredbirth"/> Together, the pair authored a research paper titled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale [[Hypertext]]ual Web Search Engine" , which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the Internet at the time.<ref name="achievement.org"/><ref name="doi10.1016/S0169-75529800110-X"/>

[[John Battelle]], co-founder of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, wrote that Page had reasoned that the:

<blockquote>... entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citation—after all, what is a link but a citation? If he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the Web, as Page puts it "the Web would become a more valuable place."<ref name="wiredbirth"/></blockquote>

Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the project:

<blockquote>At the time Page conceived of BackRub, the Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents, with an untold number of links between them. The computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project. Unaware of exactly what he was getting into, Page began building out his crawler. The idea's complexity and scale lured Brin to the job. A [[polymath]] who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic, he found the premise behind BackRub fascinating. "I talked to lots of research groups" around the school, Brin recalls, "and this was the most exciting project, both because it tackled the Web, which represents human knowledge, and because I liked Larry."<ref name=wiredbirth/></blockquote>

=== Search engine development ===
To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's [[web crawler]] into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a [[search engine]] far superior to existing ones.<ref name="wiredbirth"/> The algorithm relied on a new technology that analyzed the relevance of the [[backlink]]s that connected one web page to another.<ref name=" Moschovitis">Moschovitis Group. ''The Internet: A Historical Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2005.</ref>

Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the now nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network.<ref name="wiredbirth"/> After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.<ref name="economist.com">{{cite web|title=Enlightenment man|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12673407|website=The Economist|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=December 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123005321/http://www.economist.com/node/12673407|archive-date=January 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Page+brin by origa.jpg|thumb|Page and [[Sergey Brin]] by [[Graziano Origa]] ]]
Page and Brin used the former's basic [[HTML]] programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional [[server (computing)|server]]s to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.<ref name="wiredbirth"/>

Page and Brin's vision has been compared to that of [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the inventor of modern printing:<ref>[http://www.librarystuff.net/2009/10/01/google-the-gutenberg/ "Google the Gutenberg"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119215310/http://www.librarystuff.net/2009/10/01/google-the-gutenberg/ |date=January 19, 2015 }}. ''Information Technology''. October 1, 2009</ref>
<blockquote>In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts – originally replicated by hand – to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance ... Google has done a similar job.</blockquote>

The comparison was also noted by the authors of ''The Google Story'': "Not since Gutenberg ... has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed [[access to information]], as profoundly as Google."<ref name=Vise>[[Vise, David]], and [[Malseed, Mark]]. ''[[The Google Story]]'', Delta Publ. (2006)</ref> Also, not long after the two "cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web" such as digitizing books and expanding health information.<ref name="economist.com"/>

By June 2000, Google had indexed one billion Internet URLs ([[Uniform Resource Locators]]), making it the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time. The company cited [[NEC]] Research Institute data in its June 26 press release, stating that "there are more than 1 billion web pages online today", with Google "providing access to 560 million full-text indexed web pages and 500 million partially indexed URLs."<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Launches World's Largest Search Engine|url=http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2000/06/google-launches-worlds-largest-search.html|website=News From Google|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=June 26, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222030713/http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2000/06/google-launches-worlds-largest-search.html|archive-date=February 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Early management style ====
During his first tenure as CEO, Page embarked on an attempt to fire all of Google's project managers in 2001. Page's plan involved all of Google's engineers reporting to a VP of engineering, who would then report directly to him—Page explained that he didn't like non-engineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge.<ref name="Car"/> Page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference:
* Don't delegate: Do everything you can yourself to make things go faster.
* Don't get in the way if you're not adding value. Let the people doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else.
* Don't be a [[bureaucrat]].
* Ideas are more important than age. Just because someone is junior doesn't mean they don't deserve respect and cooperation.
* The worst thing you can do is stop someone from doing something by saying, "No. Period."  If you say no, you have to help them find a better way to get it done.<ref name="Car"/>

Even though Page's new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees, his issue with engineers being managed by non-engineering staff gained traction.<ref name=" Max"/> Page also believed that the faster Google's search engine returned answers, the more it would be used. He fretted over [[milliseconds]] and pushed his engineers—from those who developed [[algorithm]]s to those who built [[data center]]s—to think about [[lag|lag times]]. He also pushed for keeping Google's home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster.<ref name="fortune.com"/>

=== 2001–2011 ===
==== Changes in management and expansion ====
Before Silicon Valley's two most prominent investors, [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]], agreed to invest a combined total of $50 million in Google, they applied pressure on Page to step down as CEO so that a more experienced leader could build a "world-class management team." Page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology CEOs, including [[Steve Jobs]] and Intel's [[Andrew Grove]]. [[Eric Schmidt]], who had been hired as Chairman of Google in March 2001, left his full-time position as the CEO of [[Novell]] to take the same role at Google in August of the same year, and Page moved aside to assume the President of Products role.<ref name="Car"/>

Under Schmidt's leadership, Google underwent a period of major growth and expansion, which included its [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on August 20, 2004. He always acted in consultation with Page and Brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a [[sales force management system]]. Page remained the boss at Google in the eyes of the employees, as he gave final approval on all new hires, and it was Page who provided the signature for the IPO, the latter making him a billionaire at the age of 30.<ref name="Car"/>

Page led the acquisition of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] for $50 million in 2005 to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access Google anywhere. The purchase was made without Schmidt's knowledge, but the CEO was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition. Page became passionate about Android and spent large amounts of time with Android CEO and cofounder [[Andy Rubin]]. By September 2008, [[T-Mobile]] launched the G1, the first phone using Android software and, by 2010, 17.2% of the handset market consisted of Android sales, overtaking Apple for the first time. Android became the world's most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward.<ref name="Car"/>

==== Assumption of CEO position at Google ====
Following a January 2011 announcement,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704881304576094340081291776?mod=googlenews_wsj | title=Google's Page to Replace Schmidt as CEO | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Amir | last=Efrati | date=January 21, 2011 | access-date=August 8, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816061610/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704881304576094340081291776?mod=googlenews_wsj | archive-date=August 16, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Page officially became the chief executive of Google on April 4, 2011, while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/about/company/facts/management/#section-board |title=Management team – Company|accessdate=September 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230160111/http://www.google.com/about/company/facts/management/#section-board |archive-date=December 30, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> By this time, Google had over $180 billion market capitalization and more than 24,000 employees.<ref>[http://www.maintour.com/meritbadge/american_business.htm American Business BSA Merit Badge Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906031557/http://www.maintour.com/meritbadge/american_business.htm |date=September 6, 2015 }}, June 22, 2015.</ref> Reporter Max Nisen, described the decade prior to Page's second appointment as Google's CEO as Page's "lost decade" saying that while he exerted significant influence at Google via product development and other operations, he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time.<ref name="Car" /><ref name="Max">{{cite news|author1=Max Nisen|title=Larry Page's lost decade was the best thing to ever happen to Google|url=http://qz.com/202710/larry-pages-lost-decade-was-the-best-thing-to-ever-happen-to-google/|accessdate=February 6, 2015|work=Quartz|date=April 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202103627/http://qz.com/202710/larry-pages-lost-decade-was-the-best-thing-to-ever-happen-to-google/|archive-date=February 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

After Schmidt announced the end of his tenure as CEO on January 20, 2011, Page jokingly tweeted on Twitter: "Adult-supervision no longer needed."

=== 2011–2013 ===
As Google's new CEO, Page's two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions, and higher levels of collaboration, communication, and unity among the teams. Then Page also formed what the media called the "L-Team", a group of senior vice-presidents who reported directly to him and worked near his office for a portion of the working week.<ref name="Owe">{{cite web|author1=Owen Thomas|title=There's A Pretty Big Tension in How Larry Page Is Running Google|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-larry-page-is-running-google-2013-3?IR=T|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider Inc|accessdate=February 1, 2015|date=March 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120174356/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-larry-page-is-running-google-2013-3?IR=T|archive-date=January 20, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, he reorganized the company's senior management, placing a CEO-like manager at the top of Google's most important product divisions, including YouTube, [[Google Ads|AdWords]], and [[Google Search]].<ref name="Car"/>

Following a more cohesive team environment, Page declared a new "zero tolerance for fighting" policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of Google, when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with Brin as an exemplar for senior management. Page had changed his thinking during his time away from the CEO role, as he eventually concluded that ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic. As part of Page's collaborative rejuvenation process, Google's products and applications were consolidated and underwent an [[aesthetic]] overhaul.<ref name="Max"/><ref name="Die"/>

==== Changes and consolidation process ====
At least 70 of Google's products, features and services were eventually shut down by March 2013, while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Urs Hölzle|title=A second spring of cleaning|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.se/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html|website=Official Google Blog|accessdate=February 3, 2015|date=March 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202103403/http://googleblog.blogspot.se/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html|archive-date=February 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Hel"/> Jon Wiley, lead designer of Google Search at the time, codenamed Page's redesign overhaul, which officially commenced on April 4, 2011, "Project Kennedy", based on Page's use of the term "moonshots" to describe ambitious projects in a January 2013 ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'' interview.<ref name="Die">{{cite web|author1=Dieter Bohn, Ellis Hamburger|title=Redesigning Google: how Larry Page engineered a beautiful revolution|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution|website=The Verge|publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc]]|accessdate=February 1, 2015|date=January 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203001709/http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution|archive-date=February 3, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Lev">{{cite web|author1=Steven Levy|title=Google's Larry Page on Why Moon Shots Matter|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/01/ff-qa-larry-page/all/|website=Wired|accessdate=February 1, 2015|date=January 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201055806/http://www.wired.com/2013/01/ff-qa-larry-page/all/|archive-date=February 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> An initiative named "Kanna" previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for Google's range of products, but it was too difficult at that point in the company's history for one team to drive such change. Matias Duarte, senior director of the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] user experience when "Kennedy" started, explained in 2013 that "Google passionately cares about design." Page proceeded to consult with the Google Creative Lab design team, based in New York City, to find an answer to his question of what a "cohesive vision" of Google might look like.<ref name="Die"/>

The eventual results of "Kennedy" which were progressively rolled out from June 2011 until January 2013, were described by [[The Verge]] technology publication as focused upon "refinement, white space, cleanliness, elasticity, usefulness, and most of all simplicity."  The final products were aligned with Page's aim for a consistent suite of products that can "move fast",  and "Kennedy" was called a "design revolution" by Duarte. Page's "UXA" (user/graphics interface) design team then emerged from the "Kennedy" project, tasked with "designing and developing a true [[User interface|UI]] framework that transforms Google's [[application software]] into a beautiful, mature, accessible and consistent platform for its users." Unspoken of in public, the small UXA unit was designed to ensure that "Kennedy" became an "institution."<ref name="Die"/>

==== Acquisition strategy and new products ====
When acquiring products and companies for Google, Page asked whether the [[business acquisition]] passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier, asking the question "Is it something you will use once or twice a day, and does it make your life better?". This approach looked for usefulness above profitability, and long-term potential over near-term financial gain, which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/how-google-s-ceo-only-buys-companies-that-pass-his-crazy-toothbrush-test.html |title = Why Google's Larry Page Only Buys Companies That Pass His Crazy Toothbrush Test |website = Inc.com |access-date = February 8, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150208082135/http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/how-google-s-ceo-only-buys-companies-that-pass-his-crazy-toothbrush-test.html |archive-date = February 8, 2015 |url-status=live |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>

With Facebook's influence rapidly expanding during the start of Page's second tenure, he finally responded to the intensive competition with Google's own social network, [[Google+]], in mid-2011. After several delays, the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by [[Vic Gundotra]], Google's then senior vice president of social.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ben Parr |title=Google Launches Google+ To Battle Facebook [PICS] |url=http://mashable.com/2011/06/28/google-plus/ |website=Mashable |publisher=Mashable |accessdate=February 2, 2015 |date=June 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211011327/http://mashable.com/2011/06/28/google-plus/ |archive-date=February 11, 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

=== 2013–2015 ===
In January 2013, Page participated in a rare interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', in which writer Steven Levy discussed Page's "10X" mentality—Google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least 10 times better than those of its competitors—in the introductory [[blurb]]. [[Astro Teller]], the head of [[Google X]], explained to Levy that 10X is "just core to who he [Page] is", while Page's "focus is on where the next 10X will come from."<ref name="Lev"/> In his interview with Levy, Page referred to the success of YouTube and Android as examples of "crazy" ideas that investors were not initially interested in, saying: "If you're not doing some things that are crazy, then you're doing the wrong things."<ref name="Lev"/> Page also stated he was "very happy" with the status of Google+, and discussed concerns over the Internet concerning the [[SOPA]] bill and an [[International Telecommunication Union]] proposal that had been recently introduced:<blockquote>... I do think the Internet's under much greater attack than it has been in the past. Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff, and so they're a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people's freedoms. But they've also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. I think that governments fight users' freedoms at their peril.<ref name="Lev"/></blockquote>At the May 2013 I/O developers conference in San Francisco, Page delivered a keynote address and said "We're at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, we're still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think a lot of that is because of the negativity ... Every story I read is Google vs someone else.

In September 2013, Page launched the independent [[Calico (company)|Calico]] initiative, a [[R&D]] project in the field of [[biotechnology]]. Google announced that Calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health, and appointed Art Levinson, chairman of Apple's board and former CEO of [[Genentech]], to be the new division's CEO. Page's official statement read: "Illness and aging affect all our families. With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and [[biotechnology]], I believe we can improve millions of lives."<ref>{{cite web |author=Casey Newton |title=Google launches Calico, a new company tasked with extending human life |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4744650/google-launches-calico-as-separate-company-to-improve-human-health |website=The Verge |publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]] |accessdate=February 2, 2015 |date=September 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202205940/http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4744650/google-launches-calico-as-separate-company-to-improve-human-health |archive-date=February 2, 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Page participated in a March 2014 TedX conference that was held in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. The presentation was scripted by Page's chief [[Public relations|PR]] executive Rachel Whetstone, and Google's [[Chief marketing officer|CMO]] Lorraine Twohill, and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen.<ref name="Car"/>
Page responded to a question about corporations, noting that corporations largely get a "bad rap", which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing "50 or 20 years ago". He went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of Google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate. Page mentioned [[Elon Musk]] and [[SpaceX]]:<blockquote>He [Musk] wants to go to Mars to back up humanity. That's a worthy goal. We have a lot of employees at Google who've become pretty wealthy.

In a November 2014 interview, Page stated that he prioritized the maintenance of his "deep knowledge" of Google's products and breadth of projects, as it had been a key motivating factor for team members. About his then role as the company's CEO, Page said: "I think my job as CEO—I feel like it's always to be pushing people ahead."<ref name="Hel"/>

On August 10, 2015, Page announced on Google's official blog that Google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new [[holding company]] known as [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc]] with Page becoming CEO of [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc]] and [[Sundar Pichai]] assuming the position of CEO of [[Google Inc.]] In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:<ref name="gIsForGoogle">{{Cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html|title=G is for Google|publisher=Google Official Blog|last=Page|first=Larry|accessdate=August 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210148/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html|archive-date=August 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><blockquote>Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. ... Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren't very related.</blockquote>As well as explaining the origin of the company's name:<blockquote>We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha‑bet ([[Alpha (finance)|Alpha]] is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!</blockquote>Page wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google "cleaner and more accountable."  He also wrote that there was a desire to improve "the transparency and oversight of what we're doing" and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within the Google ecosystem.<ref name="gIsForGoogle"/><ref name="wire-2015-new-company">{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Cade|title=A New Company Called Alphabet Now Owns Google|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/08/new-company-called-alphabet-owns-google/|website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|accessdate=August 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122143410/https://www.wired.com/2015/08/new-company-called-alphabet-owns-google/|archive-date=November 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Page|first=Larry|author-link1=Larry Page|title=G is for Google |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html |website=Official Google Blog |accessdate=August 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210148/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html |archive-date=August 10, 2015|url-status=live|date=August 10, 2015}}</ref>

Page has not been on any press conferences since 2015 and has not presented at product launches or earnings calls since 2013. The ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' termed the reorganization into Alphabet as a clever retirement plan allowing Page to retain control over Google, at the same time relinquishing all responsibilities over it. Executives at Alphabet describe Page as a "futurist", highly detached from day-to-day business dealings, and more focused on moon-shot projects. While some managers of Alphabet companies speak of Page as intensely involved, others say that his rare office check-ins are "akin to a royal visit" .<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-09-13/larry-page-is-a-no-show-with-google-under-a-harsh-spotlight|title=Where in the World Is Larry Page?|last1=Bergen|first1=Mark|last2=Carr|first2=Austin|date=September 13, 2018|magazine=Bloomberg Businessweek|access-date=September 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918092518/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-09-13/larry-page-is-a-no-show-with-google-under-a-harsh-spotlight|archive-date=September 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On December 3, 2019, Larry Page announced that he will step down from the position of Alphabet CEO and would be replaced by Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Pichai will also continue as Google CEO. Page and Google co-founder and Alphabet president Sergey Brin announced the change in a joint blog post, "With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it’s the natural time to simplify our management structure. We’ve never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there’s a better way to run the company.

In 2009, Page began purchasing properties and tearing down homes adjacent to his home in [[Palo Alto]] to make room for a large [[ecohouse]]. The existing buildings were "deconstructed" and the materials donated for reuse. The ecohouse was designed to "minimize the impact on the environment." Page worked with an [[arborist]] to replace some trees that were in poor health with others that used less water to maintain. Page also applied for Green Point Certification, with points given for use of recycled and low or no-VOC ([[volatile organic compound]]) materials and for a roof garden with [[solar panels]].
