==History==
{{Main|History of IBM}}

IBM was founded in 1911 in [[Endicott, New York]], as the [[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company]] (CTR) and was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924. IBM is incorporated in New York and has operations in over 170 countries.<ref>{{cite web|website=10-K|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51143/104746919000712/0001047469-19-000712-index.htm|title=10-K|access-date=June 1, 2019|ref={{harvid|10-K|2018}}}}</ref>

In the 1880s technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of International Business Machines (IBM). Julius E.

In 1937 IBM's tabulating equipment enabled organizations to process huge amounts of data. Its clients included the [[U.S. Government]], during its first effort to maintain the employment records for 26&nbsp;million people pursuant to the [[Social Security Act]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/ibm.html|title=Early Automation Challenges for SSA|first=Larry|last=DeWitt|date=April 2000|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref> and Hitler's [[Third Reich]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/1388.wss|date=February 14, 2001|title=IBM Statement on Nazi-era Book and Lawsuit|publisher=IBM Press room}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/142991/edwin-black-ibm-nazi-holocaust-history|title=This Is the Hidden Nazi History of IBM — And the Man Who Tried to Expose It|publisher=Tech.Mic}}</ref> for the tracking of Jews and other persecuted groups, largely through the German subsidiary [[Dehomag]].

In 1949 Thomas Watson, Sr., created IBM World Trade Corporation, a subsidiary of IBM focused on foreign operations.<ref name="WTC1949">{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ibmworldtrade/|title=The Creation of the World Trade Corporation|publisher=IBM Corp.|website=IBM.com|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}</ref> In 1952 he stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm, and his son [[Thomas Watson, Jr.]] was named president. 

IBM built the [[Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator]], an electromechanical computer, during World War II. It offered its first commercial stored program computer, the [[vacuum tube]] based [[IBM 701]], in 1952. The [[IBM 305 RAMAC]] introduced the [[hard disk drive]] in 1956. The company switched to transistorized designs with the [[IBM 700/7000 series|7000]] and [[IBM 1400 series|1400]] series, beginning in 1958.

In 1956 the company demonstrated the first practical example of [[artificial intelligence]] when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's [[Poughkeepsie]], New York, laboratory programmed an [[IBM 704]] not merely to play checkers but "learn" from its own experience. In 1957 the [[FORTRAN]] scientific programming language was developed. In 1961 IBM developed the [[Sabre (computer system)|SABRE reservation system]] for [[American Airlines]] and introduced the highly successful [[IBM Selectric typewriter|Selectric]] typewriter.

In 1963 IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flights of the Mercury astronauts. A year later, it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to [[Armonk, New York]]. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights, and 1969 lunar mission.

[[File:IBM360-67AtUmichWithMikeAlexander.jpg|thumb|right|An [[IBM System/360]] in use at the [[University of Michigan]] c. 1969]]

On April 7, 1964, IBM announced the first computer system family, the [[IBM System/360]]. It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the [[IBM System/370]] in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the [[IBM mainframe]] the dominant [[mainframe computer]] and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s.

In 1969 the United States of America alleged that IBM violated the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the general-purpose electronic digital computer system market, specifically computers designed primarily for business, and subsequently alleged that IBM violated the antitrust laws in IBM's actions directed against leasing companies and plug-compatible peripheral manufacturers.  Shortly after, IBM unbundled its software and services in what many observers believed was a direct result of the lawsuit, creating a competitive market for software.  In 1982 the Department of Justice dropped the case as “without merit.”

Also in 1969, IBM engineer [[Forrest Parry]] invented the [[magnetic stripe card]] that would become ubiquitous for credit/debit/ATM cards, driver's licenses, rapid transit cards, and a multitude of other identity and access control applications. IBM pioneered the manufacture of these cards, and for most of the 1970s, the data processing systems and software for such applications ran exclusively on IBM computers.
In 1974 IBM engineer [[George J. Laurer]] developed the [[Universal Product Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cummingsdesign.com/bar_code_history.htm|title=The history of the UPC bar code and how the bar code symbol and system became a world standard.|publisher=Cummingsdesign|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}</ref> IBM and the [[World Bank]] first introduced [[Swap (finance)|financial swaps]] to the public in 1981 when they entered into a swap agreement.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of Corporate Finance|edition=9th, alternate|last1=Ross|last2=Westerfield|last3=Jordan|year=2010|publisher=[[McGraw Hill]]|page=746}}</ref> The [[IBM PC]], originally designated IBM 5150, was introduced in 1981, and it soon became an industry standard. In 1991 IBM spun out its printer manufacturing into a new business called [[Lexmark]].

IBM has one of the largest workforces in the world, and employees at Big Blue are referred to as "IBMers". The company was among the first corporations to provide [[Life insurance#Group life insurance|group life insurance]] (1934), survivor benefits (1935), training for women (1935), paid vacations (1937), and training for disabled people (1942). IBM hired its first black salesperson in 1946, and in 1952, CEO [[Thomas J. Watson, Jr.]] published the company's first written equal opportunity policy letter, one year before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in [[Brown vs. Board of Education]] and 11 years before the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The [[Human Rights Campaign]] has rated IBM 100% on its index of gay-friendliness every year since 2003,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Search_the_Database&Template=/CustomSource/WorkNet/srch_dtl.cfm&srchtype=QS&searchid=34&orgid=1238|title=International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) profile|publisher=HRC Corporate Equality Index Score}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> with IBM providing same-sex partners of its employees with [[Health insurance|health benefits]] and an anti-discrimination clause. Additionally, in 2005, IBM became the first major company in the world to commit formally to not use [[genetic testing|genetic information]] in employment decisions; and in 2017, IBM was named to ''[[Working Mother]]''{{'}}s 100 Best Companies List for the 32nd consecutive year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.workingmother.com/best-companies-ibm|title=IBM|website=Working Mother}}</ref>

IBM has several leadership development and recognition programs to recognize employee potential and achievements. For early-career high potential employees, IBM sponsors leadership development programs by discipline (e.g., [[management|general management]] (GMLDP), [[human resources management|human resources]] (HRLDP), [[finance]] (FLDP)). Each year, the company also selects 500 IBMers for the IBM Corporate Service Corps (CSC),<ref>{{cite web|title=The IBM Corporate Service Corps|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/responsibility/corporateservicecorps/|publisher=IBM CSC|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> which has been described as the corporate equivalent of the [[Peace Corps]] and gives top employees a month to do [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian work]] abroad.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why IBM Gives Top Employees a Month to Do Service Abroad|url=https://hbr.org/2014/11/why-ibm-gives-top-employees-a-month-to-do-service-abroad|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> For certain [[interns]], IBM also has a program called [[Extreme Blue]] that partners top business and technical students to develop high-value technology and compete to present their business case to the company's CEO at internship's end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/employment/us/extremeblue/|title=Extreme Blue web page|publisher=01.ibm.com|date=September 7, 2007|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>

The company also has various designations for exceptional individual contributors such as Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM), Research Staff Member (RSM), Distinguished Engineer (DE), and Distinguished Designer (DD).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taft|first1=Derryl|title=IBM Launches Distinguished Designer Program|url=http://www.eweek.com/developer/ibm-launches-distinguished-designer-program.html|publisher=eWeek|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> Prolific inventors can also achieve patent plateaus and earn the designation of [[IBM Master Inventor|Master Inventor]]. The company's most prestigious designation is that of [[IBM Fellow]]. Since 1963, the company names a handful of Fellows each year based on technical achievement. Other programs recognize years of service such as the Quarter Century Club established in 1924, and sellers are eligible to join the Hundred Percent Club, composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas, convened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Each year, the company also selects 1,000 IBMers annually to award the Best of IBM Award, which includes an all-expenses-paid trip to the awards ceremony in an exotic location.

IBM's culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a "sincere" tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees.<ref name="Strategic Marketing">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Paul Russell|title=Strategic Marketing Communications: New Ways to Build and Integrate Communications|publisher=Kogan Page|year=1999|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYvbeQLf_gEC&q=%22sincere+tie%22+ibm&pg=PA24|isbn=0-7494-2918-6}}</ref> During IBM's management transformation in the 1990s, CEO [[Louis V.
