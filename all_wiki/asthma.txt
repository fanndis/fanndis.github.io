==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Pathophysiology of asthma}}

Asthma is the result of chronic [[inflammation]] of the [[conducting zone]] of the airways (most especially the [[bronchus|bronchi]] and [[bronchiole]]s), which subsequently results in increased contractability of the surrounding [[smooth muscle]]s.<!-- <ref name=GINA2011p2/> --> This among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of the airway and the classic symptoms of wheezing.<!-- <ref name=GINA2011p2/> --> The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment.<!-- <ref name=GINA2011p2/> --> Occasionally the airways themselves change.<ref name=GINA2011p2/> Typical changes in the airways include an increase in [[eosinophils]] and thickening of the [[lamina reticularis]].<!-- <ref name=M38/> --> Chronically the airways' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands.<!-- <ref name=M38/> --> Other cell types involved include: [[T lymphocytes]], [[macrophages]], and [[neutrophils]].<!-- <ref name=M38/> --> There may also be involvement of other components of the [[immune system]] including: [[cytokines]], [[chemokines]], [[histamine]], and [[leukotrienes]] among others.<ref name=M38/>

==Diagnosis==
While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.<ref name=M38/> It is defined by the [[Global Initiative for Asthma]] as "a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment".<ref name=GINA2011p2 />

There is currently no precise test for the diagnosis, which is typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time.<ref name=Lemanske2010/><ref name=M38/> Asthma may be suspected if there is a history of recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens or air pollution.<ref name=NAEPP42>{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=42}}</ref> [[Spirometry]] is then used to confirm the diagnosis.<ref name=NAEPP42/> In children under the age of six the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry.<ref name=GINA2011p20>{{harvnb|GINA|2011|p=20}}</ref>

An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an ''asthma attack''.

Signs occurring during an asthma attack include the use of accessory [[muscle]]s of respiration ([[sternocleidomastoid]] and [[scalene muscles]] of the neck), there may be a [[pulsus paradoxus|paradoxical pulse]] (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation), and over-inflation of the chest.<ref name=Maitre1995>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maitre B, Similowski T, Derenne JP | title = Physical examination of the adult patient with respiratory diseases: inspection and palpation | journal = The European Respiratory Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = 1584–93 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8575588 | url = http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/8/9/1584.long | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150429223309/http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/8/9/1584.long | archive-date = 2015-04-29 }}</ref> A [[cyanosis|blue color]] of the skin and nails may occur from lack of oxygen.<ref name=Werner2001>{{cite journal | vauthors = Werner HA | title = Status asthmaticus in children: a review | journal = Chest | volume = 119 | issue = 6 | pages = 1913–29 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11399724 | doi = 10.1378/chest.119.6.1913 }}</ref>

====Delivery methods====

Medications are typically provided as [[metered-dose inhaler]]s (MDIs) in combination with an [[asthma spacer]] or as a [[dry powder inhaler]]. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A [[nebulizer]] may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.<ref name="NHLBI07p250">{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=250}}</ref> For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cates CJ, Welsh EJ, Rowe BH | title = Holding chambers (spacers) versus nebulisers for beta-agonist treatment of acute asthma | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 9 | pages = CD000052 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24037768 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000052.pub3 | pmc = 7032675 | editor-last = Cochrane Airways Group }}</ref> There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Travers AH, Milan SJ, Jones AP, Camargo CA, Rowe BH | title = Addition of intravenous beta(2)-agonists to inhaled beta(2)-agonists for acute asthma | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = CD010179 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23235685 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010179 }}</ref> There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodriguez C, Sossa M, Lozano JM | title = Commercial versus home-made spacers in delivering bronchodilator therapy for acute therapy in children | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD005536 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18425921 | pmc = 6483735 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005536.pub2 }}</ref>

Asthma was recognized in [[ancient Egypt]] and was treated by drinking an [[incense]] mixture known as [[kyphi]].<ref name="Manniche1999"/> It was officially named as a specific respiratory problem by [[Hippocrates]] circa 450 BC, with the Greek word for "panting" forming the basis of our modern name.<ref name=M38/> In 200 BC it was believed to be at least partly related to the emotions.<ref name=Andrew2010/> In the 12th century the Jewish physician-philosopher [[Maimonides]] wrote a treatise on asthma in Arabic, based partly on Arabic sources, in which he discussed the symptoms, proposed various dietary and other means of treatment, and emphasized the importance of climate and clean air.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.aecom.yu.edu/uploadedFiles/EJBM/19Rosner125.pdf |first=Fred |last=Rosner |author-link=Fred Rosner |title=The Life of Moses Maimonides, a Prominent Medieval Physician |journal=Einstein Quart J Biol Med |year=2002 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=125–28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305065423/http://www.aecom.yu.edu/uploadedFiles/EJBM/19Rosner125.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-05 }}</ref>

A notable and well-documented case in the 19th century was that of young [[Theodore Roosevelt#Early life and family|Theodore Roosevelt]] (1858–1919). At that time there was no effective treatment. Roosevelt's youth was in large part shaped by his poor health partly related to his asthma. He experienced recurring nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, terrifying the boy and his parents.<ref>{{cite book|author=David McCullough|title=Mornings on Horseback: The Story of an Extraordinary Family, a Vanished Way of Life and the Unique Child Who Became Theodore Roosevelt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nuzmvrqPvdIC&pg=PA93|year=1981|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=93–108|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407004947/http://books.google.com/books?id=nuzmvrqPvdIC&pg=PA93|archive-date=2015-04-07|isbn=978-0-7432-1830-6}}</ref>

During the 1930s to 1950s, asthma was known as one of the "holy seven" [[psychosomatic illness]]es. Its cause was considered to be psychological, with treatment often based on psychoanalysis and other [[talking cure]]s.<ref name="pmid16185365"/> As these psychoanalysts interpreted the asthmatic wheeze as the suppressed cry of the child for its mother, they considered the treatment of depression to be especially important for individuals with asthma.<ref name="pmid16185365">{{cite journal | vauthors = Opolski M, Wilson I | title = Asthma and depression: a pragmatic review of the literature and recommendations for future research | journal = Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health | volume = 1 | pages = 18 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16185365 | pmc = 1253523 | doi = 10.1186/1745-0179-1-18 }}</ref>
