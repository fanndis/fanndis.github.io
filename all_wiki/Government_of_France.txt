The '''Government of the French Republic''' ({{lang-fr|Gouvernement de la République française}} {{IPA-fr|ɡuvɛʁnəmɑ̃ də la ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛz|}}) exercises [[executive power]] in [[France]]. It is composed of the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], who is the [[head of government]], and both junior and senior [[Minister (government)|ministers]].<ref name="ewe1">{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerdarlington.me.uk/Frenchpoliticalsystem.html |title=A SHORT GUIDE TO THE FRENCH POLITICAL SYSTEM |date=19 October 2014 |access-date=5 December 2014}}</ref> Senior ministers are titled as Ministers ({{lang-fr|Ministres}}), whereas junior ministers are titled as Secretaries of State ({{lang-fr|Secrétaires d'État}}).

The [[Council of Ministers of France|Council of Ministers]] is the main executive organ of the government, established in the [[Constitution of France|Constitution]] and presided over by the [[President of France|President of the Republic]].

== Composition and formation ==
All members of the French government are appointed by the [[President of the French Republic|President of the Republic]] on the advice of the Prime Minister.<ref>[[Wikisource: Constitution of the Fifth French Republic|Constitution of the French Republic (Title II, Article 8)]]</ref> Members of the government are ranked in a precise order, which is established at the time of government formation. In this hierarchy, the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] is the head of government. He is appointed by the President of the Republic. While the President is constitutionally free to appoint whomever he likes, in practice, he must nominate a candidate that reflects the will of the majority of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], as the government is responsible to the [[French Parliament]].<ref name="Bpr">{{cite encyclopedia | title=France: The role of the president | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. | accessdate=6 December 2014 | year=2014 | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/41158/The-role-of-the-president}}</ref> After being nominated to lead a government, the Prime Minister nominee must propose a list of ministers to the President. The President can either accept or reject these proposed ministers. Ministers are ranked by importance:
*[[Minister of State|Ministers of State]] ({{lang-fr|Ministres d'État}}) are senior ministers and are members of the Council of Ministers. It is an honorary rank, granted to some Ministers as a sign of prestige.
*Ministers ({{lang-fr|Ministres}}) are senior ministers and are members of the Council of Ministers. They lead government [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]].
*[[Secretary of state|Secretaries of State]] ({{lang-fr|Secrétaires d'État}}) are junior ministers. This is the lowest rank in the French ministerial hierarchy. Secretaries work directly under a Minister, or sometimes directly under the Prime Minister. While the Council of Ministers does not include Secretaries of State as members, Secretaries may attend meetings of the Council if their portfolio is up for discussion.

==Functions==
According to the [[Constitution of the French Fifth Republic]], the government directs and decides the policy of the nation.<ref name=a20>[[Wikisource:Constitution of the Fifth French Republic#Title III: The Government|Constitution of the French Republic (Title III, Article 20)]]</ref> In practice, the government writes [[Bill (law)|bills]] to be introduced to [[Parliament of France|parliament]], and also writes and issues [[Decree#France|decrees]]. All political decisions made by the government must be registered in the [[Journal officiel de la République française|government gazette]].

===Council of Ministers===
The Council of Ministers ({{lang-fr|Conseil des ministres}}) is established by the [[Constitution of France|Constitution]].  It is composed only of the senior ministers, though some Secretaries of State may attend Council meetings. The Council of Ministers is chaired by the President, unlike the government, but is still led by the Prime Minister, who was officially titled as the [[President of the Council of Ministers]] ({{lang-fr|Président du Conseil des ministres}}) during the [[French Third Republic|Third]] and [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republics]].<ref name="ewe1" />

All bills and some decrees must be approved by the Council of Ministers. Furthermore, it is the Council of Ministers that defines the collective political and policy direction of the government, and takes practical steps to implement that direction. In addition to writing and implementing policy, the government is responsible for national defense, and directs the actions of the [[French Armed Forces]].<ref name=a20/> The workings of the government of France are based on the principle of [[collegiality]].

Meetings of the Council of Ministers take place every Wednesday morning at the [[Élysée Palace]]. They are presided over by the President of the Republic, who promotes solidarity and collegiality amongst government ministers.<ref>[[Wikisource: Constitution of the Fifth French Republic#Title II: The President of the Republic|Constitution of the French Republic (Title II, Article 9)]]</ref> These meetings follow a set format. In the first part of a meeting, the Council deliberates over general interest bills, ordinances, and decrees.<ref name="GFhgw">{{cite web | url=http://www.gouvernement.fr/en/how-government-works | title=How Government works | publisher=Government of France | accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> In the second part, the Council discusses individual decisions by each Minister regarding the appointment of senior [[Civil service|civil servants]]. In the third part, usually, either one Minister will give a presentation about some reform or project that he or she is directing, or the President will ask for advice on some subject from the Ministers. In addition, the Minister of Foreign Affairs provides the Council with weekly updates on important international issues.<ref name="GFhgw" />

===Ministries===
Most government work, however, is done elsewhere. Much of it is done by each individual ministry, under the direction of the Minister responsible for that ministry. Ministers each have their own staff, called a "ministerial cabinet" ({{lang-fr|Cabinet ministériel}}).<ref name="Minicab">{{cite journal | title=Ministerial Cabinets in France | author=A. DUTHEILLET DE LAMOTHE | journal=Public Administration |date=December 1965  | volume=43 | issue=4 | pages=365–475 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9299.1965.tb01658.x}}</ref> Each ministerial cabinet consists of around ten to twenty members, who are political appointees. Cabinet members assist the Minister in running a ministry. Members of ministerial cabinets are powerful figures within the government and work in both the political and administrative spheres.<ref name=" Minicab"/> The hierarchy in each ministerial cabinet is determined by the Minister. Working groups consisting of representatives from several ministries are commonplace. It is the duty of the Prime Minister to oversee these inter-ministry meetings and to ensure that government work is done effectively and efficiently.

===Budget===
The government is responsible for the economic and financial policy of the [[French Republic]], must authorize all expenditures made by each ministry, and also manage all revenue. Expenditures are made through what is called a "finance law" ({{lang-fr|Loi des Finances}}), which is equivalent to an [[appropriation bill]]. Each minister must prepare a list of requests for funds annually, and submit it to the Budget Ministry. This ministry decides whether to grant or deny requests for funding by ministers. The ministry also calculates the state budget for the coming year. The parliament must vote on all applications of finance law.

==Separation of powers==
Members of the French Government cannot occupy any position of occupational or trade leadership at the national level, any public employment, or any professional activity.<ref>[[Wikisource: Constitution of the Fifth French Republic#Title III: The Government|Constitution of the French Republic (Title III, Article 23)]]</ref> These restrictions are in place to alleviate external pressure and influence on ministers, and to enable them to focus on their governmental work. Despite these restrictions, members of the government are [[cumul des mandats|allowed to keep local elected positions]], such as those of city mayor or regional councilor. Whilst the Constitution of the French Republic does not prohibit ministers from being the leader of a political party, it is customary that ministers should not occupy such a post.

The government is responsible for the [[French Parliament]]. In particular, the government must assume responsibility for its actions before the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], and the National Assembly can dismiss the government with a [[motion of censure]].<ref>[[Wikisource: Constitution of the Fifth French Republic#Title V: Relations between Parliament and Government|Constitution of the French Republic (Title V, Article 49)]]</ref> The government cannot function during the tenure of acting (interim) president, as that position is granted either to the [[President of the Senate of France|President of the Senate]] or the Prime Minister, compromising [[separation of powers]]. If the government decides to launch an armed operation with a duration of longer than four months, it must first consult parliament and request an authorization.<ref>[[Wikisource: Constitution of the Fifth French Republic#Title V: Relations between Parliament and Government|Constitution of the French Republic (Title V, Article 35)]]</ref> The Prime Minister may convene parliament for extraordinary sessions, or add additional sitting days to the legislative calendar.<ref>[[Wikisource: Constitution of the Fifth French Republic#Title IV: Parliament|Constitution of the French Republic (Title IV, Articles 28 and 29)]]</ref>
