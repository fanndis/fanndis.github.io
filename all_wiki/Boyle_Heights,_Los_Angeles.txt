'''Boyle Heights''' is a [[neighborhood]] located in the region east of the [[Los Angeles River]] with almost 100,000 residents in [[Los Angeles, California]].

Boyle Heights became Los Angeles’s largest residential communities of Japanese immigrants and Americans, apart from Little Tokyo.

==Latino political influence==
[[File:BoyleHotel.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Boyle Hotel – Cummings Block|Boyle Hotel]], 2014]]

The emergence of Latino politics in Boyle Heights influenced the diversity in the community. Boyle Heights was a predominantly Jewish community with "a vibrant, pre-World War II, [[Yiddish]]-speaking community, replete with small shops along Brooklyn Avenue, [[labor union|union]] halls, synagogues and hyperactive politics ... shaped by the enduring influence of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] and [[Communist Party USA|Communist]] parties"{{r|Burt 2008}} before Boyle Heights became predominantly associated with Mexicans/Mexican Americans. The rise of the socialist and communist parties increased the people's involvement in politics in the community because the "liberal-left exercised great influence in the immigrant community".{{r|Burt 2008|p=22-23}} Even with an ever-growing diversity in Boyle Heights, "Jews remained culturally and politically dominant after World War II".{{r|Burt 2008|p=22}}

Nevertheless, as the Jewish community was moving westward into new homes, the largest growing group, Latinos, was moving into Boyle Heights because to them this neighborhood was represented as upward mobility. With Jews and Latinos both in Boyle Heights, these men, part of the [[Jewish Community Relations Council]] (JCRC) — Louis Levy, Ben Solnit, Pinkhas Karl, Harry Sheer, and Julius Levitt — helped to empower the Latinos who either lived among the Jewish people or who worked together in the factories.

The combination of Jewish people and Latinos in Boyle Heights symbolized a tight unity between the two communities. The two groups helped to elect [[Edward R. Roybal]] to the City Council over Councilman Christensen; with the help from the [[Community Service Organization]] (CSO). In order for Roybal to win a landslide victory over Christensen, "the JCRC, with representation from business and labor leaders, associated with both Jewish left traditions, had become the prime financial benefactor to CSO .. labor historically backed incumbents ... [and] the Cold War struggle for the hearts and minds of minority workers also influenced the larger political dynamic".{{r|Burt 2008|p=26}}

[[File:CASA 0101.jpg|thumb|right|CASA 0101 Theater, 2014]]
In the 1947 election, Edward Roybal lost, but Jewish community activist [[Saul Alinsky]] and the [[Industrial Areas Foundation]] (IAF) garnered support from Mexican Americans to bring Roybal to victory two years later 1949.<ref name="Bernstein 2011">The Community Service Organization (CSO) helped Roybal win the election and to increase the multi-racial involvement in Boyle Heights.</ref>(Bernstein, 243) When Roybal took office as city councilman in 1949, he experienced racism when trying to buy a home for his family. The real-estate agent told him that he could not sell to Mexicans, and Roybal's first act as councilman was to protest racial discrimination and to create a community that represented inter-racial politics in Boyle Heights.<ref name="Bernstein 2011"/>(Bernstein, 224).

This Latino-Jewish relationship shaped politics in that when [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] became mayor of Los Angeles in 2005, "not only did he have ties to Boyle Heights, but he was elected by replicating the labor-based, multicultural coalition that Congressman Edward Roybal assembled in 1949 to become Los Angeles's first city council member of Latino heritage".{{r|Burt 2008|p=23}} Further, the Vladeck Center (named after [[Borukh Charney Vladeck]]) contributed to the community of Boyle Heights in a big way because it was not just a building, it was "a venue for a wide range of activities that promoted Jewish culture and politics".{{r|Burt 2008|p=22}}

== East LA Interchange ==
In 1961, the construction of the [[East LA Interchange]] began. At 135 acres in size, the interchange is three times larger than the average highway system, even expanding at some points to 27 lanes in width.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Estrada|first=Gilbert|date=October 2005|title=If You Build It, They Will Move: The Los Angeles Freeway System and the Displacement of Mexican East Los Angeles, 1944-1972|journal=Southern California Quarterly|volume=87|issue=3|pages=287–315|doi=10.2307/41172272|issn=0038-3929|jstor=41172272}}</ref> Also known as the Spaghetti Bowl,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} the enormity of the structure and the complexity of its many routes called for a $17,000 blueprint model of the highway long before construction even began. During its construction, engineers built 32 bridges and 20 walls, excavated 1,500,000 yards of earth, laid 23,545 feet of concrete pipe, and used 4,200,000 yards of structural steel and 13,200,000 pounds of reinforced steel to complete the busiest freeway interchange in the world.<ref name=":0" /> The interchange handles around 1.7 million vehicles daily and has produced one of the most traffic congested regions in the world as well as one of the most concentrated pockets of air pollution in America.<ref name=":0" />

Since the 1920s, both elite and working-class communities throughout Southern California have witnessed the enforcement of highly effective racial covenants and other exclusionary measures that aim to distinguish separate white and non-white neighborhoods. By the 1960s, the federal government declared certain areas as “White Group Zones” which forced any non-whites in those areas out of their homes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sánchez|first=George J.|date=2017-01-23|title=Why Are Multiracial Communities So Dangerous?|journal=Pacific Historical Review|volume=86|issue=1|pages=153–170|doi=10.1525/phr.2017.86.1.153|issn=0030-8684}}</ref>

This resulted in the development of Boyle Heights, a multicultural, interethnic neighborhood in East Los Angeles whose celebration of cultural difference has made it a role model for democracy. Since the establishment of multicultural neighborhoods like Boyle Heights was a byproduct of the gentrification of minorities into separate urban area homelands, people in these interracial communities have become considered “disposable people” who are desirable targets for gentrification.<ref name=":0" />

==Education==
Just 5% of Boyle Heights residents aged 25 and older had earned a [[four-year degree]] by 2000, a low percentage for the city and the county. The percentage of residents in that age range who had not earned a [[high school diploma]] was high for the county.<ref name=MappingLABoyleHeights>{{Cite web |url=http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/neighborhood/boyle-heights/ |title="Boyle Heights," Mapping L.A., ''Los Angeles Times'' |access-date=2013-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023045208/http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/neighborhood/boyle-heights/ |archive-date=2013-10-23 |url-status=live }}</ref>
