==Views and perspectives==

===Bioethics and medicine===
Krauthammer was a supporter of [[abortion]] legalization (although he believed Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided) and opposed to [[euthanasia]].<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/10/AR2007051001806.html "Giuliani's Abortion 'Gaffe'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005203016/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/10/AR2007051001806.html |date=October 5, 2017 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''The Washington Post'', May 11, 2007.</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/15/AR2005091502141.html "Roe v.

Krauthammer was appointed to President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[President's Council on Bioethics|Council on Bioethics]] in 2002. He supported relaxing the Bush administration's limits on federal funding of discarded human embryonic [[Stem cell laws and policy in the United States|stem cell research]].<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/04/AR2005080401825.html "Cell Lines, Moral Lines; Research Should Expand—With a Key Limit"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817075237/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/04/AR2005080401825.html |date=August 17, 2017 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''The Washington Post'', Friday, August 5, 2005.</ref> Krauthammer supported [[embryonic stem cell research]] using embryos discarded by fertility clinics with restrictions in its applications.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/11/AR2007011101571.html "Stem Cell Miracle?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224200506/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/11/AR2007011101571.html |date=December 24, 2017 }} by Charles Krauthammer ''The Washington Post'', January 12, 2007.</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/04/AR2005080401825.html "Cell Lines, Moral Lines"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817075237/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/04/AR2005080401825.html |date=August 17, 2017 }} by Charles Krauthammer ''The Washington Post'', August 5, 2005.</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A63060-2002May9 "Research Cloning?

A fellow member of the Council, [[Janet D. Rowley]], insists that Krauthammer's vision was still an issue far in the future and not a topic to be discussed at the present time.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/18/politics/18ETHI.html "Bush's Advisers on Ethics Discuss Human Cloning"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818191341/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/18/politics/18ETHI.html |date=August 18, 2016 }} by Sheryl Gay Stolberg, ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 18, 2002.</ref>

In March 2009, Krauthammer was invited to the signing of an executive order by President [[Barack Obama]] at the White House but declined to attend because of his fears about the [[cloning of human embryos]] and the creation of normal human embryos solely for purposes of research. He also contrasted the "moral seriousness" of Bush's stem cell address of August 9, 2001, with that of Obama's address on stem cells.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/12/AR2009031202764.html "Obama's 'Science' Fiction"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226110552/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/12/AR2009031202764.html |date=February 26, 2017 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''The Washington Post'', March 13, 2009.</ref>

Krauthammer was critical of the idea of [[living wills]] and the current state of [[end-of-life (medical treatment)|end-of-life counseling]] and feared that [[Obamacare]] would just worsen the situation:

{{quote|When my father was dying, my mother and brother and I had to decide how much treatment to pursue. What was a better way to ascertain my father's wishes: What he checked off on a form one fine summer's day years before being stricken; or what we, who had known him intimately for decades, thought he would want?

===Energy and global warming===

Krauthammer was a longtime advocate of radically higher energy [[taxation in the United States|taxes]] to induce [[energy conservation|conservation]].<ref>"The Oil-Bust Panic" by Charles Krauthammer, ''[[The New Republic]]'', February 21, 1983.</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/10/AR2005111001502.html "Pump Some Seriousness Into Energy Policy"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006062058/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/10/AR2005111001502.html |date=October 6, 2017 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''The Washington Post'', November 11, 2005.</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012501547.html "Energy Independence?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810112154/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012501547.html |date=August 10, 2017 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''The Washington Post'', January 26, 2007.</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/28/AR2007062801793.html "The Tax-Free Lunch"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006012556/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/28/AR2007062801793.html |date=October 6, 2017 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''The Washington Post'', June 29, 2007.</ref>

Krauthammer wrote in ''The Washington Post'' on February 20, 2014, "I'm not a [[global warming]] believer. I'm not a [[Climate change denial|global warming denier]]." Objecting to declaring global warming settled science, he contended that much that is believed to be settled turns out not to be so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-the-myth-of-settled-science/2014/02/20/c1f8d994-9a75-11e3-b931-0204122c514b_story.html|title=The myth of 'settled science'|work=The Washington Post|date=February 20, 2014|access-date=February 24, 2014|author=Krauthammer, Charles|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224182611/http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-the-myth-of-settled-science/2014/02/20/c1f8d994-9a75-11e3-b931-0204122c514b_story.html|archive-date=February 24, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
Krauthammer first gained attention in the mid-1980s when he first used the phrase "[[Reagan Doctrine]]" in his [[Time magazine]] column.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964873,00.html The Reagan Doctrine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209154146/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964873,00.html |date=February 9, 2008 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, April 1, 1985.</ref> The phrase was a reference to the American foreign policy of supporting anti-communist insurgencies around the globe (most notably [[Nicaragua]], [[Angola]], and [[Afghanistan]]) as a response to the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] and reflected a U.S. foreign policy that went beyond [[containment]] of the [[Soviet Union]] to [[rollback]] of recent Soviet influence in the [[Third World]]. The policy, which was strongly supported by [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] foreign policy analysts and other conservatives, was ultimately embraced by Reagan's senior national security and foreign policy officials. Krauthammer's description of it as the "Reagan Doctrine" has since endured.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In "The Poverty of Realism" (''New Republic'', February 17, 1986), he asserted:

{{quote|that the end of American foreign policy is not just the security of the United States, but what [[John F. Kennedy]] called "the success of liberty." That means, first, defending the community of democratic nations (the repository of the liberal idea) and second, encouraging the establishment of new liberal policies at the frontier, most especially in the Third World.}}
The foreign policy, he argued, should be both "universal in aspiration" and "prudent in application", thus combining American [[Idealism (international relations)|idealism]] and [[Realism in international relations theory|realism]]. Over the next 20 years these ideas developed into what is now called "democratic realism."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Following the [[Cold War]], Krauthammer penned an article entitled "The Unipolar Moment".<ref name="Unipolar"/> Krauthammer coined the term ''unipolarity'' to describe the world structure that was emerging with the fall of the Soviet Union.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Krauthammer predicted that the bipolar world of the Cold War would give way not to a multipolar world in which the U.S. was one of many centers of power, but a unipolar world dominated by the United States with a power gap between the most powerful state and the second most powerful state that would exceed any other in history. He also suggested that American [[hegemony]] would inevitably exist for only a historical "moment" lasting at most three or four decades.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Hegemony gave the United States the capacity and responsibility to act unilaterally if necessary, Krauthammer argued. Throughout the 1990s, however, he was circumspect about how that power ought to be used. He split from his neoconservative colleagues who were arguing for an interventionist policy of "American greatness". Krauthammer wrote that in the absence of a global existential threat, the United States should stay out of "teacup wars" in failed states, and instead adopt a "dry powder" foreign policy of nonintervention and readiness.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.aei.org/books/bookID.755,filter.all/book_detail.asp Democratic Realism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830053137/http://www.aei.org/books/bookID.755,filter.all/book_detail.asp |date=August 30, 2007 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''[[American Enterprise Institute]]'', February 2004.</ref> 
Krauthammer opposed purely "humanitarian intervention" (with the exception of overt genocide). While he supported the 1991 Gulf War on the grounds of both humanitarianism and strategic necessity (preventing [[Saddam Hussein]] from gaining control of the [[Persian Gulf]] and its resources), he opposed American intervention in the [[Yugoslav Wars]] on the grounds that America should not be committing the lives of its soldiers to purely humanitarian missions in which there is no American national interest at stake.<ref>[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/krauthammer040300.asp The Path to Putin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815192422/http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/krauthammer040300.asp |date=August 15, 2007 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''The Washington Post'', April 3, 2000.</ref>

Krauthammer's major 2004 monograph on foreign policy, "Democratic Realism: An American Foreign Policy for a Unipolar World",<ref name=autogenerated1 /> was critical both of the neoconservative Bush doctrine for being too expansive and utopian, and of foreign policy "realism" for being too narrow and immoral; instead, he proposed an alternative he called "Democratic Realism".

In a 2005 speech later published in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine, Krauthammer called neoconservatism "a governing ideology whose time has come." He noted that the original "fathers of neoconservatism" were "former liberals or leftists." More recently, they have been joined by "realists, newly mugged by reality" such as [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Richard Cheney]], and [[George W. Bush]], who "have given weight to neoconservatism, making it more diverse and, given the newcomers' past experience, more mature."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In a 2008 column entitled "[[Charlie Gibson]]'s Gaffe", Krauthammer elaborated on the changing meanings of the [[Bush Doctrine]] in light of Gibson's questioning of Republican vice-presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] regarding what exactly the Bush Doctrine was, which resulted in criticism of Palin's response. Krauthammer states that the phrase originally referred to "the unilateralism that characterized the pre-9/11 first year of the Bush administration," but elaborates, "There is no single meaning of the Bush doctrine. In fact, there have been four distinct meanings, each one succeeding another over the eight years of this administration."<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202457.html "Charlie Gibson's Gaffe"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213095318/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202457.html |date=February 13, 2011 }} By Charles Krauthammer, ''The Washington Post'', September 13, 2008.</ref>

====Israel====
Krauthammer strongly opposed the [[Oslo accords]] and said that [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] leader [[Yasir Arafat]] would use the foothold it gave him in the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] to continue the war against Israel that he had ostensibly renounced in the [[Israel–Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition]]. In a July 2006 essay in ''Time'', Krauthammer wrote that the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] was fundamentally defined by the Palestinians' unwillingness to accept compromise.<ref>{{cite magazine|last = Krauthammer|first = Charles|title = Remember What Happened Here|magazine = Time|volume = 168|issue = 2|date = July 10, 2006|page = 76|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1209965,00.html|access-date = September 6, 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430102107/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1209965,00.html|archive-date = April 30, 2009|url-status = live}}</ref>

During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Krauthammer wrote a column, "Let Israel Win the War": "What other country, when attacked in an unprovoked aggression across a recognized international frontier, is then put on a countdown clock by the world, given a limited time window in which to fight back, regardless of whether it has restored its own security?"<ref>[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/07/lost_moral_bearings.html "Let Israel Win the War"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218201134/http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/07/lost_moral_bearings.html |date=December 18, 2007 }} by Charles Krauthammer, www.realclearpolitics.com, July 28, 2006.</ref> He later criticized Israeli prime minister [[Ehud Olmert]]'s conduct, arguing that Olmert "has provided unsteady and uncertain leadership. Foolishly relying on air power alone, he denied his generals the ground offensive they wanted, only to reverse himself later."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/03/AR2006080301258.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Israel's Lost Moment|first=Charles|last=Krauthammer|date=August 4, 2006|access-date=April 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515192949/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/03/AR2006080301258.html|archive-date=May 15, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Krauthammer supported a [[two-state solution]] to the conflict. Unlike many conservatives, he supported Israel's [[Gaza withdrawal]] as a step toward rationalizing the frontiers between Israel and a future [[Palestinian state]].

When [[Richard Goldstone]] retracted the claim 1 1/2 years after the issuance of the [[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|UN report on the 2008 Gaza war]] that Israel intentionally killed Palestinian civilians,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/world/middleeast/03goldstone.html|title=Richard Goldstone Regrets Saying Israel Purposely Killed Gazans|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 2, 2011|first1=Ethan|last1=Bronner|first2=Isabel|last2=Kershner|access-date=August 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619125658/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/world/middleeast/03goldstone.html|archive-date=June 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> including children, Krauthammer strongly criticized Goldstone, saying that "this weasel-y excuse-laden retraction is too little and too late" and called "the original report a [[blood libel]] ranking with the libels of the 19th century in which Jews were accused of ritually slaughtering children in order to use the blood in rituals." Krauthammer thought that Goldstone "should spend the rest of his life undoing the damage and changing and retracting that report."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.jewishpress.com/news/obituaries/conservative-commentator-charles-krauthammer-dead-at-68/2018/06/22/|title=Conservative Commentator Charles Krauthammer Dead at 68|work=The Jewish Press|date=June 22, 2018|access-date=October 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028221150/https://www.jewishpress.com/news/obituaries/conservative-commentator-charles-krauthammer-dead-at-68/2018/06/22/|archive-date=October 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

====9/11, Iraq, and the War on Terror====
Krauthammer laid out the underlying principle of strategic necessity restraining democratic idealism in his controversial 2004 [[Irving Kristol Award|Kristol Award]] Lecture: "We will support democracy everywhere, but we will commit blood and treasure only in places where there is a strategic necessity—meaning, places central to the larger war against the existential enemy, the enemy that poses a global mortal threat to freedom."<ref name=autogenerated1 />

The 9/11 attacks, Krauthammer wrote, made clear the new existential threat and the necessity for a new interventionism. On September 12, 2001, he wrote that, if the suspicion that [[bin Laden]] was behind the attack proved correct, the United States had no choice but to go to war in Afghanistan.<ref>[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/krauthammer091201.asp "This Is Not a Crime, This is War"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182731/http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/krauthammer091201.asp |date=September 30, 2007 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''The Washington Post'', September 12, 2001.</ref> He supported the Second Iraq War on the "realist" grounds of the strategic threat the Saddam regime posed to the region as UN sanctions were eroding and of his alleged [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] and on the "idealist" grounds that a self-sustaining democracy in Iraq would be a first step toward changing the poisonous political culture of tyranny, intolerance, and religious fanaticism in the Arab world that had incubated the anti-American extremism from which 9/11 emerged.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In October 2002, he presented what he believed were the primary arguments for and against the war, writing, "Hawks favor war on the grounds that [[Saddam Hussein]] is reckless, tyrannical, and instinctively aggressive, and that if he comes into possession of [[nuclear weapons]] in addition to the weapons of mass destruction he already has, he is likely to use them or share them with [[terrorists]]. The threat of mass death on a scale never before seen residing in the hands of an unstable madman is intolerable—and must be [[preemptive war|preempted]]. Doves oppose war on the grounds that the risks exceed the gains. War with Iraq could be very costly, possibly degenerating into [[urban warfare]]."

He continued:
"I happen to believe that the [[preemptive war|preemption school]] is correct, that the risks of allowing Saddam Hussein to acquire his weapons will only grow with time. Nonetheless, I can both understand and respect those few Democrats who make the principled argument against war with Iraq on the grounds of [[deterrence theory|deterrence]], believing that safety lies in reliance on a proven (if perilous) balance of terror rather than the risky innovation of forcible disarmament by preemption."<ref>[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/krauthammer100702.asp "What Good Is Delay?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070215095047/http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/krauthammer100702.asp |date=February 15, 2007 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''[[Jewish World Review]]'', October 7, 2002.</ref>

On the eve of the invasion, Krauthammer wrote, "Reformation and reconstruction of an alien culture are a daunting task. Risky and, yes, arrogant."<ref>{{cite magazine|last = Krauthammer|first = Charles|title = Coming Ashore|magazine = Time|volume = 161|issue = 7|date = February 17, 2003|page = 37|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1004236-1,00.html|access-date = September 6, 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120108054911/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1004236-1,00.html|archive-date = January 8, 2012|url-status = live}}</ref> In February 2003, Krauthammer cautioned that "it may yet fail. But we cannot afford not to try. There is not a single, remotely plausible, alternative strategy for attacking the monster behind 9/11. It's not Osama bin Laden; it is the cauldron of political oppression, religious intolerance, and social ruin in the Arab-Islamic world—oppression transmuted and deflected by regimes with no legitimacy into virulent, murderous [[anti-Americanism]]."<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Krauthammer in 2003 wrote that the [[reconstruction of Iraq]] would provide many benefits for the Iraqi people, once the political and economic infrastructure destroyed by Saddam was restored: "With its oil, its urbanized middle class, its educated population, its essential modernity, Iraq has a future. In two decades Saddam Hussein reduced its GDP by 75 percent. Once its political and industrial infrastructures are reestablished, Iraq's potential for rebound, indeed for explosive growth, is unlimited."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/CharlesKrauthammer/2003/09/19/democrats_and_nation_building|title=Democrats and Nation-Building|first=Charles|last=Krauthammer|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 19, 2003|access-date=July 20, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919232458/http://townhall.com/columnists/CharlesKrauthammer/2003/09/19/democrats_and_nation_building|archive-date=September 19, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a speech to the [[Foreign Policy Association]] in Philadelphia, he argued that the beginnings of [[democratization in the Arab world]] had been met in 2006 with a "fierce counterattack" by radical [[Islamist]] forces in [[Lebanon]], [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]], and especially Iraq, which witnessed a major intensification in sectarian warfare.<ref>[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/12/past_the_apogee_america_under.html Past the Apogee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206040924/http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/12/past_the_apogee_america_under.html |date=December 6, 2016 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''[[Foreign Policy Research Institute]]'', December 2006.</ref> In late 2006 and 2007, he was one of the few commentators to support the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|troop surge in Iraq]].<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/14/AR2006121401367.html "In Baker's Blunder, a Chance for Bush"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302063553/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/14/AR2006121401367.html |date=March 2, 2017 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''The Washington Post'', December 5, 2006.</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/12/AR2007041201823.html "The Surge: First Fruits"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522162009/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/12/AR2007041201823.html |date=May 22, 2017 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''The Washington Post'', April 13, 2007.</ref>

In 2009, Krauthammer argued that the use of [[torture]] against enemy combatants was impermissible except in two contexts: (a) when "[an] innocent's life is at stake," "[the] bad guy you have captured possesses information that could save this life, [and he] refuses to divulge"; and (b) when torture may lead to "the extraction of information from a high-value enemy in possession of high-value information likely to save lives".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/30/AR2009043003108.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181216065350/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/30/AR2009043003108.html |archive-date=December 16, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/6/21/17490816/charles-krauthammer-dies-obituary|title=Charles Krauthammer was the anti-Breitbart conservative writer|work=Vox|access-date=2018-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622220315/https://www.vox.com/2018/6/21/17490816/charles-krauthammer-dies-obituary|archive-date=June 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>"Charles Krauthammer."

===Ideology===
[[Meg Greenfield]], editorial page editor for ''The Washington Post'' who edited Krauthammer's columns for 15 years, called his weekly column "independent and hard to peg politically. It's a very tough column. There's no '[[trendy]]' in it. You never know what is going to happen next."<ref name="wpwg" /> [[Hendrik Hertzberg]], also a former colleague of Krauthammer while they worked at ''The New Republic'' in the 1980s, said that when the two first met in 1978, Krauthammer was "70 percent [[Walter Mondale|Mondale]] liberal, 30 percent '[[Henry M. Jackson|Scoop Jackson]] Democrat,' that is, hard-line on Israel and relations with the Soviet Union"; in the mid-1980s, he was still "50–50: fairly liberal on economic and social questions but a full-bore foreign-policy neoconservative." Hertzberg in 2009 called Krauthammer a "pretty solid 90–10 Republican."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/hendrikhertzberg/2009/03/krauthammer-the.html |title=Krauthammer Then and Now |access-date=March 18, 2009 |last=Herzberg |first=Hendrik |author-link=Hendrik Herzberg |date=March 2, 2009 |work=The New Yorker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309003854/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/hendrikhertzberg/2009/03/krauthammer-the.html |archive-date=March 9, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Krauthammer was described by some as having been a [[American conservatism|conservative]].<ref name="Beinert NYT">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/magazine/30liberal.html?_r=2&pagewanted=print|title=The Rehabilitation of the Cold-War Liberal|last=Beinart|first=Peter|date=April 30, 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 31, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512095735/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/magazine/30liberal.html?_r=2&pagewanted=print|archive-date=May 12, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last = Bill|first = Steigerwald|title = So, what is a 'neocon'?|publisher = Pittsburgh Tribune|date = May 29, 2004|url = http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_196286.html|access-date = April 8, 2009|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090215135620/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_196286.html|archive-date = February 15, 2009}}</ref>

===Presidential elections===
A few days before the [[2012 United States presidential election]], Krauthammer predicted it would be "very close" with Republican candidate [[Mitt Romney]] winning the "popular [vote] by, I think, about half a point, Electoral College probably a very narrow margin."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/1943688188001|title=Hannity (segment)|work=FNC Video|publisher=Foxnews.com|date=November 3, 2012|access-date=May 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511081333/http://video.foxnews.com/v/1943688188001/|archive-date=May 11, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Although admitting his incorrect prediction, Krauthammer maintained, "Obama won but had no mandate.

Before the 2016 presidential election, Krauthammer stated that "I will not vote for [[Hillary Clinton]], but, as I’ve explained in my columns, I could never vote for [[Donald Trump]]".<ref name=vote>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/my-vote-explained/2016/10/20/b61442a4-96f2-11e6-bc79-af1cd3d2984b_story.html|title=My vote, explained|work=The Washington Post|date=October 20, 2016|access-date=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021123942/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/my-vote-explained/2016/10/20/b61442a4-96f2-11e6-bc79-af1cd3d2984b_story.html|archive-date=October 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

In July 2017 following the release by [[Donald Trump Jr.]] of the email chain about the [[Trump campaign–Russian meetings#Trump Tower meeting, June 9, 2016|Trump Tower]] meeting on June 9, 2016, Krauthammer opined that even bungled collusion is still collusion.<ref name=jr>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/14/media/charles-krauthammer-donald-trump-jr-collusion/index.html|title=Krauthammer calls it 'collusion'|work=[[CNN Money]]|date=July 14, 2017|access-date=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410121745/https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/14/media/charles-krauthammer-donald-trump-jr-collusion/index.html|archive-date=April 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=jrii>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bungled-collusion-is-still-collusion/2017/07/13/68c7f72a-67f3-11e7-8eb5-cbccc2e7bfbf_story.html|title=Bungled collusion is still collusion|work=The Washington Post|date=July 13, 2017|access-date=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609123510/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bungled-collusion-is-still-collusion/2017/07/13/68c7f72a-67f3-11e7-8eb5-cbccc2e7bfbf_story.html|archive-date=June 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Religion===
Krauthammer received a rigorous Jewish education. He attended a school where half the day was devoted to secular studies and half the day was devoted to religious education conducted in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. By the time he graduated from high school at the age of 16, Krauthammer was able to write philosophical essays in Hebrew. His father demanded that he learn [[Talmud]]; in addition to his school's required Talmud studies, Krauthammer took extra Talmud classes three days a week. This was not enough for his father who hired a [[rabbi]] to provide private instruction on the Talmud three nights a week.<ref name="Conversations1"/>

Krauthammer's attachment to [[Judaism]] was strengthened through his study of [[Maimonides]] at [[McGill University]] under [[David Hartman (rabbi)|Rabbi David Hartman]]. Krauthammer said, "I had discovered the world, and was going to leave all of this [Judaism] behind, because I was too sophisticated for it. And then in my third year I took Hartman’s course in Maimonides, and I’m thinking this is pretty serious stuff. It stands up to the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greeks]], stands up to the philosophers of the age, and it gave me sort of a renewed commitment to and respect for my own tradition, which I already knew, but was ready to throw away. And I didn’t throw it away as a result of that encounter."<ref name="Conversations1"/>

Krauthammer stated that "[[atheism]] is the least plausible of all theologies. I mean, there are a lot of wild ones out there, but the one that clearly runs so contrary to what is possible, is atheism".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burk|first=Denny|title=The Theology of Charles Krauthammer|url=http://www.dennyburk.com/the-theology-of-charles-krauthammer-via-rjmoeller-dennisprager/|access-date=January 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115010421/http://www.dennyburk.com/the-theology-of-charles-krauthammer-via-rjmoeller-dennisprager/|archive-date=January 15, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Krauthammer opposed the [[Park51]] project in [[Manhattan]] for "reasons of common decency and respect for the sacred. No commercial tower over [[Gettysburg National Military Park|Gettysburg]], no [[convent]] at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], and no [[mosque]] at [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]]. Build it anywhere but there."<ref>{{cite web|title=Build the mosque anywhere but Ground Zero|author=Krauthammer, Charles|date=August 12, 2010|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/08/13/2010-08-13_build_it_anywhere_but_here.html#ixzz11h3ylplN|work=[[New York Daily News]]|access-date=October 7, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819024759/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/08/13/2010-08-13_build_it_anywhere_but_here.html#ixzz11h3ylplN|archive-date=August 19, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Supreme Court nominations===
Krauthammer criticized President George W. Bush's 2005 nomination of [[Harriet Miers]] to succeed [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. He called the nomination of Miers a "mistake" on several occasions. He noted her lack of constitutional experience as the main obstacle to her nomination.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

On October 21, 2005, Krauthammer published "Miers: The Only Exit Strategy",<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/20/AR2005102001635.html "Miers: The Only Exit Strategy"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010170345/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/20/AR2005102001635.html |date=October 10, 2017 }} by Charles Krauthammer, ''The Washington Post'', October 12, 2006.</ref> in which he explained that all of Miers's relevant constitutional writings are protected by both [[attorney–client privilege]] and [[executive privilege]], which presented a unique face-saving solution to the mistake: "Miers withdraws out of respect for both the Senate and the executive's prerogatives."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-10_21_05_CK.html|title=Commentary – An Exit Strategy for the Miers Debacle by Charles Krauthammer|publisher=RealClearPolitics|date=October 21, 2005|access-date=March 10, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109012735/http://realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-10_21_05_CK.html|archive-date=January 9, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Six days later, Miers withdrew, employing that argument:
