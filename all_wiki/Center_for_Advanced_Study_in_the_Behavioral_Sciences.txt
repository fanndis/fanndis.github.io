The '''Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences''' ('''CASBS''') is an [[interdisciplinary]] research lab at [[Stanford University]] that offers a residential postdoctoral fellowship program for scientists and scholars studying "the five core social and behavioral disciplines of [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.casbs.org/history|title = History|access-date = 21 June 2014|publisher = Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140808235002/http://www.casbs.org/history|archive-date = 8 August 2014}}</ref><ref>[[Debora Hammond]] (2003).

It has 54 studies, meeting rooms, a conference hall, a kitchen, and dining room with a private chef.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://www.casbs.org/facilities|title = Facilities|access-date = 21 June 2014|publisher = CASBS|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140810040858/http://www.casbs.org/facilities|archive-date = 10 August 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
The Center was founded in 1954 by the [[Ford Foundation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.casbs.org/early-years-and-mission|title = The Early Years and Mission|access-date = 21 June 2014|publisher = Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811010850/http://www.casbs.org/early-years-and-mission|archive-date = 11 August 2014}}</ref> The American educator [[Ralph W. Tyler]] served as the center's first director from 1954 to 1966.<ref>Alasdair A. MacDonald, A. H. Huussen (2004). ''Scholarly environments: centres of learning and institutional contexts, 1560-1960''. Peeters Publishers, p.173</ref> The CASBS buildings were designed by [[William Wurster]], a local architect.<ref name=":0" />

Earlier, fellow selection was a closed process; new fellows were nominated by former fellows. However, since 2007, the center opened up the fellow selection process to applications. In 2008 it became officially part of [[Stanford University]] and reports to the [[Stanford University centers and institutes|Vice-Provost and Dean of Research]].<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://news.stanford.edu/news/2008/april9/casbs-040908.html|title = Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences Seeks fellowship applications|date = 9 April 2008|work = Stanford Report}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/centerslaboratoriesandinstitutes/#researchtext|title=Centers, Laboratories, and Institutes - Stanford University|website=exploredegrees.stanford.edu}}</ref>

== Fellows ==
Each class of fellows numbers about 40 people. In the first 40 years of its existence it supported about 2,000 scientists and scholars.<ref>Stanford University News Service (415) 723-2558, [http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/94/940228Arc4425.html Ralph Tyler, one of century's foremost educators, dies at 91 ]</ref>
