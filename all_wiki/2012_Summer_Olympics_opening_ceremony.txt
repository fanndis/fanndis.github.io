The [[Olympic opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] took place on the evening of Friday 27 July 2012 in the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]], [[London]], during which the Games were formally opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. As mandated by the [[Olympic Charter]], the proceedings combined the ceremonial opening of this international sporting event (including welcoming speeches, hoisting of the flags and the parade of athletes) with an artistic spectacle to showcase the host nation's culture.  The spectacle was entitled '''''Isles of Wonder'''''<ref>{{cite web |title= Isles of Wonder |url=http://olympicopeningceremony.tumblr.com/tagged/stage1 |date=27 July 2012 |access-date=29 July 2012}}</ref> and directed by [[Academy Award]]-winning British film director [[Danny Boyle]].

Prior to London 2012 there had been considerable apprehension about [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s ability to stage an opening ceremony that could reach the standard set at the [[Beijing]] [[2008 Summer Olympics|Summer Games of 2008]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Engineering the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/in-depth/the-big-story/engineering-the-london-2012-olympics-opening-ceremony/1013640.article|work=The Negineer|first=Stephen|last=Harris|date=23 August 2012|access-date=24 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=London 2012 cannot match Beijing Olympics opening ceremony 'because of trade unions'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/2617980/London-2012-cannot-match-Beijing-Olympics-opening-ceremony-because-of-trade-unions.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Richard|last=Spencer|date=25 August 2012|access-date=24 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Five Ways for London to Top the Beijing Olympics Opening Ceremony|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/philip-hepple/london-2012-olympics-five-ways-to-top-beijing-opening-ceremony_b_1282811.html?ref=uk|work=Huffington Post|first=Philip|last=Hepple|date=16 February 2012|access-date=24 August 2012}}</ref> The [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2008 ceremony]] had been noted for its scale, extravagance and expense, hailed as the "greatest ever",<ref name="AFPGreatestEver">{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ibNAUAq-kZNOy3LmO9HAI2cN-smg |title=Press hails 'greatest ever' Olympic opening show |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=9 August 2008 |access-date=13 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511131508/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ibNAUAq-kZNOy3LmO9HAI2cN-smg |archivedate=11 May 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> and had cost £65m.

==Preparations==
The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games ([[LOCOG]]) approached [[Danny Boyle]] to be the director of the ceremony in June 2010, and he immediately accepted.<ref name=QNov2012>{{Citation | last = Lynskey | first = Dorian |  title = Oblivion with Bells | journal = [[Q (magazine)|Q]] | volume = 318 | pages = 82–88 | date = January 2013|origyear=published November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Danny Boyle to direct London 2012 opening ceremony|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/7199.aspx|work=Gov.uk|date=22 June 2010|access-date=24 August 2012}}</ref> Boyle explained that there had been four things that made him take the job: he was a big Olympics fan, he lived a mile from the Stadium and so felt invested in the area, his late father's birthday was on the ceremony's date, and he felt his 'Oscar clout' would enable him to push through what he wanted to do.<ref>{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's journey from truck driving to the Olympics |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schoolreport/21741278 |work=BBC |date=11 March 2013 |access-date=13 March 2013}}</ref> He said it "felt weirdly more like a ... civic or national responsibility" to take the job.<ref name=GDBCotP>{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle: champion of the people |first=Jonathan |last=Freedland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/09/danny-boyle-queen-olympics-film |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 March 2013 |access-date=13 March 2013}}</ref>

Boyle acknowledged that the extravagance of the 2008 opening ceremony was an impossible act to follow — "you can't get bigger than Beijing" — and that this realisation had in fact liberated his team creatively. He said "..obviously I'm not going to try and build on Beijing, because how could you? We can't, and you wouldn't want to, so we're going back to the beginning. We're going to try and give the impression that we're rethinking and restarting, because they've (''opening ceremonies'') escalated since Los Angeles in 1984.

The different sections of the ceremony were designed to reflect aspects of British history and culture, with the title ''Isles of Wonder'' partly inspired by [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]'' (particularly Caliban's 'Be not afeard' speech<ref name="IoWDT">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/olympicsvideo/9044505/London-2012-Olympics-Shakespeares-Caliban-the-inspiration-for-Isles-of-Wonder-opening-ceremony.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|title=London 2012 Olympics: Shakespeare's Caliban the inspiration for 'Isles of Wonder' opening ceremony|date=27 July 2012|access-date=21 March 2013}}</ref>), and partly by the [[G.

In July 2010, Boyle started brainstorming ideas with designer [[Mark Tildesley (production designer)|Mark Tildesley]], writer [[Frank Cottrell-Boyce]] and costume designer [[Suttirat Anne Larlarb]]. They considered "what was essentially British", with the non-British Larlarb able to offer a view of what the world thought Britain meant. Cottrell-Boyce had given Boyle a copy of ''[[Pandaemonium (history book)|Pandaemonium]]'', (named after the capital of Hell in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'') by [[Humphrey Jennings]], which collated contemporary reports from the [[industrial revolution]].<ref name=QNov2012/><ref name="GdnFCB"/><ref name=Jennings>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/06/pandaemonium-humphrey-jennings-review |title=Pandæmonium by Humphrey Jennings – review The book behind the Olympic opening ceremony |first=Nicholas| last=Lezard|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 October 2012 |access-date=25 November 2012}}</ref> It had become traditional during the opening ceremony to 'produce' the [[Olympic symbols#The Rings|Olympic rings]] in a spectacular manner. Cottrell-Boyce commented "Danny had a very clear idea that in the first 15 minutes you had to have a great, startling image that could go around the world; it had to climax with something that made people go 'Oh my God!'".  Boyle decided that "the journey from the pastoral to the industrial, ending with the forging of the Olympic rings" would be that image.<ref name=QNov2012/>

The ten distinct chapters on which the team started work were gradually compressed into three principal movements: the violent transition from 'Green and Pleasant Land' to the 'Pandemonium' of industrial revolution, a salute to the NHS and children's literature, and a celebration of pop culture, technology and the digital revolution.<ref name=QNov2012/>

{{quote box|quote="At some point in their histories, most nations experience a revolution that changes everything about them. The United Kingdom had a revolution that changed the whole of human existence.

In 1709 [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]] smelted iron in a blast furnace, using [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. And so began the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Out of [[Coalbrookdale|Abraham's Shropshire furnace]] flowed molten metal. Out of his genius flowed the mills, looms, engines, weapons, railways, ships, cities, conflicts and prosperity that built the world we live in.

In November 1990 another Briton sparked another revolution – equally far-reaching – a revolution we're still experiencing. The digital revolution was sparked by [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s amazing gift to the world – the [[World Wide Web]]. This, he said, is for everyone.

We welcome you to an Olympic Opening Ceremony for everyone. A ceremony that celebrates the creativity, eccentricity, daring and openness of the British genius by harnessing the genius, creativity, eccentricity, daring and openness of modern London.

You'll hear the words of our great poets – [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[William Blake|Blake]] and [[John Milton|Milton]]. You'll hear the glorious noise of our unrivalled pop culture. You'll see characters from our great children's literature – [[Peter Pan]] and [[Captain Hook]], [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]], [[Voldemort]], [[Cruella de Vil]]. You'll see ordinary families and extraordinary athletes. Dancing nurses, singing children and amazing special effects.

But we hope, too, that through all the noise and excitement that you will glimpse a single golden thread of purpose – the idea of [[Jerusalem (hymn)|Jerusalem]] – of a better world, the world of real freedom and true equality, a world that can be built through the prosperity of industry, through the caring nation that built the welfare state, through the joyous energy of popular culture, through the dream of universal communication. A belief that we can build Jerusalem.  And that it will be for everyone."|source=Danny Boyle, in the ceremony programme.<ref name=Intro>{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's intro on Olympics programme |url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |publisher=Awards Daily |first=Ryan |last=Adams |date=27 July 2012 |access-date=7 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206135250/http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |archive-date=6 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>|width=25%|align=right}}

When Boyle returned to work on the ceremony in the spring of 2011 he asked [[Rick Smith (Underworld)|Rick Smith]] of [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]], with whom he had worked on several film projects as well as his [[Frankenstein (2011 play)|theatrical production]] of [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', to be the musical director.<ref name=QNov2012/><ref name="baltin1">{{cite news |title=Underworld Named Music Directors of 2012 Olympics|first=Steve |last=Baltin |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/underworld-named-music-directors-of-2012-olympics-20111208 |work=Rolling Stone |date=8 December 2011 |access-date=29 July 2012}}</ref> At the same time the team moved to the [[Three Mills]] studio complex in east London, where a 4x4 metre scale model of the stadium was built. For security reasons, a single CGI-assisted version of the ceremony was kept on editor Sascha Dhillon's laptop; anyone needing it had to come to the studio.<ref name=QNov2012/>

The cast included professional performers and 7,500 volunteers.<ref>{{citation | title=Volunteers |work= London 2012|url=http://www.london2012.com/mm/Document/Documents/General/01/30/27/74/OOCVolunteers_Neutral.pdf|date= 19 July 2019}}</ref> Boyle considered the volunteers to be "the most valuable commodity of all". In November 2011 they auditioned at Three Mills, and rehearsals began in earnest in spring 2012 at an open-air site at [[Dagenham]] (the abandoned [[Ford Dagenham|Ford]] plant), often in foul weather. Although key contributors had to sign non-disclosure agreements and some elements were codenamed, Boyle placed immense trust in the volunteers by asking them simply to "save the surprise" and not leak any information.<ref name=QNov2012/><ref name=GDBCotP/> Further volunteers were recruited to help with security and marshalling, and to support the technical crew.<ref name=GDBF/><ref>{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle hails 15,000 Olympics opening ceremony volunteers |first1=Wesley |last=Johnson|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/danny-boyle-hails-15000-olympics-opening-ceremony-volunteers-7982152.html |work=The Independent |date=27 January 2012 |access-date=29 July 2012}}</ref> Three weeks before the ceremony, [[Mark Rylance]], who was to have taken a leading part, pulled out after a family bereavement and was replaced by [[Kenneth Branagh]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Young British athletes light cauldron at Olympics Opening Ceremony |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/olympics/906568-young-british-athletes-light-cauldron-at-olympics-opening-ceremony#ixzz226AYmCK1 |newspaper=Metro |first=Julian|last=Shea|date=27 July 2012 |access-date=30 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Kenneth Branagh recalls the opening ceremony of London 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/dec/23/kenneth-branagh-danny-boyle-olympics |newspaper=The Observer|first=Kenneth|last=Branagh|date=23 December 2012 |access-date=23 December 2012}}</ref>

Boyle gave significant emphasis to the London 2012 theme 'inspire a generation' and devised a programme relying heavily on children and young people, and built around themes that would relate to the young.  25 schools in the six original East London host boroughs were used to recruit child volunteers for the performance, and 170 sixth formers (16–18-year-olds), between them speaking more than 50 languages, were recruited from their colleges.

On 12 June 2012 at a press conference, Boyle had promised a huge set of rural [[Great Britain|Britain]], which was to include a [[village cricket]] team, farm animals, a model of [[Glastonbury Tor]], as well as a [[maypole]] and a rain-producing cloud. His intention was to represent the rural and urban [[landscape]] of Britain. The design was to include a mosh pit at each end of the set, one with people celebrating a [[rock festival]] and the other the [[The Proms|Last Night of the Proms]].

Boyle promised a ceremony with which everyone would feel involved; he said, "I hope it will reveal how peculiar and contrary we are – and how there's also, I hope, a warmth about us." Some of the set was designed with real grass turf and soil.<ref>{{cite news |title=Olympic opening ceremony will recreate countryside with real animals |first=Owen |last=Gibson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremony |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 June 2012 |access-date=27 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=London 2012 opening ceremony promises spectacle and surprises |first=Charlotte |last=Higgins |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-opening-ceremony-spectacle?intcmp=239 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 June 2012 |access-date=27 July 2012}}</ref> The use of animals (40 sheep, 12 horses, 3 cows, 2 goats, 10 chickens, 10 ducks, 9 geese and 3 sheep dogs, looked after by 34 animal handlers) drew some criticism from [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)]].

The overwhelming majority of the music used was British.

[[Sebastian Coe, Baron Coe|Sebastian Coe]] was instrumental in asking the Queen to take part, responding positively when Boyle first pitched the ''Happy and Glorious'' film sequence featuring the Queen.  Boyle suggested that the Queen be played either a lookalike, or by a world-class actress such as [[Helen Mirren]], in a location to double as Buckingham Palace.  Coe asked [[Princess Anne]], a [[List of members of the International Olympic Committee|British member of the IOC]] and [[LOCOG]], what she thought, and she told him to ask the Queen.  Coe presented the idea to the Queen's Deputy Private Secretary.<ref>''Our Queen'', documentary film, first broadcast on ITV on 17 March 2013.</ref> Boyle was surprised to hear that the Queen would be happy to play herself, and wanted a speaking part.<ref name=GDBCotP/> Filming took place in late March 2012, and ''Happy and Glorious'' was produced by the BBC, as was the opening film sequence ''Journey along the Thames''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19018666|title=How James Bond whisked the Queen to the Olympics|date=27 July 2012|access-date=19 October 2012|first=Nicolas|last=Brown|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

===Prologue===
[[File:2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony (18).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Scene before the ceremony commenced, representing rural Britain]]
At exactly 20:12 (8:12 pm) the [[Red Arrows]] performed a flypast over the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]] and then over the concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].<ref name="flypast">{{cite news |title=London 2012: Red Arrows Perform Stunning Fly-By Before Olympic Opening Ceremony |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/07/27/london-2012-red-arrows-olympics_n_1711429.html |work=Huffington Post |date=28 July 2012 |access-date=28 July 2012}}</ref> This concert featured artists selected to represent the four nations of the United Kingdom: [[Duran Duran]], [[Stereophonics]], [[Snow Patrol]] and [[Paolo Nutini]].<ref name="hydeshow">{{cite news |title=Hyde Park show kicks off Olympics |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19014489 |work=BBC News |date=27 July 2012 |access-date=10 August 2012}}</ref>

At the beginning the stadium contained a rural scene including the model of [[Glastonbury Tor]], a model village and a water wheel, replete with live animals (removed shortly before the ceremony began), and actors portraying working villagers, football and cricket players.

[[Frank Turner]] performed three songs ("Sailor's Boots", "Wessex Boy" and "[[I Still Believe (Frank Turner song)|I Still Believe]]") on the model of [[Glastonbury Tor]], joined by [[Emily Barker]], [[Ben Marwood]] and Jim Lockey, as well as his regular backing band the Sleeping Souls.<ref name="frankturner">{{cite news |title=THE BEST OF 2012: AN OLYMPIC STORY BY FRANK TURNER! |url=http://www.rocksound.tv/blog/article/the-event-that-shall-not-be-named-an-olympic-story-by-frank-turner |work=Rock Sound |first=Frank|last=Turner|date=27 December 2012 |access-date=8 August 2012}}</ref> [[London Symphony Orchestra|LSO]] On Track (an orchestra of 80 young musicians from ten East London boroughs together with 20 LSO members) then performed [[Edward Elgar]]'s "[[Enigma Variations#Variation IX (Adagio) "Nimrod"|Nimrod]]" from the ''[[Enigma Variations]]'', accompanied by extracts from the [[BBC Radio]] ''[[Shipping Forecast]]'', and maritime images on the big screens, while the audience held up blue sheeting to simulate the sight of the ocean. This performance celebrated Britain's maritime heritage and geographical insularity.

===Countdown <small>(21:00–21:04 BST)</small>===
The ceremony began at 9pm after a one-minute '60 to 1' countdown film made up of shots of numbers, such as those on house doors, street nameplates, [[London Buses|London buses]] and market labels.

[[File:Bradley Wiggins 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|The [[2012 Tour de France]] winner [[Bradley Wiggins]] opening the ceremony]]

A two-minute film ''Journey along the Thames'', directed by Boyle and produced by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], opened the ceremony.<ref>{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's Olympic opening ceremony: madcap, surreal and moving |first=Owen |last=Gibson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/olympic-opening-ceremony?newsfeed=true |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 July 2012 |access-date=28 July 2012}}</ref> To the sound of "Surf Solar" by [[Fuck Buttons]], it followed the [[River Thames]] from its [[Thames Head|source]] to the heart of London, juxtaposing images of contemporary British life with pastoral shots and flashes of scenes from the stadium. The characters Ratty, Mole and Toad from ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' were briefly seen, as was a '[[Monty Python]] hand' pointing towards London on umbrellas, and an [[InterCity 125]] train passing the Olympic rings as [[crop circle]]s in a field. At [[Battersea Power Station]] a [[Pink Floyd pigs|Pink Floyd pig]] was flying between the towers; the clock sound from another Pink Floyd song "[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]" was heard passing [[Big Ben#Tower|Big Ben]]. The soundtrack included clips from the theme tune of ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', "[[London Calling (song)|London Calling]]" by [[The Clash]], and the [[Sex Pistols]]' "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" as the film followed the route of the band's infamous cruise down the River [[Thames]] during the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]].<ref name="xan">{{cite news |title=London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony – as it happened |first=Xan |last=Brooks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/jul/27/london-2012-olympics-opening-ceremony-live |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 July 2012 |access-date=28 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=nmeplaylist>{{cite news |title=Olympics Opening Ceremony – The Playlist |first=Luke |last=Lewis |url=https://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=1&title=olympics_opening_ceremony_playlist&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 |newspaper=NME |date=27 July 2012 |access-date=28 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730224414/http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=1&title=olympics_opening_ceremony_playlist&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 |archive-date=30 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

After lifting to an aerial view of [[East London]] mirroring the title sequence of the BBC soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', to the sound of the drum beats from [[EastEnders theme tune|the closing theme]], the film flashed down through the [[Thames Barrier]], into Bow Creek, and then below surface through a [[London Underground]] train and station, historic footage of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s [[Thames Tunnel]], and through the [[Rotherhithe Tunnel]]. It then switched to a sequence filmed outside the stadium shortly before the ceremony, superimposed with posters from previous Summer Olympics (all of them except [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris]], [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin]], [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles]], and [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta]]), to a recording of "[[Map of the Problematique]]" by [[Muse (band)|Muse]]. This ended with a live shot of three cast members holding the posters for the 2012 competition.

There was then a ten-second countdown in the stadium, with children holding clusters of [[balloon]]s that burst simultaneously (although one set failed to burst), with the audience shouting out the numbers. [[Bradley Wiggins]], who had won the [[2012 Tour de France|Tour de France]] five days earlier, opened the ceremony by ringing the [[Olympic Bell]] that hung at one end of the stadium.  Four [[weather balloon|upper-atmosphere balloons]] were released, each expected to carry a set of Olympic rings and a camera up to the mid-[[stratosphere]].

The depiction of rural life already in the arena was billed as "a reminder and a promise of a once and future better life". Youth choirs began [[a cappella]] performances of the informal anthems of the four nations of the UK: "[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]" (for [[England]], sung by a live choir in the stadium), "[[Danny Boy]]" (from the [[Giant's Causeway]] in [[Northern Ireland]]), "[[Flower of Scotland]]" (from [[Edinburgh Castle]] in [[Scotland]]), and "[[Cwm Rhondda|Bread of Heaven]]" (from [[Rhossili|Rhossili Beach]] in [[Wales]] – sung in English).<ref name="koreen">{{cite news|title=London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony live |first=Eric |last=Koreen |url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/07/27/london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremonies-live/ |newspaper=The National Post |date=27 June 2012 |access-date=28 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120806010159/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/07/27/london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremonies-live/ |archivedate=6 August 2012 }}</ref> These were inter-cut with footage of notable [[Rugby Union|Rugby Union Home Nations]]' [[Try (rugby)|tries]], England's winning [[drop goal]] from the [[2003 Rugby World Cup Final]], and live shots from the stadium.

As the last choir performance concluded, vintage [[London General Omnibus Company]] [[stagecoach]]es entered, carrying businessmen and early [[Business magnate|industrialist]]s in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Morning dress|dress]] and [[top hat]]s, led by [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel]]. The 50 men stepped down from the carriages and [[Surveying|surveyed the land]] approvingly. After walking onto the Glastonbury Tor, Brunel delivered [[Caliban]]'s "Be not afeard" speech, reflecting Boyle's introduction to the ceremony in the programme<ref>{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle Welcomes The World To London |first=Danny |last=Boyle |url=http://descrier.co.uk/uk/2012/07/london-2012-danny-boyle-welcomes-the-world-to-london/ |newspaper=The Descrier |date=28 July 2012 |access-date=28 July 2012}}</ref> and signifying an aspiration of new industry or a new era in Britain.  This anticipated the next section of the ceremony.

===Pandemonium <small>(21:09–21:25)</small>===
This section encapsulated British economic and social development from rural economy through the [[Industrial Revolution]] to the 1960s.

[[File:2012 Olympics opening ceremony, Industrial Revolution scene.jpg|thumb|left|Scene representing [[Life in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution|Industrial Britain]]. Rehearsal 23 July 2012 before the ceremony four days later.]]

Proceedings were suddenly interrupted by a loud shout, recorded by volunteers during the rehearsals, followed by drumming (the pre-recorded drumming amplified by 965 cast members drumming on inverted household buckets and bins),<ref>{{cite web |title=Volunteering for the greatest show on earth |url=http://www.ism.org/blog/article/volunteering_for_the_greatest_show_on_earth |publisher=Incorporated Society of Musicians |first=Laura|last=Hollands|date=28 August 2012|access-date=4 September 2012}}</ref> led by [[Evelyn Glennie]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Evelyn Glennie on the Olympics Opening Ceremony |url=http://tomtommag.com/2013/02/evelyn-glennie-on-the-olympics-opening-ceremony/|publisher=Tom Tom Magazine |date=14 February 2013|access-date=13 March 2013}}</ref> The three-tonne oak tree on top of the Glastonbury Tor lifted, and industrial workers emerged from both the Tor's brightly lit interior and the entrances to the stadium, to swell the cast to a total of 2,500 volunteers.<ref name=QNov2012/> So began what Boyle had called the "biggest scene change in theatre history" and something he had been advised against attempting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Among those dark satanic mills|url=http://www.sean.co.uk/a/london2012-opening-ceremony.shtm|first=Sean|last=McManus|access-date=24 August 2012}}</ref> [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]'s "[[And I Will Kiss]]" began to play, as the cast rolled away the grass and other rural props.

Seven smoking [[smoke stack|chimney stacks]] with accompanying [[steeplejack]]s rose from the ground, along with other industrial machinery: five [[beam engine]]s, six looms, a crucible and a water wheel (one of the few items left from the rural scene). Boyle said that this section celebrated the "tremendous potential" afforded by the advancements of the [[Victorian era]].<ref name="koreen"/> It also included a [[Moment of silence|minute's silence]] in remembrance of the loss of life of both [[World war|World Wars]], featuring British '[[Tommy Atkins|Tommies]]' and shots of [[Remembrance poppy|poppies]], during which the names of the [[Accrington Pals]] were shown on the stadium screens. Unprompted, members of the audience stood in respect during this segment.<ref name=DVDcomm>Danny Boyle and Frank Cottrell-Boyce, audio commentary track to the BBC DVD of the opening ceremony</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Unpredictable and inventive as the British themselves, this was the People's Opening Ceremony| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/london-2012-opening-ceremony-opinion-1176668 |work=[[Daily Mirror]]|first=Brian|last=Reade|date=28 July 2012|access-date=28 July 2013}}</ref>

Volunteers paraded around the stadium representing some of the groups that had changed the face of Britain: the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|woman's suffrage]] movement, the [[Jarrow Crusade]], the first [[Caribbean]] immigrants arriving in 1948 on board the ''[[MV Empire Windrush#West Indian immigrants|Empire Windrush]]'', a 1970s DJ float, the Nostalgia Steel Band, and [[The Beatles]] as they appeared on the cover of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.  Also included were real-life [[Chelsea Pensioners]], the [[Grimethorpe Colliery Band]], and a group of [[Pearly Kings and Queens]].
[[File:KOCIS Korea London Olympics TeamKorea 09 (7683501986).jpg|thumb|upright|The Olympic rings]]
Workers began [[casting]] an iron ring.  As the noise level and tension built, driven by the relentless rhythm of the music and the drumming, participants mimed repetitive mechanical movements associated with industrial processes such as [[loom|weaving]]. Four glowing orange rings gradually began to be carried high above the stadium toward its centre on overhead wires, and then the ring seemingly being cast and forged in the arena began to lift.  The five rings converged, still glowing and accompanied by steam and firework effects to give the impression that they were of hot metal.  When the five rings formed [[Olympic symbols#Symbol|the Olympic symbol]] above the stadium, they ignited and rained fire in silver and gold.  The image of the Olympic rings in flame became the iconic image of the ceremony, reproduced in newspapers and web stories around the world.<ref name="xan"/><ref name="DTPand">{{cite news |title=London 2012: How the might of the industrial revolution was created on stage|first=Patrick |last=Sawer |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/london-2012/9435386/London-2012-How-the-might-of-the-industrial-revolution-was-created-on-stage.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 July 2012 |access-date=7 February 2013}}</ref>

===Happy and Glorious <small>(21:25–21:35)</small>===
A short film directed by Boyle and produced by the [[BBC]], called ''Happy and Glorious'' (after a line in the [[God Save the Queen|national anthem]]), featured the character [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]], played by [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|current Bond actor]] [[Daniel Craig]], entering the front gate of [[Buckingham Palace]] in a [[Hackney carriage|London black cab]].  His entrance (accompanied by an arrangement of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s '[[Arrival of the Queen of Sheba|The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba]]') is noticed by Brazilian children (a nod to [[Rio de Janeiro]], which was to be the next [[2016 Summer Olympics|summer Games]] host city) in the throne room. Bond escorted [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] (who played herself, acknowledging Bond with the words, "Good evening, Mr Bond") out of the building and into a waiting [[AgustaWestland AW139]] helicopter. The film followed the helicopter across London, with shots of a cheering crowd on [[The Mall, London|The Mall]], [[Nelson's Column]], the [[Palace of Westminster]] with an animated [[Statue of Winston Churchill, Parliament Square|Winston Churchill statue]] in [[Parliament Square]], and of the Thames past the [[London Eye]], [[St Paul's Cathedral]], the financial district [[City of London]].

The helicopter then passed through [[Tower Bridge]], accompanied by the [[Dambusters March]]. The film finished with Bond and the Queen apparently jumping from a real helicopter live above the stadium, accompanied by the "[[James Bond Theme]]".<ref name="xan"/><ref name="bbc120712jb">{{cite news |first=Nic |last=Brown |publisher=BBC News |title=How James Bond whisked the Queen to the Olympics |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19018666 |date=27 July 2012 |access-date=28 July 2012}}</ref> The Queen and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], along with [[Jacques Rogge|Rogge]], were then introduced to the audience.  The Queen was wearing the same dress as in the film, as if she had just arrived with Bond.

The idea of the royal helicopter jump was first pitched by Director [[Danny Boyle]] to [[Sebastian Coe]], who loved it so much he took it to [[Edward Young (courtier)|Edward Young]], Private Secretary to the Queen, at Buckingham Palace in the summer of 2011. Young 'listened sagely, laughed, and promised to ask the boss'. Word came back to Coe that the Queen would love to take part. Young, Boyle and Coe agreed to keep the plan secret so as not to spoil the surprise.

For the scenes with the helicopter, the Queen was doubled by actress [[Julia McKenzie]],<ref>{{cite news |work=Guardian |title= London 2012: Danny Boyle thrills audiences with inventive Olympics opening ceremony |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-boyle-olympics-opening-ceremony | first1=Tracy| first2= Owen | last1=McVeigh| last2=Gibson|date=28 July 2012 |access-date=4 March 2013}}</ref> and for the parachute jump by [[BASE jumping|BASE jumper]] and [[stunt performer|stuntman]] [[Gary Connery]] wearing a dress, hat, jewellery and with a handbag.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title= London 2012 remembered: Gary Connery loved his Olympic skydiving entrance for opening ceremony |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/10205509/London-2012-remembered-Gary-Connery-loved-his-Olympic-skydiving-entrance-for-opening-cermony.html |date=27 July 2013 |access-date=27 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title= London 2012: 'Amazing' to be Queen's stunt double |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19031022 |date=28 July 2012 |access-date=29 July 2012}}</ref> Bond was played by [[Mark Sutton]].<ref>{{cite news |work=BBC News |title= Olympic Bond parachutist Mark Sutton killed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23707434 |date=15 August 2014 |access-date=15 August 2013}}</ref> The helicopter had flown to the stadium from [[Stapleford Aerodrome]] in Essex, piloted by [[Marc Wolff]].

The Union Flag was then raised by members of the [[British Armed Forces]], while the first and third verses of the [[God Save the Queen|national anthem]] were performed ''[[a cappella]]'' by the [[Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children]].<ref name="koreen"/>

===Second to the right, and straight on till morning <small>(21:35–21:47)</small>===
The first part of this sequence celebrated the [[National Health Service]] ("the institution which more than any other unites our nation", according to the programme), which had been founded in the year of the previous London Games in 1948.  Music was by [[Mike Oldfield]]. 600 dancers, all of whom were NHS staff, along with 1,200 volunteers recruited from British hospitals, entered along with children on 320 hospital beds, some of which functioned as [[trampoline]]s.  They started a short jive routine. Watching from the tor were specially invited hospital staff and nine child patients from [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]].<ref name="GOSH">{{cite news |title=Incredible honour for Great Ormond Street Hospital at London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony |url=http://www.gosh.org/gen/news/latest-news/2012-archive/incredible-honour-for-great-ormond-street-hospital-at-london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremony/ |publisher=Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity |date=27 June 2012 |access-date=28 July 2012}}</ref> The blankets on the beds illuminated and the beds were arranged to depict a child's face with a smile and a tear (the Hospital Children's Charity's logo).  The acronym 'GOSH' then changed into the initials 'NHS', turning into the shape of a crescent moon as the children were hushed to sleep and read books by the nurses.

The sequence then moved on to celebrate [[Children's literature#United Kingdom|British children's literature]]. [[J. K. Rowling]] began by reading from [[James Matthew Barrie|J. M. Barrie]]'s ''[[Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up|Peter Pan]]'' (whose copyright was given to Great Ormond Street Hospital). The [[Child Catcher]] appeared amongst the children, followed by giant puppet representations of villains from British children's literature: [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the Queen of Hearts]], [[Captain Hook]], [[Cruella de Vil]] and [[Lord Voldemort]].  Minutes later, 32 women playing [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]] descended with their umbrellas, as the villains deflated and the actors resumed dancing.<ref name="xan"/> The music for this sequence included partially rearranged sections from ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' (with a giant set of [[tubular bells]] at the rear of the stage), ''[[Tubular Bells III]]'' and, after the villains had been driven away by the Mary Poppins characters, ''[[In Dulci Jubilo / On Horseback|In Dulci Jubilo]]''.<ref name="dizzee">{{cite news |title=Dizzee Rascal, Emeli Sandé, Mike Oldfield perform at Olympics opening ceremony |url=https://www.nme.com/news/dizzee-rascal/65184 |newspaper=NME |date=27 June 2012 |access-date=28 July 2012}}</ref> During this performance the children in pyjamas jumped up and down on their brightly lit beds, creating a memorable image amid the darkness of the stadium.

The sequence concluded with a pale, gigantic baby's head, with a rippling sheet for its body, in the centre of the arena.

[[Simon Rattle]] was then introduced to conduct the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in a performance of [[Vangelis]]'s "[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]", as a tribute to the British film industry. [[Rowan Atkinson]] appeared as a [[Mr. Bean]]-like character, comically playing a repeated note on a [[synthesiser]]. He then lapsed into a filmed dream sequence in which he joined the runners from the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', beating them in their iconic run along West Sands at [[St Andrews]] by riding in a car, rejoining the race and tripping the front runner. Danny Boyle later explained: "It wasn't actually Mr. Bean. Strictly speaking, the name of his character was Derek".<ref name=raphael>{{Cite book

The [[Great Storm of 1987|1987 "don't worry about a hurricane"]] weather forecast by [[Michael Fish]] was shown on the big screens as rain suddenly poured on the house, followed by "[[Push the Button (Sugababes song)|Push the Button]]", by [[Sugababes]]. In the centre of the arena the sides of another house, three times larger, were used as screens to show clips from various TV programmes, music videos and films, including ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (June is named for its protagonist), as well as ''[[Gregory's Girl]]'', ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'', ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', ''[[The Snowman]]'', ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'', ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', Spanish TV show ''[[Cuéntame cómo pasó]]'', and Boyle's own ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Olympic opening ceremony: Peter Bradshaw's review |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/olympic-opening-ceremony-review?newsfeed=true|newspaper=The Guardian| date=27 June 2012 |access-date=28 July 2012}}</ref> A large group of dancers, centred around Frankie and June (19-year-old Henrique Costa and 18-year-old Jasmine Breinburg) on a night out, performed to an assortment of British popular songs arranged broadly chronologically, beginning with "[[Going Underground]]" by [[The Jam]], suggesting a ride on the [[London Underground]]. During this track images of the Underground were projected onto the house and former London Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]] was briefly seen.  Throughout the sequence cast members were [[short message service|texting]] each other or placing [[social networking]] status updates on the [[Internet]]. Frankie and June first notice each other as a snippet from "[[Wonderful Tonight]]" by [[Eric Clapton]] plays, but when Frankie saw that June had dropped her phone on the Tube, he set off to return it (communicating using last number redial to her sister's phone).

[[File:This is for Everyone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s tweet, "This is for everyone"]]

An extended dance sequence followed, with songs including "[[My Generation]]" by [[The Who]], "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]" by the [[Rolling Stones]], "[[My Boy Lollipop]]" sung by [[Millie Small]], "[[All Day and All of the Night]]" by the [[Kinks]], "[[She Loves You]]" by the [[Beatles]] (with footage of the band performing the song), "[[Trampled Under Foot]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]], "[[Starman (song)|Starman]]" by [[David Bowie]], "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (during which the sound of the [[TARDIS]] from ''[[Doctor Who]]'' could be heard), "[[Pretty Vacant]]" by the Sex Pistols (during which dancers on power jumpers wearing large heads with [[Mohawk hairstyle]]s performed a [[Pogo (dance)|pogo]] dance, and the lyrics to the song were spelled out in LED lights around the stadium), "[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]" by [[New Order (band)|New Order]], "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]" by [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] (during which Frankie, asked by June for his name, replied by revealing one of the band's "Frankie say..."

A sequence from the film ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' was projected behind them; when they kissed, a montage of memorable kisses from film, TV and real life was shown (including one of the first interracial kisses on British television in ''[[Emergency Ward 10]]'' and the first lesbian kiss from ''[[Brookside]]'', which in some countries, including Saudi Arabia, then became the first lesbian kiss ever shown on [[Watershed (television)|pre-watershed]] television),<ref name="xan"/> while "[[Song 2]]" by [[Blur (band)|Blur]] was played. A live performance of "[[Bonkers (song)|Bonkers]]" by [[Dizzee Rascal]] followed, along with a further sequence in which all the cast (and ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' dancing duo [[Signature (dance group)|Signature]]) attend a party at June's house whilst [[Amy Winehouse]]'s "[[Valerie (The Zutons song)|Valerie]]", [[Muse (band)|Muse]]'s "[[Uprising (song)|Uprising]]", and [[Tinie Tempah]]'s "[[Pass Out (song)|Pass Out]]" played.<ref name="dizzee"/>

[[File:2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations, Team GB.jpg|thumb|[[Team GB]] enters the [[2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations]] last]]

The Parade of Nations of athletes (drawn from the 10,490 competing) and officials from 204 nations (and also the "[[Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Independent Olympic Athletes]]") was led, according to custom, by the [[Greece|Greek]] team, followed by other competing countries in [[alphabetical order]], and finally the host nation [[Team GB|Great Britain]].  Each of the 205 teams entered the stadium led by their flagbearer, accompanied by a child volunteer carrying a copper petal (later revealed to be part of the [[2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron|cauldron]]) and a young woman carrying a sign with the country's name in English (and wearing a dress made from fabric printed with photos of people who had applied to be Olympic volunteers).<ref name=MedGuide33>{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/mm/Document/Documents/Publications/01/30/43/40/OPENINGCEREMONYGUIDE_English.pdf|title=London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony Media Guide|date=27 July 2012|access-date=1 August 2012|page=33}}</ref>

The parade was accompanied by mainly British dance tracks and popular songs, including "[[Galvanize (song)|Galvanize]]" by [[Chemical Brothers]], "[[West End Girls]]" by [[Pet Shop Boys]], "[[Rolling in the Deep]]" by [[Adele]], "[[Stayin' Alive]]" by the [[Bee Gees]] and both "[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]" and "[[Beautiful Day]]" by Irish band [[U2]], with [[Team GB|Great Britain]] entering to [[David Bowie]]'s song "[["Heroes" (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]".<ref name="koreen"/> Welsh [[drum and bass]] DJ [[High Contrast]] mixed and sequenced the music for the athletes' parade.<ref name=QAug2012/>

Music with a fast rhythm of 120 [[tempo|bpm]]<ref name=QNov2012/> was used in an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was reinforced by the drummers in the stadium; nevertheless the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide. Once all of the athletes were inside the stadium, seven billion [[Confetti|small pieces of paper]] were dropped from a [[Westland Helicopters|Westland helicopter]], each piece representing one person on Earth. Each nation's [[flag]] was planted on the Glastonbury Tor.

Once the athletes had gathered in the centre of the stadium, the [[Arctic Monkeys]] performed "[[I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor]]" and [[The Beatles]]' "[[Come Together]]", the latter whilst 75 cyclists circled the stadium with wings lit by [[LED]]s representing [[Peace symbol#The dove and olive branch|Doves of Peace]]. Doves were traditionally released at Olympic opening ceremonies, although real birds have not been used since 1992.  A single dove cyclist, his beak painted yellow in honour of [[Bradley Wiggins]], appeared to fly out of the stadium.

===Let the Games Begin <small>(00:07–00:24)</small>===

[[File:Muhammed Ali receives the Olympic Flag at the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.JPG|thumb|left|[[Muhammad Ali]] receives the Olympic Flag]]The formal part of the ceremony was introduced by [[Sebastian Coe, Baron Coe|Sebastian Coe]], speaking from the Tor and surrounded by flags of the participating nations.  He welcomed the watching world to [[London]]. He expressed pride in being [[British people|British]] and part of the Olympic movement, and said that the Olympics "brings together the people of the world...to celebrate what is best about mankind".<ref name="xan"/> He continued to speak of the "truth and drama" of sport, and then thanked Britain for "making all this possible". Rogge responded by thanking London, stating that it was the third time that London had held the Games, following [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], held at short notice when [[Rome]] was unable to do so (after a volcanic eruption), and [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] three years after the end of [[World War II]]. Rogge thanked the thousands of volunteers, to huge cheers. He announced that for the first time in Olympic history, every team had female participants. Rogge acknowledged the important role the UK had played as "the birthplace of modern sport", codifying its "fair play" ethos and building sport into the school curriculum.  He appealed to athletes to play fairly and be drug-free, according to the values of [[Pierre de Coubertin|Baron de Courbertin]], reminding them that they were role models who would "inspire a generation". After expressing these sentiments again briefly in French, he invited the Queen to open the Games.<ref name="xan"/>

The Queen declared the competition officially open, immediately followed by a [[trumpet]] fanfare based on a theme from ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' by [[Mike Oldfield]] and then a [[fireworks]] display.<ref name="xan"/> The 2012 ceremony was the second time the Queen had opened an Olympic Games, the first being the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]] in her capacity as [[Queen of Canada]]. It was also the first time any individual had opened a Summer Olympics twice (two more Olympiads had been opened on her behalf, with a further two Winter Games opened on her behalf).

The [[Olympic Flag]] was carried by eight people chosen from around the world to embody the Olympic values: [[Ban Ki-moon]] (as UN general secretary), [[Sally Becker]] (for courage), [[Doreen Lawrence]] (chosen for her "tireless thirst for justice"), [[Haile Gebrselassie]] (for his "fight against poverty"), [[Leymah Gbowee]] (as "a great peacemaker"), [[Shami Chakrabarti]] (for "her integrity"), [[Daniel Barenboim]] (for bringing "harmony in place of discord"), and [[Marina Silva]] (as UN Champion of the Earth).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.sports.yahoo.com/photos/olympic-flag-carried-daniel-barenboim-sally-becker-shami-photo-052852459--oly.html |title=The Olympic flag is carried by Daniel Barenboim, Sally Becker, Shami Chakrabati CBE, Leymah Gbowee, Haile Gebrselassie, Doreen Lawrence OBE, Ban Ki-moon and Marina Silva during the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Summer Games at the Olympic Stadium in London, Saturday, July 28, 2012.

This section was named after [[There Is a Light That Never Goes Out|a song]] by [[The Smiths]]. The [[motorboat]] driven by [[David Beckham]] arrived with the [[Olympic Flame]] via the [[Limehouse Cut]] and the [[Lee Navigation]]. [[Steve Redgrave]] lit his torch from that on the boat, and carried it into the stadium through an honour guard of 500 of the construction workers who had built the [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]].

These were favourably reviewed; in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Michael Hann wrote "Underworld ... had a bit of a triumph: the builds and fades they learned in the world of dance music lent the sometimes overwhelming visual spectacle a sense of structure".<ref>{{cite news |title=Olympic opening ceremony: the music, reviewed|first=Michael|last=Hann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/olympic-opening-ceremony-music?intcmp=239 |work=The Guardian |date=27 July 2012 |access-date=29 July 2012}}</ref>

Musical motifs were used to bind the ceremony programme together: for example, the 'whistling' theme first heard during the minute's silence embedded within "And I Will Kiss" returned frequently – behind the fury as the ring was being forged, emerging triumphant as the five rings came together, and again later as the main theme of 'Caliban's Dream' whilst the flame was paraded around the stadium.

Bells were a theme of the opening day of the Olympics, starting at 8:12{{nbsp}}am with artist [[Martin Creed]]'s ''[[All the Bells|Work No. 1197: All the Bells]]'', when bells were rung across the UK including forty strikes of Big Ben.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bells toll across UK as Martin Creed's army of ringers welcome Olympics |first1=Severin| last1=Carrell| first2=Charlotte| last2=Higgins| url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/27/bells-toll-martin-creed-olympics?newsfeed=true|work=The Guardian |date=27 July 2012 |access-date=30 July 2012}}</ref> "The sound of bells is the sound of England", Boyle had told volunteers during rehearsal.<ref name="moonbook">{{cite book|last1 = Moon | first1 = Russell| title = Days of Wonders | publisher = Oak House Partnership | year= 2012 | isbn = 978-095747310-2}}</ref> Much of the music for the ceremony contained 'bell' references, linking to the large bell forged for the ceremony and evoking bells as "the sound of freedom and peace".  Modified sequences based on the traditional British [[Ring of bells|eight-bell peal]] underlaid "And I Will Kiss" and carried through into the "[[Tubular Bells]]"/NHS section, with [[handbells]] and a tolling large bell featured on 'Caliban's Dream' and at key points in the ceremony. A handbell chime also played after the close, as the stadium emptied.

Boyle approached many of the artists personally, to see if they would be interested in performing, and he also flew to [[Barbados]] for an hour-long meeting with [[Mike Oldfield]]. A few turned him down, including [[Elvis Costello]] and [[David Bowie]].<ref name=GDBCotP/> The performing artists were paid a nominal £1 fee to make their contracts legally binding.<ref name=QAug2012/>

The pre-recorded soundtrack ''[[Isles of Wonder: Music for the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games|Isles of Wonder]]'' was released on iTunes at midnight of 28 July 2012, with a two-disc CD set released on 2 August.<ref>{{cite news |title=Isles of Wonder |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Isles-Wonder-Opening-Ceremony-Olympic/dp/B008MIHQQI/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1343554067&sr=1-1 |work=[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] |access-date=29 July 2012}}</ref> Within two days the download album had topped the iTunes album charts in Britain, France, Belgium and Spain, and reached No. 5 in the United States, as well as being No. 5 in the British album charts.<ref name="washingtonpost1"/> Rick Smith's concluding comment in the CD cover notes was: "The isle is full of noises.  The soundtrack writes itself."

==Technical aspects==
The main loading of the stadium started on 10 May and took ten weeks of what was the wettest summer for a hundred years, posing considerable challenges.<ref name=techvid>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0Z8pCTt1hE|title=Backstage at the London 2012 Olympic Ceremonies|work = Lsionline|date=12 September 2012|access-date=15 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19427139|title=Summer 'wettest in 100 years', Met Office figures show|date=30 August 2012|access-date=15 March 2013|page=15|work=BBC News}}</ref> Dismantling the staging took just sixty hours.<ref name=techvid/> The infield staging area was 2.5 metres high, and had to accommodate the elements revealed during the ceremony, such as the chimneys and beam engines from 'Pandemonium', and the [[2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron|cauldron]]. To ensure that it remained secret, the cauldron was code-named 'Betty', and installed and tested at night.<ref name=techvid/>

The stadium was rigged with a one million watt sound system and more than 500 speakers.<ref name=MedGuide15>{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/mm/Document/Documents/Publications/01/30/43/40/OPENINGCEREMONYGUIDE_English.pdf|title=London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony Media Guide|date=27 July 2012|access-date=1 August 2012|page=15}}</ref> Some {{convert|15000|sqm|acre}} of staging and 12,956 props were used,<ref>{{cite web|title=Olympics ceremony: 27m UK viewers watched opening|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19026694|publisher=BBC News|date=28 July 2012|access-date=2 August 2012}}</ref> as well as {{convert|7346|sqm|acre}} of turf including crops.<ref name=MedGuide21>{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/mm/Document/Documents/Publications/01/30/43/40/OPENINGCEREMONYGUIDE_English.pdf|title=London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony Media Guide|date=27 July 2012|access-date=1 August 2012|page=21}}</ref> 70,799<ref name=MedGuide15/> 25 centimetre (10 inch) pixel panels were placed around the stadium, including between every seat.

Technical director Piers Shepperd masterminded the complex change from rural to industrial during 'Pandemonium'.<ref name="DTPand"/> The seven inflatable chimneys were made by Airworks, and varied in height (three were {{convert|22|m|ft|adj=on}}, two were {{convert|23|m|ft|adj=on}} and two were {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} high). They were made of soft fabric, with an outer layer of printed brick pattern.  Each contained four industrial fans at the base to inflate them, and a smoke machine near the top, and were hoisted into the air from the overhead rigs.<ref name=techvid/> Life-size [[beam engine]]s were constructed onstage by teams of stage hands and members of the Volunteer Staging Team.<ref name="DTPand"/> At the climax of 'Pandemonium', in the [[Olympic symbols#Symbol|Olympic ring]] forging scene, amber lights lit in sequence created the illusion of a {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} molten steel river, with pyrotechnic smoke and [[dry ice]] as steam.  The original grass floor surface had been removed to reveal a giant stylised map of London.<ref>{{cite web|last=Papworth |first=Andrew |url=http://www.huntspost.co.uk/news/latest-news/review_of_the_year_2012_july_september_1_1782551 |title=Review of the Year 2012: July-September|work=Hunts Post  |date=4 January 2013 |access-date=7 January 2013}}</ref>

Working alongside the professional crew were over 800 volunteers; some were production arts students from British drama schools. Many had been working on the Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies since early 2012 at the [[Three Mills#Three Mills Studios|Three Mills Studios]] and [[Dagenham]] rehearsal sites, before moving to the Stadium on 16 June. The thousands of cast were cued and co-ordinated by directions received through earphones ('in-ear monitors'), and adjustments were made during the performance: for example during Pandemonium extra volunteers were sent to make sure all the turf was cleared on time.  The earphones also carried a continuous electronic [[Metronome|metronomic]] four-beat to keep everyone walking and moving in time with the music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZlZZf8MKpM |title=Olympic Opening Ceremony Hidden Camera with performers in ear monitor|date=11 December 2012 |access-date=27 July 2013}}</ref>

In July 2013 it was revealed that on the morning of the ceremony, Britain's surveillance headquarters [[GCHQ]] had detected a credible [[cyber attack]] threat that could have killed the lighting system in the stadium.  Counter-measures were taken, and in the afternoon contingency plans were discussed with government ministers at a meeting in the [[Cabinet Office]] briefing room. However, this attack never materialised.<ref>{{cite web|last=Corera |first=Gordon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23195283|title=The 'cyber-attack' threat to London's Olympic ceremony|publisher=BBC News |date=8 July 2013 |access-date=10 July 2013}}</ref>

The BBC released footage of the entire ceremony on 29 October 2012, edited by Danny Boyle and with background extras, filling more than one disc of a five [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray disc]] set, which also contained more than seven hours of sporting highlights as well as the complete closing ceremony.<ref name=BBCDVD/> A 'BBC commentary-free' option for the opening ceremony is available on the DVD, as well as a commentary track by Danny Boyle and [[Frank Cottrell-Boyce]].<ref name=GdnDVD/> In contrast the [[NBC]] DVD only has highlights of the opening ceremony.

In an end of the year review, British magazine ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' said "It could all have been so different. As the London 2012 Summer Olympics approached, the tide of scepticism seemed almost irreversible. There was the heavy-handed sponsorship, the draconian security, the ticketing problems, the ballooning budget, and the lurking fear that the Opening Ceremony might be, in director Danny Boyle's pungent description, 'shite'. It took less than four hours on the night of Friday 27 July to turn the whole country around.  Not only was the ceremony demonstrably ''not'' shite, it was the most surprising, moving, spectacular cultural event this country had ever seen...modern Britain, in all its berserk, multi-faceted glory."<ref name=QNov2012/>

The writer of the ceremony, [[Frank Cottrell-Boyce]], said: "People around us thought it might need defending, so I was told to do press the next morning. I was completely surprised ''[by the positive response]''.  A lot of people were surprised.  But I don't think Danny was surprised.  Danny never blinked. At no point did he show any feeling that it was going to be anything but amazing.  And he was right."<ref name=QNov2012/>

==Legacy==
The ceremony was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new mood in the United Kingdom: it "had barely finished before it had become a byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's ceremony was hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country.<ref name=GDBCotP/> Boyle himself says this was the most important thing he took away from the Olympic experience: "How important it is to believe in something. You might make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe in that, you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you."

Business leaders also took inspiration from the event, admiring its risk-taking<ref>{{cite web |title= What Every CEO Can Learn From The Olympics' Wacky Opening Ceremony  |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1844301/what-every-ceo-can-learn-olympics%E2%80%99-wacky-opening-ceremony |publisher=Fast Company|first=Adam|last=Hanft|date=1 August 2012 |access-date=14 March 2013}}</ref> and creative freedom, as well as the trust placed in and loyalty inspired from the workers and volunteers.<ref>{{cite web |title= Team Danny Boyle: 5 Lessons in Leadership  |url=http://intentionalworkplace.com/2012/08/02/team-danny-boyle-5-lessons-in-leadership/|publisher=The Intentional workplace|first=Louise|last=Altman|date=2 August 2012 |access-date=14 March 2013}}</ref> In February 2013 the BBC's Head of Drama Ben Stephenson told an audience of writers, commissioners and producers that he "wanted them to seek inspiration from the opening ceremony of the London Olympics" which, he said, "had scale and brilliance and, above all, had succeeded not in spite of its Britishness but because of its Britishness, delighting viewers here and around the world by rooting itself in the authentic stories and spirit of these islands."<ref name=GDBCotP/> [[Steve Coogan]] told [[Frank Cottrell-Boyce]] that he felt it was "like the emperor's new clothes in reverse ... it made irony and postmodernism feel tired and past its sell-by date", and [[Russell T Davies]] told Boyce: "It changed my idea of the possible."<ref>{{cite web |title= We created the hope of a better Britain.

Reviewing the [[2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony]] at [[Sochi]], Russia, Owen Gibson of ''The Guardian'' observed that with his 'complex, intimate snapshot of "who we were, who we are and who we wish to be"', Boyle “rewrote the rule book for opening ceremonies”.<ref>{{cite web |title= Sochi 2014 opening ceremony: Ernst delivers disco-led paean to the past  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/07/sochi-2014-opening-ceremony-ernst-disco-paean-to-past|work=The Guardian|first=Owen|last=Gibson|date=7 February 2014 |access-date= 8 February 2014}}</ref>
