'''The Barack Obama Foundation''' is a [[Chicago]]-based [[nonprofit organization]] founded in 2014. It oversees the creation of the [[Barack Obama Presidential Center]], runs the My Brother's Keeper Alliance, a program [[Barack Obama]] began while he was [[President of the United States|President]], and operates a scholarship program through the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Harris School of Public Policy]].

==History==
The Foundation held its inaugural summit on October 31, 2017, in [[Chicago]]. According to [[Barack Obama]], he intends for his foundation to be central to many of his post-presidential activities, which he sees as having the potential to be more consequential than his time in the [[White House]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/31/barack-obama-foundation-summit-244393?lo=ap_c1|title=Obama, opening his foundation's first summit, calls for fixing civic culture|publisher=Politico|date=October 31, 2017}}</ref> On September 25, 2018, an [[IRS]] report revealed that the Foundation no longer identified any possible mega-donors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/9/25/18413578/fundraising-bonanza-fuels-obama-foundation-top-staffer-earns-whopping-862k|title=Fundraising bonanza fuels Obama Foundation, top staffer earns whopping $862K|first=Lynn|last=Sweet|date=September 25, 2018|website=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> In 2018, contributions and in-kind gifts totaled $164.8 million, according to its filed annual report in June 2019— a drop of $67.8 million from the record $232.6 million in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2019/6/28/19154213/barack-obama-foundation-fundraising-down-2018-higher-pay-top-staffers|title=Obama Foundation fundraising down in 2018, pay for top staffers went up|first=Lynn|last=Sweet|date=June 28, 2019|website=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/obama-center/ct-obama-presidential-center-donations-chicago-foundation-20190628-hb7767q47nal5i5ytivbnsmmwm-story.html|title=Obama Foundation raised $165M last year toward Chicago presidential center, a drop from kickoff year|first=Lolly|last=Bowean|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref> The President of the Obama Foundation is [[Wally Adeyemo|Adewale Adeyemo]], a [[Nigerians|Nigerian]] [[Economist]] and former Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economic Affairs.<ref>https://nairametrics.com/2019/08/07/adewale-adeyemo-appointed-president-of-obama-foundation/ Nairametrics.com</ref>

==My Brother's Keeper Alliance==
The My Brother's Keeper Alliance (MBK Alliance) is a program inspired by President Obama's [[My Brother's Keeper Challenge]] that he started through the [[White House]] in 2014.
