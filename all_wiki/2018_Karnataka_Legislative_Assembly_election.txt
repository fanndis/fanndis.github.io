He added that 550 Sector teams, each headed by a sector magistrate, a police officer (not below the rank of an [[Assistant sub-inspector of police|Assistant sub-inspector]]) and a videographer, were formed, one for every 15 of the 8,274 polling stations in the said region.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vulnerability mapping exercise to ensure free and fair polls|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/vulnerability-mapping-exercise-to-ensure-free-and-fair-polls/article23295477.ece|accessdate=27 March 2018|work=The Hindu|date=19 March 2018}}</ref>

=== Controversies ===

==== Leaked election dates ====
The Election Commission of India ran into a major embarrassment on 27 March 2018, when BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya and the Karnataka Congress' social media in-charge, Srivasta, tweeted the dates before they were officially released.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/india/not-just-bjp-this-congress-man-too-tweeted-about-karnataka-assembly-election-dates-2094064.html|title=Not just BJP, this Congress man too tweeted about Karnataka Assembly election dates|date=27 March 2018|work=Zee News|access-date=14 April 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/latest/873464/ec-promises-action-after-bjps-amit-malviya-tweets-karnataka-poll-dates-before-they-were-announced|title=BJP’s Amit Malviya writes to EC, defends tweeting Karnataka poll dates before their announcement|last=Staff|first=Scroll|work=Scroll.in|access-date=14 April 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> However, both of them got the counting day incorrect in their tweets. Both the tweets were deleted after an outrage on Twitter. Malviya later claimed that he got the information from [[Times Now]], a 24-hour English news channel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/mar/27/picked-karnataka-poll-date-from-times-now-tv-bjps-it-cell-head-amit-malviya-tells-ec-1793283.html|title=Picked Karnataka poll date from Times Now TV: BJP's IT cell head Amit Malviya tells EC|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref> The news was reportedly also shown by a local Kannada news channel. Later it was revealed that even [[Times Now]] got the counting day incorrectly as 18 May 2018, instead of 15 May 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.altnews.in/times-now-kannada-news-channels-air-karnataka-poll-dates-before-ec-announcement/|title=Times Now, Kannada news channels air Karnataka poll dates before EC announcement – Alt News|date=27 March 2018|work=Alt News|access-date=14 April 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

[[Om Prakash Rawat]], the [[Chief Election Commissioner of India]], formed a committee to investigate into the alleged leak.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-sets-up-panel-to-probe-leak-of-karnataka-poll-date/story-hNOCsZBpWfpOySDvDvnY9M.html|title=Election Commission sets up panel to probe leak of Karnataka poll date|date=27 March 2018|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=14 April 2018|language=en}}</ref> The terms of reference of the formed committee included probing certain media outlets and Congress' social media head Srivasta, but not BJP's Amit Malviya.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/elections/karnataka-assembly-elections-2018-ec-probe-panel-excludes-amit-malviyas-name-to-question-congress-worker-tv-channel-5114513/|title=Karnataka poll date leak: EC probe panel to probe media, not Amit Malviya|date=29 March 2018|work=The Indian Express|access-date=14 April 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> This prompted allegations of the Election Commission of India being biased for the BJP by the Congress.

On 14 April 2018, the committee said that the media reports were mere speculation and not a leak.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/karnataka-news/karnataka-poll-date-was-speculation-not-leak-election-commission-committee-1837448|title=Karnataka Poll Date Was Speculation, Not Leak: Election Commission Committee|work=NDTV.com|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref>

==== Voter ID fraud case ====
On 11 May 2018, Congress MLA [[Munirathna]] and 13 others were booked in an alleged fake voter ID scam. On 8 May 2018, almost 10,000 voter ID cards, along with several laptops, were found in a flat in [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]] owned by former BJP leader Manjula Nanjamari.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/elections/karnataka-2018/over-9000-voter-id-cards-unearthed/article23817906.ece|title=Karnataka election 2018: Over 9,000 voter ID cards unearthed in Jalahalli|last=Staff Reporter|date=9 May 2018|accessdate=6 June 2018|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/elections/karnataka-assembly-elections-2018-10000-voter-cards-1-house-bjp-congress-trade-blame-5170715/|title=Karnataka Elections 2018: 10,000 voter cards, 1 house; BJP, Congress trade blame|date=10 May 2018|accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref> Apart from the voter IDs and laptops, the Munirathna's pamphlets were also found, which turned the needle of suspicion on Munirathna. After the FIR, Munirathna said  "I’ve distributed 40,000 pamphlets asking for votes for me in my constituency and you will find them in every home in my segment. I’ve been named as accused no. 14 because one such pamphlet was found in the flat that was raided.

The polling in RR Nagar was postponed to 28 May 2018 and the counting of votes was done on 31 May 2018.

==== Kaveri river water scandal ====

The Karnataka Legislative Assembly election sparked criticisms from Tamil Nadu over the Karnataka's government for not addressing the issue on properly and for its delay in setting up a Kaveri Management Board.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-election-insights-the-politics-of-the-cauvery-water-dispute/articleshow/64095746.cms|title=Karnataka election insights: The politics of the Cauvery water dispute|work=The Times of India|access-date=18 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/elections/karnataka-2018/karnataka-elections-2018-key-regional-issues/article23848377.ece|title=Karnataka elections 2018: key regional issues|last=Jacob|first=Litta|date=11 May 2018|work=The Hindu|access-date=18 May 2018|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> The Supreme Court also issued a strict notice to the Karnataka state government for using the Karnataka Legislative state election as an excuse to resolve the Kaveri riverwater crisis with Tamil Nadu cannot be acceptable.

== Election campaign ==
The [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) officially began its election campaign on 2 November 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Poovanna|first1=Sharan|title=Amit Shah launches BJP’s Karnataka election campaign in Bengaluru|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/G0d1T0VdieBms3uYsw4sHK/Amit-Shah-to-launch-BJPs-campaign-at-Nava-Karnataka-Parivar.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Mint|date=3 November 2017}}</ref> The party spent 85 days covering all the assembly constituencies, culminating in Bangalore on 4 February 2018, with Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] addressing it.<ref>{{cite news|title=In Karnataka, PM Modi addresses crowd of 2 lakh, says 'naked dance of mafia' in Sidda regime|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-karnataka-pm-modi-addresses-crowd-of-2-lakh-says-naked-dance-of-mafia-in-sidda-regime/articleshow/62782660.cms|accessdate=6 February 2018|work=The Times of India|date=5 February 2018}}</ref> In early March, the party launched a 14-day Protect Bengaluru March travelling across Bangalore aimed at, according to the party, "reviving" and "rebuilding" the city from Indian National Congress' "criminal neglect".<ref>{{cite news|title=BJP Launches 14-Day 'Protect Bengaluru March'|url=https://www.ndtv.com/karnataka-news/bjp-launches-14-day-protect-bengaluru-march-1818972|accessdate=3 March 2018|agency=Press Trust of India|publisher=ndtv.com|date=2 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303075134/https://www.ndtv.com/karnataka-news/bjp-launches-14-day-protect-bengaluru-march-1818972|archivedate=3 March 2018}}</ref>

In December 2017, the [[Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee]], although not part of the election campaign, undertook a task of setting up booth-level committees at 54,261 locations in the state which will be responsible to disseminate information on various programmes of the ruling Indian National Congress and their implementation. The move was seen as an "extensive outreach programme" preceding the elections.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Poovanna|first1=Sharan|title=How Karnataka Congress is trying to micromanage 2018 assembly elections|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/Kt5Xv0GrnzqdL5rfKEH65H/How-Karnataka-Congress-is-trying-to-micromanage-2018-assembl.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Mint|date=8 December 2017}}</ref>

=== Preferred Chief Ministerings polling ===
Some opinion pollsters asked voters the party leader they would prefer as Chief Minister – [[Siddaramaiah]] (Indian National Congress), [[B. S. Yeddyurappa]] (Bharatiya Janata Party). or [[H. D. Kumaraswamy]] (Janata Dal (Secular)). Lokniti-CSDS conducted surveys between 10 and 15 January interviewing 878 people. While 34 per cent of the sample wanted Siddaramaiah to remain the chief minister for the next term, 19 per cent chose Kumaraswamy and 14 per cent chose Yeddyurappa.<ref>{{cite news|title=Siddaramaiah best CM, Congress ahead of rivals: Karnataka survey|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/260118/siddaramaiah-best-cm-congress-ahead-of-rivals-karnataka-survey.html|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=Deccan Chronicle|date=26 January 2018}}</ref> A poll conducted by CHS in the same month found that Kumaraswamy was the first choice, followed by Yeddyurappa and Siddaramaiah in that order.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congress survey: Not Siddaramaiah, H D Kumaraswamy is CM front-runner!|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/140118/congress-survey-not-siddaramaiah-h-d-kumaraswamy-is-cm-front-runner.html|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=Deccan Chronicle|date=14 January 2018}}</ref> C-Fore's survey of a sample size of 22,357 voters across 154 assembly constituencies between 1 and 25 March showed that Siddaramaiah, with 45 per cent, was the most popular choice for Chief Minister, followed by Yeddyurappa at 26 per cent and Kumaraswamy at 13 per cent, while 16 per cent preferred 'others'.<ref>{{cite news|title=Karnataka Assembly Elections: Congress Will Better its 2013 Tally, Predicts Survey|url=https://www.news18.com/news/politics/karnataka-assembly-elections-congress-will-better-its-2013-tally-predicts-survey-1699977.html|accessdate=27 March 2018|work=[[News18 India]]|publisher=news18.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326110058/https://www.news18.com/news/politics/karnataka-assembly-elections-congress-will-better-its-2013-tally-predicts-survey-1699977.html|archivedate=26 March 2018}}</ref>

== Exit polls ==
The exit polls remained divided, with only one predicting that a party – BJP – would get past the majority mark. Five polls predicted that BJP would have the most seats, while two predicted that the Congress was in a comfortable lead, and one predicted a cliffhanger. Today's Chanakya exit poll, which was released last and took into account voting right until polling closure time, predicted a clear majority for BJP.

== Government formation ==

=== Hung assembly ===
The election led to a hung assembly, with the BJP emerging as the single largest party, with 104 seats and the Congress winning the popular vote.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|date=16 May 2018|title=Who should get first call to form govt in Karnataka?

The Governor then gave a 15-day window for the new government to prove majority in the legislature, which was shunned by the opposition as favoring towards the BJP. The Supreme court then limited the window to 3 days and then Chief minister Yeddyurappa resigned 10 minutes before the trust vote. The INC JD(S) coalition then formed the cabinet with HD Kumarasamy as Chief minister. This coalition government lasted for 14 months before turmoil started again. 16 Legislators from the ruling coalition resigned within a span of 2 days and 2 independent MLAs switched their support to BJP. This shrunk the house majority to 105 and ruling coalition to a 101, and opposition BJP to a 107. After 3 weeks of turmoil, HD Kumarasamy lost the trust vote by 100–107 in the house (held on 23 July 2019) and resigned. Afterwards on 26 July 2019, B.S. Yeddiyurapa took oath as the Chief Minister of Karnataka once again.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caravanmagazine.in/politics/partisan-role-speaker-compromises-democracy|title=How the increasingly partisan role of the speaker compromises democracy|last=Kumar|first=Alok Prasanna|date=1 July 2018|website=[[The Caravan]]|language=en|url-access=subscription|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 December 2019}}</ref>
