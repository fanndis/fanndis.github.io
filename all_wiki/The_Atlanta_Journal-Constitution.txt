'''''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution''''' ('''''AJC''''') is the only major daily newspaper in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area|metropolitan area of Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States. It is the flagship publication of [[Cox Enterprises]]. The ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' is the result of the merger between '''''The Atlanta Journal''''' and '''''The Atlanta Constitution'''''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Atlanta Constitution |url=https://blog.newspapers.com/the-atlanta-constitution/ |website=Fishwrap |access-date=16 June 2018 |date=16 June 2018}}</ref> The two staffs were combined in 1982.  Separate publication of the morning ''Constitution'' and afternoon ''Journal'' ended in 2001 in favor of a single morning paper under the ''Journal-Constitution'' name.<ref name=writenews/>

The ''AJC'' has its headquarters in the Atlanta suburb of [[Dunwoody, Georgia]].<!--Cited below-->  It was formerly co-owned with television flagship [[WSB-TV]] and six radio stations, which are located separately in [[midtown Atlanta]], however, the AJC remained part of Cox Enterprises, while WSB became part of an independent [[Cox Media Group]]. Past issues of the newspaper are archived in the [[United States Library of Congress]].

==''The Atlanta Journal''==
''The Atlanta Journal'' was established in 1883. Founder E.F. Hoge sold the paper to Atlanta lawyer [[M. Hoke Smith|Hoke Smith]] in 1887. After the ''Journal'' supported Presidential candidate [[Grover Cleveland]] in the 1892 election, Smith was named as [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] by the victorious Cleveland. Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist [[Margaret Mitchell]] worked for the ''Journal'' from 1922 to 1926. Important for the development of her 1936 ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]]'' were the series of profiles of prominent Georgia Civil War generals she wrote for ''The Atlanta Journal's'' Sunday magazine, the research for which, scholars believe, led her to her work on the novel. In 1922, the ''Journal'' founded one of the first radio broadcasting stations in the South, [[WSB (AM)|WSB]]. The radio station and the newspaper were sold in 1939 to [[James Middleton Cox]], founder of what would become Cox Enterprises.  The ''Journal'' carried the motto "Covers [[Dixie]] like the Dew".

==''The Atlanta Constitution''==

In 1868, [[Carey Wentworth Styles]], along with his joint venture partners James Anderson and (future Atlanta mayor) [[William Hemphill]] purchased a small newspaper,  the ''Atlanta Daily Opinion'' which they renamed.''The Constitution'', as it was originally known, was first published on June 16, 1868.<ref name="Nixon">{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=19556720&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjM5NzkxNTk5MSwiaWF0IjoxNTU0NjA4NTYyLCJleHAiOjE1NTQ2OTQ5NjJ9.g8sYKoPF93l05M2pRKS_i3DlmYYd_T8ANWxQsr4movU|title=Constitution's Founder Fought for Georgia with Pen and Sword|publisher=The Atlanta Constitution|author=Raymond B. Nixon|date=June 17, 1945|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref>  Its name changed to ''The Atlanta Constitution'' in October 1869.<ref name=chron_amer/> Hemphill became the business manager, a position that he retained until 1901.<ref name="AJC" /> When Styles was unable to liquidate his holdings in an [[Albany, Georgia|Albany]] newspaper, he could not pay for his purchase of the ''Constitution''. He was forced to surrender his interest in the paper to Anderson and Hemphill, who then each owned one half. In 1870 Anderson sold his one half interest in the paper to Col. E. Y. Clarke.<ref name="Reed1889">{{cite book|author=Wallace Putnam Reed|title=History of Atlanta, Georgia: With Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Some of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers|url=https://archive.org/details/historyatlantag00reedgoog|year=1889|publisher=D. Mason & Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyatlantag00reedgoog/page/n493 409]}}</ref> In active competition with other Atlanta newspapers, Hemphill hired special trains (one engine and car) to deliver newspapers to the [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] marketplace.<ref name="Fourth">{{cite book|title=Fourth Estate: A Weekly Newspaper for Publishers, Advertisers, Advertising Agents and Allied Interests|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gThKAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA19-PA16|year=1917|publisher=Fourth Estate Publishing Company|page=16}}</ref> The newspaper became such a force that by 1871 it had overwhelmed the ''[[Daily Intelligencer (Atlanta)|Daily Intelligencer]]'', the only Atlanta paper to survive the [[American Civil War]]. In August 1875 its name changed to ''The Atlanta Daily Constitution'' for two weeks, then to ''The Constitution'' again for about a year.<ref name=chron_amer2/> In 1876 Captain [[Evan Howell]] (a former ''Intelligencer'' city editor) purchased the 50 percent interest in the paper from E.Y. Clarke, and became its editor-in-chief. That same year, [[Joel Chandler Harris]] began writing for the paper. He soon created the character of [[Uncle Remus]], a black storyteller, as a way of recounting stories from African-American culture. The Howell family would eventually own full interest in the paper from 1902 until 1950.

[[File:Articles_by_and_photo_of_Charlotte_Perkins_Gilman_in_1916.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (pictured) wrote these articles about [[feminism]] for the ''Atlanta Constitution,'' published on December 10, 1916.]]
In October 1876 the newspaper was renamed as ''The Daily Constitution'', before settling on the name ''The Atlanta Constitution'' in September 1881.<ref name=chron_amer3/> During the 1880s, editor [[Henry W. Grady]] was a spokesman for the "[[New South]]", encouraging industrial development as well as the founding of Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Evan Howell's family would come to own ''The Atlanta Constitution'' from 1902 to 1950.<ref name="AJC">{{cite web|url=https://www.ajc.com/about/ajc-history/|title=AJC History: The Story of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=2019|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref>

The ''Constitution'' established one of the first radio broadcasting stations, [[WGM (radio station)|WGM]], which began operating on March 17, 1922, two days after the debut of the ''Journal's'' WSB. However, WGM ceased operations after just over a year. Its equipment was donated to what was then known as [[Georgia School of Technology]], which used it to help launch WBBF (later WGST, now [[WGKA (AM)|WGKA]] AM 920) in January 1924.<ref>"Tech Sends First Message To Radio Fans of America" by Parks Rusk, ''Atlanta Constitution'', January 15, 1924, page 1.</ref>

[[File:WCON Atlanta advertisement (1948).jpg|thumb|1948 advertisement for the ''Constitution's'' AM radio station WCON.]]
In late 1947, the ''Constitution'' established radio station WCON (AM 550).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-R4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT9#v=onepage&q&f=false "WCON, 7th Atlanta AM Outlet, To Encourage Local Talent"] ''The Billboard'', October 25, 1947, page 10.</ref> Subsequently, it received approval to begin operating an FM station, WCON-FM 98.5 mHz, and a TV station, WCON-TV, on channel 2.

But the 1950 merger with the ''Journal'' required major adjustments. Contemporary [[Federal Communications Commission]] "duopoly" regulations disallowed owning more than one AM, FM or TV station in a given market, and the ''Atlanta Journal'' already owned WSB AM 750 and WSB-FM 104.5, as well as WSB-TV on channel 8. In order to comply with the duopoly restrictions, WCON and the original WSB-FM were shut down.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting39unse#page/n81/mode/1up "FCC Roundup: Deletions"], ''Broadcasting'', 3 July 1950, page 76.</ref> The WCON-TV construction permit was canceled, and WSB-TV was allowed to move from channel 8 to channel 2.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting38unse_0#page/n147/mode/1up "Atlanta Merger"], ''Broadcasting'', 10 April 1950, p. 50.</ref> In addition, in order to standardize with its sister stations, WCON-FM's call letters were changed to WSB-FM.

[[Ralph McGill]], editor for the ''Constitution'' in the 1940s, was one of the few southern newspaper editors to support the [[American Civil Rights Movement]]. <!-- How? Sympathetic, truthful reporting? --> Other noteworthy editors of ''The Atlanta Constitution'' include [[J. Reginald Murphy]]. "Reg" Murphy gained notoriety after being kidnapped in 1974. <!-- Surely needs more explanation -->Murphy later moved to the West Coast and served as editor of the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''.

[[Celestine Sibley]] was an award-winning reporter, editor, and beloved columnist for the ''Constitution'' from 1941 to 1999, and also wrote 25 fiction and nonfiction books about Southern life.  After her death, the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] named its press gallery in her honor as a mark of affection and respect.

From the 1970s until his death in 1994, [[Lewis Grizzard]] was a popular humor columnist for the ''Constitution''.  He portrayed Southern "[[redneck (stereotype)|redneck]]" culture with a mixture of ridicule and respect.

''The Constitution'' won numerous [[Pulitzer Prize]]s. In 1931 it won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] for exposing corruption at the local level. In 1959, ''The Constitution'' won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing]] for Ralph McGill's editorial "[[s:A Church, A School|A Church, A School...]]" In 1967 it was awarded another [[1967 Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize]] for [[Eugene Patterson]]'s editorials. (Patterson later left his post as editor over a dispute over an op-ed piece.) In 1960, Jack Nelson won the [[1960 Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize]] for local reporting, by exposing abuses at [[Central State Hospital (Milledgeville, Georgia)|Milledgeville State Hospital]] for the mentally ill.

Even after newsrooms were combined in 1982, the papers were published in independent editions. In 1988 the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]] went to the '' Constitution's'' [[Doug Marlette]]. Editorial cartoonist [[Mike Luckovich]] received Pulitzer Prizes in 1995 and 2006. [[Cynthia Tucker]] received a 2007 [[Pulitzer Prize for Commentary]].

==Merger==
Cox Enterprises bought the ''Constitution'' in June 1950, bringing both newspapers under one ownership and combining sales and administrative offices. Separate newsrooms were kept until 1982. Both newspapers continued to be published for another two decades, with much of the same content except for timely editing.  The ''Journal'', an afternoon paper, led the morning ''Constitution'' until the 1970s, when afternoon papers began to fall out of favor with subscribers. In November 2001, the two papers, which were once fierce competitors, merged to produce one daily morning paper, ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution''. The two papers had published a combined edition on weekends and holidays for years previously.

Prior to the merger, both papers planned to start TV stations: [[WSB-TV]] on channel 8 for the ''Journal'', and WCON-TV on channel 2 for the ''Constitution''.  Only WSB got on the air, beginning in 1948 as the first TV station in the [[Deep South]].  It moved from channel 8 to WCON's [[table of allotments|allotment]] on channel 2 in 1951 to avoid TV interference from the nearby channel 9.  ([[WROM-TV]] since moved, leaving [[WGTV (TV)|WGTV]] on 8, after it was also used by WLWA-TV, now [[WXIA-TV]] 11.)  This was also necessary to satisfy [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules preventing the excessive [[concentration of media ownership]], preventing the combined paper from running two stations.{{clarify|date=September 2015}}

In 1989, [[Bill Dedman]] received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting]] for ''The Color of Money'', his exposé on racial discrimination in mortgage lending, or [[redlining]], by Atlanta banks.<ref name=PowerRptg/> The newspapers' editor, [[Bill Kovach]], had resigned in November 1988 after the stories on banks and others had ruffled feathers in Atlanta and among corporate leadership, some of whom complained of a "take-no-prisoners" editorial approach.<ref name="nyt88">{{cite web|title=Atlanta Editor Resigns After Dispute|author=Albert Scardino|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/05/us/atlanta-editor-resigns-after-dispute.html|date=November 5, 1988}}</ref>

In 1993, Mike Toner received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]] for ''When Bugs Fight Back'', his series about organisms and their resistance to [[antibiotics]] and [[pesticides]].

Julia Wallace was named the first female editor of ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' in 2002. She was named Editor of the Year 2004 by ''[[Editor & Publisher]]'' magazine.<ref name=Edandpub/>

[[Mike Luckovich]] won the Pulitzer Prize for [[Editorial cartoon]]ing a second time in 2006. He had first received it in 1995 under ''The Atlanta Constitution'' banner.

==Circulation==
The paper used to cover all 159 [[counties in Georgia]], and the bordering counties of western [[North Carolina]], where many Atlantans vacation or have second homes. In addition it had some circulation in other bordering communities, such as [[Tallahassee, Florida]], where the Sunday ''AJC'' was available. Due to the downturn in the newspaper industry and competing media sources, the ''AJC'' contracted distribution dramatically in the late 2000s to serve only the metro area.<ref name=AtlBusChron/> From Q1 of 2007 to Q1 of 2010, daily circulation plunged over 44%.<ref name=AtlBusChron2/>

==Headquarters==
The ''AJC'' has its headquarters in [[Perimeter Center]], an office district of [[Dunwoody, Georgia|Dunwoody]], Georgia.<ref name="AJCMoving"/> Previously the ''AJC'' headquarters were in [[Downtown Atlanta]] near the [[Five Points (Atlanta)|Five Points]] district.<ref name=formerHQ/> In August 2009, the ''AJC'' occupied less than 30 percent of its downtown building, which had become outdated and costly to maintain. Later that year, the ''AJC'' consolidated its printing operations by transferring the downtown production center to the [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett County]] facility. In 2010 the newspaper relocated its headquarters to leased offices in Dunwoody, a northern suburb of Atlanta.<ref name="AJCMoving"/>  In November 2010, the company donated its former downtown headquarters to the city of Atlanta, which plans to convert the building into a fire and police training academy.<ref name=formerHQ/>

== Parts ==
The ''AJC'' has four major sections daily. On Sundays, it has additional sections. The main section usually consists of Georgia news, national news, international news, and business news. The Metro section includes major headlines from the [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Metro Atlanta area]]. The Metro section usually reports the weather forecast. The Sports section reports sports-related news. Before social media became popular, the Metro and Sports sections contained "The Vent" features, where readers expressed opinions about current events.<ref>Robin M. Kowalski, ''Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors'', 2013, p. 99 1475793545
Quote: "The ''Atlanta Constitution'', for instance, has a column entitled "The Vent" that contains people's complaints."</ref> The Living section contains articles, recipes, reviews, movie times, and puzzles including [[Sudoku]], crossword puzzle, and word scramble; plus a full page of color comics daily. Comics are printed in a separate section in Sunday editions.
