'''Winston Raymond Peters''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|PC}} (born 11 April 1945) is a New Zealand politician serving as Leader of [[New Zealand First]] since its foundation in 1993. Peters served as [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand]] from 1996 to 1998 and 2017 to 2020, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 2005 to 2008 and 2017 to 2020, and [[Treasurer of New Zealand]] from 1996 to 1998. He was a [[Member of Parliament (New Zealand)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) from 1979 to 1981, 1984 to 2008 and 2011 to 2020.<ref name="Cooke"/><ref>{{Citation |first1=Tim |last1=Bale |first2=Magnus |last2=Blomgren |title=Close but no cigar?: Newly governing and nearly governing parties in Sweden and New Zealand |work=New Parties in Government |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |isbn=9780415404990 |page=94}}</ref>

Peters was born in the [[Northland Region|Northland]] city of [[Whangārei]]. He is of mixed parentage, his father being [[Māori people|Māori]] and his mother being of Scottish descent. Widely known simply as "Winston",<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vowles|first1=Jack|last2=Coffé|first2=Hilde|last3=Curtin|first3=Jennifer|title=A Bark But No Bite: Inequality and the 2014 New Zealand General Election|date=2012|publisher=ANU Press, The Australian National University|location=Canberra|page=167}}</ref> Peters has had a long and turbulent political career since first entering Parliament following the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] win of the [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978 general election]]. Throughout his career, he has called for more focused and restrictive immigration policies.<ref>{{cite web|last1=NZ First|title=New Zealand First immigration policy|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/immigration/news/article.cfm?c_id=231&objectid=10127845|website=The New Zealand Herald|publisher=NZME Publishing|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=27 May 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Mackenziee|first1=Dene|title=Immigration policy 'just facing reality'|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/election-2017/immigration-policy-just-facing-reality|website=Otago Daily Times|publisher=Allied Press Limited|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=7 September 2017}}</ref> He has advocated benefits for senior citizens, criticised the media and "elitism",<ref name="Rydgren"/> and has favoured socially conservative policies.

Peters first served in the [[Ministers of the New Zealand Government|Cabinet]] as [[Minister for Māori Development|Minister of Māori Affairs]] when [[Jim Bolger]] led the National Party to [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|victory]] in 1990. He was dismissed from this post in 1991 after criticising his own Government's economic, fiscal and foreign ownership policies. He resigned from the National Party to form the populist party New Zealand First in 1993. As leader of New Zealand First, he held the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] after the 1996 election and formed a coalition with the National Party, securing the positions of Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer—the latter position created for Peters. However, the coalition dissolved in 1998 following the replacement of Bolger by [[Jenny Shipley]] as Prime Minister. In 1999, New Zealand First returned to [[Loyal opposition|opposition]] before entering government with [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]], in which Peters served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2005 to 2008.

In the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]], after a funding scandal involving Peters and his party, New Zealand First failed to reach the 5% [[Mixed member proportional representation#Procedures#Threshold|threshold]]. As a result, neither Peters nor New Zealand First were returned to Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2008/partystatus.html|title=Official Count Results – Overall Status}}</ref> However, in the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]] New Zealand First experienced a resurgence in support, winning 6.8% of the party vote to secure eight seats in Parliament.<ref name="The return of Peters">{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/The-return-of-Peters/tabid/419/articleID/234326/Default.aspx| archive-url= https://archive.today/20130628180105/http://www.3news.co.nz/The-return-of-Peters/tabid/419/articleID/234326/Default.aspx| url-status= dead| archive-date= 28 June 2013| work= 3 News NZ| title= The return of Peters| date= 27 November 2013}}</ref> In the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014 general election]], NZ First gained 11 seats and finished with 8.66%.<ref name="2014 election results">{{cite web|title=New Zealand 2014 General Election Official Results|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/new-zealand-2014-general-election-official-results|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|New Zealand Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref> In the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 election]], Peters lost his electorate seat of Northland but NZ First won 9 seats overall, with 7.2% of the party vote.<ref name="2017 election results">{{cite web|title=2017 General Election – Official Results|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/|publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref> Following the election, NZ First again held the balance of power and formed a [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|coalition government]] with the Labour Party.

==Early life and education==
Peters' birth certificate records his birth in [[Whangarei]] and his registration as Wynston Raymond Peters.<ref name="Cooke"/> His father is of [[Māori people|Māori]] descent and his mother has Scottish ancestry. His [[iwi]] affiliation is [[Ngāti Wai]] and his [[clan]] is [[Clan MacInnes|MacInnes]]. Two of his brothers, [[Ian Peters|Ian]] and [[Jim Peters (politician)|Jim]], have also served as [[Members of Parliament|MPs]], and another brother, Ron, has also stood as a New Zealand First candidate.{{sfn|Hames|1995|p= 4-5}}{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p= 9-10, 13–14}} According to the journalist [[Ian Wishart (journalist)|Ian Wishart]], Peters had little exposure to the [[Māori language]] and culture during his childhood years due to vigorous assimilation policies that encouraged integration into [[Pākehā]] (New Zealand European) society.{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p= 12}}{{qn|date=November 2018}}

He grew up on a farm in [[Whananaki]],<ref>{{cite news |last1= Manhire |first1= Toby |title= Here comes the maternity-cover PM. But which Winston Peters will we get? |url= https://thespinoff.co.nz/partner/barkers-1972/04-06-2018/here-comes-the-maternity-cover-pm-but-which-winston-peters-will-we-get/ |accessdate= 6 August 2018 |date= 4 June 2018}}</ref> and after attending [[Whangarei Boys' High School]] and [[Dargaville High School]], Peters studied at the [[Auckland College of Education|Auckland Teachers' Training College]]. In 1966 he taught at Te Atatū Intermediate School in [[Auckland]]{{sfn|Hames|1995|p=6}} but the next year went to Australia where he became a blast-furnace worker with [[BHP]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and later a tunneler in the [[Snowy Mountains]].{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p= 14}}

In 1970 Peters returned to New Zealand and studied history, politics and law at the [[University of Auckland]]. During his university years, Peters joined the [[New Zealand Young Nationals]], the youth wing of the center-right [[New Zealand National Party]], and became acquainted with [[Bruce Cliffe]] and [[Paul East]], who later served as Cabinet ministers in the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|Fourth National Government]]. Like his brothers Ron, Wayne, and Allan, Peters played rugby. He was a member of the University Rugby Club in Auckland and captain of the Auckland Māori Rugby team. In 1973, Peters graduated with a BA and [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]]. He married his partner Louise, and later worked as a lawyer at [[Russell McVeagh]] between 1974 and 1978.{{sfn|Hames|1995|p=6-7}}{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p= 14-15}}

Peters entered national politics in [[1975 New Zealand general election|1975 general election]], standing unsuccessfully for the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] in the electorate seat of [[Northern Maori]]; he gained 1,873 votes, and became the first National candidate in a Māori seat for some{{quantify|date= October 2018}} years who did not lose his [[deposit (politics)|deposit]].{{sfn|Hames|1995|p= 7}} This followed a successful campaign by Peters and other members of his [[Ngātiwai|Ngati Wai]] iwi to retain their tribal land in the face of the [[Third Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour government]]'s plan to establish coastal-land reserves for the public. As a result, the government of the day took virtually no ancestral land in the Whangarei coastal areas, and the initiative helped inspire the [[Māori protest movement#1975 Land March|1975 Land March]] led by [[Whina Cooper]].{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p= 18-24}}{{qn|date=July 2020}}

Peters first became a member of parliament following the [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978 general election]], but only after winning in the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] an electoral petition which overturned the election-night result for the seat of {{NZ electorate link| Hunua}} (an electorate in the southern [[Auckland]] city area) against [[Malcolm Douglas (politician)|Malcolm Douglas]], the brother of [[Roger Douglas]]. Peters took his seat – six months after polling day – on 24 May 1979.<ref>{{cite web |last1= Henderson |first1= Calum |title= Chartlander: The dynamite singles chart the day Winston Peters first entered parliament |url= https://thespinoff.co.nz/music/21-09-2017/chartlander-the-dynamite-singles-chart-the-day-winston-peters-first-entered-parliament/ |website= The Spinoff |accessdate= 13 November 2017 |date= 21 September 2017}}</ref> He lost this seat in [[1981 New Zealand general election|1981]], but in [[1984 New Zealand general election|1984]] he successfully stood in the electorate of [[Tauranga (New Zealand electorate)|Tauranga]].{{sfn|Hames|1995|p= 8-16, 28–32}}{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p= 25-29}}<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Candidate-profile-Winston-Peters/tabid/419/articleID/229249/Default.aspx | title= Candidate profile: Winston Peters | publisher=[[3 News]] ([[MediaWorks New Zealand]]) | date= 13 October 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140228134525/http://www.3news.co.nz/Candidate-profile-Winston-Peters/tabid/419/articleID/229249/Default.aspx | archivedate= 28 February 2014 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

On 16 December 1986 Peters exposed the [[Māori loan affair]] in Parliament; this involved the-then [[Te Puni Kōkiri|Māori Affairs Department]] attempting to raise money illegally through a NZ$600&nbsp;million loan-package offered by the Hawaiian businessman Michael Gisondi and the West German businessman Max Raepple.{{sfn|Hames|1995|p= 46-54}}{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p=62-71}} Peters became the National Party's spokesperson on Māori Affairs, Consumer Affairs, and Transport. In 1987 [[Jim Bolger]] elevated him to National's Opposition [[frontbencher|front bench]] as spokesperson for Māori Affairs, Employment, and Race Relations. After National won the [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990 election]], Peters became [[Minister of Māori Affairs]] in the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|fourth National government]], led by Jim Bolger.{{sfn|Hames|1995 |p= 54-108}}{{sfn|Wishart|2014 |p= 72, 115–116}}

[[File:Bolger, 1992.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Peters became an outspoken critic of his party leader, [[Jim Bolger]] (''pictured in 1992'').]]
As Minister of Māori Affairs, Peters co-authored the ''Ka Awatea'' report in 1992 which advocated merging the Ministry of Māori Affairs and the Iwi Transition Agency into the present [[Te Puni Kōkiri]] (Ministry for Māori Development).<ref name="NZ Initiative book">

Peters disagreed with the National Party [[leadership]] on a number of matters and frequently spoke out against his party regarding them. This made him relatively popular with the public. However, his party colleagues distrusted him, and his publicity-seeking behaviour made him increasingly disliked within the party. While National may{{original research inline|date=July 2020}} have tolerated differences of opinion from a backbencher, they were far less willing to accept public criticism from a Cabinet minister, which (they determined) was undermining the party. In October 1991 Bolger sacked Peters from Cabinet.{{sfn|Hames|1995 |p= 91-137}}{{sfn|Wishart|2014 |p= 115-137}}

Peters remained as a National [[backbencher]], continuing to criticise the party. In late 1992, when the National Party was considering possible candidates for the elections in the following year, it moved to prevent Peters from seeking renomination (under any banner). In ''[[Peters v Collinge]]'', Peters successfully challenged the party's actions in the High Court, and in early 1993, he chose to resign from the party and from Parliament. This prompted a [[1993 Tauranga by-election|by-election in Tauranga]] some months before the scheduled general election. Peters stood in Tauranga as an independent and won easily.{{sfn|Hames|1995 |p= 138-189}}{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p= 138-148}}

==Fourth National Government (1993–1999)==
Shortly before the [[1993 New Zealand general election|1993 election]], Peters established New Zealand First. He retained his Tauranga seat in the election. Another New Zealand First candidate, [[Tau Henare]], unseated the Labour incumbent in Northern Maori, helping to convince people that New Zealand First was not simply Peters' personal vehicle. Peters started the [[Winebox Inquiry]] in 1994; which concerned companies using the [[Cook Islands]] as a [[tax haven]].{{sfn|Hames|1995|p=192-204, 209–221}}{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p=148-164, 170–182, 208–231}}

[[File:Winston Peters in Auckland, election time. Mid-1990s. (5477916699).jpg|thumb|left|Peters on the campaign trail in Auckland, {{circa|1993}}]]
During the [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|1992 and 1993 electoral reform referendums]], Peters advocated the adoption of the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) electoral system.<ref>{{cite episode |title=21 Years of MMP |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh8TIYX_oAo|series=[[Q+A]]|publisher=[[TVNZ]]|date=1 October 2017}}</ref> In the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 general election]], the MMP system delivered a large increase in representation for New Zealand First. Instead of the 2 seats in the previous parliament, the party won 17 seats and swept all of the [[Māori electorates]].<ref>{{cite web|title=General Elections 1996–2005|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/events/past-events/general-elections-1996-2005|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref> More importantly, it held the balance of power in Parliament. Neither National nor [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] had enough support to govern alone. Neither party could form a majority without the backing of New Zealand First, meaning Peters could effectively choose the next prime minister.{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p=260-261}}

It was widely expected that he would throw his support to Labour and make Labour leader [[Helen Clark]] New Zealand's first female prime minister. Peters had bitterly criticised his former National colleagues, and appeared to promise that he would not even consider a coalition with Bolger. However, after over a month of negotiations with both parties, Peters decided to enter into a coalition with National.{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p=260-275}} [[Michael Laws]], then New Zealand First's campaign manager, later claimed that Peters had already decided to enter into an agreement with National and used his negotiations with Labour simply to win more concessions from Bolger.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sachdeva |first1=Sam |title=Reading the tea leaves from 1996 |url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2017/07/29/40392/reading-the-tea-leaves-from-1996 |accessdate=10 May 2020 |work=[[Newsroom (website)|Newsroom]] |date=30 July 2017 |language=en-AU}}</ref>

Whatever the case, Peters exacted a high price for allowing Bolger to stay on as Prime Minister. Peters became Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer (senior to the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]]), the latter post created especially for him. Initially, there were concerns about whether Peters would be able to work with Bolger, the National prime minister who had previously sacked him from Cabinet, but the two did not seem to have any major difficulties.{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p=276-281}}

[[File:Jenny Shipley.jpg|thumb|upright|Peters had a strained relationship with Prime Minister [[Jenny Shipley]] (''pictured''), who sacked him from Cabinet.]]
Later, however, tensions began to develop between Peters and the National Party, which only worsened after [[Jenny Shipley]] staged a party room coup and became prime minister. After a dispute over the privatisation of [[Wellington International Airport]], Peters was sacked from Cabinet again on 14 August 1998. He immediately broke off the coalition and led New Zealand First back into opposition.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.localfutures.ac.nz/pdf/Decision_History_Case_Study.pdf |title=Selling the Family Silver: The Sale of Wellington Airport – A Case Study in Local Government Decision-Making |last=Laking |first=Rob |page=28 |year=2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014013015/http://www.localfutures.ac.nz/pdf/Decision%20History%20Case%20Study.pdf |archive-date=14 October 2008}}</ref>{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p=282-292}} However, several MPs, including deputy leader Henare, opted to stay in government and leave New Zealand First.

==Fifth Labour Government (1999–2008)==
New Zealand First was severely mauled in the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]], which saw Labour oust National from power. The party suffered for the rash of party-switching. Additionally, there was a wide perception that Peters had led voters to believe a vote for New Zealand First would get rid of National, only to turn around and go into coalition ''with'' National.  New Zealand First collapsed to 4.3% of the vote. Under New Zealand's MMP rules, a party that falls below the 5% threshold can still qualify for MMP by winning one electorate seat. However, Peters just barely held onto Tauranga, defeating a National challenger by 63 votes. As a result, New Zealand First remained in parliament but was reduced to five seats. Still in opposition (to the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]]), Peters continued to promote his traditional policies, but also became more noticeably concerned about immigration policies.{{sfn|Wishart|2014|p=301-310}}

In the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 election]], Peters performed well once again, campaigning on three main issues: [[opposition to immigration|reducing immigration]], increasing punishments for crime, and ending the "grievance industry" around [[Treaty of Waitangi]] settlements.<ref name="Cooke"/> This message regained much support for both Peters and his party, especially from among the elderly who had in the past backed Winston Peters, and New Zealand First won 10% of the vote and 13 seats. Peters seemed to hope that Labour would choose to ally with New Zealand First to stay in power. However, Clark explicitly rejected this possibility, instead relying on support from elsewhere.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Young |first1=Audrey |last2=Mold |first2=Francesca |title=Clark rules out 'offensive' NZ First |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=2147182 |accessdate=21 July 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=23 July 2002 |language=en-NZ}}</ref>

In a speech at Orewa in 2005, he criticised immigration from Asian countries as "imported criminal activity" and warned that New Zealanders were "being colonised without having any say in the numbers of people coming in and where they are from." He also accused the Labour Party of having an "ethnic engineering and re-population policy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0505/S00702.htm |title=Securing Our Borders and Protecting Our Identity |author=Winston Peters |date=27 May 2005}}</ref> In July 2005, Peters said New Zealand should err on the side of caution in admitting immigrants until they "affirm their commitment to our values and standards".<ref>{{cite news |author=New Zealand First |title=The End of Tolerance |url=https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0507/S00649.htm |accessdate=10 May 2020 |work=[[Scoop.co.nz]] |date=28 July 2005}}</ref>

===2005 election===

As the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 general election]] approached, Peters did not indicate a preference for coalition with either of the major parties, declaring that he would not seek the "baubles of office".<ref name="Haines">{{cite news |last1=Haines |first1=Leah |title=Election 2011: Winston Peters' dramatic rise from the mire |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10769091 |accessdate=10 May 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=26 November 2011 |language=en-NZ}}</ref> He promised to either give support in confidence and supply to the party with the most seats, or to abstain from no-confidence votes against it, and that he would not deal with any coalition that included the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]].

In the election, some of New Zealand First's traditional support moved to National. Peters himself narrowly lost his longstanding hold on Tauranga to National MP [[Bob Clarkson]], but New Zealand First did well enough to receive seven seats (down from 13 in 2002), allowing Peters to remain in Parliament as a list MP. Soon after the 2005 election Peters launched a legal challenge against Clarkson. The case alleged that Clarkson had spent more than the legal limit allowed for campaign budgets during elections in New Zealand. This legal bid ultimately failed, with a majority of the judges in the case declaring that Clarkson had not overspent.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gulliver |first1=Aimee |title=Bob Clarkson: The man who beat Winston Peters |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/67523999/bob-clarkson-the-man-who-beat-winston-peters |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=27 March 2015 |language=en-NZ}}</ref>

In negotiations with Helen Clark after the election, Peters secured the ministerial portfolios of Foreign Affairs and Racing in the Labour-led government, a move which apparently lay at odds with his earlier promise to refuse the "baubles of office".<ref name="Haines"/> He was a member of the [[Executive Council of New Zealand|Executive Council]], although he was outside cabinet; he was able to criticise the government in areas not related to his portfolios, which experts said was an unprecedented situation.

Allegations concerning Peters' involvement with Simunovich Fisheries and former Member of Parliament [[Ross Meurant]], who was engaged as both adviser to Peters and in undefined business activities with Peter Simunovich (managing director of Simunovich Fisheries), culminated in a Parliamentary Select Committee enquiry into what became known as the 'scampi enquiry'.

===2008 election===
[[File:WinstonPetersEuropa.jpg|thumb|Peters at the Europa Lecture 2008, [[University of Auckland]]]]
Peters tried to regain Tauranga in the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 election]] and lost to National's [[Simon Bridges]] by a margin of 11,742 votes, a much larger loss than in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2008/electorate-51.html |title=Official Count Results—Tauranga |publisher=[[New Zealand Ministry of Justice]] |accessdate=25 November 2008}}</ref> The loss was attributed to fallout from the fundraising scandal that was seen to have damaged Peters' credibility.<ref name="Haines"/>

Despite this, political commentators described the defeat as "the end of the road" for Peters.<ref name="peterslaststand">{{Cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10541899 |title=Winston Peters' last stand is a lost battle |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=9 November 2008 |first1=Jared |last1=Savage |first2=Leah |last2=Haines}}</ref>

==In opposition (2008–2017)==

Harawira had formed an [[Internet Party and Mana Movement|electoral pact]] with the [[Internet Party (New Zealand)|Internet Party]], which was funded by controversial internet entrepreneur [[Kim Dotcom]].

{{see also|2015 Northland by-election}}
In 2015, National MP [[Mike Sabin]] was forced to resign, leaving his seat of [[Northland (New Zealand electorate)|Northland]] open. The seat, located in the [[Far North District]], and its predecessors had been in National hands for decades. However, Peters ran for the seat and won it with a commanding majority—the first time that New Zealand First had won an electorate seat since 2005. With Peters resigning his list seat to take up the Northland seat, this allowed New Zealand First's representation in parliament to increase to 12, with Ria Bond, the next available candidate on New Zealand First's party list filling the vacant list seat.

===2017 election===
During the lead-up to the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], Peters reaffirmed his support for the campaign by families of the victims of the 2010 [[Pike River Mine disaster]] to reenter the mine to recover their loved ones. Peters publicly stated that re-entry to the mine would be non-negotiable in any coalition deal and dismissed claims that it was too dangerous to re-enter the mine.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winston Peters reaffirms his support for Pike families' campaign to re-enter mine|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/winston-peters-reaffirms-his-support-pike-families-campaign-re-enter-mine|accessdate=9 October 2017|publisher=[[1 News]]|date=15 January 2017}}</ref>

On 13 July, Peters traded barbs with [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] MPs [[Barry Coates]] and [[Metiria Turei]].

Peters responded that Coates' comments were the "height of stupidity". He also rejected Turei's claims that New Zealand First was racist and warned that there would be consequences for the Greens in any post-election talks. Green co-leader [[James Shaw (New Zealand politician)|James Shaw]] later clarified that Coates' remarks did not represent Green Party policy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Green MP's comments on NZ First the 'height of stupidity' – Winston Peters|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11889937|accessdate=11 October 2017|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=13 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Jenna|title=Green MP threatens new election if Labour goes with NZ First|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2017/07/green-mp-threatens-new-election-if-labour-goes-with-nz-first.html|accessdate=11 October 2017|publisher=[[Newshub]]|date=13 July 2017}}</ref>

At New Zealand First's convention in South Auckland on 16 July 2017, Peters announced that if elected his party would hold a double referendum on eliminating the [[Māori electorates|Māori seats]] and reducing the number of MPs in Parliament from 120 to 100 in mid-term 2017–2020.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moir|first1=Jo|title=Winston Peters delivers bottom-line binding referendum on abolishing Maori seats|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/94776411/winston-peters-delivers-bottomline-binding-referendum-on-abolishing-maori-seats|accessdate=9 October 2017|publisher=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|date=16 July 2017}}</ref> Peters also outlined his party's policies which included reducing immigration to 10,000 a year and nationalising the country's banks.

Following the 2017 election, Peters entered into coalition–forming talks with senior figures from the National and Labour parties. Neither major party had enough support to govern alone. National Party leader and Prime Minister [[Bill English]] signalled an interest in forming a coalition with NZ First; a potential National–NZ First coalition would have had 65 seats between them, enough to govern without the need for support from other parties. Labour leader [[Jacinda Ardern]] announced that her party was considering a three-way coalition with NZ First and the Greens.

In August 2019, Peters called for a binding referendum on the Government's proposed [[Abortion Legislation Act 2020|Abortion Legislation Bill]], claiming that it had not been part of New Zealand First's coalition agreement with Labour. Peters' remarks surprised both Justice Minister [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] of the Labour Party and NZ First MP and cabinet minister [[Tracey Martin]], who had participated in months of negotiations on the bill. Peters also declared that New Zealand First MPs would not be allowed a conscience vote on the issue and would vote as a caucus to support the bill at first reading.

==Controversies==
=== Party donations ===
Peters attracted media attention in 2008 over controversial payments for legal services and party donations. He had received $100,000 in 2006 to fund legal costs of challenging the election of Bob Clarkson to the Tauranga electorate. The money came from [[Owen Glenn]], a wealthy New Zealand businessman and philanthropist based in Monaco. Under parliamentary rules, any gift to MPs over the value of $500 must be declared. Peters denied knowing about the source of the money but this was not corroborated by his lawyer [[Brian Henry (lawyer)|Brian Henry]] and Glenn contradicted Peters' denial.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10529238 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120911195438/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10529238 |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 September 2012 |title=Peters under fire after Glenn says he asked for donation |last=Oliver |first=Paula |date=27 August 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=27 August 2008}}</ref>

The Vela family, prominent in the racing industry, had donated $150,000 to Peters over a four-year period. The payments were made in sums of $10,000 to remain within rules governing political party funding. ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]'' published details from New Zealand First sources that before the 2005 election $25,000 had been donated to the party from [[Bob Jones (businessman)|Sir Bob Jones]] via the Spencer Trust.

=== Superannuation payments ===

In late August 2017, Peters admitted being overpaid in [[superannuation]] for seven years while living with his longtime partner Jan Trotman.  The overpayment occurred because the relationship status box on his application form was left blank. Peters stated that he and the Ministry agreed that there had been a payment error but said he had paid the money back – amounting to nearly $18,000.  Peters paid interest and penalties on the overpayment.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Murphy |first1=Tim |title=Peters: overpaid and under pressure |url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2017/08/28/44815/peters-overpaid-and-under-pressure |accessdate=22 July 2020 |work=[[Newsroom (website)|Newsroom]] |date=28 August 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200615054806/https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2017/08/28/44815/peters-overpaid-and-under-pressure |archivedate=15 June 2020}}</ref>

The overpayment was subsequently leaked to the media. Peters described it as a private matter and expressed outrage that it had been leaked. In 2019, while serving as Deputy Prime Minister, he took former National ministers [[Paula Bennett]] and [[Anne Tolley]], the Ministry of Social Development, its former chief executive Brendon Boyle, and State Services Commissioner Peter Hughes to court seeking $450,000 from each defendant for breaching his privacy.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cheng |first1=Derek |title=Winston Peters fact-check: $18,000 repayment amount 'demonstrably false' in 2017 |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=12284147 |accessdate=22 July 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=11 November 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113042445/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=12284147 |archivedate=13 November 2019}}</ref>

On 20 April 2020, Justice Geoffrey Venning of the Auckland High Court dismissed Peters' case against Bennett, Tolley, the Ministry of Social Development, Boyle, and Hughes on the basis that Peters had not been able to establish that they were responsible for the disclosure of the payment irregularity to the media. However, the High Court also ruled that Peters' privacy had been deliberately breached during the lead-up to the 2017 general election in order to publicly embarrass him and cause him harm.<ref>{{cite news |title=Winston Peters superannuation leak privacy court claim fails |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/414684/winston-peters-superannuation-leak-privacy-court-claim-fails |accessdate=22 July 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613154720/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/414684/winston-peters-superannuation-leak-privacy-court-claim-fails |archivedate=13 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Davison |first1=Isaac |title=Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters fails in privacy claim against Paula Bennett, Anne Tolley and others |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12326193 |accessdate=22 July 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=20 April 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200622035014/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12326193 |archivedate=22 June 2020}}</ref>

On 20 July 2020, Winston Peters was ordered by the Auckland High Court Justice Venning to pay a total $320,000 to the defendants Bennett and Tolley, State Services Commissioner Peter Hughes, the Ministry of Social Development and its former chief executive Brendan Boyle.

===Antarctic trip===
On 22 July 2020, Peters attracted media scrutiny for allegedly using his position as Minister of Foreign Affairs to get [[Antarctica New Zealand]] to arrange a taxpayer–funded trip to [[Antarctica]] for two wealthy friends. Peters defended his actions and claimed that he was trying to raise NZ$50 million in private sponsorship to offset some of the costs of the NZ$250 million redevelopment of New Zealand's Antarctic base [[Scott Base]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Malpass |first1=Luke |last2=Manch |first2=Thomas |title=Winston Peters: I was trying to 'shake Antarctica NZ from its torpor' |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/122211917/winston-peters-i-was-trying-to-shake-antarctica-nz-from-its-torpor |accessdate=22 July 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=22 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200722115401/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/122211917/winston-peters-i-was-trying-to-shake-antarctica-nz-from-its-torpor|archive-date=22 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Winston Peters says taxpayer funded Antarctica trip for friends aimed to raise funds for Scott Base |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/winston-peters-says-taxpayer-funded-antarctica-trip-friends-aimed-raise-funds-scott-base |accessdate=22 July 2020 |work=[[1 News]] |date=22 July 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200722115521/https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/winston-peters-says-taxpayer-funded-antarctica-trip-friends-aimed-raise-funds-scott-base |archivedate=22 July 2020}}</ref>
