'''''Teletubbies''''' is a British [[children's television series]] created by [[Anne Wood]] and [[Andrew Davenport]] for [[BBC]]. The programme focuses on four multi-coloured creatures known as "Teletubbies", named after the television screens implanted in their abdomens. Recognised throughout [[popular culture]] for the uniquely shaped antenna protruding from the head of each character, the Teletubbies communicate through gibberish and were designed to bear resemblance to toddlers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bridging real world and toddler fantasy, Teletubbies reaches youngest audience|url=http://current.org/files/archive-site/ch/ch803t.html|accessdate=20 May 2016|work=Current.org|date=16 February 1998|last=Everhart|first=Karen|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817235434/http://current.org/files/archive-site/ch/ch803t.html|archive-date=17 August 2016}}</ref>

The series rapidly became a commercial success in Britain and abroad. It won multiple [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards and was nominated for two [[Daytime Emmy Award|Daytime Emmys]] throughout its run.<ref name="BBC News Entertainment: Tubbies toast another three years">{{cite news|title=Tubbies toast another three years|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/287940.stm|accessdate=3 June 2015|work=BBC News|date=1 March 1999}}</ref><ref name="bafta-2002">{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/childrens/nominations/?year=2002|title=Past Winners and Nominees&nbsp;– Children's&nbsp;– Awards&nbsp;– 2002|publisher=[[BAFTA]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref> A [[Teletubbies say "Eh-oh!"|single based on the show's theme song]] reached number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in December 1997 and remained in the Top 75 for 32 weeks, selling over a million copies.<ref name="Spilsbury2012">{{cite book|author=Richard Spilsbury|title=Simon Cowell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzHagb095xgC&pg=PA16|date=1 July 2012|publisher=Heinemann Library|isbn=978-1-4329-6434-4|pages=16–}}</ref> By October 2000, the franchise generated over £1{{nbsp}}billion ({{US$|{{To USD|1|GBR|year=2011}} billion|long=no}}) in merchandise sales.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Tim |title=Innovating at the Edge |date=2012 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781136395352 |page=203 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ocABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA203}}</ref>

The original series returned to live TV in the US on [[Pluto TV]] on 1 May 2019 but the episodes are shown in the UK format instead of the US which is where the Pluto TV service is based in. The same error occurred with the series' availability on the NOGGIN app since 25 May 2016.

== Plot ==
The programme takes place in a grassy, floral landscape populated by rabbits with bird calls audible in the background. The main shelter of the four Teletubbies is an [[earth house]] known as the "Tubbytronic Superdome" implanted in the ground and accessed through a hole at the top or an especially large semicircular door at the dome's foot. The Teletubbies co-exist with a number of strange contraptions such as the Noo-noo, the group's anthropomorphic blue [[vacuum cleaner]], and the Voice Trumpets. The show's colourful, psychedelic setting was designed specifically to appeal to the attention spans of infants and unlock different sections of the mind while also educating young children of transitions that can be expected in life.

An assortment of rituals are performed throughout the course of every episode, such as the playful interactions between the Teletubbies and the Voice Trumpets, mishaps caused by the Noo-noo, the footage of children displayed on the screens in the Teletubbies' stomachs, and the magical event that occurs once per episode. The event differs each time; it is often caused inexplicably and is frequently strange yet whimsical. Each episode is closed by the Voice Trumpets and the narrator. The disappointed, reluctant, but eventually obedient Teletubbies bid farewell to the viewer as they go back to the Tubbytronic Superdome while the Sun Baby sets.

He is green and named after his antenna, which resembles a [[dipstick]]. Dipsy is the most stubborn of the Teletubbies, and will occasionally refuse to go along with the others' group opinion. His face is notably darker than the rest of the Teletubbies, and the creators have stated that he is [[Black people|black]].<ref name="16things">{{cite news| title=Teletubbies: 16 things you didn't know|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10903566/Teletubbies-16-things-you-didnt-know.html|date=24 December 2014|accessdate=5 April 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]}}</ref>He often wears a large hat with a black and white pattern.
*{{anchor|Laa-Laa}}'''Laa-Laa''' (played by [[Nikky Smedley]] in the original series and by [[Rebecca Hyland]] in the revival series)<ref name="Zap2it Cast" /> is the third Teletubby.

He hardly ever ventures outside the Tubbytronic Superdome, instead remaining indoors and constantly cleaning with his sucker-like nose. He communicates through a series of slurping and sucking noises. He occasionally misbehaves and sucks up anything from tubby toast to blankets, which prompts the Teletubbies to call him "Naughty Noo-noo" and give chase. He was blue in the original series and had orange, pink and yellow stripes in the revival series.
*The '''Voice Trumpets''' (voiced by [[Eric Sykes]], [[Toyah Wilcox]], [[John Simmit]], Gary Stevenson, Alex Hogg, [[Alex Pascall]], [[Tim Whitnall]] and [[Rudolph Walker]] in the original series, [[Sandra Dickinson]], [[Toni Barry]] and [[John Schwab]] used in the US series from PBS, and [[Fearne Cotton]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Antonia Thomas]], [[Teresa Gallagher]], [[David Walliams]] and [[Rochelle Humes]] in the revival series)<ref name="Teletubbies Characters">{{cite web|title=About Teletubbies: The Characters|url=http://us.teletubbies.com/about-teletubbies/}}</ref> are several devices resembling periscopes that rise from the ground and interact with the Teletubbies, often engaging in games with them and serving as supervisors.

She acts as a wake-up call for the Teletubbies.
*Numerous '''rabbits''' are found throughout Teletubbyland, and are depicted by several [[Flemish Giant]] rabbits. The Teletubbies enjoy watching them hop and play. The rabbits are the only type of Earth animal found in the land, and take residence in rabbit holes and bushes.
*The '''Tubby Phone''' (voiced by [[Jane Horrocks]])<ref name="Teletubbies Characters" /> is a character in the revival series. Tubby Phone has the ability to make "Tubby Phone dance" and Teletubbies dance after they pushed the button on the phone. At one point, it has ability to make Tubby photos.

==Production==
The show was created by Anne Wood and Andrew Davenport after the BBC had requested their pitch for a show aimed at preschoolers. Inspired by Davenport's interest in [[astronaut]]s and specifically [[Apollo 11]], the first [[Moon landing]], as well as their concern about "how children were reacting to the increasingly technological environment of the late 1990s", the two put together a pitch which the BBC picked up.<ref name="Howwemade">{{cite web |last1=Tims |first1=Anna |title=How we made: Teletubbies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jun/03/how-we-made-teletubbies |website=Guardian |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref>

Finding a suitable shooting location was a challenge as they wanted to film the production outside but couldn't find a suitable location "with a suitable bowl-like dip". They ended up filming on a farm in [[Wimpstone, Warwickshire]]<ref name="ourwarwickshire-org"/> where they had previously shot ''[[Tots TV]]''.<ref name="Howwemade"/> Due to problems with a previous television show shooting at the location, the shooting was protested by the locals although they calmed down after being assured that "it was a low-key children's programme and no one would be aware of the filming".<ref name="Howwemade"/> After the show took off, though, its popularity caused the land to be flooded by the press. According to Davenport, the press was particularly interested in getting photos of the actors in their Teletubby costumes without their heads on. Eventually the team took measures to secure their privacy including blindfolding visitors coming to the set as well as creating a tent for the actors to change in secret.<ref name="Howwemade"/>

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
[[Common Sense Media]]'s Emily Ashby found that "while the show's examples of cooperative play, wonder, and simple joys are gentle and pleasing, the creatures can still be a little grating to parents watching along."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/teletubbies-2016|title=Teletubbies TV Review – Common Sense Media|work=[[Common Sense Media]]|last=Ashby|first=Emily|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref> Caryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated in her review that the episodes "offer a genuinely appealing combination: cute and slightly surreal."<ref>{{cite news| title=TELEVISION REVIEW; Teletubbies Say Eh-Oh, And Others Say Uh-Oh|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/06/arts/television-review-teletubbies-say-eh-oh-and-others-say-uh-oh.html|date=6 April 1998|accessdate=5 June 2014|last=James|first=Caryn|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Upon the show's release, some critics feared that the characters' use of babbling in place of complete sentences would negatively affect young viewers' ability to communicate. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported in 1997 that many parents objected to its "goo-goo style" and "said the show was a bad influence on their children."<ref>{{cite news|title=TELETUBBIES: Are They Harmless Fun or Bad for Our Children?|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-61096732|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=23 May 1997}} {{subscription required|via=Questia Online Library}}</ref> Marina Krcmar, a professor of communication at the [[Wake Forest University]], told interviewers in 2007 that "toddlers learn more from an adult speaker than they do from a program such as ''Teletubbies''."<ref>{{cite news| title=Teletubbies can't beat people in teaching first words|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-education-toddlers-teletubbies-idUSL2889488920070701|date=1 July 2007|accessdate=27 May 2016|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> However, Paul McCann of ''[[The Independent]]'' defended this aspect of the show, stating that "''Teletubbies'' upsets those who automatically assume that progressive and creative learning is trendy nonsense. Those who believe that education should be strictly disciplined and functional, even when you're 18 months old. Thankfully ''Teletubbies'' isn't for them. It's for kids."<ref name="Tegna" />

=== Tinky Winky controversy ===
A controversy began in 1999 related to Tinky Winky and his carrying a bag that looks much like a woman's handbag<!--not "purse", which has a different meaning in UK English--> (although he was first "[[outing|outed]]" by the academic and cultural critic [[Andy Medhurst]] in a letter of July 1997 to ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'').<ref>{{cite news| title=The Outing of Tinky Winky|url=http://priceonomics.com/the-outing-of-tinky-winky/|accessdate=27 May 2016|publisher=Priceonomics}}</ref> He aroused the interest of [[Jerry Falwell]] in 1999 when Falwell alleged that the character was a "[[gay]] role model". Falwell issued an attack in his ''[[National Liberty Journal]]'', citing a ''[[Washington Post]]'' "In/Out" column which stated that [[lesbian]] comedian [[Ellen DeGeneres]] was "out" as the chief national gay representative, while trendy Tinky Winky was "in". He warned parents that Tinky Winky could be a covert homosexual symbol, because "he is [[purple]], the [[gay pride]] colour, and his antenna is shaped like a triangle: the [[LGBT symbols|gay pride symbol]]."<ref>{{cite news| title=Falwell Sees Gay in a Teletubby | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/11/us/national-news-briefs-falwell-sees-gay-in-a-teletubby.html|date=11 February 1999|accessdate=6 November 2010}}</ref> The BBC made an official response, explaining that "Tinky Winky is simply a sweet, technological baby with a magic bag."<ref name="Kraidy2007">{{cite book|author=Kraidy|title=Hybridity, OR the Cultural Logic of Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7-c1qL_VMIC&pg=PA106|date=1 September 2007|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-1100-2|pages=106–}}</ref> Ken Viselman of Itsy-Bitsy Entertainment commented, "He's not gay.

In May 2007, [[Children's ombudsman#Poland|Polish Ombudsman for Children]], [[Ewa Sowińska]] revisited the matter, and planned to order an investigation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6698753.stm|title=Poland targets 'gay' Teletubbies|author=Adam Easton|work=BBC News|date=28 May 2007}}</ref> "I noticed that he has a woman's handbag, but I didn't realise he's a boy," Sowińska said in a public statement. She asked her office's [[psychologist]]s to look into the allegations.

=== ''The Lion and the Bear'' controversy ===
In April 1997, the episode titled "See-Saw" (season 1) aired and featured a sketch about a cut-out [[lion]] (voiced by [[Eric Sykes]]) chasing a cut-out [[bear]] (voiced by [[Penelope Keith]]).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0868818/fullcredits</ref> The sketch was criticised for its unsettling cinematography, music, and character design and was deemed inappropriate for children. It was subsequently banned in several countries.<ref>https://www.sickchirpse.com/episode-teletubbies-so-creepy-banned-television/</ref><ref>https://www.joe.ie/movies-tv/watch-episode-tellytubbies-creepy-banned-tv-615007</ref> In 2000, a revised version of the sketch was aired with adjusted editing, sound design, and voice acting to improve the tone;<ref>http://willdoartforfood.com/the-lion-and-bear-a-masterpiece-in-horror-without-even-trying/</ref> both versions have been posted online several times.

=== Cult following ===
Although the programme is aimed at children between the ages of one and four, it had a substantial [[cult following]] with older generations, mainly [[university]] and [[college]] [[student]]s.<ref name="Company2012"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Deconstructing Teletubbies: Differences between UK and US college students' reading of the children's television programme.|last=Gutenko|first=Gregory|publisher = College of Arts & Sciences, University of Missouri-Kansas City|location=Kansas City, Missouri, USA}}</ref><ref name="Brewer2010">{{cite book|author=Susan Brewer|title=Collecting Classic Girls' Toys|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J92wBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA153|date=19 July 2010|publisher=Remember When|isbn=978-1-78337-521-9|pages=153–}}</ref> The mixture of bright colours, unusual designs, repetitive non-verbal dialogue, ritualistic format, and occasional forays into physical comedy appealed to many who perceived the programme as having [[psychedelic experience|psychedelic]] qualities.<ref>{{cite news| title=Uh-Oh!

=== Analysis ===
[[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]] suggests that ''Teletubbies'' constitutes an example of radical [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian fiction]]. In this reading, the Teletubbies are an advanced culture which has eliminated all need to work, worry, or struggle in any way, and regressed into a childlike state. Roberts positions the Teletubbies as the endpoint of the science-fictional idea of paradise based on infantilisation – a more extreme version of the future humans in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' and the [[Eloi]] in [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (who are mentally childlike, but still physically and sexually adult). Following [[Sigmund Freud]]'s insight that adult pleasure must mediate [[Id, ego and super-ego|id and super-ego]] – gratification and anxiety – the only way to attain a completely stress-free life is to surrender the super-ego, including sex. It follows that the broadcasts shown on the Teletubbies' in-set televisions are historical documentaries suggesting infantile existence as the paradigm, with the baby in the sun likely being the society's central machine intelligence. Roberts concludes:

<blockquote>In other words, the toddler-oriented aspect of the show can be read not in clumsily production-intention terms (‘the show is designed to appeal to toddlers’), but as a commentary upon the necessary infantilisation implicit in any utopian fantasy. It poses a question: to achieve a total happiness for all on the planet, once technology has removed the practical barriers, how far along the road towards infantile consciousness will it be necessary to travel? Will we become like the citizens of Huxley’s Brave New World? Or more infantile, like Wells’s Eloi? Or will we go the whole hog, and subsume our angst-ridden adult consciousnesses completely in the bright colours and satisfying repetitions of Teletubbyland? The enduring appeal of the Teletubbies to adults suggests, perhaps, this latter."<ref>{{cite web|title=Time for Teletubbies: Radical Utopian Fiction|url=https://www.gollancz.co.uk/2011/11/time-for-teletubbies-radical-utopian-fiction/|last=Roberts|first=Adam|author-link=Adam Roberts (British writer)|date=22 November 2011|publisher=[[Victor Gollancz Ltd]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117083232/https://www.gollancz.co.uk/2011/11/time-for-teletubbies-radical-utopian-fiction/|archive-date=17 January 2012|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

* In 2012, during both the second and third series of [[TVN (South Korean TV channel)|TVN]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live Korea]]'', the programme was referenced as ''[[Yeouido]] Teletubbies'' (여의도 텔레토비) to portray the [[2012 South Korean presidential election|2012 presidential election campaign]]. This experimental skit caused the popularity of SNL Korea's "Crew", [[Kim Seul-gi]] and [[Kim Min-kyo]], who acted major candidates respectably, to skyrocket.<ref>[http://english.khan.co.kr/khan_art_view.html?code=710100&artid=201211071443357 Laugh and Enjoy a Satire of the Presidential Election, "Yeouido Teletubbies"], Kyunghyang Shinmun, 7 November 2012, Retrieved on 19 January 2013.</ref>
