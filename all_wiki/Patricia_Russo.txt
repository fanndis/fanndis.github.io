''[[Forbes]]'' Magazine rated Russo as 10th on its [[Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|List of the World's 100 Most Powerful Women]] in 2006.<ref name="forbes">[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/11/06women_Patricia-Russo_ZE1Y.html #25 Patricia Russo], from the 2006 ''Forbes'' "List of the 100 Most Powerful Women".</ref>

==Career at Lucent==
Russo joined Lucent's predecessor in 1982.<ref name="light">[http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=10653&print=yes Lucent's Next Leader], a January 2002 article from LightReading.com</ref>  In 1992, she became President of the Business Communications Systems division, moving in 1997 to become the Executive Vice President (VP) of Corporate Operations, and in 1999 to Executive VP and CEO of the Service Provider Networks Group.<ref name="light"/>  She left in August 2000, after a reorganization; however, returned in January 2002 to become the CEO.<ref name="light"/> After "cutting costs and focusing on sales of wireless equipment, Russo was credited with returning Lucent to profitability in 2004, after three years of red ink."<ref name="forbes"/> However, profits that year "came largely through slashes in spending, cuts to retiree benefits, and reductions in research-and-development budgets that spurred protests."<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1013745/Patricia-Russo Patricia Russo]</ref>

On April 2, 2006, it was announced that Russo would assume the CEO role of a new combined company resulting from the merger of the French communications company [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]] and Lucent.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}  This merger became effective on December 1, 2006. When Russo became the CEO of the combined company, [[Serge Tchuruk]], the former CEO of [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], remained as chairman.

The newly combined entity failed to turn a profit, and as a result, the company's management team resorted to rounds of restructuring and layoffs to address what were considered "challenging market conditions".<ref name="The New York Times">[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/10/business/10alcatel.html Alcatel-Lucent Posts Big Loss, Plans Further Job Cuts ]</ref>  The board eventually decided to oust the management team, and on July 29, 2008, Russo, along with Alcatel-Lucent chairman Serge Tchuruk, announced that she would step down by the end of 2008, in a broad-reaching management restructuring.<ref name="BloombergBusinessweek">[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-07-29/ceo-and-chairman-out-at-alcatel-lucentbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice CEO and Chairman Out at Alcatel-Lucent ]</ref>  Significant changes in the composition of the company's board were also announced. Alcatel-Lucent shares had lost more than 60% of their value since the merger.<ref name="BloombergBusinessweek"/>
 
In the statement released by Alcatel-Lucent relating to her departure, Russo was quoted as saying, "The company will benefit from new leadership aligned with a newly composed board to bring a fresh and independent perspective that will take Alcatel-Lucent to its next level of growth and development in a rapidly changing global market.".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/business/worldbusiness/30alcatel.html?hp Alcatel-Lucent Chiefs to Step Down], ''The New York Times'', July 29, 2008</ref> On September 2, 2008, she was replaced by [[Ben Verwaayen]].

==Other activities==
Russo spent nine months as the Chief Operations Officer (COO) of [[Eastman Kodak]], a position she left in January 2002 when she returned to Lucent to become their CEO.<ref name="light"/> She was also Chairwoman of [[Avaya]], which was spun off from Lucent. Avaya, however, filed for bankruptcy in January 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-avaya-bankruptcy-idUSKBN1532JY |title=Avaya file for bankruptcy, 2017}}</ref>

On July 23, 2009, General Motors announced that Russo would be a member of the company's new Board of Directors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/32108453 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120904032938/http://www.cnbc.com/id/32108453 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-04 |title=GM Names Its Government-Appointed Board Members |publisher=[[CNBC]] |date=2009-07-23 |accessdate=2009-08-02 }}</ref>
