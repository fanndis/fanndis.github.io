'''Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, Baron Home of the Hirsel''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=true|size=100%|KT|PC}} ({{IPAc-en|audio=Pronunciation_of_Alec_Douglas-Home.ogg|ˈ|h|juː|m}}; 2 July 1903&nbsp;– 9 October 1995) was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from October 1963 to October 1964. He was the last prime minister to hold office while a member of the [[House of Lords]], before [[Peerage Act 1963|disclaiming his peerage]] and taking up a seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for the remainder of his premiership. His reputation, however, rests more on his two spells as Britain's [[foreign minister]] than on his brief premiership.

The eldest child of [[Charles Douglas-Home, 13th Earl of Home|Charles Douglas-Home, Lord Dunglass]], he was born in 1903 at 28 [[South Street, Mayfair|South Street]] in [[Mayfair]], London,<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.notableabodes.com/person-abode-details/11903/alec-douglas-home-politician_28-south-street-mayfair-london|work=Notable Abodes |title= Alec Douglas Home|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> which his family leased from the politician and stockbroker, [[Sir Cuthbert Quilter, 1st Baronet|Sir Cuthbert Quilter]], and was the future home of [[Barbara Cartland]],<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/luxury/celebrity-homes/barbara-cartland-mayfair-40-million-valentines-day-a136701.html|title=Dame Barbara Cartland's former mansion: Queen of Romance's Mayfair townhouse goes on sale on Valentine's Day|work=Homes and Property (London Evening Standard)|first=Prudence |last=Ivey|date=14 February 2020|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> the author and socialite. Douglas-Home was educated at [[Ludgrove School]], [[Eton College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. A talented cricketer, he played [[first-class cricket]] at club and county level; he began serving in the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] from 1924. Douglas-Home (under the [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] '''Lord Dunglass''') entered Parliament in [[1931 UK general election|1931]] and served as [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s parliamentary aide, although his diagnosis in 1940 with spinal [[tuberculosis]] would immobilise him for two years. Having recovered enough to resume his political career, Douglas-Home lost his seat to Labour at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. He regained it in [[1950 UK general election|1950]], but left the Commons the following year when, on the death of his father, he entered the Lords as the '''14th Earl of Home'''. Under the next Conservative government, Home was appointed to increasingly senior posts, such as [[Leader of the House of Lords]] and [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. In the latter post (1960–63) he supported United States resolve in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and was the UK signatory of the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in August 1963.

In October 1963, [[Harold Macmillan]] resigned as Prime Minister and Douglas-Home was chosen to succeed him. By the 1960s, it was unacceptable for a prime minister to sit in the House of Lords, so Home disclaimed his [[hereditary peer]]age and successfully stood for election to Parliament as '''Sir Alec Douglas-Home'''. The manner of his appointment was controversial, and two Macmillan Cabinet ministers refused to stay in office under him. Criticised by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as an out-of-touch aristocrat, he came over stiffly in television interviews, by contrast with Labour leader [[Harold Wilson]]. As Prime Minister, Douglas-Home's demeanour and appearance remained aristocratic and old-fashioned. His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his Chancellor, [[Reginald Maudling]], free rein to handle financial affairs. He enjoyed dealing with foreign policy and his Foreign Secretary, [[Rab Butler]], was not especially energetic, but there were no major crises or issues to resolve.{{refn|group=n|Britain's application to join the [[European Economic Community]] had already been vetoed by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] had been resolved, and [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin]] was again on the back burner. [[British Empire#Decolonisation and decline (1945–1997)|Decolonisation]] issues were largely routine, and the [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Rhodesian]] and [[Disinvestment from South Africa|South African crises]] lay in the future.}} The Conservative Party, having governed for nearly twelve years, lost their standing after the scandalous [[Profumo affair]] under Macmillan and, by Douglas-Home's premiership, seemed headed for heavy electoral defeat; his premiership was the [[List of prime ministers of the United Kingdom by length of tenure|second briefest of the twentieth century]], lasting two days short of a year. Among the legislation passed under his government was the abolition of [[resale price maintenance]] in 1964.

Narrowly defeated in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 UK general election]], Douglas-Home resigned the party leadership in July 1965, having instituted a new and less secretive method for electing the leader. He later served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] (1970–1974), an expanded version of his former secretaryship. After the first of the twin Conservative defeats of 1974, he stood down at the second, the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 election]], and returned to the Lords as a [[life peer]] titled '''Baron Home of the Hirsel'''. He gradually retired from front-line politics and died in 1995, aged 92.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Douglas-Home was born in [[Mayfair]], London, the first of seven children of [[Charles Douglas-Home, 13th Earl of Home|Lord Dunglass]] (the eldest son of the [[Charles Douglas-Home, 12th Earl of Home|12th Earl of Home]]) and his wife, the Lady Lilian Lambton (daughter of the [[Frederick Lambton, 4th Earl of Durham|4th Earl of Durham]]). The boy's first name was customarily abbreviated to "Alec".{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=19}} Among the couple's younger children was the playwright [[William Douglas-Home]].<ref name=timesobit/>

In 1918 the 12th Earl of Home died, Dunglass succeeded him in the earldom, and the [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] passed to Alec Douglas-Home, who was styled Lord Dunglass until 1951.<ref>{{citation |title=Death of Lord Home |newspaper=The Times |date=1 May 1918 |page=8}}; and {{citation |title=The Earl of Home |newspaper=The Times |date=13 July 1951 |page=6}}</ref> The young Lord Dunglass was educated at [[Ludgrove School]], followed by [[Eton College]]. At Eton his contemporaries included [[Cyril Connolly]], who later described him as:
{{quote|[A] votary of the esoteric Eton religion, the kind of graceful, tolerant, sleepy boy who is showered with favours and crowned with all the laurels, who is liked by the masters and admired by the boys without any apparent exertion on his part, without experiencing the ill-effects of success himself or arousing the pangs of envy in others. In the 18th century he would have become Prime Minister before he was 30. As it was, he appeared honourably ineligible for the struggle of life.{{sfnp|ps=none|Connolly|1961|p=245}}}}

After Eton, Dunglass went to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|third-class honours]] [[Bachelor of Arts|BA degree]] in [[Modern History]] in 1925.{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=31}}
[[File:Dunglass-Eton-and-Harrow-Match-1921.jpg|thumb|left|150px|alt=young man in cricket whites at the wicket|As a member of the Eton XI, 1921]]
Dunglass was a talented sportsman. In addition to representing Eton at [[fives]],<ref>{{citation |title=Public Schools Fives |newspaper=The Times |date=24 November 1921 |page=14}}</ref> he was a capable cricketer at school, club and county level, and was unique among British prime ministers in having played [[first-class cricket]].<ref name=cricinfo/> Coached by [[George Hirst]],{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=28}} he became in [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|''Wisden'']]'s phrase "a useful member of the Eton&nbsp;XI"<ref name=cricinfo/> that included [[Percy Lawrie]] and [[Gubby Allen]].<ref>{{citation |title=Eton v. I Zingari |newspaper=The Times |date=4 July 1921 |page=7}}</ref> Wisden observed, "In the rain-affected Eton–Harrow match of 1922 he scored 66, despite being hindered by a saturated outfield, and then took 4 for 37 with his medium-paced out-swingers".<ref name=cricinfo/>

At first-class level he represented the [[Oxford University Cricket Club]], [[Middlesex County Cricket Club]] and [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC). Between 1924 and 1927 he played ten first-class matches, scoring 147 runs at an average of 16.33 with a best score of 37 not out. As a bowler he took 12 wickets at an average of 30.25 with a best of 3 for 43. Three of his first-class games were internationals against [[Argentine cricket team|Argentina]] on the MCC "representative" tour of [[South America]] in 1926–27.<ref name=cricinfo>{{Cricinfo |id=12295 |name=Sir Alec Douglas-Home <!--|accessdate=13 April 2012-->}}</ref>

Dunglass began serving in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] when in 1924 he was commissioned a [[Lieutenant (British Army)|lieutenant]] in the [[Lanarkshire Yeomanry]],<ref name="kelly's1">{{citation|title=Kelly's Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes, 1925|publisher=Kelly's|page=535}}</ref> then was promoted [[Captain (British Army)|captain]] in 1928,<ref>{{citation|title=Kelly's Handbook, 1929|page=581}}</ref> and [[Major (British Army)|major]] in 1933.<ref>{{citation|title=Kelly's Handbook, 1934|page=616}}</ref>

===Member of Parliament (1931–37)===
The courtesy title Lord Dunglass did not carry with it membership of the [[House of Lords]], and Dunglass was eligible to seek election to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Unlike many aristocratic families, the Douglas-Homes had little history of political service. Uniquely in the family the [[Cospatrick Douglas-Home, 11th Earl of Home|11th earl]], Dunglass's great-grandfather, had held government office, as [[Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Under-Secretary]] at the [[Foreign Office]] in [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s [[First Wellington ministry|1828–30 government]].{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=2}} Dunglass's father stood, reluctantly and unsuccessfully, for Parliament before succeeding to the earldom.{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=2}}

Dunglass had shown little interest in politics while at Eton or Oxford. He had not joined the [[Oxford Union]] as budding politicians usually did.{{sfnp|ps=none|Pike|1968|p=460}} However, as heir to the family estates he was doubtful about the prospect of life as a country gentleman: "I was always rather discontented with this role and felt it wasn't going to be enough."{{sfnp|ps=none|Young|1970|p=26}} His biographer David Dutton believes that Dunglass became interested in politics because of the widespread unemployment and poverty in the Scottish lowlands where his family lived.{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=5}} Later in his career, when he had become Prime Minister, Dunglass (by then Sir Alec Douglas-Home) wrote in a memorandum: "I went into politics because I felt that it was a form of public service and that as nearly a generation of politicians had been cut down in the first war those who had anything to give in the way of leadership ought to do so."{{sfnp|ps=none|Hennessy|2001|p=285}}{{refn|In the same 1963 memorandum, Home revealed more of his individual political philosophy, writing that whereas country people get "pretty close to true values", the rootless townspeople "need constant leadership. It is, however, they who have the votes..." He added: "A large part in my decision [to become PM] was the feeling that only by simple straightforward talk to the industrial masses {{sic}} could we hope to defeat the Socialists."{{sfnp|ps=none|Hennessy|2001|p=285}}|group=n}} His political thinking was influenced by that of [[Noel Skelton]], a member of the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist party]] (as the [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservatives]] were called in Scotland between 1912 and 1965). Skelton advocated "a property-owning democracy", based on share-options for workers and [[industrial democracy]].{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=6}} Dunglass was not persuaded by the socialist ideal of public ownership. He shared Skelton's view that "what everybody owns nobody owns".{{sfnp|ps=none|Young|1970|p=30}}

With Skelton's support Dunglass secured the Unionist candidacy at [[Coatbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Coatbridge]] for the 1929 general election.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=43}} It was not a seat that the Unionists expected to win, and he lost to his [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] opponent with 9,210 votes to Labour's 16,879.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=45}} It was, however, valuable experience for Dunglass, who was of a gentle and uncombative disposition and not a natural orator; he began to learn how to deal with hostile audiences and get his message across.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=44–45}} When a coalition "[[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]]" was formed in 1931 to deal with a financial crisis, Dunglass was adopted as the pro-coalition Unionist candidate for [[Lanark (UK Parliament constituency)|Lanark]]. The electorate of the area was mixed, and the constituency was not seen as a safe seat for any party; at the 1929 election Labour had captured it from the Unionists. With the backing of the pro-coalition [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal party]], which supported him rather than fielding its own candidate, Dunglass easily beat the Labour candidate.{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=7}}

Membership of the new House of Commons was overwhelmingly made up of pro-coalition MPs, and there was therefore a large number of eligible members for the government posts to be filled. In Dutton's phrase, "it would have been easy for Dunglass to have languished indefinitely in [[backbencher|backbench]] obscurity".{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=7}} However, Skelton, appointed as Under-Secretary at the [[Scottish Office]], offered Dunglass the unpaid post of unofficial parliamentary aide. This was doubly advantageous to Dunglass. Any MP appointed as official [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] (PPS) to a government minister was privy to the inner workings of government but was expected to maintain a discreet silence in the House of Commons. Dunglass achieved the first without having to observe the second.{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=7}} He made his maiden speech in February 1932 on the subject of economic policy, advocating a cautiously [[protectionism|protectionist]] approach to cheap imports. He countered Labour's objection that this would raise the cost of living, arguing that a tariff "stimulates employment and gives work [and] increases the purchasing power of the people by substituting wages for unemployment benefit".{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=53}}

During four years as Skelton's aide Dunglass was part of a team working on a wide range of issues, from medical services in rural Scotland to land settlements, fisheries, education, and industry.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=53–54}} Dunglass was appointed official PPS to Anthony Muirhead, junior minister at the [[Ministry of Labour (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Labour]], in 1935, and less than a year later became PPS to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Neville Chamberlain]].{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=57–59}}

In 1936 Dunglass married [[Elizabeth Douglas-Home|Elizabeth Alington]]; her father, [[Cyril Alington]], had been Dunglass's headmaster at Eton, and was from 1933 [[Dean of Durham]]. The service was at [[Durham Cathedral]], conducted by Alington together with [[William Temple (bishop)|William Temple]], [[Archbishop of York]] and [[Hensley Henson]], [[Bishop of Durham]].<ref name=times36>{{citation |title=Marriages{{snd}}Lord Dunglass, M.P. and Miss E. H. Alington |newspaper=The Times |date=5 October 1936 |page=15}}</ref> In addition to the large number of aristocratic guests, the household and estate staffs of the Douglas-Home properties at [[Douglas Castle]] and [[the Hirsel]] were invited.<ref name=times36/> There were four children of the marriage: Caroline, Meriel, Diana and [[David Douglas-Home, 15th Earl of Home|David]].<ref name=timesobit>{{citation |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F9248688DDA9194&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA |title=Lord Home of the Hirsel{{snd}}Obituary |newspaper=The Times |date=10 October 1995 |url-access=registration}}</ref> The last was Dunglass's heir, inheriting the earldom of Home in 1995.{{refn|Douglas-Home's biographer [[D.&nbsp;R. Thorpe]] notes that during the passage through Parliament of the Peerage Act 1963, the draft legislation originally provided that a disclaimed peerage would lapse permanently, rather than merely for the lifetime of the disclaimant. Thorpe observes that if this provision had remained a condition of disclaiming his earldom in 1963, thus preventing his son from inheriting the title in due course, Home would not have gone ahead with this important decision, and would not have become Prime Minister.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=260}}|group=n}}

===Chamberlain and war===
By the time of Dunglass's appointment Chamberlain was generally seen as the heir to the premiership.{{sfnp|ps=none|Pike|1968|p=408}} In 1937 the incumbent, [[Stanley Baldwin]], retired, and Chamberlain succeeded him. He then successfully obtained Dunglass as his PPS, a role described by the biographer [[D. R. Thorpe]] as "the right-hand man&nbsp;... the eyes and ears of Neville Chamberlain",{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=59}} and by Dutton as "liaison officer with the Parliamentary party, transmitting and receiving information and [keeping] his master informed of the mood on the government's back benches".{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=9}} This was particularly important for Chamberlain, who was often seen as distant and aloof;{{sfnp|ps=none|Young|1970|p=46}} [[Douglas Hurd]] wrote that he "lacked the personal charm which makes competent administration palatable to wayward colleagues&nbsp;– a gift which his parliamentary private secretary possessed in abundance".<ref name=dnb>{{cite ODNB|mode=cs2 |last=Hurd |first=Douglas |id=60455 |title=Home, Alexander Frederick Douglas-, fourteenth earl of Home and Baron Home of the Hirsel (1903–1995) |year=2004<!--accessed 14 April 2012-->}}</ref> Dunglass admired Chamberlain, despite his daunting personality: "I liked him, and I think he liked me. But if one went in at the end of the day for a chat or a gossip, he would be inclined to ask 'What do you want?' He was a very difficult man to get to know."<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Dutton|2006|p=9}}</ref>

As Chamberlain's aide Dunglass witnessed at first-hand the Prime Minister's attempts to prevent a second world war through [[appeasement]] of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany. When Chamberlain had his final meeting with Hitler at Munich in September 1938, Dunglass accompanied him. Having gained a short-lived extension of peace by acceding to Hitler's territorial demands at the expense of Czechoslovakia, Chamberlain was welcomed back to London by cheering crowds. Ignoring Dunglass's urging he made an uncharacteristically grandiloquent speech, claiming to have brought back "Peace with Honour" and promising "peace for our time".{{sfnmp|ps=none|1a1=Heath|1y=1998|1p=120|2a1=Thorpe|2y=1997|2pp=85–86}} These words were to haunt him when Hitler's continued aggression made war unavoidable less than a year later. Chamberlain remained Prime Minister from the outbreak of war in September 1939 until May 1940, when, in Dunglass's words, "he could no longer command support of a majority in the Conservative party".{{sfnp|ps=none|Home|1976|p=75}} After a vote in the Commons, in which the government's majority fell from more than 200 to 81, Chamberlain made way for [[Winston Churchill]]. He accepted the non-departmental post of [[Lord President of the Council]] in the new coalition government; Dunglass remained as his PPS,<ref name=dnb/> having earlier declined the offer of a ministerial post as Under-secretary at the Scottish Office.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=65}} Although Chamberlain's reputation never recovered from Munich, and his supporters such as [[Rab Butler|R A Butler]] suffered throughout their later careers from the "appeasement" tag, Dunglass largely escaped blame.{{refn|In a 1964 study of Douglas-Home John Dickie comments that Dunglass as a PPS lacked influence in decision making, and that such opprobrium as later attached to him was "guilt by association".<ref>

===Health crisis, and recovery===
Dunglass had volunteered for active military service, seeking to rejoin the [[Lanarkshire Yeomanry]]<ref name=dnb/> shortly after Chamberlain left Downing Street. The consequent medical examination revealed that Dunglass had a hole in his spine surrounded by [[tuberculosis]] in the bone. Without surgery he would have been unable to walk within a matter of months.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=109}} An innovative and hazardous operation was performed in September 1940, lasting six hours, in which the diseased bone in the spine was scraped away and replaced with healthy bone from the patient's shin.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=109}}

For all of Dunglass's humour and patience, the following two years were a grave trial. He was encased in plaster and kept flat on his back for most of that period. Although buoyed up by the sensitive support of his wife and family, as he later confessed, "I often felt that I would be better dead."{{sfnp|ps=none|Home|1976|p=86}} Towards the end of 1942 he was released from his plaster jacket and fitted with a spinal brace, and in early 1943 he was mobile for the first time since the operation.{{sfnp|ps=none|Pike|1968|p=461}} During his incapacity he read voraciously; among the works he studied were ''[[Das Kapital]]'',{{refn|According to Thorpe, Douglas-Home was the only British prime minister known to have read the work.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=115}}|group= n}} and works by [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] and [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], biographies of nineteenth and twentieth century politicians, and novels by authors from [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] to [[Arthur Koestler|Koestler]].{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=115–16}}

===Return to Commons, first ministerial post===
In July 1943 Dunglass attended the House of Commons for the first time since 1940, and began to make a reputation as a backbench member, particularly for his expertise in the field of foreign affairs.{{sfnmp|ps=none|1a1=Pike|1y=1968|1p=461|2a1=Thorpe|2y=1997|2p=121}} He foresaw a post-imperial future for Britain and emphasised the need for strong European ties after the war.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=121}} In 1944, with the war now turning in the Allies' favour, Dunglass spoke eloquently about the importance of resisting the [[Soviet Union]]'s ambition to dominate eastern Europe. His boldness in publicly urging Churchill not to give in to [[Joseph Stalin]] was widely remarked upon; many, including Churchill himself, observed that some of those once associated with appeasement were determined that it should not be repeated in the face of Russian aggression.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=124}} Labour left the wartime coalition in May 1945 and Churchill formed a caretaker Conservative government, pending a general election in July. Dunglass was appointed to his first ministerial post: [[Anthony Eden]] remained in charge of the Foreign Office, and Dunglass was appointed as one of his two Under-secretaries of State.{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=15}}

===Postwar period (1945–50)===
At the July [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] Dunglass lost his Parliamentary seat in the landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=130}} Dunglass was appointed a director of the [[Bank of Scotland]] in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=131}}

In 1950, [[Clement Attlee]], the Labour prime minister, called a general election. Dunglass was invited to stand once again as Unionist candidate for Lanark. Having been disgusted at personal attacks during the 1945 campaign by [[Tom Steele]], his Labour opponent, Dunglass did not scruple to remind the voters of Lanark that Steele had warmly thanked the Communist Party and its members for helping him take the seat from the Unionists. By 1950, with the [[Cold War]] at its height, Steele's association with the communists was a crucial electoral liability.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=134–135}} Dunglass regained the seat with one of the smallest majorities in any British constituency: 19,890 to Labour's 19,205.<ref>{{citation |title=Results of the General Election |newspaper=The Manchester Guardian |date=25 February 1950 |pages=6–8}}</ref> Labour narrowly won the general election, with a majority of 5.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thomas-Symonds|2010|p=245}}

===Succession to earldom===
[[File:The Hirsel - geograph.org.uk - 1078464.jpg|thumb|alt=exterior of large country house|right|[[The Hirsel]], the Douglas-Home family's principal residence]]
In July 1951 the 13th earl died. Dunglass succeeded him, inheriting the title of [[Earl of Home]] together with the extensive family estates, including [[The Hirsel]], the Douglas-Homes' principal residence. The new Lord Home took his seat in the Lords; a by-election was called to appoint a new MP for Lanark, but it was still pending when Attlee called another general election in October 1951.{{refn|Labour's majority of five seats was not thought large enough to sustain the party through a full five-year term in office. [[George&nbsp;VI]] was due to be absent for six months on a Commonwealth tour, and Attlee agreed that it was necessary that the King should leave behind a stable government not likely to fall in his absence. Thus, Attlee called a further election in October 1951 at a time not advantageous to his party, which was lagging behind the Conservatives in opinion polls. Labour polled more votes than the Conservatives at the election, but the British first-past-the-post electoral system nevertheless gave more seats to the Conservatives. The King's tour did not take place because of his poor health.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thomas-Symonds|2010|p=245}}|group= n}} The Unionists held Lanark, and the national result gave the Conservatives under Churchill a small but [[working majority]] of 17.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=140}}

===Rise in Cabinet===
Home was appointed to the new post of Minister of State at the Scottish Office, a middle-ranking position, senior to Under-secretary but junior to [[James Stuart, 1st Viscount Stuart of Findhorn|James Stuart]], the Secretary of State, who was a member of the cabinet. Stuart, previously an influential [[chief whip]], was a confidant of Churchill, and possibly the most powerful Scottish Secretary in any government.{{sfnmp|ps=none|1a1=Dutton|1y=2006|1p=18|2a1=Thorpe|2y=1997|2p=141}} Thorpe writes that Home owed his appointment to Stuart's advocacy rather than to any great enthusiasm on the Prime Minister's part (Churchill referred to him as "Home sweet Home").{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=141}} In addition to his ministerial position Home was appointed to membership of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]],{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=141}} an honour granted only selectively to ministers below cabinet rank.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrivyCouncil.aspx |title=Queen and Privy Council |work=Official Website of the British Monarchy |access-date= 18 April 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Royal Cypher of Queen Elizabeth II.svg|thumb|left|alt=Royal cypher consisting of a Crown above the initials E and R with the figure 2 (in Roman numerals) between them|100px|The royal cypher – a problem for Home and the Scottish Office]]
Throughout Churchill's second term as Prime Minister (1951–1955) Home remained at the Scottish Office, although both Eden at the Foreign Office and [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] at the [[Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations|Commonwealth Relations Office]] invited him to join their ministerial teams.{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=19}} Among the Scottish matters with which he dealt were hydro-electric projects, hill farming, sea transport, road transport, forestry, and the welfare of [[crofter]]s in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and the [[Outer Hebrides|Western Isles]].{{sfnmp|ps=none|1a1=Pike|1y=1968|1p=461|2a1=Thorpe|2y=1997|2p=148}} These matters went largely unreported in the British press, but the question of the [[royal cypher]] on Post Office pillar boxes became front-page news. Because [[Elizabeth I of England]] was never queen of Scotland, some nationalists maintained when [[Elizabeth&nbsp;II]] came to the British throne in 1952 that in Scotland she should be styled "Elizabeth&nbsp;I". Churchill said in the House of Commons that considering the "greatness and splendour of Scotland", and the contribution of the Scots to British and world history, "they ought to keep their silliest people in order".<ref>{{citation |title=House of Commons |newspaper=The Times |date=2 April 1953 |page=3}}</ref> Home nevertheless arranged that in Scotland new pillar boxes were decorated with the royal crown instead of the full cypher.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=151}}

When Eden succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister in 1955, he promoted Home to the cabinet as [[Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations]]. At the time of this appointment Home had not been to any of the countries within his ministerial remit, and he quickly arranged to visit [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Ceylon]].{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=21}} He had to deal with the sensitive subject of immigration from and between Commonwealth countries, where a delicate balance had to be struck between resistance in some quarters in Britain and Australia to non-white immigration on the one hand, and on the other the danger of sanctions in India and Pakistan against British commercial interests if discriminatory policies were pursued.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=169}} In most respects, however, when Home took up the appointment it seemed to be a relatively uneventful period in the history of the Commonwealth. The upheaval of Indian independence in 1947 was well in the past, and the wave of decolonising of the 1960s was yet to come.{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=20}} However, it fell to Home to maintain Commonwealth unity during the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, described by Dutton as "the most divisive in its history to date".{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=21}} Australia, New Zealand and South Africa backed the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt to regain control of the Suez Canal. [[Canada]], Ceylon, India and Pakistan all opposed it.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=178–81}}

There appeared to be a real danger that Ceylon, India and, particularly, Pakistan might leave the Commonwealth.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=178–81}} Home was firm in his support of the invasion, but used his contacts with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[V. K. Krishna Menon]], [[Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit|Nan Pandit]] and others to try to prevent the Commonwealth from breaking up.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=185}} His relationship with Eden was supportive and relaxed; he felt able, as others did not, to warn Eden of unease about Suez both internationally and among some members of the cabinet. Eden dismissed the latter as the "weak sisters";{{sfnp|ps=none|Wilby|2006|p=109}} the most prominent was [[Rab Butler]], whose perceived hesitancy over Suez on top of his support for appeasement of Hitler damaged his standing within the Conservative party.{{sfnp|ps=none|Roth|1972|pp=112–113}} When the invasion was abandoned under pressure from the US in November 1956, Home worked with the dissenting members of the Commonwealth to build the organisation into what Douglas Hurd calls "a modern multiracial Commonwealth".<ref name=dnb/>

===Macmillan's government===
Eden resigned in January 1957. In 1955 he had been the obvious successor to Churchill, but this time there was no clear heir apparent. Leaders of the Conservative party were not elected by ballot of MPs or party members, but emerged after informal soundings within the party, known as "the customary processes of consultation".{{sfnp|ps=none|Roth|1972|p=173}} The chief whip, [[Edward Heath]], canvassed the views of backbench Conservative MPs, and two senior Conservative peers, the Lord President of the Council, Lord Salisbury, and the Lord Chancellor, [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|Lord Kilmuir]], saw members of the cabinet individually to ascertain their preferences. Only one cabinet colleague supported Butler; the rest, including Home, opted for [[Harold Macmillan]]. Churchill, whom the Queen consulted, did the same.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=189}} Macmillan was appointed Prime Minister on 10 January 1957.

In the [[First Macmillan ministry|new administration]] Home remained at the Commonwealth Relations Office. Much of his time was spent on matters relating to [[Africa]], where the futures of [[Bechuanaland]] and the [[Central African Federation]] needed to be agreed. Among other matters in which he was involved were the dispute between India and Pakistan over [[Kashmir]], [[Ten Pound Poms|assisted emigration]] from Britain to Australia, and relations with [[Makarios III|Archbishop Makarios]] of [[Cyprus]]. The last unexpectedly led to an enhanced cabinet role for Home. Makarios, leader of the militant anti-British and pro-Greek movement, was detained in exile in the [[Seychelles]]. Macmillan, with the agreement of Home and most of the cabinet, decided that this imprisonment was doing more harm than good to Britain's position in Cyprus, and ordered Makarios's release. Lord Salisbury strongly dissented from the decision and resigned from the cabinet in March 1957. Macmillan added Salisbury's responsibilities to Home's existing duties, making him Lord President of the Council and [[Leader of the House of Lords]]. The first of these posts was largely honorific, but the leadership of the Lords put Home in charge of getting the government's business through the upper house, and brought him nearer to the centre of power.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=192}} In Hurd's phrase, "By the imperceptible process characteristic of British politics he found himself month by month, without any particular manoeuvre on his part, becoming an indispensable figure in the government."<ref name=dnb/>

[[File:Iain Macleod crop.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=middle-aged man, bald, speaking into a microphone|[[Iain Macleod]], who had a difficult relationship with Home]]
Home was generally warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, and there were few politicians who did not respond well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=136}} More important was [[Iain Macleod]]'s prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.{{refn|The federation consisted of [[Northern Rhodesia]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] and [[Nyasaland]]. The first and third were still colonies and came under Macleod's purview; Southern Rhodesia, which had self-government, was the responsibility of Home's department.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=196}}|group=n}}

Macleod wished to push ahead with majority rule and independence; Home believed in a more gradual approach to independence, accommodating both white minority and black majority opinions and interests. Macleod disagreed with those who warned that precipitate independence would lead the newly independent nations into "trouble, strife, poverty, dictatorship" and other evils.<ref name=frankel/> His reply was, "Would you want the Romans to have stayed on in Britain?"<ref name=frankel>{{citation |last=Frankel |first=P.&nbsp;H. |title=Iain Macleod |magazine=[[The Economist]] |date=23 October 1976 |page=4}}</ref> He threatened to resign unless he was allowed to release the leading [[Nyasaland]] activist [[Hastings Banda]] from prison, a move that Home and others thought unwise and liable to provoke distrust of Britain among the white minority in the federation.<ref name=macleod/> Macleod had his way, but by that time Home was no longer at the Commonwealth Relations Office.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=202}}

===Foreign Secretary (1960–63)===
In 1960 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Derick Heathcoat-Amory]], insisted on retiring.<ref>{{cite ODNB|mode=cs2 |last=Ramsden |first=John |id=30760 |title=Amory, Derick Heathcoat, first Viscount Amory (1899–1981) |year=2004<!--online edition, January 2011, accessed 28 April 2012-->}}</ref> Macmillan agreed with Heathcoat-Amory that the best successor at the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] would be the current Foreign Secretary, [[Selwyn Lloyd]].{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=205–206}} In terms of ability and experience the obvious candidate to take over from Lloyd at the Foreign Office was Home,<ref name=dnb/> but by 1960 there was an expectation that the Foreign Secretary would be a member of the House of Commons. The post had not been held by a peer since [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] in 1938–40; Eden had wished to appoint Salisbury in 1955, but concluded that it would be unacceptable to the Commons.{{sfnp|ps=none|Dutton|2006|p=33}}

[[File:Heathdod.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Heath]], Home's deputy at the Foreign Office. They later served in each other's cabinets.]]
After discussions with Lloyd and senior civil servants, Macmillan took the unprecedented step of appointing two Foreign Office cabinet ministers: Home, as Foreign Secretary, in the Lords, and Edward Heath, as [[Lord Privy Seal]] and deputy Foreign Secretary, in the Commons. With British application for admission to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) pending, Heath was given particular responsibility for the EEC negotiations as well as for speaking in the Commons on foreign affairs in general.{{sfnp|ps=none|Hutchinson|1980|pp=76–77}}

The opposition Labour party protested at Home's appointment; its leader, [[Hugh Gaitskell]], said that it was "constitutionally objectionable" for a peer to be in charge of the Foreign Office.{{sfnp|ps=none|Pike|1968|p=462}} Macmillan responded that an accident of birth should not be allowed to deny him the services of "the best man for the job&nbsp;– the man I want at my side".{{sfnp|ps=none|Pike|1968|p=462}} Hurd comments, "Like all such artificial commotions it died down after a time (and indeed was not renewed with any strength nineteen years later when [[Margaret Thatcher]] appointed another peer, [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], to the same post)."<ref name=dnb/> The Home–Heath partnership worked well. Despite their different backgrounds and ages&nbsp;– Home an [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] aristocrat and Heath a lower-middle class meritocrat raised in the inter-war years&nbsp;– the two men respected and liked one another. Home supported Macmillan's ambition to get Britain into the EEC, and was happy to leave the negotiations in Heath's hands.<ref name=dnb/>

Home's attention was mainly concentrated on the [[Cold War]], where his forcefully expressed anti-communist beliefs were tempered by a pragmatic approach to dealing with the Soviet Union. His first major problem in this sphere was in 1961 when on the orders of the Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], the [[Berlin Wall]] was erected to stop [[East Germany|East Germans]] escaping to [[West Germany]] via [[West Berlin]]. Home wrote to his American counterpart, [[Dean Rusk]], "The prevention of East Berliners getting into West Berlin has never been a ''casus belli'' for us. We are concerned with Western access to Berlin and that is what we must maintain."{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=227}} The governments of West Germany, Britain and the US quickly reached agreement on their joint negotiating position; it remained to persuade [[Charles de Gaulle|President de Gaulle]] of France to align himself with the allies. During their discussions Macmillan commented that de Gaulle showed "all the rigidity of a poker without its occasional warmth".{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=228}} An agreement was reached, and the allies tacitly recognised that the wall was going to remain in place. The Soviets for their part did not seek to cut off allied access to West Berlin through East German territory.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=229}}

The following year the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] threatened to turn the Cold War into a nuclear one. Soviet nuclear missiles were brought to Cuba, provocatively close to the US. The American president, [[John F. Kennedy|John F Kennedy]], insisted that they must be removed, and many thought that the world was on the brink of catastrophe with nuclear exchanges between the two super-powers.{{sfnp|ps=none|Divine|1971|pp=40–41 and 49}}  Despite a public image of unflappable calm, Macmillan was by nature nervous and highly strung.<ref name=dnb/> During the missile crisis, Home, whose calm was genuine and innate, strengthened the Prime Minister's resolve, and encouraged him to back up Kennedy's defiance of Soviet threats of nuclear attack.<ref name=dnb/>  The Lord Chancellor ([[Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne|Lord Dilhorne]]), the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] ([[John Hobson (politician)|Sir John Hobson]]) and the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]], ([[Peter Rawlinson, Baron Rawlinson of Ewell|Sir Peter Rawlinson]]) privately gave Home their opinion that the American blockade of Cuba was a breach of international law,{{refn|The legality of US actions in the crisis, including the blockade of Cuba, has subsequently been questioned by American writers specialising in law, including [[Abram Chayes]] in ''The Cuban Missile Crisis: International Crises and the Role of Law'', and [[Stephen Shalom]] in ''International Lawyers and Other Apologists: The Case of the Cuban Missile Crisis''.

{{quote|There has been a good deal of speculation about Russia's motives. To me they are quite clear. Their motive was to test the will of the United States and to see how the President of the United States, in particular, would react against a threat of force.

The principal landmark of Home's term as Foreign Secretary was also in the sphere of east–west relations: the negotiation and signature of the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963. He got on well with his American and Soviet counterparts, Rusk and [[Andrei Gromyko]]. The latter wrote that whenever he met Home there were "no sudden, still less brilliant, breakthroughs" but "each meeting left a civilised impression that made the next meeting easier". Gromyko concluded that Home added sharpness to British foreign policy.{{sfnp|ps=none|Gromyko|1989|p=159}} Gromyko, Home and Rusk signed the treaty in Moscow on 5 August 1963.<ref name=timesban>{{citation |title=Three Ministers Sign Test Ban Treaty in Moscow |newspaper=The Times |date=6 August 1963 |page=8}}</ref> After the fear provoked internationally by the Cuban Missile Crisis, the ban on nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water was widely welcomed as a step towards ending the cold war.<ref name=timesban/> For the British government the good news from Moscow was doubly welcome for drawing attention away from the [[Profumo affair]], a sexual scandal involving [[John Profumo|a senior minister]], which had left Macmillan's administration looking vulnerable.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=267}}

===Successor to Macmillan===

In October 1963, just before the Conservative party's annual conference, Macmillan was taken ill with a [[prostate|prostatic obstruction]]. The condition was at first thought more serious than it turned out to be, and he announced that he would resign as Prime Minister as soon as a successor was appointed. Three senior politicians were considered likely successors, 'Rab' Butler ([[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[First Secretary of State]]), [[Reginald Maudling]] (Chancellor of the Exchequer) and [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham]] (Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords). ''[[The Times]]'' summed up their support:

In the same article, Home was mentioned in passing as "a fourth hypothetical candidate" on whom the party could compromise if necessary.<ref name=t63/>

It was assumed in the ''Times'' article, and by other commentators, that if Hailsham (or Home) was a candidate he would have to renounce his peerage.<ref name=t63/> This had been made possible for the first time by recent legislation.{{refn|If Macmillan had resigned a year earlier or a year later, neither Hailsham nor Home could have been candidates for the succession.

By 1923, having to choose between Baldwin and [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], [[George&nbsp;V]] decided that "the requirements of the present times" obliged him to appoint a prime minister from the Commons. His private secretary recorded that the King "believed he would not be fulfilling his trust were he now to make his selection of Prime Minister from the House of Lords".<ref>[[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Lord Stamfordham]], ''quoted'' in {{harvp|Wilson|1976|p=9}}</ref> Similarly, after the resignation of Neville Chamberlain in 1940 there were two likely successors, Churchill and Halifax, but the latter ruled himself out for the premiership on the grounds that his membership of the House of Lords disqualified him.{{sfnp|ps=none|Churchill|1985|pp=596–598}} In 1963, therefore, it was well established that the prime minister should be a member of the House of Commons.<ref name=timesobit/> On 10 October Hailsham announced his intention to renounce his viscountcy.<ref>{{citation |title=Mr. Macmillan Decides to Resign Soon{{snd}}Lord Hailsham to Renounce his Title |newspaper=The Times |date=11 October 1963 |page=12}}</ref>

The "customary processes" once again took place. The usual privacy of the consultations was made impossible because they took place during the party conference, and the potential successors made their bids very publicly. Butler had the advantage of giving the party leader's keynote address to the conference in Macmillan's absence, but was widely thought to have wasted the opportunity by delivering an uninspiring speech.{{sfnp|ps=none|Howard|1987|pp=313–314}} Hailsham put off many potential backers by his extrovert, and some thought vulgar, campaigning.<ref>{{citation |author-link=Paul Johnson (writer)|last=Johnson|first= Paul |title=The very image of a laird |work=[[The Times Literary Supplement]] |date=15 October 1976}}</ref> Maudling, like Butler, made a speech that failed to impress the conference. Senior Conservative figures such as [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]] and Selwyn Lloyd urged Home to make himself available for consideration.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=299–300}}

Having ruled himself out of the race when the news of Macmillan's illness broke, Home angered at least two of his cabinet colleagues by changing his mind.<ref name=timesobit/> Macmillan quickly came to the view that Home would be the best choice as his successor, and gave him valuable behind-the-scenes backing. He let it be known that if he recovered he would be willing to serve as a member of a Home cabinet.<ref>{{citation |last=Arnold-Foster |first=Mark |title=Home in the lead{{snd}}'Macmillan would serve under him' |newspaper=The Observer |date=13 October 1963 |page=1}}</ref> He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he learned from [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech]], the British ambassador to the United States, that the [[Kennedy administration]] was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as Prime Minister,{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=300–01}} and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=303–05}}

Butler, by contrast, was seen as on the liberal wing of the Conservatives, and his election as leader might split the party.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=303–05}} The Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, conducted a poll of cabinet members, and reported to Macmillan that taking account of first and second preferences there were ten votes for Home, four for Maudling, three for Butler and two for Hailsham.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=307}}{{refn|In 1980 a biographer of Macmillan, George Hutchinson, expressed strong doubt about the reliability of Dilhorne's figures.{{sfnp|ps=none|Hutchinson|1980|pp=139–140}}|group= n}}

The appointment of a prime minister remained part of the [[royal prerogative]], on which the monarch had no constitutional duty to consult an outgoing prime minister. Nevertheless, Macmillan advised the Queen that he considered Home the right choice.{{sfnp|ps=none|Pike|1968|pp=462–463}} Little of this was known beyond the senior ranks of the party and the royal secretariat.

Home's cabinet colleagues [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Iain Macleod]], who disapproved of his candidacy, made a last-minute effort to prevent him from taking office by trying to persuade Butler and the other candidates not to take posts in a Home cabinet.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=312–313}} Butler, however, believed it to be his duty to serve in the cabinet;<ref name=dnb/> he refused to have any part in the conspiracy, and accepted the post of Foreign Secretary.{{sfnp|ps=none|Howard|1987|p=321}} The other candidates followed Butler's lead and only Powell and Macleod held out and refused office under Home.{{sfnp|ps=none|Howard|1987|p=321}} Macleod commented, "One does not expect to have many people with one in the last ditch."<ref name=macleod>{{cite ODNB|mode=cs2 |last=Goldsworthy |first=David |id=34788 |title=Macleod, Iain Norman (1913–1970) |year=2004<!--online edition, January 2011, accessed 21 April 2012-->}}</ref> On 19 October Home was able to return to [[Buckingham Palace]] to [[kissing hands|kiss hands]] as Prime Minister.{{sfnp|ps=none|Pike|1968|p=463}} The press was not only wrong-footed by the appointment, but generally highly critical.

In January 1964 Macleod, now editor of ''[[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]]'', used the pretext of a [[The Spectator (1828)#"The Tory Leadership" article|review of a book]] by [[Randolph Churchill]] to publicise his own different and very detailed version of the leadership election.

On 23 October 1963, four days after becoming Prime Minister, Home disclaimed his earldom and associated lesser peerages, under the [[Peerage Act 1963]].{{refn| The subordinate titles were the lordship of Dunglass, the lordship of Home, the lordship of Hume of Berwick, the barony of Douglas and the barony of Hume of Berwick.{{sfnp|ps=none|Pike|1968|p=463}}<ref>{{citation |last=Boyd |first=Francis |author2= Norman Shrapnel |title=Stumbling into Number 10 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 October 1995 |page=15}}</ref>|group= n}} Having been made a knight of the [[Order of the Thistle]] in 1962, he was known after stepping down from the Lords as Sir Alec Douglas-Home.<ref name=dnb/> The safe Unionist seat of [[Kinross and Western Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Kinross and West Perthshire]] was vacant following the sudden death of [[Gilmour Leburn]] and the candidate initially adopted, [[George Younger, 4th Viscount Younger of Leckie|George Younger]], agreed to stand aside.

[[File:Dodwilson.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Middle-aged man in profile, clean shaven, full head of greying hair|[[Harold Wilson]], an opponent of Douglas-Home]]
The Parliamentary leader of the opposition Labour party, [[Harold Wilson]], attacked the new prime minister as "an elegant anachronism". He asserted that nobody from Douglas-Home's background knew of the problems of ordinary families. In particular, Wilson demanded to know how "a scion of an effete establishment" could lead the technological revolution that Wilson held to be necessary: "This is the counter-revolution&nbsp;... After half a century of democratic advance, of social revolution, the whole process has ground to a halt with a fourteenth earl!"{{sfnp|ps=none|Pike|1968|p=463}} Douglas-Home pooh-poohed this as [[Snob#inverted snobbery|inverted snobbery]], and observed, "I suppose Mr Wilson, when you come to think of it, is the fourteenth Mr Wilson."<ref name=dnb/>{{sfnp|ps=none|Pimlott|1992|p=3}} He called Wilson "this slick salesman of synthetic science" and the Labour party "the only relic of class consciousness in the country".<ref>{{citation |title=Fighting Reply from Prime Minister |newspaper=The Times |date=21 January 1964 |page=10}}</ref> The opposition retreated, with a statement in the press that "The Labour Party is not interested in the fact that the new prime minister inherited a fourteenth Earldom&nbsp;– he cannot help his antecedents any more than the rest of us."<ref>{{citation |title=The New Prime Minister |newspaper=The Times |date=23 October 1963 |page=11}}</ref>

Douglas-Home inherited from Macmillan a government widely perceived as in decline; Hurd wrote that it was "becalmed in a sea of satire and scandal."<ref name=dnb/> Douglas-Home was the target of satirists on [[BBC television]] and in ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine.{{refn|''Private Eye'' persistently referred to Douglas-Home as "Baillie Vass".

In international affairs the most dramatic event during Douglas-Home's premiership was the [[assassination of President Kennedy]] in November 1963. Douglas-Home broadcast a tribute on television.<ref>{{citation |title=Carried the hopes of the world |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 November 1963 |page=3}}</ref> He had liked and worked well with Kennedy, and did not develop such a satisfactory relationship with [[Lyndon Johnson]].

In Britain there was economic prosperity; exports "zoomed", according to ''The Times'', and the economy was growing at an annual rate of four per cent.<ref>{{citation |title=Year of Disillusion and Change |newspaper=The Times |date=31 December 1963 |page=13}}</ref> Douglas-Home made no pretence to economic expertise; he commented that his problems were of two sorts: "The political ones are insoluble and the economic ones are incomprehensible."<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/past-prime-ministers/sir-alec-douglas-home-2/ |work=Past Prime Ministers |title=Sir Alec Douglas-Home |publisher=British Prime Minister's Office |accessdate= 30 April 2012}}</ref> On another occasion he said, "When I have to read economic documents I have to have a box of matches and start moving them into position to simplify and illustrate the points to myself."<ref>

The latter took the lead in the one substantial piece of domestic legislation of Douglas-Home's premiership, the abolition of [[resale price maintenance]].<ref name=dnb/>

The [[Resale Prices Act 1964|Resale Prices Bill]] was introduced to deny manufacturers and suppliers the power to stipulate the prices at which their goods must be sold by the retailer. At the time, up to forty per cent of goods sold in Britain were subject to such price fixing, to the detriment of competition and to the disadvantage of the consumer.<ref name=rpm/> Douglas-Home, less instinctively liberal on economic matters than Heath, would probably not have sponsored such a proposal unprompted.<ref name=dnb/> However, he gave Heath his backing, in the face of opposition from some cabinet colleagues, including Butler, Hailsham and Lloyd,{{sfnp|ps=none|Roth|1972|p=176}} and a substantial number of Conservative backbenchers.

The bill received the [[royal assent]] in July 1964, but did not become operative until 1965, by which time Douglas-Home, Heath and their colleagues were out of office.<ref>{{citation |title=Resale Act Soon Operative |newspaper=The Times |date=16 January 1965 |page=6}}</ref>

A plot to kidnap Douglas-Home in April 1964 was foiled by the Prime Minister himself. Two left-wing students from the [[University of Aberdeen]] followed him to the house of [[John Buchan, 2nd Baron Tweedsmuir|John]] and [[Priscilla Buchan, Baroness Tweedsmuir of Belhelvie|Priscilla Buchan]], where he was staying. He was alone at the time and answered the door, where the students told him that they planned to kidnap him. He responded, "I suppose you realise if you do, the Conservatives will win the election by 200 or 300." He gave his intending abductors some beer, and they abandoned their plot.{{refn|Douglas-Home never publicly spoke of the kidnapping because he did not want to ruin the career of his bodyguard but told the story in 1977 to Hailsham, who recorded it in his diaries.<ref>{{citation |last=Pierce |first=Andrew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1585069/How-Alec-Douglas-Home-foiled-student-kidnappers-with-beer.html |title=How Alec Douglas-Home foiled student kidnappers with beer |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=14 April 2008}}</ref> In July 2009 [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast a dramatisation of the event entitled ''The Night They Tried to Kidnap the Prime Minister'', written by Martin Jameson and starring [[Tim McInnerny]] as Douglas-Home.<ref>{{citation |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=12962AD6A036DB50&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA |title=Afternoon Play |newspaper=The Times |date=11 July 2009 |url-access=registration}}</ref>|group= n}}

The term of the Parliament elected in 1959 was due to expire in October 1964. Parliament was dissolved on 25 September and after three weeks of campaigning the [[1964 United Kingdom general election]] took place on 15 October. Douglas-Home's speeches dealt with the future of the nuclear deterrent, while fears of Britain's relative decline in the world, reflected in chronic balance of payment problems, helped the Labour Party's case.{{sfnp|ps=none|Young|2007}} The Conservatives under Douglas-Home did much better than widely predicted, but Labour under Wilson won with a narrow majority.

===In Opposition (1964–70)===
As Leader of the Opposition, Douglas-Home persuaded Macleod and Powell to rejoin the Conservative front bench. Within weeks of the general election Butler retired from politics, accepting the post of Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] together with a life peerage.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=376}} Douglas-Home did not immediately allocate [[Shadow Cabinet|shadow]] portfolios to his colleagues, but in January 1965 he gave Maudling the foreign affairs brief and Heath became spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=378}} There was no immediate pressure for Douglas-Home to hand over the leadership to a member of the younger generation, but by early 1965 a new Conservative group called PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism) had discreetly begun to call for a change.{{sfnp|ps=none|Roth|1972|p=180}} Douglas-Home either did not know, or chose to ignore, the fact that Heath had made a donation to PEST. He decided that the time was coming for him to retire as leader, with Heath as his preferred successor.{{sfnp|ps=none|Roth|1972|pp=180–182}}

[[File:Enoch Powell Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An elderly man with full head of hair and small moustache, staring into the camera|upright|[[Enoch Powell]] returned to the Conservative front bench in 1964 and later sought the party leadership.]]
Determined that the party should abandon the "customary processes of consultation", which had caused such rancour when he was appointed in 1963, Douglas-Home set up an orderly process of secret balloting by Conservative MPs for the election of his immediate and future successors as party leader. In the interests of impartiality the ballot was organised by the [[1922 Committee]], the backbench Conservative MPs.{{sfnp|ps=none|Roth|1972|pp=184–185}}  Douglas-Home announced his resignation as Conservative leader on 22 July 1965. Three candidates stood in the [[1965 Conservative Party leadership election]]: Heath, Maudling and Powell. Heath won with 150 votes (one of them cast by Douglas-Home) to 133 for Maudling and 15 for Powell.{{sfnp|ps=none|Roth|1972|p=186}}

Douglas-Home accepted the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath's shadow cabinet. Many expected this to be a short-lived appointment, a prelude to Douglas-Home's retirement from politics.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=392}} It came at a difficult time in British foreign relations: events in the [[self-governing colony]] of [[Rhodesia]] (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally erupted into open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to black majority rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared]] independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of left-wing Labour MPs such as [[Tony Benn|Wedgwood Benn]] for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on the right wing of the Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels on racial grounds.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=392}}

In 1966 Douglas-Home became president of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), which was then the governing body of English and world cricket. The presidency had generally been a largely ceremonial position, but Douglas-Home became embroiled in two controversies, one of them with international implications.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=396–399}}  This was the so-called "[[D'Oliveira affair]]", in which the inclusion of a non-white player in the England team to tour South Africa led to the cancellation of the tour by the [[apartheid]] regime in [[Pretoria]]. In his account of the affair, the political journalist [[Peter Oborne]] criticises Douglas-Home for his vacillating attitude towards South African Prime Minister [[John Vorster]] with whom, says Oborne, "he was no more robust than Chamberlain had been with Hitler thirty years earlier".{{sfnp|ps=none|Oborne|2004|pp=138–139}} Douglas-Home's advice to the MCC committee not to press the South Africans for advance assurances on D'Oliveira's acceptability, and his optimistic assurances that all would be well, became a matter of much criticism from a group of MCC members led by [[David Sheppard|the Rev David Sheppard]].{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=396–399}} The second controversy was not one of race but of social class. [[Brian Close]] was dropped as England captain in favour of [[Colin Cowdrey]]. Close was dropped after using delaying tactics when captaining [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] in a county match, but the move was widely seen as biased towards cricketers from the old amateur tradition,<ref name=reyburn/> which had officially ended in 1963.{{refn|Until 1963 those taking part in first-class cricket were classed as "Gentlemen" (amateurs) or "Players" (professionals).<ref>{{citation |title=End of Amateurs in Cricket |newspaper=The Times |date=1 February 1963 |page=4}}</ref> Amateurs had long dominated the running of the game.

Wilson's small majority after the 1964 general election had made the transaction of government business difficult, and in 1966 he called another election in which Labour gained a strong working majority of 96. Some older members of Heath's team, including Lloyd, retired from the front bench, making room for members of the next generation.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=393}} Heath moved Maudling to the foreign affairs portfolio, and Douglas-Home took over Lloyd's responsibilities as spokesman on Commonwealth relations.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=393}} Heath was widely seen as ineffective against Wilson, and as the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] approached there was concern within the party that he would lose, and that Powell would seek to replace him as leader. Maudling and the chief whip, [[William Whitelaw]], believed that if Heath had to resign Douglas-Home would be the safest candidate to keep Powell out.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=402–03}} Douglas-Home shared their view that Labour would win the 1970 election, and that Heath might then have to resign, but he declined to commit himself. To the surprise of almost everyone except Heath, the Conservatives won the election, with a majority of 31 seats.{{sfnp|ps=none|Roth|1972|p=209}}

Douglas-Home received an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate]] from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1966.<ref>{{citation |title=Honorary Degrees Working Group |publisher=Heriot-Watt University |url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm |website=www.hw.ac.uk |location=Edinburgh|accessdate=11 April 2016}}</ref>

===Foreign and Commonwealth secretary (1970–74)===
Heath invited Douglas-Home to join the cabinet, taking charge of Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. In earlier centuries it had not been exceptional for a former prime minister to serve in the cabinet of a successor, and even in the previous fifty years [[Arthur Balfour]], Stanley Baldwin, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and Neville Chamberlain had done so.{{refn| Prime ministers who served under one or more of their successors included: [[the Duke of Grafton]] under [[Frederick North, Lord North|North]],{{sfnp|ps=none|Pike|1968|p=103}} [[the Duke of Portland]] under [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]],{{sfnp|ps=none|Pike|1968|p=127}} [[Henry Addington|Addington]] under [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Grenville]],{{sfnp|ps=none|Pike|1968|p=151}} [[F.

H. Asquith|Asquith]]'s cabinet in 1916, [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], who had been Prime Minister in 1894–95, said that having an ex-premier in the cabinet was "a fleeting and dangerous luxury".{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=404}} Thorpe writes that Heath's appointment of Douglas-Home "was not a luxury but an essential buttress to his administration".{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=404}}

The Wilson administration had merged the Colonial Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office in 1966 into the [[Commonwealth Office]],<ref>{{citation |title=An Honourable Record |newspaper=The Times |date=30 July 1966 |page=9}}</ref> which, two years later, was merged with the Foreign Office, to form the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] (FCO).<ref>{{citation |last=Wood |first=David |title=Ministers in merger dilemma |newspaper=The Times |date=17 October 1968 |page= 1}}</ref> Heath appointed Douglas-Home to head the department, with, once again, a second cabinet minister, this time [[Anthony Barber]], principally responsible, as Heath had been in the 1960s, for negotiations on Britain's joining the EEC. This time, however, both ministers were in the Commons; Barber's cabinet post was officially [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]].<ref>{{citation |last=Wood |first=David |title=The new Cabinet |newspaper=The Times |date=22 June 1970 |page=10}}</ref>

Within weeks of the election Barber was moved from the FCO to the Treasury to take over as Chancellor from Iain Macleod, who died suddenly on 20 July. Though they had never enjoyed an easy relationship, Douglas-Home recognised his colleague's stature, and felt his loss politically as well as personally.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=405}} Some commentators have maintained that Macleod's death and replacement by the less substantial figure of Barber fatally undermined the economic success of the Heath government.<ref>{{harvp|Maitland|1996|p=178}}; {{citation |title=Without Roy Jenkins |magazine=The Economist |date=18 September 1976 |page=14}}; and {{citation |title=Macleod in power |magazine=The Economist |date=15 December 1990 |page=36}}</ref>

Barber was replaced at the FCO by [[Geoffrey Rippon]], who handled the day-to-day negotiations, under the direction of Heath. Douglas-Home, as before, concentrated on east–west and Commonwealth matters. He was in agreement with Heath's policy on the EEC, and did much to persuade doubters on the right wing of the Conservative party of the desirability of Britain's entry. Hurd writes:
{{quote|By temperament and background he was some distance removed from Heath's passionate commitment to a united Europe. All the more important was his steadfast support for British entry, which he based on a clear assessment of Britain's place in the modern world, and in particular her relationship with France and Germany on the one hand and the United States on the other&nbsp;... thus providing the right of the Conservative Party with much needed assurance.<ref name=dnb/>|}}

In east–west relations, Douglas-Home continued his policy of keeping the Soviet Union at bay. In September 1971, after receiving no satisfactory results from negotiations with Gromyko about the flagrant activities of the [[KGB]] in Britain, he expelled 105 Soviet diplomats for spying.<ref name=thaw/> In addition to the furore arising from this,<ref name=leapman>{{citation |last=Leapman |first=Michael |title=Gromyko threat of reprisals on diplomats fails to sway Sir Alec |newspaper=The Times |date=28 September 1971 |page=1}}</ref> the Soviets felt that the British government's approach to negotiations on détente in Europe was over-cautious, even sceptical.<ref name=thaw/> Gromyko was nonetheless realistic enough to maintain a working relationship with the British government.<ref name=leapman/> Within days of the expulsions from London he and Douglas-Home met and discussed the Middle East and disarmament.<ref name=leapman/> In this sphere of foreign policy, Douglas-Home was widely judged a success.<ref name=thaw>{{citation |title=Thaw in Anglo-Soviet Relations |newspaper=The Times |date=4 December 1973 |page=17}}</ref>

In negotiations on the future of Rhodesia Douglas-Home was less successful. He was instrumental in persuading the rebel leader, [[Ian Smith]], to accept proposals for a transition to African majority rule.<ref>{{citation |last=Wood |first=David |title=Commons triumph for Sir Alec but Labour promise Rhodesia battle |newspaper=The Times |date=26 November 1971 |page=1}}</ref> Douglas-Home set up an independent commission chaired by a senior British judge, [[Edward Pearce, Baron Pearce|Lord Pearce]], to investigate how acceptable the proposals were to majority opinion in Rhodesia. After extensive fieldwork throughout Rhodesia, the commission reported, "We are satisfied on our evidence that the proposals are acceptable to the great majority of Europeans. We are equally satisfied&nbsp;... that the majority of Africans rejected the proposals. In our opinion the people of Rhodesia as a whole do not regard the proposals as acceptable as a basis for independence."<ref>{{citation |title=Decision genuine expression of African opinion |newspaper=The Times |date=24 May 1972 |page=8}}</ref> To Douglas-Home's disappointment there was no resolution, and Rhodesia remained a rebel regime long after he left office.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=428}}

===Retirement and death (1974–95)===
[[File:Alec Douglas-Home, by Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|left|alt=head and shoulders image of clean shaven, slim, bald man of mature years; the same man in the picture at the head of the page|Home, photographed by [[Allan Warren]], in 1986]]
At the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] the Heath government was narrowly defeated. Douglas-Home, then aged 70, stepped down at the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|second election]] of that year, called in October by the minority Labour government in the hope of winning a working majority. He returned to the House of Lords at the end of 1974 when he accepted a [[life peer]]age, becoming known as Baron Home of [[the Hirsel]], of [[Coldstream]] in the [[County of Berwick]].<ref>{{London Gazette|mode=cs2 |date=24 December 1974 |issue=46441 |pages=1–2}}</ref>

Between 1977 and 1989 Home was Governor of [[I Zingari]], the nomadic cricket team.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=463}} In retirement he published three books:  ''The Way The Wind Blows'' (1976), described by Hurd as "a good-natured autobiography, with perhaps more anecdotes than insights", ''Border Reflections'' (1979),{{sfnp|ps=none|Home|1979|loc=''[[passim]]''}} and his correspondence with his grandson [[Matthew Darby]], ''Letters to a Grandson'' (1983).{{sfnp|ps=none|Home|1983|loc=''passim''}} In the 1980s Home increasingly spent his time in Scotland, with his family. He was a keen fisherman and enjoyed shooting. Hurd writes that "there was no sudden moment when he abandoned politics", rather that "his interventions became fewer and fewer".<ref name=dnb/> His last speech in the House of Lords was in 1989, when he spoke against Hurd's proposals for prosecuting war criminals living in Britain: "After such a lapse of time justice might not be seen to be done. It would be dangerous to rely on memories of events that occurred so long ago. It was too late to reopen the issue."<ref>{{citation |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F91039F75C28CC3&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA |title=Hitler must not have posthumous victory, peers told |newspaper=The Times |date=5 December 1989 |url-access=registration}}</ref>  His withdrawal from public affairs became more marked after the death of his wife in 1990, after 54 years of marriage.<ref name=dnb/>

Home died at the Hirsel in October 1995 when he was 92, four months after the death of his parliamentary opponent [[Harold Wilson]]. These two former prime ministers have the distinction of being the only ones who were both born in and died in the 20th century. Home was buried in Lennel churchyard, Coldstream.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|pp=463–464}}

==Reputation==
[[File:Sir Alec Douglas-Home (geograph 3131225).jpg|thumb|Statue of Douglas-Home at [[The Hirsel]] by sculptor Professor Bill Scott, unveiled in 1998.<ref>{{citation|title=Sir Alec Douglas-Home Memorial|publisher=Bill Scott Estate|url=http://billscottsculptor.co.uk/project/sir-alec-douglas-home/|access-date=5 February 2018}}</ref>]]
Home's premiership was short and not conspicuous for radical innovation. Hurd remarks, "He was not capable of Macmillan's flights of imagination", but he was an effective practical politician.<ref name=dnb/> At the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Foreign Office he played an important role in helping to manage Britain's transition from imperial power to European partner. Both Thorpe and Hurd quote a memo that Macmillan wrote in 1963, intended to help the Queen choose his successor:
{{quote|Lord Home is clearly a man who represents the old governing class at its best&nbsp;... He is not ambitious in the sense of wanting to scheme for power, although not foolish enough to resist honour when it comes to him&nbsp;... He gives that impression by a curious mixture of great courtesy, and even if yielding to pressure, with underlying rigidity on matters of principle. It is interesting that he has proved himself so much liked by men like President Kennedy and Mr Rusk and Mr Gromyko. This is exactly the quality that the class to which he belongs have at their best because they think about the question under discussion and not about themselves.{{sfnp|ps=none|Thorpe|1997|p=301}} }}

Douglas Hurd, once Home's private secretary, and many years later his successor (after seven intermediate holders of the post) as Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, wrote this personal comment: "The three most courteous men I knew in politics were Lord Home, [[King Hussein of Jordan]], and President [[Nelson Mandela]]. All three had ease of birth, in the sense that they never needed to worry about who they themselves were and so had more time to concern themselves with the feelings of others."<ref name=dnb/>

Although some in the Conservative party agreed with Wilson (and [[Jo Grimond]], the Liberal leader) that the Conservatives would have won the 1964 election if Butler had been Prime Minister, ''The Times'' observed, "it should not be overlooked that in October 1963 Home took over a Government whose morale was shattered and whose standing in the opinion polls was abysmal. A year later Labour won the general election, with an overall majority of only four seats. That [Home] recovered so much ground in so short a time was in itself an achievement." However, looking back across Home's career, ''The Times'' considered that his reputation rested not on his brief premiership, but on his two spells as Foreign Secretary: "He brought to the office&nbsp;... his capacity for straight talking, for toughness towards the Soviet Union and for firmness (sometimes interpreted as a lack of sympathy) towards the countries of Africa and Asia. But he brought something else as well: an unusual degree of international respect."<ref name=timesobit/>
