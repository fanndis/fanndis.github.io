'''Colgate University''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Hamilton, New York]].  The college was founded in 1819 as the Baptist Education Society of the State of New York and operated under that name until 1823, when it was renamed Hamilton Theological and Literary Institution, often called Hamilton College (1823–1846), then Madison College (1846–1890), and its present name since 1890. Colgate now enrolls nearly 3,000 students in 56 undergraduate majors that culminate in a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.colgate.edu/academics/majors-minors|title=Majors & Minors &#124; Colgate University|website=www.colgate.edu}}</ref> It is part of the [[Patriot League]] athletic conference.

== History ==
[[File:Colgate University Campus Aerial.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The Colgate University campus in Hamilton, NY]]

In 1817, the Baptist Education Society of the [[New York (state)|State of New York]] was founded by thirteen men (six clergymen and seven laymen). Two years later, in 1819, the state granted the school's charter, and the school opened a year later, in 1820.<ref name="history-traditions">{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/about/past-present-and-future|title=Traditions and History of Colgate University|publisher=Colgate University|accessdate=2013-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820071228/http://www.colgate.edu/about/past-present-and-future|archive-date=2013-08-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first classes were held in a building in the town of Hamilton. Three years later, in 1823, the Baptist Theological Seminary at New York City incorporated with the Baptist Education Society and subsequently changed its name to the Hamilton Literary & Theological Institution.<ref name="time-colgate">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743290,00.html|title= Education: Long Yell For Jimmy|date=1932-03-07|magazine=Time|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> Among the trustees was [[William Colgate]], founder of the [[Colgate-Palmolive|Colgate Company]].<ref name="time-colgate" />

In 1826, the school's trustees bought farmland that later became the focal point of the campus, known as 'The Hill'. One year later, the current students and faculty of the school built West Hall,  by using stone taken from a quarry found on the land. Originally called West Edifice before being renamed to West Hall, it is the oldest structure on campus.<ref name="West Hall">{{cite web|url=http://www4.colgate.edu/scene/nov1999/west/ |title=West Hall is Colgate's oldest building|publisher=The Colgate Scene|accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> On March 26, 1846, the State of New York granted a college charter to Hamilton's Collegiate Department; in the two years prior to that, at the request of Hamilton Trustees, degrees of forty-five Bachelor's students and at least one Master's candidate were awarded by Columbian College in Washington, D.C. (now the [[George Washington University]]), a fellow Baptist institution.<ref>Elmer Kayser, ''Bricks without Straw: The Evolution of George Washington University'' (New York: 1970), pp. 92-93.</ref> In 1846, the school changed its name to Madison University.<ref name="history-traditions" /> In 1850, the Baptist Education Society planned to move the university to [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], but was halted by legal action. Dissenting trustees, faculty, and students founded the [[University of Rochester]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=2308|title=University of Rochester History: Chapter 2|publisher=University of Rochester|accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> Another group of Baptist dissenters, calling for an end to racial and gender discrimination, had founded [[New-York Central College]] in 1849.

In 1890, Madison University changed its name to Colgate University in recognition of the family and its gifts to the school.<ref name="americana">{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia Americana|publisher=The Encyclopedia Americana Corporation|year=1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2cMAAAAYAAJ&q=%22colgate%20university%22%20%22madison%20university%22&pg=PA250}}</ref> [[James Boorman Colgate|James B.

=== Coeducation ===
From its inception the institution was an all-male institution, but started to see female students attend in a limited capacity as early as the mid-1800s when Emily Taylor, daughter of then-president Stephen W. Taylor (1851–56), attended her father’s moral philosophy class.<ref name="auto">{{cite news|url=https://200.colgate.edu/looking-back/moments/enter-women-students|title=Enter Women Students|date=2019-01-01|publisher=Colgate University|accessdate=2019-04-24}}</ref>

The institution’s first full-time female student was Mabel Dart (later Colegrove), who participated in classes from 1878–1882. At the time, university officials deemed it best that a female student not be embarrassed by graduating from an all-male college, and made arrangements for Dart to officially receive her degree from all-female [[Vassar College]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://200.colgate.edu/looking-back/people/mabel-dart-colegrove-first-full-time-female-student|title=Mabel Dart Colegrove: First full-time female student|date=2019-01-01|publisher=Colgate University|accessdate=2019-04-24}}</ref>

In ensuing years, additional female students participated in courses, including faculty spouses and the wives of enrolled veterans in the post-WWII era.<ref name="auto"/> Colgate became fully coeducational in 1970.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/01/21/archives/colgate-to-go-coed-in-the-fall-of-1970.html|title=COLGATE TO GO COED IN THE FALL OF 1970|date=1969-01-21|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref>

=== President Cutten's controversial legacies ===
The [[National monument (United States)|national monument]] at [[Ellis Island]] displays a statement by Colgate's eighth President, [[George Barton Cutten]], which has been criticized for its jingoistic [[anti-immigrant|anti-immigration]] sentiment. He warned, "The danger [that] the '[[melting pot]]' brings to the nation is the breeding out of the higher divisions of the white race."<ref>{{cite journal| author = Ellen Percy Kraly| title = U.S. Immigration and the Environment: Scientific Research and Analytic Issues| publisher = U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform| year = 1995| url = http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/uscir/respapers/usi-feb95.pdf| accessdate = 2007-09-01| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927154626/http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/uscir/respapers/usi-feb95.pdf| archive-date = 2007-09-27}}</ref>

While Cutten's legacy has been marred by the espousal of [[racist]] beliefs, the contributions he made to developing the prestige and facilities of Colgate were significant. Student protests in 2006 around campus facilities bearing Cutter's name<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thecolgatemaroonnews.com/news/article_7c692240-0f41-5fc7-8a26-a3ee59767b34.html|title=A Closer Look at Cutten|last=Chopp|first=Rebecca|date=2006-03-03|publisher=The Colgate Maroon-News|accessdate=2006-03-03}}</ref> became emblematic of the division surrounding how modern American universities should broker their own history with racism,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Newkirk|first1=Pamela|title=Academe Must Confront Its Racist Past|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Academe-Must-Confront-Its/234534|newspaper=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=12 April 2017}}</ref> foreshadowing future controversies in the mid-2010s at universities such as [[Yale University]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Monica|last2=Svrluga|first2=Susan|title=Yale renames Calhoun College because of historical ties to white supremacy and slavery|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/02/11/yale-renames-calhoun-college-because-of-historic-ties-to-white-supremacy-and-slavery/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=9 April 2017}}</ref> and [[Harvard University]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lartey|first1=Jamiles|title=Racism at Harvard: months after protests began, students demand concrete change|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/13/racism-harvard-law-school-slaveholder-seal|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 April 2017}}</ref> Colgate removed the Cutten name from a residential complex located between Whitnall Field and Huntington Gym in 2017.

The campus itself is situated on {{convert|575|acre|km2}} of land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/about/colgate-campus|title=Colgate Campus|date=September 2014|publisher=Colgate University|accessdate=2014-09-09}}</ref> The university owns an additional {{convert|1100|acre|km2}} of undeveloped forested lands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/distinctly-colgate/sustainability/sustainability-council|title=Sustainability Council|publisher=Colgate University|accessdate=2014-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002113/http://www.colgate.edu/distinctly-colgate/sustainability/sustainability-council|archive-date=2014-09-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Colgate's first building, West Hall, was built by students and faculty from stones from Colgate's own rock quarry. Nearly all the buildings on campus are built of stone, and newer buildings are built with materials that fit the style.<ref name="stoneworld">{{cite news|url=http://www.stoneworld.com/CDA/Articles/Feature_Article/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000618570|title=Colgate University Continues Tradition of Stone |last=Fisher|first=Alexis|date=2009-07-01|publisher=Stone World|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> [[Old Biology Hall]] was built in 1884 and added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> The principal campus plan was created by Ernest W.

Probably the most distinctive building on campus is Colgate Memorial Chapel, which was built in 1918 and is used for lectures, performances, concerts, and religious services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/extPopUp6.aspx?pgID=1700&bID=24|title=Colgate Memorial Chapel|publisher=Colgate University|accessdate=2009-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610122820/http://www.colgate.edu/extpopup6.aspx?pgID=1700&bID=24|archive-date=2010-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Outreach ===
Colgate founded the Upstate Institute in 2003. The Institute was created to connect the Colgate community to its surrounding region, as well as to give back and help economically and socially sustain the area. Currently, they do research on counties in the area, as well as support outreach and volunteer organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upstate.colgate.edu/ui-about.html |title=About Upstate |publisher=Upstate Institute |accessdate=2009-07-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130050247/http://upstate.colgate.edu/ui-about.html |archive-date=January 30, 2009 }}</ref>

Colgate was an initial sponsor of Partnership for Community Development,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/DesktopDefault1.aspx?tabid=512|title=About Colgate: The Hamilton Area|publisher=Colgate University|accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref> a local nonprofit organization which seeks to support the community through revitalization of buildings and small business development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.partnersatwork.org/html/partners.html|title=History of the Partnership|publisher=Partnership for Community Development|accessdate=2009-07-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723231556/http://www.partnersatwork.org/html/partners.html|archive-date=2008-07-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Longyear Museum of Anthropology===
The Longyear Museum of Anthropology is part of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Colgate University. Carol Ann Lorenz is the Senior Curator and Jordan Kerber is the Curator of Archaeological Collections.

The Longyear Museum exhibition gallery is centrally located in Alumni Hall on campus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Longyear Museum of Anthropology|url=http://www.colgate.edu/campus-life/arts-on-campus/longyear-museum-of-anthropology|publisher=Colgate University|accessdate=31 January 2016}}</ref> The museum has approximately 20,000 archaeological artifacts from North, Central, and South America as well as artworks from Africa, Native North America, Asia, and Oceania. Prior to the construction of the gallery, objects were exhibited in display cases in the department of Social Relations.

Professor of anthropology and archaeologist John M. Longyear III, who retired from Colgate University in 1978, suggested a Museum where students could study and interact with the collection.

Today, the Museum hosts about four exhibitions per academic year, some of which are partly curated by students. Academic classes also work in conjunction with the Longyear. As a group, students in these classes research and curate exhibitions from the Museum's collection, or create virtual exhibitions. During the summer months, students can apply for research grants to work directly with the permanent collection. In some cases, student work will result in an exhibition featuring the researched objects. Access to the collection is available to students who enroll in an independent study class and receive course credit for working with the museum.

===Picker Art Gallery===

The Picker Art Gallery is the fine arts museum that is housed in the Dana Arts Center at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York. It was named after Evelyn Picker, class of '36 and trustee emeritus, and opened in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/campus-life/arts-on-campus/picker-art-gallery|title=Picker Art Gallery|work=colgate.edu}}</ref> The Museum houses an impressive 11,000-some art objects in its permanent collections. Highlights include old master paintings from Europe, woodblock prints from China and Japan, and a series of original photographs from famed Soviet wartime photographer [[Yevgeny Khaldei]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/campus-life/arts-on-campus/picker-art-gallery/collections|title=Collections - Picker Art Gallery}}</ref> The Picker has also hosted exhibitions from artists across the world and collections from other museums in the US.

Currently, there are plans to move the Picker collection to a new facility, which Colgate University has named the Center for Art and Culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.colgate.edu/2013/07/architect-david-adjaye-presents-design-for-center-for-art-and-culture.html|title=Architect David Adjaye presents design for Center for Art and Culture|work=Colgate University News}}</ref> This center, which was designed and centered with the community at large in mind, includes plans for “exhibition space, seminar rooms, project space, and archive space,” along with office space, reception area, amnemities, and a space for public functions. The same building plans to house Longyear Museum of Anthropology.

====Exhibitions====
The Picker Art Museum recently launched an online campaign to display works as a digital exhibition, their first being “Selected Old Masters From the Picker Art Gallery.”<ref name="pickeroldmasters.omeka.net">{{cite web|url=http://pickeroldmasters.omeka.net|title=Selected Old Masters from the Picker Art Gallery|work=omeka.net|access-date=2014-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413235824/http://pickeroldmasters.omeka.net/|archive-date=2014-04-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other than this online gallery, all exhibition and educational programs have been temporarily ceased due to the university's thorough assessment of the works in anticipation for the move to the new Center for Arts and Culture.

== Academics ==
[[File:Lathrop Hall classroom at Colgate University.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A classroom in Colgate University's Lathrop Hall]]

Colgate offers 56 undergraduate [[academic major|major]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/academics/majors-and-minors|title=Majors & Minors|publisher=Colgate University |accessdate=2017-03-22}}</ref> leading to a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, all of which are registered officially with the [[New York State Education Department|New York State Department of Education]].

Approximately two-thirds of Colgate undergraduates study abroad, which is a high proportion compared to other colleges and universities in the United States. About 95% of seniors graduate and most alumni proceed to graduate schools in law, administration, engineering, medicine, the arts and the sciences, as well as to financial, administrative or scientific occupations. In partnership similar to that of [[Haverford College|Haverford]] and [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]], Colgate students are also able to enroll in classes at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], another nearby selective liberal arts school.

=== Fraternities and sororities ===
Since the first chartered chapter in 1856, [[fraternities and sororities]] have been part of a long-standing tradition at Colgate University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/campus-life/fraternities-and-sororities|title=Fraternities and Sororities - Fraternity and Sorority Affairs - Greek|work=colgate.edu}}</ref>

Following a number of incidents related to fraternities and sororities on campus, in 2005, the university decided to purchase the Greek houses.<ref name="usatoday-greek">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2005-04-11-colgate-greeks_x.htm|title=Colgate University buying Greek houses|date=2005-04-11|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=2009-08-20}}</ref> All but one of them agreed to sell their houses.

Delta Kappa Epsilon no longer has affiliation with the school.

=== Student groups ===
Colgate has close to 200 student groups and organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/campus-life/clubs-and-organizations |title=Student Organizations|publisher=Colgate University |accessdate=2014-09-09}}</ref> The groups cover a wide array of interests, including academic organizations, personal interests, student government, honor societies, and cultural and religious organizations.

=== Media ===
WRCU is Colgate University's student-operated radio station, broadcasting throughout central New York on 90.1 FM, and the station was re-modeled in 2010. Colgate's student run TV station, CUTV, broadcasts on the university's local cable system and provides a mix of student-created content and first-run movies 24 hours a day. ''The [[Colgate Maroon-News]]'', is the oldest college weekly in America. The first student newspaper was the ''Hamilton Student'',<ref name="Hamilton Student">{{cite web|url=http://exlibris.colgate.edu/digital/HamiltonStudent.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124150117/http://exlibris.colgate.edu/digital/HamiltonStudent.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-01-24|title=Hamilton Student}}</ref> launched on November 2, 1846. ''The Monthly Rag'', the college's satirical newspaper, was founded in 2007. Its slogan is, "written by 13 writers with 13 stories after 13 beers". The Colgate Scene is the quarterly alumni publication.

The number 13 is considered to be lucky at Colgate.<ref name="history-traditions" /> It is said that Colgate was founded by thirteen men with thirteen dollars, thirteen prayers and thirteen articles. This tradition is expressed in many ways. Colgate's address is 13 Oak Drive, and its zip code is 13346, which begins with 13 and ends with three digits that sum to 13.<ref name="colgate-colors">{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/DesktopDefault1.aspx?tabid=730&pgID=6013&nwID=3750|title=Have no fear: Show your Colgate colors on Friday the 13th |last=Jenkins|first=Caroline |date=2005-05-11|publisher=Colgate University|accessdate=2009-08-20}}</ref> Konosioni, a senior honor society, is composed of thirteen men and thirteen women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://colgate.collegiatelink.net/organization/konosioni|title=Konosioni|publisher=Colgate University|accessdate=2014-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002032/https://colgate.collegiatelink.net/organization/konosioni|archive-date=2014-09-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> Alumni wear Colgate apparel on every Friday the 13th, which is designated as Colgate Day.<ref name="colgate-colors" />

In 1936, the Colgate swim team made its first trip to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] for spring break training at the Casino Pool.  This became a regular tradition for Colgate that caught on with other schools across the country, and proved to be the genesis of the college [[spring break]] trip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.edu/DesktopDefault1.aspx?tabid=730&pgID=6013&nwID=4785|title='Washington Post' turns to Colgate for comment about SATs|accessdate=2007-09-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814080912/http://www.colgate.edu/DesktopDefault1.aspx?tabid=730&pgID=6013&nwID=4785|archive-date=2007-08-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[college football|football]] program competes within the Division I [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS). The athletic teams are nicknamed the "Raiders," and the traditional team colors are [[maroon (color)|maroon]] and white, with a more recent addition of gray in the 1970s.

Starting in 1932, Colgate athletics teams were called the "Red Raiders" in reference to the new maroon uniforms of that season's [[1932 Colgate Red Raiders football team|"undefeated, untied, unscored upon, and uninvited" football team]], which was the first to use the moniker.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,769729-2,00.html|title=Sport: Football, Oct. 31, 1932|date=1932-10-31|magazine=Time|accessdate=2009-08-20}}</ref> Apocryphal explanations for the name include the team's ability to defeat its much larger rival, the [[Cornell University]] [[Cornell Big Red|Big Red]], or that a rainstorm caused one Colgate football team's maroon jerseys to blend into a reddish color.<ref name=danielson/> Regardless, after the adoption of a [[Native American mascot controversy|Native American mascot]], the school debated changing the name and mascot in the 1970s out of sensitivity to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].
