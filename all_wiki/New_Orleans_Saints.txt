The Saints were among the NFL's least successful franchises in their first several decades, where they went 20 consecutive seasons without a winning record or qualifying for the playoffs. They earned their first winning record and postseason berth in [[1987 New Orleans Saints season|1987]], while their first playoff win would not occur until [[2000 New Orleans Saints season|2000]], their 34th season. The team's fortunes improved amid the 21st century, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders. Their greatest success was during the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009 season]] when they won the franchise's first [[Super Bowl]] title in [[Super Bowl XLIV]], also their championship debut. The Saints are one of three NFL franchises to win their sole Super Bowl appearance, along with the [[New York Jets]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], and the most recent to do so.

{{main|History of the New Orleans Saints}}

===Early history===
First the brainchild of local sports entrepreneur [[David Dixon (businessman)|Dave Dixon]], who later built the [[Louisiana Superdome]] and founded the [[USFL]], the Saints were actually secretly born in a backroom deal brought about by U.S. Congressman [[Hale Boggs]], U.S. Senator [[Russell Long]], and NFL Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]]. The NFL needed congressional approval of the proposed [[AFL–NFL merger]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Sandomir |first=Richard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/sports/football/27sandomir.html?ref=sports |title=Congress's Team: Deal for Merger Included Saints |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 27, 2010 |accessdate=February 7, 2010}}</ref> Dixon and a local civic group had been seeking an NFL franchise for over five years and had hosted record crowds for NFL exhibition games. To seal the merger, Rozelle arrived in New Orleans within a week, and announced on November 1, 1966, that the NFL officially had awarded the city of New Orleans an NFL franchise.<ref name=sdcwbglp/><ref name=milwsntlf/> The team was named for "[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]", the classic jazz standard associated with New Orleans. When the deal was reached a week earlier, Dixon strongly suggested to Rozelle that the announcement be delayed until November 1st, to coincide with [[All Saints' Day]]. Dixon even cleared the name with New Orleans' Archbishop [[Philip Hannan|Philip M. Hannan]], "thought it would be a good idea," according to Dixon. "He had an idea the team was going to need all the help it could get."<ref>{{cite web|last=Mule |first=Marty |url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2010/08/dave_dixon_driving_force_behin.html |title=Dave Dixon, driving force behind Superdome, dies |work=[[Times-Picayune]] |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate= September 22, 2010}}</ref>

Boggs' Congressional committee in turn quickly approved the NFL merger. [[John W. Mecom Jr.]], a young oilman from Houston, became the team's first majority stockholder. The team's colors, black and gold, symbolized both Mecom's and New Orleans' strong ties to the [[oil]] industry. Trumpeter [[Al Hirt]] was part owner of the team, and his rendition of "When the Saints Go Marching In" was made the official fight song.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 25 - Archie Manning (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Archie Manning]], pictured attempting a pass in 1980, was one of the first players to be inducted into the Saints' Ring of Honor.]]
The inaugural game in [[1967 New Orleans Saints season|1967]] on September 17 started with a 94-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown by [[John Gilliam]], but the [[1967 New Orleans Saints season|Saints]] lost that game 27–13 to the [[1967 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] at Tulane Stadium, with over 80,000 in attendance.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ctcpAAAAIBAJ&pg=6825%2C3573816 |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Rams get scare but top Saints |date=September 18, 1967 |page=2, part 2}}</ref> It was one of the few highlights of a 3–11 season, which set an NFL record for most wins by an expansion team.

For most of their first 20 years, the Saints were the definition of NFL futility, finishing third or fourth in their division until [[1979 New Orleans Saints season|1979]]. The 1979 and [[1983 New Orleans Saints season|1983]] teams were the only ones to even finish at .500 until 1987.

One of the franchise's early bright moments came on November 8, 1970, when [[Tom Dempsey]] kicked an NFL record-breaking 63-yard field goal at Tulane Stadium to defeat the [[1970 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] 19–17 in the final seconds of the game; the previous record was seven yards less, set in <!--September 27,-->{{nfly|1953}}.<ref name=dfgwgmms>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IJtRAAAAIBAJ&pg=3930%2C1540387 |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Dempsey's 63 yard FG jolts Lions |date=November 9, 1970 |page=1, part 2}}</ref><ref name=cjbrs>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=E5ExAAAAIBAJ&pg=2279%2C3321799 |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Colts jolt Bears, 13-9, get record 56-yard field goal|date=September 28, 1953 |page=2, part 2}}</ref> Dempsey's record was not broken until {{nfly|2013}} by [[Matt Prater]] of the [[2013 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], who kicked one yard farther (at elevation in Colorado).

In [[1980 New Orleans Saints season|1980]], the Saints lost their first 14 games, prompting local sportscaster Bernard "Buddy D" Diliberto to advise Saints supporters to wear paper bags over their heads at the team's home games; many bags rendered the club's name as the "'[[Ain't|Aint]]s" rather than the "Saints."<ref name=Aints>{{cite news|last1=Bishop|first1=Greg|title=Beneath Brown Bags, Saints Had Loyal Fans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/sports/football/05bag.html?_r=0|accessdate=May 25, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=February 4, 2010}}</ref>

===Jim E. Mora era (1986–1996)===
[[Tom Benson]], a successful automobile dealership owner and banker, acquired the franchise in 1985, and hired [[Jim Finks]] as general manager and [[Jim E. Mora|Jim Mora]] as head coach. That combination provided the Saints with their first-ever winning record and playoff appearance, going [[1987 New Orleans Saints season|12–3]] in [[1987 NFL season|1987]], which had one fewer game than normal due to a [[1987 NFL strike|players' strike]]. Another playoff berth would follow during the [[1990 NFL season|1990 season]], and the club's first division title came in [[1991 NFL season|1991]]. During Mora's tenure, the Saints made the playoffs four times, with teams marked by strong defenses led by the "[[Dome Patrol]]" linebacking corps, but they were never able to win a playoff game. Mora coached the Saints until the middle of the [[1996 NFL season|1996 season]], when he stepped down halfway through the [[1996 New Orleans Saints season|3–13 season]]. His 93 wins were three more than the Saints won in their entire history prior to his arrival, and would remain the most for any Saints coach until 2016.

===Mike Ditka era (1997–1999)===
After the end of the 1996 season, ironically as Diliberto had suggested before Mora's resignation, former [[Chicago Bears]] coach [[Mike Ditka]] was hired to replace Mora. Although this initially generated a lot of excitement among Saints fans, Ditka's tenure ended up being a failure. The Saints went 6–10 in their first two seasons under Ditka ([[1997 NFL season|1997]] and [[1998 NFL season|1998]]). During the [[1999 NFL Draft]], Ditka traded all of his picks for that season, as well as the first-round and third-round picks for the following season, to the [[Washington Redskins]] in order to draft [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]] [[Heisman Trophy]] running back [[Ricky Williams]] in the first round. Ditka and Williams had a mock wedding picture taken to commemorate the occasion. However, Ditka, most of his coaching staff, and general manager [[Bill Kuharich]] were fired at the end of the [[1999 NFL season|1999 season]] due to the club's [[1999 New Orleans Saints season|3–13 record]].

===Jim Haslett era (2000–2005)===
[[Jim Haslett]] held the post from 2000 to 2005. In his first year, he took the team to the 2000 [[1999–2000 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[2000 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] for the team's first ever playoff win. The team lost the following week to the [[2000 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]. After winning the 2000 NFL Executive of the Year Award, General Manager [[Randy Mueller]] was fired between the 2001 and 2002 seasons without explanation by Benson. The Saints failed to make the playoffs in 2001 and 2002, although in the latter year they had the distinction of beating the eventual [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] champion [[2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in both of their regular season meetings, only the second team to do so in NFL history.

In [[2003 NFL season|2003]], the Saints again missed the [[2003–04 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] after finishing 8–8. The [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]] started poorly for the [[2004 New Orleans Saints season|Saints]], as they went 2–4 through their first six games and 4–8 through their first twelve games. At that point Haslett's job appeared to be in jeopardy; however, he managed to win the three straight games leading up to the season finale, leaving the Saints in playoff contention in the final week of the season. In week 17, the Saints defeated division rivals [[2004 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina]]; however, the Saints needed other results to break their way and when the [[2004 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] beat the [[2004 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] the Saints were eliminated despite having beaten the Rams, who finished with the same record. The Rams, Saints, and [[2004 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] all were 8–8, with the Rams having a 7–5 conference record, Saints 6–6, and the Vikings 5–7. The Rams received the #1 wild-card due to having the best conference record out of the three, followed by the Vikings due to the 38–31 loss handed to the Saints in Week 6. Haslett was fired after the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], in which the [[2005 New Orleans Saints season|Saints]] finished 3–13 and did not play any regular season games in New Orleans due to [[Hurricane Katrina]].

====Effect of Hurricane Katrina====
{{main|Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Saints}}
[[File:New Orleans Saints at Tiger Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Tiger Stadium was one of the venues that hosted the Saints in 2005.]]
Due to the damage [[Hurricane Katrina]] caused to the Superdome and the New Orleans area, the Saints' scheduled [[2005 NFL season|2005]] home opener against the [[2005 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] was moved to [[Giants Stadium]]. The remainder of their 2005 home games were split between the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]], and [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]'s [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].

===Sean Payton era (2006–present)===
[[File:Sean Payton 07feb10.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sean Payton is the current head coach.]]

'''2006 season'''
{{Main|2006 New Orleans Saints season}}
On January 17, 2006, the Saints hired [[Sean Payton]] as their new head coach and, on March 14, signed former [[San Diego Chargers]] quarterback [[Drew Brees]] to a six-year, $60 million deal.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clayton |first1=John |title=Brees agrees to six-year deal with Saints |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2368304 |website=ESPN.com |accessdate=September 18, 2018 |date=March 14, 2006}}</ref>

On March 23, the Saints announced that the team's two 2006 preseason games were to be played at [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], and [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. After a $185 million renovation of the historic stadium, on April 6 the Saints released their 2006 schedule, with all home games scheduled to be played at the Superdome. On September 19, Saints owner [[Tom Benson]] announced that the team had sold out the [[Louisiana Superdome]] for the entire season with season tickets alone (68,354 seats), a first in franchise history.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/23/AR2006092301102.html|title=The Saints Bring Hope to the Faithful|last=Carpenter|first=Les|date=September 24, 2006|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=February 24, 2017|work=|language=en-US|issn=|via=}}</ref>

The September 25, home opener, the first home game in [[New Orleans]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]], was won by the Saints 23–3 against the [[2006 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], who were undefeated in the 2006 season at that time. The attendance for the game was a sellout crowd of 70,003. Meanwhile, the broadcast of the game was [[ESPN]]'s highest-ever rated program to date, with an 11.8 rating, and viewership by 10.85 million homes. It was the most-watched program for the night, broadcast or cable, and was the second-highest rated cable program of all time at the time. [[Green Day]] and [[U2]] performed "[[Wake Me Up When September Ends]]" and "[[The Saints Are Coming]]", respectively, before the game. The game received a 2007 [[ESPY]] award for "[[Best Moment ESPY Award|Best Moment in Sports]]." The game is remembered by Saints fans for [[Steve Gleason]]'s blocked punt on the opening series that resulted in a touchdown for New Orleans.

On December 17, the Saints clinched their third division title and their first [[NFC South]] title in franchise history. For the first time in Saints' history, they clinched their [[NFC South]] title on their home field. [[Sean Payton]] became the second consecutive Saints coach to win a division title in his first season. After the [[2006 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] beat the [[2006 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 23–7 on Christmas Day 2006, the Saints clinched a first-round playoff bye for the first time in franchise history, finishing the regular season with a record of 10-6.

After the first-round bye, the Saints beat the [[2006 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] 27–24 in the Superdome in the 2006 Divisional Playoffs. No team had ever had such a poor record in the prior year (3–13) and then gone on to a league or conference championship game since the [[1999 St. Louis Rams season|1999 St. Louis Rams]] who advanced to win their first [[Super Bowl XXXIV|Super Bowl]] after being 4–12 the season before. Since the Saints' only previous playoff win was in the wild card round, this was the farthest the Saints had ever advanced at the time. The victory was only the second playoff win in team history. The season ended on January 21, 2007, when the Saints lost 39–14 to the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] in the [[NFC Championship Game|NFC Championship game]].

'''2007 season'''
{{Main|2007 New Orleans Saints season}}
The Saints announced that for the second year in a row, the [[Louisiana Superdome]] had sold out every ticket for the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saintsdoggle.blogspot.com/2007/03/t-p-saints-sell-out-suites-for-2007.html |title=saintsdoggle: UPDATE: Saints sell out suites for 2007 season; Season ticket wait list 25,000 deep; San Antonio finally giving up? |publisher=Saintsdoggle.blogspot.com |date=March 15, 2007 |accessdate=February 7, 2010}}</ref> Additionally, all luxury boxes had been sold out for the season.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Both of these statistics are particularly surprising given that the city-proper has about 300,000 people or 150,000 fewer people than July 2005 population data (though the metro area still accounts for 1.2 million people).{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The first game of the season was against the defending [[Super Bowl XLI]] champion [[2007 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]]. The Saints lost this game, 41–10, and lost their next three games. In one of these three games, against the [[2007 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]], the Saints lost running back [[Deuce McAllister]] for the season with his second career (second time in three seasons) [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] tear. After winning their first game, against the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], two weeks later, the team went on a four-game winning streak to bring their record to an even 4–4. After reaching 7–7, the Saints lost their final two games to finish 7–9.

'''2008 season'''
{{Main|2008 New Orleans Saints season}}
Following a disappointing 7–9 record in the 2007 season, the Saints ended the 2008 season 8–8. Failing to qualify for the post season for the second straight year, the Saints found themselves struggling on defense. However, the Saints would match the explosive offense they had in the 2006 season. Drew Brees ended the 2008 season just 16 yards short of beating [[Dan Marino]]'s single-season record of 5084 total passing yards, and receiver [[Lance Moore]] came 72 yards short of his first 1000-yard season.

'''2009 season: First Super Bowl championship'''
{{Main|2009 New Orleans Saints season}}
[[File:Brees london 2008.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Quarterback [[Drew Brees]] was named MVP in [[Super Bowl XLIV]].]]
The 2009 season was the team's most successful season, which culminated in the franchise's first league championship win against the [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] in [[Super Bowl XLIV]]. After achieving a record of 13–0 with their win over the [[2009 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], it marked the Saints' best start to a season in its franchise history. The result clinched an NFC [[2009–10 NFL playoffs|playoff]] berth, a bye in the first round of the playoffs. By winning their first 13 games, the Saints also set the record for the longest undefeated season opening (13–0) by an NFC team since the [[AFL–NFL merger]], surpassing the previous record (12–0) held by the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]]. However, they would fall victim to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in week 14, going on to end the season with a three-game losing streak. The Saints became the first team to win a Super Bowl after losing its last three regular season games.

Although its opponents would include winners of 9 of the last 15 NFL MVP awards, the team advanced to the 2009 NFC Championship game where they defeated the Minnesota Vikings, led by [[Brett Favre]], 31–28 in overtime, advancing to their first [[Super Bowl]] appearance in franchise history. Television ratings for Super Bowl XLIV (44) were the highest for any TV program, sports or otherwise, in history,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2011/super-bowl-xlv-most-viewed-telecast-in-broadcast-history.html |title=Most Viewed Telecast |publisher=Nielson |date=February 7, 2011 |accessdate=2013-08-08}}</ref> as their successful bid to win the Super Bowl was seen by many to represent the city's resurgence after the devastating Hurricane Katrina.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

'''2010 season'''
{{Main|2010 New Orleans Saints season}}
The Saints 2010 season began in the Superdome as the defending Super Bowl champions defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 14–9, in a rematch of the 2009 NFC Championship Game. It was played on Thursday September 9, 2010 and televised on NBC, making it the first time the Saints have opened the NFL's season at home. On Sunday, August 8, 2010, NBC announced the televised opening festivities of the evening would begin with [[Taylor Swift]] and [[Dave Matthews Band]]. On December 27, 2010, with a 17–14 win against the Atlanta Falcons in Atlanta, the Saints clinched a playoff appearance (wild card). This marked the first time a team in the NFC South had made back-to-back playoff appearances since the division was formed in 2002. The Saints would face the Seattle Seahawks for the wild-card opener at Qwest Field. The Seahawks were the first NFL team to capture their division with a sub-.500 regular season record (7–9). Drew Brees completed a postseason-record 39 passes for 404 yards and two touchdowns. Despite throwing 60 passes and hindered by a lack of depth at running back, last year's Super Bowl MVP was not intercepted and rallied the Saints within 34–30 in the fourth quarter. In the end, his efforts were negated by a defense that could not get enough stops and a late touchdown run by [[Marshawn Lynch]] breaking over a half-dozen tackles with 3:22 left which helped the Seahawks defeat the Saints 41–36.

'''2011 season'''
{{Main|2011 New Orleans Saints season}}
The Saints began their season with a loss against the [[Green Bay Packers]], but the team rebounded for the next four weeks to bring their record to 4–1. A loss to the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] brought the record to 4–2, but the team bounced back with a 62–7 blowout win against the struggling [[Indianapolis Colts]]. A surprise loss to the [[St. Louis Rams]] resulted in the record dropping to 5–3. In the next seven weeks the Saints beat talented teams such as the eventual [[Super Bowl XLVI]] champion [[New York Giants]], [[Detroit Lions]], and [[Atlanta Falcons]], bringing their season record to 12–3. To cap off the season, quarterback [[Drew Brees]] broke the single season passing record held for over 25 years, on the way to a Saints division winning game. The Saints won the [[NFC South]] title on December 26 and ended the 2011 season as the third seed in the NFC. They finished with a 13–3 record, beating Carolina 45–17 and also giving running back Darren Sproles the record for most all-purpose yards in a single season. The team broke numerous records that year including most yards in a season, completion percentage, yards passing, completions and more. The New Orleans Saints beat the Detroit Lions in the 2011 NFC wild-card playoff game 45–28. New Orleans also tied the NFL's postseason mark for team first downs in a game (34), and broke the record for total yards with 626, eclipsing the yardage record set 49 years ago. The Saints lost in the Divisional round in the playoffs against the San Francisco 49ers in Candlestick Park, a game considered an instant classic by many {{cn|reason=by whom?|date=December 2020}} due to the numerous lead changes in the final four minutes of play.

'''2012 season: Payton suspended; punishment for Bountygate'''
{{Main|2012 New Orleans Saints season}}
After an off-season dominated by the [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal|bounty scandal]] and the year-long suspension of head coach [[Sean Payton]], the Saints sought to refocus on football and produce yet another winning year. Instead, the team, led by offensive line coach [[Aaron Kromer]] for its first six games, started the season with four straight losses and a last place spot in the NFC South. The team finally broke through with a win in Week 5, against the San Diego Chargers, a game that also saw quarterback Drew Brees break Johnny Unitas's longstanding record for consecutive games with a touchdown pass. After their bye week, the Saints went on to win 4 of their next 5 games, to bring their record to an even 5–5. [[Joe Vitt]] returned after his six-game suspension to serve as interim head coach for the rest of the season. The team failed to hold its momentum, however, and lost the next three games, including a loss at Atlanta that also marked the end of Brees' record touchdown streak after 54 games, and a 52–27 blowout loss to the Giants that dropped the Saints to 5–8. Despite winning 2 of their last 3 games, and Brees again leading the league with 5,177 passing yards (his third time to surpass 5,000 yards, as he remained the only quarterback to break that barrier more than once), the team finished third in the NFC South, at 7–9. The Saints defense allowed 7,042 yards, setting an NFL record.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nfl.si.com/2012/12/30/saints-defense-sets-record-for-most-yards-allowed-in-a-season/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314033706/http://nfl.si.com/2012/12/30/saints-defense-sets-record-for-most-yards-allowed-in-a-season/ |archivedate=March 14, 2014}}</ref>

'''2013 season'''
{{Main|2013 New Orleans Saints season}}
The Saints finished their 2013 preseason 3–1, and won their first five regular season games against the Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, [[Arizona Cardinals]], Miami Dolphins and Chicago Bears. The Saints under Sean Peyton had been winless in Chicago's Soldier Field and had not won in the Windy City since 2000. The Saints fared well against Chicago, Arizona and Miami, winning 26–18, 31–7 and 38–17 respectively, but needed a 4th down shutdown and a last-minute field goal to escape Atlanta and Tampa Bay. The Saints went on a 5–0 win streak, but were stopped short by the New England Patriots in Week 6, losing 30–27, with a touchdown pass by Tom Brady in the last 5 seconds of the game. New Orleans would go undefeated at home for the second straight season with Sean Payton as the head coach, but finish just 3–5 on the road. Key losses included a 7–34 blowout against the [[Seattle Seahawks]] on [[Monday Night Football]] in Seattle which cost them homefield advantage throughout the playoffs, a 16–27 upset against the [[St. Louis Rams]] in St. Louis which led to the Saints needing to win their next game against Carolina to control their own playoff destiny, and a heartbreaking 13–17 defeat to their division rival the [[Carolina Panthers]] in Charlotte who went on to win the NFC South. The Saints finished the season with an 11–5 record and earned a wild card berth as the sixth seed in the NFC. On January 4, 2014, the Saints recorded their first road playoff win in franchise history over the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] 26–24. On January 11, the Saints lost to the first seed, the Seattle Seahawks, once again in Seattle 15–23. The weather conditions were very poor, which gave the offense much difficulty. Despite the conditions, the defense of the Saints played well, holding Seattle to just 23 over the 34 points allowed against Seattle during the regular season.

'''2014 season'''
{{Main|2014 New Orleans Saints season}}
The Saints finished the season 7–9, second in their division behind the 7–8–1 Carolina Panthers. They missed out on the playoffs after being defeated 14–30 by their divisional rival, the Atlanta Falcons, in the second-to-last week of the season. This season was notorious in Saints history for having the 31st worst ranked defense in the league, which is one of the main reasons for the Saints poor 2014 campaign. The only two great performances by the defense out of the entire season came from a 44–23 home win against the [[Green Bay Packers]] and a 31–15 victory against the [[Chicago Bears]] in Chicago.

'''2015 season'''
{{Main|2015 New Orleans Saints season}}
The Saints finished with a 7–9 record for the second consecutive season. They were third in the [[NFC South]] after the 15–1 NFC champions [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] and the 8–8 [[2015 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]. Their defense was historically bad. They allowed the most passing touchdowns in a season in [[National Football League|NFL]] history as they allowed 45, effectively making them the worst passing defense in NFL history. They also set the NFL record in opposing passer rating (116.2), while finishing last in points allowed (29.8) and yards allowed per play (6.6).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://theadvocate.com/sports/latestsports/14630245-37/saints-defense-held-itself-back-in-2015-by-obliterating-team-record-for-first-downs-allowed-by-penal | title=Saints defense held itself back in 2015 | publisher=theadvocate.com | date=January 20, 2016 | accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref> Atrocious play by defensive captain Brandon Browner, who set the NFL record for most penalties with 23, did not help the struggling Saints defense.

He had two scores, both coming against the Carolina Panthers and led all rookies in tackles. Second-round pick [[Hau'oli Kikaha]] had 4 sacks. Canadian football star [[Delvin Breaux]], who was signed in the off-season, led the Saints struggling secondary with 3 interceptions and 19 pass deflections. [[Drew Brees]] also tied the NFL record for touchdown passes in a game with 7, coming against the [[New York Giants]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Orr|first1=Connor|title=Drew Brees ties single-game record with 7 TD passes|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000570255/article/drew-brees-ties-singlegame-record-with-7-td-passes|website=[[NFL.com]]|accessdate=February 11, 2016|date=November 1, 2015}}</ref>

==Logos and uniforms==
[[File:New Orleans Saints alternate (c. 2000).png|thumb|right|165px|The fleur-de-lis is the symbol of the Saints.]]
Black, along with [[old gold]] and white, has always been one of the team colors, but it was not the first choice of original majority owner John W. Mecom Jr. His preference was for Mecom blue, a medium shade which was used by all of his other investments. The NFL office, however, informed him that his proposed combination too closely resembled that worn by the [[San Diego Chargers]]. Although the Chargers were members of the AFL, the older league did not want to offend its soon-to-be partner so soon after the merger. Mecom settled on black as the primary color as a nod to his financial involvement in the [[petroleum industry]]. "Black gold" is a term [[synonym]]ous with [[petroleum|oil]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Langenhennig|first1=Susan|title=Power colors: Black and gold are tops on the red carpet – and this season – on synthetic turf|url=http://www.nola.com/fashion/index.ssf/2009/11/power_colors_black_and_gold_sa.html|website=[[The Times-Picayune]]|accessdate=February 11, 2016|date=November 30, 2009}}</ref> Although the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]—who played a few home games in New Orleans during their early years to avoid conflict with the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football]] team—have long used black and gold as their colors, their shade of gold more closely resembles yellow, making the Saints black and gold compatible with the rest of the NFL.

Except for minor modifications, the Saints' logo and uniforms have basically remained the same since the club debuted in 1967. The team's logo is a [[fleur-de-lis]] (a symbol of the City of New Orleans and of France's [[List of French monarchs|Royal Family]], which included the [[House of Bourbon]]), while its uniform design consists of gold helmets, gold pants, and either black or white jerseys. Minor changes to the uniform stripes and trim have been made throughout the years. The team wore black helmets during the 1969 preseason, but NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] barred the Saints from using the helmets during the regular season, since Mecom did not notify the league office of the change. Black helmets have never been introduced since, not even as an alternate helmet prior to 2013, when the NFL began to require teams to use only one helmet shell per season.

The Saints predominantly wore white at home when the club played at [[Tulane Stadium]] from 1967 through 1974 (except in 1969 and 1970), forcing opponents to suffer in their darker jerseys in the [[subtropical climate]] of New Orleans. When the surface at Tulane Stadium switched from natural grass to [[PolyTurf]] in 1971, field temperatures became hotter still. In [[Archie Manning]]'s first game, in the 1971 season opener against the [[1971 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]], temperatures on the field reached as high as {{convert|130|F|C}}. The heavily favored Rams wilted in the stifling heat, and the Saints claimed their first-ever victory over their NFC West rivals, 24–20, on Manning's one-yard quarterback sneak on the last play of the game.

The Saints switched to white pants in 1975, coinciding with the team's move from Tulane Stadium to the Superdome, and have worn white at home numerous times since then. One year later, they started to wear black pants with their white jerseys, a move influenced by coach Hank Stram, who introduced red pants to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]' uniforms in 1968. In an October 3, 1976 home game against the [[1976 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]], Hank Stram used the Saints' road uniforms, the white jerseys and black pants. The Saints lost that game 31–26. During the 1981–82 seasons ([[Bum Phillips]]' first two seasons as coach), the team wore white jerseys with black pants at home, but reverted to the black jerseys and white pants for 1983. They reverted to wearing gold pants with both their black and white jerseys in 1986 under new coach [[Jim E. Mora]]. From 1986 through 1995, the sleeves of the jerseys and sides of the pants featured a logo with a fleur-de-lis inside an outline of the state of [[Louisiana]] (with the location of New Orleans marked with a star in the state outline). The logo replaced the striping pattern that had been on the uniforms since the team's inception; save for color variations, the striping pattern was similar to that used by the [[Washington Redskins]] (until 1979), [[Green Bay Packers]] (until 1997), and [[Cleveland Browns]] (until 2014), which is likely why the change was made. That logo was removed in 1996 and replaced with a fleur-de-lis on both the sleeves and sides of the pants.

From 1996 through 1998, the Saints returned to gold numbers on both the white and black jerseys, but complaints about the numbers on the white jerseys being too difficult to read forced the numbers on the white jerseys to be changed to black in 1999. The Saints wore black pants with a wide gold stripe with their white jerseys in 1999, but following a 3–13 season and the dismissal of coach [[Mike Ditka]], the black pants were mothballed by new coach [[Jim Haslett]].

===2000s===
In [[2000 NFL season|2000]], the Saints won their first playoff game as they hosted the [[2000 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], and after having a better road record than home record, they wore their white jerseys, and won 31–28 over the defending champion Rams. The defining play of the game came with the Saints clinging to a three-point lead with minutes to play. The Saints punted to the Rams' [[Az-Zahir Hakim]] (who would play one season for the Saints in 2005), who fumbled the punt deep in Rams' territory. [[Brian Milne]] recovered for the Saints, who then ran out the clock to preserve the victory.

In [[2001 NFL season|2001]], they wore their white jerseys in the first six home games. During that same year, they primarily wore black pants with both their white and black jerseys. They became the first NFL team to wear all-black uniforms in a week 5 road game against the [[2001 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], and again in weeks 16 and 17 in home games against the [[2001 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] and [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]]; the Saints were outscored 78–10 in the final two contests to end a 7–9 campaign.

In [[2002 NFL season|2002]], the Saints wore black pants with their white jerseys (except for the final road game, a 20–13 loss in [[Paul Brown Stadium|Cincinnati]] when they went back to the gold pants), and gold pants with their black jerseys, a gold alternate jersey, and a 1967-style throwback uniform, complete with an accurate 1967-era helmet which featured a larger fleur-de-lis, a darker shade of gold and grey facemasks. But one season later, they stopped using the alternates and again reverted to wearing gold pants with both their black and white jerseys.

The team introduced a gold alternate jersey (worn with the black pants) during a December 15, 2002 game versus the [[Minnesota Vikings]], a 32–31 loss, but have never worn them since then. Because of the metallic gold's bright color, the gold jerseys were considered the "light" jersey in the game, so the Vikings wore their purple home jerseys as the "dark" colored team. One team must wear "dark" and one team must wear "light", this was done because of black & white t.v. broadcasts so viewers could tell the teams apart. The only exception being if both teams are wearing throwback uniforms, such as Thanksgiving Classic games. From 2003 through 2007, the [[New England Patriots]] had a "light" jersey (their alternate, a bright metallic silver) that is not white in which the other team would wear their colored, or "dark" jerseys against them since the [[third jersey]] rule was implemented in the NFL in 2002.

The Saints also introduced a 1967-style [[throwback uniform]] in a 23–20 win on December 1, 2002, against the [[2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. This uniform was not worn again until a 40–33 win against the [[Houston Texans]] on September 25, 2011, and also on November 6, 2011, against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in a 27–16 Saints win. However, the 2011 throwbacks use the current helmet, meaning the shades of gold on the helmet and jersey do not match.

In [[2006 NFL season|2006]], to honor their return to Louisiana, the Saints wore a patch on their uniforms with an outline of the State of Louisiana with a fleur-de-lis superimposed, similar to the logo from the 1980s.

The Saints originally planned to wear white jerseys at home for the 2006 season, but during the season, the players voted to wear the black jerseys at home after the second game. Since the team had informed the NFL office that they planned to wear white jerseys at home, each of the Saints' remaining home opponents would have to agree to New Orleans' request. The [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]] did not agree to the switch, forcing the Saints to wear white jerseys for those games.

Starting in week 13 of the 2006 season, the Saints wore black pants with the black jerseys against the San Francisco 49ers (restoring them after a four-season absence), and in a Week 16 game in [[Giants Stadium|The Meadowlands]] against the [[2006 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] (a 30–7 Saints win), the Saints wore the black pants with their road white jerseys. The Saints later stuck with the black pants in their 2006 playoff run.

Since 2008, the Saints have worn white jerseys at home for preseason games and early regular season home games.

In 2009, the Saints wore the black pants only once, beating St. Louis 28–23. They wore the white jerseys/gold pants combination during the [[Super Bowl XLIV]] victory over the [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]]. In 2012 and 2014, the Saints wore black pants 12 times and wore gold pants 4 times. In 2013, gold pants were used only 7 times (including playoffs). After 2015, a season in which the gold pants were donned 10 times, the Saints only wore them sporadically in the regular season, though they were still used regularly in the preseason.

Prior to the 2016 season, the NFL introduced the [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] program, and the Saints' version is a mixture of different uniform designs from earlier eras. White jersey tops featured old gold numbers with black trim along with gold and black sleeve stripes (a nod to the team's late 1960s uniforms). Complementing the uniforms were white pants (inspired from the 1975–85 look) and all-white socks. The Saints first wore the uniform during Week 11 of that season against the [[2016 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] on the road, and was worn on the road two more times thereafter. Its first home appearance came in Week 11 of the 2018 season against the [[2018 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]]; the Saints were forced to wear the white uniforms at home after head coach Sean Payton lost a bet with Eagles coach [[Doug Pederson]] during a charity golf event in the offseason.

In 2019, a variation of the all-white Color Rush look was unveiled during the Week 6 game against the [[2019 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]]. The Saints wore their current white uniforms, but paired them with white pants minus any striping (an inverse of their black pants). During the regular season, New Orleans went undefeated (8–0) while wearing either all-white uniform. As a result, they opted to wear the new all-white look at home during the [[2019–20 NFL playoffs#NFC:_Minnesota_Vikings_26,_New_Orleans_Saints_20_(OT)|Wild Card Round]] against the [[2019 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]. However, the Saints' luck finally ran out, losing in overtime 26–20.

==Stadium==
[[File:Superdome from Garage.jpg|thumb|right|215px|The Superdome has been the home of the Saints since 1975.]]
The [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] is the Saints' home stadium. It has a listed [[seating capacity]] of 76,468 (expanded) or 73,208 (not expanded). The Saints own a perfect record there against the [[Houston Texans]] (2–0) and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] (3–0), but a winless one against the [[Baltimore Ravens]] (0–2).

==Rivals==
===Divisional rivals===
====Atlanta Falcons====
{{main|Falcons–Saints rivalry}}
The Saints' oldest rival are the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons lead the rivalry series 53-50. The two clubs joined the NFL within a year of each other as expansion teams and have played each other twice a season since the Saints joined the league in 1967.

====Tampa Bay Buccaneers====
{{main|Buccaneers–Saints rivalry}}
The Saints have a developing rivalry with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], who have been part of the NFC South with the Saints since 2002.

The teams actually played each other quite often as non-division rivals. Between 1977 and 2001, there were only five years in which the teams did not play. This includes 12 years in a row from 1981 to 1992 – all as a result of the scheduling formulas in place prior to 2002 (this remains a record for most consecutive years in which two teams not from the same division met each other).

The Saints won 13 of 20 games as non-division opponents. Since becoming division rivals, the Saints have the edge in the series, winning 16 games to the Bucs' 10.

One notable pre-division game is a 1977 matchup that resulted in Tampa Bay's first win in franchise history coming against New Orleans after previously starting out 0–26 overall.

====Carolina Panthers====
The Saints and the Carolina Panthers have been minor rivals since Carolina joined the league as an expansion franchise in 1995. The teams have been divisional rivals since then, originally in the NFC West and then in the NFC South since 2002. This series has been extremely close. As of the end of the 2019 season, the Saints own the series by a game lead.

Carolina defeated New Orleans on the road every year from 2002 to 2008, a streak of seven seasons. Notable games include Carolina's 19–7 home victory in 1996 that sparked Saints head coach [[Jim E. Mora|Jim Mora]]'s infamous "Diddley Poo" rant and resignation from the team, Carolina's 10–6 win in the 2002 season finale at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]] to knock the Saints out of the playoffs, and the emotional 2005 season opener at Carolina where the Saints won 23–20 in the face of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and an eventual 3–13 season.
 
In their last game in the [[2014 NFL season]], a fight between players broke out in the end zone and spilled out into the tunnel entrance after a Cam Newton touchdown, with Panther's tight end [[Brandon Williams (tight end)|Brandon Williams]] getting ejected and both teams receiving offsetting penalties. The Panthers won the contest 41–10, with early turnovers by the Saints being a factor in the blowout.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hanzus|first1=Dan|title=Panthers, Saints involved in wild fracas at Superdome|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000439678/article/panthers-saints-involved-in-wild-fracas-at-superdome|website=[[NFL.com]]|accessdate=February 11, 2016|date=December 8, 2014}}</ref>

On January 7, 2018, the two teams met in the NFL playoffs for the first time in the Wild Card round. It was the first ever playoff game between NFC South teams since the division's formation in 2002. The Saints beat the Panthers 31–26, thus eliminating Carolina. The rivalry has been heated since then.

Until the selection of Rickey Jackson in 2010, there had been no players in the Hall of Fame who earned their credentials primarily as Saints; the others were chosen for their work with previous teams. Jim Finks’ tenure as Saints general manager was a significant factor in his selection.
When offensive tackle Willie Roaf was selected in 2012, he became the second Saint to earn his Hall of Fame credentials mostly while in New Orleans. Roaf was a member of the NFL's All-Decade team of the '90s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PlayerId=300 |title=Hall of Famers » WILLIE ROAF |publisher=Profootballhof.com |date= |accessdate=January 25, 2013}}</ref> Morten Andersen was selected in 2017, becoming the third former player inducted primarily for their accomplishments in New Orleans. Andersen was only the second full-time placekicker inducted into the Hall of Fame (the other was [[Jan Stenerud]] in 1991).<ref>[Duncan, Jeff (August 6, 2017), [https://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2017/08/morten_andersen_early_hall_of.html "A great night for the Great Dane: Morten Andersen becomes Saints' third Hall of Famer"], Nola.com.</ref>

[[File:Saintsations cheerleaders.jpg|thumb|150px|Saintsations performing at halftime]]
The [[Saintsations]] are the [[NFL Cheerleading|cheerleading]] squad for the Saints. A cheerleading squad has existed since the franchise's founding, but the current name was only adopted in 1987.

==Radio and television==
[[File:New Orleans Saints radio affiliates.png|thumb|right|Map of radio affiliates.]]
The Saints' [[flagship]] station is [[WWL (AM)|WWL]] (870 AM/[[WWL-FM|105.3 FM]]), one of the oldest radio stations in the city of New Orleans and one of the nation's most powerful as a [[clear-channel station]] with 50,000 watts of power.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Orleans Saints Radio Network Affiliates|url=https://www.neworleanssaints.com/news/broadcasting|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NewOrleansSaints.com|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref> Former Saints guard [[Zach Strief]] is the play-by-play announcer, with former Saints running back [[Deuce McAllister]] as color commentator. Strief succeeded longtime play-by-play announcer [[Jim Henderson (Sportscaster)|Jim Henderson]] in 2018, and McAllister succeeded another former Saints running back, [[Hokie Gajan]], in the role after Gajan's death on April 11, 2016, from [[liposarcoma]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Triplett|first1=Mike|title=Hokie Gajan, ex-Saints fullback, radio voice, dies at 56 of cancer|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/15188089/new-orleans-saints-lose-another-ex-fb-radio-voice-hokie-gajan|website=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=April 12, 2016|date=April 12, 2016}}</ref> Henderson was the play-by-play announcer for Saints radio broadcasts continuously from 1993 to 2017, and previously held the position from 1986–89 after serving as a color commentator from 1981–85, and again in 1992, when Dave Garrett was play-by-play announcer. Previous color commentators include former Saints players [[Jim Taylor (fullback)|Jim Taylor]] (RB, 1967), [[Steve Stonebreaker]] (LB, 1967-68), [[Danny Abramowicz]] (WR, 1967-73), [[Archie Manning]] (QB, 1971–82) and [[Stan Brock]] (OT, 1980–91).

Most preseason games are televised by [[WVUE-DT|WVUE]] (Channel 8), a station which until its outright 2017 sale to [[Raycom Media]] (and subsequent sale in 2019 to [[Gray Television]]) was owned by a [[consortium]] led by Saints owner Tom Benson since mid-2008 (that consortium, now led by Gayle Benson, continues to hold a minority stake in the station). As the Fox affiliate for New Orleans, it carries the majority of Saints games; WVUE also carries a heavy complement of coach and player shows. [[Tim Brando]] and [[Jon Stinchcomb]] call the preseason games for the Saints.

Saints preseason games were previously produced by [[Cox Sports Television]]. Beginning in the 2015 season, owing to Raycom's management of the station on behalf of Tom Benson's ownership group, production of preseason telecasts were taken over by [[Raycom Sports]] under a new multi-year deal, and syndicated to Raycom stations and others around the team's footprint.<ref name=saints-raycomsports>{{cite news|title=New Orleans Saints, Raycom Media announce partnership|url=https://www.neworleanssaints.com/news/new-orleans-saints-raycom-media-announce-partnership-15078080|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NewOrleansSaints.com|date=December 24, 2015|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref> Regular season games are also aired on [[WWL-TV]], the local CBS station whenever they host an AFC opponent (and games vs. NFC opponents cross-flexed from Fox to CBS) and NBC affiliate [[WDSU-TV|WDSU]] via ''Sunday Night Football'', with the latter also syndicating ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games for local airing from sister operation [[ESPN]].
