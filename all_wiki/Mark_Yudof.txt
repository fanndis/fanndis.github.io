==== California budget crisis ====

The [[California budget crisis]] resulted in massive cuts to higher education by the California State Legislature and Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref name="California's crisis hits its prized universities"/> Struggling to grapple with the ensuing crisis, California legislative leaders cut more than 20 percent from the UC budget in one year - the largest budgetary reduction in the history of the UC. In a July 9 [https://web.archive.org/web/20130901191548/http://www.ucop.edu/president/biography/index.html "Open Letter to UC alumni and friends,"] UC Regent Richard Blum; [[Russell Gould]], then-chair; Sherry Lansing, then-vice chair; and UC president Yudof wrote, <blockquote>
"The UC model — providing universal access to a top-notch, low-cost education and research of the highest caliber — continues to be studied around the globe among those who would emulate its success. And yet, this model has been increasingly abandoned at home by a state government responsible for its core funding."<ref name="California's crisis hits its prized universities">{{Cite news|title=California's crisis hits its prized universities|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1911455,00.html|first=Kevin|last=O'Leary|date=18 July 2009|accessdate=2010-03-22|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>
</blockquote>

As state budgetary support declined dramatically, Yudof kicked off an [http://www.ucforcalifornia.org/uc4ca/home/ online grassroots advocacy effort] in order to make the case for the University of California. In 2008, Yudof became the first president of a major research university to organize advocacy efforts using [http://www.ucforcalifornia.org/uc4ca/home/ email], [http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/budget/ blogs], [https://twitter.com/mark_yudof Twitter], [https://www.facebook.com/ucforcalifornia?v=app_2373072738&ref=ts#/group.php?gid=6756592601&ref=ts Facebook], and other social media components. Yudof called on all students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends to unite behind an aggressive push to make funding UC a state priority.

In 2009, Yudof further bolstered this effort through a campaign seeking to let legislators and the governor know how critical their support is in preserving the university's commitment to quality and student access.<ref>UC Newsroom http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/22360{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Also in 2009, Yudof came under criticism for an interview that he gave to Deborah Solomon of the [[New York Times]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/magazine/27fob-q4-t.html Big Man on Campus], in which he joked about taking a pay cut from his salary of over $800,000 to $400,000 in exchange for the White House and Air Force One.

====Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan ====

In February 2009,<ref>UC Announces Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/19471/{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> upon President Yudof's recommendation, the [[University of California Board of Regents]] unanimously approved a new [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] plan intended to support college access for lower-income families and students. Under the policy, known as the [http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/blueandgold/ ''Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan''], undergraduates who are in their first four years of attendance at UC—or two for transfer students—will receive enough scholarship and grant assistance to at least fully cover their systemwide UC fees if they have incomes below $80,000 and meet other basic eligibility requirements for need-based financial aid.

==== Project You Can ====

In October 2009, seeking to help keep the University of California accessible and affordable for California students, President Yudof announced an ambitious effort that aims to raise $1 billion for student support over the next four years. Through the fundraising effort, [http://youcan.universityofcalifornia.edu/ ''Project You Can''], all 10 UC campuses have committed to raise $1 billion in the aggregate over the next four years—doubling the amount of private support the system has raised for scholarships, fellowships and other gift aid in the previous five years.<ref>UC Newsroom announcement http://youcan.universityofcalifornia.edu/scholarships.html</ref> The UC Board of Regents endorsed the effort at its November 2009 meeting. Yudof made the [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/10/uc-announces-new-fundraising-campaign.html Project You Can announcement] at Sunnyside High School, which for 10 years has propelled promising students toward health careers through its Doctors Academy, a program sponsored by UCSF Fresno. Despite facing social and economic barriers — 87 percent of Sunnyside's students are eligible for free or reduced lunch — all Doctors Academy graduates have gone on to college, 43 percent of them at UC campuses.

== Selected papers ==

Citing increasingly unreliable funding provided to universities by state government, President Yudof called for the [[federal government]] to bolster its financial commitments to the nation's universities and colleges in his paper titled [https://web.archive.org/web/20130901191548/http://www.ucop.edu/president/biography/index.html ''Exploring a New Role for Federal Government in Higher Education'']. In announcing the proposal, Yudof remarked:
<ref>UC Budget blog, http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/budget/?p=950{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
<blockquote>We must find creative ways to expand the federal commitment to research and access into a new category: The nuts-and-bolts core funding that is vital to a robust university, allowing it to hire quality professors, equip laboratories and expand the physical plant.</blockquote>

[[New York Times]] columnist [[Bob Herbert]] visited the [[UC Berkeley]] campus and had this to say: <blockquote>
The problems at Berkeley are particularly acute because of the state's drastic reduction of support. But colleges and universities across the country — public and private — are struggling because of the prolonged economic crisis and the pressure on state budgets. It will say a great deal about what kind of nation we've become if we let these most valuable assets slip into a period of decline.
</blockquote>  His op-ed piece, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/03/opinion/03herbert.html?_r=3&amp;ref=opinion "Cracks in the Future,"] ran in the [[New York Times]] citing [[UC Berkeley]] as evidence of the cracks appearing in America's cornerstone of civilization - higher education.<ref>Bob Herbert, The New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/03/opinion/03herbert.html?_r=3&amp;ref=opinion</ref>
