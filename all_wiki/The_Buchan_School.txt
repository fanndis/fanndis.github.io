'''The Buchan School''' ({{lang-gv|Yn Scoill Buchan}}) is an independent primary school in the south of the [[Isle of Man]], catering for children aged 3â€“11.  It is the junior school of [[King William's College]].

==History==
The Buchan School was established by Lady Laura Buchan in the 1875 as a "school for females" and was originally known as The High School for Girls.  The original campus was located on Douglas Road, on the promenade in [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]], however the school soon out-grew its original site and moved to a new site named "Westhill" about a mile away.  In 1991 The Buchan amalgamated with [[King William's College]] and changed to a co-educational prep school for [[King William's College]].  {{As of|2005}} the school had approximately 250 pupils.  The Buchan is the only independent primary school on the [[Isle of Man]].

==Houses==
The Buchan comprises four houses.  Every pupil in the school is a member of one of the houses and represents them in awards and sporting events.  The school used to have a boarding house however this closed in 1999. The houses are named after famous Norse [[King of Mann|rulers of the Isle of Man]].[http://www.buchan.sch.im/school_life_houses.asp]
