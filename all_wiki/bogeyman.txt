The '''Bogeyman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ə|ʊ|g|i|m|æ|n|,_|ˈ|b|oʊ|g|i|-}};<ref>{{cite web|title=efinition of bogeyman noun from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bogeyman?q=bogeyman|work=[[Oxford University Press]]|publisher=[[Oxfor University Press]]|accessdate=3 June 2020}}</ref> also spelled '''boogeyman''', '''bogyman''', '''bogieman''', '''boogie monster''', '''boogie man''', or '''boogie woogie''') is a type of [[mythical creature]] used by adults to frighten children into good behavior. Bogeymen have no specific appearance, and conceptions vary drastically by household and culture, but they are most commonly depicted as [[masculine]] or [[Androgyny|androgynous]] [[monsters]] that punish children for [[misbehavior]].<ref>Shimabukuro, Karra (2014). "The Bogeyman of Your Nightmares: Freddy Krueger's Folkloric Roots". ''Studies in Popular Culture'', '''36''' (2), 45–65.</ref> The Bogeyman or conceptually similar monsters can be found in many cultures around the world. Bogeymen may target a specific act or general misbehaviour, depending on what purpose needs serving, often based on a warning from the child's [[authority figure]]. The term "Bogeyman" is sometimes used as a non-specific [[Anthropomorphism|personification]] or [[Metonymy|metonym]] for [[Fear|terror]], and in some cases, the [[Devil]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/what-is-the-bogeyman/|title=What's the Bogeyman?|first=Krystal|last=D'Costa|website=Scientific American Blog Network}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''bogey'' is believed to be derived from the [[Middle English]] ''bogge'' / ''bugge'' ("something frightening", "[[scarecrow]]"). Theories on its origin include a root meaning "[[goat]]", or a cognate of the [[German language|German]] ''bögge'', ''böggel-mann'' ("[[goblin]]"). It could be influenced in meaning by Old English -budda used in compounds for "beetle".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/bug|title=bug &#124; Origin and meaning of bug by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref>
A related word, ''[[bugbear]]'', from ''bug'', meaning goblin or scarecrow, and ''[[bear]]'', was imagined as a demon in the form of a bear that eats small children, and was also used to mean a general object of dread.<ref>{{OEtymD|bugbear}}</ref> The word ''[[wikt:bug-a-boo|bugaboo]]'', with a similar pair of meanings, may have arisen as an alteration of ''bugbear''.<ref>{{OEtymD|bugaboo}}</ref>

The word could also be linked to many similar words in other [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]: ''bogle'' ([[Scots language|Scots]]), ''bûzeman'' ([[West Frisian language|Western Frisian]]), ''boeman'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''Butzemann'' ([[German language|German]]), ''busemann'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''bøhmand'' / ''bussemand'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''bòcan'', ''[[púca]]'', ''pooka'' or ''pookha'' ([[Irish language|Irish]]), ''pwca'', ''bwga'' or ''bwgan'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''puki'' ([[Old Norse]]), ''bucca'' ([[Cornish language|Cornish]]), ''puck'' ([[English language|English]]), ''bogu'' ([[Slavic languages|Slavonic]]), ''buka'' or ''babay/babayka'' ([[Russian language|Russian]], [[wikt:бука|бука]]), ''bauk'' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]), ''bubulis'' ([[Latvian language|Latvian]]), ''baubas'' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), ''bobo'' ([[Polish language|Polish]]), bubák ([[Czech language|Czech]]), bubák ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]), ''bebok'' ([[Silesian language|Silesian]]), ''papão'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), ''babulas'' ([[Greek Language|Greek]],  μπαμπούλας), ''bua'' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]], ბუა), ''babau'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), бабай ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), baubau ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]), and ''papu'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]).<ref name="Cooper">Cooper, Brian. "Lexical reflections inspired by Slavonic *bogǔ: English bogey from a Slavonic root?" ''[[Transactions of the Philological Society]]'', Volume 103, Number 1, April 2005, pp. 73–97(25)</ref>

In [[Southeast Asia]], the term is popularly supposed to refer to [[Bugis]]<ref>{{cite news |title=In Indonesia |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/26/AR2007012600613.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=2007-10-17 |first=John |last=Auchard | author-link = John Auchard |date=2007-01-28}}</ref> or [[Bugis|Buganese]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.on-the-edge.com/articles/raja_ampat.php |title=The Buginese of Sulawesi |accessdate=2007-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927102743/http://www.on-the-edge.com/articles/raja_ampat.php |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> [[pirates]], ruthless seafarers of southern [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]'s third-largest island. These pirates often plagued early English and Dutch trading ships of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] and [[Dutch East India Company]]. It is popularly believed that this resulted in the European sailors bringing their fear of the "bugi men" back to their home countries. However, etymologists disagree with this, because words relating to ''bogeyman'' were in common use centuries before European colonization of Southeast Asia.

In [[Luo dialects]] in Eastern Africa the term 'bwogo' (with pronunciation sound like 'booga') means to scare. This correlation is most likely spurious as [[Nilotic language]] roots predate the modern concept of civilization itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://economics.ozier.com/language/dholuo.html|title=Luo (Dholuo) Phrases and Basics|website=economics.ozier.com}}</ref>{{clarify|date=October 2020}}

===Physical description and personality===
While the description of the Bogeyman differs on a cultural level, there are often some shared similarities to the creatures. Many of the Bogeyman are depicted as having claws, talons, and sharp teeth. Along with that, the majority of Bogeyman are of the spirit variety, while the minority are demons, witches, and other [[legendary creature]]s. Some are even described to have certain [[animal]] features such as horns, hooves, and bug like appearances.<ref name="mythology.net">{{Cite web|url=https://mythology.net/mythical-creatures/bogeyman/|title=Bogeyman (Boogeyman or Boogie Man): Mythical Monster|first=Prof|last=Geller|date=April 3, 2018|website=Mythology.net}}</ref>

When looking at the personality traits of the Bogeyman, they are most easily divided into three categories; the kind that punishes misbehaved children, the kind that are more prone to violence, and the kind that protect the innocent. They all relate in the same way, being that they all exist to teach young children lessons. The large majority of Bogeyman are there to just frighten children with punishments, and not actually inflict much damage. The more vicious Bogeyman is said to steal the children at night, and even eat them. The last category is the Bogeyman who protect people and only punish those guilty, regardless of age.<ref name="mythology.net"/>

===Other putative origins===
Because of such a global impact, it makes it difficult to find the original source of the legends. The first reference to the Bogeyman would be considered the hobgoblins described in England, in the 1500s. Many believed that they were made to torment humans, and while some only played simple pranks, others were more foul in nature.<ref name="mythology.net"/>

==Analogues in other cultures==
Bogeyman-like beings are almost universal, common to the folklore of many countries.

===Sack Man===
{{Main|Sack Man}}
In many countries, a bogeyman variant is portrayed as a man with a sack on his back who carries naughty children away. This is true for many Latin countries, such as [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and the countries of [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], where he is referred to as ''el "Hombre del costal"'', ''el "hombre del saco"'', or in Portuguese, ''o "homem do saco"'' (all of which mean "the sack/bag man"), or el roba-chicos, meaning ''child-stealer''. Similar legends are also very common in Eastern Europe (e.g. Bulgarian ''Torbalan'', "sack man"), as well as in Haiti and some countries in Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/abcfoto/revelado/20140925/abci-crimen-hombre-saco-201409242057.html|title=El verdadero "Hombre del Saco" - ABC.es|date=September 24, 2014|website=ABC.es}}</ref>

===El Coco===
{{Main|Coco (folklore)}}
El Coco (also ''El Cuco'' and ''Cucuy'', sometimes called ''El Bolo'') is a monster common to many Spanish-speaking countries.

In [[Spain]], parents will sing lullabies or tell rhymes to children, warning them that if they do not sleep, ''El Coco'' will come to get them. The rhyme originated in the 17th century and has evolved over the years, but still retains its original meaning. [[Coconut]]s (Spanish: ''coco'') received that name because the hairy, brown "face" created by the coconut shell's three indentations reminded the Portuguese sailers of "Coco". Latin America also has El Coco, although its folklore is usually quite different, commonly mixed with native beliefs, and, because of cultural contacts, sometimes more related to the boogeyman of the United States. However, the term ''El Coco'' is also used in Spanish-speaking [[Latin America]]n countries, such as [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]], [[Peru]], [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Venezuela]], although there it is more usually called ''El Cuco'', as in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]]. Among Mexican-Americans, ''El Cucuy'' is portrayed as an evil monster that hides under children's beds at night and kidnaps or eats the child that does not obey his/her parents or go to sleep when it is time to do so. However, the Spanish American bogeyman does not resemble the shapeless or hairy monster of Spain: social sciences professor Manuel Medrano says popular legend describes ''El cucuy'' as a small humanoid with glowing red eyes that hides in closets or under the bed. "Some lore has him as a kid who was the victim of violence... and now he's alive, but he's not," Medrano said, citing [[Xavier Garza]]'s 2004 book ''Creepy Creatures and other Cucuys''."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/ts_comments.php?id=P67839_0_10_0_C|title=El cucuy has roots deep in border folklore}}</ref>

===A Cuca===
{{Main|Cuca (folklore)}}
In [[Brazil]] folklore, a similar character called ''Cuca'' is depicted as a female humanoid alligator, or an old lady with a sack. There's a famous lullaby sung by most parents to their children that says that ''The Cuca'' will come to get them and make a soup or soap made of them if they do not sleep, just as in Spain. The ''Cuca'' is also a character of [[Monteiro Lobato]]'s ''[[Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (novel series)|Sítio do Picapau Amarelo]]'' ("Yellow Woodpecker's Farm"), an acclaimed and creative series of short novels written for children which contain a large number of famous characters from Brazilian folklore.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141628/http://www.alonsoquijano.org/cursos2004/animateca/recursos/Biblioteca%20virtual/C1.%20Tradiciones%20y%20Literatura%20Infantil/17.%20Eloy%20Martos.pdf]</ref>

===Babau===
{{Redirect|Babau}}

In the countries of central and eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], children who misbehave are threatened with a creature known as "babau" (or "baubau", "baobao", "bavbav", or "بعبع (Bu'Bu'" or similar). In [[Italy]], the Babau (in Romania, Bau-bau) is also called ''l'uomo nero'' (Romanian: ''omul negru'') or "black man". In Italy, he is portrayed as a tall man wearing a heavy black coat, with a black hood or hat which hides his face. Sometimes, parents will knock loudly under the table, pretending that someone is knocking at the door, and say something like: "Here comes ''l'uomo nero''! He must know that there's a child here who doesn't want to drink his soup!". It is also featured in a widespread nursery rhyme in Italy: "Ninna nanna ninna oh, questo bimbo a chi lo do? Lo darò all' uomo nero, che lo tiene un anno intero." (English: "Lullaby Lulla Oh, who do I give this child to? I will give him to the Boogeyman, who's going to keep him for a whole year")  ''L'uomo nero'' is not supposed to eat or harm children, but instead takes them away to a mysterious and frightening place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filastrocche.it/nostalgici/ninne/ninna5.htm|title=Ninna Nanna, Ninna oh|work=filastrocche.it}}</ref>

===Butzemann===
[[Germanic folklore]] has dozens of different figures that correspond to the Bogeyman. These have various appearances (such as of a gnome, man, animal, monster, ghost or devil) and are sometimes said to appear at very specific places (such as in forests, at water bodies, cliffs, cornfields or vineyards). These figures are called by many different names which are often only regionally known. One of these, possibly etymologically related to the Bogeyman, is the ''[[:de:Butzemann|Butzemann]]'', which can be of gnome-like or other demonic or ghostly appearance. Other examples include the ''Buhmann'' (who is mostly proverbial) and ''der schwarze Mann'' ("The Dark Man"), an inhuman creature which hides in the dark corners under the bed or in the closet and carries children away. The figure is part of the children's game [[:de:Wer hat Angst vorm Schwarzen Mann?|"Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann?"]] ("Who is afraid of the bogeyman?").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/09/01/boogeyman/|title=Who's Afraid of the Boogeyman?

*[[Finland]] – The equivalent of the Bogeyman in Finland is ''mörkö''. The most famous usage of the word these days takes place in [[Moomin]]-stories (originally written in Swedish) in which ''mörkö'' ([[the Groke]]) is a large, frightening, dark blue, ghost-like creature. The children's game "Kuka pelkää Mustaa Pekkaa?" ("Who's Afraid of Black Peter?") was also commonly played among children through to the 1960s and '70s, especially in urban settings, as a backyard game (see Germany's "Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann?").<ref name="europeisnotdead.com"/>

*[[Greece]] – In Greek, the common translation of "Bogeyman" is "Baboulas" (Μπαμπούλας), which is pronounced babʊlas. It is used by the parents to scare their children so they won't misbehave, probably. This creature is supposed to be some kind of cannibal that eats the children. That's why the most used phrase about the creature is "Ο Μπαμπούλας θα έρθει και θα σε φάει", which means "The Bogeyman will come and eat you".
*[[Hungary]] –  The Hungarian equivalent of the Bogeyman is the ''Mumus'', which is a monster-like creature, and the ''Zsákos Ember'', a man with a sack, which is the literal meaning of his name. A third creature is the ''Rézfaszú bagoly'' ("Copperpenis Owl"), a giant owl with a copper penis.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0xAAAAIAAJ | title=A mágia | publisher=[[Magvető]] | author=Makra, Sándor | year=1988| isbn=9789631413076 }}</ref>
*[[Iceland]] – The Icelandic equivalent of the Bogeyman is [[Grýla]], a female troll who would take misbehaving children and eat them during [[Christmas Eve]].

In the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], children are often mock-threatened with the ''Rettai Kannan'' (the two-eyed one) or ''Poochaandi'' (பூச்சாண்டி), a monster or fearsome man that children are sometimes threatened with if they are not obedient or refuse to eat. In the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]], the equivalent of the bogeyman is ''Boochodu''. In central [[Kerala]], the bogeyman is referred to as "Kokkachi", who will "take away" children for disobeying their parents or misbehaving in any manner; and in South Kerala, the bogeyman is called "Oochandi". Among Konkani-speaking people of the Western Coast of India, "Gongo" is the Bogeyman equivalent. Among [[Marathi language]] speaking people (predominantly of [[Maharashtra]]), parents threaten the misbehaving children with a male ghost called "Bāgul Buā" (बागुल बुवा). In general, the "Buā" is supposed to kidnap children when they misbehave or do not sleep.<ref name="nasir-eclectic.blogspot.com"/> In the eastern state of [[Odisha]] the bogeyman is referred to as "Baaya"(ବାୟା).
