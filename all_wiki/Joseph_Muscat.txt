After three years Muscat claimed that he had presided over Malta's economic turnaround, and – amongst others – was instrumental for the introduction and strengthening of [[civil liberties]], improvements in the health and energy sector, and the elimination of out-of-stock medicines, the reduction in energy tariffs, the introduction of free-childcare centres, higher social benefits to parents and the youth employment guarantee.<ref name=":10">{{cite news |url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/63068/muscat_looks_back_at_three_years_in_government_economic_success_social_revolution#.WT2R_-t94kI |title=Muscat looks back at three years in government: 'economic success, social revolution' |last=Dalli |first=Miriam |date=11 March 2016 |work=MaltaToday |access-date=11 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421014522/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/63068/muscat_looks_back_at_three_years_in_government_economic_success_social_revolution |archive-date=21 April 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> 
Upon being elected to office, the Muscat administration found a worsening [[Deficit spending|public deficit]], a slowdown in the economy, the country's main utility provider on the verge of bankruptcy and a slowing economy in [[Gozo]]. The directional change resulted in economic growth of over 6%, the elimination of the public deficit and a decrease in the [[Government debt|public debt]] burden.<ref name=":10" /> Poverty was reduced and [[pension]]s were increased for the first time in 25 years. Muscat insisted that these results were delivered by his government as a team.<ref name=":10" /> Among others, the Muscat administration's family friendly measures led to a 9% increase in female participation in the labour market, substantial savings to first-time home buyers, the [[value-added tax]] car registration refund, in-work benefits to low-income couples and single parents, stipends given to 900 students who repeated a year and the introduction of [[civil union]]s. Muscat admitted that his first administration had its challenges, namely the [[Environmental protection|environment]] and [[good governance]].<ref name=":10" />

==== Corruption ====

{{main|2019 Malta political crisis}}

In October 2017, investigative journalist [[Daphne Caruana Galizia]] died in a car bomb attack. Muscat promised to "leave no stone unturned" in the subsequent investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/81358/caruana_galizia_murder_muscat_pledges_no_stone_will_be_left_unturned|title=Caruana Galizia murder: Muscat pledges no stone will be left unturned|last=Sansone|first=Kurt|date=16 October 2017|website=MaltaToday.com.mt|language=en|access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref> The opposition blamed Muscat for what they deemed a "political murder" and for the collapse of the rule of law in the country. In the following two years, Muscat spoke very sparingly of the Caruana Galizia case and of the periodic protests that took place in Valletta. Government employees were tasked with clearing a makeshift memorial to Caruana Galizia at the [[Great Siege Monument]] in Valletta on a regular basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/minister-gave-order-to-clear-daphne-memorial-site-court-told.694144|title=Minister gave order to clear Daphne memorial site, court told|last=Brincat|first=Edwina|date=12 November 2018|website=Times of Malta|language=en-gb|access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref>

Muscat faced accusations of failing to take action against two close aides: [[Keith Schembri]], his chief of staff, and [[Konrad Mizzi]], tourism and formerly energy minister, whose business and underworld links had been subject to judiciary and administrative investigations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/23/joseph-muscat-malta-political-career-lost-lustre|title=How Joseph Muscat's glittering political career lost its lustre|last=Kirchgaessner|first=Stephanie|date=23 April 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=13 January 2020|last2=Garside|first2=Juliette|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Around the [[2019 European Parliament election|2019 European elections]], Muscat was touted for an EU job, possibly as successor to [[Donald Tusk]] as head of the [[European Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/europe/95970/europes_top_posts_and_muscats_chances|title=Europe’s top posts and Muscat’s chances|last=Sansone|first=Kurt|date=30 June 2019|website=MaltaToday.com.mt|language=en|access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref> His bid failed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/prime-minister-joseph-muscat-was-close-to-becoming-european-council-president/|title=Prime Minister Joseph Muscat was close to becoming European Council President - TVM News|website=TVM English|language=en-US|access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref> While he had been a frontrunner to succeed Tusk back in 2017, in 2019 his image was tainted by the Caruana Galizia murder and the multiple reports of European institutions warning about the erosion of the [[rule of law]] in Malta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theshiftnews.com/2019/07/05/the-race-for-an-eu-post-a-story-of-how-far-joseph-muscat-has-fallen/|title=The race for an EU post: ‘A story of how far Joseph Muscat has fallen’|last=Muscat|first=Caroline|date=5 July 2019|website=The Shift News|language=en-US|access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref>

In late November 2019, Muscat's premiership was rocked by the arrest of prominent businessman [[Yorgen Fenech]] and the implication of Muscat's chief of staff [[Keith Schembri]].

==Health==
On 7 April 2014, Muscat suffered from temporary blindness caused by UV radiation, probably related to burns to his cornea. Like 60 other people with similar symptoms, he had participated at a political rally the day before.<ref>Miriam Dalli, [http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/37784/prime_minister_ordered_to_stay_at_home_as_his_vision_slowly_returns#.U0xj5ccjxl8 "Minister, parliamentary secretaries return to work"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410211439/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/37784/prime_minister_ordered_to_stay_at_home_as_his_vision_slowly_returns |date=10 April 2014}}, ''Malta Today'', 8 April 2014.</ref>
