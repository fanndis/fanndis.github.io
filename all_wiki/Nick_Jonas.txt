'''Nicholas Jerry Jonas''' (born September 16, 1992)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/nick-jonas-mn0002515882 | title = Nick Jonas | publisher = [[Allmusic.com]] | accessdate= November 10, 2013}}</ref> is an American singer, songwriter and actor. Jonas began acting in theater at the age of seven, and released his debut single in 2002 which caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] where Jonas formed a band with his older brothers, [[Joe Jonas|Joe]] and [[Kevin Jonas|Kevin]], known as the [[Jonas Brothers]]. The group released their debut studio album ''[[It's About Time (Jonas Brothers album)|It's About Time]]'' through the Columbia label in 2006. After leaving Columbia Records and signing with [[Hollywood Records]], the group released their [[Jonas Brothers (album)|self-titled second studio album]] in 2007, which became their breakthrough record. The band became prominent figures on the [[Disney Channel]] during this time, gaining a large following through the network and they appeared in the widely successful musical television film ''[[Camp Rock]]'' (2008) and its sequel ''[[Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam]]'' (2010) as well as two of their own series, ''[[Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream]]'' (2008–2010) and ''[[Jonas (TV series)|Jonas]]'' (2009–2010).

The band's third studio album, ''[[A Little Bit Longer]]'' (2008), saw continued commercial success for the group; the album's lead single "[[Burnin' Up (Jonas Brothers song)|Burnin' Up]]" hit the top five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Following the release of their fourth studio album, ''[[Lines, Vines and Trying Times]]'' (2009), the Jonas Brothers confirmed a hiatus. Nick formed a new band known as [[Nick Jonas & the Administration]], who released the album ''[[Who I Am (Nick Jonas & the Administration album)|Who I Am]]'' in 2010. Afterward, Jonas shifted his focus to acting and had a recurring role on the television series ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]''.

After the group's official disbandment in 2013, Jonas began work on his second solo studio album, signing with [[Island Records]] and releasing ''[[Nick Jonas (album)|Nick Jonas]]'' through the label in 2014, which saw the commercial success of the single "[[Jealous (Nick Jonas song)|Jealous]]". Jonas later co-founded [[Safehouse Records]], a record label in conjunction with the Island and Hollywood labels. His third studio album ''[[Last Year Was Complicated]]'' (2016) peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in the United States. Following the release, Jonas won the Songwriters Hall of Fame's Hal David Starlight Award in 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.songhall.org/special-awards | title = Songwriters Hall of Fame Special Awards | publisher = [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] | accessdate= December 12, 2013}}</ref> In 2017, Jonas appeared in the adventure comedy film ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'', which became the [[2017 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of the year]].
