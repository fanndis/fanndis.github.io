The festival consists of competitive sections for American and international dramatic and documentary films, both feature films and short films, and a group of out-of-competition sections, including NEXT, New Frontier, Spotlight, Midnight, Premieres, and Documentary Premieres.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

== History ==
=== 1978: Utah/US Film Festival ===
Sundance began in [[Salt Lake City]] in August 1978 as the Utah/US Film Festival in an effort to attract more filmmakers to Utah.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/sundance/history_of_sundance.shtml|title=BBC - Films - Sundance Film Festival - A Brief History|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-14}}</ref> It was founded by [[Sterling Van Wagenen]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/about/blogs/news/redfords-wildwood-enterprises-and-pbs-bring-skinwalkers-to-the-small-screen-february-21-2002/|title=Redford's Wildwood Enterprises and PBS Bring "Skinwalkers" to the Small Screen {{!}} PBS About|website=Redford's Wildwood Enterprises and PBS Bring "Skinwalkers" to the Small Screen {{!}} PBS About|access-date=2018-01-28}}</ref> head of [[Robert Redford]]'s company Wildwood, and John Earle of the [[Utah Film Commission]]. The 1978 festival featured films such as ''[[Deliverance]]'', ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', ''[[Mean Streets]]'', and ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]''.<ref>{{cite web

The goal of the festival was to showcase American-made films, highlight the potential of independent film, and increase visibility for filmmaking in Utah. The main focus of the event was to conduct a competition for independent American films, present a series of retrospective films and filmmaker panel discussions, and celebrate the [[Frank Capra]] Award. The festival also highlighted the work of regional filmmakers who worked outside the [[Hollywood]] system.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In 1979, Sterling Van Wagenen left to head up the first-year pilot program of what became the [[Sundance Institute]], and James W. Ure took over briefly as executive director, followed by Cirina Hampton Catania. More than 60 films were screened at the festival that year, and panels featured many well-known Hollywood filmmakers. Also that year, the first Frank Capra Award went to [[Jimmy Stewart]]. The festival also made a profit for the first time. In 1980, Catania left to pursue a production career in Hollywood.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===1981: US Film and Video Festival===
In 1981, the festival moved to Park City, Utah, and changed the dates from September to January. The move from late summer to midwinter was done by the executive director Susan Barrell with the cooperation of Hollywood director [[Sydney Pollack]], who suggested that running a film festival in a ski resort during winter would draw more attention from Hollywood. It was called the US Film and Video Festival.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

=== 1984: Sundance ===
In 1984, the now well-established Sundance Institute, headed by Sterling Van Wagenen, took over management of the US Film Festival. Gary Beer and Van Wagenen spearheaded production of the inaugural US Film Festival presented by Sundance Institute (1985), which included Program Director Tony Safford and Administrative Director Jenny Walz Selby. The branding and marketing transition from the US Film Festival to the Sundance Film Festival was managed under the direction of Colleen Allen, Allen Advertising Inc., by appointment of Robert Redford. In 1991, the festival was officially renamed the Sundance Film Festival, after Redford's character [[the Sundance Kid]] from the film ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''.<ref>{{cite web |first=Lauren David |last=Peden |title=Sundance Subdued |url=http://www.coastmagazine.com/archive/pre_dec05/travel_sundance.html |date=December 2005 |publisher=Freedom Orange County Information (coastmagazine.com) |accessdate=2007-11-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202623/http://www.coastmagazine.com/archive/pre_dec05/travel_sundance.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref>

The Sundance Film Festival experienced its extraordinary growth in the 1990s, under the leadership of Geoffrey Gilmore and John Cooper, who transformed the venue into the premier festival in the United States, on par of Cannes, Venice, Berlin, and Toronto International Film Festival.  That crucial era is very well documented in Professor '''Emanuel Levy''''s book, Cinema of Outsiders: The Rise of American Independent Cinema (NYU Press, 1999, 2001, 2011), the most comprehensive chronicle of Sundance and the Indie movement over the past four decades.{{according to whom|date=August 2020}}

== Growth of the festival ==
The festival has changed over the decades from a low-profile venue for small-budget, independent creators from outside the Hollywood system to a media extravaganza for Hollywood celebrity actors, paparazzi, and luxury lounges set up by companies not affiliated with Sundance. Festival organizers have tried curbing these activities in recent years, beginning in 2007 with their ongoing Focus On Film campaign.

The 2009 film ''Official Rejection'' documented the experience of small filmmakers trying to get into various festivals in the late 2000s, including Sundance. The film contained several arguments that Sundance had become dominated by large studios and sponsoring corporations. A contrast was made between the 1990s, in which non-famous filmmakers with tiny budget films could get distribution deals from studios like [[Miramax Films]] or [[New Line Cinema]], (like [[Kevin Smith]]'s ''Clerks''), and the 2000s, when major stars with multimillion-dollar films (like ''The Butterfly Effect'' with [[Ashton Kutcher]]) dominated the festival. Kevin Smith doubted that ''Clerks'', if made in the late 2000s, would be accepted to Sundance.<ref>Kevin Smith, interviewed in ''Official Rejection'', documentary film, 2009, directed by Paul Osborne</ref>

Numerous small festivals sprung up around Sundance in the Park City area, including [[Slamdance Film Festival|Slamdance]], [[Nodance Film Festival|Nodance]], [[Slumdance Film Festival|Slumdance]], It-dance, X-Dance, [[Lapdance]], [[Tromadance]], The [[Park City Film Music Festival]], etc., though all except{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Slamdance are no longer held.<ref>''Official Rejection'', documentary film, 2009, directed by Paul Osborne</ref>

Included in the Sundance changes made in 2010, a new programming category titled "NEXT" (often denoted simply by the characters "<=>", which mean "less is more") was introduced to showcase innovative films that are able to transcend the confines of an independent budget. Another recent addition was the Sundance Film Festival USA program, in which eight of the festival's films are shown in eight different theaters around the United States.<ref>{{cite news |date=January 22, 2010 |first=Cody |last=Clark |title=Redford launches 2010 Sundance Film Festival in Park City |url=http://heraldextra.com/news/local/article_38fab10a-0120-5c9a-bec2-b0c13dc56df8.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Herald (Utah)|The Daily Herald]] |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref>

The premiere of, American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]'s 2020 documentary film: ''[[Miss Americana]]'', at the opening night of the [[2020 Sundance Film Festival]] and Swift's pre-announced appearance at the festival, caused a great surge in the number of attendees, traction and media coverage, which was new to the normally reserved festival.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/26/sundance-in-miss-americana-taylor-swift-demotes-the-internet/|title=Sundance: In Miss Americana, Taylor Swift demotes the internet|last=Panzarino|first=Matthew|date=January 26, 2020|website=[[TechCrunch]]|access-date=February 6, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/miss-americana-taylor-swift-brings-her-raw-star-power-sundance-1272592|title=With 'Miss Americana,' Taylor Swift Brings Her Raw Star Power to Sundance|last=Sinha-Roy|first=Piya|date=January 24, 2020|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=February 6, 2020}}</ref>
