'''George John Tenet''' (born January 5, 1953) is a former [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI) for the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] as well as a Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy at [[Georgetown University]].

Tenet held the position as the DCI from July 1997 to July 2004, making him the second-longest-serving director in the agency's history—behind [[Allen Welsh Dulles]]—as well as one of the few DCIs to serve under two [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] of opposing [[Political party|political parties]]. He played a key role in overseeing [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|intelligence regarding weapons of mass destruction]] in advance of the [[Iraq War]]. A 2005 Inspector General's report found that Tenet bears "ultimate responsibility" for the United States intelligence community's failure to develop a plan to control al Qaeda in the lead-up to 9/11.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6957839.stm |title=CIA criticises ex-chief over 9/11|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=August 21, 2007|accessdate=February 29, 2008}}</ref> Tenet has been criticized for personally authorizing the CIA's use of brutal and ineffective [[enhanced interrogation techniques|torture techniques]] during his tenure, in contravention of international law.<ref>{{Cite news |first=David |last=Usborne |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/george-tenet-the-torturer-in-chief-9922189.html |title=George Tenet profile: The CIA's former head and torturer-in-chief |date=December 12, 2014 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=October 26, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/15/cia-torture-human-experimentation-doctors |title=CIA torture appears to have broken spy agency rule on human experimentation |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 15, 2015 |last=Ackerman |first=Spencer |accessdate=October 26, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-tenet-in-2007-we-dont-torture-people/ |title=George Tenet in 2007: "We don't torture people" |work=[[CBS News]] |date=December 9, 2014 |accessdate=October 26, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |ssrn=2714647|title=United States v.

In February 2008, he became a managing director at investment bank [[Allen & Company]].

==Early life==
George John Tenet was born on January 5, 1953, in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], [[Queens]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the son of [[Greeks|Greek]] immigrants Evangelia and John Tenet.<ref name="CNN Fast Facts">{{cite web|title=George Tenet Fast Facts |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/06/us/george-tenet-fast-facts/ |work=[[CNN]] |date=December 25, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203043527/http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/06/us/george-tenet-fast-facts/ |archivedate=February 3, 2014 |url-status=live |accessdate=December 30, 2013}}</ref> His father, born in [[Qeparo]], [[Himara]], [[Albania]] ([[Northern Epirus]]), worked in a coal mine in France before arriving in the United States via [[Ellis Island]] just before the [[Great Depression]]. His mother was a Greek from [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], Greece, who had fled from the communists by stowing away on a British submarine.{{sfn|Coll|2005|p=355}} 

Tenet was raised in [[Little Neck, Queens]], where as a teenager, he and his older brother Bill worked as [[busboy]]s in their family's diner, the Twentieth Century Diner. Despite Bill and George being [[fraternal twin]]s, both had different personalities; in his book ''[[Ghost Wars]]'', [[Steve Coll]] described Bill as "reserved, precise, and studious" (he would later become a [[cardiologist]]) and George as "loud, sloppy, and boisterous".{{sfn|Coll|2005|p=355}} Because of his tendency to talk constantly he was known as "the mouthpiece". Sol Winder, a family friend and later owner of their diner, said he was "the type of guy who could never keep a secret".<ref name="NY Daily News">{{cite news|last1=E.|first1=Anne|last2=Kornblut|first2=James|last3=Rutenberg|first3=Jere|author4=Hester|title=A Hungry Kid May Lead CIA|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/hungry-kid-lead-cia-article-1.763910 |newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=New York |date=March 21, 1997 |accessdate=December 30, 2013 }}</ref> He was also interested in the news; the host of a local [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] host sent him an autograph in response to Tenet's letters, calling him "the future editorial page editor of ''[[The New York Times]]''{{-"}}.{{sfn|Coll|2005|p=355}} He played basketball and softball for his [[Greek Orthodox]] church, where he was also an [[altar server]].<ref name="NY Daily News" />

==Early career==
For his first job after graduating,{{sfn|Atkins|2011|p=403}} Tenet became research director of the [[American Hellenic Institute]] from 1978 to 1979 and worked for the [[Solar Energy Industries Association]] as Director of International Programs from then until 1982. He then began working for the [[United States Senate|Senate]], first as a legislative assistant and later as legislative director to then-Pennsylvania Senator [[H.&nbsp;John Heinz&nbsp;III]] from 1982 to 1985. He was a staff member of the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] (SSCI) from 1985 to 1988, then Staff Director of the SSCI from 1988 to 1993.{{sfn|SSCI|1997|p=8}} Later, Tenet joined President-elect [[Bill Clinton]]'s national security transition team in November 1992.<ref name="Diamond">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2002-10-09-tenet_x.htm|work=USA Today |title=CIA director's allies outrank his enemies |first=John |last=Diamond |date=October 14, 2002|access-date=May 3, 2010}}</ref> Clinton appointed Tenet Senior Director for Intelligence Programs at the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], where he served from 1993 to 1995.{{sfn|SSCI|1997|p=8}}

==CIA career==
Tenet was appointed [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director of Central Intelligence]] in July 1995. After [[John M. Deutch|John Deutch]]'s abrupt resignation in December 1996, Tenet served as acting director. This was followed by the reluctant withdrawal of [[Anthony Lake]], after it became apparent to Lake that his nomination had been successfully blocked by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]].{{sfn|Tenet|Harlow|2007|pp=6–8}} Tenet was then officially appointed Director on July 11, 1997, after a unanimous confirmation vote in the Senate. While the Director of Central Intelligence has been replaced by an incoming administration since [[Jimmy Carter]] replaced DCI [[George H.&nbsp;W. Bush]], Tenet served through the end of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] and well into the term of [[George W. Bush]]. In 1999 the Director declined to reveal the overall budget for intelligence operations (including the CIA) which was a departure from his release the previous two years. This led to criticism from government transparency advocates.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ackerman|first=Spencer|title=Washington's Five Worst Arguments for Keeping Secrets From You|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/06/government-secrecy/all/|newspaper=Wired|date=June 20, 2012|accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>

Tenet embarked on a mission to regenerate the CIA, which had fallen on hard times since the end of the [[Cold War]]. The number of agents recruited each year had fallen to an all-time low, a 25% decline from the [[Cold War]] peak. Tenet appealed to the original mission of the agency, which had been to "prevent another [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]". The trick was to see where danger might come from in the post-Cold War world. Tenet focused on potential problems such as "the transformation of Russia and China", "[[rogue state]]s" like North Korea, Iran and Iraq, and terrorism.{{sfn|Coll|2005|pp=317, 354, 359–62}}

===1999 bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade===
{{further|U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade}}
On May 7, 1999, during the [[Kosovo War]], U.S. bombers struck the [[Chinese embassy]] in [[Belgrade]], Serbia with five [[JDAM]] precision guided bombs, killing three Chinese reporters and injuring 20 others.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Peter|title=The tearful origins of China's stealth |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/MA29Ad01.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201052557/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/MA29Ad01.html |accessdate=January 27, 2014|newspaper=[[Asia Times Online]]|date=January 29, 2011|archive-date=February 1, 2011}}</ref> The United States claimed the attack was accidental. In testimony before a congressional committee, Tenet later admitted the strike was the only one in the campaign organized and directed by his agency, though he still claimed it was not deliberate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/1999/dci_speech_072299.html |title=DCI Statement on the Belgrade Chinese Embassy Bombing House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Open Hearing |accessdate=October 4, 2006 |last= Tenet |first= George |date=July 22, 1999|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/world/global/072399china-embassy.html |title=In a Fatal Error, C.I.A.

As a result of this and other incidents, systematic changes were made to pre-strike [[Rules of Engagement]] (ROE) for U.S. pilots, including checklists verifying target information and coordinates. China has never accepted the United States' version of events, although Tenet in a published work noted in a bit of black humor that in the prelude to the bombing of Iraq, China had, through unofficial channels, provided the Agency with the exact GPS coordinates of their Embassy in Baghdad so as to ensure the CIA knew the precise location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/ziliao/3602/3604/t18047.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031019051443/http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/ziliao/3602/3604/t18047.htm |archivedate=2003-10-19 |title=Strong Protest by the Chinese Government Against The Bombing by the US-led NATO of the Chinese Embassy in the Federal Yugoslavia |accessdate=October 22, 2009 |date=November 17, 2001|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China}}</ref>

===Al-Qaeda and the War on Terror===
By 1999 [[al-Qaeda]] had emerged as a significant terrorist threat. The [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 bombings of two U.S. African embassies]] were the latest in a string of attacks on American interests in the west Indian-Ocean region. And in 2000 the [[USS Cole bombing|USS Cole]] was bombed in [[Aden]] in an attempt to sink her, killing 17 naval personnel.

====Bin Laden Plan====
In 1999 Tenet put forward a grand "[[Bin Laden Issue Station#New leadership and the new Plan, 1999|Plan]]" for dealing with al-Qaeda. In preparation, he selected new leadership for the CIA's [[Counterterrorist Center]] (CTC). He placed [[Cofer Black]] in charge of the CTC, and Richard Blee (a "top-flight executive" from Tenet's own suite) in charge of the CTC's [[Bin Laden Issue Station|Bin Laden unit]]. Tenet assigned the CTC to develop the Plan. The proposals, brought out in September, sought to penetrate Qaeda's "Afghan sanctuary" with U.S. and Afghan agents, in order to obtain information on and mount operations against Bin Laden's network. In October, officers from the Bin Laden unit visited northern [[Afghanistan]]. Once the Plan was finalized, the Agency created a "Qaeda cell" (whose functions overlapped those of the CTC's [[Bin Laden Issue Station|Bin Laden unit]]) to give operational leadership to the effort.

The CIA concentrated its inadequate financial resources on the Plan, so that at least some of its more modest aspirations were realized. Intelligence collection efforts on bin Laden and al-Qaeda increased significantly from 1999. "By 9/11", said Tenet, "a map would show that these collection programs and human [reporting] networks were in place in such numbers as to nearly cover Afghanistan". (But this excluded Bin Laden's inner circle itself.){{sfn|Coll|2005|pp=436–37, 451–52, 455–56, 466–72, 485, 646 note 42, 654 note 7}}{{sfn|9/11 Commission|2004|pp=357, 142–43, 204}}<ref name="FAS">{{cite web|last=Tenet|first=George|title=Written Statement for the Record of the Director of Central Intelligence Before the Joint Inquiry Committee|url=https://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/101702tenet.html|work=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|date=October 17, 2002|accessdate=December 23, 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Tenet|Harlow|2007|pp=119–20}}

Contrary to the 2005 Inspector General's report, George Tenet had in fact reported the potential threat to then national security advisor [[Condoleezza Rice]] during an urgent meeting on July 10, 2001 in which his team informed her that "There will be significant terrorist attacks against the United States in the coming weeks or months."<ref name=politico>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Whipple |title=What the CIA knew before 9/11: New details |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/attacks-will-be-spectacular-cia-war-on-terror-bush-bin-laden/ |work=[[Politico]] |date=November 13, 2015 |accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref>

====Predator drone====
{{further|General Atomics MQ-1 Predator}}
The CIA also experimented with a small remote-controlled reconnaissance aircraft, the Predator, to try to spot Bin Laden in [[Afghanistan]]. A series of flights in autumn 2000, overseen by CTC officials and flown by USAF drone pilots from a control room at the CIA's Langley headquarters, produced probable sightings of the al-Qaeda leader.{{sfn|Coll|2005|pp=527, 532}}{{sfn|9/11 Commission|2004|pp=189–90}}

Black and others became advocates of arming the Predator with adapted [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]] anti-tank missiles to try to kill Bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders in [[targeted killing]]s. But there were both legal and technical issues. Tenet in particular was concerned about the CIA moving back into the business of targeted killing. And a series of live-fire tests in the [[Great Basin Desert]] in [[Nevada]] in summer 2001 produced mixed results.

Tenet advised cautiously on the matter at a meeting of the Cabinet-level Principals Committee on September 4, 2001. If the Cabinet wanted to empower the CIA to field a lethal drone, Tenet said, "they should do so with their eyes wide open, fully aware of the potential fallout if there were a controversial or mistaken strike". National Security Adviser [[Condoleezza Rice]] concluded that the armed Predator was required, but evidently not ready. It was agreed to recommend to the CIA to resume reconnaissance flights. The "previously reluctant" Tenet then ordered the Agency to do so. The CIA was authorized to "deploy the system with weapons-capable aircraft".{{sfn|Coll|2005|pp=580–81}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Tenet|first=George|title=Written Statement for the Record of the Director of Central Intelligence Before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|url=https://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing8/tenet_statement.pdf |date=March 24, 2004|pages=15, 16|accessdate=December 23, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Gellman">{{cite news|last=Gellman|first=Barton|title=A Strategy's Cautious Evolution|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060900885_pf.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 20, 2002}}</ref>{{sfn|9/11 Commission|2004|pp=210–14, 513}}

[[File:CIA Director George Tenet Listens to President Bush's Address in the President's Emergency Operations Center (PEOC).jpg|thumb|George Tenet on September 11, 2001]]
After the September 11 attacks, many observers criticized the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] for numerous "[[intelligence failure]]s" as one of the major reasons why the attacks were not prevented.<ref name="navy">{{cite journal |last1=Porch |first1=Douglas |last2=Wirtz |first2=James J. |title=Surprise and Intelligence Failure |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a485164.pdf |journal=[[Strategic Insights]] |date=September 2002 |volume=I |issue=7 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423110658/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA485164 |archivedate=April 23, 2013 |url-status=live |accessdate=December 23, 2013}}</ref>

Tenet testified before a public hearing of the [[9/11 Commission]] investigating 9/11, that he did not meet with Bush in August 2001, the month before the September 11 attacks. The same evening after the hearings, a CIA spokesman corrected Tenet's testimony, stating that Tenet did indeed meet with Bush twice in August.<ref>{{cite news|last=Powell|first=Stewart M.|title=CIA's Tenet did speak to Bush before 9-11, spokesman says|url=http://www.sltrib.com/2004/Apr/04162004/nation_w/157713.asp|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=April 16, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616224857/http://www.sltrib.com/2004/Apr/04162004/nation_w/157713.asp|archivedate=June 16, 2004|accessdate=February 5, 2010}}</ref> Tenet in his memoir writes of his memorable visit to Bush at Bush's ranch in [[Crawford, Texas|Crawford]], Texas, in August 2001.{{sfn|Tenet|Harlow|2007|pp=6–8}}

In August 2007, a report written by the [[CIA]] [[inspector general]] was made public (originally written in 2005 but kept classified). The 19-page summary states that Tenet knew the dangers of Al Qaeda well before September 2001, but that the leadership of the CIA did not do enough to prevent any attacks and that Tenet personally "bears ultimate responsibility" for the intelligence community's failure to develop a plan to counter al Qaeda.<ref name=bbc /> Tenet reacted to the publication of this report by calling it "flat wrong", citing in particular the planning efforts of the past two years.<ref name=bbc />

Tenet immediately increased the size and capability of the CIA's special operations component housed in the Special Operations Group of the [[Special Activities Division]]. This force had been allowed to diminish under the early Clinton administration. These Paramilitary Operations Officers were the first to enter both Afghanistan and Iraq. Once in these countries these officers organized and led the Northern Alliance against the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Kurds against Ansar Al-Islam and Saddam's forces in Iraq. The rebuilding of this capability and the successful employment of these elite commandos is considered one of Tenet's greatest achievements in the Global War on Terror.<ref>{{cite web|last=Woodward|first=Bob|authorlink=Bob Woodward|date=November 18, 2001|title=Secret CIA Units Playing a Central Combat Role|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/CIA18.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=Bob|authorlink=Bob Woodward|title=Bush at War|year=2003|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-0473-6|ref=harv|title-link=Bush at War}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=Bob|title=Plan of Attack|year=2004|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-5547-9|ref=harv|title-link=Plan of Attack}}</ref>

====Worldwide Attack Matrix====
{{main|Worldwide Attack Matrix}}
Tenet considered that [[Cofer Black#Al-Qaeda strategy, 1999–2001|his Al-Qaeda plan]] had placed the CIA in a better position to respond after the September 11 attacks. As he put it,

<blockquote>
How could [an intelligence] community without a strategic plan tell the president of the United States just four days after 9/11 how to attack the Afghan sanctuary and operate against [[al-Qaeda|al-Qa'ida]] in ninety-two countries around the world?{{sfn|Tenet|Harlow|2007|pp=121–22; cf. p. 178}}</blockquote>

This was at a meeting of the restricted [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]or "war council"—at [[Camp David]] on September 15, 2001. Tenet presented the [[Worldwide Attack Matrix]], a blueprint for what became known as the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]].<ref name="navy" /> He proposed firstly to send CIA teams into Afghanistan to collect intelligence on, and mount covert operations against, al-Qaeda and the [[Taliban]].

During Tenet's directorship, President Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding and other forms of torture ([[euphemism|euphemistically]] referred to as "Enhanced Interrogation Techniques") during interrogations of [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], [[Abu Zubaydah]] and [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]], all suspected Al Qaida members.<ref>{{cite news |title=CIA admit 'waterboarding' al-Qaida suspects|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=February 29, 2008 |date=February 8, 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/05/india.terrorism |location=London |first=Mark |last=Tran }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Brian |last2=Esposito |first2=Richard |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Investigation/story?id=1322866 |title=CIA's Harsh Interrogation Techniques Described |newspaper=[[ABC news]]|date=November 18, 2005}}</ref>

===Iraq WMD controversy===
{{further|Iraq and weapons of mass destruction}}
According to a report by veteran [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] [[Bob Woodward]] in his book ''[[Plan of Attack]]'', Tenet privately lent his personal authority to the intelligence reports about [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) in [[Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Goldberg |authorlink=Jeffrey Goldberg |title=Woodward vs. Tenet: The New Intelligence War |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/05/21/woodward-vs-tenet |date=May 21, 2007 |accessdate=February 6, 2008 }}</ref> At a meeting on December 12, 2002, he assured Bush that the evidence that Iraq had WMDs amounted to a "[[slam dunk]] case." After several months of refusing to confirm this statement, Tenet stated that it was taken out of context. He indicated that it was made pursuant to a discussion about how to convince the American people to support invading Iraq.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Scott |last1=Shane |authorlink=Scott Shane |first2=Mark |last2=Mazzetti |authorlink2=Mark Mazzetti |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/27/washington/27intel.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Ex-C.I.A. Chief, in Book, Assails Cheney on Iraq|date=April 27, 2007|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref> The search following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by US, British and international forces yielded no significant WMDs.

In September 2002, the Senate Intelligence Committee met with Tenet in a closed-door session. Sen. [[Bob Graham]] requested a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq. Tenet responded by saying "We've never done a National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq" and resisted the request to provide one to Congress. Graham insisted "This is the most important decision that we as members of Congress and that the people of America are likely to make in the foreseeable future. We want to have the best understanding of what it is we're about to get involved with." Tenet refused to do a report on the military or occupation phase, but reluctantly agreed to do a NIE on the weapons of mass destruction. Graham described the Senate Intelligence Committee meeting with Tenet as "the turning point in our attitude towards Tenet and our understanding of how the intelligence community has become so submissive to the desires of the administration. The administration wasn't using intelligence to inform their judgment; they were using intelligence as part of a public relations campaign to justify their judgment."<ref>{{cite interview|last=Graham|first=Bob|subject-link=Bob Graham |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/darkside/interviews/graham.html |title=Interview: Sen. Bob Graham|work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]|publisher=[[PBS]]|date=January 31, 2006}}</ref>

Congress voted to support the Iraq war based on the NIE Tenet provided in October 2002. However, the bipartisan "Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Prewar Intelligence" released on July 7, 2004, concluded that the key findings in the 2002 NIE either overstated, or were not supported by, the actual intelligence. The Senate report also found the US Intelligence Community to suffer from a "broken corporate culture and poor management" that resulted in a NIE which was completely wrong in almost every respect.<ref>{{cite web|author=United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB129/intro_part1.pdf |title=United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|date=July 7, 2004|author-link=United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence}}</ref>

===Resignation===
Citing "personal reasons," Tenet submitted his resignation to President Bush on June 3, 2004. Tenet said his resignation "was a personal decision and had only one basis—in fact, the well-being of my wonderful family—nothing more and nothing less."<ref name="Malveaux">{{cite news|last1=Malveaux|first1=Suzanne|last2=Barrett|first2=Ted|last3=Schuster|first3=Henry|title=Tenet: Resigning with head 'very, very high'|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/03/tenet.resigns/ |accessdate=December 26, 2013|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=June 4, 2004}}</ref> He officially left on July 11, exactly seven years after being appointed by Clinton.<ref name="Warner">{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Margaret|title=CIA Director George Tenet's Resignation|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/government_programs/jan-june04/tenet_6-3.html|accessdate=December 25, 2013|newspaper=[[PBS NewsHour]]|date=June 3, 2004|authorlink=Margaret Warner}}</ref> Former DCI [[Stansfield Turner]] said, "I think the president feels he's in enough trouble that he's got to begin to cast some of the blame for the morass that we are in <!-- not a mistake-->in Iraq on to somebody else and this was one subtle way to do it."<ref name="Resignation quotes">{{cite news|title=Quotes on Tenet's Resignation|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB108628380494728009|accessdate=December 25, 2013|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=June 3, 2004}}</ref> However, Bush voiced support for Tenet's efforts, stating, "I'm sorry he's leaving. He's done a superb job on behalf of the American people."<ref name="Warner" /> 

[[James Pavitt]], his [[Director of the National Clandestine Service|Deputy Director for Operations]] at the CIA, announced his resignation the following day. That led to speculation that the exit of both senior intelligence officials was related to the controversy over the September 11 attacks, alleged Iraqi WMDs, and the decision to go to war with Iraq.<ref name="Malveaux" /> After Tenet left, [[John E.

[[File:Tenet bush presidental medal of freedom.png|thumb|right|[[George W. Bush|President Bush]] awarding the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] to Tenet on December 14, 2004]]
On December 14, 2004, President George W. Bush awarded Tenet the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], along with [[Tommy Franks]] and [[Paul Bremer]]. Bush said that Tenet "was one of the first to recognize and address the growing threat to America from radical terrorist networks." However, Bush's decision was met with some criticism: Democratic Senator [[Carl Levin]] said, "I don't think [he] served the president or the nation well."<ref name="WH Medal of Freedom">{{cite press release|last=Bush|first=George W.|authorlink=George W.

Tenet spent three years as Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy and Senior Research Associate in the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at his former university the Georgetown School of Foreign service. His official teaching began in the Fall term, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=George Tenet to join the School of Foreign Service|url=https://georgetownvoice.com/2004/10/21/george-tenet-to-join-the-school-of-foreign-service/ |website=[[The Georgetown Voice]] |accessdate=January 3, 2017|date=October 21, 2004}}</ref>

In October 2006, Tenet joined British defense contractor [[Qinetiq]] as an independent non-executive director. Chairman [[John Chisholm (executive)|John Chisholm]] noted Tenet's "extraordinary track record and experience in the fields of intelligence and security."<ref>{{cite news|last=Brodie|first=Sophie|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2949594/US-spymaster-joins-QinetiQ.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=US spymaster joins QinetiQ|date=October 25, 2006|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}</ref> He stepped down from the board in October 2007 (his old position was taken by retired [[U.S. Navy]] Admiral [[Edmund Giambastiani]])<ref name="Waterman">{{cite news|last=Waterman|first=Shaun|title=Tenet gets job at secretive N.Y. bank|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2008/02/18/Tenet-gets-job-at-secretive-NY-bank/64181203344822/?ur3=1 |agency=[[United Press International]]|date=February 18, 2008|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}</ref> as well as the board of [[forensic software]] company [[Guidance Software]] in November.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tenet|first=George|title=Letter of Resignation |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1375557/000119312507258057/dex991.htm|publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]|accessdate=February 11, 2014|date=November 30, 2007}}</ref> He joined Qinetiq's North America board as well as becoming managing director of investment bank [[Allen & Company]].

He also famously received a shout out in [[Kanye West]]'s song "[[Clique (song)|Clique]]" where he claimed to have once met Tenet and had a conversation about their identical [[Maybach]] vehicles, although West speculated that Tenet had leased his instead of buying it outright. Tenet's spokesman confirmed that the meeting had taken place, but that Maybachs had not been a topic of the conversation.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2012/09/kanye-west-george-tenet/ |title=Kanye West Really Did Meet With Ex-CIA Director |first=Spencer |last=Ackerman |date=September 20, 2012 |journal=Wired |accessdate=March 28, 2018}}</ref>

===Memoir===
{{Main|At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA}}

In April 2007, Tenet released his [[memoir]] titled ''[[At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA]]'' which was written with [[Bill Harlow]]. He appeared on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' on April 29, 2007, offering much criticism of the Bush administration. The book was the top-selling book in sales in the first week after publication.

''The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of its Enemies since 9/11'' (2006) by Ron Suskind claims that [[Abu Zubaydah]], once said to be al-Qaida chief of operations, was a low-level functionary and mentally ill.<ref name="WaPo">{{cite news|last=Gellman|first=Barton|authorlink=Barton Gellman|title=The Shadow War, In a Surprising New Light |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/19/AR2006061901211_pf.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 20, 2006}}</ref> In his memoirs, Tenet commented as follows:{{sfn|Tenet|Harlow|2007|p=243}}

{{quote|A published report in 2006 contended that Abu Zubaydah was mentally unstable and that the administration had overstated his importance. Baloney. Abu Zubaydah had been at the crossroads of many al-Qa'ida operations and was in position to—and did—share critical information with his interrogators. Apparently, the source of the rumor that Abu Zubaydah was unbalanced was his personal diary, in which he adopted various personas. From that shaky perch, some junior Freudians leapt to the conclusion that Zubaydah had multiple personalities. In fact, Agency psychiatrists eventually determined that in his diary he was using a sophisticated literary device to express himself. And, boy, did he express himself.}}

Critics pointed out a factual error in Tenet's book. On the book's first page, Tenet tells of a conversation with then-[[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] advisor [[Richard Perle]] on September 12, 2001, in which Tenet claims Perle told him in person that "Iraq had to pay for the attack". But the conversation could not have occurred on that day, because Perle was stranded in Paris, France, on September 12 and did not return to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] until three days later. Perle later stated that the two men indeed crossed each other one morning, as claimed by Tenet, but only later in the same week and not on September 12. But Perle insisted that he and Tenet exchanged no words in that encounter.<ref>{{cite news |authorlink=William Kristol |last=Kristol |first=William |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/george-tenets-imaginary-encounter |title=George Tenet's Imaginary Encounter...|date=April 4, 2007|newspaper=[[The Weekly Standard]]|accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Shrader|first=Katherine|title=Tenet Memoir Draws Heat From Key Players|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/29/AR2007042900605_2.html|accessdate=July 28, 2009|date=April 30, 2007|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>
