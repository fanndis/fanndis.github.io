'''Sumatra''' is one of the [[Sunda Islands]] of western [[Indonesia]]. It is the largest island that is fully within Indonesian territory, as well as the [[list of islands by area|sixth-largest island]] in the world at 473,481&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (182,812&nbsp;mi.<sup>2</sup>), not including adjacent islands such as the [[Simeulue Island|Simeulue]], [[Nias Island|Nias]], [[Mentawai Islands|Mentawai]], [[Enggano Island|Enggano]], [[Riau Islands]], [[Bangka Belitung]] and [[Krakatoa archipelago]].

Sumatra is an elongated landmass spanning a diagonal northwest–southeast axis. The [[Indian Ocean]] borders the west, northwest, and southwest coasts of Sumatra, with the island chain of [[Simeulue]], [[Nias]], [[Mentawai Islands|Mentawai]], and [[Enggano]] off the western coast. In the northeast, the narrow [[Strait of Malacca]] separates the island from the [[Malay Peninsula]], which is an extension of the Eurasian continent. In the southeast, the narrow [[Sunda Strait]], containing the [[Krakatoa Archipelago]], separates Sumatra from [[Java]]. The northern tip of Sumatra borders the [[Andaman Islands]], while off the southeastern coast lie the islands of Bangka and Belitung, [[Karimata Strait]] and the [[Java Sea]]. The [[Bukit Barisan]] mountains, which contain several active volcanoes, form the backbone of the island, while the northeastern area contains large plains and lowlands with swamps, mangrove forest and complex river systems. The [[equator]] crosses the island at its centre in [[West Sumatra]] and [[Riau]] provinces. The climate of the island is [[tropical]], hot, and humid. Lush [[tropical rain forest]] once dominated the landscape.

Sumatra has a wide range of plant and animal species but has lost almost 50% of its tropical rainforest in the last 35 years.{{Clarify|of when otherwise time reference easily obsolete|date=March 2018}} Many species are now [[critically endangered]], such as the [[Sumatran ground cuckoo]], the [[Sumatran tiger]], the [[Sumatran elephant]], the [[Sumatran rhinoceros]], and the [[Sumatran orangutan]]. [[Deforestation]] on the island has also resulted in serious seasonal smoke haze over neighbouring countries, such as the [[2013 Southeast Asian haze]] which caused considerable tensions between Indonesia and  affected countries [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Shadbolt |first=Peter |date=21 June 2013 |title=Singapore Chokes on Haze as Sumatran Forest Fires Rage |work=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/19/world/asia/singapore-haze/index.html |url-status=live |access-date=7 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107033133/http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/19/world/asia/singapore-haze/index.html |archive-date=7 November 2017}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Sumatra was known in ancient times by the [[Sanskrit]] names of ''Suwarnadwīpa'' ("Island of Gold") and ''Suwarnabhūmi'' ("Land of Gold"), because of the gold deposits in the island's [[highland (geography)|highlands]].<ref>{{cite book|title=A Kingdom of Words: Language and Power in Sumatra|last=Drakard|first=Jane|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=983-56-0035-X}}</ref> The earliest known mention of the current form “Sumatra” was in 1017, when the [[Srivijaya|local]] king [[Haji Sumatrabhumi]] ("King of the land of Sumatra")<ref>{{Cite book|last=Munoz|first=Paul Michel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqwuAQAAIAAJ&q=+Sumatrabhumi|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|date=2006|publisher=Continental Sales, Incorporated|isbn=978-981-4155-67-0|language=en}}</ref> sent an envoy to [[China]]. [[Arab]] geographers referred to the island as ''Lamri'' ([[Lamuri]], Lambri or Ramni) in the tenth through thirteenth centuries, in reference to a kingdom near modern-day [[Banda Aceh]] which was the first landfall for traders. The island has also been known by other names, including Andalas<ref>{{Cite book |last=Marsden |first=William |title=The History of Sumatra |publisher=Longman |year=1783 |location=Dutch |pages=5}}</ref> or Percha Island.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Historical Atlas of Indonesia| last=Cribb| first=Robert| publisher=Routledge| year=2013| pages=249}}</ref>

In the late 13th century century, [[Marco Polo]] referred to the kingdom as “Samara”, while his contemporary fellow Italian traveller [[Odoric of Pordenone]] used the form “Sumoltra”. Later in the 14th century the local form “Sumatra” became popular abroad due to the rising power of the kingdom of [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Samudera Pasai]] and the subsequent [[Aceh Sultanate|Sultanate of Aceh]].<ref name=sneddon>{{Cite book| last = Sneddon| first = James N.| title = The Indonesian language: its history and role in modern society| publisher = UNSW Press| year = 2003| page = 65| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=A9UjLYD9jVEC&pg=PA65| isbn = 9780868405988| access-date = 16 December 2015| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160529081804/https://books.google.com/books?id=A9UjLYD9jVEC&pg=PA65| archive-date = 29 May 2016| url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Macdonell |first=Arthur Anthony |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=laIPgMQF_XsC&pg=PA347 |title=A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary with Transliteration, Accentuation, and Etymological Analysis |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publications |year=1924 |isbn=9788120820005 |page=347 |access-date=16 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506234650/https://books.google.com/books?id=laIPgMQF_XsC&pg=PA347&lpg=PA347 |archive-date=6 May 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Batak Warriors 60011135 edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] warriors, 1870]]

By the year [[692]], the [[Melayu Kingdom]] was absorbed by [[Srivijaya]].<ref name="Coedes">{{Cite book |last=Coedès |first=George |title=The Indianized States of Southeast Asia |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=1968 |isbn=978-0-8248-0368-1 |editor-last=Vella |editor-first=Walter F. |translator-last=Cowing |translator-first=Susan Brown |author-link=George Coedès}}</ref>{{rp|79–80}}

[[Srivijaya]]n influence waned in the 11th century after it was defeated by the [[Chola]] Empire of southern India. At the same time, Islam made its way to Sumatra through [[Arabs]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] traders in the 6th and 7th centuries AD.<ref>G.R. Tibbets,''Pre-Islamic Arabia and South East Asia,'' in D.S. Richards (ed.),1970, ''Islam and The Trade of Asia'', Oxford: Bruno Cassirer Pub.

Richards (ed.),1970, p.129 n.42</ref> By the late 13th century, the monarch of the [[Pasai|Samudra]] kingdom had converted to Islam. [[Marco Polo]] visited the island in 1292, and his fellow Italian [[Odoric of Pordenone]] in 1321.

[[Morocco|Moroccan]] scholar [[Ibn Battuta]] visited with the sultan for 15 days, noting the city of Samudra was "a fine, big city with wooden walls and towers", and another two months on his return journey.<ref name=Ibn>{{cite book | last1=Battutah| first1=Ibn| title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah |date=2002 |publisher=Picador |location=London |isbn=9780330418799 |pages=256, 274, 322}}</ref> Samudra was succeeded by the powerful [[Aceh Sultanate]], which survived to the 20th century. With the coming of the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], the many Sumatran princely states gradually fell under their control. Aceh, in the north, was the major obstacle, as the Dutch were involved in the long and costly [[Aceh War]] (1873–1903).

The [[Free Aceh Movement]] fought against Indonesian government forces in the [[Insurgency in Aceh|Aceh Insurgency]] from 1976 to 2005.<ref>{{Cite news |date=17 July 2005 |title=Indonesia Agrees Aceh Peace Deal |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4690293.stm |url-status=live |access-date=17 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309110911/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4690293.stm |archive-date=9 March 2008}}</ref> Security crackdowns in 2001 and 2002 resulted in several thousand civilian deaths.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://hrw.org/reports/2003/indonesia1203/5.htm| title=Aceh Under Martial Law: Inside the Secret War: Human Rights and Humanitarian Law Violations| publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]| access-date=17 May 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306210847/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/indonesia1203/5.htm| archive-date=6 March 2016| url-status=live}}</ref>

The island was heavily impacted by both the 1883 [[Krakatoa|Krakatoa eruption]] and the 2004 [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Boxing Day Tsunami]].

===Languages===
[[File:WIKITONGUES- T.A., Iqbal, and Kalam speaking Acehnese.webm|thumb|Speakers of Acehnese.]]
There are over 52 [[Languages of Indonesia|languages]] spoken, all of which (except Chinese and Tamil) belong to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. Within Malayo-Polynesian, they are divided into several sub-branches: [[Chamic languages|Chamic]] (which are represented by [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] in which its closest relatives are languages spoken by [[Cham people|Ethnic Chams]] in Cambodia and Vietnam), [[Malayic languages|Malayic]] ([[Malay language|Malay]], [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]] and other closely related languages), [[Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands languages|Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands]] ([[Batak languages]], [[Gayo language|Gayo]] and others), [[Lampung language|Lampungic]] (includes Proper Lampung and [[Komering language|Komering]]) and [[Bornean languages|Bornean]] (represented by [[Rejangese language|Rejang]] in which its closest linguistic relatives are [[Bukar Sadong language|Bukar Sadong]] and [[Land Dayak languages|Land Dayak]] spoken in [[West Kalimantan]] and [[Sarawak]] ([[Malaysia]])). Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands and Lampungic branches are endemic to the island. Like all parts of Indonesia, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] (which was based on Riau Malay) is the official language and the main lingua franca. Although Sumatra has its own local lingua franca, [[Malayan languages|variants of Malay]] like Medan Malay and [[Musi language|Palembang Malay]]<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lFW1BwAAQBAJ&q=palembang+malay+lingua+franca&pg=PA675 |title=Atlas of Languages of Intercultural Communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas: Vol. I: Maps.

== Geography ==
[[File:Sumatra Volcanoes.png|thumb|Map of geological formation of Sumatra island]]
[[File:Sinabung.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Sinabung]], North Sumatra]]

The longest axis of the island runs approximately {{convert|1790|km|abbr=on}} northwest–southeast, crossing the equator near the centre. At its widest point, the island spans {{convert|435|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The interior of the island is dominated by two geographical regions: the [[Barisan Mountains]] in the west and swampy plains in the east. Sumatra is the closest Indonesian island to mainland Asia.

To the southeast is [[Java]], separated by the [[Sunda Strait]]. To the north is the [[Malay Peninsula]] (located on the Asian mainland), separated by the [[Strait of Malacca]]. To the east is [[Borneo]], across the [[Karimata Strait]]. West of the island is the [[Indian Ocean]].

The [[Great Sumatran fault]] (a [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip]] fault), and the [[Sunda megathrust]] (a [[subduction zone]]), run the entire length of the island along its west coast. On 26 December 2004, the western coast and islands of Sumatra, particularly [[Aceh]] province, were struck by a [[tsunami]] following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Indian Ocean earthquake]]. This was the longest earthquake recorded, lasting between 500 and 600 seconds.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Guinness Book of World Records 2014| last=Glenday| first=Craig| publisher=The Jim Pattison Group| year=2013| isbn=978-1-908843-15-9| pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/015 015]| url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/015}}</ref> More than 170,000 Indonesians were killed, primarily in Aceh. Other recent earthquakes to strike Sumatra include the [[2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake]] and the [[2010 Mentawai earthquake and tsunami]].

[[Lake Toba]] is the site of a [[Supervolcano|supervolcanic]] [[types of volcanic eruptions|eruption]] that occurred around 74,000 years ago, representing a climate-changing event.<ref>Vogel, Gretchen, [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/how-ancient-humans-survived-global-volcanic-winter-massive-eruption?et_rid=382659176&et_cid=1903121 How ancient humans survived global ‘volcanic winter’ from massive eruption], Science, 12 March 2018</ref>

To the east, big rivers carry silt from the mountains, forming the vast lowland interspersed by swamps. Even if mostly unsuitable for farming, the area is currently of great economic importance for Indonesia. It produces oil from both above and below the soil – [[Oil palm|palm oil]] and [[petroleum]].

Sumatra is the largest producer of [[Indonesian coffee]]. Small-holders grow Arabica coffee (''[[Coffea arabica]]'') in the highlands, while Robusta (''[[Coffea canephora]]'') is found in the lowlands. Arabica coffee from the regions of Gayo, Lintong and Sidikilang is typically processed using the [[Giling Basah]] (wet hulling) technique, which gives it a heavy body and low acidity.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Daerah Produsen Kopi Arabika di Indonesia |url=http://kopidistributor.com/sekilas-info/daerah-produsen-kopi-arabika-di-indonesia |date=28 February 2015 |website=Kopi Distributor 1995 |trans-title=Regional Arabica Coffee Producers in Indonesia |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402094956/http://kopidistributor.com/sekilas-info/daerah-produsen-kopi-arabika-di-indonesia |archive-date=2 April 2015 |access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref>

Sumatra supports a wide range of vegetation types which are home to a rich variety of species, including 17 endemic genera of plants.<ref name="Whitten1999">{{Cite book |last=Whitten |first=Tony |title=The Ecology of Sumatra |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |year=1999 |isbn=962-593-074-4}}</ref> Unique species include the [[Sumatran pine]] which dominates the [[Sumatran tropical pine forests]] of the higher mountainsides in the north of the island and rainforest plants such as ''[[Rafflesia arnoldii]]'' (the world's largest individual flower), and the [[titan arum]] (the world's largest unbranched [[inflorescence]]).

The island is home to 201 mammal species and 580 bird species, such as the [[Sumatran ground cuckoo]]. There are nine endemic mammal species on mainland Sumatra and 14 more endemic to the nearby [[Mentawai Islands]].<ref name="Whitten1999" /> There are about 300 freshwater fish species in Sumatra.<ref>Nguyen, T. T. T., and S. S. De Silva (2006). "Freshwater finfish biodiversity and conservation: an asian perspective". ''Biodiversity & Conservation'' 15(11): 3543–3568</ref> There are 93 [[List of amphibians of Sumatra|amphibian species]] in Sumatra, 21 of which are endemic to Sumatra.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hellen Kurniati |url=http://www.rufford.org/rsg/projects/hellen_kurniati |website=The Rufford Foundation |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825105258/http://www.rufford.org/rsg/projects/hellen_kurniati |archive-date=25 August 2017 |access-date=25 August 2017}}</ref> (''See also: [[List of amphibians of Sumatra]]'')

The [[Sumatran tiger]], [[Sumatran rhinoceros]], [[Sumatran elephant]], [[Sumatran ground cuckoo]], and [[Sumatran orangutan]] are all critically endangered, indicating the highest level of threat to their survival. In October 2008, the Indonesian government announced a plan to protect Sumatra's remaining forests.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Forest, Wildlife Protection Pledged at World Conservation Congress |url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/oct2008/2008-10-14-01.asp |date=14 October 2008 |website=Environment News Service |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603162220/http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/oct2008/2008-10-14-01.asp |archive-date=3 June 2012 |access-date=25 July 2012}}</ref>

The island includes more than 10 national parks, including three which are listed as the [[Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra]] [[World Heritage Site]] – [[Gunung Leuser National Park]], [[Kerinci Seblat National Park]] and [[Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park]]. The [[Berbak National Park]] is one of three national parks in Indonesia listed as a [[wetland]] of international importance under the [[Ramsar Convention]].

==Rail transport==
Several unconnected railway networks built during [[Netherlands East Indies]] exist in Sumatra, such as the ones connecting [[Banda Aceh]]-[[Lhokseumawe]]-[[Besitang]]-[[Medan]]-Tebingtinggi-[[Pematang Siantar]]-Rantau Prapat in Northern Sumatra (the Banda Aceh-Besitang section was closed in 1971, but is currently being rebuilt).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Younger|first1=Scott|title=The Slow Train|url=http://thejakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/archive/the-slow-train/476582/|access-date=19 July 2015|work=Jakarta Globe|date=6 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721210204/http://thejakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/archive/the-slow-train/476582/|archive-date=21 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]]-[[Solok]]-[[Bukittinggi]] in [[West Sumatra]], and [[Bandar Lampung]]-[[Palembang]]-Lahat-Lubuk Linggau in Southern Sumatra.
