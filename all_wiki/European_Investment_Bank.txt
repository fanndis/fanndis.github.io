{{Politics of the European Union mini}}
The '''European Investment Bank''' ('''EIB''') is a publicly owned [[International financial institutions|international financial institution]] whose shareholders are the [[member states of the European Union|EU member states]]. It was established in 1958 under the [[Treaty of Rome]] as a "policy-driven bank" using financing operations to further EU policy goals <ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.eib.org/infocentre/publications/all/operational-plan-2012-2014.htm|title=EIB Operational Plan 2012–2014|website=eib.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105042219/http://www.eib.org/infocentre/publications/all/operational-plan-2012-2014.htm|archivedate=5 January 2013}}</ref> such as [[European integration]] and [[social cohesion]].<ref>{{cite web|last=European Investment Bank|title=What Is the EIB?|url=http://www.eib.org/infocentre/faq/index.htm#what-is-the-eib|work=FAQ – Structure and Organisation}}</ref> It should not be confused with the [[European Central Bank]], which is based in [[Frankfurt]] (Germany) or with the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD) which is based in [[London]] (United Kingdom).

==History==
The European Investment Bank was founded when the [[Treaty of Rome]] came into force 1958, located in [[Brussels]] and with 66 employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eib.org/about/key_figures/index.htm|title=Some Dates and Figures|publisher=European Investment Bank}}</ref> In 1968 it was relocated to [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]], where it remains. By 1999, it had more than 1,000 staff members, and more than 2,000 in 2012.

The EIB Group was formed in 2000, comprising the EIB and the [[European Investment Fund]] (EIF), the EU's [[venture capital]] arm that provides finances and guarantees for [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|small and medium enterprises]] (SMEs). The EIB is the EIF's majority shareholder, with 62% of the shares.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who are the owners of the EIB Group?|url=http://www.eib.org/infocentre/faq/index.htm#who-are-the-owners-of-the-eib-group|work=FAQ – Structure and Organisation|publisher=European Investment Bank}}</ref> In 2012, the EIB Institute was created, with the goal of promoting "European initiatives for the common good" in EU Member States and candidate and potential candidate countries, as well as [[EFTA]] nations.

The total subscribed capital of the Bank was EUR 232&nbsp;billion in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eib.org/about/key_figures/index.htm |title=EIB Group: key statutory figures |publisher=Eib.org |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref> The capital of the EIB was virtually doubled between 2007 and 2009 in response to the financial crisis. The EU heads of government agreed to increase paid-in capital by EUR 10&nbsp;billion in June 2012, with implementation expected in early 2013.

For the fiscal year 2011, EIB lent EUR 61&nbsp;billion in various loan products, bringing total outstanding loans to EUR 395&nbsp;billion; one-third higher than at the end of 2008. Nearly 90% of these were with EU member states with the remainder dispersed between around 150 "partner countries" (in southern and eastern Europe, the Mediterranean region, Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Pacific). The bank uses its AAA [[credit rating]] to fund itself by raising equivalent amounts on the capital markets.

==Mission==
The Bank's mission is to fund infrastructure projects in Europe. The bank favors [[Public-private partnership]] funding models.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Shaoul|first1=Jean|last2=Stafford|first2=Anne|last3=Stapleton|first3=Pamela|date=2007|title=Partnerships and the role of financial advisors: private control over public policy?|journal=Policy & Politics|volume=35|issue=3|pages=479–495|language=en|doi=10.1332/030557307781571678}}</ref>

Although about 90 percent of projects financed by the EIB are based in EU member countries, the bank does fund projects in about 150 other countries—non-EU [[Southeastern European]] countries, Mediterranean partner countries, [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|ACP countries]], Asian and Latin American countries, the members of the [[Eastern Partnership#Financing|Eastern Partnership]] and Russia.<ref>{{cite web|title=In which countries is the EIB active?|url=http://www.eib.org/infocentre/faq/index.htm#in-which-countries-is-the-eib-active|work=FAQ – Activities|publisher=European Investment Bank}}</ref> According to the EIB, it works in these countries to implement the financial pillar of the union's external cooperation and development policies by encouraging private sector development, infrastructure development, security of energy supply and environmental sustainability. EU finance ministers have "called on all multilateral development banks, such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[Asian Development Bank]], to phase out financing of fossil fuel projects."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/11/15/european-investment-bank-ends-lending-fossil-fuel-projects/|title=European Investment Bank ends lending to fossil fuel projects|last=Farand|first=Chloé|date=2019-11-15|website=Climate Home News|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>

In the wake of the [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], the Council of the European Union instructed the EIB to suspend new financing operations in Russia.<ref name="FAC conclusions 16 07">{{cite web|url= http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/143990.pdf|archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140717005907/http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/143990.pdf|url-status= dead|archive-date= 17 July 2014|title= European Council conclusions on external relations (Ukraine and Gaza)|author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 16 July 2014|website= consilium.europa.eu/|publisher= Council of the European Union|accessdate= 26 July 2014}}</ref>

==Strategy==
<big>'''Operating strategy'''</big>

* To finance viable capital projects that further EU objectives
* To borrow on the capital markets to finance these projects

<big>'''Lending strategy within the EU'''</big>

Within the EU the EIB has six priority objectives:
* Cohesion and convergence (regional policy)
* Support for small and medium-sized enterprises
* Environmental sustainability
* Knowledge economy
* Development of Trans-European Networks of transport and energy
* Sustainable, competitive, and secure energy supply

<big>'''Lending strategy outside the EU'''</big>

Outside the EU the EIB's priority objectives for lending activity are:
* Private sector development
* [[Financial sector development]]
* Infrastructure development
* Security of energy supply
* Environmental sustainability
* EU presence

When making loans outside the EU, the bank has lending mandates based on EU external cooperation and development policies, which differ from region to region.

# ''Pre-Accession'': Candidate and Potential Candidate countries in the Enlargement region (states which could possibly join the EU)
# ''European Neighbourhood'': Mediterranean Neighbourhood / Russia and Eastern Neighbours
# ''Development'': Africa, Pacific and Caribbean (ACP) / Republic of South Africa
# ''Economic Cooperation'': Asia and Latin America (ALA)

Within pre-accession countries, activities support both the EU priority lending objectives ''and'' the objectives of the external mandates.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

==Corporate policies==
Transport Policy (renewed in 2011), Energy Policy (2012), Transparency Policy (latest renewal in 2015), Climate Strategy (2015), Governance at the EIB, Complaints Mechanism Policy (renewed in 2010), Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Policy, Integrity Policy and Compliance Charter, Statement on Environmental and Social Principles and Standards, EIB Whistleblowing Policy, EIB Policy towards weakly regulated, non-transparent and uncooperative jurisdictions.
As such, the European Investment Bank is currently represented in the Standard Committee of SuRe® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure, which is a global voluntary standard, developed by the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] and the French bank [[Natixis]], which integrates key criteria of sustainability and resilience into infrastructure development and upgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gib-foundation.org/standard-committee/|title=SuRe® Standard Committee - Global Infrastructure Basel|website=www.gib-foundation.org}}</ref>
