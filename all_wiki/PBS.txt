PBS is funded by a combination of [[List of PBS member stations|member station]] dues, the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], [[National Datacast]], [[pledge drive]]s, and donations from both [[Private foundation (United States)|private foundations]] and individual citizens. All proposed funding for programming is subject to a set of standards to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source.<ref>{{cite web|title=PBS Funding Standards|url=https://www.pbs.org/about/producing-pbs/funding/|url-status=live|access-date=May 19, 2018|website=PBS|quote=Public television is a major participant in the great tradition of a free and independent American press. To protect public television's journalistic integrity, PBS's funding standards are premised on core principles that ensure the complete editorial independence of producers from influence by underwriters.

==History==
[[File:2100 Crystal Dr, Arlington, VA April 2019.jpg|thumb|PBS headquarters in [[Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia]]]]

PBS was established on November 3, 1969 by [[Hartford N. Gunn Jr.]] (president of [[WGBH Educational Foundation|WGBH]]), [[John Macy]] (president of [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting|CPB]]), [[James Day (journalist)|James Day]] (last president of [[National Educational Television]]), and Kenneth A. Christiansen (chairman of the department of broadcasting at the [[University of Florida]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Public Broadcasting PolicyBase|date=January 14, 2000|title=Articles of Incorporation of Public Broadcasting Service|url=http://www.current.org/pbpb/documents/PBSarticles69.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010406090018/http://www.current.org/pbpb/documents/PBSarticles69.html|archive-date=April 6, 2001|access-date=January 12, 2008|work=[[Current (newspaper)|Current]]}}</ref> 

It began operations on October 5, 1970, taking over many of the functions of its predecessor, [[National Educational Television]] (NET), which later merged with [[Newark, New Jersey]] station WNDT to form [[WNET]]. In 1973, it merged with [[Educational Television Stations]].<ref name="JARVIK">{{cite book|title=PBS, behind the screen|author=Laurence Ariel Jarvik|publisher=Forum|location=[[Rocklin, California]]|year=1997|isbn=0761506683}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Public TV Faces Fund Struggles|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SelHAAAAIBAJ&pg=805,469633&dq=hartford+public+broadcasting+television+gunn&hl=en|newspaper=[[Record-Journal|The Morning Record]]|via=[[Google News]]|access-date=October 28, 2013|archive-date=September 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906010404/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SelHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=n_8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=805,469633&dq=hartford+public+broadcasting+television+gunn&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Vanishing Vision: The Inside Story of Public Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKYZynRiU6YC&q=hartford+n+gunn+jr&pg=PA137|author=James Day|via=[[Google Books]]|date=September 16, 1969|access-date=October 23, 2013|isbn = 9780520086593}}</ref>

Immediately after public disclosure of the [[Watergate scandal]], on May 17, 1973, the [[United States Senate Watergate Committee]] commenced proceedings; PBS broadcast the proceedings nationwide, with [[Robert MacNeil]] and [[Jim Lehrer]] as commentators. For seven months, nightly "gavel-to-gavel" broadcasts drew great public interest, and raised the profile of the fledgling PBS network.<ref>[https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/watergate/watergate-and-public-broadcasting "'Gavel-to-Gavel': The Watergate Scandal and Public Television", ''American Archive of Public Broadcasting''.

In 2019, PBS announced plans to move its headquarters to a new building in Crystal City, Virginia. PBS is asking the Arlington County Board for permission to add its logo to the top of its new headquarters, which has a 40-year-old restriction placed on it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sign Proposed for Top of New PBS Headquarters in Crystal City|url=https://www.arlnow.com/2020/09/09/sign-proposed-for-top-of-new-pbs-headquarters-in-crystal-city/|publisher=ARLnow|date=9 September 2020|access-date=10 September 2020|archive-date=September 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200914044828/https://www.arlnow.com/2020/09/09/sign-proposed-for-top-of-new-pbs-headquarters-in-crystal-city/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=PBS Agrees to Keep Headquarters in Crystal City, Plans to Relocate to New Building|url=https://www.arlnow.com/2019/01/15/pbs-agrees-to-keep-headquarters-in-crystal-city-plans-to-relocate-to-new-building/|editor=Alex Koma|publisher=ARLnow|date=15 January 2019|access-date=10 September 2020|archive-date=June 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200620084011/https://www.arlnow.com/2019/01/15/pbs-agrees-to-keep-headquarters-in-crystal-city-plans-to-relocate-to-new-building/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=AED/>

As of 2020, PBS has nearly 350 member stations around the nation.<ref name=AED>{{cite web|title=PBS Moves to New Crystal City HQ|url=https://www.arlingtoneconomicdevelopment.com/resources/blog/pbs-moves-to-new-crystal-city-hq/|editor=Cara O'Donnell|publisher=Arlington Economic Development|date=30 January 2019|access-date=10 September 2020|archive-date=December 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191228044036/https://www.arlingtoneconomicdevelopment.com/resources/blog/pbs-moves-to-new-crystal-city-hq/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Operations==
Unlike the five major [[commercial broadcasting|commercial broadcast]] [[television network]]s in the United States, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[The CW]], PBS is technically not a network, but rather a program distributor that provides television content and related services to its member stations. Each station is charged with the responsibility of programming local content such as news, interviews, cultural, and [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programs for their individual market or state that supplements content provided by PBS and other public television distributors.

In a television network structure, affiliates give up portions of their local advertising airtime in exchange for carrying network programming, and the network pays its affiliates a share of the revenue it earns from advertising. By contrast, PBS member stations pay fees for the shows acquired and distributed by the national organization. Under this relationship, PBS member stations have greater latitude in local scheduling than their commercial broadcasting counterparts. Scheduling of PBS-distributed series may vary greatly depending on the market. This can be a source of tension as stations seek to preserve their localism, and PBS strives to market a consistent national lineup. However, PBS has a policy of "common carriage", which requires most stations to clear the national prime time programs on a common [[broadcast programming|programming]] schedule to market them nationally more effectively. Management at former [[Los Angeles]] member [[KCET]] cited unresolvable financial and programming disputes among its major reasons for leaving PBS after over 40 years in January 2011, although it would return to PBS in 2019.<ref name="KCET">{{cite news|title=Los Angeles PBS affiliate KCET exits network fold to go independent|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/10/sorry-charlie-rose-los-angeles-pbs-affiliate-kcet-exits-network-fold-to-go-independent-.html|author=Scott Collins|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=October 8, 2010|access-date=March 12, 2015|archive-date=April 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415153244/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/10/sorry-charlie-rose-los-angeles-pbs-affiliate-kcet-exits-network-fold-to-go-independent-.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although PBS has a set schedule of programming, particularly in regard to its [[prime time]] schedule, member stations reserve the right to schedule PBS-distributed programming in other time slots or not clear it at all if they choose to do so; few of the service's members carry all its programming. Most PBS stations [[Timeshift channel|timeshift]] some distributed programs. Once PBS accepts a program offered for distribution, PBS, rather than the originating member station, retains exclusive rebroadcasting rights during an agreed period. Suppliers retain the right to sell the program in non-broadcast media such as [[DVD]]s, books, and sometimes PBS [[merchandising|licensed merchandise]].

In 1991, the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] resumed funding for most PBS shows that debuted prior to 1977, with the exceptions of ''[[Washington Week|Washington Week in Review]]'' and ''[[Wall Street Week]]'' (CPB resumed funding of ''Washington Week'' in 1997).

In 1994, ''[[The Chronicle of Philanthropy]]'' released the results of the largest study on the popularity and credibility of charitable and non-profit organizations. PBS ranked as the 11th "most popular charity/non-profit in America" from over 100 charities researched in the study conducted by the industry publication, with 38.2% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing "love" and "like a lot" for PBS.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Charities Americans Like Most And Least|work=The Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=December 13, 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Charity begins with health, Concern over diseases cited|author=Karen S.

In December 2009, PBS signed up for the [[Nielsen ratings]] [[audience measurement]] reports, and began to be included in its primetime and daily "Television Index" reports, alongside the major commercial broadcast networks.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bill Gorman|date=December 20, 2009|title=PBS Signs Up For Nielsen Ratings|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/12/20/pbs-signs-up-for-nielsen-ratings/36822|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222215318/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/12/20/pbs-signs-up-for-nielsen-ratings/36822|archive-date=December 22, 2009|access-date=March 10, 2011|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]}}</ref> In May 2011, PBS announced that it would incorporate breaks containing underwriter spots for corporate and foundation sponsors, [[promo (media)|program promotions]] and identification spots within four breaks placed within episodes of ''[[Nature (TV series)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Nova (American TV series)|NOVA]]'', airing episodes broken up into segments of up to 15 minutes, rather than airing them as straight 50- to 55-minute episodes. The strategy began that fall, with the intent to expand the in-program breaks to the remainder of the schedule if successful.<ref>{{cite news|title=PBS Plans Promotional Breaks Within Programs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/business/media/31adco.html?_r=0|author=Elizabeth Jensen|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=May 30, 2011|access-date=March 12, 2015|archive-date=April 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402233604/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/business/media/31adco.html?_r=0|url-status=live}}</ref>

PBS initially struggled to compete with online media such as [[YouTube]] for market share. In a 2012 speech to 850 top executives from PBS stations, Senior Vice President of Digital [[Jason Seiken]] warned that PBS was in danger of being disrupted by YouTube studios such as [[Maker Studios]].

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by PBS}}

The evening and primetime schedule on PBS features a diverse array of programming including [[fine arts]] (''[[Great Performances]]''); [[drama]] (''[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece]]'', ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', ''[[American Family (2002 TV series)|American Family: Journey of Dreams]]''); [[science]] (''[[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]]'', ''[[Nature (TV series)|Nature]]''); [[history]] (''[[American Experience]]'', ''[[American Masters]]'', ''[[History Detectives]]'', ''[[Antiques Roadshow (U.S. TV series)|Antiques Roadshow]]''); [[music]] (''[[Austin City Limits]]'', ''[[Soundstage (TV series)|Soundstage]]''); [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] (''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'', ''[[Washington Week]]'', [[Nightly Business Report]]); [[independent film]]s and [[documentary film|documentaries]] (''[[POV (TV series)|P.O.V.]]'', ''[[Independent Lens]]''); [[home improvement]] (''[[This Old House]]''); and [[talk show|interviews]] (''[[Amanpour & Company]]'', ''[[Tavis Smiley (TV series)|Tavis Smiley]]'', ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''). In 2012, PBS began organizing much of its prime time programming around a genre-based schedule (for example, drama series encompass the Sunday schedule, while science-related programs are featured on Wednesdays).

PBS broadcasts children's programming as part of the service's (and including content supplied by other distributors not programmed by the service, its member stations') morning and afternoon schedule. As the children's programs it distributes are intended to educate as well as entertain its target audience, PBS and its stations have long been in compliance with [[E/I|educational programming]] guidelines set by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in response to the enactment of the [[Children's Television Act|Children's Television Act of 1990]]. Many member stations have historically also broadcast [[distance education]] and other [[instructional television]] programs, typically during daytime slots; though with the advent of digital television, which has allowed stations to carry these programs on [[digital subchannel]]s in lieu of the main PBS feed or exclusively over the Internet, many member stations/networks have replaced distance education content with children's and other programming,.

Unlike its radio counterpart, [[National Public Radio]], PBS does not have a central program production arm or news division. All of the programming carried by PBS, whether news, documentary or entertainment, is created by (or in most cases produced under contract with) other parties, such as individual member stations. [[Boston]] member [[WGBH-TV]] is one of the largest producers of [[educational television]] programming, including shows like ''[[American Experience]]'', ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'', ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'', ''[[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]]'', ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' and ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', as well as many other children's and lifestyle programs. News programs are produced by [[WETA-TV]] (''[[PBS Newshour]]'') in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[WNET]] in [[New York City]] and [[WPBT]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]. Newark, New Jersey/[[New York City]] member [[WNET]] produces or distributes programs such as ''[[Secrets of the Dead]]'', ''[[Nature (TV series)|Nature]],'' and ''[[Cyberchase]]''. PBS also works with other networks for programming such as [[CNN International]] for ''[[Amanpour & Company]]'' which is a co-production of CNN International and WNET.

PBS member stations are known for rebroadcasting British television [[costume drama]]s, [[Britcoms|comedies]] and [[science fiction]] programs (acquired from the [[BBC]] and other sources) such as ''[[Downton Abbey]]''; ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]''; ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''; ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'', ''[[Red Dwarf]]''; ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]''; ''[[Father Ted]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''; ''[[Harry Enfield and Chums]]''; ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]''; ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''; ''[[Mr. Bean]]'', ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]''; consequently, this has led to jocular references that the service's name stands for "Primarily British Series". However, a significant amount of sharing takes place. The BBC and British broadcasters such as [[Channel 4]] often cooperate with PBS stations, producing material that is shown on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Less frequently, Canadian, Australian and other international programming appears on PBS stations (such as ''[[The Red Green Show]]'', currently distributed by syndicator Executive Program Services); public broadcasting syndicators are more likely to offer this programming to U.S.-based public television stations.

PBS is not the only distributor of public television programming to the member stations. Other distributors have emerged from the roots of companies that maintained loosely held regional public television stations in the 1960s. [[Boston]]-based [[American Public Television]] (which, among other names, was formerly known as Eastern Educational Network and the American Program Service) is second only to PBS for distributing programs to U.S. non-commercial stations. Another distributor is NETA (formerly SECA), whose properties have included ''[[The Shapies]]'' and ''Jerry Yarnell School of Fine Art''.<!-- [http://www.netaonline.org/ NETA] --> In addition, the member stations themselves also produce a variety of local shows, some of which subsequently receive national distribution through PBS or other distributors.

[[Rerun|Rerun programming]], especially domestic programming not originally produced for public television, is generally uncommon on PBS or its member stations. The most prominent exception to this is ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', which has aired continuously in reruns on PBS (through the [[Oklahoma Educational Television Authority]]) almost every weekend since 1986. Reruns of programs originally produced for public television are common, especially with former PBS shows whose hosts have retired or died (for example, ''[[The Joy of Painting]]'' and ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]''). Children's programming (such as ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'' and ''[[DragonflyTV]]'', the latter of which is also syndicated on commercial television) is rerun extensively.

===PBS Kids===
{{Main|PBS Kids}}

Launched as PTV on July 11, 1994, PBS Kids is the brand for [[children's programming|children's programs]] aired by PBS. The PBS Kids Channel, launched in 1999 and operated until 2005, was largely funded by satellite provider [[DirecTV]]. The channel ceased operations on September 26, 2005, in favor of [[Universal Kids|PBS Kids Sprout]], a commercial [[digital cable]] and [[satellite television]] channel originally operated as a joint venture with [[Comcast]], [[Sesame Workshop]] and [[Apax Partners]] ([[NBCUniversal]], which Comcast acquired in 2011, later acquired the other partners' interests in the channel in 2012). However, the original programming block still exists on PBS, filling daytime and in some cases, weekend morning schedules on its member stations; many members also carry 24-hour locally programmed children's networks featuring PBS Kids content on one of their digital subchannels. A revived version of the PBS Kids Channel was launched on January 16, 2017. As of 2019, PBS Kids is the only children's programming block on U.S. broadcast television.

As PBS is often known for doing, PBS Kids has broadcast imported series from other countries; these include British series originally broadcast by the [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. Through American Public Television, many PBS stations also began airing the Australian series ''[[RAGGS Kids Club Band|Raggs]]'' on June 4, 2007. Some of the programs broadcast as part of the service's children's lineup or through public broadcast syndication directly to its members have subsequently been syndicated to commercial television outlets (such as ''[[Ghostwriter (TV series)|Ghostwriter]]'' and ''[[The Magic School Bus (TV series)|The Magic School Bus]]'').

===Sports===
Many PBS member stations and networks – including [[Mississippi Public Broadcasting]] ([[Mississippi High School Activities Association|MHSAA]]), [[Georgia Public Broadcasting]] ([[Georgia High School Association|GHSA]]), [[Maine Public Broadcasting Network]] ([[Maine Principals' Association|MPA]]), [[Iowa Public Television]] ([[Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union|IGHSAU]]), [[Nebraska Educational Telecommunications]] ([[Nebraska School Activities Association|NSAA]]), and [[WKYU-TV]] ([[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers]]) – locally broadcast [[high school]] and college sports. From the 1980s onward, the national PBS network has not typically carried sporting events, mainly because the broadcast rights to most sporting events have become more cost-prohibitive in that timeframe, especially for nonprofits with limited revenue potential; in addition, starting with the respective launches of the [[MountainWest Sports Network]] (now defunct) and [[Big Ten Network]] in 2006 and 2007 and the later launches of the [[Pac-12 Network]] and [[ESPN|ESPN's]] [[SEC Network]] and [[ACC Network]], [[athletic conference]]s have acquired rights for all of their member university's sports programs for their cable channels, restricting their use from PBS member stations, even those associated with their own universities.

From 1976 to 1989, [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] produced a series of [[Bundesliga]] matches under the banner ''[[Soccer Made in Germany]]'', with [[Toby Charles]] announcing. PBS also carried [[tennis]] events, as well as [[Ivy League]] football. Notable football commentators included [[Upton Bell]], [[Marty Glickman]], [[Bob Casciola]], [[Brian Dowling (American football)|Brian Dowling]], [[Sean McDonough]] and [[Jack Corrigan (sportscaster)|Jack Corrigan]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark|title=Penn Football Tapes 1980–1989|url=http://www.letsgoquakers.com/football1980s.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021004075329/http://www.letsgoquakers.com/football1980s.htm|archive-date=4 October 2002|access-date=March 10, 2011|publisher=Letsgoquakers.com}}</ref> Other sports programs included interview series such as ''[[The Way It Was (TV series)|The Way It Was]]'' and ''The Sporting Life''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Palmer jockeys from underwear to PBS|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1985_251842/jim-palmer-jockeys-from-underwear-to-pbs.html|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|date=April 17, 1985|access-date=October 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119133716/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1985_251842/jim-palmer-jockeys-from-underwear-to-pbs.html|archive-date=November 19, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Governance==
The board of directors is responsible for governing and setting policy for PBS, consisting of 27 members: 14 professional directors (station managers), 12 general directors (outside directors), and the PBS president.<ref name=about-board>{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=https://www.pbs.org/about/about-pbs/board-directors/|author=PBS|access-date=October 27, 2015|archive-date=October 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024092447/http://www.pbs.org/about/about-pbs/board-directors/|url-status=live}}</ref> All PBS Board members serve three-year terms, without pay.<ref name=about-board/> PBS member stations elect the 14 professional directors; the board elects the 12 general directors and appoints the PBS president and CEO; and the entire board elects its officers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Donald A.

==Member stations==
{{main|List of PBS member stations}}

{{As of|March 2015}}, PBS maintains current memberships with 354 television stations encompassing 50 states, the District of Columbia and four U.S. possessions;<ref name="StationIndex" /><ref name="re">{{cite web|title=Stations for Network - PBS|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&network=PBS|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817201438/http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&network=PBS|archive-date=17 August 2011|access-date=March 12, 2015|work=RabbitEars.info}}</ref> as such, it is the only television broadcaster in the United States – commercial or non-commercial – which has station partners licensed in every U.S. state (by comparison, none of the five major commercial broadcast networks has affiliates in certain states where PBS has members, most notably [[New Jersey]]). The service has an estimated national reach of 93.74% of all households in the United States (or 292,926,047 Americans with at least one television set).

PBS stations are commonly operated by [[nonprofit organization]]s, state agencies, local authorities (such as municipal boards of education), or [[university|universities]] in their [[city of license]]; this is similar (albeit more centralized in states where a licensee owns multiple stations rebroadcasting the main PBS member) to the early model of commercial broadcasting in the U.S., in which network-affiliated stations were initially owned by companies that owned few to no other television stations elsewhere in the country. In some U.S. states, a group of PBS stations throughout the entire state may be organized into a single [[state network|regional "subnetwork"]] (such as [[Alabama Public Television]] and the [[Arkansas Educational Television Network]]); in this model, PBS programming and other content is distributed by the originating station in the subnetwork to other [[broadcast relay station|full-power stations that serve as satellites as well as any low-power translators]] in other areas of the state. Some states may be served by such a regional network and simultaneously have PBS member stations in a certain city (such as the case with secondary member [[KBDI-TV]] in [[Denver]], which is not related to [[Colorado]] member network [[Rocky Mountain PBS]] and its [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] and primary Denver PBS member, KRMA-TV) that operate autonomously from the regional member network.

As opposed to the present commercial broadcasting model in which network programs are often carried exclusively on one television station in a given market, PBS may maintain more than one member station in certain markets, which may be owned by the licensee of the market's primary PBS member station or owned by a separate licensee (as a prime example, [[KOCE-TV]], [[KLCS]] and [[KVCR-DT]] – which are all individually owned – serve as PBS stations for the Los Angeles [[media market|market]]; KCET served as the market's primary PBS member until it left the service in January 2011,<ref>{{cite news|title=KOCE takes over as top PBS station after KCET cuts ties with network|url=http://pedrowatcher.ocregister.com/2010/10/08/koce-takes-over-as-top-pbs-station-after-kcet-cuts-ties-with-network/28174/|author=Peter Larsen|newspaper=[[Orange County Register]]|publisher=[[Freedom Communications]]|date=October 8, 2010|access-date=March 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010023551/http://pedrowatcher.ocregister.com/2010/10/08/koce-takes-over-as-top-pbs-station-after-kcet-cuts-ties-with-network/28174/|archive-date=October 10, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> at which time it was replaced by KOCE). KCET rejoined PBS in 2019, thus giving the Los Angeles area four different member stations.

For these cases, PBS utilizes the Program Differentiation Plan, which divides by percentage the number of programs distributed by the service that each member can carry on their schedule; often, this assigns a larger proportion of PBS-distributed programming to the primary member station, with the secondary members being allowed to carry a lesser number of program offerings from the service's schedule. Unlike public broadcasters in most other countries, PBS cannot own any of the stations that broadcasts its programming; therefore it is one of the few television programming bodies that does not have any [[owned-and-operated station]]s. This is partly due to the origins of the PBS stations themselves, and partly due to historical [[broadcast license]] issues.

===Participating stations===
Most PBS member stations have produced at least some nationally distributed programs. Current regularly scheduled programming on the [[PBS Satellite Service|PBS national feed]] is produced by a smaller group of stations, including:
{{div col|colwidth=35em}}
* [[WGBH-TV]] (''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'', ''[[Nova (American TV series)|NOVA]]'', ''[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece]]'', ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', ''[[Martha Speaks (TV series)| Martha Speaks]]'', [[Peep and The Big Wide World]]'', ''[[Ready Jet Go!]]'', etc.)

PBS has [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] a number of [[television network]]s, often in partnership with other media companies. [[PBS YOU]], a distance education and how-to service operated until January 2006, and was largely succeeded by [[Create (TV network)|Create]] (a similarly formatted network owned by American Public Television); PBS Kids Channel was superseded by Sprout at the start of October 2005. The PBS Kids Channel relaunched January 16, 2017. [[World (TV network)|World]] began operations in 2007 as a service operated by PBS but is now managed by American Public Television.

PBS has also restructured its satellite feed system, simplifying [[PBS-HD|HD02 (PBS West)]] into a timeshift feed for the [[Pacific Time Zone]], rather than a high-definition complement to its formerly primary SD feed. [[PBS Kids Go!]] was proposed as a replacement broadcast network for PBS Kids Channel, however, plans to launch the network were folded in 2006. Programming from the PBS Satellite Service has also been carried by certain member stations or regional member networks to fill their overnight schedules (particularly those that have transitioned to a 24-hour schedule since the late 1990s), in lieu of providing programming sourced from outside public television distributors or repeats of local programming (program promotions shown on the satellite feed advertise upcoming programs as being aired on PBS during the timeslot card normally used as a placeholder for member outlets to insert local airtime information).

Some or all of these services are available on a digital cable tier of many cable providers, on a [[FTA receiver|free-to-air (FTA) satellite receiver]] receiving from [[PBS Satellite Service]], as well as via subscription-based [[direct broadcast satellite]] providers. With the exception of Sprout, some of these services, including those from PBS member stations and networks, have not made contracts with Internet-distributed [[over-the-top content|over-the-top]] [[multichannel video programming distributor|MVPD]] services such as [[Sling TV]] and the now defunct [[PlayStation Vue]]. With the transition to over-the-air [[digital television]] broadcasts, many of the services are also often now available as standard-definition [[Multicast#TV multicasting|multicast]] channels on the digital signals of some member stations, while HD02 (PBS West) serves as a secondary HD feed. With the absence of [[advertising]], network identification on these PBS networks was limited to utilization at the end of the program, which includes the standard series of [[Commercial bumper|bumpers]] from the "Be More" campaign.

At the summer 2019 [[Television Critics Association]] press tour day for PBS on July 29, 2019, it was announced that MVPD [[YouTube TV]] would begin to carry PBS programming and member stations in the fall of 2019. Member stations have the choice of having their traditional channel on the service with its full programming schedule received by Google over-the-air and uploaded to the service, a YouTube TV-only feed provided by the station with some programming substitutions due to lack of digital rights, or a PBS-provided feed with limited localization, though with no local programming or pledge drive programming.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://current.org/2019/07/pbs-forges-deal-with-youtube-tv-for-localized-live-streams/|title=PBS forges deal with YouTube TV for localized live streams|last=Goldsmith|first=Jill|date=July 29, 2019|work=[[Current (magazine)|Current]]|access-date=August 12, 2019|archive-date=July 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730133745/https://current.org/2019/07/pbs-forges-deal-with-youtube-tv-for-localized-live-streams/|url-status=live}}</ref>

On September 3, 2020, PBS began to offer a livestream of their member stations for free via its website (as well as the websites from the member stations), on smart TVs, and on their mobile apps. However, only a small handful of stations currently do not have a livestream of their stations set up.<ref>https://thestreamable.com/news/pbs-launches-live-local-streaming-of-pbs-stations</ref>
===Independent networks===
While not operated or controlled by PBS proper, additional public broadcasting networks are available and carried by PBS member stations.

From 2002 to 2011, [[Buffalo, New York]] member station [[WNED-TV]] operated [[ThinkBright|ThinkBright TV]], a service that was carried on several stations in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]]. Several state networks also offer a [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] subchannel network offering full-time coverage of state government events and legislative/judicial proceedings in the same vein as [[C-SPAN]]'s coverage of the federal government. Many PBS stations also carried MHz Worldview from the [[MHz Networks]] until 2020 when MHz Networks announced its discontinuation of the network on March 1, 2020. Since then, many stations has switched to World Channel as well as [[First Nations Experience]].

A separate but related concept is the [[state network]], where a group of stations across a state simulcast a single programming schedule from a central facility, which may include specialty subchannels unique to that broadcaster.

The logo was designed by Ernie Smith and [[Herb Lubalin]] of the Lubalin Smith Carnase design firm.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jennifer Dunning|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/14/arts/ernie-smith-79-jazz-and-dance-authority.html|title=Ernie Smith, 79, Jazz and Dance Authority|work=The New York Times|date=April 4, 2004|quote=He worked at several advertising agencies in New York.

In 1984, PBS introduced a new version of the logo, designed by [[Tom Geismar]] of [[Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv|Chermayeff & Geismar]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/books/art-a-laboratory-for-sign-language.html|title=ART; A Laboratory for Sign Language|last=Heller|first=Steven|date=2003-12-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202230544/https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/books/art-a-laboratory-for-sign-language.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Chermayeff & Geismar felt that the Lubalin-designed logo was too similar to those of the three dominant commercial networks of the time, and they sought "to develop a symbol that could stand for the more inclusive concept of 'public television'". They inverted Lubalin's Everyman "P" to face to the right instead of the left, and repeated the outline as a series to represent a "multitude" of people. The symbol was subsequently renamed "Everyone".<ref name="Identify"/> The repeated outline of the face has also been interpreted to suggest a degree of [[multiculturalism]], as well as the public service aspect of the PBS mission.<ref>{{cite book| last = Gernsheimer| first = Jack| title = Designing Logos: The Process of Creating Symbols that Endure| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=E9w61v7UyR4C&pg=PA125| year = 2008| publisher = Allworth Press| isbn = 978-1-58115-649-2| page = 125| access-date = December 2, 2019| archive-date = July 13, 2020| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200713032241/https://books.google.com/books?id=E9w61v7UyR4C&pg=PA125| url-status = live}}</ref>

The logo has been used in various forms since: from 1998 onward, the Geismar logo has been rendered in white on a circle.<ref name = "Identify"/>

On November 4, 2019, in honor of the network's 50th anniversary, PBS unveiled a redesign of its [[corporate identity|identity]] by [[Lippincott (brand consultancy)|Lippincott]]. The identity is intended to be better-suited for use on digital platforms, and includes a tweaked version of the Geismar logo, adoption of [[electric blue (color)|electric blue]] and white as corporate colors, and a new custom [[sans-serif]] typeface used in communications and inspired by the new custom logotype (which replaces the [[slab serif]] typeface used in the PBS logo since 1984).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90425497/pbs-unveils-a-new-brand-for-a-new-media-landscape|title=PBS's new brand is anything but radical—and that's the whole point|last=Smith|first=Lilly|date=2019-11-04|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-02|archive-date=December 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213085631/https://www.fastcompany.com/90425497/pbs-unveils-a-new-brand-for-a-new-media-landscape|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="current-newlogo">{{Cite web|url=https://current.org/2019/11/pbs-begins-rollout-of-electric-blue-brand-refresh/|title=PBS begins rollout of electric-blue brand refresh|last=Goldsmith|first=Jill|website=Current|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03|archive-date=November 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112173243/https://current.org/2019/11/pbs-begins-rollout-of-electric-blue-brand-refresh/|url-status=live}}</ref> The network is allowing flexibility in implementation (including members re-branding to include PBS in their name for the first time, such as Wisconsin Public Television rebranding as [[PBS Wisconsin]]), but is no longer allowing the logo to be displayed independently of the PBS name.<ref name="current-newlogo" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/342923/pbs-overhauls-logo-for-2020.html|title=PBS Overhauls Logo For 2020|website=Mediapost.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02|archive-date=November 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106230117/https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/342923/pbs-overhauls-logo-for-2020.html|url-status=live}}</ref> PBS is paying out grants to at least 100 members to cover costs associated with the rebranding.<ref name="current-newlogo" />

===On-air fundraising===
Since 53% to 60% of public television's revenues come from private membership donations and [[grants]],<ref name="revenue">{{cite web|title=Public Broadcasting Revenue Fiscal Year 2005|url=http://www.cpb.org/stations/reports/revenue/2005PublicBroadcastingRevenue.pdf|publisher=[[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]|access-date=March 10, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515140419/http://www.cpb.org/stations/reports/revenue/2005PublicBroadcastingRevenue.pdf|archive-date=May 15, 2011}}</ref> most stations solicit individual donations by methods including [[fundraising]], [[pledge drive]]s or [[telethon]]s, which disrupt regularly scheduled programming. This has been perceived as potentially annoying since regularly scheduled programming is often replaced with specials aimed at a wider audience (such as music specials aimed at the [[Baby Boom]]er generation and financial, health and motivational programs) to solicit new members and donations; during fundraising events, these programs are often interrupted within the broadcast by long-form segments (of six to eight minutes in length) encouraging viewers to donate to their PBS member.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pledging Allegiance, or March Madness?|url=https://www.pbs.org/ombudsman/2006/03/pledging_allegiance_or_march_madness.html|author=Michael Getler|publisher=PBS Ombudsman|date=March 24, 2006|access-date=May 22, 2006|author-link=Michael Getler|archive-date=April 8, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408140959/http://www.pbs.org/ombudsman/2006/03/pledging_allegiance_or_march_madness.html|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Underwriting spot]]s are aired at the end of each program, which differ from traditional commercials in several ways.<ref>{{cite web|title=PBS Guidelines for On-Air Announcements|url=https://www.pbs.org/producers/guidelines/onair_rule5.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414070210/https://www.pbs.org/producers/guidelines/onair_rule5.html|archive-date=2014-04-14|access-date=April 13, 2014|publisher=PBS}}</ref> Each spot must be approved to meet several guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|title=PBS Guidelines for On-Air Announcements|url=https://www.pbs.org/producers/guidelines/onair.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414090628/https://www.pbs.org/producers/guidelines/onair.html|archive-date=2014-04-14|access-date=April 13, 2014|publisher=PBS}}</ref> The main guidelines state that underwriting spots cannot be qualitative in any way, nor can they have any call to action.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voice-Over Copy Guidelines|url=https://www.pbs.org/producers/guidelines/onair_rule5.html#5.4|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030923073228/https://www.pbs.org/producers/guidelines/onair_rule5.html|archive-date=23 September 2003|access-date=April 13, 2014|publisher=PBS}}</ref>

===Accusations of political/ideological bias===
A 1982 broadcast of the [[United States Information Agency]] program ''Let Poland be Poland'' about the [[Martial law in Poland|martial law declared in Poland in 1981]] was widely viewed in the U.S., but met with skepticism on the part of eastern European broadcasters (communist countries at the time) due to concerns that the program's "provocative and anticommunist" tone was intended as propaganda.<ref>{{cite web|title=Let Poland Be Poland (1982, TV)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0785022/|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|access-date=February 4, 2016|archive-date=February 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201042929/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0785022/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=US Public Diplomacy in Hungary: Past and Present |url=http://www.publicdiplomacycouncil.org/uploads/Eichler_Public_Diplomacy_Hungary.pdf |author=Edward Eichler |work=Public Diplomacy Council |date=April 25, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225051216/http://www.publicdiplomacycouncil.org/uploads/Eichler_Public_Diplomacy_Hungary.pdf |archive-date=February 25, 2009}}</ref>

In 1999, at least three public television stations were caught selling or trading their mailing lists with the Democratic National Committee. Under [[IRS]] regulations, nonprofit organizations are prohibited from participating in political actions. Officials from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting condemned the practice and conducted an investigation into the matter. The stations involved were in New York, Boston, and Washington.<ref name="NYT2">{{cite news|last1=SEELYE|first1=KATHARINE Q.|title=PBS Stations Shared Donor Lists With Democrats, Stirring Trouble|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/17/us/pbs-stations-shared-donor-lists-with-democrats-stirring-trouble.html|access-date=March 31, 2017|work=New York Times|date=July 17, 1999|archive-date=April 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401061449/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/17/us/pbs-stations-shared-donor-lists-with-democrats-stirring-trouble.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Individual programs aired by PBS have been the targets of organized campaigns by individuals and groups with opposing views, including former [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Margaret Spellings]].<ref name="msnbc-012605">{{cite news|title=Education chief rips PBS for gay character: Network won't distribute episode with animated 'Buster' visiting Vt.|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6869976|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=NBC News|date=January 26, 2005|access-date=November 10, 2019|archive-date=November 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121224256/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6869976/|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Bill Moyers]] resigned in 2005 after more than three decades as a PBS regular, citing political pressure to alter the content of his program and saying Chairman of the Board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting [[Kenneth Tomlinson]] had mounted a "vendetta" against him.<ref name="farhi">{{cite web|title=PBS Scrutiny Raises Political Antennas|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8067-2005Apr21.html|author=Paul Farhi|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]]|date=April 22, 2005|access-date=September 7, 2017|archive-date=June 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622060245/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8067-2005Apr21.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Moyers eventually returned to host ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]]'', after Tomlinson's resignation from CPB.

===Lawsuit with Pacific Arts===
In the 1990s, PBS became involved in a dispute over home video licensing rights with [[Pacific Arts Corporation]], a multimedia company owned and operated by former [[The Monkees|Monkees]] guitarist [[Michael Nesmith]].

In 1990, Pacific Arts secured a contract with PBS to distribute their back catalog of programming on VHS under the [[PBS Home Video]] banner. However, in the early 1990s, Pacific Arts and PBS went through a series of serious disagreements. Lawsuits were filed: by Nesmith and Pacific Arts against PBS for breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation, intentional concealment, negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract; and by PBS against Nesmith and Pacific Arts for lost royalties.<ref name="current">{{cite web|last1=Behrens|first1=Steve|title=Nesmith wins $47 million in video suit against PBS|url=http://current.org/files/archive-site/pbs/pbs902v.html|website=[[KCMP|The Current]]|access-date=May 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818000313/http://current.org/files/archive-site/pbs/pbs902v.html|archive-date=August 18, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The lawsuits escalated in 1994 and 1995 into major litigation between the parties over these rights and payments. PBS and Nesmith and Pacific Arts vigorously prosecuted these multimillion-dollar counter-suits.

The six plaintiffs included PBS, [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]], [[WNET]], the [[Ken Burns]]-owned American Documentaries and Radio Pioneers Film Project and the [[Children's Television Workshop]]. They sought approximately $5 million in disputed royalties, advances, guarantees and license fees for programs and the use of the PBS logo from the defendants Pacific Arts and Nesmith.

Due to the cost of the litigation, Pacific Arts was forced to cease distribution operations and suspended the use of the PBS logo on the Pacific Arts videos.<ref name="current"/> Though Pacific Arts distribution system had ceased operating, the various plaintiffs were counting on capturing a personal financial guarantee Nesmith had made to PBS in the original PBS deal in 1990.

The cases went to jury trial in Federal Court in Los Angeles in February 1999. After three days of deliberation, the jury unanimously sided with Nesmith.<ref name="pacarts">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/03/business/jury-rules-that-pbs-must-pay-video-distributor-47-million.html|title=Jury Rules That PBS Must Pay Video Distributor $47 Million|last1=Mifflin|first1=Lawrie|date=February 3, 1999|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=May 30, 2016|archive-date=June 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630171648/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/03/business/jury-rules-that-pbs-must-pay-video-distributor-47-million.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The court awarded Pacific Arts $14,625,000 for loss of its rights library, plus $29,250,000 in punitive damages. The jury awarded $3 million to Nesmith personally, including $2 million in punitive damages for a total award to Nesmith and Pacific Arts of $48,875,000. The jury resolved the outstanding license fee issues by ordering Pacific Arts and Nesmith to pay approximately $1.2 million to American Documentaries for ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'', about $230,000 to [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]], and $150,000 to [[WNET]].<ref name="current"/>

Following the ruling, Nesmith expressed his personal disappointment with PBS and was quoted by [[BBC News]] as stating "It's like finding your grandmother stealing your stereo. You're happy to get your stereo back, but it's sad to find out your grandmother is a thief."<ref>{{cite web|title=Hey, hey, it's a Monkee victory|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/271357.stm|website=BBC News|access-date=May 30, 2016|archive-date=April 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409001839/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/271357.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The decision never went to an appeals court and the final amount paid to Pacific Arts and Nesmith was an undisclosed sum agreed to in an out-of-court settlement.
