[[Jeremy Corbyn]] assumed the position of [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] after [[2015 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|being elected]] as [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|leader of the Labour Party]] on 12 September 2015; the election was triggered by [[Ed Miliband]]'s resignation following the Labour Party's electoral defeat at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] when [[David Cameron]] formed a [[Second Cameron ministry|majority Conservative government]].

==Creation==
Corbyn named his first Shadow Cabinet appointments on 13 September and announced its full composition on 14 September. One of Labour's largest reshuffles, the announcement was further delayed by a large number of previous Shadow Cabinet members publicly announcing they would not participate under Corbyn, even if called to do so. The following members declined to serve:

==Composition==
* In his inaugural Shadow Cabinet, 17 out of 31 members were women, making it the first [[Frontbencher|frontbench team]] in British parliamentary history to comprise a female majority. Corbyn was criticised for giving what are traditionally seen as the top jobs (Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary) to men, although he insisted that positions such as Education and Health Secretary were just as important.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dathan |first=Matt |title=Jeremy Corbyn comes out fighting amid sexism row and insists shadow Cabinet positions he has given to women are the real 'top jobs' |work=[[The Independent]] |date=14 September 2015 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-more-women-appointed-to-shadow-cabinet-than-men-for-first-time-10500032.html |accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>

{{Main|June 2016 British shadow cabinet resignations}}
On Sunday 26 June and Monday 27 June 2016, a number of members of the shadow cabinet either resigned or were sacked.

Subsequently, the following resigned (in chronological order):
