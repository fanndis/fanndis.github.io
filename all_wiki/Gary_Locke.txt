Locke graduated with honors from Seattle's [[Franklin High School (Seattle)|Franklin High School]] in 1968. He achieved [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] rank and received the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] from the [[Scouting in Washington (state)|Boy Scouts of America]].<ref name="english"/><ref name="HistoryLinkBio">{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?displaypage=output.cfm&file_id=7830| title=Locke, Gary Faye (b. 1950)|publisher=[[HistoryLink]]|author=Frank Chesley|date= June 29, 2006|accessdate=March 25, 2009}}</ref> Through a combination of part-time jobs, financial aid, and scholarships, Locke attended [[Yale University]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[political science]] in 1972.<ref name=AsianBio>{{cite web|accessdate=November 9, 2008|url=http://www.asianamerican.net/bios/Locke-Gary.html|title=Biography of Governor Gary Locke|website=Who's Who of Asian Americans}}</ref> He received his [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Boston University School of Law]] in 1975.

==Career==
===Washington representative===
In 1982, Locke was elected from a South Seattle district to the [[Washington House of Representatives]], where he served as the chair of the Appropriations Committee. Eleven years later, in 1993, Locke was elected [[King County, Washington|King County]]'s executive, defeating incumbent [[Tim Hill (politician)|Tim Hill]].

===Governor===
In 1996, Locke won the [[1996 Washington gubernatorial election|Democratic primary and general election for governor of Washington]], becoming the first Chinese American governor in United States history. His political committee was fined $2,500 by regulators in 1997 after admitting to state campaign finance law violations.<ref name="Sidoti">{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090225/ap_on_go_pr_wh/obama_commerce |title=Obama selected Locke to run Commerce Department |agency=Associated Press |work=[[Yahoo!

Locke faced criticism from fellow Democrats for embracing the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s "no-new-taxes" approach to Washington's budget woes during and after the 2001 economic turmoil. Among his spending-reduction proposals were laying off thousands of state employees; reducing health coverage; freezing most state employees' pay; and cutting funding for nursing homes and programs for the [[developmentally disabled]]. In his final budget, Locke suspended two voter-passed school initiatives and cut state education funding. Supported by the state's political left, former [[Washington Supreme Court]] Justice [[Phil Talmadge]] announced his plans to challenge Locke in the 2004 Democratic primary, but Talmadge ended his campaign early for health reasons; Locke [[2000 Washington gubernatorial election|won reelection in 2000]].

On the national stage, Democrats saw Locke as a possible vice-presidential choice. In 1997, he was a guest at the [[State of the Union address]].<ref>{{cite web|author = Clinton, Bill|title = Remarks By The President In State Of The Union Address|website = The White House|date = February 4, 1997|url = http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/SOU97/|accessdate = February 24, 2009|quote = Gary Locke, the newly elected Governor of Washington State, is the first Chinese American governor in the history of our country.

Eventually, then-[[Colorado]] Senator [[Ken Salazar]] was nominated for that position instead.

Early in Locke's ambassadorship, Chinese dissident [[Chen Guangcheng]] escaped from house arrest and sought refuge in the [[U.S. Embassy in Beijing]] in April 2012. On May 2, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] demanded an apology from the U.S. for its role in the incident.<ref>[http://thinkingchinese.com/Chinas-Ministry-of-Foreign-Affairs-demands-that-the-US-apologizes-for-the-Chen-Guangcheng-incident 外交部要求美方就陈光诚一事向中方道歉 – The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs demands that the US apologizes for the Chen Guangcheng incident] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CIJDqZvW?url=http://thinkingchinese.com/Chinas-Ministry-of-Foreign-Affairs-demands-that-the-US-apologizes-for-the-Chen-Guangcheng-incident |date=2012-11-19 }} (bilingual), [http://thinkingchinese.com Thinking Chinese], May 2012</ref> In an editorial on May 4, ''[[Beijing Daily]]'' questioned Locke's motives by taking Chen in,<ref name="scmp20120518jiao"/> describing Chen as "a tool and a pawn for American politicians to blacken China."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47289362#.T6Ne0utSSYk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505133854/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47289362#.T6Ne0utSSYk |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 5, 2012 |title=China paper calls Chen a U.S. pawn; envoy is a "troublemaker" |author=Chris Buckley |date=May 4, 2012 |agency=Reuters |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}</ref>

In late November 2013, Locke announced that he would step down as ambassador to spend more time with his family in Seattle. In an analysis of his ambassadorship, Sun Zhe, a professor at [[Tsinghua University]] in [[Beijing]], said, "It is not an easy job to be the American ambassador to China. Gary Locke is not a shining star, but a simple and unadorned ambassador." Shen Dingli, dean of the international studies department at [[Fudan University]] in [[Shanghai]], largely concurred, commenting that Locke "showed us how a U.S. minister-level official behaves by taking economy-class flights" but "caused a twist" when he allowed Chen refuge in the U.S. embassy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Denyer|first=Simon|title=U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke to step down, rejoin family in Seattle|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/us-ambassador-to-china-to-step-down-to-rejoin-family-in-seattle/2013/11/20/1b0ea914-51f1-11e3-9ee6-2580086d8254_story.html|accessdate=February 22, 2014|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=November 20, 2013}}</ref> [[Max Baucus]], a former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Montana]], was Obama's nominee to replace Locke and was confirmed by the Senate 96–0; Vice President [[Joe Biden]] administered the [[oath of office]] on February 21, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last=Herman|first=Malia Rulon|title=Max Baucus sworn in as ambassador|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/article/20140221/NEWS01/302210009/Max-Baucus-sworn-in-as-ambassador|accessdate=February 22, 2014|newspaper=[[Great Falls Tribune]]|date=February 21, 2014}}</ref>

I’m proud of the great contributions that China has made to world civilization over thousands of years. But I’m thoroughly American. I’m proud of the great values that America has brought to the entire world and all that America stands for."<ref>Wan, William.

==Political views==
When asked if there is place for Asian Americans in politics, Locke had this to say:

"I think our native cultures have emphasized respect for our elders, care of our elders, but also focusing on education. But my overall response is that Asian Americans are part and parcel of the great success of America. Our grandparents came over in the 1800s to work in the railroads, work the lumber camps, goldmines, worked in the canneries, farmland that most people thought could never raise a crop, worked as merchants in cities that were just emerging. They fought in world wars, died for our freedoms and our liberties. Asian Americans have given our blood, sweat and tears to the communities and to this country. There's a prosperity that we on the west coast enjoy. So much of the prosperity and progress of the western states is because of the blood, sweat and tears of Asian Americans. From doing the dirty work to fighting in our world wars and contributing to our society now as doctors, researchers, people in high tech, as innovators, in all different professions. We have every right, indeed a responsibility, to help set the policies that will move our communities and our nation forward."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kagy |first1=Tom |title=Gary Locke: Governor Fix-It |url=http://goldsea.com/Personalities/Lockegary/lockegary.html |website=Goldsea |accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref>
