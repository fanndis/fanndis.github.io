He previously served as [[Prime Minister of Belgium]] between 2014 and 2019.

Michel became [[Minister of Development Cooperation (Belgium)|Minister of Development Cooperation]] in 2007, and remained in this position until elected the leader of the [[Francophone]] liberal [[Mouvement Réformateur|Reformist Movement]] (MR) in February 2011. He led MR to the [[2014 Belgian federal election|2014 federal election]], where they emerged as the third-largest party in the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]]. After [[2014 Belgian government formation|coalition negotiations]], Michel was confirmed as Prime Minister of a MR-[[New Flemish Alliance|N-VA]]-[[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|OVLD]]-[[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|CD&V]] government. He was sworn in on 11 October 2014, becoming the youngest Belgian Prime Minister since 1845. 

In December 2018, the government collapsed following internal disagreements over the handling of the [[Global Compact for Migration]], with the N-VA withdrawing from the cabinet. Michel subsequently tendered his resignation and remained in office in a [[caretaker government|caretaker capacity]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Dunst |first=Charles |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/michel-takes-belgium-lead-of-belgian-caretaker-government/ |title=Charles Michel to head Belgian caretaker government – POLITICO |publisher=Politico.eu |date= |accessdate=2020-05-28}}</ref> At the [[2019 Belgian federal election|2019 federal election]] shortly afterwards, MR lost a number of seats, although Michel remained in office as interim Prime Minister during coalition negotiations. Weeks after the federal election, on 2 July 2019, the [[European Council]] voted to appoint Michel as its new [[President of the European Council|President]]. He took over from [[Donald Tusk]] at a ceremony on 29 November 2019, formally beginning his term on 1 December 2019.<ref name="29-11-19 press release">{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/president/news/20191129-handover-pec/|title=Charles Michel takes over from Donald Tusk as President of the European Council|date=29 November 2019|website=General Secretariat of the Council|language=en|others=Press release|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref><ref name="EUCOpres">{{cite tweet|user=eucopresident|number=1200377814203142144|date=29 November 2019|title=It's time: I am handing over the #EUCO bell & this Twitter account to my friend @CharlesMichel.

== Early life and education ==
Charles Michel was born in [[Namur]], [[Wallonia]], on 21 December 1975. He is the son of [[Louis Michel]], a former [[European Commissioner]], and Martine Pierre.

Michel began his political career at the age of 16 when he joined the Young Liberal Reformers of Jodoigne (''Jeunes Réformateurs Libéraux de Jodoigne''), affiliated to the MR. In 1994, at the age of 18, he was elected provincial councilor in [[Walloon Brabant]]. He graduated in law at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] (ULB) and the [[University of Amsterdam]] in 1998, after which he became lawyer at the Brussels Bar. He is fluent in Dutch and English in addition to his native French.

== Early political career ==
Michel was elected to the federal [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]] in [[1999 Belgian federal election|1999]], representing [[Walloon Brabant]], a stronghold of the liberal MR.

In 2000, he became Minister of Home Affairs in the [[Walloon Government]] aged 25, making him the youngest regional minister in Belgian history.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/charles-michel-officiellement-candidat-a-la-presidence-du-mr/article-normal-150275.html|title=Charles Michel officiellement candidat à la présidence du MR|publisher=Le Vif|date=13 December 2010}}</ref> At the local level, he was elected city councillor in [[Wavre]] in 2000, and in 2006 became mayor of the city.

In December 2007, Michel became the [[Minister of Development Cooperation (Belgium)|Minister of Development Cooperation]] in the [[Verhofstadt III Government]] and subsequently in the [[Leterme I Government|Leterme I]], [[Van Rompuy Government|Van Rompuy I]] and [[Leterme II Government|Leterme II]] governments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/mopdf/2008/03/21_2.pdf|title=20 March 2008 – Royal Orders. Government – Dismissals – Appointments|publisher=The [[Belgian Official Journal]]|date=21 March 2008|pages=3–4|accessdate=30 March 2008|language=Dutch, French}}</ref>

After poor results in the [[2009 Belgian regional elections|2009 regional elections]], Michel was part of a group demanding the MR leader [[Didier Reynders]] resign. After the party suffered further losses in the [[2010 Belgian federal election|2010 federal election]], Reynders resigned, and Michel announced his candidacy to replace him. In January 2011, he was elected President of MR, and resigned from the cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/5036/Wetstraat/article/detail/1930064/2014/06/27/Michel-vs-Reynders-waarom-de-MR-elke-keer-wat-anders-zegt.dhtml|title=Michel vs. Reynders: waarom de MR elke keer wat anders zegt|publisher=De Morgen|date=27 June 2014}}</ref>

After the [[2014 Belgian federal election|2014 federal election]], Michel became co-[[formateur]] in the ensuing [[2014 Belgian government formation|coalition negotiations]]. Initially, [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|CD&V]] Leader [[Kris Peeters]] was expected to be Prime Minister. However CD&V also insisted on [[Marianne Thyssen]] being appointed as [[European Commissioner]], and Michel's MR refused to allow the two most important political posts to be held by a single party.

Ultimately, the parties agreed to appoint Thyssen as European Commissioner, with an understanding that the prime ministership would go to either MR or [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|OVLD]]. As Michel was serving as co-formateur, he quickly won internal support from other parties to lead the next government. On 7 October 2014, an overall agreement was reached between the four parties to form a new government, with Michel proposed as Prime Minister, and Peeters as one of four Deputy Prime Ministers. Michel became the youngest Belgian Prime Minister, and was only the second Francophone liberal to become Prime Minister.<ref>[http://www.hbvl.be/cnt/dmf20141008_01309668/dit-waren-de-jongste-en-de-oudste-eerste-ministers-van-ons-land "Dit waren de jongste en de oudste eerste ministers van ons land"].

''De Standaard''. 7 October 2014</ref>

In December 2018, a political crisis emerged over whether to sign the [[Global Compact for Migration]]. Michel's coalition partner N-VA, which originally supported the Compact, reversed course to oppose it whereas the other three parties continued to support it. Michel subsequently announced the formation of a [[minority government]], with CD&V, MR and OVLD backing the compact.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lesoir.be/194570/article/2018-12-08/charles-michel-confirme-quil-ira-marrakech-je-prends-acte-que-la-n-va-quitte-la|title=Charles Michel confirme qu'il ira à Marrakech: "Je prends acte que la N-VA quitte la majorité suédoise"|website=Le Soir|language=fr|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tijd.be/politiek-economie/belgie/federaal/michel-zet-minderheidsregering-zonder-n-va-in-de-steigers/10077382.html|title=Michel zet minderheidsregering zonder N-VA in de steigers|date=2018-12-08|website=De Tijd|language=nl|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2018/12/08/_road-to-minority-government-being-paved/|title=Road to minority government being paved|last=News|first=Flanders|date=2018-12-08|website=vrtnws.be|language=en|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref> On 18 December, he presented his government's resignation to the King.

== President of the European Council ==
On 2 July 2019, Michel was elected [[President of the European Council]], one of the most prominent leadership positions of the [[European Union]].<ref>[https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20190702_04490461 Europese knoop ontward: Charles Michel wordt voorzitter van de Europese Raad]</ref>

In August 2020, Michel expressed "full solidarity" with [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]] in their conflict with [[Turkey]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Greek PM: "It is not possible for the EU to adopt a different stance on Belarus and another on Turkey" |url=https://greekcitytimes.com/2020/08/20/greek-pm-it-is-not-possible-for-the-eu-to-adopt-a-different-stance-on-belarus-and-another-on-turkey/ |work=Greek City Times |date=20 August 2020}}</ref> which has [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|occupied the northern part of Cyprus]] since July 1974.

On 27 September 2020, Michel expressed deep concern over the [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|escalation of hostilities]] in the disputed region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and called on [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] to immediately halt fighting and progress towards a peaceful resolution.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Armenia-Azerbaijan clashes: How the world reacted|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/27/armenia-azerbaijan-clashes-world-reactions|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200927124156/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/27/armenia-azerbaijan-clashes-world-reactions|archive-date=27 September 2020|website=aljazeera.com|language=en}}</ref>
