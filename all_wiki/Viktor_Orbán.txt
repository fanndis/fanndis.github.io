'''Viktor Mihály Orbán'''<ref>[http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20121220-a-story-osszeallitasa-33-dolog-amit-nem-tudunk-orban-viktorrol.html Orbánnak kiütötték az első két fogát], ''[[Origo (website)|Origo]]'', 20 December 2012; accessed 30 August 2012.</ref> ({{IPA-hu|ˈviktor ˈorbaːn|lang|OrbánViktor.ogg}}; born 31 May 1963) is a Hungarian politician who has been [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] since 2010; he was also Prime Minister from 1998 to 2002. He has also been [[Fidesz|President of Fidesz]], a [[National conservatism|national conservative]] political party, since 1993, with a brief break between 2000 and 2003.

Born in [[Székesfehérvár]], Orbán studied law at [[Eötvös Loránd University]], graduating in 1987. He briefly studied [[political science]] at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], before returning to Hungary to enter politics in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1989|Autumn of Nations]]. He became head of the reformist student movement the Alliance of Young Democrats ({{lang|hu|Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége}}), which would eventually become the Fidesz party. Orbán became a nationally known politician after giving an address at the 1989 reburial of [[Imre Nagy]] and other [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|martyrs of the 1956 revolution]], in which he openly demanded that Soviet troops withdraw from the country.

After the [[end of communism in Hungary (1989)|transition to democracy]] in 1990, he was elected to the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|National Assembly]] and served as the leader of Fidesz's parliamentary caucus until 1993. Under his leadership, Fidesz shifted away from its original [[centre-right politics|centre-right]], [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]], [[European integration|pro-European integration]] platform toward more [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] national conservatism. After Fidesz won a plurality of seats in the [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998 election]], Orbán was appointed Prime Minister for the first time.

Fidesz narrowly lost the [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]] and [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|2006 elections]] to the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], with Orbán spending this period as [[Leader of the Opposition (Hungary)|Leader of the Opposition]]. The fall in popularity of the Socialists, exacerbated by Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]]'s "[[Őszöd speech]]", helped Orbán lead Fidesz to a [[2010 Hungarian parliamentary election|landslide victory]] in 2010. Orbán formed a coalition with the [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democrats]], giving him a supermajority in the National Assembly, which he used to introduce [[constitution of Hungary#2013 amendments|major constitutional and legislative reforms]]. Fidesz retained its supermajority in the [[2014 Hungarian parliamentary election|2014]] and [[2018 Hungarian parliamentary election|2018 elections]]. In November 2020, Orbán became the [[list of Prime Ministers of Hungary by tenure|longest-serving Prime Minister]], surpassing [[Kálmán Tisza]], who served as prime minister from 1875 to 1890.<ref>{{cite web |last= Szurovecz |first= Illés |title=Varga Judittól kellett megtudnunk, hogy Orbán Viktor többet volt hatalmon, mint bármelyik magyar miniszterelnök a történelemben |url= https://444.hu/2020/11/30/varga-judittol-kellett-megtudnunk-hogy-orban-viktor-tobbet-volt-hatalmon-mint-barmelyik-magyar-miniszterelnok-a-tortenelemben |date=2020-11-30}}</ref>

Orbán's [[Christian democracy]], [[social conservatism]], [[national conservatism]], [[soft Euroscepticism]] and advocacy of what he describes as an "[[illiberal democracy|illiberal state]]" have attracted significant international attention.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hungarian PM sees shift to illiberal Christian democracy in 2019 European vote |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-orban/hungarian-pm-sees-shift-to-illiberal-christian-democracy-in-2019-european-vote-idUSKBN1KI0BK |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=29 July 2020 |language=English |date=28 July 2018 |quote=Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Saturday that European parliament elections next year could bring about a shift toward illiberal “Christian democracy” in the European Union that would end the era of multiculturalism.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://budapestbeacon.com/full-text-of-viktor-orbans-speech-at-baile-tusnad-tusnadfurdo-of-26-july-2014/|title=Full text of Viktor Orbán’s speech at Băile Tuşnad (Tusnádfürdő) of 26 July 2014|date=30 July 2014}}</ref> During his time in government since 2010, Hungary has experienced [[democratic backsliding]], shifting towards [[authoritarianism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Frances E.|date=2019-09-03|title=Populism and the American Party System: Opportunities and Constraints|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=18|issue=2|pages=371|doi=10.1017/s1537592719002664|issn=1537-5927}}</ref><ref name="econ17">{{cite news|title=What to do when Viktor Orban erodes democracy|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21723835-europe-has-tools-make-autocrat-back-down-what-do-when-viktor-orban-erodes-democracy|magazine=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/world/europe/hungary-orban-democracy-far-right.html|title=As West Fears the Rise of Autocrats, Hungary Shows What's Possible|last=Kingsley|first=Patrick|date=2018-02-10|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=10 February 2018|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kelemen|first=R.

==Early life==
Orbán was born on 31 May 1963 in [[Székesfehérvár]] into a rural middle-class family, as the eldest son of the entrepreneur and [[Agronomy|agronomist]] Győző Orbán (born 1940)<ref>[http://hvg.hu/kkv/20120708_orbanpapa_kobanyaceg ''A Közgép is hizlalhatja Orbán Győző cégét''], [[Heti Világgazdaság]], 11 July 2012.</ref> and the [[Special education|special educator]] and [[Speech-language pathology|speech therapist]], Erzsébet Sípos (born 1944).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Erzsébet-S%C3%ADpos/6000000023233361295 |title=Erzsébet Sípos |website=[[Geni.com]] |accessdate=19 March 2019}}</ref> He has two younger brothers, both entrepreneurs, Győző, Jr. (born 1965) and Áron (born 1977). His paternal grandfather, Mihály Orbán, practiced farming and [[animal husbandry]]. Orbán spent his childhood in two nearby villages, [[Alcsútdoboz]] and [[Felcsút]] in [[Fejér County]];{{sfn|Paul Lendvai|2017|p=11–12}} he attended school there and in [[Vértesacsa]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Árpád |last=Pünkösti |title=Szeplőtelen fogantatás 7. |url=http://nol.hu/archivum/archiv-6407-2436 |website=[[Népszabadság]] |date=13 May 2000 |accessdate=19 March 2019 |language=Hungarian}}</ref><ref name="biography">{{citation |language = Hungarian|url = http://www.parlament.hu/kepviselo/elet/o320.htm |title = Orbán Viktor |year = 1996 |type = biography |trans-title=Viktor Orbán | publisher = arlament |place = Hungary}}</ref> In 1977, his family moved permanently to Székesfehérvár.{{sfn|Paul Lendvai|2017|pp=14, 265}}

Orbán graduated from Blanka Teleki High School in Székesfehérvár in 1981, where he studied English. After completing two years of military service, he studied law at [[Eötvös Loránd University]] in [[Budapest]], writing his master's thesis on the Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kenney|first1=Padraic|title=A Carnival of Revolution: Central Europe 1989|date=2002|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=0-691-05028-7|page=138}}</ref> After graduation in 1987, he lived in [[Szolnok]] for two years, commuting to his job in Budapest as a sociologist at the Management Training Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food.<ref>{{citation |language = Hungarian|url = http://www.parlament.hu/kepv/eletrajz/hu/o320.pdf | title = Orbán Viktor |trans-title=Viktor Orban |type = biography |publisher = National Assembly |place = Hungary}}</ref>

In 1989, Orbán received a scholarship from the [[Open Society Foundations|Soros Foundation]] to study political science at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].<ref name="biography"/> His personal tutor was the [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] political philosopher [[Zbigniew Pełczyński]].<ref>{{citation |title = Fulbright report |url = http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/files/Fulbright_report.pdf |place = Oxford, United Kingdom |website = [[Rhodes House]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141215035740/http://files.www.rhodesscholarshiptrust.com/Fulbright_report.pdf |archivedate = 15 December 2014 }}</ref> In January 1990, he left Oxford and returned to Hungary to run for a seat in Hungary's first post-communist parliament.{{sfn|Paul Lendvai|2017|p=23}}

At the age of 14 and 15, he was a secretary of the communist youth organisation, [[Hungarian Young Communist League|KISZ]], of his secondary grammar school (KISZ membership was mandatory for university admittance).<ref>Pünkösti Árpád: Szeplőtelen fogantatás.

==Early career (1988–1998)==
[[File:Szárszói találkozó 1993 Fodor Gábor Orbán Viktor.jpg|thumb|right|Orbán and Gábor Fodor at the Szárszó meeting of 1993]]
On 30 March 1988, Orbán was one of the founding members of [[Fidesz]] (originally an acronym for ''Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége'', "Alliance of Young Democrats"){{sfn|Paul Lendvai|2017|p=21}} and served as its first spokesperson. The first members of the party, including Orbán, were mostly students from the Bibó István College for Advanced Studies who opposed the Communist regime.{{sfn|Paul Lendvai|2017|p=17–21}} At the college, itself a part of [[Eötvös Loránd University]],<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Schwartzburg|first1=Rosa|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/07/viktor-orban-fidesz-party-youth-activism|title=When Orbán Was a Liberal|date=24 July 2019|work=Jacobin|access-date=1 April 2020|url-status=live|last2=Szijarto|first2=Imre}}</ref> Orbán also co-founded the dissidenting social science journal ''Századvég''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=LeBor|first=Adam|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/09/11/how-hungary-prime-minister-turned-into-refugee-bashing-autocrat/|title=How Hungary's Prime Minister Turned From Young Liberal Into Refugee-Bashing Autocrat|date=11 September 2015|work=The Intercept|access-date=1 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 16 June 1989, Orbán gave a speech in [[Hősök tere|Heroes' Square]], Budapest, on the occasion of the reburial of [[Imre Nagy]] and other national [[martyr]]s of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Hungarian Revolution]]. In his speech, he demanded free elections and the withdrawal of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops. The speech brought him wide national and political acclaim. In summer 1989, he took part in the [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|opposition round table talks]], representing Fidesz alongside [[László Kövér]].{{sfn|Martens|2009|pp=192–93}}
[[File:Viktor Orbán 1997.jpg|thumb|left|Orbán in 1997 as leader of the opposition]]
On returning home from Oxford, he was elected Member of Parliament from his party's [[Pest County]] Regional List during the [[1990 Hungarian parliamentary election|1990 parliamentary election]]. He was appointed leader of the Fidesz's parliamentary group, serving in this capacity until May 1993.<ref name="Register">{{cite web|url=https://www.parlament.hu/web/guest/aktiv-kepviseloi-nevsor?p_p_id=hu_parlament_cms_pair_portlet_PairProxy_INSTANCE_9xd2Wc9jP4z8&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_auth=LAmTvTYj&_hu_parlament_cms_pair_portlet_PairProxy_INSTANCE_9xd2Wc9jP4z8_pairAction=%2Finternet%2Fcplsql%2Fogy_kpv.kepv_adat%3Fp_azon%3Do320%26p_stilus%3D%26p_head%3D|title=''Register'' |publisher=[[National Assembly of Hungary|Országgyűlés]]}}</ref>

On 18 April 1993, Orbán became the first president of Fidesz, replacing the national board that had served as a collective leadership since its founding. Under his leadership, Fidesz gradually transformed from a radical liberal student organization to a center-right people's party.<ref>[http://www.iie.com/publications/pb/pb15-11.pdf ''Hungary under Orbán: Can Central Planning Revive Its Economy?'', Simeon Djankov, Peterson Institute for International Economics, July 2015; accessed 20 January 2015.]</ref>

The conservative turn caused a severe split in the membership. Several members left the party, including [[Péter Molnár (academic)|Péter Molnár]], [[Gábor Fodor (politician)|Gábor Fodor]] and [[Zsuzsanna Szelényi]]. Fodor and others later joined the liberal [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ), initially a strong ally of Fidesz, but later a political opponent.<ref>Petőcz, György: ''Csak a narancs volt''. Irodalom Kft, 2001 {{ISBN|963-00-8876-2}}.</ref>

During the [[1994 Hungarian parliamentary election|1994 parliamentary election]], Fidesz barely reached the 5% threshold.<ref name="vida">{{cite book|author-last=Vida|author-first=István|title=Magyarországi politikai pártok lexikona (1846–2010) ''[Encyclopedia of the Political Parties in Hungary (1846–2010)]''|publisher=Gondolat Kiadó|year=2011|pages=346–350|chapter=|isbn=978-963-693-276-3|ref=harv|language=hu}}</ref> Orbán became MP from his party's Fejér County Regional List.<ref name="Register"/> He served as chairman of the Committee on European Integration Affairs between 1994 and 1998.<ref name="Register"/> He was also a member of the Immunity, Incompatibility and Credentials Committee for a short time in 1995.<ref name="Register"/> Under his presidency, Fidesz adopted "Hungarian Civic Party" (''Magyar Polgári Párt'') to its shortened name in 1995. His party gradually became dominant in the right-wing of the political spectrum, while the former ruling conservative [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] (MDF) had lost much of its support.<ref name="vida"/> From April 1996, Orbán was chairman of the Hungarian National Committee of the [[New Atlantic Initiative]] (NAI).<ref>[https://www.kormany.hu/hu/a-miniszterelnok/eletrajz Orbán Viktor életrajza], Government of Hungary, accessed 2020-04-04</ref>

In September 1992, Orbán was elected vice chairman of the [[Liberal International]].{{sfn|Paul Lendvai|2017|p=26}} In November 2000, however, Fidesz left the Liberal International and joined the [[European People's Party]] (EPP). During the time, Orbán worked hard to unite the center-right liberal conservative parties in Hungary. At the EPP's Congress in [[Estoril]] in October 2002, he was elected vice-president, an office he held until 2012.{{sfn|Martens|2009|p=193}}

==First term as Prime Minister (1998–2002)==
{{main|1998 Hungarian parliamentary election}}{{More citations needed|date=April 2020|section}}
In 1998, Orbán formed a successful coalition with the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] (MDF) and the [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|Independent Smallholders' Party]] (FKGP) and won the [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998 parliamentary elections]] with 42% of the national vote.{{sfn|Martens|2009|p=193}} Orbán became the second youngest Prime Minister of Hungary at the age of 35 (after [[András Hegedüs]]), serving between 1998 and 2002.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120325044232/http://zona.hu/article/2266/kormanyfoi-multidezes-a-jogaszok-a-nyerok.html Kormányfői múltidézés: a jogászok a nyerők], Zona.hu.</ref>

The new government immediately launched a radical reform of state administration, reorganizing ministries and creating a superministry for the economy. In addition, the boards of the social security funds and centralized social security payments were dismissed. Following the [[German model]], Orbán strengthened the Prime Minister's office and named a new minister to oversee the work of his Cabinet.<ref>[http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20011121stumpf.html Stumpf lesz a miniszterelnök-helyettes], ''Origo'', 21 November 2001; accessed 15 March 2014.</ref> In the process, thousands of civil servants were replaced (no distinction is made between political and civil servant posts, resulting in a strong "winner takes all" practice). The overall direction was towards centralized control.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

The year saw only minor changes in top government officials. Two of Orbán's state secretaries in the Prime Minister's office had to resign in May, due to their implication in a bribery scandal involving the American military manufacturer [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin Corporation]]. Before bids on a major jet-fighter contract, the two secretaries, along with 32 other deputies of Orbán's party, had sent a letter to two US senators to lobby for the appointment of a Budapest-based Lockheed manager to be the US ambassador to Hungary.<ref>[http://www.origo.hu/itthon/19990526orban.html Orbán nem gyanít korrupciót a Lockheed-botrány mögött], ''Origo'', 26 May 1999; accessed 24 July 2012.</ref> On 31 August, the head of the Tax Office also resigned, succumbing to protracted attacks by the opposition on his earlier, allegedly suspicious, business dealings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The tug-of-war between the Budapest City Council and the government continued over the government's decision in late 1998 to cancel two major urban projects: the construction of a [[National Theatre (Budapest)|new national theatre]]<ref>[http://www.nemzetiszinhaz.hu/torteneti_attekintes/ Történeti áttekintés] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913015719/http://www.nemzetiszinhaz.hu/torteneti_attekintes|date=13 September 2015}}, National Theatre; accessed 17 June 2018. {{in lang|hu}}.</ref> and of the [[Line 4 (Budapest Metro)|fourth subway line]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Relations between the Fidesz-led coalition government and the opposition worsened in the National Assembly, where the two seemed to have abandoned all attempts at consensus-seeking politics. The government pushed to swiftly replace the heads of key institutions (such as the [[Hungarian National Bank]] chairman, the [[Chief Prosecutor of Hungary|Budapest City Chief Prosecutor]] and the [[Magyar Rádió|Hungarian Radio]]) with partisan figures. Although the opposition resisted, for example by delaying their appointing of members of the supervising boards, the government ran the institutions without the stipulated number of directors. In a similar vein, Orbán failed to show up for question time in parliament, for periods of up to 10 months. His statements of the kind that "The parliament works without opposition too..." also contributed to the image of an arrogant and aggressive governance.<ref>[http://nol.hu/archivum/archiv-7602-3098 Népszabadság Archívum], Népszabadság; accessed 15 March 2014.</ref>

A later report in March by the Brussels-based [[International Federation of Journalists]] criticized the Hungarian government for improper political influence in the media, as the country's public service broadcaster teetered close to bankruptcy.<ref>[http://index.hu/belfold/media/ Nemzetközi Újságíró-szövetség vizsgálná a magyar médiát], Index, 13 January 2001; accessed 15 March 2014.</ref> Numerous political scandals during 2001 led to ''a de facto'', if not actual, breakup of the coalition that held power in Budapest. A bribery scandal in February triggered a wave of allegations and several prosecutions against the Independent Smallholders' Party. The affair resulted in the ousting of [[József Torgyán]] from both the FKGP presidency and the top post in the [[Ministry of Agriculture (Hungary)|Ministry of Agriculture]]. The FKGP disintegrated and more than a dozen of its MPs joined the government faction.<ref>[http://index.hu/belfold/torgyanlemon/ Torgyán lemondott], ''[[Index (Hungarian website)|Index]]'', 8 February 2001; accessed 15 March 2014.</ref>

===Economy===
Orbán's [[economic policy]] was aimed at cutting taxes and social insurance contributions over four years, while reducing inflation and unemployment. Among the new government's first measures was to abolish university [[Tuition payments|tuition fees]] and reintroduce universal maternity benefits. The government announced its intention to continue the Socialist–Liberal stabilization program and pledged to narrow the budget deficit, which had grown to 4.5% of GDP.<ref name="economyOrbanI">[http://fn.hir24.hu/velemeny/2012/02/12/igy-kormanyoztak-a-magyar-gazdasagot/ Gazdag, László: Így kormányozták a magyar gazdaságot], ''FN.hu'', 12 February 2012; accessed 15 March 2014.</ref> The previous Cabinet had almost completed the privatization of government-run industries and had launched a comprehensive pension reform. However, the Socialists had avoided two major socioeconomic issues—reform of health care and agriculture, these remained to be tackled by Orbán's government.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Economic successes included a drop in inflation from 15% in 1998 to 10.0% in 1999, 9.8% in 2000 and 7.8% in 2001. GDP growth rates were fairly steady: 4.4% in 1999, 5.2% in 2000, and 3.8% in 2001. The fiscal deficit fell from 3.9% in 1999, to 3.5% in 2000 and 3.4% in 2001 and the ratio of the national debt decreased to 54% of GDP.<ref name="economyOrbanI"/> Under the Orbán cabinet, there were realistic hopes that Hungary would be able to join the [[Eurozone]] by 2009. However, negotiations for entry into the [[European Union]] slowed in the fall of 1999, after the EU included six more countries (in addition to the original six) in the accession discussions. Orbán repeatedly criticized the EU for its delay.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Orbán also came under criticism for pushing through an unprecedented two-year budget and for failing to curb inflation, which only dropped a half point, from 10% in 1999 to 9.5% in 2000, despite the tight monetary policy of the Central Bank. However, investments continued to grow.<ref>[http://www.origo.hu/gazdasag/hirek/20000721145649OFLR.html Kétéves költségvetés készül a PM-ben], Origo, 31 July 2001; accessed 15 March 2014.</ref>

Hungary attracted international media attention in 1999 for passing the "status law" concerning estimated three-million ethnic Hungarian minorities in neighbouring [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Ukraine]]. The law aimed to provide education, health benefits and employment rights to those, and was said to heal the negative effects of the disastrous 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon Treaty]].<ref>Michael Toomey, "History, nationalism and democracy: myth and narrative in Viktor Orbán’s ‘illiberal Hungary’."

Governments in neighbouring states, particularly Romania, claimed to be insulted by the law, which they saw as an interference in their domestic affairs. The proponents of the status law countered that several of the countries criticizing the law themselves have similar constructs to provide benefits for their own minorities. Romania acquiesced after amendments following a December 2001 agreement between Orbán and [[Prime Minister of Romania|Romanian Prime Minister]] [[Adrian Năstase]];<ref>[http://itthon.transindex.ro/?cikk=522 Nastase-Orbán egyezség készül a státustörvényről], ''[[Transindex]]'', 17 December 2001; accessed 15 March 2014.</ref> Slovakia accepted the law after further concessions made by the new government after the 2002 elections.<ref>[http://www.kbdesign.sk/cla/projects/comparative_statuslaw/cla_analysis/Statusz_Monitoring_May_2002.htm A magyar státustörvény fogadtatása és alkalmazása a Szlovák Köztársaságban], ''Center for Legal Analyses-Kalligram Foundation''; accessed 15 March 2014.</ref>

==Leader of the Opposition (2002–2010)==
{{main|2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2006 Hungarian parliamentary election}}{{More citations needed|date=April 2020|section}}
The level of public support for political parties generally stagnated, even with general elections coming in 2002. Fidesz and the main opposition [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] (MSZP) ran neck and neck in the opinion polls for most of the year, both attracting about 26% of the electorate. According to a September 2001 poll by the Gallup organization, however, support for a joint Fidesz – Hungarian Democratic Forum party list would run up to 33% of the voters, with the Socialists drawing 28% and other opposition parties 3% each.<ref>[http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20011115gallup.html Gallup: nőtt a Fidesz-MDF közös lista előnye], Origo, 15 November 2001; accessed 15 March 2014.</ref>

Meanwhile, public support for the FKGP plunged from 14% in 1998 to 1% in 2001. As many as 40% of the voters remained undecided, however. Although the Socialists had picked their candidate for Prime Minister—former finance minister [[Péter Medgyessy]]—the opposition largely remained unable to increase its political support.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The dark horse of the election was the radical nationalist [[Hungarian Justice and Life Party]] (MIÉP), with its leader, [[István Csurka]]'s radical rhetoric. MIÉP could not be ruled out as the key to a new term for Orbán and his party, should they be forced into a coalition after the 2002 elections.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The elections of 2002 were the most heated Hungary had experienced in more than a decade, and an unprecedented cultural-political division formed in the country. In the event, Viktor Orbán's group lost the April parliamentary elections to the opposition Hungarian Socialist Party, which set up a coalition with its longtime ally, the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats. Turnout was a record-high 70.5%. Beyond these parties, only deputies of the Hungarian Democratic Forum made it into the National Assembly. The populist Independent Smallholders' Party and the right Hungarian Justice and Life Party lost all their seats. Thus, the number of political parties in the new assembly was reduced from six to four.<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen]] & Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p. 899 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref>

MIÉP challenged the government's legitimacy, demanded a recount, complained of election fraud, and generally kept the country in election mode until the October municipal elections. The socialist-controlled Central Elections Committee ruled that a recount was unnecessary, a position supported by observers from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], whose only substantive criticism of the election conduct was that the state television carried a consistent bias in favour of Fidesz.<ref>[http://index.hu/belfold/csurka0422/ A MIÉP cselekvésre szólít a 'csalás' miatt], Index, 22 April 2002; accessed 15 March 2014.</ref>

Orbán received the Freedom Award of the [[American Enterprise Institute]] and the New Atlantic Initiative (2001), the Polak Award (2001), the [[National Order of Merit (France)|Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit]] (2001), the "Förderpreis Soziale Marktwirtschaft" (Price for the Social Market Economy, 2002) and the Mérite Européen prize (2004). In April 2004, he received the Papal Grand Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great.

In the [[2004 European Parliament election in Hungary|2004 European Parliament election]], the ruling Hungarian Socialist Party was heavily defeated by the opposition conservative Fidesz. Fidesz gained 47.4% of the vote and 12 of Hungary's 24 seats.<ref>{{cite news |first=Péter |last=Hack |title=A vereség tanulságai |url=http://www.hetek.hu/fokusz/200406/a_vereseg_tanulsagai |magazine=[[Hetek (magazine)|Hetek]] |date=18 June 2004 |accessdate=19 March 2019 |language=Hungarian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=A Fidesz győzött, és a legnagyobb európai frakció tagja lesz |url=https://24.hu/kulfold/2004/06/14/fidesz_gy_337_zott/ |website=24.hu |date=14 June 2004 |accessdate=19 March 2019 |language=Hungarian}}</ref>

Orbán was the Fidesz candidate for the [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|parliamentary election in 2006]]. Fidesz and its new-old candidate failed again to gain a majority in this election, which initially put Orbán's future political career as the leader of Fidesz in question.<ref>{{citation|language=Hungarian|url=http://www.valasztas.hu/parval2006/main_hu.html|title=Országos Választási Iroda – 2006 Országgyűlési Választások eredményei|trans-title=National Election Office – 2006 parliamentary elections|publisher=Valasztas}}</ref> However, after fighting with Socialist-Liberal coalition, Orbán's position solidified again, and he was elected president of Fidesz yet again for another term in May 2007.<ref>[http://www.politaktika.hu/hirek/ismet_orban_viktor_a_fidesz_elnoke Ismét Orbán Viktor lett a Fidesz elnöke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325034826/http://www.politaktika.hu/hirek/ismet_orban_viktor_a_fidesz_elnoke|date=25 March 2012}} Politaktika.hu; accessed 12 April 2018.</ref>

On 17 September 2006, an audio recording surfaced from a closed-door Hungarian Socialist Party meeting, which was held on 26 May 2006, in which Hungarian Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]] gave [[Őszöd speech|an obscenity-laden speech]]. The leak ignited [[2006 protests in Hungary|mass protests]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} On 1 November, Orbán and his party announced their plans to stage several large-scale demonstrations across Hungary on the anniversary of the Soviet suppression of the 1956 Revolution. The events were intended to serve as a memorial to the victims of the Soviet invasion and a protest against police brutality during the 23 October unrest in Budapest. Planned events included a candlelight vigil march across Budapest.

On 1 October 2006, Fidesz won the municipal elections, which counterbalanced the MSZP-led government's power to some extent. Fidesz won 15 of 23 mayoralties in Hungary's largest cities—although it narrowly lost Budapest to the Liberal Party—and majorities in 18 of 20 regional assemblies.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vokscentrum.hu/onkorm/elemzo.php?jny=hun&mszkod=860001&mitmut=polgmjv|title=Vokscentrum – a választások univerzuma|publisher=Vokscentrum.hu|year=2006|accessdate=17 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818083027/http://www.vokscentrum.hu/onkorm/elemzo.php?jny=hun&mszkod=860001&mitmut=polgmjv|archivedate=18 August 2007}}</ref><ref name=OctElects06>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2006/10/03/2003330242|title=Opposition makes substantial gains in Hungarian elections|newspaper=[[Taipei Times]]|date=3 October 2006|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref>

On 9 March 2008, a [[2008 Hungarian fees abolition referendum|national referendum]] took place on revoking government reforms which introduced doctor fees per visit and medical fees paid per number of days spent in hospital as well as tuition fees in higher education.

According to ''[[Politico]]'', Orbán's political philosophy "echoes the resentments of what were once the peasant and working classes" by promoting an "uncompromising defense of [[Westphalian sovereignty|national sovereignty]] and a transparent distrust of Europe's ruling establishments".<ref name="Politico"/>

Orbán has a close relationship to [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], having known him for decades. He is described as "one of Mr Netanyahu's closest allies in Europe."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21726995-jewish-state-chooses-its-battles-carefully-binyamin-netanyahu-soft|title=Binyamin Netanyahu is soft on anti-Semitism when it suits him|magazine=The Economist|accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref> Orbán received personal advice on economic reforms from Netanyahu, while the latter was [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|Finance Minister of Israel]] (2003–2005).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=44027|title=Hungarian PM: We share the same security concerns as Israel|newspaper=[[Israel Hayom]]|accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref> In February 2019, Netanyahu thanked Orbán for "deciding to extend the embassy of Hungary in Israel to [[Jerusalem]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=Hungary to open office with 'diplomatic status' in Jerusalem |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/hungary-to-open-office-with-diplomatic-status-in-jerusalem/ |work=The Times of Israel |date=19 February 2019}}</ref>

Orbán is seen as having laid out his political views most concretely in a widely cited 2014 public address at [[Băile Tușnad]] (known in Hungary as the ''Tusnádfürdői beszéd,'' or "Tusnádfürdő speech"). In the address, Orbán repudiated the classical liberal theory of the state as a free association of [[Atomism (social)|atomistic]] [[Individualism|individuals]], arguing for the use of the state as the means of organizing, invigorating, or even constructing the [[Nation|national community]]. Although this kind of state respects traditionally liberal concepts like [[Human rights|civic rights]], it is properly called "[[Illiberal democracy|illiberal]]" because it views the community, and not the individual, as the basic political unit.<ref name="Hungarian Government">{{cite news|last=Orbán|first=Viktor|title=Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's speech at the 25th Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp|url=http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/the-prime-minister-s-speeches/prime-minister-viktor-orban-s-speech-at-the-25th-balvanyos-summer-free-university-and-student-camp|website=[[Government of Hungary]]|accessdate=9 May 2016}}</ref> In practice, Orbán claimed, such a state should promote [[Autarky|national self-sufficiency]], national sovereignty, [[familialism]], [[full employment]] and the preservation of [[cultural heritage]], and cited countries such as [[Turkey]], [[India]], [[Singapore]], Russia, and [[China]] as models.<ref name="Hungarian Government"/>

Orbán's second and third premierships have been the subject of significant international controversy, and reception of his political views is mixed. The 2011 constitutional changes enacted under his leadership were, in particular, accused of centralizing legislative and executive power, curbing civil liberties, restricting freedom of speech, and weakening the [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]] and judiciary.<ref>{{cite news|title=Q&A: Hungary's controversial constitutional changes|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21748878|accessdate=9 May 2016|website=[[BBC]]|date=11 March 2013}}</ref> For these reasons, critics have described him as "[[Irredentism|irredentist]]",<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pack|first1=Jason|title=The Hungary model: Resurgent nationalism|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-hungary-model-resurgent-nationalism-14025|magazine=[[The National Interest]]|accessdate=9 May 2016}}</ref> "[[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]]",<ref>{{cite news|title=Playing with fear|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21679792-america-and-europe-right-wing-populist-politicians-are-march-threat|accessdate=9 May 2016|magazine=The Economist|date=12 December 2015}}</ref> "[[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/moment/2014/10/viktor_orban_s_authoritarian_rule_the_hungarian_prime_minister_is_destroying.html|last1=Schliefer|first1=Yigal|title=Hungary at the turning point|accessdate=9 May 2016|magazine=[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]], [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=October 2014}}</ref> "[[Autocracy|autocratic]]",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/05/03/hungary-is-backsliding-what-is-the-european-parliament-doing-about-this|title=Analysis – Hungary's government is increasingly autocratic.

Other commentators, however, noted that the European migrant crisis, coupled with continued [[Islamic terrorism|Islamist]] [[Terrorism in Europe|terrorism in the European Union]], have popularized Orbán's nationalist, protectionist policies among European conservative leaders. "Once ostracized" by Europe's political elite, writes ''Politico'', Orbán "is now the talisman of Europe's mainstream right".<ref name="Politico"/> As other Visegrád Group leaders, Orbán opposes any [[European migrant crisis#Reactions|compulsory EU long-term quota]] on redistribution of migrants.<ref>Traynor, Ian.

He wrote in the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'': "Europe's response is madness. We must acknowledge that the European Union's misguided immigration policy is responsible for this situation".<ref>{{cite news|title=Migration crisis: Hungary PM says Europe in grip of madness |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/03/migration-crisis-hungary-pm-victor-orban-europe-response-madness |newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 September 2015}}</ref> He also demanded an official EU list of "safe countries" to which migrants can be returned.<ref>"[https://news.yahoo.com/hungary-pm-rejects-merkels-moral-imperialism-refugee-crisis-130722708.html Hungary PM rejects Merkel's 'moral imperialism' in refugee crisis]", [[Yahoo!

Orbán has promoted [[the Great Replacement]] conspiracy theory. ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]'' reported on Orbán's explicit adoption of the conspiracy theory, after he claimed; "if we let tens of millions of migrants travel to Europe from [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]... the young people of Western Europe will know the day when they will be in a minority in their own country".<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.lejdd.fr/politique/wauquiez-nest-pas-gene-par-aucun-de-ces-propos-de-orban-sur-limmigration-3760298 |title=Wauquiez is not "embarrassed" by Viktor Orban's speech on immigration |date=12 July 2017 | newspaper = Le Journal du Dimanche}}</ref>

During a press conference in January 2019, Orbán praised [[President of Brazil|Brazil's president]] [[Jair Bolsonaro]], saying that currently "the most apt definition of modern [[Christian democracy]] can be found in Brazil, not in Europe."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/3e0d443c759f494e9c2249d9041a4d75|title='Hungary's Orban wants anti-migration forces to control EU|first=Pablo|last=Gorondi|date=10 January 2019|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

Despite the anti-immigration rhetoric from Orbán, it has been reported that Hungary has actually increased immigration of foreign workers into the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/hungary-loudly-opposed-to-immigration-opens-doors-to-more-foreign-workers-11567944008|title=Hungary, Loudly Opposed to Immigration, Opens Doors to More Foreign Workers|last=Hungary|first=Bojan Pancevski in Budapest and Adam Bihari in Mór|website=WSJ|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://hungarytoday.hu/immigration-foreigners-hungary-work-growing/|title=Number of Foreigners Coming to Hungary to Work Growing|last=Vass|first=Ábrahám|date=24 September 2019|website=Hungary Today|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/19841/in-orban-s-hungary-more-migrants-due-to-labor-shortage|title=In Orban's Hungary, more migrants due to labor shortage|date=30 September 2019|website=InfoMigrants|language=en}}</ref>

As stated by ''[[The Guardian]]'', the "Hungarian government doubled family spending between 2010 and 2019", intending to achieve "a lasting turn in demographic processes by 2030". Orbán has espoused an anti-immigration platform, and has also advocated for increased investment into "Family First". Orbán has disregarded the European Union's attempts to promote integration as a key solution to population distribution problems in Europe. He has also supported investments into the country's low birth rates. Orbán has tapped into the "great replacement theory" which emulates a [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] approach to rejecting foreign immigration out of fear of replacement by immigrants. He has stated that "If Europe is not going to be populated by Europeans in the future and we take this as given, then we are speaking about an exchange of populations, to replace the population of Europeans with others." The Guardian stated that "This year the Hungarian government introduced a 10 million [[forint]] (£27,000) interest-free loan for families, which does not have to be paid back if the couple has three children."<ref>{{cite news |last= Walker |first= Shaun |title= Viktor Orbán trumpets Hungary's 'procreation, not immigration' policy |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/viktor-orban-trumpets-far-right-procreation-anti-immigration-policy |date= 6 September 2019 |newspaper= The Guardian |access-date= 3 May 2020}}</ref>

In July 2020, Orbán expressed that he still expects arguments over linking of disbursement of funds of the [[European Union]] to rule-of-law criteria, but marked in a state radio interview that they “didn’t win the war, we (they) won an important battle”.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-24/orban-says-he-won-battle-not-war-over-rule-of-law-at-eu-summit| title=Viktor Orban Expects More Battles Over Rule of Law| accessdate= 24 July 2020|website=Bloomberg}}</ref> In August 2020, Orbán whilst speaking at an event to inaugurate a monument commemorating the Treaty of Trianon, said Central European nations should come together to preserve their Christian roots as western Europe experiments with same-sex families, immigration and atheism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/hungary-s-orban-calls-central-europe-unite-around-christian-roots-n1237460|title=Hungary's Orban calls for central Europe to unite around Christian roots|accessdate=20 August 2020|website=NBC News}}</ref>

Some opposition parties and critics also consider Orbán an opponent of European integration. In 2000, opposition parties MSZP and SZDSZ and the left-wing press presented Orbán's comment that "there's life outside the EU" as proof of his [[anti-Europeanism]] and sympathies with the [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Orbán: van élet az EU-n kívül is |url=http://ujszo.com/cimkek/regi-online-kiadas/2002/02/01/orban-van-elet-az-eu-n-kivul-is |newspaper=[[Új Szó]] |date=1 February 2002 |accessdate=19 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111225618/https://ujszo.com/cimkek/regi-online-kiadas/2002/02/01/orban-van-elet-az-eu-n-kivul-is |archivedate=11 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://hu.wikiquote.org/wiki/Orb%C3%A1n_Viktor#Id.C3.A9zetek.2C_1998_-_2001|title=Orbán Viktor – Wikidézet|website= Wikiquote |accessdate=30 September 2017|language=Hungarian}}</ref> In the same press conference, Orbán clarified that "[w]e're trying to make the accession fast because it may boost the growth of Hungary's economy".{{citation needed |date=April 2018}}

Hungarian-American business magnate and political activist [[George Soros]] criticized Orbán's handling of the European migrant crisis in 2015, saying: "His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle."<ref>"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-30/orban-accuses-soros-of-stoking-refugee-wave-to-weaken-europe "Orbán accuses Soros of stoking refugee wave to weaken Europe"], Bloomberg, 30 October 2015.</ref>

The Orbán government began to attack Soros and his NGOs since early 2017, particularly for his support for more open immigration. In July 2017, the Israeli ambassador in Hungary joined Jewish groups and others in denouncing a billboard campaign backed by the government. Orbán's critics claimed it "evokes memories of the Nazi posters during the [[World War II|Second World War]]". The ambassador stated that the campaign "evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear", an apparent reference to the Holocaust.
