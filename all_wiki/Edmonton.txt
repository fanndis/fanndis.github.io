The coming of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) to southern Alberta in 1885 helped the Edmonton economy, and the 1891 building of the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway|Calgary and Edmonton (C&E) Railway]] resulted in the emergence of a railway townsite (South Edmonton/Strathcona) on the river's south side, across from Edmonton. The arrival of the CPR and the C&E Railway helped bring settlers and entrepreneurs from eastern Canada, Europe, U.S. and other parts of the world. The Edmonton area's fertile soil and cheap land attracted settlers, further establishing Edmonton as a major regional commercial and agricultural centre. Some people participating in the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] passed through South Edmonton/Strathcona in 1897. Strathcona was North America's northernmost railway point, but travel to the Klondike was still very difficult for the "Klondikers," and a majority of them took a [[Steamboat|steamship]] north to the [[Yukon]] from [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Monto|first=Tom|title=Old Strathcona: Edmonton's Southside Roots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkFstwAACAAJ&pg=PP1|year=2011|publisher=Crang|isbn=978-1-895097-13-9 }}</ref>

=== History of municipal governance ===
[[File:City-Hall-Edmonton-Alberta-2A.jpg|thumb|[[Edmonton City Hall]] is the home of the [[Edmonton City Council|municipal government]] for Edmonton.|alt=|left]]
In 1892 Edmonton was incorporated as a town. The first mayor was [[Matthew McCauley (politician)|Matthew McCauley]], who established the first school board in Edmonton and Board of Trade (later Chamber of Commerce) and a municipal police service.<ref name="Edmonton Politics">{{Cite book|last=Walls|first=Martha|title=Edmonton Book of Everything|publisher=Maclntyre Purcell Publishing Inc.|year=2007|page=129|isbn=978-0-9738063-4-2}}</ref> Due to McCauley's good relationship with the federal Liberals, Edmonton maintained economic and political prominence over [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]], a rival town on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River.<ref name="Edmonton Politics"/> Edmonton was incorporated as a city in 1904 and became Alberta's capital in 1905.

In 1904, the City of Edmonton purchased the [[Edmonton District Telephone Company]] for $17,000 from [[Alex Taylor (businessman)]], a Canadian entrepreneur, inventor, and politician. Amalgamated into a city department as City of Edmonton Telephone Department, City Telephone System (CTS), 'edmonton telephones'. In 1989, City Council voted to create [[Edmonton Telephones Corporation]] to operate as an autonomous organization under a board of directors appointed by the city. In 1995, City of Edmonton ownership of its telephone service ended when ED TEL was sold to the Telus corporation. City Bylaw 11713 created The Ed Tel Endowment Fund whereas the shares owned by Edmonton Telephones Corporation in Ed Tel Inc. were sold by the City of Edmonton to Telus on March 10, 1995 for $470,221,872 to be invested for the perpetual benefit of Edmontonians.

Unions and radical organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World struggled for progressive social change through the early years, with the first reformer, [[James East]], elected in 1912, followed by the first official Labour alderman, [[James Kinney]], the following year. Many thousands of workers participated in the Edmonton general strike of 1919 and a strong block of Labour representatives were on council after the next election: East, Kinney, Sam McCoppen, [[Rice Sheppard]] and [[Joseph Clarke (Canadian politician)|Joe Clarke]].

The City used [[Single Transferable Vote]] (STV), a form of proportional representation, for elections from 1923 to 1927, in which councillors were elected at large with ranked transferable votes.

Labour representation on city council became a near-majority in 1929, and a full majority from 1932 to 1934, during the Great Depression.{{sfnp|Monto|2011|pp=433, 164}} Jan Reimer became the city's first female mayor when she was elected in 1989.{{sfnp|Monto|2011|p=326}}<ref>Monto, Tom, Protest and Progress, Three Labour Radicals in Early Edmonton, Crang Publishing (available at Alhambra Books, Edmonton), 2012, 71–76</ref>

Downtown Edmonton has undergone a continual process of renewal and growth since the mid-1990s. Many buildings were demolished during the oil boom, starting in the 1960s and continuing into the 1980s, to make way for office towers. There have always been numerous pub-type establishments, hotel lounges, and restaurants. The past decade has seen a strong resurgence in more mainstream venues. Edmonton also has a high demand for pub crawl tours in the city. Various clubs are found along Edmonton's main street, Jasper Avenue. The Edmonton City Centre mall also houses a [[Landmark Cinemas]] movie theatre with nine screens.

{{See also|North Saskatchewan River valley parks system}}
Edmonton's river valley constitutes the longest stretch of connected urban parkland in North America, and Edmonton has the highest amount of parkland per capita of any Canadian city; the river valley is 22 times larger than New York City's [[Central Park]].<ref name="River Valley">{{cite web |url=http://www.edmonton.com/for-visitors/scenic-settings.aspx |author=Edmonton's Official Tourism Website |title=Scenic Settings  |publisher=Edmonton Economic Development Corporation |access-date=May 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025214420/http://edmonton.com/for-visitors/scenic-settings.aspx |archive-date=October 25, 2013}}</ref> The river valley is home to various parks ranging from fully serviced urban parks to campsite-like facilities with few amenities.

== Government ==
=== City council ===
The Edmonton City Council consists of a mayor and twelve councillors serving four-year terms. Each councillor is elected in a ward (electoral district); the mayor is elected at-large. The elections are non-partisan. Council has the responsibility of approving the city's budget, and develops laws and policies intended to promote the health and safety of Edmonton residents. The Council passes all legislation related to the city's police, firefighting, parks, libraries, and electricity, water supply, solid waste, and drainage utilities.

On July 22, 2009, City Council adopted an electoral system that divides Edmonton into 12 wards, instead of the previous two for each of six wards. This system came into effect with the [[2010 Edmonton municipal election|following election]] in October 2010.<ref name="Ward System">{{cite web|url=http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/municipal_elections/ward-system.aspx |title=Ward System |date=July 22, 2009 |publisher=City of Edmonton |access-date=August 5, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922064953/http://edmonton.ca/city_government/municipal_elections/ward-system.aspx |archive-date=September 22, 2010 }}</ref> The [[2017 Edmonton municipal election|most recent election]] was held in October 2017, and elected members to a four-year term.

=== Provincial politics ===
[[File:AlbertaLegislature.jpg|thumb|Edmonton is home to the [[Alberta Legislature Building]], the meeting place for the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]].]]
Edmonton is the capital of the province of Alberta and holds all main provincial areas of government such as the [[Legislature of Alberta|Provincial Legislature of Alberta]].
