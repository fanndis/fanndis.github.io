'''Hancock Prospecting''' is a leading [[Australia]]n owned mining and agricultural business run by [[Executive Chairman]] [[Gina Rinehart]] and [[CEO]] Garry Korte.

Established in 1955, the company is [[chairwoman|chaired]] by [[Gina Rinehart]], estimated to be the wealthiest person in Australia, and the daughter of the company's founder, the late [[Lang Hancock]]. Upon resuming the Executive Chairmanship, Mrs Rinehart took over a company that was in a perilous financial position with significant debt and major assets mortgages and under threat of seizure.

Hancock holds the [[Mineral rights|rights]] to some of the largest [[Crown land|land]] [[leases]] in the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]], containing the world's largest [[iron ore]] deposit.

It is owned by Gina Rinehart (76.6%) and the Hope Margaret Hancock Trust (23.4%).<ref name="Hannah Low">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/think-very-carefully-gina-rineharts-daughter-hope-welker-warned-by-lawyer-20140513-386dn.html|title='Think very carefully': Gina Rinehart's daughter Hope Welker warned by lawyer|date=13 May 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|author=Hannah Low}}</ref>

In August 2016, former politician [[Sophie Mirabella]] is now the general manager of media relations for this company.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/former-liberal-frontbencher-sophie-mirabella-goes-to-work-for-gina-rinehart-20160812-gqr4fb.html |title = Former Liberal frontbencher Sophie Mirabella goes to work for Gina Rinehart|date = 12 August 2016}}</ref>

==Activities==
The Hancock Group of Companies are holders of numerous iron ore leases in the Pilbara. The leases cover an area of {{convert|500|km2}} predominantly in the Central Pilbara region and contain mineable reserves of Brockman and Marra Mamba ore of over 850 million tonnes. Leases in the Eastern Pilbara region contain mineable reserves of Marra Mamba ore of over 2 billion tonnes, and over 500 million tonnes of [[manganese|ferruginous manganese]] in their [[Nicholas Downs mine|Nicholas Downs Project]],<ref name="HPPL-ND"/> which is a [[joint venture]] with mining services company [[Mineral Resources Limited]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hancockprospecting.com.au/go/current-projects/hope-downs-jv |title=Hope Downs Iron Ore Project |work=Current projects |publisher=Hancock Prospecting |year=2012 |access-date=23 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320133315/http://hancockprospecting.com.au/go/current-projects/hope-downs-jv |archive-date=20 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/07/18/1026898888036.html |title=Hancock strikes it hot on Hope Downs iron ore |first=Yvonne |last=Ball |date=19 July 2002 |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=23 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.riotinto.com/media/5157_3466.asp |title=Hope Downs mine development application submitted |date=16 March 2006 |publisher=Rio Tinto |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715190123/http://www.riotinto.com/media/5157_3466.asp |archive-date=15 July 2011}}</ref>

In 2011, the company was estimated to be earning about A$870 million in revenue per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcompany.com.au/wealth/20110207-the-great-resources-rush.html|title=Gina Rinehart's great resources rush|date=7 February 2011|author=Thomson, James|work=SmartCompany|access-date=2 February 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417061616/http://www.smartcompany.com.au/wealth/20110207-the-great-resources-rush.html|archive-date=17 April 2012}}</ref> This is based on a 50% share of profits generated at the Hope Downs mine which is operated by [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]]. Hope Downs production levels of 30 million tonnes per year and current prices (around [[United States dollar|US$]]140 per tonne) generate over A$2 billion in revenue, and about A$700 million in net cash. In addition, the company receives a 1.25% royalty from iron ore sales by [[Hamersley Iron]] (a Rio Tinto subsidiary) which delivers about A$170 million a year.

Hancock Prospecting exploration activities are done under the Jacaranda Alliance, a joint venture between Hancock, Minerals Australia Pty Ltd, and several former executives of Rio Tinto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hancockprospecting.com.au/go/current-projects/jacaranda-alliance |title=Jacaranda Alliance |work=Current projects |publisher=Hancock Prospecting |year=2012 |access-date=23 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320135653/http://hancockprospecting.com.au/go/current-projects/jacaranda-alliance |archive-date=20 March 2012}}</ref> Exploration and evaluation work on uranium, molybdenum, lead, zinc, gold, diamonds and petroleum deposits are conducted in Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and South East Asia.

As of 2016, Hancock Prospecting began to diversify its interests into the cattle industry, acquiring 67% of [[S. Kidman & Co]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Morrison approves Rinehart's cattle empire purchase|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-09/s-kidman-and-co-sale-to-rinehart-approved/8106694|accessdate=23 November 2017|work=ABC News|date=9 December 2016|language=en-AU}}</ref>

At stages of its trading, the company has been known as Hancock Prospecting Ltd, Hancock Resources, Hanwright Pty Ltd, Hancock & Wright Ltd, and Hancock Prospecting Pty. Ltd.

Hancock Prospecting significantly funds the [[Institute of Public Affairs]] (IPA), paying the IPA $2.3 million in financial year 2016 and $2.2 million in financial year 2017,<ref name=":13">{{Cite web|url=https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/5b4d22a6e4b0b9ab4020dda9|title=Rinehart v Rinehart - NSW Caselaw|website=www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au|url-status=|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref> which represents one-third to a half of the IPA's total revenue in those years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.desmogblog.com/2018/07/17/billionaire-mining-magnate-gina-rinehart-revealed-key-donor-australian-climate-science-denial-promoter-institute|title=Billionaire Mining Magnate Gina Rinehart Revealed As Key Donor to Australian Climate Science Denial Promoter Institute of Public Affairs|work=DeSmogBlog|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}</ref> These payments were not disclosed in IPA annual reports,<ref name=":4">{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnews%2Fnsw%2Fbid-to-involve-barnaby-joyce-an-attempt-to-embarrass-former-deputy-pm-says-magnate%2Fnews-story%2F6869c1d198e242ef97eea7bc4b3094fb&usg=AOvVaw2iG7P0aCiF9q2KBaJNWBcQ|title=Bid to involve Barnaby Joyce an attempt to embarrass former deputy PM, says magnate|date=6 July 2018|accessdate=6 July 2018|publisher=dailytelgraph.com.au|location=Sydney}}</ref> and Rinehart's daughter [[Bianca Hope Heyward]] submitted in court that the Hancock Prospecting payments were credited to Rinehart in an individual capacity.<ref name=":13" /> Gina Rinehart was made a life member of the IPA in November 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ginarinehart.com.au/mrs-rinehart-made-honorary-life-member-institute-public-affairs-ipa/|title=Mrs. Rinehart made an Honorary Life Member of the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA)|last=Rinehart|first=Gina|website=Gina Rinehart|url-status=}}</ref>

In an agreement reached between the parties, the Court granted an interim non-publication order in September 2011. In making the interim order, [[Judge|Justice]] Paul Brereton stated: "This is not the first occasion of discord in the family, which has immense wealth, no small part of which resides in the trust.
