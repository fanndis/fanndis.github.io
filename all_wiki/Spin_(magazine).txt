'''''Spin''''' (often stylized in all caps) is an American [[music magazine]] founded in 1985 by publisher [[Bob Guccione, Jr.]] The magazine stopped running in print in 2012 and currently runs as a [[Online magazine|webzine]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Publishers bring 195 new magazines to print in 2012 despite ongoing digital push|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/10/3751472/publishers-launch-195-new-print-magazines|access-date=February 14, 2014|newspaper=The Verge|date=December 10, 2012|author=Chris Welch}}</ref> owned by NEXT Management.

== History ==
''Spin'' was established in 1985.<ref name=zara>{{cite news|author=Christopher Zara|title=In Memoriam: Magazines We Lost In 2012|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/memoriam-magazines-we-lost-2012-956388|access-date=November 8, 2014|work=International Business Times|date=December 22, 2012}}</ref> In its early years, the magazine was known for its narrow music coverage with an emphasis on [[college rock]], [[grunge]], [[indie rock]], and the ongoing emergence of [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], while virtually ignoring other genres, such as country, and metal. It pointedly provided a national alternative to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' more establishment-oriented style. ''Spin'' prominently placed newer artists such as [[R.E.M.]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[Eurythmics]], [[Beastie Boys]], and [[Talking Heads]] on its covers and did lengthy features on established figures such as [[Duran Duran]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Tom Waits]], and [[John Lee Hooker]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Bull|first=Bart|title=Messin' with the Hook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdLsQBjl0-IC&pg=PA50 |access-date=May 29, 2012|newspaper=Spin|date=April 2006}}</ref>—[[Bart Bull]]'s article on Hooker won the magazine its first major award.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}

On a cultural level, the magazine devoted significant coverage to [[hardcore punk|punk]], [[alternative country]], [[electronica]], [[reggae]] and [[world music]], [[experimental rock]], [[jazz]] of the most adventurous sort, burgeoning [[underground music]] scenes, and a variety of fringe styles. Artists such as the [[Ramones]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[X (American band)|X]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], and the former members of the [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], and the early [[punk rock|punk]] and [[New wave music|New Wave]] movements were heavily featured in ''Spin''{{'}}s editorial mix. ''Spin''{{'}}s extensive coverage of [[Hip hop music|hip-hop music]] and [[Hip hop|culture]], especially that of contributing editor [[John Leland (journalist)|John Leland]], was notable at the time.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Editorial contributions by musical and cultural figures included [[Lydia Lunch]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[David Lee Roth]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]]. The magazine also reported on cities such as [[Austin, Texas]], or [[Glasgow]], Scotland, as cultural incubators in the independent music scene. A 1990 article on the contemporary [[country blues]] scene brought [[R. L. Burnside]] to national attention for the first time.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Coverage of American cartoonists, Japanese [[manga]], [[monster trucks]], the AIDS crisis, outsider artists, ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', and other non-mainstream cultural phenomena distinguished the magazine's dynamic early years.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In late 1987, publisher Bob Guccione Jr.'s father, [[Bob Guccione|Bob Guccione Sr.]], abruptly shut the magazine down despite the fact that the two-year-old magazine was widely considered a success, with a newsstand circulation of 150,000.{{citation needed|date=August 2008}}  Guccione Jr. was able to rally much of his staff, partner with former MTV president and David H. Horowitz, locate additional new investors and offices and after missing a month's publication, returned with a combined November–December issue. During this time, it was published by Camouflage Associates. In 1997, Guccione sold ''Spin'' to Miller Publishing.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1994, two journalists working for the magazine were [[1994 roadside attack on Spin magazine journalists|killed by a landmine]] while reporting on the [[Bosnian War]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. A third, [[William T. Vollmann]], was injured.

===Later years ===
In February 2006, Miller Publishing sold the magazine to a San Francisco-based company called the McEvoy Group LLC, which was also the owner of [[Chronicle Books]].<ref name="spin">{{cite news|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|access-date=October 17, 2007|title=S.F. group buys 20-year-old rock music magazine Spin|author=George Raine|date=March 1, 2006|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2006/03/01/BUG8VHGCI11.DTL}}</ref>  That company formed Spin Media LLC as a [[holding company]]. The new owners replaced editor-in-chief (since 2002) [[Sia Michel]] with Andy Pemberton, a former editor at ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''. The first issue to be published under his brief command was the July 2006 issue—sent to the printer in May 2006—which featured [[Beyoncé]] on the cover. Pemberton and ''Spin'' parted ways the next month, in June 2006. The following editor, Doug Brod, was executive editor during Michel's tenure.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

For ''Spin''{{'}}s 20th anniversary, it published a book chronicling the prior two decades in music. The book has essays on [[grunge]], [[Britpop]], and [[Emo (music)|emo]], among other genres of music, as well as pieces on musical acts including [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Tupac Shakur]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Weezer]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Limp Bizkit]], and [[the Smashing Pumpkins]]. In February 2012, ''Spin'' relaunched the magazine in a larger, bi-monthly format and expanded its online presence, which covered reviews, extended editorials, interviews, and features on up-and-coming talent.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 2011, Caryn Ganz became editor. In July 2012, ''Spin'' was sold to Buzzmedia, which eventually renamed itself [[SpinMedia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/spin-magazine-being-sold-to-buzzmedia-with-plans-to-expand-online-reach/|title= Spin Magazine Is Sold to Buzzmedia, With Plans to Expand Online Reach By Ben Sisario July 10, 2012 7:43 am}}</ref> The September/October 2012 issue of ''Spin'' was the magazine's last print edition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyswarm.com/headlines/spin-dead-long-live-car-and-driver/|title=The Daily Swarm|access-date=May 7, 2016}}</ref>

In 2013, Jem Aswad was named editor. Craig Marks became editor in 2014.

In December 2016, [[Eldridge Industries]] acquired SpinMedia via the Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group for an undisclosed amount.<ref name="adweek-spinbuy">{{cite web|title=Billboard Buys Spin and Vibe in a Quest to ‘Own the Topic of Music Online’|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/billboard-buys-spin-and-vibe-quest-own-topic-music-online-175229/|website=Adweek|access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref>

In 2016, Puja Patel became editor. In 2018, [[Matt Medved]] became editor. In 2020, the publication was sold to the private equity group NEXT Management Partners.

== ''Spin Alternative Record Guide'' ==
{{Main|Spin Alternative Record Guide}}
In 1995, ''Spin'' produced its first book, entitled ''Spin Alternative Record Guide''.{{sfn|Johnston|2007}} It compiled writings by 64 music critics on recording artists and bands relevant to the [[alternative music]] movement, with each artist's entry featuring their discography and albums reviewed and rated a score between one and ten.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon.|2012|p=313}}; {{harvnb|Mazmanian|1995|p=70}}</ref> According to [[Pitchfork Media]]'s Matthew Perpetua, the book featured "the best and brightest writers of the 80s and 90s, many of whom started off in [[webzines|zines]] but have since become major figures in music criticism," including [[Rob Sheffield]], [[Byron Coley]], [[Ann Powers]], [[Simon Reynolds]], and [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]]. Although the book was not a sales success, "it inspired a disproportionate number of young readers to pursue music criticism."{{sfn|Perpetua|2011}} After the book was published, its entry on 1960s folk artist [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], written by [[Byron Coley]], helped renew interest in Fahey's music, leading to interest from record labels and the alternative music scene.{{sfn|Ratliff|1997}}
