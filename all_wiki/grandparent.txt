'''Grandparents''' are the [[parent]]s of a person's [[father]] or [[mother]] – [[paternal]] or [[maternal]].  Every sexually-reproducing living organism who is not a [[genetic chimera]] has a maximum of four [[genetics|genetic]] grandparents, eight genetic great-grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents, thirty-two genetic great-great-great-grandparents, etc.  In the history of modern humanity, around 30,000 years ago, the number of modern humans who lived to be a grandparent increased.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}  It is not known for certain what spurred this increase in longevity but largely results in the improved medical technology and living standard,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-zhavoronkov/13-reasons-why-we-will-li_b_3519357.html|title=13 Reasons Why We Will Live Longer Than Our Parents|last=Zhavoronkov|first=Alex|date=2013-07-02|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-23}}</ref> but it is generally believed that a key consequence of three [[generation]]s being alive together was the preservation of information which could otherwise have been lost; an example of this important information might have been where to find water in times of drought.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wong |first=Kate |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-mysterious-downfall&page=4 |title=The Mysterious Downfall of the Neandertals |publisher=Scientific American |access-date=2013-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Caspari | first1 = R. | doi = 10.1038/scientificamericanhuman1112-38 | title = The Evolution of Grandparents | journal = Scientific American | volume = 22 | pages = 38–43 | year = 2012 | issue = 2 | pmid =  21827124}}</ref>

In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate care for their children (e.g., death of the parents, financial obstacles, marriage problems<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-experience/201510/8-reasons-parents-fail-love-their-kids|title=8 Reasons Parents Fail to Love Their Kids|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-23}}</ref>), grandparents often take on the role of primary caregivers. Even when this is not the case, and particularly in traditional cultures, grandparents often have a direct and clear role in relation to the raising, care and [[nurture]] of [[child]]ren. Grandparents are second-degree relatives and share 25% genetic overlap.

A step-grandparent can be the step-parent of the parent or the step-parent's parent or the step-parent's step-parent (though technically this might be called a step-step-grandparent). The various words for grandparents at times may also be used to refer to any elderly person, especially the terms ''gramps'', ''granny'', ''grandfather'', ''grandmother'', ''nan'', ''maw-maw'', ''paw-paw'' and others which families make up themselves.

When used as a noun (e.g., "... a grandparent walked by"), grandfather and grandmother are usually used, although forms such as grandma/grandpa, granny/granddaddy or even nan/pop are sometimes used. When preceded by "my ..." (e.g., "... my grandpa walked by"), all forms are common (anywhere from "... my grandfather ..." to "... my Gramps ..."). All forms can be used in plural, but Gramps ([[plural]] Gramps<!--not Grampses-->) is rare.

In writing, ''Grandfather'' and ''Grandmother'' are most common, but very rare as a form of address. In speech, ''Grandpa'' and ''Grandma'' are commonly used in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and, particularly prevalent in the Canadian province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], ''Nan'', ''Nana'', ''Nanna'', ''Nanny'', ''Gran'' and ''Granny'' and other variations are often used for grandmother in both writing and speech.

In [[Bangladesh]] and many parts of [[India]], maternal grandparents are called ''Nana'' and ''Nani''. Similarly, paternal grandparents are called ''Dada'' and ''Dadi''. 
One's parents' maternal grandparents are called ''Par-nani'' and ''Par-nana''. On similar lines, parents' paternal grandparents are called ''Par-dadi'' and ''Par-dada.''

[[File:A grandmother takes nutrition classes (6765977597).jpg|thumb|A grandmother taking a nutrition class with her grandson.]]
Numerous other variants exist, such as ''Gramp'', ''Gramps'', ''Grampa'', ''Grandpap'', ''Granda'', ''Grampy'', ''Granddad'', ''Grandad'', ''Granddaddy'', ''Grandpappy'', ''Pop(s)'',  ''Pap,'' ''Pappy'', and ''Pawpaw'' for grandfather; ''Grandmom'', ''Grandmama'', ''Grama'', ''Granny'', ''Gran'', ''Nanny'', ''Nan(a)'', ''Mammaw, Meemaw'' and ''Grammy'' for grandmother. ''Gogo'' can be used for either, etc.<!--do not add names — this is sufficient-->

Given that people may have two living sets of grandparents, some confusion arises from calling two people "grandma" or "grandpa", so often two of the other terms listed above are used for one set of grandparents. Another common solution is to call grandparents by their first names ("Grandpa George", "Grandma Anne", etc.) or by their family names ("Grandpa Jones", "Grandma Smith"). In North America, many families call one set of grandparents by their ethnic names (e.g., [[Hispanic]] grandparents might be called ''abuelo'' and ''abuela'' or "abuelito" and "abuelita", [[French people|French]] grandparents might be called ''papi'' and ''mamie'', [[Italian people|Italian]] grandparents might be called ''nonno'' and ''nonna'', or [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[German people|German]] grandparents might be called ''Opa'' and ''Oma''. In [[Flanders]] pepee or petje and memee or metje are most used). In [[Friesland]], a common pair is pake and beppe. [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking [[Chinese people|Chinese]] Americans refer to maternal grandparents as ''wài pó'' (外婆) and ''wài gōng'' (外公) and paternal grandparents as ''nǎi nai'' (奶奶) and ''yé yé'' (爷爷). In the [[Philippines]], grandparents are called ''lolo'' (grandfather) and ''lola'' (grandmother), respectively.

Languages and cultures with more specific [[kinship terminology]] than English may distinguish between paternal grandparents and maternal grandparents. For example, in the [[Swedish language]] there is no single word for "grandmother"; the mother's mother is termed ''mormor'' and the father's mother is termed ''farmor''.<ref>{{citation |title=Child language, an international perspective: selected papers from the First International Congress for the Study of Child Language |volume=1 |editor-first=Philip S. |editor-last=Dale |editor-link=Philip S. Dale |editor2-first=David |editor2-last=Ingram |publisher=[[University Park Press]] |year=1981 |location=[[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/childlanguageint0000inte/page/275 275] |oclc=6863252 |isbn=978-0-8391-1608-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/childlanguageint0000inte/page/275 }}</ref>
However, the other [[Scandinavian languages]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], use words which specifies the kinship like in Swedish (identically spelled among all three languages), as well as using common terms similar to grandmother (Danish: bedstemor, Norwegian: bestemor).

==Great-grandparents and beyond<!--'Great-grandparent' and 'Great-grandparent' redirect here-->==
[[File:Babur Seeks His Grandmothers Advice.jpg|thumb|[[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] conqueror [[Babur]] seeks the advice of his grandmother.]]

The parents of a grandparent, or the grandparents of a parent, are called the same names as grandparents (grandfather/-mother, grandpa/-ma, granddad/-ma, etc.) with the prefix ''great-'' added, with an additional ''great-'' added for each additional generation. One's great-grandparent's parents would be "great-great-grandparents".

To avoid a proliferation of "greats" when discussing genealogical trees, one may also use [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinals]] instead of multiple "greats"; thus a "great-great-grandfather" would be the "second great-grandfather", and a "great-great-great-grandfather" would be a third great-grandfather, and so on. This system is used by some genealogical websites such as Geni.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com |title=Family Tree & Family History at |publisher=Geni.com |access-date=2013-03-24}}</ref> One may also use [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]] for numbering greats, for example, great-great-great-grandmother becomes 3×-great-grandmother.

Individuals who share the same great-grandparents but are not siblings or [[Cousin#First cousins|first cousins]] are called "second cousins" to each other, as second cousins have grandparents who are siblings. Similarly, "third cousins" would have great-grandparents who are siblings.

==History of the term==
[[File:Nowruz 2017 in Bisaran, Kurdistan province.jpg|thumb|[[Kurds|Kurdish]] family in [[Bisaran]], [[Iran]]]]

The use of the prefix "grand-" dates from the early 13th century, from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] ''graund''. The term was used as a translation of [[Latin]] ''magnus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=ealdef%E6der&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=2013-03-24}}</ref> The prefix "great-" represents a direct translation of Anglo-French ''graund'' and Latin ''magnus'' to English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=great |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=1957-10-01 |access-date=2013-03-24}}</ref> In [[Old English]], the prefixes ''ealde-'' (old) and ''ieldra-'' (elder) were used (''ealdefæder''/''-mōdor'' and ''ieldrafæder''/''-mōdor''). A great-grandfather was called a ''þridda fæder'' (third father), a great-great-grandfather a ''fēowerða fæder'' (fourth father), etc.

There are a few reasons why grandparent involvement is becoming more prevalent. First, life expectancy has increased while fertility rates have decreased. This means that more children are growing up while their grandparents are still alive, whom can become involved in childcare.<ref name=":0" /> In addition, the reduced fertility rates mean that grandparents can devote more attention and resources to their only grandchildren.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Grandparenting: Changing Family Relationships in Global Contexts|last1=Arber|first1=Sara|last2=Timonen|first2=Virpi|publisher=The Policy Press|year=2012|editor-last=Arber|editor-first=Sara|location=Great Britain|pages=247–264|chapter=Grandparenting in the 21st century: New directions|editor-last2=Timonen|editor-first2=Virpi}}</ref> Second, more mothers are involved in the workforce, and thus, other caregivers need to be present to care for the child.<ref name=":0" /> For instance, in Hong Kong, 55% of grandparents reported that they took care of their grandchild because his or her parents have to work.<ref name=":2" /> In South Korea, 53% of working mother reported that they once received child care services from their parents.<ref name="Kim 1–13"/> Third, the increasing number of single-parent families creates a need for grandparental support.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lam|first1=TianYuan|last2=Lam|first2=Chun Bun|last3=Chan|first3=Kevin Ka-Shing|date=2017|title=Grandparental involvement and young adults' cognitive and social adjustment: The moderating role of filial piety in Hong Kong|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=35|issue=7|pages=999–1018|doi=10.1177/0265407517702011|s2cid=151387765}}</ref>

The degree of grandparent involvement also varies depending on the societal context, such as the social welfare policies. For example, in European countries such as Sweden and Denmark, where formal childcare is widely available, grandparents provide less intensive childcare.<ref name=":1" /> By contrast, in European countries such as Spain and Italy, where formal childcare is limited, and welfare payment is low, grandparents provide more intensive childcare.<ref name=":1" /> In Singapore, the grandparent caregiver tax relief was established in 2004, which enables working parents (Singapore citizens with children age 12 and below) whose children are being cared for by unemployed grandparents to receive income tax relief of 3,000 Singaporean dollars.<ref name="Thang 548–570"/>

== Different types of grandparental involvement ==
There are different types of grandparental involvement, including nonresident grandparents, co-resident grandparents, grandparent-maintained household, and custodial grandparents.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Dunifon|first=Rachel|date=2012|title=The influence of grandparents on the lives of children and adolescents|journal=Child Development Perspectives|volume=7|pages=55–60|doi=10.1111/cdep.12016}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Margaret|first=Platt Jendrek|date=1994|title=Grandparents who parent their grandchildren: circumstances and decisions|journal=The Gerontologist|volume=34|issue=2|pages=206–216|doi=10.1093/geront/34.2.206|pmid=8005493}}</ref> 
* Nonresident grandparents: Grandparents who do not live with their grandchildren, but provide care for them,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> such as picking them up from school.
* Co-resident grandparents: Grandparents who live with their grandchild, as well as his/her parents. This type of household is also known as three-generational households.<ref name=":3" /> According to a report that uses data from the 2010 Census, the American Community Survey (ACS), the Current Population Survey (CPS), and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), co-resident grandparents are more likely to be in poverty and suffer from an illness or disability.<ref name=":0" />
* Grandparent-maintained households: A grandparent who is in charge of the household. In this type of household, the parents may or may not be present.<ref name=":0" /> In the US, 33% of children who live in a grandparent-maintained household have only the grandparents present; this is comparable to another 30% who live with a grandmother and one or more parents.<ref name=":0" />
* Custodial grandparents: Grandparents who raise their grandchildren without the presence of the grandchildren's parents in the household. This type of involvement is especially common among ethnic minority groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kataoka-Yahiro|first1=Merle|last2=Ceria|first2=Clementina|last3=Caulfield|first3=Rick|date=2004|title=Grandparent caregiving role in ethnically diverse families|journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing|volume=19|issue=5|pages=315–328|doi=10.1016/j.pedn.2004.05.010|pmid=15614256}}</ref> For instance, approximately 50% of custodial grandparents in the USA belong to an ethnic minority group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/college-of-arts-and-sciences/NCFMR/documents/FP/FP-14-12-grandparents-us.pdf|title=Grandparenthood in the U.S.: Residence Status of Grandparents|last1=Stykes|first1=Bart|last2=Manning|first2=Wendy D.|access-date=November 20, 2017|last3=Brown|first3=Susan L.}}</ref>  In general, grandparents adopt the primary caregiving role for various reasons, such as when the grandchild is neglected or abused by his/her parents, when his/her parents suffer from drug and/or alcohol addiction, when his/her parents have relocated due to job demands, died, incarcerated, or deployed. In some cases, parents remain in contact with their children.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" />

== Impact of grandparental involvement ==
=== On child development ===
Grandparents have different functions in child development. Not only do they provide instrumental support such as picking grandchildren from school or feeding them, but they also offer emotional support.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=Routledge handbook of families in Asia|last1=Xu|first1=Ling|last2=Chi|first2=Iris|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|editor-last=Quah|editor-first=Stella R.|location=New York|pages=246–258|chapter=Ageing and grandparenting in Asia}}</ref> Furthermore, grandparents protect children from being impacted by negative circumstances, such as harsh parenting, poor economic status, and single-parent families.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Melissa A.|last2=Scaramella|first2=Laura V.|last3=Neppl|first3=Tricia K.|last4=Ontai|first4=Lenna L.|last5=Conger|first5=Rand D.|date=2010|title=Grandmother involvement as a protective factor for early childhood social adjustment|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|volume=24|issue=5|pages=635–645|doi=10.1037/a0020829|pmc=2976599|pmid=20954774}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Ruiz|first1=Sarah A.|last2=Silverstein|first2=Merril|date=2007|title=Relationships with grandparents and the emotional well-being of late adolescent and young adult grandchildren|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=63|issue=4|pages=793–808|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00537.x}}</ref> In addition to providing support, grandparents can also help grandchildren with their schoolwork or teach them values that are integral to their society.<ref name=":5" />

Grandparents can have a positive or negative impact on child development. On the one hand, previous research suggests that children and adolescents who have a close relationship with their grandparents tend to have better well-being, experience fewer emotional problems, and demonstrate fewer problematic behaviours.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" /> They are also more academically engaged and are more likely to help others.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yorgason|first1=Jeremy B|last2=Padilla-Walker|first2=Laura|last3=Jackson|first3=Jami|date=2011|title=Nonresidential grandparents' emotional and financial involvement in relation to early adolescent grandchild outcomes|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|volume=21|issue=3|pages=552–558|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00735.x}}</ref> On the other hand, there are also research studies indicating that grandparent involvement is associated with more hyperactivity and peer difficulties among young children.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last1=Fergusson|first1=Emma|last2=Maughan|first2=Barbara|last3=Golding|first3=Jean|date=2007|title=Which children receive grandparental care and what effect does it have?|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume=49|issue=2|pages=161–169|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01840.x|pmid=17979960}}</ref> In other words, children who are cared for by their grandparents can have more interpersonal relationship problems.<ref name=":12" /> Also, children who are under the care of their grandparents have poorer health outcomes such as obesity, and more injuries due to low safety awareness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pulgaron|first1=Elizabeth R.|last2=Marchante|first2=Ashley N.|last3=Agosto|first3=Yaray|last4=Lebron|first4=Cynthia N.|last5=Delamater|first5=Alan M.|date=2016|title=Grandparent involvement and children's health outcomes: the current state of the literature|journal=Families, Systems and Health|volume=34|issue=3|pages=260–269|doi=10.1037/fsh0000212|pmid=27505069|pmc=5025375}}</ref>

However, there are also positive effects of being involved in grandchildren raising.

Taking care of grandchildren can also have benefits on grandparents’ emotional health.

== Cultural comparisons of grandparent involvement in childcare ==
[[File:Grandmother and granddaughter＿taiwan.jpg|thumb|Grandmother and her granddaughter]]
Grandparental involvement differs between Western and Eastern cultures. Grandparents taking care of their grandchildren is a common phenomenon in China due to Chinese traditions which emphasize family harmony, collective well-being, intergenerational exchanges and filial responsibilities.<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=Jing|last2=Mao|first2=Weiyu|last3=Lee|first3=Yura|last4=Chi|first4=Iris|date=2016-01-04|title=The Impact of Caring for Grandchildren on Grandparents' Physical Health Outcomes: The Role of Intergenerational Support|journal=Research on Aging|language=en|volume=39|issue=5|pages=612–634|doi=10.1177/0164027515623332|pmid=26733495|s2cid=3501128}}</ref> China's unique philosophies, Buddhism and Taoism, play important roles in forming these cultural values. While Chinese Buddhism emphasizes prioritized role of the family in Chinese society and harmonious relations among family members,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Kin Cheung (George)|last2=Oh|first2=Alice|last3=Zhao|first3=Qianru|last4=Wu|first4=Fang-Yi|last5=Chen|first5=Shiyun|last6=Diaz|first6=Thomas|last7=Ong|first7=Chez Kuang|date=2017-07-03|title=Repentance in Chinese Buddhism: Implications for Mental Health Professionals|journal=Journal of Spirituality in Mental Health|volume=19|issue=3|pages=210–226|doi=10.1080/19349637.2016.1204258|s2cid=147858749|issn=1934-9637}}</ref> Taoism emphasizes the importance of harmony in interpersonal relations and relations between nature and the humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Ellen Marie|last2=Center|first2=Philosophy Documentation|date=1969-08-01|title=Nothingness and the Mother Principle in Early Chinese Taoism|journal=International Philosophical Quarterly|volume=9|issue=3|pages=391–405|doi=10.5840/ipq19699332}}</ref> These philosophies underline the important role that families play in Chinese cultures. Besides cultural factors, grandparents taking care of their grandchildren also appears in the context in which their adult children need to work full-time, and the child care services are either too expensive (in big cities) or too scarce (in remote areas).<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|last1=Cong|first1=Zhen|last2=Silverstein|first2=Merril|date=April 2012|title=Caring for grandchildren and intergenerational support in rural China: a gendered extended family perspective|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ageing-and-society/article/caring-for-grandchildren-and-intergenerational-support-in-rural-china-a-gendered-extended-family-perspective/54884FB9B14DE4065FB82E9855DCC199|journal=Ageing & Society|volume=32|issue=3|pages=425–450|doi=10.1017/s0144686x11000420|issn=1469-1779}}</ref> Grandparents serving as their grandchildren's caregiver is particularly common in rural China. Due to the fast development of [[urbanization in China]] since the 1980s, up to 220 million migrant workers from rural areas move to urban areas to seek for more job opportunities, which leave around 58 million children behind in rural areas,<ref name=":10" /> grandparents, therefore, undertake the role of parents and become caregivers to their grandchildren. A new population named “left-behind grandparents”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.cctv.com/2017/06/19/ARTIwcjdVnf3stqB4rpGm8qn170619.shtml|title=【吾老吾幼·大山深处的留守】留守祖母：大山深处的奉献与思念_新闻频道_央视网(cctv.com)|last=滕雪|website=news.cctv.com|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref> appears in this context, these grandparents live in rural China, and their main job is to look after their grandchildren, most of these grandparents are facing financial burdens and wish their adult children could come back. The mental and physical health of “left-behind grandparents” needs more attention from the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150325/43409767_0.shtml|title=留守奶奶去世多日无人知 1岁半孙女险饿死|website=news.ifeng.com|access-date=2017-11-23}}</ref> Even though in urban areas where child care services are available, nearly all grandparents still prefer to take care of their grandchildren voluntarily. Not only because this can reduce their adult children's financial burdens on child care services but also taking care of their own grandchildren is a more effective way to maintain family harmony.<ref name=":9" />

In the US, taking care of grandchildren is not a necessary responsibility of grandparents. Grandparents taking care of their grandchildren is often caused by involuntary events or crisis, and it is more like a solution to a problem, not an initiative desire, which is a distinct difference from that in China.<ref name=":11">{{Cite journal|last1=Hayslip|first1=Bert|last2=Kaminski|first2=Patricia L.|date=2005-04-01|title=Grandparents Raising Their Grandchildren: A Review of the Literature and Suggestions for Practice|journal=The Gerontologist|language=en|volume=45|issue=2|pages=262–269|doi=10.1093/geront/45.2.262|pmid=15799992|issn=0016-9013|doi-access=free}}</ref> For example, grandparents in the USA often take care of their grandchildren when their adult children get into troubles such as substance abuse, incarceration or parental death.<ref name=":11" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Minkler|first1=Meredith|last2=Driver|first2=Diane|last3=Roe|first3=Kathleen M.|last4=Bedeian|first4=Katherine|date=1993-12-01|title=Community Interventions To Support Grandparent Caregivers|journal=The Gerontologist|volume=33|issue=6|pages=807–811|doi=10.1093/geront/33.6.807|pmid=8314108|issn=0016-9013}}</ref> Differences also exist in different ethnicities in the US, Caucasian individuals generally regard individual independence as more important, so grandparents are less likely to take care of their grandchildren.
