{{short description|Political process that led to full Canadian sovereignty from the UK}}
{{Constitutional history of Canada}}
'''Patriation''' is the political process that led to full [[Canadian sovereignty]], culminating with the [[Constitution Act, 1982]]. The process was necessary because under the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], with Canada's agreement at the time, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] had retained the power to amend Canada's [[British North America Acts|Constitution Acts]] (Statute of Westminster sec. 7(1)), and to enact more generally for Canada at the request and with the consent of the Dominion (sec. 4). That authority was removed from the UK by the passing of the [[Canada Act 1982]] on March 29, 1982, by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], as requested by the [[Parliament of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/politics-government/proclamation-constitution-act-1982/Pages/proclamation-constitution-act-1982.aspx  |title=Proclamation of the Constitution Act, 1982 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=May 5, 2014 |website=Canada.ca |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=February 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  |date=March 17, 2009 |title=A statute worth 75 cheers |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/a-statute-worth-75-cheers/article1329730/ |newspaper=Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |access-date=February 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/2017/canada-is-celebrating-150-years-of-what-exactly-1.3883315 |title=Canada is celebrating 150 years of… what, exactly? |last=Couture |first=Christa |date=January 1, 2017 |website=CBC |publisher=CBC |access-date=February 10, 2017 |quote=... the Constitution Act itself cleaned up a bit of unfinished business from the Statute of Westminster in 1931, in which Britain granted each of the Dominions full legal autonomy if they chose to accept it.

Patriation was subsequently confirmed by the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], part of the Canada Act 1982. A proclamation bringing the Constitution Act, 1982 into effect was signed by [[Elizabeth II]], as [[Queen of Canada]], then-Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] and then-Minister of Justice [[Jean Chrétien]]  on April 17, 1982, on [[Parliament Hill]], in [[Ottawa]].<ref name="Lauterpacht">{{Cite book |title=International law reports.

The patriation process saw the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] granted influence in constitutional matters and resulted in the constitution being amendable by Canada only and according to [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|its amending formula]], with no role for the United Kingdom. Hence, patriation is associated with the establishment of full sovereignty.

==Etymology==
The word ''patriation'' was coined in Canada as a [[back-formation]] from ''[[repatriation]]'' (returning to one's country). Prior to 1982, power to amend the Canadian constitution was held by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (subject in some respects to request and consent from Canada); hence some have felt that the term patriation was more suitable than the term repatriation (returning something).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/the-imperative-of-a-referendum.pdf |title=The Imperative of a Referendum |last=Dutil |first=Patrice |date=13 February 2017 |publisher=Fraser Institute |quote=1980, the newly elected government (elected with 44% of the vote) headed by Pierre Elliott Trudeau launched a drive to patriate the Canadian Constitution}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Constitutional law of Canada |last=Hogg |first=Peter |date=2003 |publisher=Carswell |isbn=9780459240851 |edition=student |location=Scarborough, Ont. |pages=55 |oclc=51801564 }}</ref> The term was first used in 1966 by Prime Minister [[Lester B. Pearson]] in response to a question in parliament: "We intend to do everything we can to have the constitution of Canada repatriated, or patriated."<ref>House of Commons Debates (Hansard), 373/2 (28 Jan. 1966).  Documented as earliest known use in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], entry ''patriate.''</ref>

==Early attempts==
From 1867, the [[Constitution of Canada]] was primarily contained in the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]], and other [[British North America Acts]], which were passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Several [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian prime minister]]s, starting with [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] in 1927, had made attempts to domesticize the amending formula, but could not obtain agreement with the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial governments]] as to how such a formula would work.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/aia/index.asp?lang=eng&page=hist&doc=westminster-eng.htm| last=Privy Council Office| title=Intergovernmental Affairs > History > Why, in 1931, Canada Chose Not to Exercise its Full Autonomy as Provided for Under the Statute of Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| access-date=21 June 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805231601/http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/aia/index.asp?lang=eng&page=hist&doc=westminster-eng.htm| archive-date=5 August 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref> Thus, even after the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] granted Canada and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]] full legislative independence in 1931, Canada requested that the British North America Act, 1867, be excluded from the laws that were now within Canada's complete control to amend; until 1949, the constitution could only be changed by a further act at [[Westminster]]. The [[British North America Acts|British North America (No.2) Act, 1949]], granted the Parliament of Canada limited power to amend the constitution in many areas of its own jurisdiction, without involvement of the United Kingdom. The constitution was amended in this manner five times: in 1952, 1965, 1974, and twice in 1975.

Negotiations continued sporadically between federal and provincial governments on the development of a new amending formula in which the United Kingdom would have no part. In the 1960s, efforts by the governments of Prime Ministers [[John Diefenbaker]] and [[Lester Pearson]], including the Confederation of Tomorrow conference in Canada's [[Canadian Centennial|centennial year]],{{#tag:ref|The conference was held between 27 and 30 November 1967 on the 54th floor of the newly finished [[Toronto-Dominion Centre|Toronto-Dominion Bank Tower]]. The summit was convened by [[Premier of Ontario|Ontario Premier]] [[John Robarts]] and attended by all the other provincial premiers except [[W.A.C. Bennett]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19671201&id=ssQtAAAAIBAJ&pg=7192,47307&hl=en| title=Confederation of Toronto Conference| date=1 December 1967| newspaper=Montreal Gazette| access-date=30 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2015/ed/bgrd/backgroundfile-85888.pdf| title=Lessons from Canada's Centennial and Other Celebrations for Planning for Toronto's Participation in Canada 150!

In 1968, Pearson was succeeded by [[Pierre Trudeau]], who also advocated patriation. He made several attempts, including the [[Victoria Charter]] in 1971 and more proposed amendments in 1978. At the 1978-79 conference, Trudeau prepared for the first time to provide some federal concessions with regard to the division of powers, including family law, fisheries, and resources.<ref>{{cite book| last=Fraser| first=Graham| title=PQ: René Lévesque and the Parti Québécois in Power| page=173| year=1984| location=Toronto| publisher=MacMillan| isbn=0771597932}}</ref> However, the other premiers balked, which led to speculation they were waiting to see if the more province-friendly [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] would win the coming [[1979 Canadian federal election|federal election]].<ref>{{harvnb| Fraser| 1984| p=174}}</ref> In that campaign, the Liberals ran on constitutional change, including a speech at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in which Trudeau promised unilateral action if the premiers did not agree to patriation.<ref>{{harvnb| Fraser| 1984| p=179}}</ref>

==Patriation achieved==
Patriation was given a new impetus after the [[1980 Quebec referendum|1980 referendum on Quebec independence]], before which Trudeau promised a new constitutional agreement if the majority of Quebecers voted "No". After a number of days of negotiation and the leak of the Kirby Memo which antagonized Quebec, by an "internal federal source",<ref>{{cite book |last=MacGuigan |first=Mark |date=30 September 2002 |title=An Inside Look at External Affairs During the Trudeau Years: The Memoirs of Mark MacGuigan |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1552380769 |location=Calgary |publisher=University of Calgary Press |page=90 |isbn=978-1-55238-076-5 |author-link=Mark MacGuigan}}</ref> after provincial premiers consulted at the [[Chateau Laurier]], drafted a list of 10 powers to be devolved to the provinces in exchange for consent to patriation. Trudeau, when presented with the document, refused to accept it and reiterated his threat that he would seek the House of Commons' approval to proceed with a unilateral amendment. Faced with Premier of Manitoba [[Sterling Lyon]]'s charge that it would "tear the country apart", Trudeau responded that, if Canada could not have control of its own constitution and a charter when most provinces had their own, the country would deserve to be torn apart.<ref>{{cite book| last=Trudeau| first=Pierre Elliot| title=Memoirs| page=[https://archive.org/details/memoirs00trud/page/306 306]| location=Toronto| year=1993| publisher=McClelland & Stewart| isbn=0-771-08588-5| oclc=30702551| author-link=Pierre Trudeau| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/memoirs00trud}}</ref>

===Canada Bill and provincial opposition===
Trudeau announced his belief that the premiers were dealing in bad faith and met with his caucus to propose a new course. After offering a wide range of options and proposing full reform, a Quebec MP shouted "''Allons-y en Cadillac!''"<ref name=Trudeau309>{{harvnb| Trudeau| 1993| p=309}}</ref> (translated by Trudeau to mean "let's go first class ... be liberal to the end ... not to temper our convictions with political expediency").<ref>{{Cite book |title=Just watch me : the life of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 1968-2000 |last=English |first=John |date=2009 |publisher=Alfred A.

The proposal would request patriation from the UK parliament, as well as the entrenchment of a charter of rights, and would call for a referendum to be held within two years on the amending formula for the new constitution, which would be a choice between the [[Victoria Charter]] veto formula and any joint proposal by the provinces that could be approved by provinces totalling 80% of the population.{{#tag:ref|The Victoria Charter formula was chosen due to it being unanimously accepted at that conference in 1972, which eventually failed on other grounds; An amendment would require the approval of Ontario, Quebec, two [[Western Canada|Western provinces]] and two [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic Provinces]] and the Federal government.  It should also be noted that the second proposal requiring provinces consisting of 80% of the population would, by necessity, require Ontario's and Quebec's approval.|group=n|name=Pop}}

[[File:Bill Davis Toronto 1984.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Premier of Ontario [[Bill Davis]]]]
Trudeau found new allies in Premiers [[Bill Davis]] ([[Ontario]]) and [[Richard Hatfield]] ([[New Brunswick]])<ref name=Trudeau310>{{harvnb| Trudeau| 1993| p=310}}</ref> and the federal New Democratic Party, under Ed Broadbent, announced its support after persuading Trudeau to devolve some resource powers to the provinces.<ref name=Trudeau310/> The Prime Minister's proposal in the House of Commons, which would be tabled as the Canada Bill, invited Aboriginal, feminist, and other groups to Ottawa for their input on the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|charter of rights]] in legislative committees. However, there was disagreement over the charter, which the premiers of six provinces (Lyon, [[René Lévesque]] of [[Quebec]], [[Bill Bennett]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Angus MacLean]] of [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Peter Lougheed]] of [[Alberta]], and [[Brian Peckford]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]) opposed as encroachments on their power; the press dubbed this the ''Gang of Six''. Manitoba, Newfoundland, and Quebec launched [[reference question|references]] to their respective courts of appeal asking if the Canada Bill was constitutional.  Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan remained neutral.

At the insistence of British Columbia, the premiers who opposed unilateral patriation drafted an alternative proposal to showcase the disagreement between the sides and to counter the federal government's charges of obstructionism if the document were to proceed to Westminster. The idea was for patriation to take place with no charter of rights and the amending formula would permit amendment with the approval of seven provinces consisting of 50% of the population, referred to as the ''Vancouver Formula''. The premiers' innovation was a clause allowing for dissenting provinces to "opt out" of new amendments that superseded provincial jurisdiction and receive equivalent funding to run a substitute programme if 2/3 of the members of the provincial legislature acquiesced.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Canada's Constitution Act 1982 & amendments : a documentary history |last=Bayefsky |first=Anne F |date=1989 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson |isbn=978-0-07549-500-0 |volume=II |location=Toronto |pages=804, 808 |oclc=22731830}}</ref> Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan approved of this, prompting the press to now call the opposition premiers the ''Gang of Eight''.

Trudeau rejected the proposed document out of hand and again threatened to take the case for patriation straight to the British parliament "[without] bothering to ask one premier." The federal Cabinet and Crown counsel took the position that if the British Crown—in council, parliament, and on the bench—was to exercise its residual sovereignty over Canada, it did so at the request of the federal ministers of the Crown only.<ref name=Romney273-4>{{Cite book| last=Romney| first=Paul| title=Getting it wrong: how Canadians forgot their past and imperilled Confederation| publisher=University of Toronto Press| year=1999| location=Toronto| pages=[https://archive.org/details/gettingitwrongho0000romn/page/273 273]–274| url=https://archive.org/details/gettingitwrongho0000romn| url-access=registration| isbn=978-0-8020-8105-6<!--CITEREF_Romney_1999-->}}</ref> The gang soon appealed to the courts.

===Patriation Reference===

[[File:Ottawa - ON - Oberster Gerichtshof von Kanada.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Supreme Court of Canada]]]]

The reference cases brought to the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] and [[Manitoba Court of Appeal]] were both decided in favour of the Federal government.  However, in a split decision, the [[Newfoundland Court of Appeal]] decided that provincial approval was necessary.  The governments of Manitoba and Quebec appealed from their court decisions to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], and the federal government appealed from the decision of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal.

On September 28, 1981, the Court ruled (for the first time, on live television) that the federal government had the right, by letter of the law, to proceed with the unilateral patriation of the constitution (the decision seven to two in favour). However, by a different six-to-three majority, the court said that the constitution was made up as much of convention as written law and ruled that a unilateral patriation was not in accordance with constitutional convention. Although the courts enforce laws, not constitutional conventions, the Court's decision stated that agreement by a "substantial" number of premiers would be required to abide by the convention.<ref name=Romney275/> This number was not defined and commentators later criticized the court's failure to rule that the approval of all provinces was required.<ref name=Romney275/><ref>{{Cite book| last=Russell| first=Peter H.| author-link=Peter H.

Lévesque would later remark: "In other words, Trudeau's goals might be unconstitutional, illegitimate, and even 'go against the principles of federalism,' but they were legal!" Trudeau, in his memoirs, paraphrased the court as saying "that patriation was legal, but not nice."

Both the United Kingdom and Canada undertook contingency preparations: [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s British cabinet explored simply unilaterally patriating the constitution to Canada with an amending formula requiring unanimous approval of the provinces.<ref>{{cite book| last=Bastien| first=Frédéric| title=The Battle of London: Trudeau, Thatcher, and the Fight for Canada's Constitution| pages=286–8| year=2013| location=Toronto| publisher=Dundurn| isbn=978-1-45972-329-0}}</ref> Trudeau began to plan for a referendum proposing a [[unilateral declaration of independence]] in the event of a United Kingdom refusal.<ref>{{harvnb| Bastien| 2013| pp=283–6}}</ref>

===Conference===
The decision set the stage for a meeting amongst all premiers and Trudeau in [[Ottawa]], on November 2, 1981. The conference opened with Trudeau announcing an openness to a new amending formula, Davis postulating that his cabinet could accept an agreement without an Ontario veto, and Hatfield proposing deferral of some elements of a charter.<ref name=Bastien290>{{harvnb| Bastien| 2013| p=290}}</ref> This was seen as a general opening toward the provincial proposal, though Trudeau declared the charter was non-negotiable.<ref name=Bastien290/>

A compromise put to Trudeau involving amending the Group of Eight's proposal with a limited charter was met with a blunt refusal, with federal officials declining a "gutted charter",<ref name=Bastien291>{{harvnb| Bastien| 2013| p=291}}</ref><ref name=Fraser294>{{harvnb| Fraser| 1984| p=294}}</ref> while Lévesque and Trudeau argued on the language provisions of the charter.<ref name=Bastien291/> On November 3, the premiers' breakfast meeting saw two new proposals floated: The Premier of Saskatchewan, [[Allan Blakeney]], would accept a charter without language rights and constitutional amendment by any seven provinces, regardless of population and the removal of financial compensation,<ref name=Fraser294/> while Bennett would allow Trudeau his language rights provisions in exchange for other considerations.<ref name=Bastien292>{{harvnb| Bastien| 2013| p=292}}</ref> Lyon and Lévesque were angered and refused to go along, with Lougheed successfully suggesting the ideas be proposed to test Trudeau's negotiating position.<ref name=Bastien292/> In return, Trudeau launched a new federal initiative to the premiers: patriate the constitution as it was, but continue debates for two years and, if deadlock resulted, hold a national [[referendum]] on the amending formula and charter.<ref name=Bastien292/> Lévesque, fearing the alliance was crumbling and facing mocking remarks by Trudeau that as a "great democrat" (especially after the recent [[1980 Quebec referendum|referendum]] he initiated on Quebec's independence), but confident he could ensure any referendum on a charter would fail, agreed in principle.<ref name=Fraser295>{{harvnb| Fraser| 1984| p=295}}</ref> Trudeau promptly announced a "Canada-Quebec alliance" on the issue to the press, stating "[[Throw the cat among the pigeons|the cat is among the pigeons]]."<ref name=Fraser295/>

The other seven opposition premiers were startled: Campaigning against the protection of rights was generally seen as political suicide,<ref name=Fraser296>{{harvnb| Fraser| 1984| p=296}}</ref> and a national referendum could be seen as "conventionalizing" the charter without the need for provincial approval.<ref name=Fraser295/> Further, Canadians nationwide were mostly in agreement with Trudeau on the issue and were tired of the constant constitutional talks;  The draft text of the Federal proposal was later revealed to involve the approval of Trudeau's reforms, with referendums being only if provinces representing 80% of the population demanded them within the two years.<ref name=Fraser296/> This prompted Lévesque to back away from the referendum proposal, saying it looked as though it was "written in Chinese."<ref name=Fraser296/> The conference descended again into acrimony, with Trudeau and Lévesque angrily clashing over language rights.<ref name=Bastien294>{{harvnb| Bastien| 2013| p=294}}</ref> Trudeau announced that he would attend one final meeting at 9am the following day and head to Westminster if agreement was not reached.<ref name=Bastien294/> Peckford announced that Newfoundland would forward a proposal the next day.<ref name=Bastien294/> Lévesque and the Quebec delegation went to sleep in [[Hull, Quebec]], for the night.

===Kitchen Accord<span id="The Kitchen Accord"></span>===

That night—November 4, 1981—the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]], [[Jean Chrétien]], met with [[Attorney General of Saskatchewan]] [[Roy Romanow]] and [[Attorney General of Ontario]] [[Roy McMurtry]] in the kitchen of Ottawa's [[Government Conference Centre]]. The attorneys general discussed a scenario in which the provinces would agree to the charter and disallowing opting-out with compensation, while Chrétien agreed to the Vancouver amending formula and reluctantly offered to include the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Notwithstanding Clause]] in the constitution.<ref name=Bastien295>{{harvnb| Bastien| 2013| p=295}}</ref> Chrétien, who had been deeply involved in supporting the "no" side of the Quebec referendum and abhorred the possibility of another one, recommended the compromise to Trudeau,<ref name=Bastien295/> but the Prime Minister felt, given the previous chaos, it would still be impossible to obtain the agreement of his provincial counterparts and demurred.<ref name=Bastien295/> Hatfield and Davis, however, agreed in principle to the compromise and told Trudeau that he should do so as well, informing him they would not be on his side if he proceeded unilaterally at that point.<ref name=Bastien295/> Trudeau, who knew that his position in London was growing tenuous, even with the support he had, accepted.<ref>{{harvnb| Bastien| 2013| p=296}}</ref> Thus, working with the draft proposal created by the Newfoundland delegation,<ref name=Leeson112>{{cite book| last=Leeson| first=Howard| title=The Patriation Minutes| page=112| location=Edmonton| publisher=Centre For Constitutional Studies| year=2011| isbn=978-0986936500}}</ref><ref name=Leeson59>{{harvnb| Leeson| 2011| pp=59–60}}</ref> the nine groups worked through the night to prepare the compromise proposal. This period would be called the ''Kitchen Accord''; the men at the table that night became known as the ''Kitchen Cabinet''.

At the end of this period of negotiations, René Lévesque left to sleep at Hull, a city located on the other side of the Ottawa river, before leaving he asked the other premiers (who were all lodged at the same hotel in Ottawa) to call him if anything happened.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = UBC Press| isbn = 978-0-7748-2864-2| pages = 3–24| editor1 = Lois Harder |editor2 = Steve Patten | last1 = Harder| first1 = Lois| last2 = Patten| first2 = Steve| title = Patriation and Its Consequences: Constitution Making in Canada| chapter = Looking Back on Patriation and Its Consequences| location = Vancouver, BC| date = 2015}}</ref>
Lévesque and his people, all in Quebec, remained ignorant of the agreement until Lévesque walked into the premiers' breakfast and was told the agreement had been reached. Lévesque refused to give his support to the deal and left the meeting; the government of Quebec subsequently announced on November 25, 1981, that it would veto the decision. However, both the Quebec Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, which issued [[Quebec Veto Reference|its ruling on the matter]] on December 6, 1982, stated that Quebec had never held such veto powers.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Russell| first=Peter H.| author-link=Peter H.

The events were divisive. [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]] saw the deal as the English-speaking premiers betraying Quebec, which prompted use of the term '''''Nuit des Longs Couteaux''''', or "Night of the Long Knives".{{#tag:ref|Trudeau, in his essay on the Quebec referendum, regarding the curious and distasteful use of this description, remarked: "The 'Night' in question is of course that of the so-called 'Long Knives', a label shamelessly borrowed from Nazi history by separatists suffering from acute paranoia."<ref>{{cite news| title=Trudeau accuses Bouchard of betraying Quebecers| newspaper=Montreal Gazette| date=Feb 3, 1996| url=https://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/Arguments/trudeau-gazette-1.html}}</ref>|group=n|name=Knives}} In English Canada, Lévesque was seen as having tried to do the same to the English-speaking premiers by accepting the referendum. Among those was [[Brian Mulroney]], who said that by "accepting Mr. Trudeau's referendum idea, Mr. Levesque [sic] himself abandoned, without notice, his colleagues of the common front." Chrétien's role in the negotiations made him reviled among [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntists]]. Until the [[Liberal Party of Quebec|Quebec Liberals]] came to power in 1985, every law passed in Quebec used the Notwithstanding Clause.

Further, Peckford rebuked in an article in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' claims the events that night resembled anything akin to the Kitchen Accord or Night of the Long Knives.<ref name=peckford>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/a-fresh-stab-at-the-night-of-the-long-knives/article2234318/|title=A fresh stab at 'the night of the long knives'|author=Peckford, Brian|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=November 11, 2011|access-date=March 5, 2012}}</ref> According to Peckford, four premiers—from Newfoundland, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia—and senior representatives from Alberta and British Columbia, worked from a proposal brought to the meeting by the Newfoundland delegation. Efforts were made to reach the other provinces, including Quebec, but to no avail. Peckford further asserted that Chrétien was not contacted and he had no knowledge of the "so-called kitchen meetings". The proposal agreed upon that night was essentially the same as the Newfoundland delegation's, except for minor alterations to wording and the addition of a new section, and the final draft was to go to all the provinces for approval the following morning.<ref name=peckford/>

Peckford's assertions have, in turn, been challenged by Howard Leeson, who was then the Saskatchewan Deputy Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs and present during all of the negotiations that night.<ref name=Leeson112/> He claimed that, while the officials did work from Newfoundland's draft, it was only because it was largely similar to the Kitchen Accord, which had already been developed and agreed to by the governments of Ontario and Saskatchewan and was known to the federal government.<ref name=Leeson59/> Further, Peckford played only a minor role that evening, entering later, with the majority of the negotiating being done by Blakeney and Davis. Leeson concluded that Davis and Lougheed were the most important players in securing an agreement.<ref>{{harvnb| Leeson| 2011| pp=85–99}}</ref> In his opinion, the presence in the National Archives of Canada of the Kitchen Accord leaves no doubt about its existence and it was one of several crucial linkages in the patriation negotiations.<ref>{{Harvnb| Leeson| 2011| p=96}}</ref>

===Legal closure===
With the agreement of the majority of provincial governments, the federal government moved to implement the patriation package. Joint resolutions of the Canadian House of Commons and the Senate requested that the Queen cause to be introduced in the British Parliament the necessary legislation to patriate the constitution. The resolution contained the text of what was to become the [[Canada Act 1982]], which included the [[Constitution Act, 1982]].<ref>[http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3635&context=lcp Text of the Resolution respecting the Constitution of Canada adopted by the House of Commons on December 2, 1981.]</ref> The British Parliament then passed the Canada Act 1982, and Queen [[Elizabeth II]], as [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]], granted  Royal Assent on March 29, 1982, 115 years to the day when Queen Victoria gave assent to the British North America Act, 1867.<ref>{{cite book| last=Lederman| first=William| date=1983| contribution=The Supreme Court of Canada and Basic Constitutional Amendment| editor-last=Banting| editor-first=Keith G.| editor2-last=Simeon| editor2-first=Richard| title=And no one cheered: federalism, democracy, and the Constitution Act| page=177| location=Toronto| publisher=Taylor & Francis| isbn=978-0-458-95950-1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sUwOAAAAQAAJ| access-date=June 12, 2010}}</ref> The Canada Act 1982 contained the Constitution Act, 1982, which itself included an amending formula involving only the federal House of Commons and Senate, and provincial legislative assemblies.

Canada had established the final step in complete sovereignty as an independent country, with the Queen's role as monarch of Canada separate from her role as the British monarch or the monarch of any of the other Commonwealth realms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.revparl.ca/27/2/27n2_04e_trepanier.pdf |title=Some Visual Aspects of the Monarchical Tradition |last=Trepanier |first=Peter |date=2004 |website=Canadian Parliamentary Review |publisher=Canadian Parliamentary Review |access-date=10 February 2017}}</ref>

Being aware that this was the first time in Canadian history that a major constitutional change had been made without the Quebec government's agreement and Quebec's exclusion from the patriation agreement had caused a rift, the Queen privately conveyed to journalists her regret that the province was not part of the settlement.{{#tag:ref|The Queen later publicly expressed on 22 and 23 October 1987 her personal support for the [[Meech Lake Accord]], which attempted to bring Quebec governmental backing to the patriated constitution by introducing further amendments, and she received criticism from opponents of the accord, which failed to attract the unanimous support from all federal and provincial legislators required for it to pass.<ref>{{cite magazine| last=Geddes| first=John| title=The day she descended into the fray| magazine=Maclean's| issue=Special Commemorative Edition: The Diamond Jubilee: Celebrating 60 Remarkable years| year=2012| page=72| publisher=Rogers Communications}}</ref>|group=n|name=Meech}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crht.ca/DiscoverMonarchyFiles/QueenElizabethII.html |work=The Canadian Royal Heritage Trust |title=Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada |author1=Arthur Bousfield |author2=Garry Toffoli |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203130727/http://www.crht.ca/DiscoverMonarchyFiles/QueenElizabethII.html |archive-date=February 3, 2007 }}</ref> Quebec sovereigntists have, since 1982, demanded that the Queen or another member of the [[Monarchy of Canada#Royal family and house|Canadian Royal Family]] apologize for the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, calling the event a part of a "cultural genocide of francophones in North America over the last 400 years."<ref>{{Cite news| title=Charles must apologize: Quebec sovereigntists| publisher=CBC| date=30 October 2009| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2009/10/30/st-jean-baptiste-prince-charles.html| access-date=March 7, 2011}}</ref> In 2002, Premier of Quebec [[Bernard Landry]] directed the [[Executive Council of Quebec|executive council]] and lieutenant governor not to recognise [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II#Canada|Elizabeth's golden jubilee]] in protest of the Queen having signed the Constitution Act, 1982.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Phillips| first=Stephen| title=Republicanism in Canada in the reign of Elizabeth II: the dog that didn't bark| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Summer 2004| issue=22| pages=19–20| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2004/Sum04PDFRepublicanism.pdf| access-date=10 February 2009| url-status=dead| archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/5m4qmpsRx?url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2004/Sum04PDFRepublicanism.pdf| archive-date=December 17, 2009 }}</ref>

==Legal questions==
As constitutional scholar Robin White has noted, some might think that, since the Canada Act 1982 is British as well as Canadian law, the United Kingdom could theoretically repeal it and declare its laws to be binding in Canada. Peter Hogg, however, disputes this view, noting that since Canada is now sovereign, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] would find a British law which purported to be binding in Canada just as invalid in Canada "as a law enacted for Canada by [[Portugal]]."<ref>{{Harvnb| Hogg| 2003| p=58}}</ref> Paul Romney argued in 1999 that, regardless of what the British authorities did, the constitutional principle of [[responsible government]] in Canada denied them the right to ever again legislate for Canada; he stated: "[T]he constitutional convention known as responsible government entailed legal as well as political sovereignty. Responsible government meant that the Queen of Canada could constitutionally act for Canada only on the advice of her Canadian ministers. If the British parliament were to legislate for Canada except at the request of the competent Canadian authorities, and the Queen assented to that legislation on the advice of her British ministers, Canadian courts would refuse to enforce that legislation."<ref>{{Harvnb| Romney| 1999| p=272}}</ref>
