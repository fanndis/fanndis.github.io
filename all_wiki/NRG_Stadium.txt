'''NRG Stadium''' (pronounced as N-R-G Stadium), formerly '''Reliant Stadium''', is a multi-purpose [[stadium]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], United States. It was constructed at a cost of $352 million and has a [[seating capacity]] of 72,220.<ref name="reliantpark">{{cite web |title=Reliant Park, Reliant Park Info, Reliant Stadium|url=http://www.reliantpark.com/reliantstadium/|publisher=Reliant Stadium|accessdate=March 30, 2008}}</ref><ref name="ballparks">{{cite web |title=Reliant Stadium|url=http://football.ballparks.com/NFL/HoustonTexans/index.htm|publisher=Ballparks.com|accessdate=March 30, 2008}}</ref> It was the first NFL facility to have a [[retractable roof]].<ref name="nflteamhistory">{{cite web|title=Houston Texans – Reliant Stadium|url=http://www.nflteamhistory.com/nfl_teams/houston_texans/stadium.html|work=NFL Team History|accessdate=March 30, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621092204/http://nflteamhistory.com/nfl_teams/houston_texans/stadium.html|archive-date=June 21, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The stadium is the home of the [[National Football League]]'s [[Houston Texans]], the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]], the [[Texas Bowl]], many of the [[United States men's national soccer team]]'s matches, [[Mexico national football team]] friendlies where ''El Tri'' serves as the host, and other events. The stadium served as the host facility for [[Super Bowl]]s [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|XXXVIII]] (2004) and [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] (2017), and [[WrestleMania XXV]] (2009).<ref>{{cite news |title=City of Houston Will Host Super Bowl LI in 2017|url=https://abc13.com/archive/9110662/|work=[[KTRK-TV|KTRK]]|location=Houston|date=May 21, 2013|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref>

NRG Stadium is part of a collection of venues (including the [[Astrodome]]), which are collectively called [[NRG Park]]. The entire complex is [[naming rights|named]] for [[NRG Energy]] under a 32-year, US$300 million naming rights deal in 2000.

==History==
The Houston NFL Holdings group came to [[Populous (company)|Populous]] (then HOK Sport) to begin the schematic design for the first-ever NFL retractable roof football stadium in 1997. The intention was to create a football stadium to replace the Astrodome that would operate like an open-air facility but have the intimacy and comfort of an indoor arena. With the design for football and the square footage requirements of the rodeo, the building was designed in the {{convert|1.9|e6sqft|m2|adj=on}} range.<ref name="ballparks"/> Groundbreaking for the stadium was on March 9, 2000 and the building was officially [[Topping out|topped off]] in October 2001.<ref name="glasssteelandstone">{{cite web |title=Architecture of Reliant Stadium – Houston, Texas, United States of America|work=Glass, Steel and Stone|accessdate=March 30, 2008|url=http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/US/TX/HoustonReliantStadium.html}}</ref> Construction was completed in 30 months.<ref name="wideopenspaces">{{cite web |title=Wide Open Spaces|first=Brian H.|last=Caudle|url=https://www.aisc.org/globalassets/modern-steel/archives/2003/07/2003v07_wide_open_spaces.pdf|work=[[American Institute of Steel Construction|Modern Steel Construction]]|date=July 2003|accessdate=September 5, 2018}}</ref>

The stadium opened on August 24, 2002, with a preseason game between the [[Miami Dolphins]] and Houston Texans which the Dolphins won 24–3.<ref name="firstgame">{{cite web |title=Texans Team History|url=http://www.houstontexans.com/team/history.html/|publisher=Houston Texans|accessdate=September 17, 2011}}</ref> The stadium hosted its first regular season [[National Football League|NFL]] football game between the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and the Houston Texans on September 8, 2002.<ref name="quickfacts">{{cite web |title=Quick Facts – Reliant Park, Reliant Park Info, Quick Facts|accessdate=March 30, 2008|url=http://www.reliantpark.com/en/cms/?101|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227005819/http://www.reliantpark.com/en/cms/?101|archivedate=February 27, 2008}}</ref> The first rodeo was held in the stadium in February 2003.<ref name="glasssteelandstone"/>

During a Texans preseason game on August 30, 2012, against the [[Minnesota Vikings]], an intoxicated fan fell to his death from an escalator.<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Who Fell from Reliant Stadium Escalator Was Intoxicated|first=Carol|last=Christian|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Man-who-fell-from-Reliant-Stadium-escalator-was-3893229.php|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=September 25, 2012|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}</ref>

On March 19, 2014, the stadium was renamed NRG Stadium, after [[NRG Energy]], the parent company of [[Reliant Energy]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Reliant Park Will Now Be NRG|first=Kiah|last=Collier|url=http://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/Reliant-Park-will-now-be-NRG-5331970.php|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=March 19, 2014|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref>

During the 2015 season, a permanent artificial surface was installed at NRG Stadium. The Texans had used a natural surface since the stadium opened, using a system of trays of sod similar to one used at [[Giants Stadium]] in its experiment with using a grass surface. In recent years, the stadium installed artificial turf to be used during high school and college games while keeping the grass for Texans games. After the Texans' home opener, complaints about the field conditions finally led to the installation of the artificial surface for Texans games. The surface brand is UBU Speed, which is part of [[Act Global]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Texans Unveil New Playing Service at NRG Stadium|first=John|last=McClain|url=https://www.chron.com/sports/texans/article/Texans-unveil-new-playing-service-at-NRG-Stadium-9146479.php|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=August 16, 2016|accessdate=September 5, 2018}}</ref>

In 2017, NRG Stadium selected Hellas Construction to install its Matrix Turf with Helix Technology at the stadium. The three year contract calls for a new turf field each year.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Hellas Installs Turf at NRG Stadium, Named Texans Preferred Turf Provider|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hellas-installs-turf-at-nrg-stadium-named-texans-preferred-turf-provider-300520574.html|publisher=Hellas Construction|date=September 15, 2017|accessdate=September 15, 2017|quote=Hellas Construction was selected this year by Harris County Sports & Convention Corporation (HCSCC) to install a new Matrix® Turf field at NRG Stadium, home of the Houston Texans football team and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo™}}</ref>

After hosting [[Super Bowl LI]], further upgrades were made to keep NRG Stadium competitive with other new NFL venues. The stadium's first major renovation in 15 years modernized the office and team facilities.<ref>https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/columnists/smith/article/Facing-the-reality-of-NRG-Stadium-upgrades-10926138.php</ref><ref>https://footballstadiumdigest.com/2018/06/texans-working-on-nrg-stadium-renovations/</ref><ref>https://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Stradley-Stop-Dome-dreaming-Upgrade-NRG-now-10932633.php</ref><ref>https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2018/08/15/here-s-what-s-new-at-nrg-stadium-for-2018-football.html</ref>

===Hurricane Ike damage===
On the night of September 12–13, 2008 the stadium sustained damage from [[Hurricane Ike]] forcing the [[Houston Texans]] home opener scheduled for September 14 to be postponed. Part of the roof cladding came off, and there was wind and water damage to other sections of the stadium. There were also large pieces of debris inside the stadium from the hurricane and the stadium authority declared that the stadium did not suffer significant structural damage except for the roof, and the Texans would be able to play all of their 8 home games at Reliant Stadium with the roof open.<ref name="ikeespn">{{cite web |title=Damage to Reliant Stadium Forces Rescheduling of Texans-Ravens|first1=Chris|last1=Mortensen|first2=James|last2=Walker|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3585348|work=[[ESPN]]|date=September 14, 2008|accessdate=September 5, 2018}}</ref><ref name="ikerscolts">{{cite news |title=Texans to Host Colts at Reliant Under Open Roof|first=John|last=McClain|url=https://www.chron.com/sports/texans/article/Texans-to-host-Colts-at-Reliant-under-open-roof-1776963.php|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=October 4, 2008|accessdate=September 5, 2018}}</ref>

The Texans' home opener against the [[Baltimore Ravens]] was initially postponed one day from Sunday, September 14, 2008 to Monday, September 15, but when the extent of the damage from Hurricane Ike became known, the NFL rescheduled the Texans-Ravens game to week 10 (November 9, 2008), which was to have been the bye week for the Ravens and the Texans' scheduled home game against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].<ref name="ikeespn"/> That game was rescheduled to week 8 (October 26), which was to have been the bye week for both the Texans and Bengals. The Bengals bye week was moved from October 26 to November 9, originally scheduled for the Ravens. Both the Texans and Ravens took their unexpected bye week in week 2, the weekend Hurricane Ike hit East Texas and the [[Gulf Coast]], despite the fact that both teams were preparing that whole week to play that game as scheduled.

The stadium reopened on October 5, 2008 when the Texans hosted the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and hosted three additional home games in October.<ref name="ikerscolts"/>

The stadium was repaired by Houston-based rope access inspection and construction firm Reel Group Americas on February 13, 2009.

==Design and technology==
[[File:NRGStadiumnew.jpg|thumb|Street view]]
The stadium was designed by the architectural firms of Hermes Reed Architects and [[Lockwood, Andrews and Newnam]] who were teamed to create the Houston Stadium Consultants (HSC). The architects of [[Populous (company)|Populous]] (then HOK Sport) and the HSC worked together with engineers from [[Walter P Moore]] and [[Uni-Systems]] to design the stadium utilizing the principles of [[kinetic architecture]].<ref name="ballparks"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Reliant Stadium Project Details|url=http://www.unidocks.com/Projects/FeaturedProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectID=8&PN=Reliant%20Stadium|publisher=Uni-Systems, Inc.|accessdate=March 30, 2008}}</ref> The facility offers a sense of transparency, with its fabric roof and expansive areas of [[glazing (window)|glazing]]. At night, the building appears to glow from within. The extensive use of glass provides an open-air feel to the [[concourse]]s, which are open to the field of play. NRG Stadium has over 7,000 club seats, 186 [[Luxury box|luxury suite]]s, and multiple lounges and bars.<ref name="nflteamhistory"/> The stadium can be configured to utilize a {{convert|125000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} space for meetings, specialty functions, exhibits, and concerts.<ref name="reliantpark"/>

One of the most notable aspects of the design is the stadium's retractable, fabric roof. The roof mechanization consists of two large panels that split apart at the 50&nbsp;yard line, lying over and above each end zone when fully retracted. 10 parallel, tri-chord [[truss]]es ride on two parallel rails, each supported by a large, {{convert|675|ft|m}}-long super-truss. Roof operation is controlled in the stadium press box via computer, containing live images of the travel path of each roof panel; plus, furnishing live feedback from all roof components throughout the operation. The roof panels can be opened or closed in as little as 7&nbsp;minutes, moving at a speed of up to {{convert|35|ft|m}}-per-minute.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reliant Stadium|url=https://www.aisc.org/globalassets/modern-steel/archives/2004/04/2004v04_reliant.pdf|work=[[American Institute of Steel Construction|Modern Steel Construction]]|date=April 2004|accessdate=March 30, 2008}}</ref>

One bleacher section behind the north [[end zone]], called the "Bull Pen", is the designated fan section for the hometeam. The fans in the Bull Pen interact directly with the action on the field, helping to create and implement fan traditions, songs, chants, and other elements of the game-day experience for spectators all over the stadium. Fans in the Bull Pen are encouraged to stand throughout the game, sing, cheer, and otherwise support the team in an enthusiastic manner.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bull Pen|url=http://www.houstontexans.com/community/BullPen.asp|publisher=Houston Texans|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref>

In 2011, Reliant updated their logo and therefore had to update their signage all over the stadium.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reliant Rebranding|url=http://www.houstontexans.com/tv-media/photo-gallery/Reliant-rebranding/e81a222b-c720-43c9-839f-77001a6cda32#start|publisher=Houston Texans|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref>

In December 2012, it was announced that, in order to help bring the [[Super Bowl]] back to Houston, the stadium's end zone displays would be replaced with the largest digital displays in any professional sports venue. The video screens were revealed August 16, 2013 and are the second largest of their kind, at a total of {{convert|14549|sqft}} of screens. This tops the previous record of [[AT&T Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]]. This has since been topped by the digital display boards located in [[TIAA Bank Field]], the home of the Jacksonville Jaguars, now home to the largest digital display boards in any stadium in the world.<ref>{{cite news |title=Reliant Stadium Will Get Bigger, Better LED Scoreboards|first=Brad|last=Woodard|url=http://www.khou.com/sports/HCSCC-approves-new-LED-scoreboards-for-Reliant-Stadium--184167861.html|work=[[KHOU]]|location=Houston|date=December 20, 2012|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Reliant Stadium to Get Widest Display in Pro Sports|first=Bayan|last=Raji|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/morning_call/2012/12/reliant-stadium-to-get-widest-display.html?ana=RSS&s=article_search|newspaper=Houston Business Journal|date=December 20, 2012|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref>

====Rodeo====
The [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]] (or RodeoHouston) is a [[Concurrent estate|co-tenant]] of NRG Stadium. "The building is as much for the [[rodeo]] as it is for the National Football League," according to Leroy Shafer who is assistant general manager of the rodeo's marketing department.<ref name="rodeo">{{cite news |title=Reliant Stadium: Ready to Rodeo From Design Concept to Showtime|first=Thora|last=Qaddumi|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2003/01/27/focus13.html|newspaper=Houston Business Journal|date=January 26, 2003|accessdate=March 31, 2008}}</ref> The rodeo is held three weeks in March, each year. During this time NRG Stadium also hosts an event on the Xtreme Bulls tour, the bull riding-only tour that is part of the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|PRCA]], who also hosts the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

The stadium includes a service area level to house rodeo [[livestock]]. The bulls, broncs, steers and roping calves are housed in the north end of the stadium under the lower bowl.
