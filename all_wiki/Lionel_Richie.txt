'''Lionel Brockman Richie Jr.''' (born June 20, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, actor, and television judge. His recordings with the [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] band [[Commodores]] and during his solo career made him one of the most successful balladeers of the 1980s.

Beginning in 1968, Richie was a member of the Commodores. The Commodores became established as a popular soul group; their first several albums had a danceable, funky sound, as in such tracks as "[[Machine Gun (Commodores album)|Machine Gun]]" and "[[Brick House (song)|Brick House]]". Over time, Richie wrote and sang more romantic, easy-listening ballads such as "[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]", "[[Three Times a Lady]]", "[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]]", and the breakup ballad "[[Sail On (song)|Sail On]]". Richie launched a solo career in 1982 and his 1982 debut solo album, ''[[Lionel Richie (album)|Lionel Richie]]'', contained three hit singles: the U.S. number-one song "[[Truly (Lionel Richie song)|Truly]]", and the top five hits "[[You Are (Lionel Richie song)|You Are]]" and "[[My Love (Lionel Richie song)|My Love]]". The album hit No. 3 on the music charts and sold over four million copies. His 1983 follow-up album, ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'', sold over twice as many copies, propelling him into the first rank of international superstars.  He also co-wrote the 1985 charity single "[[We Are the World]]" with [[Michael Jackson]], which sold over 20 million copies.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/28/entertainment/feat-we-are-the-world-30-years-where-are-they-now/ | title= 'We Are the World' at 30: Where are they now? | publisher=CNN | first=Todd | last=Leopold | date=January 28, 2015 | access-date=January 8, 2017}}</ref>

==Career==
{{Recentism|date=September 2019}}

===Commodores===
{{Main|Commodores}}
As a student in Tuskegee, Richie formed a succession of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] groups in the mid-1960s. In 1968, he became a singer and saxophonist with the [[Commodores]]. They signed a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1968 for one record before moving on to [[Motown Records]] initially as a support act to [[The Jackson 5]]. The Commodores then became established as a popular soul group. Their first several albums had a danceable, funky sound, as in such tracks as "[[Machine Gun (Commodores album)|Machine Gun]]" and "[[Brick House (song)|Brick House]]." Over time, Richie wrote and sang more romantic, easy-listening ballads such as "[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]", "[[Three Times a Lady]]", "[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]]", and the breakup ballad "[[Sail On (song)|Sail On]]".

In 1974, Richie achieved his first commercial success as a songwriter with "[[Happy People (The Temptations song)|Happy People]]," which he co-wrote with Jeffrey Bowen and Donald Baldwin. Originally intended as a Commodores track, it was recorded by [[The Temptations]], who had their penultimate #1 R&B with the song. By the late 1970s, Richie had begun to accept songwriting commissions from other artists. He composed "[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]" for [[Kenny Rogers]], which hit No. 1 in 1980, and produced Rogers' album ''[[Share Your Love]]'' the following year. Richie and Rogers maintained a strong friendship in later years. Latin jazz composer and [[Salsa music|salsa]] romantica pioneer [[La Palabra (musician)|La Palabra]] enjoyed international success with his cover of "Lady," which was played at Latin dance clubs. Also in 1981 Richie sang the theme song for the film ''[[Endless Love (1981 film)|Endless Love]]'', a duet with [[Diana Ross]]. Issued as a single, the song topped the Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and US pop music charts, and became one of Motown's biggest hits.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Its success encouraged Richie to branch out into a full-fledged solo career in 1982. He was replaced as lead singer for the Commodores by [[Skyler Jett]] in 1983.

===Solo career===
Richie's 1982 debut solo album, ''[[Lionel Richie (album)|Lionel Richie]]'', contained three hit singles: the U.S. number-one song "[[Truly (Lionel Richie song)|Truly]]", which continued the style of his ballads with the Commodores and launched his career as one of the most successful balladeers of the 1980s, and the top five hits "[[You Are (Lionel Richie song)|You Are]]" and "[[My Love (Lionel Richie song)|My Love]]". The album hit No. 3 on the music charts and sold over 4 million copies. His 1983 follow-up album, ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'', sold over twice as many copies and won two [[Grammy Award]]s, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], propelling him into the first rank of international superstars. The album contained the number-one hit "[[All Night Long (All Night)|All Night Long]]" a Caribbean-flavored dance number that was promoted by a colorful music video produced by former [[The Monkees|Monkee]] [[Michael Nesmith]]. In 1984, he performed "All Night Long" at the closing ceremony of the [[XXIII Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles.

Several more Top 10 hits followed, the most successful of which was the ballad "[[Hello (Lionel Richie song)|Hello]]" (1984), a sentimental love song that showed how far he had moved from his R&B roots. Richie had three more top ten hits in 1984, "[[Stuck on You (Lionel Richie song)|Stuck on You]]" (#3), "[[Running with the Night]]" (#7) and "[[Penny Lover]]" (#8), as well as writing & producing "Missing You" for former labelmate and duet partner Diana Ross (#10 Pop, #1 R&B). In 1985, he wrote and performed "[[Say You, Say Me]]" for the film ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]''. The song won an [[Academy Award]] and reached No. 1 on the U.S. charts, staying there for four weeks, making it the number-two song of 1986 according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Year-End Hot 100 chart, behind the charity single "[[That's What Friends Are For]]" by [[Dionne Warwick|Dionne]] and Friends. He also collaborated with [[Michael Jackson]] on the charity single "[[We Are the World]]" by [[USA for Africa]], another number-one hit.

In 1986, Richie released ''[[Dancing on the Ceiling]]'', his last widely popular album, which produced a run of five US and UK hits, "[[Say You, Say Me]]" (U.S. #1), "[[Dancing on the Ceiling (Lionel Richie song)|Dancing on the Ceiling]]" (U.S. #2), "[[Love Will Conquer All]]" (U.S. #9), "[[Ballerina Girl]]" (U.S. #7), and "[[Se La]]" (U.S. #20). He made his return to recording and performing following the release of his first greatest-hits collection, ''[[Back to Front (Lionel Richie album)|Back to Front]]'', in 1992.

Since then, his ever-more-relaxed schedule has kept his recording and live work to a minimum. He broke the silence in 1996 with ''[[Louder Than Words (album)|Louder Than Words]]'', on which he resisted any change of style or the musical fashion-hopping of the past decade, sticking instead with his chosen path of well-crafted [[soul music]], which in the intervening years has become known as [[contemporary R&B]].

Richie's albums in the 1990s such as ''[[Louder Than Words (album)|Louder Than Words]]'' and ''[[Time (Lionel Richie album)|Time]]'' failed to match the commercial success of his earlier work. Some of his recent albums, such as ''[[Renaissance (Lionel Richie album)|Renaissance]]'', have returned to his older style and achieved success in Europe but only modest notice in the United States.

===Later career===

Richie was the headliner at a 2006 Fourth of July tribute concert with [[Fantasia Barrino]] at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. On May 7, 2006, Richie performed on the main stage (Acura Stage) at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]], replacing [[Antoine "Fats" Domino]], who had fallen ill. Richie released his eighth studio album titled "[[Coming Home (Lionel Richie album)|Coming Home]]" on September 12, 2006. The first single of the album was "[[I Call It Love]]" and was premiered in July 2006, becoming his biggest hit in the U.S. in ten years. The album was a big success for Richie in the United States, peaking at No. 6.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

On May 2, 2008, Richie was the 21st recipient of the ''[[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] [[Lifetime Achievement Award]]'' at [[UCLA]]'s annual [[UCLA Spring Sing|Spring Sing]]. In accepting the award, Richie said: "Forget about surviving 30 some odd years in the music business, Lionel Richie survived 27 years of Nicole Richie."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/electronicplay.aspx?fid=24831&id=E0C5478 |title=Richie accepts Gershwin Award |publisher=Newsroom.UCLA.edu |date=May 2, 2008 |access-date=May 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927220036/http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/electronicplay.aspx?fid=24831&id=E0C5478 |archive-date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref>

==Personal life==

[[File:LionelRitchieMar2011.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Richie performing in March 2011]]
On October 18, 1975, Richie married his college sweetheart, Brenda Harvey. In 1983, the couple informally adopted Nicole Camille Escovedo (now [[Nicole Richie]]), the two-year-old daughter of a member of Lionel's band who was also the niece of drummer [[Sheila E]]. The Richies raised Nicole as their daughter and adopted her legally when she was nine years old.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

In 1986, while still married to Harvey, Richie began a relationship with Diane Alexander.  He later separated from Harvey, who in 1988 allegedly discovered Richie and Alexander together in a [[Beverly Hills]] hotel room by saying she was "room service."{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  In June 1988, Harvey was arrested and charged with corporal injury to a spouse, resisting arrest, trespassing, vandalism, battery, and disturbing the peace after she found Richie at Alexander's Beverly Hills apartment.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=July 18, 1988|title=Summertime, and the Loving Is Anything but Easy for Lionel, Melvin and Stephanie|url=https://people.com/archive/summertime-and-the-loving-is-anything-but-easy-for-lionel-melvin-and-stephanie-vol-30-no-3/|journal=People|volume= 30| issue = 3}}</ref>  Richie and Harvey divorced on August 9, 1993, after nearly 18 years of marriage.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|website=imdb.com|title= Biography â€“ Lionel Richie |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005360/bio|access-date= July 26, 2007}}</ref>

Richie suffered prolonged throat problems and had surgery four times in four years before being told by [[conventional medicine|conventional doctors]] that he could lose his singing career.
