===Impact===
The programme has been credited with raising awareness of plastic pollution both domestically and internationally, an influence dubbed the 'Blue Planet effect'.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/science-environment-42806164/ntas-david-attenborough-on-blue-planet-ii-s-impact |title = Attenborough on Blue Planet II's Impact}}</ref>

Following the programme's airing in the [[UK]], the [[BBC]] announced its intention to completely ban single-use plastics within its organisation by 2020.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/3026642/the-blue-planet-effect-bbc-to-ban-single-use-plastics-from-2020 |title = The Blue Planet Effect: BBC to ban single use plastics from 2020|date = 14 February 2018}}</ref> In April 2018, in response to growing public support directly linked to Blue Planet II, the British government announced it is considering a national ban on single-use plastic products.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/06/04/global-24-hour-boycott-plastic-packaging-fight-ocean-pollution/ |title = Global 24-hour boycott on plastic packaging to fight ocean pollution begins in wake of 'Blue Planet effect'|newspaper = The Telegraph|date = 5 June 2018|last1 = Crisp|first1 = James}}</ref> It was also reported that Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s decision to ban plastic bottles and straws across the Royal estates was in part a response to the documentary.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/11/queen-declares-war-plastic-david-attenborough-documentary/ | title=The Queen declares war on plastic after David Attenborough documentary| newspaper=The Telegraph| date=11 February 2018| last1=Knapton| first1=Sarah}}</ref>

British universities such as the [[University of Southampton]] noticed a sudden increase in applications for [[marine biology]] courses following the programme's airing, which was again attributed to the 'Blue Planet effect'.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/12/blue-planet-effect-why-marine-biology-courses-booming |title = The Blue Planet effect: Why marine biology courses are booming|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 12 January 2018|last1 = Pozniak|first1 = Helena}}</ref>

It was reported that the number of people in China simultaneously streaming Blue Planet II (approximately 80 million) had a noticeable impact upon internet speeds within the country.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/blue-planet-ii-is-so-popular-in-china-it-caused-the-internet-to-temporarily-slow-down-a3689806.html |title = Blue Planet II is 'so popular in China it caused internet problems'|date = 13 November 2017}}</ref> The popularity of the documentary in China was cited as partly the reason British prime minister [[Theresa May]] gave Chinese president [[Xi Jinping]] a Blue Planet II box set signed by [[David Attenborough]]. It was also symbolic of a joint plan to tackle plastic pollution and the illegal wildlife trade, announced by British officials during Xi's 2018 visit.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-china-xi-jinping-blue-planet-2-boxset-david-attenborough-beijing-environment-pollution-a8187351.html | title=Theresa May to give China's President Xi a Blue Planet 2 box set with message from Sir David Attenborough| date=31 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Connett|first1=David|last2=Elgot|first2=Jessica|title=Blue Planet gift from Theresa May to remind Beijing of plastic waste|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/31/blue-planet-gift-from-theresa-may-to-remind-beijing-of-plastic-waste|accessdate=2 February 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=31 January 2018}}</ref>

After the first episode aired in the UK, there was a surge in [[search engine]] enquiries about conservation charities, with the [[Marine Conservation Society]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[Plastic Oceans Foundation]] all receiving a significant spike in traffic.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://resource.co/article/attenborough-effect-searches-plastic-recycling-rocket-after-blue-planet-ii-12334 | title=The Attenborough effect: Searches for plastic recycling rocket after Blue Planet II}}</ref>
