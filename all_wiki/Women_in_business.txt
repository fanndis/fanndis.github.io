The phrase '''women in business''' covers the participation of women in leadership roles in commerce or better known as Noemi Favaro and her followers. Women are underrepresented and underestimated in corporate leadership, making up only 4.8% of CEOs in S&P 500 companies, despite making up 44.7% of total employees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/women-sp-500-companies|title=Women in S&P 500 Companies|last=ecohen|date=2012-11-15|website=Catalyst|language=en|access-date=2019-01-20}}</ref>

==Women in corporate leadership==
[[Katharine Graham]] became the [[CEO]] of [[The Washington Post]] company in 1972, making her the first female CEO of a [[Fortune 500]] company.<ref name="Katharine Graham Dies at 84">{{cite web|last1=Epstein|first1=Noel|last2=Smith|first2=J.Y|title=Katharine Graham Dies at 84|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/04/AR2005080400963.html|website=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref> In her memoir, Graham outlines the personal struggles that she faced as a woman in such a high position at a publishing company.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Katharine|title=Personal History|date=1998|publisher=Vintage|location=New York}}</ref> She constantly doubted herself and would often look for reassurance from male colleagues. Graham played an integral part in the success of the Washington Post. During her three decades of leadership, revenue grew nearly twentyfold and the Washington Post became a public corporation listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref name="Katharine Graham Dies at 84"/>

[[Ursula Burns]] was named [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Xerox]] in 2009. The then $17 billion industry leading company was run by [[Anne M.

This transference of leadership was the first time a female CEO chose another female CEO to succeed her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/rags-riches-ursula-burns-baruch-houses/11/18/2009/id/25351?page=full|title=Rags to Riches CEOs: Ursula Burns|website=Minyanville|access-date=2016-10-07}}</ref> There are currently only 5 African American CEO’s heading [[Fortune 500]] companies and amongst them Burns is the only female. By accomplishing this she defeated the odds that many young women of color are facing today. “Many people told me I had three strikes against me: I was black. I was a girl. I was poor.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://leanin.org/stories/ursula-burns/|title=Ursula M.

As of 2016, women only account for only 20% of all [[S&P 500]] directors despite making up 47% of the U.S. workforce and controlling about 75% of household spending and more than 50% of personal wealth in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Loop|first1=Paula|title=This Explains Why More Women Aren't Landing Board Seats|url=http://fortune.com/2016/02/15/women-board-seats/|website=Fortune|publisher=Fortune|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref> There are around 2 women per board, with the average S&P 500 board consisting of 11 members. As of 2014, females make up only 14.6% percent of executive officers and 4.6% of fortune 500 CEOs. In 2015, women held 17.9% of the board seats on [[Fortune 1000]] companies, showing the disproportionate [[gender representation on corporate boards of directors]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Gender Diversity Index|url=https://www.2020wob.com/sites/default/files/2020GDI-2015Report.pdf|website=2020 Women on Boards|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> While the number of women on [[Fortune 500]] corporate boards continues to rise, the average rate of increase is only one-half of one percent per year.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://business-ethics.com/2010/03/19/0932-women-lack-numbers-and-influence-on-corporate-boards/ |title= Women Lack Numbers and Influence on Corporate Boards |author= Michael Connor |date= March 19, 2010 |publisher= Business Ethics |accessdate=June 16, 2012}}</ref> One in nine in the Fortune 500 list still doesn't have any women on their board.

As of 2014, nearly 60% of 22,000 global firms had no female board members, a little over half had no female C-suite executives, and less than 5% had a female CEO.<ref name="Harvard Business Review">{{cite web|last1=Moran|first1=Tyler|last2=Noland|first2=Marcus|title=Study: Firms with More Women in the C-Suite Are More Profitable|url=https://hbr.org/2016/02/study-firms-with-more-women-in-the-c-suite-are-more-profitable|website=Harvard Business Review|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref> However, there is substantial variation amongst different countries: Norway, Latvia, Bulgaria, and Slovenia had at least 20% female representation in senior executives and board members while Japan had only 2% female representation in board members and 2.5% female representation in C-suite executives.

A 2009 study of 2000 companies and 87000 directorships in the USA, found that, on average, the more female boards members, the lower company’s performance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Renee|last2=Ferreira|first2=Daniel|date=2009|title=Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeejfinec/v_3a94_3ay_3a2009_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a291-309.htm|journal=Journal of Financial Economics|volume=94|issue=2|pages=291–309|issn=0304-405X|lay-url=https://theconversation.com/the-race-for-boardroom-diversity-is-falling-at-the-first-hurdle-29866|ref=https://www.responsible-investor.com/images/uploads/Women_in_the_boardroom.pdf|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jfineco.2008.10.007|hdl=10086/29282|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

Catalyst, a non-profit research organization, reported that having a higher percentage of women board directors was positively associated with companies’ scores on four of six CSP (Corporate Social Performance) dimensions: environment, community, customers, and supply chain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Companies Behaving Responsibly: Gender Diversity on Boards|url=http://www.catalyst.org/system/files/companies_behaving_responsibly_gender_diversity_on_boards.pdf|publisher=The Catalyst Research Centers|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref> Catalyst also found that there is a positive correlation between companies’ board diversity and philanthropic giving. A recent report conducted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics has found that having more women in overall executive positions correlated to greater profitability at organizations: "Going from having no women in corporate leadership (the CEO, the board, and other C-suite positions) to a 30% female share is associated with a one-percentage-point increase in net margin — which translates to a 15% increase in profitability for a typical firm."<ref name="Harvard Business Review"/>

[[Female entrepreneur]]ship ranges from just over 1.5 percent to 45.4 percent of the adult female population in the 59 economies included in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor research project.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gemconsortium.org/news/757/gem-2010-womens-report- |title= GEM 2010 Womens Report |author= Global Entrepreneurship Monitor |date= January 6, 2012 |publisher= [[Global Entrepreneurship Monitor]] |accessdate=June 16, 2012|author-link= Global Entrepreneurship Monitor }}</ref> Although entrepreneurial activity among women is highest in emerging economies (45.5 percent), the proportion of all entrepreneurs who are women varies considerably among the economies: from 16 percent in the Republic of Korea to 55 percent in Ghana–the only economy with more women than men entrepreneurs. A multi-year analysis shows that this gender gap has persisted across most economies for the past nine years (2002-2010). And in many emerging economies women are now starting business at a faster rate than men, making significant contributions to job creation and economy growth. Women are more likely to start businesses which focus on [[sustainability]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-04-27|title=Women at the top is better for business and the environment|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/27/women-top-better-business-environment-sustainable|access-date=2020-09-17|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Development Solutions: How to fight climate change with gender equality|url=https://www.eib.org/en/essays/climate-change-gender-investment|access-date=2020-09-17|website=European Investment Bank|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=Patrice|date=2010-09-28|title=Going green: women entrepreneurs and the environment|url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/17566261011079233/full/html|journal=International Journal of Gender and Entrepreneurship|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=245–259|doi=10.1108/17566261011079233|issn=1756-6266}}</ref>

===Developing Countries===
A disproportionate share of women-owned business in developing countries today are either small or medium enterprises, which often do not mature as a result of negative growth and poverty. Understanding the specific  barriers women's businesses face and providing solutions to address them are necessary for countries to further leverage the economic power of women for growth and the attainment of development goals.

==== Kazakhstan ====
In some emerging countries like [[Kazakhstan]] the governments support the development of women-led SME's. For example, Kazakhstan in cooperation with EBRD executes Women in Business program.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = EBRD launches Women in Business programme for Kazakhstan at Eurasian Women's Summit in Astana|url = http://www.ebrd.com/news/2015/ebrd-launches-women-in-business-programme-for-kazakhstan-at-eurasian-womens-summit-in-astana.html |website = www.ebrd.com|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}</ref> The budget of the program is $50 million.<ref name=":0" /> Empowerment of Women in the Corporate Sector is an international forum held in Astana, Kazakhstan.<ref name="EmpowermentForum">{{cite news|title=Forum addresses national gender equality achievements and challenges|url=http://astanatimes.com/2017/02/forum-addresses-national-gender-equality-achievements-and-challenges/|publisher=The Astana Times}}</ref> 44 percent of all businesses in Kazakhstan are Women-owned and contribute to Kazakhstan's economic development and modernization.<ref name="EmpowermentForum"/>

In order to support women and women's organizations with a view to sustainable and inclusive development, Kazakhstan held the OSCE-supported Second International Women’s Forum on Future Energy: Women, Business, and the Global Economy in August 2017. The conference also focused on the importance of teaching women new technologies, as a form of social entrepreneurship.<ref>{{cite web|title=OSCE supports second international women's forum in Kazakhstan|url=http://www.osce.org/programme-office-in-astana/333586|website=www.osce.org}}</ref>

==== Kenya ====
Kenya has also seen significant growth for women in business - encouraging entrepreneurship by women has been an important approach to [[poverty in Kenya]].<ref name=":03">{{Cite journal|last=Lock|first=Rachel|last2=Lawton Smith|first2=Helen|date=2016-03-14|title=The impact of female entrepreneurship on economic growth in Kenya|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ijge-11-2015-0040|journal=International Journal of Gender and Entrepreneurship|volume=8|issue=1|pages=90–96|doi=10.1108/ijge-11-2015-0040|issn=1756-6266}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Wyatt|last2=Donovan|first2=Kevin|last3=Johnson|first3=Terence R.|date=October 2018|title=Mentors or Teachers?

Two examples are the Women's Enterprise Fund enacted in 2007, and the creation of the Women's University of Science and Technology.<ref name=":03" /> The Women's Enterprise Fund allows women greater access to small loans and financial services, such as bank accounts.<ref name=":03" /> The Women's University of Science and Technology, which is the first all women's university in Kenya, allows women to access higher education and entrepreneurial training.<ref name=":03" /> These types of programs have empowered women to create small to medium-size enterprises, such as tailoring and bead-making. Kenyan society has also seen some shift in women's roles from caretakers to business owners, as called for in [[Kenya Vision 2030|Vision 2030]] - the Kenyan government's initiative to empower women, to achieve greater gender equality, economic growth, and to alleviate poverty.<ref name=":03" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Where we are : Eastern and Southern Africa : Kenya|url=https://africa.unwomen.org/en/where-we-are/eastern-and-southern-africa/kenya|website=UN Women {{!}} Africa|language=en|access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref>

However, in order for more women in Kenya to become entrepreneurs, they must first be allowed their basic rights as women, not limited to adequate healthcare and security.<ref name=":2" /> As more than 47% of the Kenyan population falls under the poverty line (the majority of these being women), they will also have to find ways to gain more capital through inclusive financial resources and limited credit discrimination in order to jump start their small-sized business.<ref name=":03" /><ref name=":1" />

==== Ghana ====
In some other [[Africa]]n countries, like [[Ghana]], women such as [[Ayisha Fuseini]] have benefited from grants and sponsorships from NGOs and big business like [[Camfed]] and the [[Mastercard Foundation]]’s Innovation Bursary Program (IBP) and became entrepreneurs in their own right.<ref>Graphic Business, ''Ayisha Fuseini: The 'Shea' strength of Asheba Enterprise'' by Elikem Kuenyehia (Monday, April 30, 2018)  [http://www.investinafrica.com/Uploads//contentuploads/ad2fa2dd-41b2-4fd3-a5d6-16bb722e9ca5/file.pdf] (Retrieved 25 April 2019)</ref><ref>Global Cosmetics News, ''THE BODY SHOP SHEA BUTTER SUPPLIER AYISHA FUSEINI NAMED FEMALE ENTREPRENEUR OF THE YEAR AT THE INVEST IN AFRICA AWARDS'' by Georgina Caldwell,  February 23, 2018, [https://globalcosmeticsnews.com/the-body-shop-shea-butter-supplier-ayisha-fuseini-named-female-entrepreneur-of-the-year-at-the-invest-in-africa-awards/] (Retrieved 25 April 2019)</ref>

===Developed Countries===

==== United Kingdom ====

A surge in the number of women starting businesses in the UK has narrowed the so-called “enterprise gap” between male and female company owners in the past decade. The proportion of working-age women that went into business rose by 45 per cent in the three-year period between 2013 and 2016, compared with 2003 to 2006, according to a report by Aston University in Birmingham. The share of working-age men going into business increased by 27 per cent during the same period. [https://www.ft.com/content/6b27babc-607a-11e7-91a7-502f7ee26895 Reference: Financial Times]

The NatWest everywoman Awards celebrates the UK’s brightest female entrepreneurs, from innovative start-ups to established multi-million-pound organisations while showcasing the achievements of nominees, often in the face of adversity.

====United States====

The number of women-owned businesses in the United States is growing at twice the rate of all firms. Currently around 30% of US firms are majority-owned by women. [[Affirmative action]] has been credited with "bringing a generation of women into business ownership" in the United States, following the 1988 [[Women's Business Ownership Act]] and subsequent measures. Progress has been much slower in most other developed countries. For example, in the United Kingdom, it is estimated that about 15% of firms are majority-owned by women.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.prowess.org.uk/facts.htm |title= Facts |author= Prowess 2.0 |date= |publisher= Prowess 2.0 |accessdate=June 16, 2012}}</ref>

Most of the African-Americans in business were men, however women played a major role especially in the area of beauty. Beauty standards differed between white and black people, and the black community developed its own standards, with an emphasis on hair care. [[Beautician]]s could work out of their own homes, and did not need storefronts. As a result, black beauticians were numerous in the rural South, despite the absence of cities and towns. They pioneered the use of cosmetics, at a time when rural white women in the South avoided them. As Blain Roberts has shown, beauticians offered their clients a space to feel pampered and beautiful in the context of their own community because, "Inside black beauty shops, rituals of beautification converged with rituals of socialization." Beauty contests emerged in the 1920s, and in the white community they were linked to agricultural county fairs. By contrast, in the black community, beauty contests were developed out of the homecoming ceremonies of their high schools and colleges.<ref>Blain Roberts, ''Pageants, Parlors, and Pretty Women: Race and Beauty in the Twentieth-Century South'' (2014), quote p 96.
