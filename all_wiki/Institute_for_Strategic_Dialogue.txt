== Approach ==
[[File:Sasha-Havlicek-2018.png|thumb|ISD's CEO Sasha Havlicek speaking at the Global Summit on Homegrown Violent Extremism<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-EiHYfDWz8|title=Global Summit on Homegrown Violent Extremism: Keynote - Sasha Havlicek|date= 2017 |publisher= USC Sol Price School of Public Policy| via= YouTube}}</ref>]]
ISD's approach is to counter extremism and the ideologies that underpin it in ways that are practical, affordable, effective, and scalable. ISD operates through five interconnected pillars of work:

* Research & Insight: ISD research combines in-depth analysis of audience, networks and content to accurately interpret the threat of violent extremism online and offline. ISD research has been consistently ahead of the curve, predicting developments in extremism and informing responses to emerging challenges. It has helped to reveal previously unseen challenges, enabling us and others to design effective and forward thinking programmes.
* Communication & technology: ISD works on the application of data, technology and marketing tactics to mount proportional responses to extremist messaging. ISD leads major programmes with Facebook, Google and Microsoft.
* Education: ISD’s innovative global education programmes and resources build the resilience of young people to extremism through the development of vital skills, from critical thinking to social and emotional learning. ISD research has shown that education plays a critical role in undermining extremist ideologies and support for extremist groups, disrupting their activities at the roots.
* Grassroots networks: Extremism is a global phenomenon that is ill served by top-down approaches. Isd works to empower and facilitate independent, grassroots networks to take the lead at the front lines, applying their local expertise and credibility in a way that delivers impact at scale.
* Policy & advisory: ISD provides strategic advice to over 15 governments and 100 cities worldwide, allowing us to facilitate the exchange of best practice between policy-makers and practitioners to coordinate counter-extremism programmes. ISD also provides high-level strategic advice to the tech sector to harmonise efforts with governments and civil society.

=== Strong Cities Network ===
[[File:Launch-of-the-Strong-Cities-Network.jpg|thumb|Launch of the Strong Cities Network in 2015]]
Launched at the United Nations in September 2015, the Strong Cities Network (SCN) is the first ever global network of mayors, municipal-level policy makers and practitioners united in building social cohesion and community resilience to counter violent extremism in all its forms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://strongcitiesnetwork.org/about-the-scn/|title=Strong Cities Network|website= strongcitiesnetwork.org}}</ref>

Led by ISD and comprising more than 100 cities, the SCN builds collaboration between mayors, political actors and frontline teams to tackle polarisation, hate and violence in local communities in every major global region. The network catalyses, inspires and multiplies community-centered approaches and action to counter violent extremism through peer learning and expert training. It operates with a set of fundamental principles, agreed by all members, that protect and promote human rights and civil liberties in all aspects of its work to prevent violent extremism.

[[File:Internet Citizens.jpg|right|thumb|267x267px|Be Internet Citizens billboard in [[London Underground]] ]]
In 2017, ISD delivered a series of 'Be Internet Citizen workshops' youth centres across the UK in 2017. In 2018 ISD started working with Google to roll out the workshops into schools across the country, as well as supporting teachers and the youth sector with training and resources to deliver the curriculum independently.

The Internet Citizens Curriculum aims to explain fake news, echo chambers and filter bubbles, helping young people become more confident in forming their opinions online and develop an increased critical awareness of the use of the content they consume
