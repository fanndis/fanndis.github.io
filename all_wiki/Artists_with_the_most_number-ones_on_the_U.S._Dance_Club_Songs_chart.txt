Madonna's first two dance chart entries, "[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]" in 1982 and "[[Burning Up (Madonna song)|Burning Up]]" in 1983, both peaked at number three. Her first chart-topper came later in 1983, when the [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double-sided]] 12-inch single "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]"/"[[Lucky Star (Madonna song)|Lucky Star]]" spent five weeks at the summit.  This remains as Madonna's longest-running number-one.  Her second album ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' produced three chart-toppers during 1984 — 1985: [[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]", "[[Material Girl]]" and "[[Angel (Madonna song)|Angel]]"/"[[Into the Groove]]".  "Into the Groove", originally recorded for the film ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'', was later added to the ''Like a Virgin'' album when it was re-issued in non-U.S. territories.  "[[Open Your Heart (Madonna song)|Open Your Heart]]" and "[[Causing a Commotion]]" (from the soundtrack ''[[Who's That Girl (soundtrack)|Who's That Girl]]'') were both number-ones in 1987.  The remix album ''[[You Can Dance]]'' topped the club songs chart in 1988 (''Billboard'' policy at the time allowed full albums or EPs to chart).  Madonna closed out the 1980s with three more number-ones from her album ''[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]'': [[Like a Prayer (song)|The title track]], "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]" and "[[Keep It Together (Madonna song)|Keep It Together]]" (in early 1990).

"[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]" became Madonna's eleventh dance number-one in 1990, followed by "[[Justify My Love]]" in 1991.  Her ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' album produced three more chart-toppers ("[[Erotica (song)|Erotica]]", "[[Deeper and Deeper]]" and "[[Fever (Madonna song)|Fever]]").  By the time the ''[[Bedtime Stories (Madonna album)|Bedtime Stories]]'' album spun off two more number-ones ("[[Secret (Madonna song)|Secret]]" and "[[Bedtime Story (Madonna song)|Bedtime Story]]"), Madonna had more number-ones than any other artist in the history of the chart.  Dance remixes of "[[Don't Cry for Me Argentina#Madonna version|Don't Cry for Me Argentina]]", from the ''[[Evita (soundtrack)|Evita]]'' soundtrack, gave Madonna her eighteenth number-one in 1997.  In the late 1990s she continued to top the chart with "[[Frozen (Madonna song)|Frozen]]", "[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]", "[[Nothing Really Matters]]" and "[[Beautiful Stranger]]".  A cover version of [[Don McLean]]'s "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]" hit number one in 2000.

Madonna's ''[[Music (Madonna album)|Music]]'' album became the first from the artist to produce four number-one dance hits: "[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]", "[[Don't Tell Me (Madonna song)|Don't Tell Me]]", "[[What It Feels Like for a Girl]]" and "[[Impressive Instant]]".  She bested this with her ''[[American Life]]'' album, with seven singles released during 2002–2004, five of which reached number one ("[[Die Another Day (song)|Die Another Day]]", "[[American Life (song)|American Life]]", "[[Hollywood (Madonna song)|Hollywood]]", "[[Nothing Fails]]" and "[[Love Profusion]]").  In the midst of this string, Madonna had another chart-topper — her only as a featured artist — on [[Britney Spears]]'s "[[Me Against the Music]]" in 2003.  She again produced four chart-toppers from an album, when "[[Hung Up]]", "[[Sorry (Madonna song)|Sorry]]", "[[Get Together (Madonna song)|Get Together]]" and "[[Jump (Madonna song)|Jump]]" (from ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'') became dance number-ones during 2005–2006.  A collaboration with [[Justin Timberlake]], "[[4 Minutes (Madonna song)|4 Minutes]]", became Madonna's thirty-eighth number-one in 2008, followed by "[[Give It 2 Me (Madonna song)|Give It 2 Me]]" (both from the ''[[Hard Candy (Madonna album)|Hard Candy]]'' album). A career retrospective, ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]'', gave her a record-extending 40th number-one ("[[Celebration (Madonna song)|Celebration]]").

Madonna's ''[[MDNA (album)|MDNA]]'' given her three more number-one dance hits: "[[Give Me All Your Luvin']]" (featuring [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[M.I.A.

== Eighth: Donna Summer (16) ==
[[File:Nobel Peace Price Concert 2009 Donna Summer3.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|alt=With long brown hair, a woman smiles and holds a microphone, wearing a black outfit.|Summer in December 2009]]

American singer and songwriter [[Donna Summer]] achieved 14 number-one songs on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs chart between 1976 and 2010 before dying in May 2012, and ranked sixth among the top 100 Dance Club Songs artists overall. Summer gained her sixteenth number-one posthumously in 2018 with "Hot Stuff 2018".  Summer's first two chart-toppers ("[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]" and "[[Try Me, I Know We Can Make It]]") occurred in 1975–1976, when ''Billboard'' published multiple dance charts that were city-specific.  During this time, ''Billboard'' rival publication ''[[Record World]]'' compiled a nationwide dance chart.  Noted ''Billboard'' statistician [[Joel Whitburn]] has since "adopted" ''Record World''s chart data from the weeks between March 29, 1975 and August 21, 1976 into ''Billboard''s club play history.  ''Billboard'' columnists, however, only credit Summer with 16 number-ones.

Summer, known widely as the "Queen of [[Disco]]", charted several full-length albums on the dance chart, as ''Billboard'' policy at the time allowed this (a common practice in the disco era was to segue together several cuts on a side of a vinyl album to replicate a night at a discothèque).  In 1977, Summer hit number one with three different albums: ''[[Four Seasons of Love]]'', ''[[I Remember Yesterday]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Time (Donna Summer album)|Once Upon a Time]]''.  Her eighth dance chart number-one was "[[Hot Stuff (Donna Summer song)|Hot Stuff]]"/"[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer song)|Bad Girls]]", two songs that were joined together on her album ''[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer album)|Bad Girls]]''.  These two songs were released separately as singles and both were also number-ones on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].  Summer has also hit number one twice with "[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]" — once in 1978 and again with a remix in 2013; her last number one before her passing was in 2010 with "[[To Paris with Love (song)|To Paris with Love]]."  She has had at least one number-one dance hit during the 1970s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s.

===Dave Audé===
American musician, remixer, songwriter, and producer [[Dave Audé]] has amassed 14 number ones on the Dance Club Songs chart, making him the only producer on this list to achieve this feat, as well as the only non-singing artist on this list, although if his side project JX Riders is factored in, he actually would have 15 due to having topped the chart with his cover of "Sweet Dreams" during the week of September 10, 2016.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7495452/lindsey-stirling-scores-third-no-1-dance-electronic-albums "Lindsey Stirling Scores Third No. 1 on Top Dance/Electronic Albums Chart"] from Billboard (September 1, 2016)</ref> He joined this threshold during the week of February 25, 2017, when his updated version of the 2006 [[Bodyrox]] single "[[Yeah Yeah (Bodyrox song)|Yeah Yeah]]," with the song's original vocalist [[Luciana (singer)|Luciana]], reached the top spot.

With a total of 14 chart toppers, Enrique Iglesias, who is 14th among the top 100 Dance Club Songs Artist overall, is the only male artist with the most number-one songs on the Dance Club Play chart so far, although Dave Audé would tie him in February 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6274160/chart-highlights-fergie-returns-enrique-iglesias-hits-no-1|title=Chart Highlights: Fergie Returns, Enrique Iglesias Hits No. 1 – October 06, 2014|work=Billboard|date=October 6, 2014|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}</ref>

His first entry on this chart was also his first Hot 100 number-one: "[[Bailamos]]" in 1999 from his ''[[Enrique (album)|Enrique]]'' album.  The following year "[[Be with You (Enrique Iglesias song)|Be With You]]" was the second song from that album to hit the top of the chart.  In December 2001 "[[Hero (Enrique Iglesias song)|Hero]]" from his album ''[[Insomniac (Enrique Iglesias album)|Insomniac]]'' hit number one.

During 2013 "[[Turn The Night Up]]" extended his record.  "[[Bailando (Enrique Iglesias song)|Bailando]]", featuring [[Descemer Bueno]] and [[Gente de Zona]], became his thirteenth number one in 2014. On the week ending September 17, 2016, Iglesias broke out of a three way tie among male artists with the most number ones at Dance Club songs with his second Spanish-language track "[[Duele el Corazón]]" featuring [[Wisin]]. One of the several "Duele el Corazon" remixes that was played in clubs was also remixed by Audé. When ''Billboard'' asked Iglesias about making history on this chart, the Spanish-born singer/songwriter came up with this explanation: "No. 1 on the Dance Chart... And I don't dance. Quite amazing, if you ask me!"<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7502704/enrique-iglesias-14th-number-1-dance-club-songs-chart-record "Enrique Iglesias Celebrates 14th No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart -- The Most Among Men"] from Billboard (September 7, 2016)</ref>

In 2019, ten years after her previous Billboard Dance number-one, “Million Dollar Bill", Houston posthumously scored her 14th. Norwegian DJ Kygo remixed Houston's Japan-exclusive 1990 version of “Higher Love”, which entered the top spot on issue date August 24, 2019.
