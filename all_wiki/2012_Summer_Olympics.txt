the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Belgian [[Jacques Rogge]], who was succeeded by German [[Thomas Bach]] the next year.

The final medal tally was led by the [[United States at the 2012 Summer Olympics|United States]], followed by [[China at the 2012 Summer Olympics|China]] and host [[Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]]. Several world and Olympic records were set at the games. Though there were several controversies, the 2012 games were deemed highly successful with the rising standards of competition amongst nations across the world, packed stadiums and smooth organisation. Furthermore, the focus on sporting legacy and post-games venue sustainability was seen as a blueprint for future Olympics.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

On 6 June 2005, the IOC released its evaluation reports for the five candidate cities. They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive.

The [[Government Olympic Executive]] (GOE), a unit within the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS), was the lead government body for coordinating the London 2012 Olympics. It focused on oversight of the Games, cross-programme programme management and the [[London 2012 Olympic Legacy]] before and after the Games that would benefit London and the United Kingdom. The organisation was also responsible for the supervision of the £9.3&nbsp;billion of public sector funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/2012_olympic_games_and_paralympic_games/default.aspx|title=2012 Olympic Games & Paralympic Games|publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport|accessdate=15 October 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026041400/http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/2012_olympic_games_and_paralympic_games/default.aspx|archivedate=26 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games used a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and [[Horse Guards Parade]].

===International transport===
The 2012 games were a unique operational task and a massive challenge for Heathrow airport.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} A temporary terminal was created at Heathrow Airport, to be used by 10,100 departing athletes after the games. Up to 35% more bags than normal were expected on 13 August, which was predicted to be the busiest day in the airport's history, according to Nick Cole, head of Olympic and Paralympic planning at Heathrow.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Cost and financing===
A study from Oxford University found that the sports-related costs of London 2012 was US$15 billion, compared to $4.6 billion for Rio 2016, $40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and $51 billion for Sochi 2014, the most expensive Olympics in history. London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion. Cost per athlete was $1.4 million.<ref>{{Cite book|ssrn=2804554|title=The Oxford Olympics Study 2016: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Games|last1=Flyvbjerg|first1=Bent|last2=Stewart|first2=Allison|last3=Budzier|first3=Alexander|publisher=Saïd Business School, University of Oxford|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often cost as much or more than the sports-related costs.

The costs of mounting the Games were separate from those for building the venues and infrastructure, and redeveloping the land for the Olympic Park. While the Games were privately funded, the venues and Park costs were met largely by public money.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the original budget for the Games was increased to about £9.3 billion (US$15.28 billion) in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pearman|first=Hugh|title=These Knock-Down, Shrinkable Games|url=http://professional.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303754904577532921054250902.html?mod=ITP_personaljournal_3&mg=reno64-wsj|accessdate=25 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=25 July 2012|page=D6}}</ref> The revised figures were announced to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 15 March 2007 by [[Tessa Jowell]]. Along with East End regeneration costs, the breakdown was:
* Building the venues and infrastructure&nbsp;— £5.3&nbsp;billion.
* Elite sport and Paralympic funding&nbsp;— £400&nbsp;million.
* Security and policing&nbsp;— £600&nbsp;million.
* Regeneration of the Lower Lea Valley&nbsp;— £1.7&nbsp;billion.
* Contingency fund&nbsp;— £2.7&nbsp;billion.

===Environmental policy===
The [[Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park|Olympic Park]] was planned to incorporate 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, with a total of 525 bird boxes, and 150 bat boxes. Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/news/archive/2009-02/new-biodiversity-plan-sets-out-future-for-olympic-park-wildlife.php|title=New biodiversity plan sets out future for Olympic Park wildlife|work=London 2012|accessdate=5 March 2009|date=27 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309051828/http://www.london2012.com/news/archive/2009-02/new-biodiversity-plan-sets-out-future-for-olympic-park-wildlife.php|archivedate=9 March 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Renewable energy also features at the Olympics.

Food packaging at the Olympics is made from compostable materials&nbsp;– like starch and cellulose-based [[bioplastics]]&nbsp;– where it cannot be re-used or recycled. This includes fast food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons. After they have been used, many of these materials would be suitable for [[anaerobic digestion]] (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/news/compostable-bioplastics-set-for-big-win-at-london-olympics|title=Compostable bioplastics set for big win at London Olympics|work=NNFCC|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=31 May 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606000417/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/news/compostable-bioplastics-set-for-big-win-at-london-olympics|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Buildings like the [[Water Polo Arena]] will be relocated elsewhere. Building Parts like Roofing Covers and membranes of different temporary venues will be recycled via [[Vinyloop]]. This allowed organisers to meet the standards of the [[Olympic Delivery Authority]] concerning environmental protection. Through this recycling process, the Olympic Games PVC Policy is fulfilled. It says that

:Where London 2012 procures PVC for temporary usage or where permanent usage is not assured, London 2012 is required to ensure that there is a take-back scheme that offers a closed loop reuse system or mechanical recycling system for [[post-consumer waste]].

"The majority of temporary facilities created for the Olympic Games including the [[London Aquatics Centre|Aquatic centre]] temporary stands, basketball arena, [[Water Polo Arena]], and the shooting facilities at the [[Royal Artillery Barracks]], are essentially big tents. Basically PVC stretched over lightweight steel frame. This design solution makes them efficient to install, reduces the need for any significant foundations and are, of course, reusable. We were challenged by the public around the use of PVC; but we considered it to be the right material for certain functions. We therefore challenged the PVC supply chain to have certain environmental performance criteria in place, including a take back and recycle scheme" says Kirsten Henson, Materials Manager for the London 2012 Olympic Park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plasticseurope.org/information-centre/televised-newslinks.aspx |title=Televised Newslinks |publisher=PlasticsEurope |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=25 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308122835/http://www.plasticseurope.org/information-centre/televised-newslinks.aspx |archivedate=8 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

London's bid featured the same 28 sports that had been included in other recent Summer Olympics, but the IOC voted to drop [[baseball]] and [[softball]] from the 2012 Games just two days after London had been selected as the host city.

[[File:International Broadcast Centre, 14 June 2011 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The [[London Olympics Media Centre|International Broadcast Centre]] in June 2011]]

The host broadcaster was [[Olympic Broadcasting Services]] (OBS), an agency of the IOC. The OBS used its own cameras, and crews subcontracted from other Olympic broadcasters, to cover the events. The base video and audio were sold to other broadcasters, who added their own [[Sports commentary|commentary]] and presentation.

The official recording format of the 2012 Summer Olympics used [[Panasonic]]'s digital technologies. The official video was produced and distributed from the [[London Olympics Media Centre|International Broadcast Centre]] in 1080/50i High-Definition (HD) format. Panasonic announced that DVCPRO HD would be the official recording format. OBS London used [[P2 (storage media)|P2]] HD shoulder-mount camcorders.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Panasonic Announces 3D P2 HD Shoulder-Mount Camcorder ... for London 2012 Olympic Games|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110410005065/en/Panasonic-Announces-3D-P2-HD-Shoulder-Mount-Camcorder|publisher=Panasonic|accessdate=25 May 2011|date=10 April 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414131953/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110410005065/en/Panasonic-Announces-3D-P2-HD-Shoulder-Mount-Camcorder|archivedate=14 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The IOC's wanted television coverage to reach as broad a worldwide audience as possible, and London 2012 was covered by several national and regional broadcasters. In the UK, the [[BBC]] carried the Olympics and [[Channel 4]] the Paralympics. The BBC aimed to broadcast all 5,000 hours of the Games.<ref name="Roger Mosey Blog">{{cite web|date=29 September 2010|title=Roger Mosey's Blog|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/rogermosey/2010/06/highlighting_an_issue.html|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 September 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703005322/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/rogermosey/2010/06/highlighting_an_issue.html|archivedate=3 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[BBC Parliament]]'s [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] channel was suspended, [[BBC Three]]'s on-air time was extended so that it could show Olympic events in the daytime, and 24 additional BBC Olympics channels were available via cable, satellite and the internet in the UK.

In [[Sri Lanka]] a dispute occurred between [[Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation|Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC)]] and [[MTV Channel|MBC Networks (MTV/MBC)]] as to who was the official broadcaster of the Games. This problem was caused as [[Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union|Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU)]] had offered the official broadcasting rights to both networks, as both of the networks were ABU members.

===Logo and graphics===
There have been two London 2012 logos: one created by Kino Design for the bidding process and a second as the brand for the Games themselves. The former was a ribbon with blue, yellow, black, green and red stripes winding through the text "LONDON 2012", making the shape of the River Thames in East London. The latter, designed by [[Wolff Olins]], was published on 4 June 2007. It is a representation of the number 2012, with the [[Olympic symbols|Olympic Rings]] embedded within the zero.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/about-newlook-video.html|title=The new London 2012 brand|publisher=London 2012|date=4 June 2007|accessdate=4 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606204757/http://www.london2012.com/about-newlook-video.html|archivedate=6 June 2007}}</ref>

The official London 2012 Olympic typeface was called Headline 2012 and also suffered some criticism. Journalist Simon Garfield made it number 1 in the list of the "8 Worst Fonts in the World" in his 2010 book ''[[Just My Type]]'', commenting that "the uncool font is based on jaggedness and crudeness", although he conceded that it was "a brilliant piece of corporate branding".<ref>{{cite news|title=The 8 Worst Fonts In The World|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665318/the-8-worst-fonts-in-the-world|work=Co.Design|year=2010|accessdate=6 August 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808073805/http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665318/the-8-worst-fonts-in-the-world|archivedate=8 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=London 2012: 20 lesser-spotted things of the Olympics so far|date=6 August 2012|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19047586|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 August 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811095531/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19047586|archivedate=11 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The magazine ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' pointed out that the typeface was intended for "awareness, impact and memorability as a headline typeface" rather than elegance or readability in long sections of text.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rhatigan|first1=Dan|last2=Haley|first2=Allan|title=Olympic typography through the years|date=3 August 2012|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-08/03/olympic-typography|work=Wired|location=San Francisco|accessdate=13 August 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817050735/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-08/03/olympic-typography|archivedate=17 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Controversies==
{{main|Controversies at the 2012 Summer Olympics}}
During the lead-up to the Games, there were controversies over sponsorship,<ref>{{cite news|last=Carman|first=Tim|date=18 July 2012|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/mcdonalds-olympian-achievement-in-london-a-french-fry-monopoly-and-largest-fast-food-restaurant/2012/07/18/gJQAZ6tQuW_story.html|title=McDonald's Olympian achievement in London: A French fry monopoly and largest fast-food restaurant|work=The Washington Post|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719175857/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/mcdonalds-olympian-achievement-in-london-a-french-fry-monopoly-and-largest-fast-food-restaurant/2012/07/18/gJQAZ6tQuW_story.html|archivedate=19 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the athletes' use of social media, and several political issues. After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed throughout the games, even at some of the most popular events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.<ref name="washingtonpost1"/>
