'''José Paciano Laurel y García''' {{post-nominals|list=[[Philippine Legion of Honor|CCLH]]}} (March 9, 1891 – November 6, 1959) was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] politician and judge. He was the president of the [[Second Philippine Republic]], a Japanese [[puppet state]] when occupied during World War II, from 1943 to 1945. Since the administration of President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] (1961–1965), Laurel has been officially recognized by later administrations as a former president of the Philippines.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Jose Laurel.JPG|thumb|left|Laurel in 1922, when he was an attorney.]]

José Paciano Laurel y García was born on March 9, 1891 in the town of [[Tanauan, Batangas]]. His parents were [[Sotero Laurel I]] and [[Jacoba García]]. His father had been an official in the revolutionary government of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] and a signatory to the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1899 Malolos Constitution]].

While a teen, Laurel was indicted for attempted murder when he almost killed a rival suitor of the girl he stole a kiss from with a [[Butterfly knife|fan knife]]. While studying and finishing [[law school]], he argued for and received an acquittal.<ref>[http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1912/mar1912/gr_l-7037_1912.html G.R. No. L-7037, March 15, 1912]</ref>

Laurel received his law degree from the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]] in 1915, where he studied under Dean [[George A. Malcolm]], whom he would later succeed on the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]]. He then obtained a [[Master of Laws]] degree from [[University of Santo Tomas]] in 1919. Laurel then attended [[Yale Law School]], where he obtained his [[J.S.D.]] degree.

Laurel began his life in public service while a student, as a messenger in the Bureau of Forestry then as a clerk in the Code Committee tasked with the [[Codification (law)|codification]] of Philippine laws. During his work for the Code Committee, he was introduced to its head, [[Thomas A. Street]], a future [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Justice]] who would be a mentor to the young Laurel.<ref>American Colonial Careerist, p. 104</ref>

Upon his return from [[Yale University|Yale]], Laurel was appointed first as Undersecretary of the Interior Department, then promoted as [[Department of the Interior and Local Government|Secretary of the Interior]] in 1922. In that post, he would frequently clash with the American [[Governor-General]] [[Leonard Wood]], and eventually, in 1923, resign from his position together with other Cabinet members in protest of Wood's administration. His clashes with Wood solidified Laurel's nationalist credentials.

Laurel was a member of the Philippine fraternity [[Upsilon Sigma Phi]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXsMAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Jos%C3%A9+P.+Laurel%22+upsilon|title=The Fookien Times Philippines Yearbook|last=Company|first=Fookien Times Publishing|date=1986|publisher=Fookien Times|isbn=9789710503506|location=|page=226|language=en}}</ref>

==Senator and Congressman of the Philippines==
In 1925 Laurel was elected to the [[Philippine Senate]]. He would serve for one term before losing his re-election bid in 1931 to [[Claro M. Recto]].<ref name="Supreme Court p. 175">Justices of the Supreme Court, p. 175</ref> He retired to private practice, but by 1934, he was again elected to public office, this time as a delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention. Hailed as one of the "Seven Wise Men of the Convention", he would sponsor the provisions on the Bill of Rights.<ref name="Supreme Court p. 175"/> Following the ratification of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]] and the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]], Laurel was appointed [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] on February 29, 1936.

==Associate Justice of the Supreme Court==
Laurel's Supreme Court tenure may have been overshadowed by his presidency, yet he remains one of the most important Supreme Court justices in Philippine history. He authored several leading cases still analyzed to this day that defined the parameters of the branches of government as well as their powers.

[http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1936/jul1936/gr_l-45081_1936.html ''Angara v. Electoral Commission''], [[Case citation#The Philippines|63 Phil. 139 (1936)]], which is considered as the Philippine equivalent of ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', [[case citation|5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803)]], is Laurel's most important contribution to jurisprudence and even the rule of law in the Philippines. In affirming that the Court had [[jurisdiction]] to review the rulings of the Electoral Commission organized under the [[Congress of the Philippines|National Assembly]], the Court, through Justice Laurel's [[opinion]], firmly entrenched the power of Philippine courts to engage in [[judicial review]] of the acts of the other branches of government, and to interpret the Constitution. Held the Court, through Laurel:
<blockquote>The Constitution is a definition of the powers of government. Who is to determine the nature, scope and extent of such powers? The Constitution itself has provided for the instrumentality of the judiciary as the rational way. And when the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1936/jul1936/gr_l-45081_1936.html|title=G.R. No. L-45081|website=lawphil.net|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Another highly influential decision penned by Laurel was [http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1940/feb1940/gr_l-46496_1940.html ''Ang Tibay v. CIR''], [[Case citation#The Philippines|69 Phil. 635 (1940)]]. The Court acknowledged in that case that the substantive and procedural requirements before proceedings in administrative agencies, such as labor relations courts, were more flexible than those in judicial proceedings. At the same time, the Court still asserted that the right to [[due process of law]] must be observed, and enumerated the "cardinal primary rights" that must be respected in administrative proceedings. Since then, these "cardinal primary rights" have stood as the standard in testing due process claims in administrative cases.

''Calalang v. Williams'', [[Case citation#The Philippines|70 Phil. 726 (1940)]] was a seemingly innocuous case involving a challenge raised by a private citizen to a traffic regulation banning [[kalesa]]s from [[Manila]] streets during certain afternoon hours. The Court, through Laurel, upheld the regulation as within the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] of the government. But in rejecting the claim that the regulation was violative of [[social justice]], Laurel would respond with what would become his most famous [[aphorism]], which is to this day widely quoted by judges and memorized by Filipino law students:
<blockquote>Social justice is neither communism, nor despotism, nor atomism, nor anarchy, but the humanization of laws and the equalization of social and economic forces by the State so that justice in its rational and objectively secular conception may at least be approximated. Social justice means the promotion of the welfare of all the people, the adoption by the Government of measures calculated to insure economic stability of all the competent elements of society, through the maintenance of a proper economic and social equilibrium in the interrelations of the members of the community, constitutionally, through the adoption of measures legally justifiable, or extra-constitutionally, through the exercise of powers underlying the existence of all governments on the time-honored principle of [[salus populi est suprema lex]]. Social justice, therefore, must be founded on the recognition of the necessity of interdependence among divers and diverse units of a society and of the protection that should be equally and evenly extended to all groups as a combined force in our social and economic life, consistent with the fundamental and paramount objective of the state of promoting the health, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and of bringing about "the greatest good to the greatest number.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/cralaw/1940decemberdecisions.php?id=237|title=G.R.

The presidency of Laurel understandably remains one of the most controversial in Philippine history. After the war, he would be denounced by the pro-American sectors{{Who|date=November 2011}} as a [[collaborationism|war collaborator]] or even a traitor, although his indictment for treason was superseded by [[Manuel Roxas#Amnesty Proclamation|President Roxas' Amnesty Proclamation]].<ref name="GovPH-Proc51">{{cite web |title=Proclamation No. 51, s. 1948 {{!}} GOVPH |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1948/01/28/proclamation-no-51-s-1948/ |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |access-date=21 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321050055/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1948/01/28/proclamation-no-51-s-1948/ |archivedate=21 March 2019}}</ref> However, despite being one of the most infamous figures in Philippine history, he is also regarded as a Pan-Asianist who supported independence. When asked if he was pro-American or pro-Japanese, his answer would be pro-Filipino.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

===Accession===
[[File:A propaganda slogan during the Laurel administration.jpg|thumb|One of the many propaganda slogans made during the Laurel administration. Tagalog for "One Banner, One Nation, One Language".]]

When Japan invaded, President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] first fled to [[Bataan]] and then to the United States to establish a government-in-exile.  Quezon ordered Laurel, Vargas and other cabinet members to stay. Laurel's prewar, close relationship with Japanese officials (a son had been sent to study at the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in Tokyo, and Laurel had received an honorary doctorate from Tokyo University), placed him in a good position to interact with the Japanese occupation forces.

Laurel was among the Commonwealth officials instructed by the Japanese Imperial Army to form a provisional government when they invaded and occupied the country. He cooperated with the Japanese, in contrast to Chief Justice [[José Abad Santos|Abad Santos]], who was shot for refusing to cooperate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/about/gov/judiciary/sc/cj/jose-abad-santos/the-execution-of-jose-abad-santos/ |title=The execution of Jose Abad Santos &#124; Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |publisher=Officialgazette.gov.ph |date=2014-01-21 |access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref> Because he was well known to the Japanese as a critic of US rule, as well as having demonstrated a willingness to serve under the Japanese Military Administration, he held a series of high posts in 1942–1943. Under vigorous Japanese influence, the National Assembly selected Laurel to serve as president in 1943.

===Domestic policies===

====Economy====
During Laurel's tenure as president, [[hunger]] was the main worry. Prices of essential commodities rose to unprecedented heights. The government exerted every effort to increase production and bring [[consumer]]s' [[good (economics)|goods]] under control. However, Japanese rapacity had the better of it all. On the other hand, [[guerrilla]] activities and Japanese retaliatory measures brought the peace and order situation to a difficult point. Resorting to district-zoning and domiciliary searches, coupled with arbitrary arrests, the Japanese made the mission of Laurel's administration incalculably exasperating and perilous.<ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961">Molina, Antonio. ''The Philippines: Through the centuries''. Manila: University of Sto. Tomas Cooperative, 1961. Prin</ref>

====Food shortage====
During his presidency, the Philippines faced a crippling food shortage which demanded much of Laurel's attention.<ref name="By Sword and By Fire, p. 137">By Sword and By Fire, p. 137</ref> Rice and bread were still available but the sugar supply was gone.<ref name="Manila, My Manila">{{cite book|author=Joaquin, Nick|title=Manila, My Manila|publisher=Vera-Reyes, Inc.|year=1990|isbn=|pages=|url=}}</ref> Laurel also resisted Japanese demands that the Philippines issue a formal declaration of war against the United States. He later was forced to declare war on the US and Great Britain as long as Filipinos would not have to fight.

===Foreign policies===

====Philippine-Japanese Treaty of Alliance====
On October 20, 1943 the Philippine-Japanese Treaty of Alliance was signed by [[Claro M. Recto]], who was appointed by Laurel as his Foreign Minister, and Japanese Ambassador to Philippines Sozyo Murata. One redeeming feature was that no conscription was envisioned.<ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/>

====Greater East Asia Conference====
[[File:Greater East Asia Conference.JPG|thumb|Greater East Asia Conference]]

Shortly after the inauguration of the Second Philippine Republic, President Laurel, together with cabinet Ministers Recto and Paredes flew to Tokyo to attend the [[Greater East Asia Conference]] which was an international summit held in Tokyo, Japan from November 5 – 6, 1943, in which Japan hosted the [[head of state|heads of state]] of various component members of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. The conference was also referred to as the ''Tokyo Conference''.

The Conference addressed few issues of any substance, Eradication of Western Opium Drug Trade and to illustrate the [[Empire of Japan]]'s commitments to the [[Pan-Asianism]] ideal and to emphasize its role as the "liberator" of Asia from Western [[colonialism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Andrew|title=The Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times to the Present|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|page=211|isbn=0-19-511060-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FiEMgP36lScC&q=%22Greater+East+Asia+Conference%22&pg=PA211|access-date=April 13, 2008}}</ref>

====Martial law====
Laurel declared the country under martial law in 1944 through Proclamation No. 29, dated September 21.<ref name="Lawphil-Proc29">{{cite web |title=Proclamation No. 29 |url=https://www.lawphil.net/executive/proc/procXXX/proc_29_1944.html |website=The Lawphil Project - Philippine Laws and Jurisprudence Databank |access-date=21 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926145922/http://www.lawphil.net/executive/proc/procXXX/proc_29_1944.html |archivedate={{date|26 Sep 2017}}}}</ref> Martial law came into effect on September 22, 1944 at 9&nbsp;am.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Proclamation No. 30 was issued the next day, declaring the existence of a state of war between the Philippines and the United States and the United Kingdom.

==== Filipinization of the Catholic Church ====
On the day of his inauguration, Laurel sought to gain recognition for the new republic from the [[Holy See]]. Correspondence between the diplomats of the Vatican and Japan told that the Holy See did not wish to recognize any new states for the duration of the War. Despite this, Laurel still sought to appeal to the Pope about instating Filipinos into the Church hierarchy.<ref>''Le président des Iles Philippines Laurel au pape Pie XII''. Rome, 11 March 1944. (A.E.S. 1927/44). '''Acts and Documents of the Holy See Relative to the Second World War Vol. 11''' pp. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/actes/documents/Volume-7.pdf#page=232 232-234]</ref>
{{Quote|text=As the Head of the Republic of Philippines,' I take liberty of voicing to Your Holiness the desire and sentiments of eighteen million Filipinos, the majority of whom are ardent Catholics, with respect to the matter which vitally affects the administration of the Catholic Church in Philippines, and which may have far reaching effects on their religious faith. I refer to Filipinization of the Catholic hierarchy and clergy in Philippines.

Your Holiness will remember that the movement for Filipinization of the clergy furnished one of the prime motivations of our revolution against Spain; that with overthrow of Spanish sovereignty only 250 out of 17,000 Spanish friars assigned to Philippines in 1898 were retained; that pursuant to the policy announced by the Holy See, Spanish bishops were replaced by American Catholic bishops; that during the American regime more missionaries of different nationalities came to the country; and that at present we have five Bishops and two Apostolic Prefects of foreign nationalities, while in certain provinces, such as Surigao, Agusan, Antique, Misamis Oriental, Mindoro, Bukidnon, Davao, Cotabato, Palawan and Mountain Province, parishes are still under the charge of foreign friars and missionaries. Now that the independence of Philippines has been finally achieved, the Republic of Philippines, though it fundamentally recognizes the separation of Church and State, can no longer remain indifferent to a long-felt need to Filipinize the local Catholic hierarchy and clergy.

In advocating this reform, the Filipino people are not moved by any spirit of animosity or hostility against any race or nationality, but they are inspired solely by the desire to win a just recognition for the Filipino race in their own country and to secure a vindication of capacity of Filipinos to manage their own affairs, temporal or spiritual. The projected measure can be achieved without in the least prejudicing interests, or sacrificing the creed or doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. Without in any way presuming to invade an ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Philippines, it is my honest belief that the spread of Catholicism among our non-Christian brethren and consequently increase of its followers in this country. This, in my opinion, is in consonance with the desire of His Holiness Pope Pius XI when he said:

«From the fact that the Roman Pontiff has entrusted to you and to your helpers a task of preaching Christian religion to pagan nations, you ought not to conclude that the role of native clergy is solely that of assisting missionaries in minor matters and in some sort of completing their work».

What is the object of these holy missions, we ask, except that the Church of Christ may be instituted and established in those boundless regions? And from what shall the Church be built up today among heathens, except from those elements out of which it was built up among us that is unless it is composed of people, clergy and religious men and women recruited from their own country? Why should native clergy be prevented from cultivating their country which is their own native soil that is, from governing their own people? In propagation of Faith, a Filipino priest, by reason of his birth and temper, his sentiments and interests, is in far better position to carry on his mission than a stranger. As a matter of fact, he would know better than any foreigner the best method of approach to his own people and thus he would often have access where an alien priest could never gain an entrance. Moreover foreign missionaries, on account of their imperfect knowledge of Filipino language, are frequently prevented from expressing themselves fully and having themselves clearly understood, as a result of which, force and efficacy of their teachings are greatly weakened. It will also be a source of genuine satisfaction and lasting inspiration for Filipino people to see a Filipino at the head of the Catholic Church in Philippines, a Filipino priest in every parish and a Filipino missionary in every remote corner of the country. Certainly, it will foster development of national clergy of superior stamp and it will serve as an ideal incentive for Filipino clergy to work to the highest degree of perfection
and the same time to encourage vocations to religious and sacerdotal life.

In view of foregoing considerations, I beg to convey and reiterate the desire and request of my people that it is, as it has always been, their cherished hope that after more than four centuries of Catholicism in Philippines, Your Holiness will see the wisdom of principle invoked and grant their petition for complete Filipinization of Catholic hierarchy and clergy in their own country.|author=Jose P.

====Assassination attempt====
On June 5, 1943, Laurel was playing golf at the [[Wack Wack Golf and Country Club]] in [[Mandaluyong City|Mandaluyong]] when he was shot around four times with a [[.45 ACP|.45 caliber pistol]].<ref name=ocampo1>{{cite book |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |author-link=Ambeth Ocampo |title=Bonifacio's Bolo |origyear=1995 |edition=4th |year=2000 |publisher=Anvil Publishing |location=Pasig City |isbn=971-27-0418-1 |page=60 |chapter=The Irony of Tragedy }}</ref> The bullets barely missed his heart and liver.<ref name=ocampo1/> He was rushed by his golfing companions, among them [[Far Eastern University|FEU]] president [[Nicanor Reyes Sr.]], to the [[Philippine General Hospital]] where he was operated by the Chief Military Surgeon of the Japanese Military Administration and Filipino surgeons.<ref name=ocampo1/> Laurel enjoyed a speedy recovery.

On July 26, 1945, the [[Potsdam Declaration]] served upon Japan an ultimatum to surrender or face utter annihilation. The Japanese government refused the offer. On August 6, 1945, [[Hiroshima]], with some 300,000 inhabitants, was almost totally destroyed by an [[atomic bomb]] dropped from an American plane. Two days later, the Soviet Union declared war against Japan and invaded Manchuria.<ref>Molina, Antonio. ''The Philippines: Through the centuries''. Manila: University of Santo Tomas Cooperative, 1961. Print.</ref> The next day, August 9, 1945, a second atomic bomb was dropped on [[Nagasaki]]. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]]' message now had a telling effect: Japan unconditionally surrendered to the Allied Powers on August 15, 1945.<ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/>

Since April 1945, President Laurel, together with his family and Cabinet member [[Camilo Osías]], Speaker [[Benigno Aquino Sr.]], Gen. Tomas Capinpin, and Ambassador [[Jorge B. Vargas]], had been in Japan. Evacuated from [[Baguio]] shortly after the city fell, they traveled to [[Aparri]] and thence, on board Japanese planes, had been taken to Japan. Laurel was put in [[Sugamo Prison]] then was later transferred to Nara for house arrest. On August 17, 1945, from Nara Hotel in [[Nara, Nara|Nara, Japan]], President Laurel issued an Executive Proclamation which declared the dissolution of his regime.<ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/>

President Laurel is the only Philippine president who served the three branches of government. He became a senator-congressman, associate justice and a president of the second republic.

==Post-presidency==

===1949 presidential election===
On September 2, 1945, the Japanese forces formally [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered]] to the United States. [[Douglas MacArthur|Gen. Douglas MacArthur]] ordered Laurel arrested for collaborating with the Japanese. In 1946 he was charged with 132 counts of [[treason]], but he was never brought to trial due to the general [[Manuel Roxas#Amnesty Proclamation|amnesty]] granted by President [[Manuel Roxas]] in 1948.<ref name="GovPH-Proc51" /> Laurel ran for president against [[Elpidio Quirino]] in [[1949 Philippine general election|1949]] but lost in what future Secretary of Foreign Affairs [[Carlos P. Romulo]] and Marvin M. Gray considered as the dirtiest election in Philippine electoral history.<ref name="quirino-phil-arch">{{cite web|url=http://philippines-archipelago.com/people/presidents/elpidio_quirino.html|title=Elpidio Quirino|access-date=2009-08-09}}</ref>

===Return to the senate===
[[File:Sen Primicias in Malacanang.jpg|thumb|[[Malacañan Palace|At Malacañan Palace]], 1955. ''Clockwise, from top left:'' Senator Edmundo Cea, Former President José P. Laurel Sr., Senator Primicias, Senate President [[Eulogio Rodriguez|Eulogio A. Rodriguez Sr.]], President [[Ramon Magsaysay|Ramon F. Magsaysay]], & House Speaker José B. Laurel Jr.]]

Laurel garnered the biggest votes and was elected to the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] in [[1951 Philippine general election|1951]], under the [[Nacionalista Party (Philippines)|Nacionalista Party]]. He was urged to run for president in 1953, but declined, working instead for the successful election of [[Ramon Magsaysay]]. Magsaysay appointed Laurel head of a mission tasked with negotiating trade and other issues with United States officials, the result being known as the [[Laurel–Langley Agreement]].

===Retirement and death===
Laurel considered his election to the Senate as a vindication of his reputation. He declined to run for re-election in 1957. He retired from public life, concentrating on the development of the [[Lyceum of the Philippines]] established by his family.

During his retirement, Laurel stayed in a 1957 3-story, 7-bedroom mansion in [[Mandaluyong City]], dubbed "Villa Pacencia" after Laurel's wife. The home was one of three residences constructed by the Laurel family, the other two being in [[Tanauan, Batangas]] and in [[Paco, Manila]] (called "Villa Peñafrancia"). In 2008, the Laurel family sold "Villa Pacencia" to [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Ex-Senate President]] [[Manny Villar]] and his wife [[Cynthia Villar|Cynthia]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Villars take over storied Laurel house on Shaw Blvd |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080713-148119/Villars-take-over-storied-Laurel-house-on-Shaw-Blvd |first=Gerry |last=Lirio |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=July 13, 2008 |access-date=March 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209000941/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080713-148119/Villars-take-over-storied-Laurel-house-on-Shaw-Blvd |archivedate=February 9, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On November 6, 1959, Laurel died at the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in [[Santa Mesa]], [[Manila]],<ref>Justices of the Supreme Court, p. 176</ref> from a massive heart attack and a stroke. He is buried in Tanauan, Batangas.
