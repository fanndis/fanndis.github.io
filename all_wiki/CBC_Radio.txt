'''CBC Radio''' is the English-language [[radio]] operations of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]. The CBC operates a number of radio networks serving different audiences and programming niches, all of which (regardless of language) are outlined below.

==English==
CBC Radio operates three [[English language]] networks.

*[[CBC Radio One]] - Primarily news and information, Radio One broadcasts to most communities across Canada. Until 1997, it was known as "CBC Radio".
*[[CBC Music]] - Broadcasts an adult music format with a variety of genres, with the classical genre generally restricted to midday hours. From 2007 to 2018, it was known as "CBC Radio 2". 
*[[CBC Radio 3]] - Broadcasts a youth-oriented [[indie rock]] format on [[Internet radio]] and [[Sirius XM Radio]]. Some content from Radio 3 was also broadcast as weekend programming on Radio Two until March 2007.
The inconsistency of branding between the word "One" and the numerals "2" and "3" was a deliberate design choice on CBC's part and is not an error, though from 1997 to 2007, CBC Music was known as "CBC Radio Two".

From 1944 to 1962 CBC's English service operated two radio networks, the main [[Trans-Canada Network]] and the [[Dominion Network]]. In 1962 the Dominion Network was disbanded and the Trans-Canada Network became known as CBC Radio and in 1997, CBC Radio One. In some cases CBC announcers will still say "CBC Radio" in reference to programs that air only on Radio One.

CBC Music originated in 1960 as the CBC FM network. It was rebranded as CBC Stereo in 1975, and then CBC Radio Two in 1997 before becoming CBC Music in 2018.

In August 2009, CBC Radio launched a [[mobile app]], initially for [[iOS]], featuring streams of the three services, and other web-exclusive stations. In February 2012, CBC launched a new, similar streaming platform and app known as CBC Music.<ref name=citizen>[https://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/launches+free+digital+music+service/6145770/story.html "CBC launches free digital music service"].

The CBC (better known in French as ''la Société Radio-Canada'', or colloquially simply ''Radio-Canada'') also operates two [[French language]] radio networks, each of which has a similar programming focus to one of the corporation's English-language radio networks. A third service was discontinued in 2013.

Structurally, the French-language radio operations are managed as part of the CBC's overall French-language services division, and therefore have limited ties to the English-language radio networks, which are structured similarly (i.e., there is no overall "CBC Radio" division responsible for both English and French radio).

*[[Ici Radio-Canada Première]] - News and information.
*[[Ici Musique]] - Music, arts and culture.
*[[Bande à part (radio)|Bande à part]] - Youth-oriented programming on Internet and Sirius, although some content continues to air as weekend programming on Espace musique, the predecessor of Ici Musique. Discontinued in 2013.

==CBC North==
In the [[Northwest Territories]], [[Yukon]], [[Nunavut]], and [[Nord-du-Québec|northern Quebec]], [[CBC North]] airs a modified Radio One schedule to accommodate programming in Native languages and Radio Nord Quebec, which airs a combined Radio One / Première schedule via shortwave mixed in with programming in native languages. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Other services==
The CBC operates [[Radio Canada International]] (RCI), an online service.  RCI ended its [[shortwave radio]] broadcast in June 2012.

In some remote Canadian tourist areas, such as national or provincial parks, the CBC also operates a series of transmitters which broadcast weather alerts from [[Environment Canada]]'s [[Weatheradio Canada]] service. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The CBC formerly operated ''Galaxie'', a [[digital television radio]] service which provides 45 channels of music programming to [[digital cable]] subscribers in both English and French. This service is now operated by [[Stingray Digital]], who since relaunched the service as ''[[Stingray Music]]''. CBC also celebrates the generation of leaders, builders and change-makers of Canada under the age of 40 through the CBC Future 40 People Choice Award.

==CBC Radio in the news==
In 2012, CBC Radio lost some of its funding as a result of large cuts in Canadian government spending. This has resulted in a reduction of the number of concerts being recorded, the closing of recording studios and the laying off of technicians,<ref name=wm2012>"Industry News: CBC budget cuts mean fewer live recordings", Words and Music, Fall 2012</ref> as well as the introduction of four minutes per hour of [[advertising]] on Radio 2 and Espace musique.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2013/05/28/crtc_cbc_radio_2_espace_musique_allowed_to_air_advertising.html "CRTC allows advertising on CBC Radio 2 and Espace Musique"].
