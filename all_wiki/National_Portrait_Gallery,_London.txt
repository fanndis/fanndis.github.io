The '''National Portrait Gallery''' ('''NPG''') is an [[art gallery]] in London housing a collection of portraits of historically important and famous [[British people]]. It was the first portrait gallery in the world when it opened in 1856.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=National Portrait Gallery: About | publisher=ARTINFO | year=2008 | url=http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/18664/5243/about/national-portrait-gallery-london/ | accessdate=30 July 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204010257/http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/18664/5243/about/national-portrait-gallery-london/ | archivedate=4 December 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The gallery moved in 1896 to its current site at St Martin's Place, off [[Trafalgar Square]], and adjoining the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]]. It has been expanded twice since then. The National Portrait Gallery also has regional outposts at [[Beningbrough Hall]] in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Montacute House]] in [[Somerset]]. It is unconnected to the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] in Edinburgh, with which its remit overlaps. The gallery is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]].

==Collection==
[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Chandos portrait]] of [[William Shakespeare]], the first painting to enter the NPG's collection]]

The gallery houses [[portrait]]s of historically important and famous [[British people]], selected on the basis of the significance of the sitter, not that of the artist. The collection includes photographs and [[caricature]]s as well as paintings, drawings and sculpture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/artslife/story.html?id=f76fcf3a-8f3e-46bf-bb1d-ebce6be3446e&k=48373&p=1 |title=Every great country must have its portrait gallery |publisher=Canada.com |date=12 October 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825122623/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/artslife/story.html?id=f76fcf3a-8f3e-46bf-bb1d-ebce6be3446e&k=48373&p=1 |archivedate=25 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> One of its best-known images is the [[Chandos portrait]], the most famous portrait of [[William Shakespeare]]<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080911031935/http://www.npg.org.uk/live/woshakespeare.asp National Portrait Gallery | What's on? | Searching for Shakespeare]</ref> although there is some uncertainty about whether the painting actually is of the playwright.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/mar/02/arts.books/print |work=The Guardian  | location=London | title=The only true painting of Shakespeare – probably | first=Charlotte | last=Higgins | date=2 March 2006 | accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref>

Not all of the portraits are exceptional artistically, although there are self-portraits by [[William Hogarth]], Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] and other [[British artists]] of note. Some, such as the group portrait of the participants in the [[Somerset House]] Conference of 1604, are important historical documents in their own right. Often, the curiosity value is greater than the artistic worth of a work, as in the case of the [[anamorphic projection|anamorphic]] portrait of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] by [[William Scrots]], [[Branwell Brontë|Patrick Branwell Brontë]]'s painting of his sisters [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte]], [[Emily Brontë|Emily]] and [[Anne Brontë|Anne]], or a sculpture of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] in medieval costume. Portraits of living figures were allowed from 1969. In addition to its permanent galleries of historical portraits, the National Portrait Gallery exhibits a rapidly changing selection of contemporary work, stages exhibitions of portrait art by individual artists and hosts the annual [[BP Portrait Prize]] competition.

The three people largely responsible for the founding of the National Portrait Gallery are commemorated with busts over the main entrance. At centre is [[Philip Henry Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope]], with his supporters on either side, [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay]] (to Stanhope's left) and [[Thomas Carlyle]] (to Stanhope's right). It was Stanhope who, in 1846 as a Member of Parliament (MP), first proposed the idea of a National Portrait Gallery. It was not until his third attempt, in 1856, this time from the House of Lords, that the proposal was accepted. With Queen Victoria's approval, the House of Commons set aside a sum of £2000 to establish the gallery. As well as Stanhope and Macaulay, the founder Trustees included [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere|Lord Ellesmere]]. It was the latter who donated the [[Chandos portrait]] to the nation as the gallery's first portrait. Carlyle became a trustee after the death of Ellesmere in 1857.<ref name="NPG history">[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/history.asp History of the National Portrait Gallery], accessed 26 May 2008.</ref>

[[File:2008 inside the National Portrait Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the National Portrait Gallery, 2008]]

For the first 40 years, the gallery was housed in various locations in London. The first 13 years were spent at 29 Great George Street, [[City of Westminster|Westminster]]. There, the collection increased in size from 57 to 208 items, and the number of visitors from 5,300 to 34,500. In 1869, the collection moved to [[Exhibition Road]] and buildings managed by the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]. Following a fire in those buildings, the collection was moved in 1885, this time to the [[Bethnal Green Museum]]. This location was ultimately unsuitable due to its distance from the [[West End of London|West End]], condensation and lack of waterproofing. Following calls for a new location to be found, the government accepted an offer of funds from the philanthropist William Henry Alexander. Alexander donated £60,000 followed by another £20,000, and also chose the architect, [[Ewan Christian]]. The government provided the new site, St Martin's Place, adjacent to the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], and £16,000.<ref name="NPG history"/> The buildings, faced in [[Portland stone]], were constructed by Shillitoe & Son.<ref>Hulme, Graham pg 105</ref> Both the architect, Ewan Christian, and the gallery's first director, [[George Scharf]], died shortly before the new building was completed. The gallery opened at its new location on 4 April 1896.<ref name="NPG history"/> The site has since been expanded twice. The first extension, in 1933, was funded by [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Lord Duveen]], and resulted in the wing by architect Sir [[Richard Allison (architect)|Richard Allison]]<ref>[http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/AboutUs/Community+Programmes/Heritage/rcjheritage.htm Royal Courts of Justice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721160006/http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/AboutUs/Community+Programmes/Heritage/rcjheritage.htm |date=21 July 2009 }}</ref> on a site previously occupied by [[St George's Barracks, London|St George's Barracks]] running along Orange Street.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2NDiDM3tcvIC&q=duveen+wing+opens+1933&pg=PA207|title=Stewards of the Nation's Art: Contested Cultural Authority, 1890–1939|first=Andrea Geddes |last=Poole|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8020-9960-0|page=207}}</ref>

In February 1909, a murder–suicide took place in a gallery known as the ''Arctic Room''. In an apparently planned attack, John Tempest Dawson, aged 70, shot his 58 year–old wife, Nannie Caskie; Dawson shot her from behind with a revolver, then shot himself in the mouth, dying instantly. His wife died in hospital several hours later. Both were American nationals who had lived in [[Hove]] for around 10 years.<ref>{{cite news | title=Murder And Suicide In The National Portrait Gallery | work=The Times | date=25 February 1909 | page=12 | issue=38892}}</ref> Evidence at the inquest suggested that Dawson, a wealthy and well–travelled man, was suffering from a [[persecutory delusion]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Inquests. The Shooting Affair At The National Portrait Gallery.  | work=The Times | date=1 March 1909 | page=3 | issue=38895}}</ref> The incident came to public attention in 2010 when the Gallery's archive was put on-line as this included a personal account of the event by [[James Milner (art historian)|James Donald Milner]], then the Assistant Director of the Gallery.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/7147540/Gruesome-murder-suicide-revealed-in-National-Portrait-Gallery-archive.html | title=Gruesome murder-suicide revealed in National Portrait Gallery archive | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=3 February 2010 | accessdate=21 May 2013 | author=Adams, Stephen}}</ref>

The collections of the National Portrait Gallery were stored at [[Mentmore Towers]] in Buckinghamshire during the [[Second World War]], along with pieces from the [[Royal Collection]] and paintings from Speaker's House in the Palace of Westminster.<ref name="Martin-Robinson2014">{{harvnb|Martin-Robinson|2014|pp=128}}</ref>

===Early 21st century===
The second extension was funded by Sir [[Christopher Ondaatje]] and a £12m [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] grant, and was designed by London-based architects [[Edward Jones (English architect)|Edward Jones]] and Jeremy Dixon.<ref>{{cite news|author=Fiachra Gibbons, Arts correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/may/05/fiachragibbons?INTCMP=SRCH |title=The Queen shares a joke with Lady Thatcher|work=The Guardian  |date= 5 May 2000|accessdate=10 December 2011 |location=London}}</ref> The Ondaatje Wing opened in 2000 and occupies a narrow space of land between the two 19th-century buildings of the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery, and is notable for its immense, two-storey escalator that takes visitors to the earliest part of the collection, the [[Tudor period|Tudor]] portraits.

In January 2008, the Gallery received its largest single donation to date, a £5m gift from U.S. billionaire [[Randy Lerner]].

In January 2012, [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]] announced the National Portrait Gallery as one of her official patronages.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-16411358 |title=Duchess of Cambridge announces charity patronages |date=5 January 2012 |work=BBC News}}</ref> [[Portrait of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Her portrait]] was unveiled in January 2013. The gallery holds nearly 20 portraits of [[Harriet Martineau]] and her brother [[James Martineau]], whose great-nephew [[Lupton family|Francis Martineau Lupton]] was the Duchess's great-great-grandfather.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Furness|first1=Hannah|title=Duchess of Cambridge visits National Portrait Gallery, home of little-known Middleton family paintings|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/10631996/Duchess-of-Cambridge-visits-National-Portrait-Gallery-home-of-little-known-Middleton-family-paintings.html|publisher=UK Daily Telegraph – pages 1 and 3|date =11 February 2014 |accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref>

[[Bodelwyddan Castle]]'s partnership with the National Portrait Gallery came to an end in 2017 after its funding was cut by [[Denbighshire County Council]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/15022017-funding-cut-forces-bodelwyddan-castle-to-end-loan-agreement-with-the-national-portrait-gallery?dm_i=2VBX,EVVJ,27LY3L,1IWTJ,1|first=Eleanor|last=Mills|date=15 March 2017|title=Bodelwyddan Castle to sever ties with National Portrait Gallery|publisher=[[Museums Association]]|accessdate=16 March 2017}}</ref>

In June 2017 it was announced that the NPG has been awarded funding of £9.4&nbsp;million from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] towards its major transformation programme ''Inspiring People'', the Gallery's biggest ever development.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unprecedented expansion for the National Portrait Gallery|url=https://www.hlf.org.uk/about-us/news-features/unprecedented-expansion-national-portrait-gallery|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref> The Gallery had already raised over £7m of its £35.5m target. The building works are scheduled to start in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inspiring People: Transforming our National Portrait Gallery|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/news2/inspiring-people|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=National Portrait Gallery Corporate Plan 2016–19|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/assets/files/pdf/corporate/busplan20162019.pdf|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref>

In October 2019, a group of semi-naked environmental campaigners were drenched in fake oil, in the Ondaatje Wing main hall, as part of a protest against BP's sponsorship of a collection of pieces in the gallery. The protest performance piece, which was entitled Crude Truth, involve a clothed protester reciting a monologue in which they called upon arts organisations to sever ties with companies “funding extinction”. Three activists covered in black liquid lay down for about five minutes on a plastic sheet before standing up again, wiping themselves down with towels, and cleaning up after themselves. The action, which was applauded by onlookers, passed uninterrupted.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/20/semi-naked-activists-protest-national-portrait-gallery-bp-sponsorship-fake-oil-extinction-rebellion|title=Semi-naked activists protest against National Portrait Gallery's links with BP|last=Busby|first=Mattha|date=2019-10-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

===Closure and refurbishment in 2020–2023===
A major programme of refurbishment with the project name of "Inspiring People" will lead to the gallery's closure from 2020 to 2023.  Some galleries will close by late May 2020, with full closure by July 2020.  There are a number of planned exhibitions and collaborations around the UK to display parts of the collection while the gallery is closed.  These will include exhibitions starting at the [[York Art Gallery]] in 2021, the [[Holburne Museum]], Bath (Tudor portraits, 2022), and museums in Liverpool, Newcastle, Coventry and Edinburgh, which will later tour to other venues.  Other partners include the [[National Trust]], the [[National Maritime Museum]] and the [[National Gallery]]. In London, the shops and restaurants will close, but the Heinz Archive and Library will remain open. Another programme, called "Coming Home", loans portraits of individual people to museums in their home towns.  Exhibitions will also travel to Japan, Australia and the United States.<ref name="Inspiring People">"Inspiring People"</ref>

The "Inspiring People" project "comprises a comprehensive redisplay of the Collection from the Tudors to now, combined with a complete refurbishment of the building, the creation of new public spaces, a more welcoming visitor entrance and public forecourt, and a new state of the art Learning Centre". The East Wing will return to being gallery space, with its own new street entrance.<ref name="Inspiring People"/>

==Exterior busts==
In addition to the busts of the three founders of the gallery over the entrance, the exterior of two of the original 1896 buildings are decorated with stone block busts of eminent portrait artists, biographical writers and historians. These busts, sculpted by [[Frederick R. Thomas]], depict [[James Granger]], [[William Faithorne]], [[Edmund Lodge]], [[Thomas Fuller]], [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|The Earl of Clarendon]], [[Horace Walpole]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Sir Anthony van Dyck]], [[Sir Peter Lely]], [[Sir Godfrey Kneller]], [[Louis François Roubiliac]], [[William Hogarth]], [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]] and [[Sir Francis Chantrey]].<ref name="NPG history"/>

==Finances and staff==
The National Portrait Gallery is an [[executive non-departmental public body]] of the UK Government, sponsored by the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Portrait Gallery |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-portrait-gallery |website=UK Government |accessdate=5 September 2018}}</ref>

The National Portrait Gallery's total income in 2007–2008 amounted to £16,610,000, the majority of which came from government [[grant-in-aid]] (£7,038,000) and donations (£4,117,000).<ref name=annual0708>{{cite book|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/assets/files/pdf/accounts/npgaccounts2007-8.pdf|title=National Portrait Gallery Annual Report and Accounts 2007–2008|publisher=[[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]]|isbn=978-0-10-295746-4|accessdate=14 July 2009}}</ref> As of 31 March 2008, its [[net assets]] amounted to £69,251,000.<ref name=annual0708/> In 2008, the NPG had 218 [[full-time equivalent]] employees.<ref name=annual0708/> It is an [[exempt charity]] under English law.<ref>Charities Act 1993, Schedule 2.</ref>

{{Main|National Portrait Gallery and Wikimedia Foundation copyright dispute}}
On 14 July 2009, the National Portrait Gallery sent a demand letter alleging breach of copyright against an editor-user of Wikipedia, who downloaded thousands of high-resolution reproductions of [[public domain]] paintings from the NPG website, and placed them on Wikipedia's sister media repository site, [[Wikimedia Commons]].<ref name="BBC-NPG legal threat-2009-07-15">
