The '''1972 United States presidential election in Texas''' was held on November 7, 1972, as part of the [[1972 United States presidential election]]. Incumbent Republican President [[Richard Nixon]] overwhelmingly won the state of Texas with 66.20% of the vote,<ref name="Atlas">{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?f=0&fips=48&year=1972|title=1972 Presidential General Election Results – Texas|accessdate=April 13, 2016}}</ref> to the Democratic Party candidate [[George McGovern]]’s 33.24%, thus giving him the state’s 26 electoral votes. This was the first time a Republican won the state of Texas since [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] won it in [[1956 United States presidential election in Texas|1956]].

Nixon’s win in Texas made him the first ever Republican presidential candidate to break sixty percent of Texas’ popular vote in a presidential election, surpassing former President Dwight D. Eisenhower's performance of 55.26% in 1956, and even native son [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]’s 63.32% in [[1964 United States presidential election in Texas|1964]]. Nixon is so far the only Republican candidate to break 65% of the state’s popular vote. At the county level, 246 of Texas’ 254 counties voted for Nixon, all by wide margins except heavily [[African Americans|black]] [[Robertson County, Texas|Robertson County]] where Nixon won by a single vote. Nixon won 22 of Texas’ 24 congressional districts – with the [[Texas's 18th congressional district|18th]] ([[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]]) and [[Texas's 20th congressional district|20th]] ([[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar County]]) constituting the only congressional districts McGovern won anywhere in the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. McGovern, however, did not win either county each of these districts were located in.

McGovern's only county wins came from the south Texas region along the [[Mexico–United States border|U.S.-Mexico border]] and [[Cottle County, Texas|Cottle County]] in the northern part of the state, though even his performances here were underwhelming. In fact, in the oldest extant Democrat stronghold in the entire United States,<ref name="How">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’]; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref> Nixon became the solitary Republican since [[Theodore Roosevelt]] carried the county in [[1904 United States presidential election in Texas|1904]] to win [[La Salle County, Texas|La Salle County]], the only Republican since [[Herbert Hoover]] in [[1928 United States presidential election in Texas|1928]] to carry [[Hidalgo County, Texas|Hidalgo County]],{{efn|Nixon‘s Hidalgo County win is the only time post-[[1928 United States presidential election in Texas|1928]] when a Republican has won ''any'' of the contiguous counties of Hidalgo, [[Starr County, Texas|Starr]], [[Brooks County, Texas|Brooks]], [[Zapata County, Texas|Zapata]], [[Jim Hogg County, Texas|Jim Hogg]], [[Duval County, Texas|Duval]], [[Webb County, Texas|Webb]] or [[Maverick County, Texas|Maverick]].}} the only Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower in [[1952 United States presidential election in Texas|1952]] to win [[Dimmit County, Texas|Dimmit County]], one of only two Republicans since the county was founded in 1911 (following Eisenhower in 1956) to carry [[Jim Wells County, Texas|Jim Wells County]] and the only Republican apart from Eisenhower's two victories there to win [[Willacy County, Texas|Wilacy County]] since it was created in 1921. This is also the last election at which [[Zavala County, Texas|Zavala County]] has voted Republican,<ref name="How"/> though that county did so even in 1960. [[Duval County, Texas|Duval County]], however, gave McGovern over 85 percent of the vote, which was the highest percentage of votes he received in any county nationally.<ref>Dave Leip’s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections; [http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/stats.php?year=1972&f=0&off=0&elect=0 1972 Presidential Election Statistics]</ref> 1972 was the third successive election when Duval proved the most Democratic county in the nation. Taking the region of South Texas to include all the above-mentioned counties (La Salle, Hidalgo, Dimmit, Jim Wells, Wilacy, Zavala, & Duval) as well as Maverick, Frio, Webb, Zapata, Jim Hogg, Starr, Brooks, Cameron, Kenedy, Kleberg, Nueces, and San Patricio, Nixon is to date the only Republican or non-Democrat to win a majority of said counties since Texas achieved statehood in 1848.

Nixon had previously narrowly lost Texas to [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[1960 United States presidential election in Texas|1960]] and had lost it to [[Hubert Humphrey]] in [[1968 United States presidential election in Texas|1968]].

As with the rest of the country that year, with the exception of [[1972 United States presidential election in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] and [[1972 United States presidential election in the District of Columbia|Washington, D.C.]], Texas voted for the Republican candidate as Nixon emphasized on a good economy and his successes in foreign affairs, such as coming near to ending American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] and establishing relations with China. McGovern was constantly portrayed throughout the campaign as being a left-wing extremist because of his support for [[busing]] and civil rights, plus his [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]], support for granting amnesty to [[draft evasion|draft dodgers]]<ref>Perry, James Moorhead; ''Us and Them: How the Press Covered the 1972 Election'', p. 136 {{ISBN|0517505525}}</ref> and support for a thousand-dollar giveaway to each American as a solution to poverty.<ref>Grantham, Dewey W.; ''The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History'', p. 179 {{ISBN|0813148723}}</ref> McGovern was also viewed as inconsistent following the replacement of his first running mate, [[Thomas Eagleton]], while many Republican campaigners believed McGovern would legalise abortion and illicit drugs if he were elected<ref>Davis, Lanny; ''Scandal: How "Gotcha" Politics Is Destroying America'', pp. 65-66 {{ISBN|1466892803}}</ref> – despite the fact that his ultimate running mate Sargent Shriver was firmly pro-life. As of the [[2020 United States presidential election in Texas|2020 presidential election]], this is the best Republican election performance in Texas, as well as the last time every single county in the [[Texas Triangle]] was won by the Republican candidate.

==Role of the Clintons in the McGovern campaign==
[[Bill Clinton]] and his then-girlfriend (and future wife) [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]] (both [[Yale Law School]] students at the time) moved to Austin to work on the Texas McGovern campaign.<ref name=clintons1>{{cite web |url=https://www.texastribune.org/2015/05/16/clintons-take-texas-1972/ |title=Allies Remember a Driven Hillary Rodham During 1972 Texas Campaign |last=Livingston |first=Abby |date=May 16, 2015 |website=www.texastribune.org |publisher=Texas Tribune |access-date=January 3, 2018 |quote=}}</ref>

Bill had originally planned to begin working as a southern states coordinator for the McGovern campaign during the summer of 1971. However, he postponed those plans in order to spend that summer with Hillary, who had taken a summer job in [[California]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.nysun.com/national/clintons-berkeley-summer-of-love/66982 | title=The Clintons' Berkeley Summer of Love | author=Gerstein, Josh | work=The New York Sun | date=November 26, 2007 | accessdate=May 9, 2009}}</ref> The following summer, Bill took a job working for the campaign in Texas. He asked Hillary if she would be interested in joining him there. In her memoir [[Living History (book)|Living History]], Hillary recalled, {{quote|Bill asked if I wanted to go too. I did, but only if I had a specific job.<ref name=clintons1/>}}

[[File:McGovern Texas button1.jpg|thumb|right|Hillary's workload of registering voters was large due to the 1972 presidential election being the first since the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18]]
Hillary was tasked with registering black and Hispanic voters in South Texas on behalf of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. With the 1972 election being the first in which 18 year-olds were able to vote, the task of voter registration was much greater than in other years.<ref name=clintons1/>
