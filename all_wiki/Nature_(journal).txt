'''''Nature''''' is a British weekly [[scientific journal]] founded and based in [[London|London, England]]. As a multidisciplinary publication, ''Nature'' features [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] research from a variety of academic disciplines, mainly in science, technology, and the [[Natural science|natural sciences]]. It has core editorial offices across the United States, continental Europe, and Asia under the international scientific publishing company [[Springer Nature]]. ''Nature'' was one of the world's most cited scientific journals by the Science Edition of the 2019 ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'' (with an ascribed [[impact factor]] of 42.778),<ref name="WoS">{{cite book|title=2019 Journal Citation Reports|title-link=Journal Citation Reports|publisher=[[Clarivate Analytics]]|year=2020|edition=Science|series=[[Web of Science]]|chapter=Nature}}</ref> making it one of the world's most-read and most prestigious [[academic journals]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huxley |first1=T.

Founded in Autumn 1869, ''Nature'' was first circulated by [[Norman Lockyer]] and [[Alexander Macmillan (publisher)|Alexander Macmillan]] as a public forum for scientific innovations. The mid-20th century facilitated an editorial expansion for the journal; ''Nature'' redoubled its efforts in explanatory and [[scientific journalism]]. The late-1980s and early-1990s created a network of editorial offices outside of Britain and established ten new supplementary, specialty publications (e.g. ''[[Nature Materials]]''). Since the late 2000s, the weekly created dedicated editorial and current affairs columns, as well as [[Political endorsement|electoral endorsements]]. The primary source of the journal remain, as established at its founding, research scientists; editing standards are primarily concerned with [[Jargon|technical readability]]. Each issue also features articles that are of general interest to the scientific community, namely business, funding, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books, arts, and short science fiction stories. 

The main research published in ''Nature'' consists mostly of papers (articles or letters) in lightly-edited form. As such they are highly technical and dense, but due to imposed text limits they are typically summaries of larger work. Innovations or breakthroughs in any scientific or technological field is [[Nature (journal)#Publication in Nature|featured in the journal]] as either letters or news articles. The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards. Conversely, due to journal's exposure, it has, at various times, been the [[Nature (journal)#Controversies|subject of controversy]] for its handling of academic dishonesty, the [[scientific method]], and news coverage. Fewer than 8% of submitted papers are accepted for publication.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/get_published/index.html |title=Getting published in Nature: For authors and referees |website= Nature |language=en |access-date=2017-06-18}}</ref> In 2007 ''Nature'' (together with ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'') received the [[Princess of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for Communications and Humanity.<ref name="SciNat">

==History==

===Background===
The enormous progress in science and mathematics during the 19th century was recorded in journals written mostly in German or French, as well as in English. Britain underwent enormous technological and industrial changes and advances particularly in the latter half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schroeder |first1=Robert |last2=Siegel |first2=Gretta E |s2cid=143466709 |title=A Cooperative Publishing Model for Sustainable Scholarship |journal=Journal of Scholarly Publishing |date=2006 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=86–98 |doi=10.1353/scp.2006.0006 |url=https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/ulib_fac/66 }}</ref> In English the most respected scientific journals of this time were the refereed journals of the [[Royal Society]], which had published many of the great works from [[Isaac Newton]], [[Michael Faraday]] through to early works from [[Charles Darwin]]. In addition, during this period, the number of popular science periodicals doubled from the 1850s to the 1860s.<ref name="Bar3">{{harvnb|Barton|1996|p=3}}</ref> According to the editors of these popular science magazines, the publications were designed to serve as "organs of science", in essence, a means of connecting the public to the scientific world.<ref name="Bar3"/>

''Nature'', first created in 1869, was not the first magazine of its kind in Britain. One journal to precede ''Nature'' was ''Recreative Science: A Record and Remembrancer of Intellectual Observation'', which, created in 1859, began as a [[natural history]] magazine and progressed to include more physical observational science and technical subjects and less natural history.<ref name="Bar7">{{harvnb|Barton|1996|p=7}}</ref> The journal's name changed from its original title to ''Intellectual Observer: A Review of Natural History, Microscopic Research, and Recreative Science'' and then later to the ''Student and Intellectual Observer of Science, Literature, and Art''.<ref name="Bar6">{{harvnb|Barton|1996|p=6}}</ref> While ''Recreative Science'' had attempted to include more physical sciences such as [[astronomy]] and [[archaeology]], the ''Intellectual Observer'' broadened itself further to include literature and art as well.<ref name="Bar6"/> Similar to ''Recreative Science'' was the scientific journal ''Popular Science Review'', created in 1862,<ref name="Bar13">{{harvnb|Barton|1996|p=13}}</ref> which covered different fields of science by creating subsections titled "Scientific Summary" or "Quarterly Retrospect", with book reviews and commentary on the latest scientific works and publications.<ref name="Bar13"/> Two other journals produced in England prior to the development of ''Nature'' were the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' and ''[[Scientific Opinion]]'', established in 1864 and 1868, respectively.<ref name="Bar6"/> The journal most closely related to ''Nature'' in its editorship and format was ''[[The Reader (weekly)|The Reader]]'', created in 1863; the publication mixed science with literature and art in an attempt to reach an audience outside of the scientific community, similar to ''Popular Science Review''.<ref name="Bar6"/>

These similar journals all ultimately failed. The ''Popular Science Review'' survived longest, lasting 20 years and ending its publication in 1881; ''Recreative Science'' ceased publication as the ''Student and Intellectual Observer'' in 1871. The ''Quarterly Journal'', after undergoing a number of editorial changes, ceased publication in 1885. ''The Reader'' terminated in 1867, and finally, ''Scientific Opinion'' lasted a mere 2 years, until June 1870.<ref name="Bar7"/>

===Creation ===
[[File:Nature cover, November 4, 1869.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First title page, 4 November 1869]]
Not long after the conclusion of ''The Reader'', a former editor, [[Norman Lockyer]], decided to create a new scientific journal titled ''Nature'',<ref name="B248">{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=248}}</ref> taking its name from a line by [[William Wordsworth]]: "To the solid ground of nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye".<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww698.html Poem: "A Volant Tribe of Bards on earth are found"]. Bartleby.com. Retrieved on 20 June 2013.</ref> First owned and published by [[Alexander Macmillan (publisher)|Alexander Macmillan]], ''Nature'' was similar to its predecessors in its attempt to "provide cultivated readers with an accessible forum for reading about advances in scientific knowledge."<ref name="B248"/> Janet Browne has proposed that "far more than any other science journal of the period, ''Nature'' was conceived, born, and raised to serve polemic purpose."<ref name="B248"/> Many of the early editions of ''Nature'' consisted of articles written by members of a group that called itself the [[X Club]], a group of scientists known for having liberal, progressive, and somewhat controversial scientific beliefs relative to the time period.<ref name="B248"/> Initiated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the group consisted of such important scientists as [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[John Tyndall]], along with another five scientists and mathematicians; these scientists were all avid supporters of Darwin's theory of evolution as [[common descent]], a theory which, during the latter half of the 19th century, received a great deal of criticism among more conservative groups of scientists.<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=247}}</ref> Perhaps it was in part its scientific liberality that made ''Nature'' a longer-lasting success than its predecessors. [[John Maddox]], editor of ''Nature'' from 1966 to 1973 as well as from 1980 to 1995, suggested at a celebratory dinner for the journal's centennial edition that perhaps it was the journalistic qualities of Nature that drew readers in; "journalism" Maddox states, "is a way of creating a sense of community among people who would otherwise be isolated from each other. This is what Lockyer's journal did from the start."<ref name="Dinner">{{cite journal |last1=Maddox |first1=John |last2=Macmillan |first2=Harold |title=The 'Nature' Centenary Dinner |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |date=1970 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=9–15 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.1970.0002 |jstor=530861 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In addition, Maddox mentions that the financial backing of the journal in its first years by the Macmillan family also allowed the journal to flourish and develop more freely than scientific journals before it.<ref name="Dinner"/>
 
====Editors====
[[Norman Lockyer]], the founder of ''Nature'', was a professor at [[Imperial College]]. He was succeeded as editor in 1919 by [[Sir Richard Gregory, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Gregory]].<ref name="NPG">{{cite web |url=https://nature.com/npg_/company_info/timeline1.html#/nature/history/timeline_1860s.html |title=Nature Research: History |website=nature.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115084545/http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml%2F02_history.xml&style=xml%2F02_history.xsl#/nature/history/timeline_1860s.html |archive-date=15 November 2006 |access-date=6 December 2018 }}</ref> Gregory helped to establish ''Nature'' in the international scientific community. His obituary by the Royal Society stated: "Gregory was always very interested in the international contacts of science, and in the columns of ''Nature'' he always gave generous space to accounts of the activities of the International Scientific Unions."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Richard Arman Gregory, 1864-1952 |journal=Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society |date=January 1997 |volume=8 |issue=22 |pages=410–417 |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1953.0007 |doi-access=free }}</ref> During the years 1945 to 1973, editorship of ''Nature'' changed three times, first in 1945 to A. J. V. Gale and [[L. J. F. Brimble]] (who in 1958 became the sole editor), then to [[John Maddox]] in 1965, and finally to [[David 'Dai' Davies|David Davies]] in 1973.<ref name="NPG"/> In 1980, Maddox returned as editor and retained his position until 1995. [[Philip Campbell (scientist)|Philip Campbell]] became Editor-in-chief of all ''Nature'' publications until 2018. [[Magdalena Skipper]] has since become Editor-in-chief.<ref name="NPG"/>

====Expansion and development====
In 1970, ''Nature'' first opened its Washington office; other branches opened in New York in 1985, Tokyo and Munich in 1987, Paris in 1989, San Francisco in 2001, Boston in 2004, and Hong Kong in 2005. In 1971, under [[John Maddox]]'s editorship, the journal split into ''Nature Physical Sciences'' (published on Mondays), ''Nature New Biology'' (published on Wednesdays), and ''Nature'' (published on Fridays). In 1974, Maddox was no longer editor, and the journals were merged into ''Nature''.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Nature |url=https://www.nature.com/nature/about/history-of-nature |website=Nature }}</ref> Starting in the 1980s, the journal underwent a great deal of expansion, launching over ten new journals. These new journals comprise Nature Research, which was created in 1999 under the name Nature Publishing Group and includes ''Nature'', [[List of Nature Research journals|Nature Research Journals]], Stockton Press Specialist Journals and Macmillan Reference (renamed NPG Reference). In 1996, ''Nature'' created its own website<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/timeline2.html|title = Branching out (1970–1999)|access-date = 13 November 2014|website = nature.com|publisher = Nature Research |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629183906/http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/timeline2.html |archive-date=June 29, 2007 }}</ref> and in 1999 Nature Publishing Group began its series of ''Nature Reviews''.<ref name="NPG" /> Some articles and papers are available for free on the Nature website, while others require the purchase of premium access to the site. {{As of|2012}}, ''Nature'' claimed an online readership of about 3 million unique readers per month.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal |title=Announcement: A new iPad app for Nature readers |journal=Nature |date=12 December 2012 |volume=492 |issue=7428 |pages=154 |doi=10.1038/492154a |doi-access=free }}</ref>

On 30 October 2008, ''Nature'' endorsed an American presidential candidate for the first time when it supported [[Barack Obama]] during his campaign in [[2008 United States presidential election|America's 2008 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=America's choice |journal=Nature |date=29 October 2008 |volume=455 |issue=7217 |pages=1149 |doi=10.1038/4551149a |pmid=18971969 |bibcode=2008Natur.455Q1149. |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Angliss |url=http://www.scholarsandrogues.com/2008/10/31/nature-endorses-obama/ |title=Weekly science journal ''Nature'' endorses a presidential candidate: Barack Obama (updated) |website=Scholars & Rogues |date=31 October 2008 |access-date=2017-11-04}}</ref> In October 2012, an [[Nature Arabic Edition|Arabic edition]] of the magazine was launched in partnership with [[King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology]].

According to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', another academic journal, being published in ''Nature'' has been known to carry a certain level of prestige in academia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Callier |first1=Viviane |title=Yes, it is getting harder to publish in prestigious journals if you haven't already |journal=Science |date=10 December 2018 |doi=10.1126/science.caredit.aaw3380 }}</ref> In particular, empirical papers are often highly cited, which can lead to promotions, grant funding, and attention from the mainstream media. Because of these [[positive feedback]] effects, competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like ''Nature'' and its closest competitor, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', can be very fierce. ''Nature''{{'}}s [[impact factor]], a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works, was 38.138 in 2015 (as measured by [[Institute for Scientific Information|Thomson ISI]]).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Journal metrics {{!}} Nature Research|url=https://www.nature.com/nature-research/about/journal-metrics|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Nature|url=https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21206&tip=sid|website=www.scimagojr.com|access-date=2020-05-30}}</ref> However, as with many journals, most papers receive far fewer citations than the impact factor would indicate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Larivière|first=Vincent|last2=Kiermer|first2=Véronique|last3=MacCallum|first3=Catriona J.|last4=McNutt|first4=Marcia|last5=Patterson|first5=Mark|last6=Pulverer|first6=Bernd|last7=Swaminathan|first7=Sowmya|last8=Taylor|first8=Stuart|last9=Curry|first9=Stephen|date=2016-07-05|title=A simple proposal for the publication of journal citation distributions|url=http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/062109|language=en|doi=10.1101/062109}}</ref> ''Nature''<nowiki/>'s journal impact factor carries a long tail.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Callaway|first=Ewen|date=2016-07-14|title=Beat it, impact factor!

As with most other professional scientific journals, papers undergo an initial screening by the editor, followed by [[peer review]] (in which other scientists, chosen by the editor for expertise with the subject matter but who have no connection to the research under review, will read and critique articles), before publication. In the case of ''Nature'', they are only sent for review if it is decided that they deal with a topical subject and are sufficiently ground-breaking in that particular field. As a consequence, the majority of submitted papers are rejected without review.

According to ''Nature''{{'}}s original [[mission statement]]:
{{quote|It is intended, FIRST, to place before the general public the grand results of Scientific Work and Scientific Discovery; and to urge the claims of Science to a more general recognition in Education and in Daily Life; and, SECONDLY, to aid Scientific men themselves, by giving early information of all advances made in any branch of Natural knowledge throughout the world, and by affording them an opportunity of discussing the various Scientific questions which arise from time to time.<ref name=nature1869>{{cite web |url=http://media.nature.com/full/nature-cms/uploads/ckeditor/attachments/7568/mission.pdf |title=Nature's mission statement |access-date=13 June 2020 |work= nature.com|date=11 November 1869 }} Reprinted as: {{cite journal |title=A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Science (Reprinted from Nature, January 20, 1870) |journal=Nature |date=November 1969 |volume=224 |issue=5218 |pages=424 |doi=10.1038/224424a0 |bibcode=1969Natur.224..424W |author1=Wordsworth |s2cid=4255504 }}</ref>}}

This was later revised to:
{{quote|First, to serve scientists through prompt publication of significant advances in any branch of science, and to provide a forum for the reporting and discussion of news and issues concerning science.

===Controversies===
In 2017, Nature published an editorial entitled "Removing Statues of Historical figures risks whitewashing history: Science must acknowledge mistakes as it marks its past". The article commented on the placement and maintenance of statues honouring scientists with known unethical, abusive and torturous histories. Specifically, the editorial called on examples of [[J. Marion Sims]], the 'Father of gynecology' who experimented on African American female slaves who were unable to give informed consent, and [[Thomas Parran Jr.]] who oversaw the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].  The editorial as written made the case that removing such statues, and erasing names, runs the risk of "whitewashing history", and stated "Instead of removing painful reminders, perhaps these should be supplemented". The article caused a large outcry and was quickly modified by Nature.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Science must acknowledge its past mistakes and crimes |journal=Nature |date=7 September 2017 |volume=549 |issue=7670 |pages=5–6 |doi=10.1038/549005b |pmid=28880309 |bibcode=2017Natur.549R...5. |s2cid=4462464 }}</ref> The article was largely seen as offensive, inappropriate, and by many, racist. Nature acknowledged that the article as originally written was "offensive and poorly worded" and published selected letters of response.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Readers respond to Nature's Editorial on historical monuments |journal=Nature |date=8 September 2017 |doi=10.1038/nature.2017.22584 }}</ref> The editorial came just weeks after hundreds of white supremacists marched in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] in the [[Unite the Right Rally|Unite the Right rally]] to oppose the removal of [[Robert E. Lee Monument (Charlottesville, Virginia)|a statue of Robert E. Lee]], setting off violence in the streets and killing a young woman. When Nature posted a link to the editorial on [[Twitter]], the thread quickly exploded with criticisms. In response, several scientists called for a boycott.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Schulson |first=Michael |title=History Lessons for 'Nature'|date=17 September 2017 |newspaper=Undark Magazine |url=https://undark.org/article/nature-journal-j-marion-sims/}}</ref> On 18 September 2017, the editorial was updated and edited by Philip Campbell, the editor of the journal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=Philip |s2cid=47247939 |title=Statues: an editorial response |journal=Nature |date=18 September 2017 |volume=549 |issue=7672 |pages=334 |doi=10.1038/549334c |pmid=28922663 |bibcode=2017Natur.549..334C }}</ref>

When [[Paul Lauterbur]] and [[Peter Mansfield]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for research initially rejected by ''Nature'' and published only after Lauterbur appealed against the rejection, ''Nature'' acknowledged more of its own missteps in rejecting papers in an editorial titled, "Coping with Peer Rejection":
{{quote|[T]here are unarguable ''faux pas'' in our history. These include the rejection of [[Čherenkov radiation|Cherenkov radiation]], [[Hideki Yukawa]]'s [[meson]], work on [[photosynthesis]] by [[Johann Deisenhofer]], [[Robert Huber]] and [[Hartmut Michel]], and the initial rejection (but eventual acceptance) of [[Stephen Hawking]]'s [[Hawking radiation|black-hole radiation]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Nature |date=16 October 2003 |title=Coping with peer rejection |volume=425 |page=645 |doi=10.1038/425645a |pmid=14562060 |issue=6959 |bibcode=2003Natur.425..645.|doi-access=free }}</ref>}}

In June 1988, after nearly a year of guided scrutiny from its editors, ''Nature'' published a controversial and seemingly anomalous paper detailing [[Jacques Benveniste]] and his team's work studying human [[Basophil granulocyte|basophil]] [[degranulation]] in the presence of extremely dilute [[antibody]] serum.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Davenas |first1=E. |last2=Beauvais |first2=F. |last3=Amara |first3=J. |last4=Oberbaum |first4=M. |last5=Robinzon |first5=B. |last6=Miadonnai |first6=A. |last7=Tedeschi |first7=A. |last8=Pomeranz |first8=B. |last9=Fortner |first9=P. |last10=Belon |first10=P. |last11=Sainte-Laudy |first11=J. |last12=Poitevin |first12=B. |last13=Benveniste |first13=J. |s2cid=12992106 |title=Human basophil degranulation triggered by very dilute antiserum against IgE |journal=Nature |date=June 1988 |volume=333 |issue=6176 |pages=816–818 |doi=10.1038/333816a0 |pmid=2455231 |bibcode=1988Natur.333..816D }}</ref> The paper concluded that less than a single molecule of antibody could trigger an immune response in human basophils, defying the physical [[law of mass action]]. The paper excited substantial media attention in Paris, chiefly because their research sought funding from [[homeopathic]] medicine companies. Public inquiry prompted ''Nature'' to mandate an extensive and stringent experimental [[replication (statistics)|replication]] in Benveniste's lab, through which his team's results were refuted.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maddox |first1=John |last2=Randi |first2=James |last3=Stewart |first3=Walter W. |s2cid=9579433 |title='High-dilution' experiments a delusion |journal=Nature |date=1 July 1988 |volume=334 |issue=6180 |pages=287–290 |doi=10.1038/334287a0 |pmid=2455869 |bibcode=1988Natur.334..287M }}</ref>

Before publishing one of its most famous discoveries, [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]'s 1953 [[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid|paper]] on the [[structure of DNA]], ''Nature'' did not send the paper out for peer review. [[John Maddox]], ''Nature''{{'}}s editor, stated: "the Watson and Crick paper was not peer-reviewed by ''Nature'' ... the paper could not have been refereed: its correctness is self-evident. No referee working in the field ... could have kept his mouth shut once he saw the structure".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maddox |first1=J. |doi=10.1038/426119b |title=How genius can smooth the road to publication |journal=Nature |volume=426 |issue=6963 |page=119 |year=2003|bibcode=2003Natur.426..119M |doi-access=free }}</ref>

An earlier error occurred when [[Enrico Fermi]] submitted his breakthrough paper on the weak [[Fermi's interaction|interaction theory]] of [[beta decay]]. ''Nature'' rejected the paper because it was considered too remote from reality.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rhodes, Richard |title=The Making of the Atomic Bomb|publisher= Touchstone|location= New York|date= 1986|isbn= 978-0-671-44133-3}}</ref> Fermi's paper was published by ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' in 1934.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fermi |first1=E. |s2cid=125763380 |title=Versuch einer Theorie der β-Strahlen.

The journal apologised for its initial coverage of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] in which it linked China and Wuhan with the outbreak, which may have led to racist attacks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3079293/coronavirus-nature-magazine-apologises-reports-linking-covid-19|title=Scientific journal admits error in linking coronavirus with China|date=2020-04-09|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Stop the coronavirus stigma now |journal=Nature |date=7 April 2020 |volume=580 |issue=7802 |pages=165 |doi=10.1038/d41586-020-01009-0 |pmid=32265571 |bibcode=2020Natur.580..165. |doi-access=free }}</ref>

====Dubious peer-review process====
A paper was published with important figure anomalies from an author with a past of publishing figure anomalies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Figure “anomalies” prompt Harvard group to retract Nature paper |url=https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/18/harvard-group-retracts-nature-paper-2/ |author=retractionwatch}}</ref>

A 2013 fraudulent paper was also published in Nature.<ref>{{cite web |title=Authors have papers in Nature and Science retracted on the same day |url=https://retractionwatch.com/2019/04/11/authors-have-papers-in-nature-and-science-retracted-on-the-same-day/ |author=retractionwatch}}</ref>

From 2000 to 2001, a series of five fraudulent papers by [[Schön scandal|Jan Hendrik Schön]] was published in ''Nature''. The papers, about [[semiconductors]], were revealed to contain falsified data and other scientific fraud. In 2003, ''Nature'' retracted the papers. The Schön scandal was not limited to ''Nature''; other prominent journals, such as ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Physical Review]]'', also retracted papers by Schön.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Retractions' realities |journal=Nature |date=6 March 2003 |volume=422 |issue=6927 |pages=1 |doi=10.1038/422001a |pmid=12621394 |bibcode=2003Natur.422Q...1. |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Science fiction==
In 1999 ''Nature'' began publishing [[science fiction]] [[short stories]]. The brief "[[vignette (literature)|vignettes]]" are printed in a series called "Futures". The stories appeared in 1999 and 2000, again in 2005 and 2006, and have appeared weekly since July 2007.<ref name="futures">{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/arts/futures/ | title=Futures | work=Nature | access-date=9 August 2012}}</ref> Sister publication ''[[Nature Physics]]'' also printed stories in 2007 and 2008.<ref name="FuturesPhysics">{{cite web |url= http://www.nature.com/nphys/archive/categ_fut_012008.html |title=Futures Archive |work= [[Nature Physics]] |access-date= 1 May 2014 }}</ref> In 2005, ''Nature'' was awarded the [[European Science Fiction Society]]'s Best Publisher award for the "Futures" series.<ref name="ESFSAward">{{cite web |url= http://www.esfs.info/esfs-awards-2000.html#2005 |title= The ESFS Awards, Eurocon 2005: Glasgow – Scotland |author= European Science Fiction Society |date= 21 May 2013 |author-link= European Science Fiction Society }}</ref> One hundred of the ''Nature'' stories between 1999 and 2006 were published as the collection ''Futures from Nature'' in 2008.<ref name="FuturesCollection">{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/futuresfromnatur0000unse |title= Futures from Nature: 100 Speculative fictions from the pages of the leading science journal |editor= Henry Gee |publisher= [[Tor Books]] |date= 2008 |location= New York City |isbn= 978-0-7653-1805-3 |quote= With stories from: [[Arthur C.

==Publication ==
[[File:Nature Materials Nov 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Nature Materials]],'' a specialized journal from [[Nature Research]], 2018.]]

''Nature'' is edited and published in the United Kingdom by a division of the international [[scientific publishing]] company [[Springer Nature]] that publishes academic journals, [[magazine]]s, online databases, and services in science and medicine. ''Nature'' has offices in London, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., [[Boston]], Tokyo, Hong Kong, Paris, [[Munich]], and [[Basingstoke]]. Nature Research also publishes other specialized journals including ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]'', ''[[Nature Biotechnology]],'' ''[[Nature Methods]]'', the ''[[Nature Clinical Practice]]'' series of journals, ''[[Nature Structural & Molecular Biology]]'', ''[[Nature Chemistry]]'', and the ''Nature Reviews'' series of journals.{{fact|date=June 2020}}

Since 2005, each issue of ''Nature'' has been accompanied by a ''[[Nature Podcast]]''<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/archive.html | work = Nature |title = Archive: Nature Podcast |access-date = 1 May 2014 }}</ref> featuring highlights from the issue and interviews with the articles' authors and the journalists covering the research. It is presented by Kerri Smith, and features interviews with scientists on the latest research, as well as news reports from Nature's editors and journalists. The Nature Podcast was founded – and the first 100 episodes were produced and presented – by clinician and virologist [[Chris Smith, The Naked Scientist|Chris Smith]] of Cambridge and ''[[The Naked Scientists]]''.{{fact|date=June 2020}}

In 2007, Nature Publishing Group began publishing ''Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics'', the official journal of the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics and ''Molecular Therapy'', the American Society of Gene Therapy's official journal, as well as the ''International Society for Microbial Ecology (ISME) Journal''. Nature Publishing Group launched ''Nature Photonics'' in 2007 and ''Nature Geoscience'' in 2008. ''Nature Chemistry'' published its first issue in April 2009.{{fact|date=June 2020}}

Nature Research actively supports the self-archiving process and in 2002 was one of the first publishers to allow authors to post their contributions on their personal websites, by requesting an exclusive licence to publish, rather than requiring authors to transfer copyright. In December 2007, Nature Publishing Group introduced the Creative Commons attribution-non-commercial-share alike unported licence for those articles in Nature journals that are publishing the primary sequence of an organism's genome for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1864.html |title=Interview with Timo Hannay, director of web publishing for Nature Publishing Group |work=Jon Udell's Interviews with Innovators |date=5 July 2007}}</ref>

In 2008, a collection of articles from ''Nature'' was edited by John S. Partington under the title ''H. G. Wells in Nature, 1893–1946: A Reception Reader'' and published by Peter Lang.<ref>{{cite book|author=Partington, John S. |year=2008 |title=H. G.
