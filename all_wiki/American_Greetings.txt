Morris and Irving in 1928 got a post card contract worth $24,000. The company started using self-serve display cabinets for its greeting cards in 1929 further cementing its position in the market. Sapirstein Greeting began in 1932 making its own greeting cards.<ref name="idch">{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories, Vol.59 |date=2004 |publisher=St. James Press  | via=FundingUniverse |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/american-greetings-corporation-history/ |accessdate=July 25, 2019 |chapter=History of American Greetings Corporation}}</ref>

In 1934, the company began hiring sales representative. Harry, the youngest son, joined the business in 1935. In 1936, the company opened its first branch office and the first major manufacturing facility.<ref name="idch"/>

===American Greetings===
Sapirstein Greeting Card Co. was renamed in 1938 to American Greetings Publishers. In 1939, the firm first issued the Forget-Me-Not card line. Irving and his brothers changed their last name to Stone in the 1940s. American Greeting Publishers was incorporated in 1944. John Sands Pty. Ltd. of Sydney, Australia and the company signed a licensing agreement, the firm's first, in 1949.<ref name="idch"/>

The company changed its name to American Greetings Corporation as the company went public in 1952, issuing 200,000 shares. The funds raised were earmarked for acquisitions and expansion. In 1956, American Greetings formed Carlton Cards, Ltd., a Canadian subsidiary. Also that year, the Hi Brows humor studio card line was launched.<ref name="idch"/>

In July 1957, the company moved its headquarters to One American Road, Brooklyn, Ohio. In 1958, American Greetings went public.<ref name="cl"/> Jacob Sapirstein became chairman of the board while Irving assumed the company's president post in 1960.

In 1971, a retail subsidiary was formed called Summit Corporation, later called Carlton Cards Retail, Inc.<ref name="idch"/>

Sale the next year topped $100 million. In 1972, the company introduced Ziggy, created by [[Tom Wilson (cartoonist)|Tom Wilson]], which soon had a newspaper cartoon strip generating additional income. By 1977, Holly Hobbie became one of the top female licensed character in the world.<ref name="idch"/>

Morry Weiss, Irving's son-in-law, and Irving Stone in 1978 were appointed president and chairman & CEO, respectively. Also in 1978, the corporation set up two new subsidiaries Plus Mark, Inc. and A.G. Industries, Inc. Plus Mark was formed to manufacture Christmas gift wrap, boxed cards, and accessories. A.G. Industries was a display fixture manufacturer. American Greeting had seen itself as a mass-marketer and was serving pharmacies, variety stores, discount stores, and supermarkets with low cost cards. While, [[Hallmark Cards]] ignore the mass market outlets until 1959 with issuance of its Ambassador card line. The company then used its licensing revenue on national advertising and other efforts to gain market share from 1981 to 1985. While they had a net income increase of 613 percent over ten years, Hallmark still maintained its market share. [[Gibson Greetings]] started a price war in 1986 and ended in 1987 which had the three major greeting card companies taking a loss. With a drop in licensing revenue, American took until 1989 to recover.<ref name="idch"/>

The first property out of Those Characters was [[Strawberry Shortcake]], which generated in 1981 $500 million in retail sales, followed by the [[Care Bears]] with $2 billion in sales over its first two year.<ref name="idch"/>

AG came back with a doubled net income by 1991 with 10 percent growth in sales to Hallmark's 1 percent. Weiss was promoted to CEO while Ed Fruchtenbaum was elevated as the fourth and first non-family president. Weiss had streamline operations, cut cost and decreased its card idea development time frame to market. Fruchtenbaum stressed information systems technology with the development of software to aid the sales force, managers and their retailers to track inventories and trends. The following year, Weiss and Fruchtenbaum were promoted again to chairman/CEO and president/chief operating officer, respectively, with Irving Stone becoming founder-chairman.<ref name="idch"/>

Custom Expressions, Inc., the CreataCard producer, was acquired in 1992, The CreataCard units had 1,000 card options and printed cards in under four minutes for $3.50 each. The company placed a few thousand units in mass-merchandise outlets in the US. By early 1994, 7,000 were installed. The kiosks generated modest profits off healthy revenue. With the Touch Screen Greetings and the Personalize It! method, Hallmark in 1992 sued AG over patent infringement with a 1995 settlement that allow both to use the technology worldwide. By 1995, the kiosks were being left behind by personal computers and the internet. The units were partially written off. American had also made deal with online services, Prodigy, CompuServe, and Microsoft Network in early 1996.  Their website was redesigned to allow the cards to be designed on the website then mailed from its Cleveland fulfillment center in 1997. Two CD-ROM products, Personal CardShop for Home and Office and CreataCard Plus, were published both allowed for personalization. CardShop had 150 card choices and used the modem to order them to be printed and mailed by their fulfillment center. while CreataCard had 3,000 predesigned greeting cards, invitations, stationery, and announcements and three methods of fulfillment, print on home printer, by e-mail or via the company's center.<ref name="idch"/>

In the mid-1990s, American Greetings expanded it operations with acquisitions or starting up of new lines of business and starting in 1996, the promotion of sideline product categories to semi-autonomous units. A reading glasses manufacturer, Magnivision, in 1993 is purchased. Also in 1996, the party goods line is relaunched under the DesignWare name.

A candle line is relaunched in 1997 under the name GuildHouse. A supplemental educational products subsidiary, Learning Horizons, Inc., is set up in March 1997.
