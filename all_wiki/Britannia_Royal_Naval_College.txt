'''Britannia Royal Naval College (BRNC)''', commonly known as '''Dartmouth,''' is the [[naval academy]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and the initial officer training establishment of the Royal Navy. It is located on a hill overlooking the port of [[Dartmouth, Devon]], [[England]]. Royal Naval officer training has taken place in Dartmouth since 1863. The buildings of the current campus were completed in 1905. Earlier students lived in two wooden [[hulk (ship type)|hulk]]s moored in the [[River Dart]]. Since 1998, BRNC has been the sole centre for Royal Naval officer training.

==History==
The training of naval officers at Dartmouth dates from 1863, when the wooden hulk {{HMS|Britannia|1820|6}} was moved from [[Portland Harbour|Portland]] and moored in the [[River Dart]] to serve as a base.<ref name="YG39">{{harvnb|Walker|1938|p=39}}</ref> In 1864, after an influx of new recruits, ''Britannia'' was supplemented by {{HMS|Hindostan|1841|6}}.<ref name="YG40">{{harvnb|Walker|1938|p=40}}</ref>  Prior to this, a [[Royal Naval Academy]] (later Royal Naval College) had operated for more than a century from 1733 to 1837 at [[Portsmouth]], a major naval installation. The original ''Britannia'' was replaced by the {{HMS|Prince of Wales|1860|2}} in 1869, which was renamed ''Britannia.''<ref name="Lambert127">{{harvnb|Lambert|1984|pp= 122, 127–128}}</ref>

The foundation stone for a new building at the college was laid by [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] in March 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The King and Queen in Devon|day_of_week=Saturday |date=8 March 1902 |page_number=12 |issue=36710| }}</ref> Sir [[Aston Webb]] designed the shore-based college at Dartmouth, which was built by [[Higgs and Hill]]<ref>{{Cite book |title=Lambeth: Southern area |date=1956 |publisher=[[British History Online]] |series=Survey of London |volume=26 |pages=1–17 |chapter=General introduction |access-date=27 March 2010 |chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49753}}</ref> and practically completed in 1905.<ref name=Tweedmouth1906>{{cite journal|author=Lord Tweedmouth|authorlink=Edward Marjoribanks, 2nd Baron Tweedmouth|title=First Lord's Statement explanatory of Navy Estimates, 1906-7|date= 26 February 1906|journal=The Naval Annual| page= 370}}</ref>

The first term of cadets entered at the [[Osborne House|R.N. College Osborne]] were transferred to Dartmouth in September 1905.<ref name=Tweedmouth1906/> {{cquote|The ''Britannia'' training establishment was closed at the same time. The cadets under instruction were embarked on two cruisers to complete their programme under the old system.  The headquarters of the cruisers was established at [[Bermuda]], where suitable arrangements had been made to house the cadets.  The cadets entered in September under the old system, and those entered in January 1906 (the last to be so entered), were received at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, where they were instructed, as far as possible, side by side with the cadets transferred from Osborne.|20px|20px|[[Edward Marjoribanks, 2nd Baron Tweedmouth|Lord Tweedmouth]], First Lord of the Admiralty, 26 February 1906<ref name=Tweedmouth1906/>}}

The college was originally known as the '''Royal Naval College, Dartmouth''' (BRNC). As a Royal Naval shore establishment, it was later known also by the ship name '''HMS ''Britannia''''' (a battleship called {{HMS|Britannia|1904|2}} operated from 1904 to 1918). The college was re-named '''''HMS Dartmouth''''' in 1953, when the name ''Britannia'' was given to the newly launched royal yacht {{ship|HMY|Britannia}}. The training ship moored in the River Dart at Sandquay, a [[Sandown class minehunter|''Sandown'' class]] [[minehunter]] formerly known as {{HMS|Cromer|M103|6}}, continues to bear the name '''''Hindostan'''''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEW75zxn0Nw|title=Former HMS Cromer M103 now called 'Hindostan' at Sandquay, Britannia Royal Naval College|publisher=Classic Traction|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref> As cadets at the college will be aware, there are 187 steps down from the college to Hindostan's mooring at Sandquay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pprune.org/archive/index.php/t-117026.html |title=PPRuNe Archive |accessdate =2013-10-21}}</ref>

Cadets originally joined the [[Osborne House|Royal Naval College, Osborne]], at the age of 13 for two years' study and work before joining Dartmouth. The Royal Naval College, Osborne closed in 1921.<ref>{{cite book |first=Harry |last=Dickinson |title=Wisdom and War: the Royal Naval College Greenwich 1873–1998 |year=2016 |page=129 }}</ref>

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], after six [[Focke-Wulf]] aircraft bombed the College in September 1942, students and staff moved activities to [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]] in [[Cheshire]] until the autumn of 1946. Two bombs had penetrated the College's main block, causing damage to the quarterdeck and surrounding rooms.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Dartmouth |last=Harrold |first=Jane |last2=Porter |first2=Richard |date=2005 |publisher=Richard Webb |isbn=978-0-9536361-3-6}}</ref><ref>Article by Jane Harrold and Richard Porter in ''The Britannia Magazine 2004'', Crest Publications, pp. 6–7.</ref>

Britannia Royal Naval College became the sole naval college in the [[United Kingdom]] following the closures of the [[Royal Naval Engineering College]], Manadon, in 1994 and of the [[Royal Naval College (Greenwich)|Royal Naval College, Greenwich]], in 1998.<ref>Ian F. W. Beckett, ''Discovering British Regimental Traditions'' (Osprey Publishing, 2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SYWr-ljWbuQC&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 58]</ref>

In 2020, a group of [[Naval rating|Junior Rates]] were trained at BRNC to help alleviate added pressure on [[HMS Raleigh (1873)|HMS Raleigh]]. On 13 August 2020, a troop of 34 Ratings and 130 officers passed out simultaneously for the first time in the history of the Royal Navy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Navy officers and ratings make history at unique parade|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2020/august/13/200813-navy-officers-and-ratings-make-history-at-unique-parade|access-date=2020-08-13|website=www.royalnavy.mod.uk|language=en}}</ref>

==Entry==
Prospective cadets entrants must have at least 72 [[UCAS]] points. They then proceed to the [[Admiralty Interview Board]], where they are tested mentally and physically. Several mental [[aptitude]] tests are administered, along with a basic [[physical fitness]] test and a medical examination. Officer cadets, as they are known until passing out from the college, can join between the ages of 18 and 39.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Air Engineer Officer {{!}} Royal Navy Jobs in the Fleet Air Arm|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/careers/roles-and-specialisations/services/fleet-air-arm/air-engineer-officer|website=www.royalnavy.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-05-12}}</ref> While most cadets join BRNC after finishing university, some join directly from secondary school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.6253|title=Royal Navy Sponsorship|work=Royal Navy|accessdate=18 October 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015032216/http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.6253|archivedate=15 October 2008}}</ref> The commissioning course is 30 weeks, with Warfare Officers and Aircrew spending a further 19 weeks studying academics at the college.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Warfare Officer {{!}} Royal Navy Jobs in the Surface Fleet|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/careers/roles-and-specialisations/services/surface-fleet/warfare-officer|website=www.royalnavy.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-05-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Pilot {{!}} Royal Navy Jobs in the Fleet Air Arm|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/careers/roles-and-specialisations/services/fleet-air-arm/pilot|website=www.royalnavy.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-05-12}}</ref> A large contingent of international and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] students are part of the student body.
