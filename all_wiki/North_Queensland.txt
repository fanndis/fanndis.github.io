'''North Queensland''' or the '''Northern Region''' is the northern part of the Australian state of [[Queensland]] that lies just south of [[Far North Queensland]]. Queensland is a massive state, larger than many countries, and its [[Tropical North Queensland|tropical northern part]] has been historically remote and undeveloped, resulting in a distinctive regional character and identity.

[[Townsville]] is the largest urban centre in North Queensland, leading it to be regarded as an unofficial capital.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/SLQ:SLQ_PCI_EBSCO:slq_alma21117126250002061|title=The second capital of Queensland : Townsville futures plan|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=19 January 2017}}</ref> The region has a population of 231,628 and covers {{convert|80,041.5|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="absnrpn">{{cite web |url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@nrp.nsf/lookup/345Main+Features12006-2010 |title=National Regional Profile: Northern |date=1 November 2011 |work= |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=3 February 2012 }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Castle Hill Townsville.jpg|thumb|left|Suburbs of Townsville around [[Castle Hill, Queensland|Castle Hill]]]]
[[File:Proserpine-Sugar-Mill-1196.jpg|thumb|There a number of sugar mills in the region, including one at [[Proserpine, Queensland|Proserpine]]]]
There is no official boundary that separates North Queensland from the rest of the state. Unofficially it is usually considered to have a southern border beginning south of the [[Mackay Region]] southern boundary, but historically it has been as far south as [[Rockhampton]].  To the north is the [[Far North Queensland]] region,  centred on [[Cairns]] and out west is the [[Gulf Country]].

A coastal region  centred on its largest settlement is the city of Townsville. The city is the location of a major [[seaport]] handling exports from mines in [[Mount Isa]] and cattle exports from coastal and inland areas. The region also contains a bulk sugar exporting terminal at [[Lucinda, Queensland|Lucinda]] in the region's north. [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] and [[Shire of Burdekin|the Burdekin region]] are Australia's sugar capital and produces the most sugar in [[Australia]] and is shipped at Mackay Harbour. Mackay is also one of Australia's biggest coal exporters as it is close to Queensland's major mines. Dalrymple Bay, south of Mackay is another port where coal and sugar is exported.  It also contains the inland city of [[Charters Towers, Queensland|Charters Towers]] and the coastal towns of [[Ayr, Queensland|Ayr]] and [[Ingham, Queensland|Ingham]]. The [[Shire of Burdekin|Burdekin]] is centred on the two towns of [[Ayr, Queensland|Ayr]] and [[Home Hill, Queensland|Home Hill]] and while producing the largest amount of sugar, also produces seasonal fruit such as [[Lychee]]s and [[Mango]]s in Summer/wet season.

Other communities in North Queensland include [[Home Hill, Queensland|Home Hill]], [[Sarina, Queensland|Sarina]], [[Bowen, Queensland|Bowen]], [[Ayr, Queensland|Ayr]], and [[Proserpine, Queensland|Proserpine]].  [[Abbot Point]], north of Bowen, is a large, coal exporting port undergoing significant expansion.
