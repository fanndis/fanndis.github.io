==Quality of care==
In 2011, in the category of "Meeting National Standards of Care," California's state [[patient advocacy]] office gave Anthem a rating of 2 out of 4 stars.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://reportcard.opa.ca.gov/rc2012/medicalgroupabout.aspx | title=About the Medical Group Ratings | publisher=[[Government of California]]}}</ref> In 2014, it received 3 out of 4 stars in the same category.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-health-ratings-20140129-story.html | title=Report criticizes California health plans for treatment of chronic ailments | first=Chad | last=Terhune | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=January 28, 2014 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Giving for uninsured===
In 2007, WellPoint pledged to spend $30 million over three years, through the company's charitable foundation, to help the uninsured. In March 2010, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that WellPoint's tax records and website showed that the company gave only $6.2 million by 2009. The company disputed that, saying that the foundation did fulfill its $30-million commitment by mid-2009, but the company declined to provide any financial details to support its claim.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-mar-18-la-fi-wellpoint18-2010mar18-story.html | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | title=WellPoint's giving for uninsured falls short, records show | first=Noam | last=Levey | date=March 18, 2010 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

===Policy cancellations===
In 2007, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) investigated Anthem's policies for revoking (rescinding) health care insurance policies. The DMHC randomly selected 90 instances where Anthem canceled the insurance of policy holders who had been diagnosed with costly or life-threatening illnesses, to find how many of these cancellations were legal. The agency concluded that all these cancellations were illegal.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-insurers/insurer-targeted-hiv-patients-to-drop-coverage-idUSTRE62G2DO20100317 |title=Insurer targeted HIV patients to drop coverage | first=Murray | last=Waas | work=[[Reuters]] | date=March 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2010/04/24-1 | title=WellPoint Routinely Targets Breast Cancer Patients | publisher=Common Dreams | date=April 24, 2000}}</ref>

In July 2008, Anthem Blue Cross agreed to a settlement with the [[California Department of Managed Health Care]]; however in doing so, WellPoint did not officially admit liability. To resolve allegations of improper policy rescissions (cancellations), WellPoint paid $10 million and reinstated plans for 1,770 policy-holders who were affected by cancelled policies. The company also agreed to provide compensation for any [[medical debt]]s incurred by these policy-holders.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2008/07/17/health-insurers-to-pay-state-regulators/ | title=Health insurers to pay state regulators | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[East Bay Times]] | date=July 17, 2008}}</ref>

In April 2010, Reuters alleged that Wellpoint "using a [[computer algorithm]], identified women recently diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] and then singled them out for cancellation of their policies."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellpoint-breastcancer1/corrected-wellpoint-routinely-targets-breast-cancer-patients-idUSTRE63M5D420100423 | title=WellPoint routinely targets breast cancer patients | first=Murray | last=Waas | work=[[Reuters]] | date=April 23, 2010}}</ref> The story not only caused considerable public outrage, but it also led Secretary of Health and Human Services, [[Kathleen Sebelius]], and President [[Barack Obama]], to call on WellPoint to end the practice.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2010/05/how-wellpoint-s-bad-behavior-advances-health-care-reform.html | title=How WellPoint's bad behavior advances health care reform. | first=TIMOTHY | last=NOAH | work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=May 10, 2010}}</ref>

In 2011, Anthem began cancelling policies of members who had been paying premiums with [[credit card]]s, sometimes without calling or emailing the member ahead of time.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-sep-20-la-fi-lazarus-20110920-story.html | title=Using plastic to pay Anthem bill?

===Opposition to health care reform ===
The former Vice President for Public Policy and External Affairs at WellPoint, Elizabeth Fowler, is the Senior Counsel to [[Max Baucus]], the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a leading opponent of the public option in health care reform.

In August 2009, Anthem, the largest for-profit insurer in California, contacted its employees and urged them to get involved to oppose [[health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration]]. Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit watchdog organization in Santa Monica, asked California Atty. Gen. [[Jerry Brown]] to investigate its claim that WellPoint had illegally pushed workers to write to their elected officials, attend town hall meetings and enlist family and friends to ensure an overhaul that would match the firmâ€™s interests. According to Consumer Watchdog, California's labor code directly prohibits coercive communications, including forbidding employers from controlling, coercing or influencing employees' political activities or affiliations. WellPoint had not been contacted by the California attorney general and had not seen any complaint.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-sep-03-fi-insurers-reform3-story.html | first=Carol J. | last=Williams | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | title=2 giant health insurers accused of illegal steps to thwart change | date=September 3, 2009 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

Through 2010 and into 2011, WellPoint senior executives met monthly with executives of other major health insurers to blunt the effect of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].<ref>{{cite news | title=UnitedHealth Joins WellPoint to hone Health Law Lobby | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-01-31/unitedhealth-joins-wellpoint-in-alliance-aiming-to-hone-health-law-lobby | first=Drew | last=Armstrong | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=January 31, 2011}}</ref>

===2009 premium increase in Maine===
In 2009, Anthem Health Plans of Maine, a WellPoint subsidiary, sued the state of [[Maine]] for the right to increase premiums further.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://seminal.firedoglake.com/diary/8735 | title=WellPoint Sues Maine To Raise Premiums 18.5% - MyFDL | work=firedoglake.com}}</ref> Since Maine licenses insurance companies through its Department of Insurance, Anthem needed the state's permission to raise rates.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wellpoint-subsidiary-figh_n_309529 | work=[[HuffPost]] | first=Arthur | last=Delaney | title=WellPoint Subsidiary Fights Maine Over Big Rate Hike (VIDEO) | date=October 5, 2009}}</ref> The Court disagreed with Anthem and found that, unlike with other forms of insurance, the Maine Insurance Code does not require the Superintendent to consider profits.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mainecahc.org/wp-content/uploads/Anthem_summary.pdf | title=Summary of Key Points of Anthem Health Plans of Maine, Inc. v. Superintendent of Insurance, Maine Attorney General, and Consumers for Affordable Health Care}}</ref>

===2010 premium increase in California===
In February 2010, WellPoint announced that rates would increase on some Anthem Blue Cross individual policies in California by as high as 39%. The announcement resulted in an investigation by regulators from the Federal and California governments.<ref name=raises/> Anthem Blue Cross gained worldwide media attention and became a [[poster child]] for the problem of rising cost of health care in the U.S.<ref name=raises/> The rate increase came one year after Anthem had raised rates 68% on individual policy holders.<ref name=raises>{{cite news | url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Anthem-Blue-Cross-raises-premiums-3273960.php | title=Anthem blue cross raises premiums | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | first=Victoria | last=Colliver | date=February 6, 2010}}</ref>

To explain the rate increases, some which were four times the rate of medical inflation, Anthem said the company had experienced a death spiral: the company claimed that with increased [[unemployment]] and declining [[wages]], healthy customers dropped their insurance policies. Consequently, the remaining risk pool became sicker and thus more expensive to insure; and, in turn, prices were forced up and pushed more people out of the market.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/health/policy/16anthem.html | title=In California, Exhibit A in Debate on Insurance | first=Kevin | last=Sack | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 16, 2010 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

In response to the outrage from politicians and consumers, Anthem postponed the rate increase until May 1, 2010.<ref>{{cite news |

Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] of California proposed giving the [[Federal government of the United States]] authority to block insurance premium hikes that it considers to be "unjustified".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2010/02/19/feinstein-takes-on-anthem-blue-cross-over-premium-hikes/ | title=Feinstein takes on anthem blue cross | first=MIKE | last=ZAPLER | work=[[San Jose Mercury News]] | date=February 19, 2010}}</ref>

===Reclassifying expenses===
On 17 March 2010, WellPoint announced it was reclassifying some of its administrative costs as medical care costs in order to meet [[loss ratio]] requirements under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], which requires insurers to spend at least 80% or 85% of customer premiums on health care services, depending on the type of plan.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://thinkprogress.org/wellpoint-reclassifies-costs-as-medical-care-to-meet-reform-s-medical-loss-ratio-requirement-e571747d68f4/ | title=WellPoint Reclassifies Costs As 'Medical Care' To Meet Reform's Medical Loss Ratio Requirement | first=Igor | last=Volsky | work=[[Think Progress]] | date=March 31, 2010}}</ref>

===2009-10 security breach===
In June 2010, Anthem sent letters to 230,000 customers in California warning them that their personal data might have been accessed online via a [[data breach]]. After a routine upgrade in October 2009, a third-party vendor stated that all security measures had been properly reinstated, when in fact they had not. As a result, personal information of thousands of coverage applicants who were under the age of 65 was exposed in the open. After a Los Angeles-area woman found that her application for coverage was publicly available, she filed a [[class action]] lawsuit against Anthem. While gathering evidence for the proceeding, the woman's lawyers downloaded some confidential customer information from Anthem's website and alerted Anthem about the breach. According to the lawyers, confidential information had remained exposed for five months.<ref>{{cite news | last=Perkes | first=Courtney | url=https://www.ocregister.com/2010/06/24/personal-data-accessed-on-blue-cross-website/ | title=Personal data accessed on insurer Web site | work=[[Orange County Register]] | date=October 23, 2010}}</ref>

===Denial of benefits===
In May 2014, Anthem Blue Cross refused to pay for the hospitalization of a [[Sonoma County, California]] man for [[stage four cancer]]s, although he had paid Anthem over $100,000 in premiums.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/05/28/health-insurance-provider-denies-cancer-treatment-premium-mri-scan-tumor-sonoma-county-man-battling-cancer-denied-coverage-by-anthem-blue-cross-after-paying-100k-in-premiums/ | title=Sonoma County Man Battling Cancer Denied Coverage By Anthem Blue Cross After Paying $100K In Premiums | first=Andria | last=Borba | work=[[KPIX-TV]] | date=May 28, 2014}} includes video and transcript of coverage.</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://zoekeating.tumblr.com/post/86148140639/unbelievable | title=Unbelievable | publisher=tumblr.com | date=May 18, 2014}}</ref> Anthem ended up paying for coverage following public outcry.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/05/30/anthem-blue-cross-to-cover-sonoma-county-cancer-patient-after-kpix-5-report-health-insurance-provider-denies-treatment-premium-mri-scan-tumor-paying-100k-in-premiums-jeffrey-rusch-zoe-keating/ | title=Anthem Blue Cross To Cover Sonoma County Cancer Patient After KPIX 5 Report | work=cbslocal.com}}</ref>

===2015 medical data breach===
{{main|Anthem medical data breach}}
On February 4, 2015, Anthem, Inc. disclosed that criminal hackers had broken into its servers and potentially stolen over 37.5 million records that contain [[personally identifiable information]] from its servers. According to Anthem, Inc., the data breach extended into multiple [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association#Member companies|brands Anthem, Inc. uses]] to market its healthcare plans, including, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, [[Amerigroup]], [[Caremore]], and [[UniCare]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/data-breach-at-health-insurer-anthem-could-impact-millions/ | title=Data Breach at Health Insurer Anthem Could Impact Millions | work=[[Brian Krebs]] | date=February 4, 2015}}</ref> Healthlink was also victimized.
