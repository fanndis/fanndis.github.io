'''Maidenhead''' is a [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituency]]{{#tag:ref|A [[county constituency]] (for the purposes of election expenses and type of returning officer)|group= n}} in [[Berkshire]] represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]. Since its creation at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] General Election, the seat has been held by Conservative Member of Parliament [[Theresa May]] who served as [[Home Secretary]] from 2010 to 2016 and as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] from 2016 to 2019.

It is considered a [[safe seat]] for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], as it has never been held by any party other than the Conservatives; nor had any of its predecessor constituencies.

== History ==
The constituency was first drawn shortly after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]]. The electorate of [[Maidenhead]] and Windsor was becoming too large, so the [[Boundary Commission for England]] separated the seats for the next election, due in 1996 or 1997. It was formed from parts of the abolished safe seat of [[Windsor and Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor and Maidenhead]] and the constituency of [[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wokingham]]. It was first used in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]]. [[Theresa May]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] from 2016 to 2019, has held the seat since its creation. In 1995, May, a former London councillor at the time working at the [[Association for Payment Clearing Services]] and as a Foreign affairs advisor, was selected to contest the new seat, defeating her future [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Philip Hammond]], in the selection process. (Hammond was later selected for the nearby seat of [[Runnymede and Weybridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Runnymede and Weybridge]]). May won the seat in the 1997 election, in which over 100 Conservatives lost their seats, and the party obtained its lowest share of seats in 91 years. At the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] May achieved the 9th highest share of the vote of the 307 seats held by a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/elections/results/general_elections|title=Electoral Commission – Previous UK general elections|publisher=}}</ref>

The closest election in the seat was in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], in which May's majority was cut from almost 12,000 votes in 1997 to just 3,284 votes ahead of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] candidate.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20111015054450/http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_2001ob.txt </ref> The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate in that election was activist and comedy writer [[John O'Farrell (author)|John O'Farrell]], whose campaign was the subject of a BBC documentary entitled ''Losing My Maidenhead''.

Due to their strong performance in 2001, the seat was one of several targeted by the Liberal Democrats in 2005 as part of a 'decapitation strategy' to deprive senior Conservatives of their seats; as with similar efforts in [[Haltemprice and Howden (UK Parliament constituency)|Haltemprice and Howden]] and [[West Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|West Dorset]], however, this strategy was unsuccessful: May retained her seat with almost double her 2001 majority. Since then, she has held it with majorities of at least 30%.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

== Constituency profile ==
Housing is, in the Wokingham district part,{{clarify|date=July 2016}} at the northern end of a belt where more than 40% of dwellings are detached houses, and less than 10.8% are purpose-built flats or tenements (maisonettes) (2011 figures, by district)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-interactive-content/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129132219/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-interactive-content/index.html|url-status=dead|title=2011 census interactive maps|archivedate=29 January 2016}}</ref> Reflecting a national trend in this period, the latter band{{clarify|date=July 2016}} was in 2001 a band of fewer than 8% of housing stock as flats.  The other borough, namely [[Windsor and Maidenhead]], is the district with the most expensive house prices in the country outside of [[Greater London]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/uk_house_prices/regions/html/region9.stm|title=BBC News, UK House prices, South East|date=21 October 2013|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> The seat is located in the technology-rich [[M4 corridor]], which includes the largest company headquarters estate in Europe at [[Slough Trading Estate|Slough]]; and though most of the communities have slower links{{clarify|date=January 2020}} to London than [[Maidenhead]] town centre, they instead have close links to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Bracknell]]. A minority commute to the [[City of London]], which is just under one hour's commute from the two [[Great Western Main Line|mainline]] stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk |title=National Rail Enquiries – Official source for UK train times and timetables|publisher=}}</ref> Communities in the area will also benefit from the eventual opening of [[Crossrail]], with trains running direct from Maidenhead and Twyford to the City of London and Stratford. The seat includes the renowned restaurants, the [[Fat Duck]] at Bray and the [[Waterside Inn]]. There are low hills in the north of the seat and the [[Chiltern Hills]] further to the north. Taking the constituent [[electoral ward]] results since the decline of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in the 1910s, the area has always been a [[safe seat]] for [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidates. One broadsheet political column encapsulated the constituency as a "seat of [[River Thames|Thamesside]] towns",<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/constituency/1105/maidenhead Constituency Profile] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref> these house a majority of its residents other than [[Twyford, Berkshire|Twyford]]{{clarify|date=January 2020}} which spans the multi-stream [[River Loddon|river in the town]]. The agriculture in the area consists of some pasture, fields of wheat and fruit.

== Boundaries and boundary changes ==
The constituency borders the constituencies of [[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading East]], [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]], [[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Wycombe]], [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]], [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor]], [[Bracknell (UK Parliament constituency)|Bracknell]] and [[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wokingham]]. The seat's largest settlement is the town of [[Maidenhead]] in the [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead]], Berkshire. It includes the following wards:
