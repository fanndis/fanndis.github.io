'''Antonio Ramón Villaraigosa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|iː|ə|r|aɪ|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|s|ə}}; [[né]] '''Villar Jr.'''; born January 23, 1953) is an American politician who was the 41st [[Mayor of Los Angeles]], from 2005 to 2013.

Before becoming mayor, he was a member of the [[California State Assembly]] (1994–2000), where he served as the Democratic Majority Leader (1996–98), and the [[Speaker of the California State Assembly]] (1998–2000). As Speaker, Villaraigosa was an advocate for working families and helped to write legislation protecting the environment, expanding healthcare access, and increasing funding for public schools.

He ran for mayor in [[Los Angeles mayoral election, 2001|2001]] against [[Los Angeles City Attorney]] [[James Hahn]], but lost in the second round of voting. Villaraigosa ran for and was elected to the [[Los Angeles City Council]] in 2003. In 2005, he [[Los Angeles mayoral election, 2005|ran for mayor]] again in a rematch against Hahn and won. During his tenure as mayor, he gained national attention for his work and was featured in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time's]]'' story on the country's 25 most influential [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]]s. He was the first [[Mexican American]] in over 130 years to have served as Mayor of Los Angeles. As Mayor, Villaraigosa spearheaded policies to improve student outcomes in the Los Angeles Unified School District, reduce city and highway traffic, and enhance public safety.

Since leaving office in 2013, Villaraigosa has continued to be actively engaged in education, civic engagement, water, immigration, transportation, and economic development issues. He speaks nationally and throughout California on these issues.

Villaraigosa is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and was a national co-chairman of [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign]], a member of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s Transition Economic Advisory Board,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Michael A.|title=Economic Advisers Represent Wide Range - washingtonpost.com|language=en-US|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/13/AR2008111303994.html|access-date=2020-12-01|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> and Chairman of the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]] in September 2012.<ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/14/news/la-pn-villaraigosa-democratic-convention-chair-20120214 "Villaraigosa will chair Democratic National Convention], Los Angeles Times, February 14, 2012</ref>

Villar went on to attend [[East Los Angeles College]],<ref>[[#refNewYorker|The New Yorker]]</ref> a [[community college]], and eventually transferred to [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in History in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Chancellor-Carnesale-Mayor-Villaraigosa-7044|title=Chancellor Carnesale, Mayor Villaraigosa Top List of UCLA Commencement Speakers|first=Phil|last=Hampton|website=UCLA Newsroom|access-date=2018-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612150316/http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Chancellor-Carnesale-Mayor-Villaraigosa-7044|archive-date=2018-06-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> At UCLA, he was a leader of [[MEChA]], an organization that seeks to promote [[Chicano]] unity and empowerment through political action, but later renounced his association with the group citing its controversial stances on race.

In 1990, Villaraigosa was appointed to the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Board, where he served until 1994. In 1994, he was elected to the [[California State Assembly]]. Within his first term, he was selected to serve as Democratic Assembly Whip and Assembly Majority Leader. In 1998, Villaraigosa was chosen by his colleagues to be the Speaker of the Assembly, the first from Los Angeles in 25 years.

===Elections===

Villaraigosa ran for election as [[Mayor of Los Angeles]] in [[Los Angeles mayoral election, 2001|the 2001 citywide contest]], but was defeated by [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[James Hahn]] in a run-off election. In 2003, Villaraigosa defeated incumbent Councilman [[Nick Pacheco]] to win a seat on the [[Los Angeles City Council]] representing the 14th District.

Villaraigosa placed first in the primary for the [[Los Angeles mayoral election, 2005|Los Angeles mayoral election]] of March 8, 2005, and won the run-off election on May 17, receiving 58.7% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050518/news_7n18lamayor.html "Villaraigosa cruises to victory"], ''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', May 18, 2005</ref> On July 1, 2005, Villaraigosa was sworn in as the 41st [[Mayor of Los Angeles]]. He became the first Latino Mayor of Los Angeles since 1872, when [[Cristóbal Aguilar]] (who served from 1866–68 and again from 1870–72) held the office. Attendees to his first inauguration included then Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]; former Governors [[Gray Davis]], [[Pete Wilson]], and [[Jerry Brown]]; former Vice President [[Al Gore]], U.S. Secretary of State [[Warren Christopher]], and [[New York City]] Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].<ref>[[#refBruin|UCLA Daily Bruin, 2005-07-05]]</ref><ref>[[#refUSAToday|USA Today, 2005-07-01]]</ref>

Villaraigosa was re-elected in 2009, receiving 55.65% of the vote against his most prominent challenger, attorney [[Walter Moore (politician)|Walter Moore]] who won 26.23% of the vote. Villaraigosa drew controversy by refusing to debate any of his opponents before the election, namely Walter Moore.<ref>[[#refRefuse|Los Angeles Times, 2009-02-04]]</ref><ref>[[#refRefund|The Occidental Weekly, 2009-02-18]]</ref><ref>[[#refRecall|Mayor Sam's Sister City, 2009-06-03]]</ref>

===Tenure===

====Transportation====
[[File:Obama listens to Antonio Villaraigosa.jpg|thumb|left|Villaraigosa speaks at a meeting on infrastructure investment in the White House as President [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Transportation Secretary]] [[Ray LaHood]] look on.]]

One of Villaraigosa's main transportation-related goals is to extend the [[Purple Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Purple Line subway]] down [[Wilshire Boulevard]] to [[Santa Monica]]. Proponents have dubbed the project the "Subway to the Sea." Villaraigosa worked to persuade Congressman [[Henry Waxman]] to repeal the ban on subway tunneling in Los Angeles, which occurred in 2006.

On November 4, 2008, Los Angeles County voters passed [[Los Angeles County Sales Tax, Measure R (2008)|Measure R]], an additional half-cent per dollar sales tax that increased the sales tax rate in Los Angeles County from 8.25% to 8.75% and is projected to generate up to $40 billion over 30 years for transportation.<ref>Hymon, Steve (30 October 2008). "A Closer Look at Half-Cent Sales Tax Hike, Measure R". Los Angeles Times. http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/30/local/me-roadsage30</ref> Measure R included funding for the portion of the "Subway to the Sea" between Wilshire/Western and Westwood/VA Hospital; a project known as the [[Westside Subway Extension]].<ref>Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, "Proposed One-Half Cent Sales Tax for Transportation: Outline of Expenditure Categories," 13 August 2008. {{cite web |url=http://www.metro.net/measurer/images/expenditure_plan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509085849/http://www.metro.net/measurer/images/expenditure_plan.pdf |archive-date=2011-05-09 }}</ref> Its passage was credited in large part to Villaraigosa, who lobbied the Metropolitan Transportation Agency and County Board of Supervisors to place it on the November ballot, and helped organize the fundraising efforts.<ref>[[#reflatimesblogs1]]</ref>

Working with [[Wendy Greuel]], then Chair of the City Council's Transportation Committee, Villaraigosa issued an executive directive aimed at banning road construction during rush hour in traffic-plagued Los Angeles, and established anti-gridlock zones and launched Tiger Teams to improve traffic flow during peak rush hour times. Villaraigosa even publicly pledged to take the subway to work one day a month, as reported by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. This, however, proved impossible for him.

In February 2010, Villaraigosa traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] in order to promote a "Ten/Thirty" plan that requests an $8.8 billion [[bridge loan]] to augment the $5.8 billion expected from [[Measure R]] tax revenues. Proceeds would accelerate the construction of 12 mass transit projects. The loan would be repaid with continuing income from [[Measure R]] funds.<ref>{{cite web|author=Yonah Freemark March 1st, 2010 |url=http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2010/03/01/how-feasible-is-antonio-villaraigosas-3010-gambit-for-los-angeles-transit/ |title=How Feasible is Antonio Villaraigosa's 30/10 Gambit for Los Angeles Transit?

====Public safety====
As mayor, Villaraigosa was a member of the [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition]],<ref>[[#refGuns|Mayors Against Illegal Guns]]{{Failed verification|date=June 2010}}</ref> a national organization of Mayors whose goal is to increase gun control. While mayor, Villaraigosa pursued an agenda of making Los Angeles the safest big city in America.<ref>[http://mayor.lacity.org/MeettheMayor/index.htm MEET THE MAYOR, Antonio R.

Villaraigosa has proposed a Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness initiative, which adds certain units to the Los Angeles Police and Fire Departments and reorganizes some of the current practices. Villaraigosa's latest development in the policy realm of homeland security is the creation of his Homeland Security Advisors, a group of approximately 40 leaders. The panel includes Police Chief [[William Bratton]], former L.A. [[FBI]] chief [[Ron Iden]], former Mayor [[Richard Riordan]], Los Angeles County Sheriff [[Lee Baca]] and former District Attorney [[Ira Reiner]]. It will be co-chaired by his Deputy Mayor for [[Homeland Security]] and Public Safety [[Arif Alikhan]]. The panel planned for such issues as counter-terrorism measures, evacuation planning and emergency preparedness.<ref>[[#refTerror|Los Angeles Times, 2006-02-17]]</ref>

Villaraigosa vowed to hire 1,000 new police officers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caivn.org/article/2010/04/21/mayor-villaraigosa-proposes-merge-lapd-citys-public-safety-workers?quicktabs_3=0 |title=Mayor Villaraigosa proposes to merge LAPD with city's public safety workers |publisher=CAIVN |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref> On March 6, 2009, Mayor Villaraigosa and Police Chief Bratton announced that the L.A.P.D. had expanded to its largest force in city history.<ref>[[#refNAM|Los Angeles Sentinel, 2009-03-09]]</ref> On May 14, 2009, City Council approved an LAPD/LAFD hiring freeze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbs2.com/local/Hiring.Freeze.Los.2.1009418.html |title=City Council Approves LAPD, LAFD Hiring Freeze |publisher=cbs2.com |date=2009-05-14 |accessdate=2010-08-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105201115/http://cbs2.com/local/Hiring.Freeze.Los.2.1009418.html |archive-date=January 5, 2010 }}</ref> In a television advertisement paid for by the Villaraigosa campaign, Chief Bratton stated that "Crime is down to levels of the 1950s." Twenty-four hours before the March 3 Election Day, Villaraigosa and Bratton reannounced a statement from the Mayor's Office that the "citywide crime-rate drop to the lowest level since 1956, the total number of homicides fall[ing] to a 38-year low. Gang homicides were down more than 24 percent in 2008."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lapd.com/news/headlines/bratton_la_is_as_safe_as_1956/ |title=LAPPL – Los Angeles Police Protective League: Bratton: L.A.

In fact, crime fell by 43 percent across California between 1994 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/2005/3_Strikes/3_strikes_102005.htm |title=A Primer: Three Strikes: The Impact After More Than a Decade |publisher=Lao.ca.gov |date=1996-06-20 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref> The figures are also disputed by Patrick Range McDonald and Professor Andrew Karmen, John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Karmen stated that, adjusting for population, the Los Angeles murder rate would need to be 180 or less to be equivalent to the crime rate of 1956, with its rate of 104 homicides per 2.2 million people, or one killing for every 22,115 people (the 2007 rate was 396 per 4 million people, or one killing per 10,101 people). McDonald further noted that, "In 1956, 89 percent of homicides were cleared. Today, if you kill another human being in Los Angeles, chances are very good you will get away with it: 43 out of every 100 killers are not caught." Similarly, he notes, "In 1956, 42 percent of robberies were cleared by an arrest. Today, that number is 26 percent."<ref>{{cite news|author=Patrick Range McDonald |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-04-30/news/bratton-l-a-is-as-safe-as-1956/5 |title=Bratton: L.A.

====Education====

Villaraigosa sought to gain control of the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] (LAUSD) as one of his top priorities as mayor, but instead was able to create the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools, a subset of LAUSD comprising the district's lowest-performing schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/09/local/la-me-villaraigosa-speech-20130410|title=Villaraigosa, in city address, notes gains, chides Garcetti and Greuel|first=Kate|last=Linthicum|date=9 April 2013|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">[[#refeconomistschools|The Economist, 2005-10-27]]</ref>

Because LAUSD includes many other municipalities outside the city of Los Angeles, Villaraigosa wanted to engage all of the elected officials in those cities. He brought together union leaders and state legislators to create a Council of Mayors of the 28 cities served by LAUSD.<ref name="autogenerated2005"/> The votes of each Mayor would be proportionate to the city's population.<ref name="autogenerated2005"/>

In response, Villaraigosa founded a non-profit entity called the Mayor's Partnership for Los Angeles Schools to take control of the district's lowest-performing schools and transform them into high-performing schools. The Partnership eventually managed 21 LAUSD campuses, which operate under the same labor contract as LAUSD. Though schools in the Partnership were among the lowest performing in the district, they eventually made the largest gains in the state based on California's Annual Performance Index measure, and are now considered among the best performing urban schools in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://partnershipla.org/Our_schools/Data |title=Partnership for Los Angeles Schools, School Data |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521000306/http://partnershipla.org/Our_schools/Data |archive-date=2015-05-21 }}</ref> The Partnership has generated some controversy since its founding. In June 2009, teachers at eight of the ten campuses cast a vote of "no confidence" in the Partnership.<ref>Lopez, Steve.

In his final state of the City speech as Mayor of Los Angeles, Villaraigosa reiterated his commitment to education reform and expressed concern that the other Mayoral candidates did not share the same commitment to education in Los Angeles. "Education can't be a footnote on a campaign mailer or fodder for an attack ad," Villaraigosa said in his speech at UCLA's Royce Hall. "It's time for our candidates to demonstrate the 'fierce urgency of now' when it comes to ensuring that all of our children have access to great schools."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scpr.org/blogs/politics/2013/04/09/13236/live-video-mayor-villaraigosa-s-final-state-of-the |title= Antonio Villaraigosa's final State of the City speech: The mayor issues schools challenge (video)}}</ref>

====Animal services====
In January 2005, Villaraigosa appeared before a coalition of animal rights activists and pledged that, if elected, he would implement a no-kill policy for Animal Services and fire General Manager Guerdon Stuckey, an appointee of former Mayor Hahn. Animal activists had expressed doubts regarding Stuckey's ability to lead the Department of Animal Service since his appointment, primarily citing his lack of experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NEW+ANIMAL+SERVICES+CHIEF+OK'D+ACTIVISTS+PROTEST+STUCKEY'S+LACK+OF...-a0124524677 |title=New Animal Services Chief Ok'D Activists Protest Stuckey'S Lack Of Experience. – Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref> During Stuckey's tenure, activist concern intensified due to a refusal to accept charity-sponsored spay and neuter services, firings of several key animal rights-oriented workers, and excessive euthanasia of animals held by Animal Services.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Approximately one year after Villaraigosa's initial promise to fire Stuckey and substantial negative press, Villaraigosa fired Stuckey. Stuckey appealed the firing to the City Council and threatened a lawsuit, and in February 2006, the Los Angeles City Council awarded Stuckey a $50,000 consulting fee with the agreement that there would be no lawsuit. In January 2006, Villaraigosa appointed Ed Boks to the General Manager position.<ref>[[#refLAWeekly|LA Weekly, 2005-12-22]]</ref> In April 2009, General Manager Ed Boks resigned after complaints from some staff, city councillors, and animal advocates.<ref>{{cite news |date=2009-04-24 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2009/04/controversial-la-animal-services-general-manager-ed-boks-resigns.html |title=Controversial L.A.

====Taxes====
Villaraigosa has tripled the city's trash collection fee from $11 per month to $36.32 per month for single-family homes, stating: "Every new dollar residents pay for trash pickup will be used to put more officers on the streets," in a press release dated April 12, 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/09/local/me-newcops9 |title=Trash tax doesn't just hire police – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2008-07-09 |accessdate=2010-08-03 | first=David | last=Zahniser}}</ref> A 2008 L.A. City Controller audit by Laura Chick determined that 2008 "only $47 million, or about one-third of the new trash-fee revenue then pouring into city coffers, went to hiring police, and only 366 officers were hired instead of the promised 1,000."<ref>{{cite news|author=Patrick Range McDonald |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-10-15/news/long-knives-slice-up-bratton/ |title=Long Knives Slice Up Bratton – Page 1 – News – Los Angeles |newspaper=LA Weekly |date=2009-10-15 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref>

Villaraigosa then lobbied to place Proposition S on the ballot to fund new police officers, concerned that a pending court ruling could eliminate the 40-year-old 10% telephone tax.<ref name="articles.latimes.com">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/17/local/me-phonetax17 |title=Council places phone tax on ballot – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2010-08-03 | first=David | last=Zahniser}}</ref> This generated some controversy among tax activists, as Villaraigosa and his negotiating team had recently reached a salary agreement resulting in a 23% pay hike.<ref name="articles.latimes.com"/> Controller Laura Chick noted that Proposition S language does not restrict expenditure to police and firefighters, and instead deposits the money into the general fund.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tibby Rothman |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-02-07/news/city-hall-s-black-hole/ |title=Proposition S: City Hall's Black Hole – Page 1 – News – Los Angeles |newspaper=LA Weekly |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref> It is not certain that any of the Prop S monies were used to hire new police officers. Villaraigosa supports Proposition O, which currently adds $10.22 to the property tax bill of a $350,000 home and will eventually climb to $35.00. Villaraigosa also campaigned last fall for two education bond measures that will increase the size of property tax bills over the next decade.<ref>[[#refLATimes55|Los Angeles Times, 2009-04-23]]</ref>

On March 23, 2010, Villaraigosa, in a leaked memo warned the Los Angeles City Council that their potential failure to support a series of four proposed rate increases totaling 37% and already approved by the city's Department of Water and Power would be "the most immediate and direct route to bankruptcy the city could pursue".<ref>{{cite news |date=2010-03-23 | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/03/villaraigosa-warns-of-bankruptcy-if-la-council-blocks-power-rate-hike.html |title=Villaraigosa warns of bankruptcy if L.A.

===Energy and the environment===
In April 2008, Villaraigosa set aside a large parcel of industrial land around the [[Los Angeles River]] to create a "clean-technology corridor."{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Discussions have started with international companies about relocating to the corridor and a range of incentives are available for businesses opting to move to the city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The site will include a research facility that will draw on the engineering talents of local higher-education institutions, such as the [[California Institute of Technology]] and [[UCLA]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} About {{convert|20|acre|m2}} has also been set aside for a manufacturing center.<ref>[[#refLAist|LAist.com, 2008-09-23]]</ref> As of August 2010, the project is still in the planning stage.

Villaraigosa played a critical role in establishing the [[LA Cleantech Incubator]] and voiced his support for the organization during the night of their opening.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/los-angeles-cleantech-incubator-officially-launches-131441048.html/| title= Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator Officially Launches| date= 10 October 2011| publisher= PR Newswire| accessdate= 6 March 2012}}</ref>

===Honorary degrees and awards===
In February 2006, Villaraigosa was presented with the [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] Legacy Foundation Achievement Award for "following in the footsteps of the first [[African American]] Mayor of Los Angeles who served the city for 51 years." Citing the similarity of the two mayors in building coalitions among diverse communities, the speakers praised Villaraigosa for his vision for the City of Los Angeles. Also in attendance were Mrs. Ethel Bradley, daughter Lorraine and many of Mayor Bradley's former staff members.<ref>[[#refBradley|Tom Bradley Legacy Foundation at UCLA]]</ref>

On May 6, 2006, Villaraigosa was awarded an honorary degree by [[Loyola Marymount University]], and was the Class of 2006 Commencement Speaker. On May 12, 2006, he was awarded a [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] by the [[University of Southern California]] and was the Class of 2006 commencement speaker.<ref>[[#refUSC|USC]]</ref><ref>[[#refOrlov|InsideSocal.com]]</ref> In June 2006, Villaraigosa received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{Cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement| url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#public-service| website=www.achievement.org}}</ref> In 2007, he was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] from [[Whittier College]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Honorary Degrees |url=https://www.whittier.edu/alumni/poetnation/honorary |website=Whittier College |access-date=28 January 2019}}</ref>

==International publicity==

In October 2006, Villaraigosa traveled to [[England]] and [[Asia]] for a sixteen-day trade mission. In England, he visited [[London]] and [[Manchester]], at the invitation of then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]], and spoke about Los Angeles' efforts regarding global warming, homeland security and emergency preparedness, and its bid for the [[2016 Olympic Games]]. Prime Minister Blair had visited Mayor Villaraigosa a couple months prior to that in Los Angeles.<ref>[[#refLATimes77|Los Angeles Times, 2006-09-20]]</ref>

In 2006, Villaraigosa led a delegation of over 50 business leaders to [[China]], [[South Korea]], and [[Japan]] that secured $300 million in direct foreign investment. In [[Beijing]], Villaraigosa opened a LA Inc. tourism office, in order to ensure a permanent welcome for the millions of Chinese tourists who will visit Los Angeles over the next decade. In Japan, Villaraigosa launched a See My LA advertising campaign in Tokyo-based Family Mart convenience stores throughout Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

In February 2008, Villaraigosa welcomed Mexican President [[Felipe Calderón Hinojosa]] and members of the Mexican delegation to discuss trade opportunities and witness the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Mexico Business Council for Foreign Trade, Investment and Technology (COMCE) and the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.<ref>[[#refGlobal|City Of Los Angeles]]</ref>

Villaraigosa traveled to [[Israel]] in June 2008 to meet with experts in homeland security, counter-terrorism, and green technology. He also signed an agreement with the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT – part the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya) on behalf of the LA police department. Under the agreement, the ICT will train US homeland security officials.<ref>[[#refJpost|The Jerusalem Post, 2008-07-19]]</ref> In recent years, he developed a relationship with the Mayor of the Israeli city of [[Sderot]], Eli Moyal, and met with him during the visit.<ref>[[#refYnet|Yedioth Internet, 2008-06-13]]</ref> Villaraigosa has long retained strong ties to the Los Angeles Jewish Community, having spent part of his childhood in the once-Jewish dominated neighborhood of Boyle Heights.<ref>[[#refForward|Jewish Daily Forward, 2008-02-20]]</ref>

==Criticisms and controversies==
[[File:Antonio Villaraigosa LA Pride 2011.jpg|thumb|Villaraigosa at [[LA/Valley Pride|Los Angeles Pride]] 2011]]
In June 2009, Villaraigosa made the cover of [[Los Angeles Magazine]], titled "Failure," with an accompanying article written by Ed Leibowitz, which claimed that Villaraigosa often confused campaigning with governance, wasted 22 weeks in his first term trying to take over the school board, and did little to help education in the City of Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamag.com/citythink/citythinkblog/2013/04/10/villaraigosas-lasting-legacy-you-fail-sometimes |title=Villaraigosa's Lasting Legacy: You Fail Sometimes}}</ref>

In February 2010, ''La Opinion'' staffer Isaiah Alvarado noted that Villaraigosa's call for job and cuts in city departments did not include his own staff of 205 employees, compared to 121 staffers for Hahn and 114 for Riordan. Alvarado also noted that even after a 10% reduction, the Mayor's office spent $1.8 million more than Hahn in the last year of his administration and $1.4 million more than Riordan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.impre.com/laopinion/noticias/2010/2/26/intocable-la-nomina-del-alcald-175247-1.html |title=La Opinión – noticias locales, nacionales e internacionales desde Los Ángeles – impre.com – Intocable la nómina del alcalde |publisher=impre.com |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref> This budget does not include the annual $118,000 covering of the Getty House, the official residence of the Mayor of Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cityclerk.lacity.org/lacityclerkconnect/index.cfm?fa=ccon.viewrecord&contractnum=C-115759 |title=C-115759 (Contracts) |publisher=Cityclerk.lacity.org |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref>

===Ethics violations===
On May 2, 2007, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Villaraigosa was under investigation for ethics violations: "The executive director of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission...accused Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of 31 violations of campaign finance and disclosure laws stemming from his 2003 campaign for the City Council."<ref>[[#refMcgreevy|Los Angeles Times, 2007-05-02]]</ref>

In June 2010, a formal ethics investigation of Villaraigosa was launched due to his unreported acceptance of 81 tickets to concerts, awards ceremonies and sporting events.<ref>{{cite web |author=Scott Martelle Contributor |url=http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/los-angeles-mayor-antonio-villaraigosa-faces-ethics-review-over-free-tickets/19500262 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116100916/http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/los-angeles-mayor-antonio-villaraigosa-faces-ethics-review-over-free-tickets/19500262 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-11-16 |title=Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa Faces Ethics Review Over Free Tickets |publisher=Aolnews.com |accessdate=2010-08-03 }}</ref> Estimates—including the 13 Lakers courtside tickets valued at $3,100 each<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/city-news/villaraigosa-lakers-tickets-ae/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716070114/http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/city-news/villaraigosa-lakers-tickets-ae/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-16 |title=Some Of Mayor Villaraigosa's Prime Lakers Tickets Are Gifts From Staples Center Owner – Los Angeles News – The Informer |publisher=Blogs.laweekly.com |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2010-08-03 }}</ref> and Academy Awards and Governor's Ball tickets at $21,000 each—suggest that the value of the tickets could amount to tens of thousands of dollars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.lalate.com/2010/06/12/villaraigosa-free-tickets-scandal/ |title=Villaraigosa Free Tickets Scandal |publisher=News.lalate.com |date=2010-06-12 |accessdate=2010-08-03| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100620135802/http://news.lalate.com/2010/06/12/villaraigosa-free-tickets-scandal/| archive-date= 20 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>

===2012 DNC controversy===
At the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]], where Villaraigosa was chairman, the original 2012 party platform caused controversy after it was written, because of the lack of typical invocations and references to [[God]] and God-given rights, as well as lack of language affirming the role of [[Jerusalem]] as the capital of [[Israel]]. Both of these matters had been included in some previous platforms. On the second day, September 5, former Ohio Governor [[Ted Strickland]] introduced an amendment on the floor of the convention to re-insert language invoking God and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Convention Chairman Villaraigosa put the amendment to a voice vote requiring a two-thirds majority for passage. After the first vote had greater volume of "nays", Villaraigosa called for a second vote, which was again met with greater volume of "nays" than "yays". A woman standing to his left said, "You've got to rule, and then you've got to let them do what they're gonna do." Villaraigosa called a third vote, with the same result. Despite not receiving a two-thirds majority, Villaraigosa still declared the amendment passed, causing an eruption of boos on the floor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-dnc-platform-god-jerusalem-20120905,0,558903.story|title=Democrats put God, Jerusalem back in platform over objections|first1=Matea|last1=Gold|first2=Michael|last2=Memoli|date=5 September 2012|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

==Public opinion==
[[Image:Antonio_Villaraigosa.jpg|thumb|right|250px|ACLU event]]
After his election as Los Angeles Mayor, Villaraigosa was featured on the cover of ''[[Newsweek]],'' and in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' 's story on the country's 25 most influential Latinos, but repeated questions concerning his marital infidelity issues appear to have damaged his reputation locally and nationally. His approval rating when he left office was 47%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ktla.com/2013/07/01/poll-villaraigosa-leaves-office-with-47-approval-rating/ |title=Poll: Villaraigosa Leaves Office with 47% Approval Rating}}</ref>

Villaraigosa has also received criticism because of his membership in [[MEChA]] while attending UCLA and his alleged support for [[immigration reform]].<ref>[[#refJK|John and Ken]]</ref><ref>[[#refSFC|San Francisco Chronicle]]</ref> He has also been criticized because of the high frequency in which he holds press conferences, attends photo-ops, and travels out of town (including campaigning for [[Hillary Clinton]]). An ''[[LA Weekly]]'' article by Patrick Range McDonald published on September 11, 2008, presented an analysis of a 10-week period from May 21 to August 1, and determined that "On direct city business—such as signing legislation and meeting with city-department heads—his schedule shows the mayor spent 11 percent of his time...Yet the 11 percent of Villaraigosa's time that the Weekly has identified as being spent in L.A. on actual city work—running, fixing or shaping government policies and actions—reveals that he frequently spends that limited time huddling with special-interest groups who have helped him attain higher office."<ref>[[#refLAWeekly22|LA Weekly, 2008-09-11]]</ref>

A November 4, 2008 election day poll, conducted by the [[Center for the Study of Los Angeles]] at [[Loyola Marymount University]] found that Villaraigosa had a job approval rating of 61%.<ref>[[#refLAWeekly33|LA Weekly, 2009-01-01]]</ref><ref>[[#refKevin|LA Observed, 2008-12-09]]</ref> In 2009, a poll by the Los Angeles times showed his approval rating had slipped to 55%, "relatively low for a sitting Mayor who faced little name opposition in his recent re-election victory."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-06-23/bay-area/17211161_1_villaraigosa-unemployment-rate-los-angeles-mayor |title=L.A. mayor Villaraigosa won't run for governor – SFGate |publisher=Articles.sfgate.com |date=2009-06-23 |accessdate=2010-08-03 | first=Joe | last=Garofoli}}</ref> At the same time, his showing and that of the candidates he supported in the election were lackluster.

Villaraigosa was featured in the editorial cover story of the June, 2009 ''[[Los Angeles (magazine)|Los Angeles]]'' Magazine, which took him to task for a lack of effectiveness regarding many of his stated policy priorities, and a focus on election to higher office, to the detriment of the needs of the City.<ref>[[#refLAMag2|Los Angeles Magazine, June, 2009]]</ref> In response, the ''[[Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'' devoted its June 11 cover story to a defense of Villaraigosa's record.<ref>[[#refJewishJournal|Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, 2009-06-10]]</ref>

After he left the mayor's office, Villaraigosa was involved in Campaign to Fix the Debt, a movement for entitlement reform to cut Social Security and Medicare, which Democratic strategist [[Nathan Ballard]] said is "not just touching the third rail&nbsp;— it's an act of public self-immolation."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.sfchronicle.com/nation/article/Villaraigosa-s-past-fiscal-policies-may-anger-6055602.php | title = Villaraigosa's past fiscal policies may anger Democrats | newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date = 1 February 2015 | accessdate = 11 March 2015 | author = Marinucci, Carla}}</ref>
