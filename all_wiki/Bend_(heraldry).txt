[[File:Azure, a bend Or.svg|thumb|right|150px| ''Azure, a bend or'', possibly the most famous bend in heraldic history, which was the subject of one of the earliest cases in [[law of arms|heraldic law]] in [[England]], [[Scrope v. Grosvenor]] (1389)]]
{{Heraldic achievement}}
In [[heraldry]], a '''bend''' is a band or strap running from the upper [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] (the bearer's right side and the viewer's left) corner of the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] to the lower [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] (the bearer's left side, and the viewer's right).  Authorities differ as to how much of the [[Field (heraldry)|field]] it should cover, ranging from one-fifth (if shown between other [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]s) up to one-third (if charged alone).  The supposed rule that a bend should occupy a maximum of one-third of the field appears to exclude the possibility of three bends being shown together, but contrary examples exist.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Outside heraldry, the term "bend (or bar) sinister" is sometimes used to imply [[illegitimacy]], though it is almost never true that a bend sinister has this significance, and a "bar sinister" cannot, by its nature, exist.

==Variations==
[[File:Arms1stEarlFortescue.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Achievement (heraldry)|Heraldic achievement]] of Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Fortescue, showing arms of Fortescue [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] Grenville. ''Baron: Azure, a bend engrailled argent plain cottised or; Femme: Vert, on a cross argent five [[Roundel|torteaux]]''.{{sfn|Debrett's|1968|p=461}}]] 

A bend can be modified by most of the [[division of the field|lines of partition]], such as the ''bend engrailed'' in the ancient arms of [[Earl Fortescue|Fortescue]] and the ''bend wavy'' in the ancient coat of Wallop, [[Earl of Portsmouth|Earls of Portsmouth]].

===Diminutives===
The '''diminutives'''  of the bend, being narrower versions, are as follows, in descending order of width:
*'''Bendlet''': One-half as wide as a bend, as in the arms of [[Manchester City Council]], England. A ''bendlet couped'' is also known as a '''baton''',{{sfnp|Boutell|1914|p=58}} as in the coat of [[Eliott baronets|Elliot of Stobs]]{{refn|Public Register volume 1, page 144. {{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}}}
*'''Cotise''': One-fourth the width of a bend; it appears only in pairs, one on either side (French: ''coté'') of a bend, in which case the bend is said to be ''cotised'' as in the ancient arms of [[Earl Fortescue|Fortescue]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford|Bohun]] and in the more modern arms of [[Hyndburn Borough Council]], England.
*'''Riband''' or '''ribbon''': Also one-fourth the width of a bend. It is also called a '''cost''' as in the arms of [[Abernethie of Auchincloch]] (''Or, a lion rampant gules surmounted of a cost sable, all within a bordure engrailed azure'' — first and fourth quarters){{refn|Public Register volume 1, page 69 {{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}}}
*'''Scarp''' (or '''scarf'''): a ''bend sinister'' of one-half width.<ref name="Edmonson">{{cite book |last=Edmondson |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Edmondson |title=A Complete Body of Heraldry |date=1780 |page=[https://archive.org/details/completebodyofhe01edmo/page/163 163] |url=https://archive.org/details/completebodyofhe01edmo |via=Internet Archive |ref=harv}}</ref>

[[File:Arms of Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle.svg|thumb|200px|[[Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle]] (d.1542) bore the arms of the [[House of York]] with a bendlet sinister overall.]]

The usual bend is occasionally called a ''bend dexter'' when it needs to contrast with the ''bend [[dexter and sinister|sinister]]'', which runs in the other direction, like a sash worn diagonally from the left shoulder (Latin ''sinister'' means ''left''). The bend sinister and its diminutives such as the [[baton sinister]] are rare as an independent motif; they occur more often as [[marks of distinction]].  The term "bar sinister" is an erroneous term when used in this context, since the "bar" in heraldry refers to a horizontal line.

The bend sinister, reduced in size to that of a ''bendlet'' (narrow) or ''baton'' (ending short of the edge of the shield), was one of the commonest [[brisure]]s (differences) added to the arms of [[illegitimate]] offspring of European aristocratic lords.{{sfnmp|1a1=Woodward|1a2=Burnett|1y=1892|1p=172|2a1=Montagu|2y=1840|2pp=41–42}} Such royal descent was considered a mark of honour,{{sfnp|Bertelli|Litchfield|2003 |pages=174–5 }} and in most of Europe, illegitimate children of nobles, despite having few legal rights, were customarily regarded as noble and married within the most aristocratic families.{{sfnp|Montagu|1840|pages=41–42}}

This was the usual mark used to identify illegitimate descendants of the [[English royal family]] dating from fifteenth century, as in the arms of [[Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle]], illegitimate son of [[Edward IV of England]].{{sfnmp|1a1=Montagu|1y=1840|1pp=41–42|2a1=Bertelli|2a2=Litchfield|2y=2003 |2pp=174–5|3a1=Boutell|3y=1914|3pp=190-1}} The full-sized bend sinister was seldom used in this way, and more recent examples also exist of bends sinister that have no connection with illegitimacy, such as in the arms of the [[Burne-Jones baronets]].{{sfnmp|Fox-Davies|1909|1p=512|O'Shea|1986 |2pp=11–12}} These markings were never subject to strict rules,{{sfnmp|1a1=Fox-Davies|1y=1909|1p=508|2a1=Woodward|2a2=Burnett|2y=1892|2p=553}} and the customary English use of the bend, bendlet, and baton sinister to denote illegitimacy in this way eventually gave way to the use of different kinds of [[bordure]]s.{{sfnp|Boutell|1914|pp=190-1}}

==={{anchor|Bar sinister}} "Bar sinister"===
{{redirect|Bar Sinister|the Underdog character|Simon Bar Sinister}}

[[Sir Walter Scott]] is credited with inventing the phrase ''bar sinister'', which has become a [[metonymy|metonym]]ic term for [[bastardy]].{{sfnmp|Wilson|2005 |1p=56|Freeman|2009|2p=29}} Heraldry scholar [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] and others state that the phrase derives from a misspelling of ''barre'', the French term for ''bend''.{{sfnmp |1a1=Woodward |1a2=Burnett |1y=1892 |1p=172 |2a1=O'Shea |2y=1986|2pp=11–12|3a1=Fox-Davies|3y=1909|3p=508}} Despite its not being a real heraldic symbol (a bar cannot actually be either ''dexter'' or ''sinister'' since it is horizontal), ''bar sinister'' has become a standard euphemism for illegitimate birth.{{sfnmp|Wilson|2005 |1p=56|Hogarth|Pine|2017}}

The phrase '''in bend''' refers to the appearance of several items on the shield being lined up in the direction of a bend, as in the arms of the ancient [[Earl of Iddesleigh|Northcote family]] of Devon: ''Argent, three [[Cross|crosses-crosslet]] in bend sable''.{{sfn|Debrett's|1968|p=604}} It is also used when something is slanted in the direction of a bend, as in the coat of [[Surrey County Council]] in England.{{sfn|Weald and Downs|n.d.}}

===Bendwise===
A [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] '''bendwise'''  is slanted like a bend.  When a charge is placed on a bend, by default it is shown bendwise.

===Party per bend===
[[File:Party per bend demo.svg|thumb|100px|''Party per bend, argent and gules'']]

A shield '''party per bend''' (or simply ''per bend'') is [[Division of the field|divided]] into two parts by a single line which runs in the direction of a bend. Applies not only to the fields of shields but also to charges.

===Bendy===
[[File:Blason Ducs Bourgogne (ancien).svg|thumb|right|120px|Arms of the first [[house of Burgundy]]: ''Bendy or and azure, a bordure gules'']]
'''Bendy''' is a [[variation of the field]] consisting (usually) of an even number of parts,{{sfnp|Boutell|1914|p=59}} most often six; as in the coat of the [[duke of Burgundy|duchy of Burgundy]].

Analogous terms are derived from the bend sinister: ''per bend sinister'', ''bendwise sinister'', ''bendy sinister''.

===Engouled===
In [[Spanish heraldry]], bends may be ''engouled'', or swallowed, by the heads of dragons or wolves. A famous example of this is in the [[Royal Bend of Castile]].
