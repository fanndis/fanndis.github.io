In the early 1970s, Lauper performed as a vocalist with various [[cover band]]s. One, called Doc West, covered disco songs as well as [[Janis Joplin]]. A later band, Flyer, was active in the New York metropolitan area, singing hits by bands including [[Bad Company]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Led Zeppelin]].

===1980–1982: Blue Angel===
{{Main|Blue Angel (band)|l1=Blue Angel}}
In 1978, Lauper met saxophone player [[John Turi]] through her manager Ted Rosenblatt. Turi and Lauper formed a band named Blue Angel and recorded a demo tape of original music. [[Steven Massarsky|Steve Massarsky]], manager of [[The Allman Brothers Band]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Porter|title=Steve Massarsky: Starting small with BIG |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/CAREER/jobenvy/09/29/steve.massarsky/|website=cnn.com|publisher=Cable News Network|access-date=September 24, 2014}}</ref> heard the tape and liked Lauper's voice.

Lauper received recording offers as a solo artist, but held out, wanting the band to be included in any deal she made. Blue Angel was eventually signed by [[Polydor Records]] and released a [[Blue Angel (Blue Angel album)|self-titled album]] on the label in 1980. Lauper hated the album cover, saying that it made her look like [[Big Bird]], but ''Rolling Stone'' magazine later included it as one of the 100 best [[New wave music|new wave]] album covers (2003). Despite critical acclaim, the album sold poorly ("It went lead", as Lauper later joked) and the band broke up. The members of Blue Angel had a falling-out with Massarsky and fired him as their manager. He later filed an $80,000 suit against them, which forced Lauper into bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/lauper_cyndi/artist.jhtml|title=Cyndi Lauper|publisher=MTV|access-date=March 1, 2010}}</ref> After this Lauper temporarily lost her voice due to an inverted cyst in her vocal cord.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news|first=David|last=Chiu |url=http://time.com/65952/cyndi-lauper-shes-so-unusual/ |title=Cyndi Lauper's She's So Unusual Is 30: New Tour With Cher, Kinky Boots |work=TIME |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref>

After Blue Angel broke up, Lauper spent time, due to her financial problems, working in retail stores, waitressing at [[IHOP]] (which she quit after being demoted to hostess when the manager sexually harassed her),<ref name="WETV"/> and singing in local clubs. Her most frequent gigs were at El Sombrero.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Music critics who saw Lauper perform with Blue Angel believed she had star potential due to her four-octave singing range.<ref name="auto1"/> In 1981, while singing in a local New York bar, Lauper met David Wolff, who took over as her manager and had her sign a recording contract with [[Portrait Records]], a subsidiary of [[Epic Records]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Cyndi Lauper |url=http://www.lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-cyndi-lauper |website=Lifetime.co.uk/ |publisher=AETN UK |access-date=September 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904201602/http://www.lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-cyndi-lauper |archive-date=September 4, 2014  }}</ref>

===1983–1985: ''She's So Unusual''===
{{Main|She's So Unusual}}
[[File:Cyndi Lauper 1985.jpg|thumb|upright|Lauper in 1985]]
On October 14, 1983, Lauper released her first solo album, ''[[She's So Unusual]]''. The album became a worldwide hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;4 in the U.S. and reaching the top five in eight other countries. The primary studio musicians were [[Eric Bazilian]] and [[Rob Hyman]] (of [[The Hooters]]), [[Rick Chertoff]], [[Richard Termini]] and Peter Wood. Lauper became popular with teenagers and critics, in part due to her hybrid punk image, which was crafted by stylist Patrick Lucas.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://articles.latimes.com/1985-02-08/news/vw-4846_1_freckles-show |title=Capturing Head-to-Toe Look of the '80s |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=February 8, 1985 |access-date=October 15, 2011 |first=Mary|last=Rourke}}</ref>

{{listen |pos=left|filename=Cyndi Lauper - Girls Just Want To Have Fun.ogg|title="Girls Just Want To Have Fun".|Type=single}}
Lauper co-wrote four songs on ''She's So Unusual'', including the hits "Time After Time" and "She Bop".  On the songs she did not write, Lauper sometimes changed the lyrics. Such is the case with "[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]". Lauper found the original lyrics to be misogynistic, so she rewrote the song as an anthem for young women.<ref>{{cite news |first=Priya |last=Elan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/27/popandrock |title=Music: Priya Elan pays tribute to the man who wrote Girls Just Want To Have Fun |newspaper=The Guardian |date=September 27, 2008 |access-date=October 15, 2011 |location=London}}</ref>

The album's second single, "[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]", co-written by Lauper and Rob Hyman, hit No.&nbsp;1 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and Adult Contemporary charts. The song would earn Lauper an [[Music recording sales certification|RIAA Gold certification]] for record sales that reached 500,000 copies, and was later covered by Miles Davis on his album ''[[You're Under Arrest (Miles Davis album)|You're Under Arrest]]''. It became a staple of Davis's live shows at the time, featuring on the live album ''[[Live Around the World (Miles Davis album)|Live Around the World]]''.

The other [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles on ''She's So Unusual'' were "[[She Bop]]" (No.&nbsp;3), "[[All Through the Night (Cyndi Lauper song)|All Through the Night]]" (No.&nbsp;5), written by [[Jules Shear]], and "[[Money Changes Everything]]" (No.27).

The album includes five cover songs, including [[The Brains]]' new wave track "[[Money Changes Everything]]" (No. 27 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100) and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[When You Were Mine (Prince song)|When You Were Mine]]". The album made Lauper the first female artist to have four consecutive ''Billboard'' Hot 100 top five hits from one album. The LP stayed in the Top 200 charts for more than 65 weeks, and since has sold 16 million copies worldwide.<ref name="SSU Sales">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article4429585.ece |title=Cyndi Lauper is back, and the girl still wants to have fun – Times Online|website=Entertainment.TimesOnline.co.uk |access-date=September 15, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205025752/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article4429585.ece|archive-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref><ref name="SSU SalesII">{{cite news |first=George|last=Varga |title=Cyndi Lauper still proudly 'unusual'|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/Jun/07/cyndi-lauper-still-proudly-unusual/ |newspaper=[[U-T San Diego]] |date=June 7, 2013 |access-date=August 2, 2014}}</ref>

The song "Say a Prayer" was written for a friend of hers who had died from AIDS. "Unhook the Stars" was used in the [[Unhook the Stars|movie of the same name]].

Lauper has been an LGBT rights supporter throughout her career, campaigning for equality through various charities and [[gay pride]] events around the world. Lauper stated that she became involved in gay rights advocacy because her sister Ellen is a lesbian and because Lauper herself was passionate about equality. Lauper cites her sister Ellen as a role model.<ref name=voice>{{cite web|url=http://thegavoice.com/cyndi-laupers-true-colors/|title=Cyndi Lauper's 'True Colors'|publisher=GA Voice|access-date=January 23, 2016|date=July 23, 2010}}</ref>

Her song "Above the Clouds" celebrates the memory of [[Matthew Shepard]], a young gay man beaten to death in [[Wyoming]]. As a member of the [[Matthew Shepard Foundation]] Board, Lauper devoted a [[concert tour]] in 2005 to promoting the Foundation's message.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/entertainment-news/2005/12/14/cyndi-lauper-joins-honorary-board-matthew-shepard|title=Cyndi Lauper joins honorary board of Matthew Shepard Foundation|publisher=The Advocate|access-date=January 23, 2016|date=December 14, 2005}}</ref>

The 30-bed facility offers temporary shelter and job placement help.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/cyndi-lauper-opens-shelter-for-homeless-lgbt-youth-20110825|title=Cyndi Lauper Opens Shelter for Homeless LGBT Youth |website=Rollingstone.com |date=August 25, 2011 |access-date=August 28, 2015 |first=Inae |last=Oh}}</ref>
