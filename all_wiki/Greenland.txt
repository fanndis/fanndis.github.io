The Norse colonies disappeared in the late 15th&nbsp;century when Norway was hit by the [[Black Death]] and entered a severe decline. Soon after their demise, beginning in 1499, the Portuguese briefly explored and claimed the island, naming it ''Terra do Lavrador'' (later applied to [[Labrador]] in Canada).<ref>[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/portuguese.php The Portuguese Explorers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508193835/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/portuguese.php |date=8 May 2016 }}.

In the early 17th century, Danish explorers reached Greenland again. To strengthen trading and power, [[Denmark–Norway]] affirmed sovereignty over the island. Because of Norway's weak status, it lost sovereignty over Greenland in 1814 when the union was dissolved. Greenland became Danish in 1814 and was fully integrated in [[Denmark]] in 1953 organised in the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish constitution]]. With the Constitution of 1953, the people in Greenland became [[Danish nationality law|citizens of Denmark]]. From 1961 Greenland joined the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), which [[Denmark]] joined as a founding member of the EFTA in 1960, but its membership ceased with effect from 1973 when [[Denmark]] joined the [[European Communities]]. In 1973, Greenland joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) with Denmark. However, in a [[1982 Greenlandic European Communities membership referendum|referendum]] in 1982, a majority of the population voted for Greenland to withdraw from the EEC. This was effected in 1985, changing Greenland to an OCT ([[Overseas Countries and Territories]]) associated with the EEC, now the [[European Union]] (EU).  The associated relationship with the EU also means that all [[Greenlanders|Greenlandic]] [[Danish nationality law|nationals]] (OCT-nationals) are [[EU citizens]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES (OCTS) |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/overseas_countries_and_territories.html |access-date=2020-09-14 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |format=Website}}</ref> 

Greenland contains the world's largest and most northerly [[national park]], [[Northeast Greenland National Park]] (''Kalaallit Nunaanni nuna eqqissisimatitaq''). Established in 1974 and expanded to its present size in 1988, it protects {{convert|972001|km2|}} of the interior and northeastern coast of Greenland and is bigger than all but twenty-nine countries in the world.

In [[1979 Greenlandic home rule referendum|1979]], Denmark granted [[home rule]] to Greenland; in 2008, Greenlanders [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|voted]] in favour of the Self-Government Act, which transferred more power from the Danish government to the local [[Naalakkersuisut|Greenlandic government]].<ref name="Greenland In Figures 2012">{{Cite book |url=http://www.stat.gl/publ/en/GF/2012/content/Greenland%20in%20Figures%202012.pdf |title=Greenland in Figures 2012 |work=Greenland in Figures |publisher=stat.gl |isbn=978-87-986787-6-2 |issn=1602-5709 |access-date=10 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113160436/http://www.stat.gl/publ/en/GF/2012/content/Greenland%20in%20Figures%202012.pdf |archive-date=13 November 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Under the new structure, Greenland has gradually assumed responsibility for policing, the judicial system, company law, accounting, auditing, mineral resource activities, aviation, law of legal capacity, family law and succession law, aliens and border controls, the working environment, and financial regulation and supervision. The Danish government still retains control of monetary policy and foreign affairs including defence. It also provided an initial annual subsidy of [[Danish krone|DKK]] 3.4&nbsp;billion, and to diminish gradually over time. Greenland expects to grow its economy based on increased income from the extraction of natural resources. The capital, Nuuk, held the [[2016 Arctic Winter Games]]. At 70%, Greenland has one of the highest shares of renewable energy in the world, mostly coming from [[hydropower]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nordic Investment Bank |title=Hydropower creates clean energy and jobs in Greenland |url=http://www.nib.int/news_publications/cases_and_feature_stories/223/hydropower_creates_clean_energy_and_jobs_in_greenland |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103120028/http://www.nib.int/news_publications/cases_and_feature_stories/223/hydropower_creates_clean_energy_and_jobs_in_greenland |archive-date=3 November 2016 |access-date=2 October 2016 |website=NIB |publisher=Nordic Investment Bank}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The early Norse settlers named the island as ''Greenland.'' In the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic sagas]], the Norwegian-born Icelander [[Erik the Red]] was said to be exiled from Iceland for manslaughter. Along with his extended family and his [[thrall]]s (i.e. slaves or serfs), he set out in ships to explore an icy land known to lie to the northwest. After finding a habitable area and settling there, he named it ''{{lang|non|{{linktext|Grœnland}}}}'' (translated as "Greenland"), supposedly in the hope that the pleasant name would attract settlers.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17946/17946-h/17946-h.htm |title=Eirik the Red's Saga |date=8 March 2006 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |access-date=6 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511061916/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17946/17946-h/17946-h.htm |archive-date=11 May 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="ancientstandard">[http://ancientstandard.com/2010/12/17/how-greenland-got-its-name/ "How Greenland got its name"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319050912/http://ancientstandard.com/2010/12/17/how-greenland-got-its-name/ |date=19 March 2012 }}.

===Early Paleo-Inuit cultures===
[[File:Arctic cultures 900-1500.png|upright|thumb|Maps showing the different cultures in Greenland, Labrador, Newfoundland and the Canadian Arctic islands in the years 900, 1100, 1300 and 1500. Green: [[Dorset Culture]]; blue: [[Thule Culture]]; red: [[Norsemen|Norse culture]]; yellow: [[Innu]]; orange: [[Beothuk]]]]

In prehistoric times, Greenland was home to several successive [[Paleo-Inuit]] cultures known today primarily through archaeological finds. The earliest entry of the Paleo-Inuit into Greenland is thought to have occurred about 2500&nbsp;BC. From around 2500&nbsp;BC to 800&nbsp;BC, southern and western Greenland were inhabited by the [[Saqqaq culture]].

===Norse settlement===
[[File:Runesten fra Kingittorsuaq.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kingittorsuaq Runestone]] from [[Kingittorsuaq Island]] ([[Middle Ages]])]]
From 986, Greenland's west coast was settled by [[Icelanders]] and [[Norwegians]], through a contingent of 14 boats led by Erik the Red. They formed three settlements – known as the [[Eastern Settlement]], the [[Western Settlement]] and the [[Ivittuut|Middle Settlement]] – on fjords near the southwesternmost tip of the island.<ref name=Brown2000 /><ref>Kudeba, N. (19 April 2014). "Chapter 5 – Norse Explorers from Erik the Red to Leif Erikson", in ''Canadian Explorers.''</ref> They shared the island with the late Dorset culture inhabitants who occupied the northern and western parts, and later with the Thule culture that entered from the north. Norse Greenlanders submitted to Norwegian rule in 1261 under the [[Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)|Kingdom of Norway]]. Later the Kingdom of Norway entered into a personal union with Denmark in 1380 and from 1397 was a part of the [[Kalmar Union]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Boraas |first=Tracey |url=https://archive.org/details/sweden0000bora/page/24 |title=Sweden |publisher=Capstone Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7368-0939-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/sweden0000bora/page/24 24]}}</ref>

Theories drawn from archeological excavations at [[Herjolfsnes]] in the 1920s suggest that the condition of human bones from this period indicates that the Norse population was malnourished, possibly because of [[Erosion|soil erosion]] resulting from the Norsemen's destruction of natural vegetation in the course of farming, turf-cutting, and wood-cutting.

Other theories about the disappearance of the Norse settlement have been proposed;

===Thule culture (1300–present)===
[[File:Billeder fra Grønland 11441.tif|thumb|Pictures of Greenland, {{circa|1863}}]]
The Thule people are the ancestors of the current Greenlandic population. No genes from the Paleo-Inuit have been found in the present population of Greenland.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/canada/story/1.2749691 "Inuit were not the first people to settle in the Arctic"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109101343/http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/canada/story/1.2749691 |date=9 November 2014 }}, CBC News (Canada), 28 August 2014</ref> The Thule culture migrated eastward from what is now known as Alaska around 1000 AD, reaching Greenland around 1300. The Thule culture was the first to introduce to Greenland such technological innovations as [[dog sled]]s and [[toggling harpoon]]s.

===1500–1814===
In 1500, King [[Manuel&nbsp;I of Portugal]] sent [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] to Greenland in search of a [[Northwest Passage]] to Asia which, according to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], was part of Portugal's sphere of influence. In 1501, Corte-Real returned with his brother, [[Miguel Corte-Real]]. Finding the sea frozen, they headed south and arrived in [[Labrador]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Upon the brothers' return to Portugal, the cartographic information supplied by Corte-Real was incorporated into a new map of the world which was presented to [[Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Ercole I d'Este]], [[Duke of Ferrara and of Modena|Duke of Ferrara]], by Alberto Cantino in 1502. The [[Cantino planisphere|''Cantino'' planisphere]], made in Lisbon, accurately depicts the southern coastline of Greenland.<ref>Nebenzahl, Kenneth.

In 1605–1607, King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] sent a [[Christian IV's expeditions to Greenland|series of expeditions]] to Greenland and Arctic waterways to locate the lost eastern Norse settlement and assert Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The expeditions were mostly unsuccessful, partly due to leaders who lacked experience with the difficult arctic ice and weather conditions, and partly because the expedition leaders were given instructions to search for the Eastern Settlement on the east coast of Greenland just north of [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]], which is almost inaccessible due to southward [[Drift ice|drifting ice]]. The pilot on all three trips was English explorer [[James Hall (explorer)|James Hall]].

[[File:Legende børn, ca. 1878 (8473597948).jpg|thumb|[[Nuuk|Godthåb]] in Greenland, {{circa|1878}}]]
After the Norse settlements died off, Greenland came under the de&nbsp;facto control of various Inuit groups, but the Danish government never forgot or relinquished the claims to Greenland that it had inherited from the Norse. When it re-established contact with Greenland in the early 17th&nbsp;century, Denmark asserted its sovereignty over the island. In 1721, a joint mercantile and clerical expedition led by Danish-Norwegian missionary [[Hans Egede]] was sent to Greenland, not knowing whether a Norse civilization remained there. This expedition is part of the Dano-Norwegian colonization of the Americas. After 15&nbsp;years in Greenland, Hans Egede left his son [[Paul Egede]] in charge of the mission there and returned to Denmark, where he established a Greenland Seminary. This new colony was centred at [[Nuuk|Godthåb]] ("Good Hope") on the southwest coast. Gradually, Greenland was opened up to Danish merchants, and closed to those from other countries.

===Treaty of Kiel to World War II===

When the union between the crowns of Denmark and Norway was dissolved in 1814, the [[Treaty of Kiel]] severed Norway's former colonies and left them under the control of the Danish monarch. Norway occupied then-uninhabited eastern Greenland as [[Erik the Red's Land]] in July 1931, claiming that it constituted ''[[terra nullius]]''. Norway and Denmark agreed to submit the matter in 1933 to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], which decided against Norway.<ref>[http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie_AB/AB_53/01_Groenland_Oriental_Arret.pdf ''Legal Status of Eastern Greenland''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511135249/http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie_AB/AB_53/01_Groenland_Oriental_Arret.pdf |date=11 May 2011 }}, PCIJ Series A/B No. 53 (1933)</ref>

Greenland's connection to Denmark was severed on 9 April 1940, early in [[History of Greenland during World War II|World War&nbsp;II]], after Denmark was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. On 8 April 1941, the United States occupied Greenland to defend it against a possible invasion by Germany.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Doenecke |first=Justus D. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bhnf0fxI260C&pg=PA331 |title=In Danger Undaunted: The Anti-Interventionist Movement of 1940–1941 |date=8 July 1941 |publisher=Hoover Press |isbn=978-0-8179-8841-8}}</ref> The United States occupation of Greenland continued until 1945. Greenland was able to buy goods from the United States and Canada by selling [[cryolite]] from the mine at [[Ivittuut]]. The major air bases were [[Bluie West-1]] at [[Narsarsuaq Airport|Narsarsuaq]] and [[Bluie West-8]] at [[Kangerlussuaq Airport|Søndre Strømfjord]] (Kangerlussuaq), both of which are still used as Greenland's major international airports. [[Bluie]] was the military code name for Greenland.

During this war, the system of government changed: [[List of governors of Greenland|Governor]] [[Eske Brun]] ruled the island under a law of 1925 that allowed governors to take control under extreme circumstances; Governor Aksel Svane was transferred to the United States to lead the commission to supply Greenland. The Danish [[Slædepatruljen Sirius|Sirius Patrol]] guarded the northeastern shores of Greenland in 1942 using dogsleds. They detected several German [[weather station]]s and alerted American troops, who destroyed the facilities. After the collapse of the Third Reich, [[Albert Speer]] briefly considered escaping in a small aeroplane to hide out in Greenland, but changed his mind and decided to surrender to the [[United States Armed Forces]].<ref>[[Albert Speer|Speer, Albert]]. ''Inside the Third Reich,'' 1971</ref>

Greenland had been a protected and very isolated society until 1940. The [[Politics of Denmark|Danish government]] had maintained a strict monopoly of [[Economy of Greenland|Greenlandic trade]], allowing only small scale [[troaking]] with Scottish whalers. In wartime Greenland developed a sense of self-reliance through self-government and independent communication with the outside world. Despite this change, in 1946 a commission including the highest Greenlandic council, the [[:da:Grønlands Landsråd|Landsrådene]], recommended patience and no radical reform of the system. Two years later, the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established. A final report (G-50) was presented in 1950: Greenland was to be a modern [[welfare state]] with Denmark as sponsor and example. In 1953, Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom. Home rule was granted in 1979.

With the 1953 Danish constitution, Greenland's colonial status ended as the island was incorporated into the Danish realm as an [[amt (country subdivision)|amt]] (county). Danish citizenship was extended to Greenlanders. Danish policies toward Greenland consisted of a strategy of cultural assimilation – or de-Greenlandification. During this period, the Danish government promoted the exclusive use of the Danish language in official matters, and required Greenlanders to go to Denmark for their post-secondary education. Many Greenlandic children grew up in boarding schools in southern Denmark, and a number lost their cultural ties to Greenland. While the policies "succeeded" in the sense of shifting Greenlanders from being primarily subsistence hunters into being urbanized wage earners, the Greenlandic elite began to reassert a Greenlandic cultural identity. A movement developed in favour of independence, reaching its peak in the 1970s.<ref>Loukacheva, Natalia (2007).

At least four scientific expedition stations and camps had been established on the ice sheet in the ice-covered central part of Greenland (indicated as pale blue in the adjacent map): [[Eismitte]], [[North Ice]], North GRIP Camp and The Raven Skiway. There is a year-round station [[Summit Camp]] on the ice sheet, established in 1989. The radio station [[Jørgen Brønlund Fjord]] was, until 1950, the northernmost permanent outpost in the world.

[[File:Greenland-musk-ox hg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Muskox]]en in Greenland]]

There are approximately 700 known species of insects in Greenland, which is low compared with other countries (over one million species have been described worldwide). The sea is rich in fish and invertebrates, especially in the milder [[West Greenland Current]]; a large part of the Greenland fauna is associated with marine-based food chains, including large colonies of seabirds. The few native land mammals in Greenland include the [[polar bear]], [[Reindeer hunting in Greenland#Three subspecies in Greenland|reindeer]] (introduced by Europeans), [[arctic fox]], [[arctic hare]], [[musk ox]], [[Northern collared lemming|collared lemming]], [[ermine]], and [[arctic wolf]]. The last four are found naturally only in [[East Greenland]], having immigrated from [[Ellesmere Island]]. There are dozens of species of [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[whale]]s along the coast. Land fauna consists predominantly of animals which have spread from North America or, in the case of many birds and insects, from Europe. There are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island.<ref name="wildlife">{{Cite web |year=2014 |title=Greenland Wildlife |url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Natur_og_miljø/Zoologi/Dyreliv:_Danmark,_Færøerne,_Grønland/Grønland_(Dyreliv) |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313204254/http://denstoredanske.dk/Natur_og_milj%C3%B8/Zoologi/Dyreliv:_Danmark,_F%C3%A6r%C3%B8erne,_Gr%C3%B8nland/Gr%C3%B8nland_(Dyreliv) |archive-date=13 March 2016 |access-date=8 October 2015 |website=Redaction |publisher=The Great Danish Encyclopedia}}</ref>

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Greenland belongs to the Arctic province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. The island is sparsely populated in vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland and small shrubs, which are regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Greenland is the European white birch (''[[Betula pubescens]]'') along with gray-leaf willow (''[[Salix glauca]]''), rowan (''[[Sorbus aucuparia]]''), common juniper (''[[Juniperus communis]]'') and other smaller trees, mainly willows.

Greenland's flora consists of about 500 species of "higher" plants, i.e. [[flowering plant]]s, [[fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s and [[lycopodiophyta]]. Of the other groups, the [[lichen]]s are the most diverse, with about 950 species; there are 600–700 species of fungi; [[moss]]es and [[bryophyte]]s are also found. Most of Greenland's higher plants have [[wikt:Special:Search/circumpolar|circumpolar]] or [[circumboreal]] distributions; only a dozen species of [[saxifrage]] and [[hawkweed]] are [[endemic]]. A few plant species were introduced by the Norsemen, such as [[Vicia cracca|cow vetch]].

===Political system===
The party system is dominated by the social-democratic [[Forward (Greenland)|Forward]] Party, and the democratic socialist [[Inuit Community]] Party, both of which broadly argue for greater independence from Denmark. While the [[2009 Greenlandic parliamentary election|2009 election]] saw the unionist [[Democrats (Greenland)|Democrat]] Party (two&nbsp;MPs) decline greatly, the [[2013 Greenlandic parliamentary election|2013 election]] consolidated the power of the two main parties at the expense of the smaller groups, and saw the [[Eco-socialism|eco-socialist]] [[Inuit Party]] elected to the [[Parliament of Greenland|Parliament]] for the first time. The dominance of the Forward and Inuit Community parties began to wane after the snap [[2014 Greenlandic general election|2014]] and [[2018 Greenlandic general election|2018]] elections.

The non-binding [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|2008 referendum on self-governance]] favoured increased self-governance by 21,355 votes to 6,663.

In 1985, [[Greenland–European Union relations|Greenland left the European Economic Community]] (EEC), unlike Denmark, which remains a member. The EEC later became the [[European Union]] (EU, renamed and expanded in scope in 1992). Greenland retains some ties through its associated relationship with the EU. However, EU law largely does not apply to Greenland except in the area of trade. Greenland is designated as a member of the [[Special member state territories and the European Union|Overseas Countries and Territories]] (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the [[European Union]], though Greenland can and does receive support from the [[European Development Fund]], [[Multiannual Financial Framework]], [[European Investment Bank]] and EU Programs.<ref name="euprofile">{{Cite web |title=EU Relations with Greenland |url=http://www.eeas.europa.eu/greenland/index_en.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609050531/http://eeas.europa.eu/greenland/index_en.htm |archive-date=9 June 2011 |access-date=3 October 2020 |publisher=European Union}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) |url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/development/overseas_countries_territories/index_en.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813192112/http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/development/overseas_countries_territories/index_en.htm |archive-date=13 August 2011 |access-date=3 October 2020 |publisher=European Union}}</ref>

===Government===
{{Main|Politics of Greenland}}
[[File:Greenland-municipalities-2018.svg|thumb|upright|Municipalities of Greenland]]

Greenland's [[head of state]] is Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]]. The Queen's [[politics of Denmark|government in Denmark]] appoints a [[List of Danish High Commissioners in Greenland|high commissioner]] (''Rigsombudsmand'') to represent it on the island. The commissioner is [[Mikaela Engell]].

Greenlanders elect two representatives to the [[Folketing]], Denmark's parliament, out of a total of 179. The current representatives are [[Aleqa Hammond]] of the [[Siumut]] Party and [[Aaja Chemnitz Larsen]] of the [[Inuit Community]] Party.<ref>[http://www.ft.dk/ Folketinget – Folketinget.dk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628025221/http://www.ft.dk/ |date=28 June 2015 }}. Ft.dk. Retrieved on 21 June 2016.</ref>

Greenland also has its own [[Parliament of Greenland|Parliament]], which has 31&nbsp;members. The government is the [[Naalakkersuisut]] whose members are appointed by the premier. The [[head of government]] is the [[List of Premiers of Greenland|premier]], usually the leader of the majority party in Parliament. The premier is [[Kim Kielsen]] of the [[Siumut]] party.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Greenland}}

Formerly consisting of three counties comprising a total of 18 municipalities, Greenland abolished these in 2009 and has since been divided into large territories known as "municipalities" ({{lang-kl|kommuneqarfiit}}, {{lang-da|kommuner}}): ''[[Sermersooq]]'' ("Much Ice") around the capital [[Nuuk]] and also including all [[Tunu|East Coast]] communities; ''[[Kujalleq]]'' ("South") around [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]]; ''[[Qeqqata]]'' ("Centre") north of the capital along the [[Davis Strait]]; ''[[Qeqertalik]]'' ("The one with islands") surrounding [[Disko Bay]]; and ''[[Avannaata]]'' ("Northern") in the northwest; the latter two having come into being as a result of the [[Qaasuitsup]] municipality, one of the original four, being partitioned in 2018. The northeast of the island composes the unincorporated ''[[Northeast Greenland National Park]]''. ''[[Thule Air Base]]'' is also unincorporated, an enclave within Avannaata municipality administered by the [[United States Air Force]]. During its construction, there were as many as 12,000 American residents but in recent years the number has been below 1,000.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Greenland}}
[[File:Greenland Exports Treemap 2017.svg|thumb|Graphical depiction of Greenland's product exports in 28 colour-coded categories]]
The Greenlandic economy is highly dependent on fishing.

Greenland is abundant in minerals.<ref name=":0" /> Mining of [[ruby]] deposits began in 2007. Other mineral prospects are improving as prices are increasing. These include iron, [[uranium]], aluminium, nickel, [[platinum]], [[tungsten]], [[titanium]], and [[copper]]. Despite resumption{{when|date=January 2014}} of several [[hydrocarbon]] and mineral exploration activities, it will take several years before hydrocarbon production can materialize. The state oil company [[Nunaoil]] was created to help develop the hydrocarbon industry in Greenland. The state company Nunamineral has been launched on the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]] to raise more capital to increase the production of gold, started in 2007.

Electricity has traditionally been generated by oil or diesel power plants, even if there is a large surplus of potential [[hydropower]]. There is a programme to build hydro power plants. The first, and still the largest, is [[Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant]].

There are also plans to build a large aluminium smelter, using hydropower to create an exportable product. It is expected that much of the labour needed will be imported.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=12 October 2011 |title=Greenland's red hot labour market |url=http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/i-fokus/in-focus-2011/boom-for-nordic-mining-industry/article.2011-10-12.8124853746 |url-status=live |journal=[[Nordic Labour Journal]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201145836/http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/i-fokus/in-focus-2011/boom-for-nordic-mining-industry/article.2011-10-12.8124853746 |archive-date=1 February 2013 |access-date=10 February 2013}}</ref>

The [[European Union]] has urged Greenland to restrict People's Republic of China development of [[rare-earth]] projects, as China accounts for 95% of the world's current supply. In early 2013, the Greenland government said that it had no plans to impose such restrictions.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-02-10/chinese-workers-in-greenland ''Chinese Workers—in Greenland?''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213141927/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-02-10/chinese-workers-in-greenland |date=13 February 2013 }} 10 February 2013 ''[[BusinessWeek]]''.</ref>

The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in Greenland's economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the Danish government, an important supplement to the gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic product per capita is equivalent to that of the average economies of Europe.

Greenland suffered an economic contraction in the early 1990s. But, since 1993, the economy has improved. The Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since the late 1980s, which has helped create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign-trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and [[zinc]] mine that year. In 2017, new sources of [[ruby]] in Greenland have been discovered, promising to bring new industry and a new export from the country.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Greenland Rubies: What We Know At This Point {{!}} National Jeweler |url=https://www.nationaljeweler.com/blog/5818-greenland-rubies-what-we-know-at-this-point |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817153630/https://www.nationaljeweler.com/blog/5818-greenland-rubies-what-we-know-at-this-point |archive-date=17 August 2019 |access-date=2019-08-17 |website=www.nationaljeweler.com}}</ref> (See [[Gemstone industry in Greenland]]).

There is air transport both within Greenland and between the island and other nations. There is also scheduled boat traffic, but the long distances lead to long travel times and low frequency. There are virtually no roads between cities because the coast has many fjords that would require ferry service to connect a road network. The only exception is a gravel road of {{convert|3|mi|km|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} length between [[Kangilinnguit]] and the now abandoned former [[cryolite]] mining town of [[Ivittuut]].<ref name="iExplore">{{Cite web |title=Greenland – Transportation |url=https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/north-america/greenland/transportation |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010134859/https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/north-america/greenland/transportation |archive-date=10 October 2018 |access-date=10 October 2018 |website=www.iexplore.com}}</ref> In addition, the lack of agriculture, forestry and similar countryside activities has meant that very few country roads have been built.

There are a total of 13 registered civil airports and 47 helipads in Greenland; most of them are unpaved and located in rural areas. The second longest runway is at Narsarsuaq, a domestic airport with limited international service in south Greenland.

All civil aviation matters are handled by the [[Danish Transport Authority]].

Greenland has a population of 56,081 (January 2020 Estimate).<ref name="population" /> In terms of country of birth, the population is estimated to be of 89.7% [[Greenlanders|Greenlandic]] ([[Inuit]] including [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]-[[Inuit]] [[multi-ethnic]]), 7.8% [[Danish people in Greenland|Danish]], 1.1% [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] and 1.4% other. The multi-ethnic population of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]-[[Inuit]] represent people of [[Danish people in Greenland|Danish]], [[Faroese people|Faroese]], [[Icelandic people|Icelandic]], [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]] ([[Whaling in the Netherlands#17th century|whalers]]), [[German people|German]] ([[Herrnhuters]]), [[Czechs|Czech]] ([[Jednota bratrská]]) descent and others. 

The [[Inuit]] are indigenous to the Arctic and have traditionally inhabited Greenland, as well as areas in [[Canada]] and in [[Alaska]] in the [[United States]]. 
A 2015 wide genetic study of Greenlanders found modern-day Inuit in Greenland are direct descendants of the first Inuit pioneers of the [[Thule people|Thule culture]] with ∼25% admixture of the European colonizers from the 16th century. Despite previous speculations, no evidence of Viking settlers predecessors has been found.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Moltke |first=Ida |last2=Fumagalli |first2=Matteo |last3=Korneliussen |first3=Thorfinn |date=2015 |title=Uncovering the Genetic History of the Present-Day Greenlandic Population |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=54–69 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.11.012 |pmc=4289681 |pmid=25557782}}</ref> The majority of the population is [[Church of Denmark|Lutheran]].

===Languages===
[[File:Parkverbot Grönland.jpg|thumb|A bilingual sign in Nuuk, displaying the Danish and Kalaallisut for "Parking forbidden for all vehicles"]]

Both [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] (an [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] language) and [[Danish language|Danish]] have been used in public affairs since the establishment of home rule in 1979; the majority of the population can speak both languages.

Debate about the roles of Greenlandic and Danish in the country's future is ongoing. The orthography of Greenlandic was established in 1851<ref>Kleinschmidt, Samuel 1968 (1851): Grammatik der grønlændischen Sprache : mit teilweisem Einschluss des Labradordialekts. Hildesheim : Olms, 1968.</ref> and [[Kalaallisut orthography|revised]] in 1973. The country has a 100% literacy rate.<ref name="cia-factbook">{{Cite web |title=Greenland |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gl.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013230050/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gl.html |archive-date=13 October 2013 |access-date=15 May 2007 |website=[[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]}}</ref>

A majority of the population speaks Greenlandic, most of them bilingually. It is spoken by about 50,000 people, making it the most populous of the Eskimo–Aleut language family, spoken by more people than all the other languages of the family combined.

Kalaallisut is the Greenlandic dialect of West Greenland, which has long been the most populous area of the island. This has led to its de&nbsp;facto status as the official "Greenlandic" language, although the northern dialect [[Inuktun]] remains spoken by 1,000 or so people around [[Qaanaaq]], and the eastern dialect [[Tunumiit dialect|Tunumiisut]] by around 3,000.<ref>Mennecier, Philippe (1978). ''Le tunumiisut, dialecte inuit du Groenland oriental: description et analyse'', Collection linguistique, 78, Societé de linguistique de Paris.</ref> Each of these dialects is almost unintelligible to the speakers of the other and are considered by some linguists to be separate languages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} A [[UNESCO]] report has labelled the other dialects as endangered, and measures are now being considered to protect the East Greenlandic dialects.<ref>{{Cite web |date=6 January 2010 |title=Sermersooq will secure Eastern Greenlandic |url=http://www.knr.gl/index.php?id=6700&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=51930&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=6702&cHash=b321fb7a1d |url-status=live |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516235314/http://www.knr.gl/index.php?id=6700&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=51930&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=6702&cHash=b321fb7a1d |archive-date=16 May 2016 |access-date=19 May 2010 |publisher=[[Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa]] |language=Danish}}</ref>

About 12% of the population speak Danish as a first or sole language, particularly Danish immigrants in Greenland, many of whom fill positions such as administrators, professionals, academics, or skilled tradesmen. While Greenlandic is dominant in all smaller settlements, a part of the population of Inuit or multi-ethnic ancestry, especially in towns, speaks Danish. Most of the Inuit population speaks Danish as a second language. In larger towns, especially Nuuk and in the higher social strata, this is still a large group. While one strategy aims at promoting Greenlandic in public life and education, developing its vocabulary and suitability for all complex contexts, there are opponents of this.<ref>{{Cite web |last=McGwin |first=Kevin |date=2018-05-09 |title=A Nuuk plan to marginalize the Danish language in Greenland worries Copenhagen |url=https://www.arctictoday.com/nuuk-plan-marginalize-danish-language-greenland-worries-copenhagen/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817152127/https://www.arctictoday.com/nuuk-plan-marginalize-danish-language-greenland-worries-copenhagen/ |archive-date=17 August 2019 |access-date=2019-08-17 |website=Arctic Today |language=en-US}}</ref>

Education is organised in a similar way to Denmark. There is ten year mandatory [[primary school]]. There is also a secondary school, with either work education or preparatory for university education. There is one university, the [[University of Greenland]] ({{lang-kl|Ilisimatusarfik}}) in Nuuk.

The nomadic [[Inuit people]] were traditionally [[shamanism among Eskimo peoples|shamanistic]], with a well-developed [[Inuit mythology|mythology]] primarily concerned with appeasing a vengeful and [[Sedna (mythology)|fingerless sea goddess]] who controlled the success of the [[seal hunting|seal]] and [[whaling|whale hunts]].

The first [[Norse colonization of Greenland|Norse colonists]] worshipped the [[Norse religion|Norse gods]], but [[Erik the Red]]'s son [[Leif Ericson|Leif]] was converted to Christianity by [[List of Norwegian monarchs|King]] [[Olaf Trygvesson]] on a trip to Norway in 999 and sent missionaries back to Greenland. These swiftly established sixteen parishes, some monasteries, and a bishopric at [[Garðar, Greenland|Garðar]].

Rediscovering these colonists and spreading ideas of the [[Danish Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] among them was one of the primary reasons for the [[Danish colonization of Greenland|Danish recolonization]] in the 18th century. Under the patronage of the [[Royal Mission College]] in Copenhagen, Norwegian and Danish [[Church of Denmark|Lutherans]] and German [[Moravian missions in Greenland|Moravian missionaries]] searched for the missing Norse settlements, but no Norse were found, and instead they began preaching to the Inuit. The principal figures in the [[Christianization]] of Greenland were [[Hans Egede|Hans]] and [[Poul Egede]] and [[Matthias Stach]]. The [[New Testament]] was translated piecemeal from the time of the very first settlement on Kangeq Island, but the first translation of the whole Bible was not completed until 1900. An improved translation using the [[Kalaallisut orthography|modern orthography]] was completed in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sørensen |first=Leif Kiil |date=29 November 2000 |title=Grønlandsk bibel præsenteret &#124; Kristeligt Dagblad |url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/225350:Kirke---tro--Groenlandsk-bibel-praesenteret |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511084103/http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/225350:Kirke---tro--Groenlandsk-bibel-praesenteret |archive-date=11 May 2011 |access-date=6 September 2010 |publisher=Kristeligt-dagblad.dk}}</ref>

Today Greenlandic culture is a blending of traditional Inuit ([[Kalaallit]], [[Tunumiit]], [[Inughuit]]) and Scandinavian culture. Inuit, or Kalaallit, culture has a strong artistic tradition, dating back thousands of years. The Kalaallit are known for an art form of figures called ''[[tupilak]]'' or a "spirit object." Traditional art-making practices thrive in the ''Ammassalik''.<ref name="ingo20">[[#Hessel|Hessel]], p. 20</ref> [[Sperm whale]] ivory remains a valued medium for carving.<ref>[[#Hessel|Hessel]], p. 21</ref>

Greenland also has a successful, albeit small, music culture. Some popular [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] bands and artists include [[Sume (band)|Sume]] (classic rock), [[Chilly Friday]] (rock), [[Nanook]] (rock), [[Siissisoq]] (rock), [[Nuuk Posse]] (hip hop) and [[Rasmus Lyberth]] (folk), who performed in the [[Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 1979|Danish national final for the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest]], performing in Greenlandic. The singer-songwriter [[Simon Lynge]] is the first musical artist from Greenland to have an album released across the United Kingdom, and to perform at the UK's [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The music culture of Greenland also includes traditional [[Inuit music]], largely revolving around singing and drums.

===Sport===
{{Main|Sport in Greenland}}
Sport is an important part of Greenlandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 109</ref> Popular sports include [[association football]], [[track and field]], [[Team handball|handball]] and [[skiing]]. Handball is often referred to as the national sport,<ref name="handball">[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 110</ref> and [[Greenland national handball team|Greenland's men's national team]] was ranked among the top 20 in the world in 2001.

Greenland has excellent conditions for [[skiing]], [[fishing]], [[snowboarding]], [[ice climbing]] and [[rock climbing]], although [[mountain climbing]] and [[hiking]] are preferred by the general public. Although the environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there is a golf course in Nuuk.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Greenlandic cuisine}}
The national dish of Greenland is [[suaasat]]. Meat from marine mammals, game, birds, and fish play a large role in the Greenlandic diet. Due to the glacial landscape, most ingredients come from the ocean.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-04-14 |title=Greenland - Greenlandic cuisine - Official Greenland Travel Guide |url=http://www.greenland.com/content/english/tourist/culture/greenlandic_cuisine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414020510/http://www.greenland.com/content/english/tourist/culture/greenlandic_cuisine |archive-date=2010-04-14 |access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref> Spices are seldom used besides salt and pepper.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-03-27 |title=Greenland - Traditional Greenlandic food - Official Greenland Travel Guide |url=http://www.greenland.com/content/english/tourist/culture/greenlandic_cuisine/traditional_greenlandic_food |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327215022/http://www.greenland.com/content/english/tourist/culture/greenlandic_cuisine/traditional_greenlandic_food |archive-date=2010-03-27 |access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref> Greenlandic coffee is a "flaming" dessert coffee (set alight before serving) made with coffee, whiskey, Kahlúa, Grand Marnier, and whipped cream.
