The '''College Football Playoff''' ('''CFP''') is an annual postseason knockout invitational tournament to determine a national champion for the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS), the highest level of [[college football]] competition in the United States. Four teams play in two semifinal games, and the winner of each semifinal advances to the [[College Football Playoff National Championship]] game.<ref name="usat">{{cite news|last=Wolken|first=Dan|title=Questions and answers for the College Football Playoff|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/04/24/college-football-playoff-questions-and-answers/2111419/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=April 25, 2013|access-date=April 25, 2013}}</ref> 

The inaugural tournament was held at the end of the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season]] and was won by the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]], who defeated the [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon Ducks]] in the championship game.<ref name=McMurphy>{{cite news|last=McMurphy|first=Brett|title=Football playoff has name and site|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9204021/football-playoff-name-site|website=ESPN.com|date=April 24, 2013|access-date=April 24, 2013}}</ref> After the first season, the playoff was dominated for several years by two teams, the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] and the [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson Tigers]]; they faced each other in the championship game three times, and in one other year they met in the semifinals.

A 13-member committee selects and seeds the four teams to take part in the CFP.<ref name="witness">{{cite web|last=Whitley|first=David|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2013-02-08/college-football-playoff-selection-committee-bcs-members-bobby-bowden-slocum|title=College football playoff selection committee members will need witness protection |publisher=AOL.SportingNews.com|date=February 8, 2013|accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref> This system differs from the use of [[sports rating system|polls or computer rankings]] that had previously been used to select the participants for the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS), the title system used in FBS from 1998 to 2013.

The two semifinal games rotate among six major bowl games, referred to as the [[New Year's Six]]: the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], [[Sugar Bowl]], [[Orange Bowl]], [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]], [[Fiesta Bowl]], and [[Peach Bowl]].<ref name="NYSix">{{cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2016-12-04/college-football-bowls-new-years-six-matchups-announced|title=College football bowls: New Year's Six matchups announced|last=Cooper|first=Ryan|date=December 4, 2016|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref> In addition to the four teams selected for the playoff, the final CFP rankings are used to help determine the participants for the other four New Year's Six bowls that are not hosting the semifinals that year. The semifinal games, which take place on the same day, are usually scheduled on Friday, Saturday, or Monday close to or on New Years Day,<ref name="espncom-cfpchanges"/> with  flexibility allowed to ensure that they are not in conflict with other bowl games traditionally held on New Year's Day.

The venue of the championship game is selected based on bids submitted by cities, similar to the [[Super Bowl]] or [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]]. The winner of the game is awarded the [[College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy]]. Playoff officials commissioned a new trophy that was unconnected with the previous championship systems, such as the [[AFCA National Championship Trophy|AFCA "crystal football" trophy]] which had been regularly presented after the championship game since the 1990s (as the AFCA was contractually obligated to name the BCS champion as the [[Coaches Poll]] champion).<ref>{{cite news|title=New College Football Playoff will reportedly feature a new trophy|author=Dennis Dodd|work=CBSSports.com|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/blog/dennis-dodd/22857775/say-goodbye-to-the-crystal-football-bcs-symbol-will-not-be-retained}}</ref>

As the NCAA does not organize or award an official national championship for FBS football (instead merely recognizing the decisions made by any of a number of independent [[major championship selectors]]), the CFP's inception in 2014 marked the first time a major national championship selector in college football was able to determine their champion by using a [[bracket (tournament)|bracket competition]].<ref>{{cite news|author1=C.N.|title=The business of college football: Undisputed champs in a disputed sport|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gametheory/2015/01/business-college-football|website=The Economist|accessdate=September 6, 2015|date=January 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name=dodd>{{cite web|last1=Dodd|first1=Dennis|title=Fringe benefit of College Football Playoff?

Long said the panel considered less frequent rankings, but ultimately decided on a weekly release.

Due to the increased emphasis on strength of schedule, teams have considered playing more challenging opponents during the non-conference portion of their schedules. Some teams have traditionally played three or four "weak" non-conference opponents, but wins against such low-level competition are unlikely to impress the committee. For teams on the cusp of making the playoff four, "I think one of the first things the committee will look at is strength of schedule," said selector [[Oliver Luck]].<ref name="olucksked">{{cite news|title=Lure of big game alters NCAA football|author=Stephen J.

Teams in the Big Ten, Big 12 and Pac-12 play nine conference games on their twelve-game schedules and thus only have flexibility in choosing their opponents for the three non-league games.

The ACC, whose teams also play eight conference games (plus Notre Dame at least once every three years), also considered moving to a nine-game conference schedule.

==Broadcasting==
The television broadcast rights to all six CFP bowls and the National Championship are owned by [[ESPN]] through at least the 2025 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8660304/espn-televise-college-football-playoff-12-year-deal|title=ESPN to televise college football playoff in 12-year deal|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=April 24, 2013|accessdate=April 26, 2013}}</ref> ESPN then reached 12-year agreements to retain rights to the Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Sugar Bowl following the dissolution of the Bowl Championship Series.<ref name=bbw-espnsugarorange>{{cite magazine|title=ESPN Reaches 12-Year College Football Agreement With Orange Bowl|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-11-15/espn-reaches-12-year-college-football-agreement-with-orange-bowl|magazine=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=November 16, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107120013/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-11-15/espn-reaches-12-year-college-football-agreement-with-orange-bowl|archivedate=January 7, 2013}}</ref> In November, ESPN reached a 12-year deal to broadcast the remaining three bowls, the championship game, as well as shoulder programming such as ranking shows; as a whole, the contract is valued at around $470 million per year, or nearly $5.7 billion for the life of the contract.<ref name=wsj-cfprights>{{cite news|title=ESPN Strikes Deal for College Football Playoff|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324851704578133223970790516|accessdate=January 9, 2016|work=Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

===Ratings===
The inaugural College Football Playoff games in January 2015 generated larger ratings than previous BCS games. The [[2015 College Football Playoff National Championship]] had an 18.9 [[Nielsen rating]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-college-football-playoff-ratings-20150113-story.html | title=College Football Playoff final sets ratings record for ESPN, cable TV | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=January 13, 2015 | accessdate=January 17, 2015}}</ref> and was watched by approximately 33.4&nbsp;million people, the largest broadcast audience of all time on American [[cable television|cable]] television (non-[[terrestrial television|broadcast]]), according to [[AdWeek]]. That was a 31 percent audience increase over the previous year's championship game and a 22 percent increase over the BCS title game's best rating on cable (a 16.1 rating in [[2011 BCS National Championship Game|2011]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/chi-ohio-state-oregon-ratings-20150113-story.html|title=New college football playoff draws larger TV audience for title game|author=Chicago Tribune|date=January 13, 2015|work=chicagotribune.com|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref> The semifinal games, the [[2015 Rose Bowl]] and [[2015 Sugar Bowl]], saw 28.16&nbsp;million and 28.27&nbsp;million viewers, respectively.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/sports/ncaafootball/sugar-bowl-attracts-2827-million-viewers.html | title=Win for ESPN, but Title Game Is the Real Test  | newspaper=The New York Times | date=January 2, 2015 | accessdate=January 17, 2015}}</ref> According to ESPN, these games also set (and briefly held) all-time records for cable TV viewership.<ref>{{cite web|title=College Football Playoff National Championship on ESPN Delivers Largest Audience in Cable History; ESPN Streaming Record for non-World Cup Programming|author=Derek Volner|publisher=ESPN Media Zone|date=January 13, 2015|accessdate=January 17, 2015|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2015/01/college-football-playoff-national-championship-espn/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=College Football Championship Sets A New Cable Ratings Record|author=Bill Chappell|publisher=NPR|date=January 13, 2015|accessdate=January 17, 2015|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/01/13/377060626/college-football-championship-sets-a-new-cable-ratings-record}}</ref>

In 2015, the ratings for the two semifinal games were down from the prior season's equivalents, with the Orange Bowl reaching a 9.7 rating (in comparison to 15.5 for the 2015 Rose Bowl) and the Cotton Bowl reaching a 9.9 rating (in comparison to a 15.3 rating for the 2015 Sugar Bowl). On the online [[WatchESPN]] streaming service, excluding [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] games, the Cotton Bowl and the Orange Bowl drew the second and third-largest streaming audiences in the service's history, behind the 2015 national championship. The ratings drops were attributed to the New Year's Eve time slot, as fewer people were at home to watch the game.<ref name=si-cfpratingsdown>{{cite web|title=College Football Playoff TV ratings drop with New Year's Eve time slots|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2016/01/01/college-football-playoff-bowl-game-tv-ratings|website=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}</ref> The decline in ratings was a factor in changes for the scheduling of future CFP semi-final games.<ref name="espncom-cfpchanges" />

==Revenue==
In 2012, ESPN reportedly agreed to pay about $7.3 billion over 12 years for broadcasting rights to all seven games, an average of about $608 million per year. That includes $215 million per year which was already committed to the Rose, Sugar and Orange bowls,<ref name="sbd">{{cite web|title=ESPN homes in on 12-year BCS package|author=John Ourand and Michael Smith|publisher=Sports Business Daily|date=November 9, 2012|accessdate=July 24, 2013|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Special-Content/News/2012/BCS-ESPN.aspx}}</ref> plus $470–475 million annually for the rest of the package.<ref name="revenue-cbs">{{cite news|title=ESPN reaches 12-year deal to air college football playoffs|author=Jerry Hinnen|work=CBSSports.com|date=November 21, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2013|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/blog/eye-on-college-football/21083689/espn-reaches-12year-deal-to-air-college-football-playoffs}}</ref> By comparison, the most recent contract with the BCS and the Rose Bowl had paid approximately $155 million per year for five games.<ref name="Forbes">{{cite magazine|title=A BCS Playoff TV Contract Will Be Worth More Than $1 Billion|author=Chrise Smith|magazine=Forbes|date=April 27, 2012|accessdate=September 18, 2017|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2012/04/27/a-bcs-playoff-tv-contract-will-be-worth-more-than-1-billion}}</ref>

The average revenue to the new system over 12 years is to be about $500 million per year. After $125–150 million in expenses, the Power Five conferences split about 71.5 percent of the remaining money, for an approximate average payout of $250 million a year ($50 million per league) over the life of the contract. The "Group of Five" conferences split 27 percent, about $90 million a year ($18 million per league). Notre Dame receives around one percent, about $3.5-4 million, and other FBS independents get about 0.5 percent of the deal.<ref name="revenueusat">{{cite news|title=College football playoff revenue distribution set|author=George Schroeder|newspaper=USA Today|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=April 26, 2014|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bowls/2012/12/11/college-football-bcs-playoff-revenue-money-distribution-payouts/1762709/}}</ref><ref name="revenueespn"/>

Extra revenue goes to conferences in contracts with the Rose, Sugar, and Orange bowls, which split revenue 50/50 between their participating leagues.<ref name="revenueusat"/> In non-semifinal years, the Rose Bowl's TV revenue would be divided between the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences; likewise, the Sugar Bowl and Orange Bowl revenue to its participant conferences. When those bowls are semifinal games, the money is distributed by the playoff system to all FBS conferences.<ref name="sbd"/> ESPN has paid about $80 million a year each for the Rose and Sugar bowls over 12 years. The Orange Bowl deal is worth $55 million per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=ESPN focuses on BCS, Big East media rights|author=Michael Smith & John Ourand|publisher=Sports Business Daily|date=October 15, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2013|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2012/10/15/Media/ESPN-BCS.aspx}}</ref> For example, in a non-semifinal year, the Big Ten could receive about $90 million (half of its $80 million Rose Bowl deal plus about $50 million from the playoff system).<ref name="revenueusat"/>

Conferences receive an additional $6 million each year for each team it places in the semifinals and $4 million for a team in one of the three at-large bowls; Notre Dame receives the same amount in either scenario. No additional money is awarded for reaching the championship game.<ref name="revenueusat"/>

The Power Five conferences and the "Group of Five" have not decided on their respective revenue-sharing formulas, though the SEC initially receives more revenue than the other four Power Five conferences due to its BCS success.<ref name="revenueusat"/><ref name="revenueespn"/> Reports say the money is to be divided based on several criteria such as "on-field success, teams' expenses, marketplace factors and academic performance of student-athletes."<ref name="revenue-espn">{{cite web|title=Playoff approved, questions remain|author=Mark Schlabach|publisher=ESPN.com|date=June 26, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2013|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8099725/college-football-playoff-approved-questions-remain}}</ref> The playoff system awards academic performance bonuses of $300,000 per school for meeting the NCAA's [[Academic Progress Rate]] standard of 930.<ref name="revenueusat"/> In a hypothetical 14-team conference, $4.2 million ($300,000 x 14) would be allocated to that league, and if only 12 of the 14 members meet the APR standard, then each of the 12 schools would receive $350,000 ($4.2 million / 12),<ref name="revenueespn">{{cite web|title=Big earnings for power conferences|author=Brett McMurphy|publisher=ESPN.com|date=December 11, 2012|accessdate=April 26, 2014|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8736544/sec-big-ten-big-12-pac-12-acc-average-91-million-new-playoff-format-sources-say}}</ref> penalizing schools that fall below the threshold.<ref name="revenue-ap">{{cite news|title=College football playoff to have 6 games, not 7|author=Ralph D.

===Board of Managers===
According to the CFP website, the system's operations are controlled by the Board of Managers, which consists of presidents and chancellors of the playoff group's member universities. The eleven members have sole authority to develop, review and approve annual budgets, policies and operating guidelines. The group also selects the company's officers.<ref name="governance">{{cite web|title=Governane|publisher=College Football Playoff|accessdate=July 7, 2015|url=http://www.collegefootballplayoff.com/governance|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708121100/http://www.collegefootballplayoff.com/governance|archive-date=July 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Although being generally well received,<ref name="Pete Thamel"/> the College Football Playoff has been criticized much like its predecessor, the [[Bowl Championship Series]], which had several [[BCS controversies|controversies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2015/10/10/college-football-playoff-mock-selection-alabama-lsu-baylor-tcu/73679798/|title=Lessons of 2011 may still apply to College Football Playoff process|date=October 10, 2015|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref>

===Team selection===

Because the tournament has four teams, at least one [[Power Five conferences|Power Five]] champion misses the playoffs every season. However, not all teams selected have been conference winners. In the [[2016–17 NCAA football bowl games|2016–17 season]], one of the teams selected was Ohio State, who did not qualify to the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game|Big Ten Championship Game]]. As a result, both the Big Ten and Big 12 champions were not selected for the playoffs (although both teams had two losses, while Ohio State only had one). In the [[2017–18 NCAA football bowl games|2017–18 season]], two of the four selected teams were from the SEC: conference champions Georgia, and Alabama, who lost to SEC runner-up Auburn. Analysts have discussed whether the committee should select conference champions only.<ref>[https://www.si.com/college-football/2017/12/03/alabama-ohio-state-playoff-rankings-format-rules Will the Alabama Outrage Spur More Changes to College Football's Format?] - Andy Staples, Sports Illustrated, December 3, 2017</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/sports/college-football-playoff.html College Football Playoff: Alabama Is In, Ohio State Is Out] - Marc Tracy, Los Angeles Times, December 3, 2017</ref>

Another critique centered around a perceived bias against smaller conferences such as the Big 12 which used to not stage a conference championship game, but was reintroduced for the 2017 season. The American Athletic Conference addressed this issue by adding Navy to its ranks for 2015, bringing its membership to 12 teams, which allowed it to stage a conference championship game under then-current NCAA rules.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_27087504/college-football-controversy-reigns-ever-over-playoff-selections|title=College football: Controversy reigns, as ever, over playoff selections|author=Jon Wilner|date=December 7, 2014|newspaper=[[The Mercury News]]|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref> Since the 2016 season, FBS conferences have been allowed to stage football championship games even if they do not have 12 members.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2016-01-13/college-football-fbs-conferences-fewer-12-members-now-able-hold |title=College football: FBS conferences with fewer than 12 members now able to hold championship game |publisher=NCAA |date=January 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}</ref>

There are opinions labeling the CFP system "just as" or "even more polarizing" than the BCS or the old wire-service poll system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/gallery/college-football-playoff-standings-top-25-rankings-poll-odds-michigan-ohio-state-111516|title=8 teams the College Football Playoff committee got totally wrong - FOX Sports|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepostgame.com/college-football-playoff-committee-washington-texas-am|title=Is College Football Playoff Committee Losing Its Legitimacy?|date=November 7, 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/sports/20141206/the-college-football-playoff-has-become-more-controversial-than-the-bcs|title=The College Football Playoff has become more controversial than the BCS|publisher=|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/watch/the-herd-with-colin-cowherd/video/joel-klatt-the-college-football-playoff-committee-is-a-joke-the-herd-110916|title=Joel Klatt: The College Football Playoff Committee is a joke - THE HERD - FOX Sports|publisher=}}</ref> However, most in sports media believe the College Football Playoff Committee got the right foursome for the 2017-18 playoff inasmuch as it included Alabama, a one-loss team excluded from its conference championship on a tiebreaker, instead of Ohio State, a two-loss conference champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-spt-greenstein-college-football-playoff-20171203-story.html|title=Column: 'Bama in, Buckeyes out? CFP selection committee got it right - Chicago Tribune|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/21654631/why-college-football-playoff-selection-committee-gave-alabama-crimson-tide-nod-ohio-state-buckeyes|title=Why the selection committee got it right - ESPN.com|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2017/12/04/college-football-playoff-selection-committee-got-it-right-with-alabama/|title=College Football Playoff selection committee got it right with Alabama - Washington Post|publisher=}}</ref> None of the commentators who agreed with the selection made any reference to the exclusion of undefeated [[2017 UCF Knights football|UCF]], a Group of Five team with a [[perfect season]] and a record that was thus better than all four CFP teams, which each had lost once.

In 2019 [[Urban Meyer]], head coach of the national champion [[2014 Ohio State Buckeyes football team]], said that he intentionally [[ran up the score]] against [[2014 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] in the [[2014 Big Ten Championship Game|Big Ten conference championship]] to help his team be chosen for the playoff. Criticizing the subjectivity of the selection process, Meyer said that he left the [[starting lineup]] in the game despite Ohio State being ahead 45-0 in the third quarter—not [[resting the starters]] and risking their health, and poor sportsmanship—because "I don't think the 'eye test' and 'people think' is going to get enough to bump [[2014 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] and [[2014 Baylor Bears football team|Baylor]]". He continued, "I had a job to do, and that was to get Ohio State in the playoff. Do I think that's right? That's wrong", proposing a selection system based on defined criteria.<ref name="cfbonfox20191020">{{Cite tweet |number=1186009943897456640 |user=CFBONFOX |title="When I hear someone say, 'look test' or 'I think,' that’s not fair.”  @CoachUrbanMeyer  addresses the CFP's selection criteria and breaks down how he would change the system. |date=2019-10-20}}</ref>

===Selection committee===
The qualifications of selection committee members has also been scrutinized. As an outsider to the sports world, [[Condoleezza Rice]] was the focus of some criticism. Former Clemson head coach [[Tommy Bowden]] opined that the committee's members should be "people who played the game and preferably coached the game".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2014/10/27/7080207/tommy-bowden-condoleezza-rice-college-football-playoff-committee|title=Tommy Bowden does not think Condoleezza Rice should be on the College Football Playoff committee|author=Kevin Trahan|date=October 27, 2014|publisher=Vox Media|work=SBNation.com|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref>  Former Auburn head coach [[Pat Dye]] said that "All she knows about football is what somebody told her ... or what she read in a book, or what she saw on television. To understand football, you've got to play with your hand in the dirt".  Former Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese also gained membership on the selection committee despite having never played football in college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/people-dont-want-condoleezza-rice-on-college-footballs-playoff-selection-committee-2013-10|title=People Don't Want Condoleezza Rice On College Football's Playoff Selection Committee  - Business Insider|author=Cork Gaines|date=October 8, 2013|work=Business Insider|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref> Former sportswriter Steve Weiberg and retired U.S. Air Force General Michael Gould are other committee members without significant football playing, coaching, or administrative experience.

===Scheduling===
The semifinal games for the 2015 season were scheduled for December 31; they were expected to have lower television viewership because the date is not a [[federal holiday]], and because the second game faced heavy competition for television viewers in primetime from New Year's Eve specials (such as ''[[New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'', which is aired by ESPN's sister broadcast network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]). Under television contracts with ESPN that predate the College Football Playoff, both the Rose and Sugar Bowl games are guaranteed exclusive TV time slots on January 1 (or January 2 if New Year's Day falls on a Sunday), regardless of whether they are hosting a semifinal game.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2015/01/12/college-football-playoff-tradition-new-years-eve-2015 | title=College Football Playoff drops ball with 2015 New Year's Eve semis | work=SI.com | date=January 12, 2015 | accessdate=January 17, 2015}}</ref>  In an interview with CBS Sports, CFP commissioner Bill Hancock suggested this scheduling issue would "change the paradigm of what New Year's Eve is all about," opining that "if you're hosting a New Year's Eve party, you better have a bunch of televisions around."<ref>{{cite web|title=Before BCS ends, the whens, wheres, whys of College Football Playoff|author=Tony Barnhart|work=CBSSports.com|date=January 6, 2014|accessdate=January 17, 2015|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/writer/tony-barnhart/24400200/before-bcs-ends-the-whens-wheres-and-whys-of-college-football-playoff}}</ref> Although ESPN proposed moving the Thursday, December 31, 2015 semifinal games to Saturday, January 2, 2016, the idea was rejected.<ref name="SI_20150702">{{cite web|title=A daunting task: Can the CFP, ESPN change old New Year's Eve habits?|author=Richard Deitsch|work=SI.com|date=July 2, 2015|accessdate=July 6, 2015|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2015/07/02/college-football-playoff-semifinals-new-years-eve}}</ref> The semifinal games' ratings were ultimately down significantly from those of the previous season.<ref name=si-cfpratingsdown/>

In an effort to reduce the impact of their New Year's Eve scheduling, the 2016 semifinal games, which fell on a Saturday, had earlier kickoff times, at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. and 7:00&nbsp;p.m. ET respectively. The [[2016 Orange Bowl]] was played in primetime on December 30, 2016, rather than in an early afternoon window on New Year's Eve. Hancock considered the earlier start times to be a compromise to reduce the games' intrusion into New Year's Eve festivities, but reiterated that there were no plans to move the semi-final games from New Year's Eve outside of years where they are hosted by the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl.<ref name="mherald-orangebowldate">{{cite news|title=Orange Bowl game is shifted to prime time on Dec. 30|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/college/orange-bowl/article64597132.html|accessdate=March 9, 2016|work=Miami Herald}}</ref><ref name="sbn-cfpsched2017">{{cite web|title=The 2017 College Football Playoff will still be on New Year's Eve, but it'll start earlier|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2016/3/7/11173288/playoff-game-kickoff-times-new-years-eve-2017|website=SB Nation|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}</ref>

On July 28, 2016, however, Hancock reversed this stance and announced revisions to the scheduling for future College Football Playoff semi-final games. The games were rescheduled so that they will not necessarily be played on New Year's Eve yearly: outside of years when they are hosted by the Rose and Sugar Bowls (where they retain their traditional New Year's Day scheduling), they will now be scheduled primarily on the last Saturday or federally observed holiday of the year. In some years, this date will land on New Year's Eve. In 2021, the games will be played on Friday, December 31, because the day will be observed as a holiday.<ref name="espncom-cfpchanges">{{cite web|title=College Football Playoff tweaks dates in upcoming seasons|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/17163763/college-football-playoff-moves-some-new-year-eve-dates|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}</ref><ref name="sicom-cfpschedulingnomorenye">{{cite web|title=College Football Playoff semis will only be on Saturdays or holidays|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2016/07/28/college-football-playoff-semifinals-schedule-saturdays-holidays|website=SI.com|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}</ref> Viewership of the 2018 semi-finals were down by 25% over the previous semi-finals, which were played on New Year's Day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/college-football-playoff-ratings-down-25-percent-scheduling-new-years-day.html|title=College Football Playoff semifinal ratings down 25 percent year-over-year|date=December 31, 2018|website=Awful Announcing|language=en-US|access-date=January 5, 2019}}</ref>

=== Eight-team playoff proposal===
A common suggestion is for the playoff to expand to an eight-team format, guaranteeing all five major conference champions a spot along with the highest ranked "Group of Five" champion. The remaining two spots would be at-large selections awarded to the next two highest ranking teams. The seed pairings would be ordered to fit the playoff format, with 1 vs. 8, 2 vs. 7, etc.

NCAA coaches were polled and asked if they were in favor of a larger playoff system. More than half of the coaches (53 percent) from the Power 5 conferences (ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, SEC and Pac-12) who voted chose an eight-team playoff, compared with 33 percent for the four-team model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/11915335/fbs-coaches-prefer-eight-team-playoff-espn-poll-shows|title=Poll: More FBS coaches favor 8-team playoff|date=2014-11-21|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref> CFP executive director Bill Hancock said his group is committed to only four teams for the next 12 years, and "there has been no discussion of expanding."
