William Inman served as ''Bloomberg Markets'' founding editor.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brock|first=Fred|title=Making Due with Less - Voluntarily or Not|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WF4eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EskEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3247,2700957&dq=bloomberg+magazine+william+inman&hl=en|accessdate=19 December 2011|newspaper=Times Daily|date=21 July 1996}}</ref>

In 1999, the magazine became part of [[Bloomberg News]] and Ronald Henkoff became editor.
