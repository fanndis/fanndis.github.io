{{Financial risk types}}

A '''bailout''' is the provision of financial help to a corporation or country which otherwise would be on the brink of failure [[bankruptcy]].

A bailout differs from the term '''''bail-in''''' (coined in 2010) under which the bondholders or depositors of global [[systemically important financial institution]]s (G-SIFIs) are forced to participate in the recapitalization process, but taxpayers are not. Some governments also have the power to participate in the insolvency process: for instance, the U.S. government intervened in the [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|General Motors bailout]] of 2009–2013.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-09/gm-bailout-ends-as-u-s-sells-last-of-government-motors-.html bloomberg.com: "GM Bailout Ends as U.S. Sells Last of ‘Government Motors’" 10 December 2013]</ref> A bailout can, but does not necessarily, avoid an insolvency process. The term ''bailout'' is [[maritime industry|maritime]] in origin and describes the act of removing water from a sinking vessel using a bucket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=bail&searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Safire|first1=William|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/opinion/06iht-edsafire.1.11699108.html?_r=0|title=Too big to fail or to bail out?|date=2008-04-06|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

==Overview==

A bailout could be done for profit motives, such as when a new investor resurrects a floundering company by buying its shares at firesale prices, or for social objectives, such as when, hypothetically speaking, a wealthy philanthropist reinvents an unprofitable [[fast food]] company into a non-profit food distribution network. However, the common use of the phrase occurs where government resources are used to support a failing company typically to prevent a greater problem or [[financial contagion]] to other parts of the economy. 
For example, the US government assumes transportation to be critical to the country's general economic prosperity.<ref>{{cite book|first=Noam|last=Chomsky|year=2006 | title=Failed States |url=https://archive.org/details/10ChomskyFailedStates}}</ref> As such, it has sometimes been the policy of the US government to protect major US companies responsible for transportation (aircraft manufacturers, train companies, automobile companies, etc.) from failure by subsidies and low-interest loans. Such companies, among others, are deemed "[[Too Big to Fail policy|too big to fail]]" because their goods and services are considered by the government to be constant universal necessities in maintaining the nation's welfare and often, indirectly, its security.<ref name='R000123'/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/20/weekinreview/20goodman.html|title= Too Big to Fail?|newspaper=nytimes.com|date=July 2008|first=Peter S.|last=Goodman}}</ref>

Emergency-type government bailouts can be controversial. Debates raged in 2008 over if and how to bail out the [[automotive industry crisis of 2008|failing auto industry in the United States]]. Those against it, like pro-[[free market]] [[radio personality]] [[Hugh Hewitt]], saw the bailout as unacceptable. He argued that the companies should be dismantled organically by the free-market forces so that [[entrepreneur]]s may arise from the ashes; that the bailout signals lower business standards for giant companies by incentivizing risk, creating [[moral hazard]] through the assurance of safety nets  that ought not be but unfortunately are considered in business equations; and that a bailout promotes centralized bureaucracy by allowing government powers to choose the terms of the bailout. Furthermore, government bailouts are criticized as [[corporate welfare]], which encourages corporate irresponsibility.

Others, such as economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]], have characterized the particular bailout as a necessary evil and have argued in 2008 that the probable incompetence in management of the car companies is an insufficient reason to let them fail completely and to risk disturbing the delicate economic state of the United States, as up to three million jobs rested on the solvency of the Big Three and things were bleak enough as they were.<ref>{{cite news|surname=Sachs|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/16/AR2008111601743.html|date=Nov 2008|newspaper=washingtonpost.com|title= A Bridge for the Carmakers}}</ref>

[[Randall D. Guynn]] noted similar arguments for the financial bailouts of 2008, explaining that most policymakers considered bailouts to be the lesser of two evils, given the lack of effective resolution options at the time.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Randall D. Guynn |journal= Yale Journal on Regulation |volume= 29 |title= Are Bailouts Inevitable?|issue= 1 |url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjreg/vol29/iss1/5/|date= January 2012 }}</ref>

In the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], large amounts of government support were used to protect the financial system, and many of those actions were attacked as bailouts. Over $1 trillion of government support was deployed in this period and "voters were furious."<ref>{{cite news|surname=Groendahl|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/bail-in|date=November 8, 2017|publisher=bloomberg.com|title=Bail-In}}</ref> The US [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] authorized up to $700bn of government support of which $426bn was invested in banks,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ally-financial-exits-tarp-as-treasury-sells-remaining-stake-1419000430|newspaper=wsj.com|title=Bank Bailouts Approach a Final Reckoning}}</ref> [[American International Group]], automakers, and other assets.

In the United Kingdom, the [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|bank rescue package]] was even larger, totaling some £500bn.

Controversial bailouts occurred in other countries as well, such as Germany (the [[SoFFin]] rescue fund), Switzerland (the rescue of UBS),<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/16/ubs-creditsuisse|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Switzerland unveils bank bail-out plan}}</ref> Ireland (the "blanket guarantee" of Irish domestic banks issued in September 2008),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntma.ie/IrishEconomy/bankGuaranteeScheme.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302085910/http://www.ntma.ie/IrishEconomy/bankGuaranteeScheme.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-03-02|publisher=NTMA|title=Bank Guarantee Scheme}}</ref> and several other countries in Europe.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/answerson/eu-bank-bailout-trillion-euros-allocated-graphic/|publisher=thomsonreuters.com|title=EU bank bailout breakdown – how 1.6 trillion euros were allocated}}</ref>

==Bailout vs. bail-in==

A bail-in is the opposite of a bail-out because it does not rely on external parties, especially government capital support. A bail-in creates new capital to rescue a failing firm through an internal recapitalization and forces the borrower's creditors to bear the burden by having part of the debt they are owed written off or converted into equity. (For example, in the case of the Cyprus banks in 2013, the creditors in question were bondholders, and the bail-in was of depositors with more than €100,000 in their accounts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bank of Cyprus depositors lose 47.5% of savings |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/29/bank-of-cyprus-depositors-lose-savings/2595837/ |access-date=21 June 2018 |work=USA TODAY |language=en}}</ref>)


===Theory===
The bail-in was first proposed publicly in an Economist Op-Ed "From Bail-out to Bail-in" in January 2010,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/node/15392186|newspaper=The Economist|title=From bail-out to bail-in}}</ref> by Paul Calello and Wilson Ervin. It was described as a new alternative between "taxpayer bail-outs (bad) and systemic financial collapse (probably worse)." It envisioned a high-speed recapitalization financed by "bailing-in" (converting) bondholder debt into fresh equity. The new capital would absorb losses and provide new capital to support critical activities, thereby avoiding a sudden disorderly collapse or fire sale, as seen in the [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman]] failure. Management would be fired and shareholders would displaced by the bailed-in bondholders, but the franchise, employees and core services could continue, supported by the newly converted capital.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iflr.com/Article/3435486/The-birth-of-bail-in.html|publisher=[[International Financial Law Review]]|title=The birth of bail-in}}</ref>

Around the same time, the [[Bank of England]] was developing similar architecture,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bis.org/fsi/p180209_tucker.pdf|title=RESOLUTION POLICY AND RESOLVABILITY AT THE CENTRE OF FINANCIAL STABILITY REGIMES?}}</ref> given the pressing need for a better tool to handle failing banks in the wake of the financial crisis.  The first official discussion of bail-in was set out in a speech by [[Paul Tucker (banker)|Paul Tucker]], who chaired the [[Financial Stability Board]] (FSB) Working Group on Cross Border Crisis Management and was also deputy governor for Financial Stability at the Bank of England.  In March 2010, Tucker began to outline the properties of a new "bail-in" strategy to handle the failure of a large bank:

{{Quote
|text="A quite different, and rather more profound approach would be to deploy a super special resolution framework that permitted the authorities, on a rapid timetable, to haircut uninsured creditors in a going concern."
}}

By October 2011, the FSB Working Group had developed this thinking considerably and published the "Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions." The document set out core principles to be adopted by all participating jurisdictions, including the legal and operational capability for such a super special resolution regime (now known as "bail-in").<ref>{{cite web |url= https://fic.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/12-17.pdf |author= Thomas F. Huertas |title= The Case for Bail-ins }}</ref>

The scope of the planned resolution regime was not limited to large domestic banks. In addition to "systemically significant or critical" financial institutions, the scope also applies to two further categories of institutions Global SIFIs (banks incorporated domestically in a country that is implementing the bail-in regime) and "Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs)" like clearing houses. The inclusion of FMIs in potential bail-ins is in itself a major departure. The FSB defines those market infrastructures to include multilateral securities and derivatives clearing and settlement systems and a whole host of exchange and transaction systems, such as payment systems, central securities depositories, and trade depositories. That would mean that an unsecured creditor claim to, for example, a clearing house institution or a stock exchange could in theory be affected if such an institution needed to be bailed in.

The cross-border elements of the resolution of globally significant banking institutions (G-SIFIs) were a topic of a joint paper by the [[Federal Reserve]] and the [[Bank of England]] in 2012.

Outgoing Deputy Director of the [[Bank of England]] [[Paul Tucker (banker)|Paul Tucker]] chose to open his academic career at Harvard with an October 2013 address in Washington to the [[Institute of International Finance]] in which he argued that resolution had advanced enough in several countries that bailouts would not be required and so would be bailed-in, notably the US G-SIBs. Although they were still large, they were no longer [[too big to fail]] because of the improvements in resolution technology.

In a similar vein, a GAO report in 2014 determined that the market expectation of bailouts for the largest "too big to fail" banks had been largely eliminated by the reforms. That was determined by various methods, especially by comparing the funding cost of the biggest banks with smaller banks that are subject to ordinary FDIC resolution. That differential, which had been large in the crisis, had been reduced to roughly zero by the advance of reform, but the GAO also cautioned that the results should be interpreted with caution.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/670/665163.pdf|title= Large Bank Holding Companies}}</ref>

In Europe, the EU financial community symposium on the "Future of Banking in Europe" (December 2013) was attended by Irish Finance Minister [[Michael Noonan (Fine Gael politician)|Michael Noonan]], who proposed a bail-in scheme in light of the banking union that was under discussion at the event.<ref>[http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/noonan-credit-line-can-break-doom-cycle-251474.html Irish Examiner, 3 Dec 2013: "Noonan: Credit line can break doom cycle"]</ref> Deputy BoE Director [[Jon Cunliffe]] suggested in a March 2014 speech at [[Chatham House]] that the domestic banks were too big to fail, but instead of the [[nationalisation]] process used in the case of [[HBOS]], [[The Royal Bank of Scotland Group|RBS]] and threatened for [[Barclays]] (all in late 2008), those banks could henceforth be bailed in.<ref name=wilson>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/10702476/BoE-has-no-confidence-a-failing-big-bank-could-be-saved.html telegraph.co.uk: "BoE has 'no confidence' a failing big bank could be saved" (Wilson) 17 Mar 2014]</ref>

A form of bail-in was used in small Danish institutions (such as Amagerbanken) as early as 2011,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/281c7f70-855f-11e0-ae32-00144feabdc0|newspaper=Financial Times|title= Concerns grow over Denmark's bail-in rules}}</ref> as well as the later conversion of junior debt at the Dutch Bank SNS REALL. However, the process did not receive extensive global attention until the bail-in of the main banks of Cyprus during 2013, discussed below. The restructuring of the Co-op bank in the UK (2013) has been described as a voluntary or negotiated bail-in.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/120651482806846750/FinSAC-BRRD-and-Bail-In-CaseStudies.pdf |publisher= World Bank |title= BANK RESOLUTION AND "BAIL-IN" IN THE EU: SELECTED CASE STUDIES PRE AND POST BRRD}}</ref>

===Legislative and executive efforts===
The [[Dodd-Frank Act]] legislates bank resolution procedures for the United States under Title I and Title II.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/gruenberg/statement20131210.html |publisher= FDIC |title= Statement by Martin J. Gruenberg, Chairman, FDIC on Single Point of Entry Resolution Strategy}}</ref> Title I refers to the preferred route, which is to resolve a bank under bankruptcy procedures aided by extensive pre-planning (a "living will").<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/resplans/ |publisher= FDIC |title= Title I and IDI Resolution Plans}}</ref>

Title II establishes additional powers that can be used if bankruptcy is seen to pose "serious and adverse effects on financial stability in the United States," as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, together with two thirds Federal Reserve Board and two thirds of the FDIC board.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.davispolk.com/files/uploads/OLA.Presentation.11.30.11.pdf|publisher=Davis Polk|title=A Creditor's Guide to the FDIC's Orderly Liquidation Authority}}</ref> Like Title I, it would force shareholders and creditors to bear the losses of the failed financial company, "removing management that was responsible for the financial condition of the company." The procedures also establish certain protections for creditors, such as by setting a requirement for the payout to claimants to ve at least as much as the claimants would have received under a bankruptcy liquidation.

The FDIC has drawn attention to the problem of post-resolution governance and suggested that a new CEO and Board of Directors should be installed under FDIC receivership guidance.

Claims are paid in the following order, and any deficit to the government must be recouped by assessments on the financial industry:<ref name=corn>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/dodd-frank_title_II cornell.edu: "Dodd-Frank: Title II - Orderly Liquidation Authority"]</ref>

# Administrative costs
# The government
# Wages, salaries, or commissions of employees
# Contributions to employee benefit plans
# Any other general or senior liability of the company
# Any junior obligation
# Salaries of executives and directors of the company 
# Obligations to shareholders, members, general partners, and other equity holders

A number of strategies were explored early on to determine how Title I and Title II powers could be best used to resolve a large failing bank,<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/quarterly/2011-vol5-2/article2.pdf|publisher=Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|title=The Orderly Liquidation of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. under the Dodd-Frank Act}}</ref> including "Purchase and Assumption" and "Loss Sharing." Over time, the preferred approach evolved to a bail-in strategy, which is more direct, as it does not require an acquisition party.  That approach was developed under the FDIC Office of Complex Financial Institutions group led by James R. Wigand. The approach is described in a slide deck from January 2012 as well as in Congressional testimony.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/speeches/spmay1513_2.pdf|publisher=Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|title=The Orderly Liquidation of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. under the Dodd-Frank Act}}</ref>

The specific strategy for implementing a bail-in under the Dodd Frank Act requirements has been described as the "Single Point of Entry mechanism." The innovative FDIC strategy was described by Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as a "classic simplifier, making theoretically possible something that seemed impossibly complex." It created a relatively simple path by which bail-in could be implemented under the existing Dodd-Frank powers. Powell explained:

{{Quote
|text="Under single point of entry, the FDIC will be appointed receiver of only the top-tier parent holding company of the failed financial group. Promptly after the parent holding company is placed into receivership, the FDIC will transfer the assets of the parent company (primarily its investments in subsidiaries) to a bridge holding company. Equity claims of the failed parent company's shareholders will be wiped out, and claims of its unsecured debt holders will be written down as necessary to reflect any losses in the receivership that the shareholders cannot cover. To capitalize the bridge holding company and the operating subsidiaries, and to permit transfer of ownership and control of the bridge company back to private hands, the FDIC will exchange the remaining claims of unsecured creditors of the parent for equity and/or debt claims of the bridge company. If necessary, the FDIC would provide temporary liquidity to the bridge company until the 'bail-in' of the failed parent company's creditors can be accomplished."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20130304a.htm|publisher=The Federal Reserve|title=Ending "Too Big to Fail"}}</ref>  
}}

A comprehensive overview of this strategy is available in the Bipartisan Policy Center report "Too Big to Fail:  The Path to a Solution."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://bipartisanpolicy.org/library/too-big-fail-path-solution-525/|publisher=Bipartisan Policy Center|title=Too Big to Fail: The Path to a Solution}}</ref>

The [[Canadian government]] clarified its rules for bail-ins in the "Economic Action Plan 2013," at pages 144-145 "to reduce the risk for taxpayers."<ref>[http://www.budget.gc.ca/2013/doc/plan/budget2013-eng.pdf see pages 144 and 145 of Government of Canada "Economic Action Plan 2013″ budget document]</ref>{{citation needed|reason=Needs evidence that the intentions have materialized|date=March 2014}}

The [[Eurogroup]] proposed on 27 June 2013 that after 2018, bank shareholders would be first in line to assume the losses of a failed bank before bondholders and certain large depositors. Insured deposits under £85,000 (€100,000) would be exempt and, with specific exemptions, uninsured deposits of individuals and small companies would be given preferred status in the bail-in pecking order for taking losses. That agreement formalised the practice seen earlier in Cyprus. Under the proposal, all unsecured bondholders would be hit for losses before a bank was allowed to receive capital injections directly from the [[European Stability Mechanism]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/10145355/EU-makes-bank-creditors-bear-losses-as-Cyprus-bail-in-becomes-blue-print-for-rescues.html telegraph.co.uk: "EU makes bank creditors bear losses as Cyprus bail-in becomes blue-print for rescues", 27 Jun 2013]</ref> A tool known as the [[Single Resolution Mechanism]], which was agreed by Eurogroup members on 20 March 2014, was part of an EU effort to prevent future financial crises by pooling responsibility for eurozone banks, known as a banking union.

From the many bailouts over the course of the 20th century, certain principles and lessons have emerged that are consistent:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgemonitor.com/financemarkets-monitor/253015/lessons_from_bailout_history_ii |title=Mason-Lessons from Bailouts Part 2 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003080255/http://www.rgemonitor.com/financemarkets-monitor/253015/lessons_from_bailout_history_ii |archive-date=2008-10-03 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.rgemonitor.com/financemarkets-monitor/253803/tarp_us_2008__ccpc_japan_1992 Lessons from Japan Bailout] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930224111/http://www.rgemonitor.com/financemarkets-monitor/253803/tarp_us_2008__ccpc_japan_1992 |date=2008-09-30 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2008/wp08224.pdf IMF Paper]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1848975,00.html?xid=site-cnn-partner |title= Time Magazine - Lessons from Japan & Asia |date=10 October 2008}}</ref>
* Central banks should provide loans to help the system cope with [[liquidity]] concerns if banks are unable or unwilling to provide loans to businesses or individuals. Lending into illiquidity but not insolvency was articulated at least as early as 1873 in ''[[Lombard Street, A Description of the Money Market]]'', by [[Walter Bagehot]].
* Insolvent institutions (those with insufficient funds to pay their short-term obligations or those with more debt than assets) should be allowed to fail in an orderly way.
* The true financial position of key financial institutions should be clearly understood by [[audits]] or other means. The extent of losses and quality of assets should be known and reported by the institutions.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/business/economy/13yen.html?_r=1&ref=business |title= NYT-Lessons from Japan |work= The New York Times |first=Hiroko |last=Tabuchi |date=13 February 2009}}</ref>
* Banks that are deemed healthy enough or important enough to survive but require recapitalization from the government providing funds should be done in exchange for ownership rights such as preferred stock, which receives a cash dividend over time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clusterstock.com/2008/10/history-of-bailouts-what-kinds-work-and-why-ours-won-t |title= Blodgett History of Bailouts}}</ref>
* Government should take an ownership (equity or stock) interest to the extent that taxpayer assistance is provided so that taxpayers can benefit later. In other words, the government becomes the owner and can later obtain funds by issuing new [[common stock]] shares to the public when the nationalized institution is later privatized.
* A special government entity can be useful to administer the program, such as the [[Resolution Trust Corporation]].
* Dividend payments may be restricted to ensure taxpayer money are used for loans and strengthening the bank, rather than payments to investors.
* Interest rate cuts lower lending rates and thus stimulate the economy.

==Criticism==
* [[Moral hazard]] is created, potentially lowering business standards, by the assurance of safety nets.
* A centralized [[bureaucracy]] is promoted by allowing government powers to choose winners and losers in the economy. [[Paul Volcker]], chairman of [[Barack Obama]]'s [[President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness|White House Economic Recovery Advisory Board]], said that bailouts create moral hazard. They signal to the firms that they can take reckless risks, and if the risks are realized, taxpayers will pay the losses: "The danger is the spread of moral hazard could make the next crisis much bigger."<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&sid=aKPBxT0cjj5E |title= Volcker Criticizes Obama Plan on 'Systemically Important' Firms | work=Bloomberg | date=24 September 2009}} Bloomberg, 2009-09-24</ref>

On November 24, 2008, American [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Representative [[Ron Paul]] (R–TX) wrote, "In bailing out failing companies, they are confiscating money from productive members of the economy and giving it to failing ones.  By sustaining companies with obsolete or unsustainable business models, the government prevents their resources from being liquidated and made available to other companies that can put them to better, more productive use.  An essential element of a healthy free market is that both success and failure must be permitted to happen when they are earned.  But instead with a bailout, the rewards are reversed – the proceeds from successful entities are given to failing ones. How this is supposed to be good for our economy is beyond me.... It won't work. It can't work.... It is obvious to most Americans that we need to reject corporate cronyism, and allow the natural regulations and incentives of the free market to pick the winners and losers in our economy, not the whims of bureaucrats and politicians."<ref>[http://www.house.gov/htbin/blog_inc?BLOG,tx14_paul,blog,999,All,Item%20not%20found,ID=081124_2545,TEMPLATE=postingdetail.shtml The Bailout Surge], by Ron Paul, 11-24-2008</ref>

* Significant costs on governments and taxpayers can be caused. In extreme cases, the country's borrowing costs can be raised, or the country can even be bankrupted, as in the Ireland bailout of 2008.  The IMF said that "the failure to bail-in unsecured creditors to a bank rescue that cost Irish taxpayers €64  bn and bankrupted the country was based on the view that doing so would have serious adverse 'spillover' effects in other eurozone countries, even though such risks were 'not obvious.'"<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.ft.com/content/5f3131a4-a7ca-11e4-8e78-00144feab7de |title= IMF points to failures in Ireland bank bailout |work= The Financial Times}}</ref> In the 2012 eurozone crisis, other countries such as Italy were affected by a so-called "[[doom loop]]," which increased the cost of government borrowing because bailouts can "torpedo state finances if banks need to be bailed out."<ref>{{cite news |url= https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-banks-idUKBRE9BF13O20131216 |title= 'Doom loop' tying European banks and governments reinforced |work= Reuters}}</ref>

==Costs==

In 2000, the [[World Bank]] reported that banking bailouts cost an average of 12.8% of GDP per event:<ref>{{cite web|title=Patrick Honohan and Daniela Klingebiel, Development Research Group, Finance and Sector Strategy and Policy Department, "Controlling the Fiscal Costs of Banking Crises" |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2000/11/04/000094946_0010200530432/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf}} September 2000</ref>
{{Quote|text=Governments and, thus ultimately taxpayers, have largely shouldered the direct costs of banking system collapses. These costs have been large: in our sample of 40 countries governments spent on average 12.8 percent of national GDP to clean up their financial systems.}}

===Irish banking rescue===
{{main|2008–2011 Irish banking crisis}}
The Irish banking crisis of 2008 has similarities to other banking crisis, but it was unique in that it was the first banking crisis in a country that was a member of the eurozone. That made the Irish government and central bank have unique constraints when the crisis struck.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/imf-s-analysis-irish-bailout|title=The IMF's analysis of the Irish bailout|date=2015-11-17|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref> The [[post-2008 Irish economic downturn]] was also unusually steep. The impact on Irish government credit was so severe that it was forced to seek assistance from the European Union and the IMF.

===Swedish banking rescue===
In 1991 and 1992, a [[housing bubble]] in [[Sweden]] deflated, resulting in a severe [[credit crunch]] and widespread bank insolvency. The causes were similar to those of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of 2007–2008. In response, the government took the following actions:<ref>{{cite news | first=Carter| last=Dougherty| title=Stopping a Financial Crisis, the Swedish Way | date=2008-09-22 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/business/worldbusiness/23krona.html | work =[[The New York Times]] | access-date = 2008-09-24 }}</ref>

*Sweden's government assumed bad bank debts, but banks had to write down losses and issue an ownership interest ([[common stock]]) to the government. [[Shareholder]]s were typically wiped out, but [[bond (finance)|bondholder]]s were protected.
*When distressed assets were later sold, the profits flowed to [[taxpayer]]s, and the government was able to recoup more money later by selling its shares in the companies in [[direct public offering|public offering]]s.
*The government announced that it would guarantee all [[bank deposit]]s and [[creditor]]s of the nation's 114 banks.
*Sweden formed a new agency to supervise institutions that needed recapitalization and another to sell off the assets, mainly real estate, which the banks held as collateral.

The bailout initially cost about 4% of Sweden's GDP, later lowered to 0–2% of GDP, depending on the various assumptions if the value of stock that was sold when the nationalized banks were privatized.

===US savings and loan crisis===
In the late 1980s and the early 1990s, over 1000 thrift institutions failed as part of the [[savings and loan crisis]]. In response, the US established the [[Resolution Trust Corporation]] (RTC) in 1989. The cost of this bailout was estimated at $132.1bn to taxpayers.

===TARP and related programs in US===
{{Main|Troubled Asset Relief Program}}
In 2008 and 2009 the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve System bailed out numerous huge banks and insurance companies as well as [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]]. Congress, at the urgent request of US President [[George W. Bush]], passed the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP), authorized at $700 billion. The bank sectors repaid the money by December 2009, and TARP actually returned a profit to taxpayers.<ref>Linus Wilson and Yan Wendy Wu, "Escaping tarp." ''Journal of Financial Stability'' 8.1 (2012): 32-42.</ref> The separate bailout of [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]], which insure mortgages, totaled $135 billion by October 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130732190|title=Tamara Keith, "Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac Bailout Costs Could Soar" NPR, Oct. 21, 2010}}</ref>

The issue of federal bailouts of the banks and big corporations has become a major issue in elections, with the [[Tea Party movement]] in particular focusing its attack on bailouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politics.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/brad-bannon/2010/09/09/Bank-Bailout-Spawned-Obama-and-Dems-Tea-Party-Problem|title=Brad Bannon, "Bank Bailout Spawned Obama and Dems' Tea Party Problem," ''USNews'', September 9, 2010 }}</ref>
