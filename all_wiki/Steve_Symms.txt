==Early life and education==
Symms attended public schools in [[Canyon County, Idaho|Canyon County]] and graduated from [[Caldwell High School (Idaho)|Caldwell High School]] in 1956. He studied [[horticulture]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1960/322|publisher=Gem of the Mountains, University of Idaho yearbook|title=Seniors|year=1960|page=318}}</ref> at the [[University of Idaho]] in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]], where he was a reserve [[Center (American football)|center]] on the [[Idaho Vandals football|football team]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1960/259|publisher=Gem of the Mountains, University of Idaho yearbook|title=Football|year=1960|page=255}}</ref> and was a member of [[Sigma Nu]] [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/uidahodigital/docs/gem1960/223|publisher=Gem of the Mountains, University of Idaho yearbook|title=Sigma Nu|year=1960|page=219}}</ref> He graduated in 1960 with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[agriculture]], then served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] for three years, after which he worked as a private pilot and apple farmer. From 1969 to 1972, he was co-editor of the college newspaper, ''The'' ''Idaho Compass''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/22539|title=History, Art & Archives_Steven Douglas Symms|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

==Career==

=== Congress ===
In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1972#Idaho|1972]], Symms ran for [[United States Congress|Congress]], highlighting his career as an apple farmer by using the slogan "Take a bite out of big government!" He was elected to the open seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] at age 34 and was re-elected three times. He ran for the [[United States Senate]] in [[United States Senate election in Idaho, 1980|1980]]. Aided by national funding,<ref name=accgnt>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i6ZfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UzIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3807,4483168|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|agency=Associated Press|title=Anti-Church committee goes national|date=July 13, 1979 |page=5C}}</ref><ref name=bfas>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nYBRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZQgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3571,3470328 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review|agency=Associated Press|title=Broadside fired at Symms |date=August 8, 1980|page=8 }}</ref> he unseated four-term [[incumbent]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Frank Church]], winning by less than one percent.<ref name=sbigohwsv>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W61fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0DIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4369%2C2366596|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|agency=Associated Press|title=Symms basks in the glow of hard-won Senate victory |date=November 6, 1980|page=6A}}</ref> Symms was re-elected in [[United States Senate election in Idaho, 1986|1986]], defeating Democratic [[Governor of Idaho|Governor]] [[John Evans (Idaho governor)|John V. Evans]] in another hard-fought and close election.<ref name=npotrinid>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gDFkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yfkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6978,2681874|newspaper=Spokane Chronicle|last=Kenyon|first=Quane|agency=Associated Press|title=No political truce in Idaho|date=October 28, 1986|page=A4}}</ref>

Symms was one of several Republican senators who, in 1981, called into the White House to express discontent over the nomination of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]; the opposition hinged over the issue of O'Connor's presumed unwillingness to overturn ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.<ref>Greenburg, Jan Crawford. Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court.2007. Penguin Books. p. 222.</ref>

During the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 U.S. presidential election]], Symms claimed in a radio interview that a photograph existed from the 1960s showing [[Kitty Dukakis]], the wife of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Michael Dukakis]], burning an American flag to protest the [[Vietnam War]]. Kitty Dukakis angrily denied the accusation as "totally false and beneath contempt," and Symms later admitted that he could not substantiate it.<ref name="Nytimes1988-08-26" /><ref name="MyrtleBeach2004-09-04" /> Nevertheless, the claim became national news, as media outlets began searching for the photograph Symms said he had "heard" about.<ref name="Nytimes1988-08-29" /> The flag-burning story was one of several false rumors about Dukakis that circulated during the 1988 campaign. "Mr. Symms's comment was the third time in a few days that prominent Republicans have publicly aired allegations that the Democrats have swiftly rebutted," ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported.<ref name="Nytimes1988-08-26" />

According to Salon magazine, during Symms' time in Washington, he "gained something of a sexual legend over his eight years in the House that grew larger once he was in the Senate; it was widely known among reporters that he was a big-time D.C. party animal and could be seen most evenings in the company of a woman other than his wife, Fran. She in fact was a kind, sweet woman who suffered terribly from arthritis and couldn't socialize much. Most of the state's political reporters knew about the situation but figured it was no one's business unless Symms made it an issue. However, when Fran finally had enough and divorced him, the emergent details of his philandering - and the ensuing shelled-out poll numbers - persuaded him to not pursue reelection in 1992."<ref>Neiwert, David (September 1, 1998) [https://www.salon.com/1998/09/16/news_111/ "Lives of the Republicans: Part Two."] ''Salon.com.'' (Retrieved September 29, 2010.)</ref>

Symms was also one of the six senators who voted against the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Holmes|first=Steven A.|last2=Times|first2=Special To the New York|date=1990-07-14|title=Rights Bill for Disabled Is Sent to Bush|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/14/us/rights-bill-for-disabled-is-sent-to-bush.html|access-date=2020-09-29|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Symms chose not to seek a third term in [[United States Senate election in Idaho, 1992|1992]] and was succeeded by the Republican mayor of [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Dirk Kempthorne]], a future two-term Idaho [[List of Governors of Idaho|governor]] and [[United States Secretary of the Interior]].

=== Later career ===
After leaving the U.S. Senate in 1993,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Senators of the United States: A Historical Bibliography: A compilation of works by and about members of the United States Senate 1789-1995|last=Boyle|first=Diane B.|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=321}}</ref> Symms founded Symms, Lehn Associates, Inc., a [[Consultant|consulting]] firm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S001138|title=SYMMS, Steven Douglas - Biographical Information|website=bioguide.congress.gov|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref> In January 1999, he partnered with John Haddow and formed Symms & Haddow Associates, a [[lobbying]] firm.

Pointing a finger at the Bush campaign, he said, 'There's no question that rumor has developed into a new art form in this campaign. He was referring to a recent statement by Senator Steve Symms, Republican of Idaho, who said that he understood there were pictures showing that Kitty Dukakis, the candidate's wife, had burned an American flag. Mrs. Dukakis angrily denied the accusation, and Mr. Symms later acknowledged that he had no proof. But it was on television before he drew back.
