'''Excellency''' is an [[honorific]] [[style (manner of address)|style]] given to certain high-level officers of a [[sovereign state]], officials of an [[international organization]], or members of an [[aristocracy]]. Once entitled to the title "Excellency", the holder usually{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} retains the right to that courtesy throughout their lifetime, although in some cases the title is attached to a particular office, and is held only for the duration of that office.<ref>''Protocol - The Complete Handbook of Diplomatic, Official, and Social Usage'' (page 21), by [[Mary Jane McCaffree]] and Pauline Innes, published by Hepburn Books, Dallas, Texas [http://www.usaprotocol.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301195037/http://www.usaprotocol.com/ |date=1 March 2012 }}, 1977, 1985, 1989, 1997 {{ISBN|0-941402-04-5}}</ref>

Generally people addressed as ''Excellency'' are [[head of state|heads of state]], [[head of government|heads of government]], [[governor]]s, [[ambassador]]s, [[Bishops in the Catholic Church|Catholic bishops]] and high ranking ecclesiates and others holding equivalent rank (e.g., heads of international organizations).{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Members of [[royal family|Royalty]] generally have distinct addresses (Majesty, Highness, etc.)

It is sometimes misinterpreted as a title of office in itself, but in fact is an honorific that precedes various titles (such as [[Mr. President (title)|Mr. President]], and so on), both in speech and in writing. In reference to such an official, it takes the form ''His'' or ''Her Excellency''; in direct address, ''Your Excellency'', or, less formally, simply ''Excellency''
The abbreviation ''HE'' is often used instead of ''His/Her Excellency''; alternatively it may stand for ''[[His Eminence]]''.

==Government==

===Heads of state and government===
In most [[republic]]an [[nation state]]s, the [[head of state]] is formally addressed as ''His or Her Excellency''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.pravda.com.ua/authors/leschenko/5047cb4f8f5fa/ |title=Три привітання для Януковича (Three greetings for Yanukovych) |publisher=Blogs.pravda.com.ua |date= 5 September 2012}}</ref>

If a republic has a separate [[head of government]], that official is almost always addressed as ''Excellency'' as well. If the nation is a [[monarchy]], however, the customs may vary.  For example, in the case of Australia, all ambassadors, high commissioners, state governors and the governor-general and their spouses are entitled to the use of Excellency.

Governors of colonies in the [[British Empire]] were entitled to be addressed as ''Excellency'' and this remains the position for the governors of what are now known as [[British Overseas Territories]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Running the Show: Governors of the British Empire|last1=Williams|first1=Stephanie|publisher=Viking|year=2011|isbn=978-0-670-91804-1}}<!--| accessdate = 2011-09-30 --></ref>

===International diplomacy===
In various [[international organization]]s, notably the UN and its agencies, ''Excellency'' is used as a generic form of address for all republican [[heads of state]] and [[heads of government]]. It is often granted to the organization's head as well, and to those chiefs of UN diplomatic missions, such as [[Resident Coordinator]]s (who are the designated representatives of the Secretary-General), who are accredited at the Head of State level (like an Ambassador), or at the lower Head of Government level.

In recent years, some international organizations, such as the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], or the [[European Union]], have designated their [[permanent representative]]s in third countries as ''ambassadors'', although they do not represent sovereign entities. This is now largely accepted, and because these ''ambassadors'' rank after the UN representative in the orders of precedence of representatives of international organizations, the UN coming naturally first as pre-eminent, the UN Resident Coordinators are now also commonly but informally referred to in diplomatic circles as ''ambassadors'', although the UN itself does not refer to them in this way.

===International judiciary===
Judges of the [[International Court of Justice]] are also called ''Your Excellency''.

==Monarchy==

===Royalty===
In some monarchies the [[husband]]s, [[wife|wives]], or children, of a [[royal prince]] or princess, who do not possess a princely title themselves, may be entitled to the style. For example, in [[Spain]] spouses or children of a born ''[[infante]]'' or ''[[infanta]]'' are addressed as ''Excellency'', if not accorded a higher style.

Also, former members of a royal house or family, who ''did'' have a royal title but forfeited it, may be awarded the style afterwards. Examples are former husbands or wives of a royal prince or princess, including [[Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg]], following her divorce from [[Prince Joachim of Denmark]]. Likewise, [[Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg]], who lost his succession rights to the [[Sweden|Swedish]] throne and discontinued use of his royal titles in 1946 when he married the commoner Elin Kerstin Margaretha Wijkmark, was accorded the style.

In some [[emirate]]s (e.g., [[Kuwait]] or [[Qatar]]), only the Emir, heir apparent and prime minister are called ''His Highness''. Their children are styled with the lower treatment of ''His/Her Excellency'' (unless they possess a higher honorific).

===Nobility===
In Spain members of the high nobility, holding the dignity of [[grandee]], are addressed as ''The Most Excellent Lord/Lady''.

In Denmark, some [[count]]s (''lensgrever''), historically those related by blood or marriage to the [[Monarchy of Denmark|monarch]], who have entered a [[morganatic marriage]] or otherwise left the [[Danish royal family|Royal Family]] have the right to be styled as ''Your Excellency'', e.g., the Counts of Danneskiold-Samsøe, some of the [[Danish royal family#count-of-rosenborg|counts of Rosenborg]] and the [[Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg|Countess of Frederiksborg]] (''[[ad personam]]'').

In the [[Sultanate of Sulu]], senior nobility and holders of royal offices that are granted the title of [[Datu Sadja]] are addressed as ''His/Her Excellency.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://orderofthepearl.org/nobility-of-sulu/|title=Nobility of Sulu|website=ROYAL AND HASHEMITE ORDER OF THE PEARL|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref>

=== Knights ===
''Excellency'' can also attach to a prestigious quality, notably in an order of knighthood. For example, in the [[Empire of Brazil]], it was attached to the highest classes, each time called ''[[Grand Cross]]'', of all three imperial orders: [[Order of Pedro I|Imperial Order of Pedro I]], [[Order of the Southern Cross|Imperial Order of the Southern Cross]] (in this case, also enjoying the military honours of a [[Lieutenant general]]) and [[Order of the Rose]].

In modern days, Knights Collar and Knights Grand Cross of the Spanish Orders of Chivalry, like the [[Order of Charles III]], [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]], [[Order of Civil Merit]], [[Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise|Order of Alfonso X the Wise]], [[Royal Order of Sports Merit]], [[Civil Order of Health]], as well as recipients of the Grand Cross of [[Crosses of Military Merit (Spain)|Military]], [[Crosses of Naval Merit (Spain)|Naval]], and [[Crosses of Aeronautical Merit (Spain)|Aeronautical Merit]] are addressed as such. Furthermore, Knights Grand Cross of the [[Order of Saint Gregory the Great]] and the [[Order of St. Sylvester]] of the [[Holy See]], Knights of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], and Knights Grand Cross of several other orders of high prestige, are often addressed as Excellency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/guidetodiplomati00satouoft |title=Satow, Ernest Mason, Sir - A Guide to Diplomatic Practice |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref>

==Ecclesiastical use==
By a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Ceremonial of 31 December 1930<ref>''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'' 1931, p. 22; ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' 24 January 1931.</ref> the [[Holy See]] granted bishops of the [[Catholic Church]] the title of ''Most Reverend Excellency'' ([[Latin]]: ''Excellentia Reverendissima''). In the years following the [[First World War]], the ambassadorial title of ''Excellency'', previously given to [[nuncio]]s, had already begun to be used by other Catholic bishops. The adjective ''Most Reverend'' was intended to distinguish the religious title from that of ''Excellency'' given to civil officials.

The instruction ''Ut sive sollicite'' of the Holy See's [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], dated 28 March 1969, made the addition of ''Most Reverend'' optional,<ref>[http://catholicsites.org/clericaldress/utsivesollicite.html ''Ut sive sollicite''], 22</ref> sanctioning what had been (except possibly for the beginnings of letters and the like) always the practice.

According to the letter of the decree of 31 December 1930, titular [[Patriarch#Roman Catholicism|patriarchs]] too were to be addressed with the title of ''(Most Reverend) Excellency'', but in practice the Holy See continued to address them with the title of ''Beatitude'', which was formally sanctioned for them with the motu proprio ''Cleri sanctitati'' of 2 June 1957.

[[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]], even those who were bishops, continued to use the title of ''Eminence''.

In some English-speaking countries, the honorific of ''Excellency'' does not apply to bishops other than the nuncio. In English law, [[Anglican]] archbishops are granted the title of ''[[Grace (style)|Grace]]'' (Your Grace, His Grace, as for a duke), and bishops are granted the title of ''[[Lordship]]''. The same titles are extended by courtesy to their Catholic counterparts, and continue in use in most countries that are or have been members of the Commonwealth. An exception is former British East Africa ([[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]]).

== By country ==

=== Albania ===
The [[President of Albania|President]], the [[Chairman of the Parliament of Albania|Chairman of the Parliament]] and the [[Prime Minister of Albania|Prime Minister]] are addressed as "His/Her Excellency".

===Brazil===
In 1991, the [[Brazil]]ian [[President of Brazil|Presidential Office]] issued a composition manual to establish the appropriate usage of the [[Portuguese language]] for all government agencies. The manual states that the title of ''Excelência'' (Excellency) is the proper form used to address the President and [[Vice-President of Brazil|Vice President]], all [[Congresso Nacional|members of Parliament]] and [[judge]]s, among other officials.<ref>[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/manual/manual.htm Manual de Redação da Presidência da República] {{in lang|pt}}</ref>

''His/Her Excellency'', a custom dating from the ancient times wherein the Samrāt and Sāmrājñi (सम्राट, साम्राज्ञी/Emperor,Empress), Generals, Kings, Ambassadors were addressed. A classic example is addressing Devvrat (Bhishma) as महामहिम भीष्म (His/Your Excellency Bhishma) in Mahabharat.

However the Constitution makers approved will discontinue "ancient era" styles of Mahāmahim. The same release states that in [[Hindi|English]] (which is the other language in which subsidiary official communications are released in the Central [[Government of India]] in its capacity of Sahāyak Rājabhāśhā: Subsidiary Officiating language) the style Honourable shall replace the erstwhile His/Her/Your Excellency. The newer style will be ''Honourable'''''.'''

The corresponding changes in releases from the President's Secretariat shall be from Mahāmahim to Rāshtrapatiji.<ref>{{cite web|title=President Approves New Protocol Practice|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=88279|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government or India |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2014|author=President's Secretariat}}</ref> The release also talks about the styles of other dignitaries, like [[governors]]. "Hon'ble" will be used before the titles "president" and "governor", while the traditional honorifics ''[[Sri|Shri]]'' or ''Smt.'' (''Shrimati'') should precede the name.

However, "Excellency" will continue to be used, only for interaction of leaders with foreign dignitaries and foreign dignitaries with our leaders as is customary international practice.

The President can also less formally be addressed as "Mister/Madame President", and "Mister/Madame Vice President" for the Vice President In Filipino, the President may be referred to with the more formal title of "''Ang Mahál na Pangulo''", with "''mahál''" connoting greatness and high social importance.{{refn|group=nb|The [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word "mahál" is often translated as "love" and "expensive", but its original sense has a range of meanings from "treasured" to "the most valuable". It is often applied to royalty, roughly equivalent to the Western "[[Majesty]]" (e.g. ''Mahál na Harì'', "His Majesty, the King"; ''Kamahalan'', "Your Majesty"), and at times used for lower-ranking nobles in the manner of "[[Highness]]", which has the more exact translation of ''Kataás-taasan''. It is also found in religious contexts, such as referring to [[Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[patron saints]], the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] (e.g. ''Ang Mahál na Ina/Birhen''), or [[Christ]] (e.g., ''Ang Mahál na Poóng [[Black Nazarene|Nazareno]]'').}} However, unlike the English honorific, the Vice President is simply addressed "Ang Pangalawang Pangulo" without the honorific "mahal".

The incumbent president, [[Rodrigo Duterte]], has expressed dislike for the traditional title. After assuming office in June 2016, he ordered that the title, along with all honorifics, be dropped from official communications, events, and materials but instead, he be addressed only as "Mayor" since people are already used to calling him as such due to Duterte being the longest-serving [[Mayor of Davao City]] and that his cabinet officials only be addressed as "Secretary". Other government officials followed suit by abandoning use of "The Honorable".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Salaverria|first1=Leila B.|title=Don’t call me 'Your Excellency'|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/798090/dont-call-me-your-excellency|accessdate=19 January 2017|agency=The Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=22 July 2016|language=English}}</ref> However, despite the prior unofficial abandonment, the President continues to be addressed as "Excellency" in formal correspondences and petitions, either verbally or written.

All other local and national government officials are styled "[[The Honorable#Philippines|The Honorable]]"; both titles, however, may be glossed in Filipino as ''Ang Kagalang-galang''.

The [[Swedish language]] title and forms of address are ''Hans/Hennes Excellens'' (His/Her Excellency) and ''Ers Excellens'' (Your Excellency).

During most of the 20th century in [[Sweden]], only three officials (other than foreign ambassadors [[Letter of credence|accredited]] in Sweden and Swedish ambassadors at their post) were granted to the style of ''Excellency'': the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] and the [[Marshal of the Realm (Sweden)|Marshal of the Realm]] (the highest ranking [[courtier]]). They were indeed collectively referred to as "the three excellencies" ({{lang-sv|de tre excellenserna}})<ref>[http://runeberg.org/statskal/1915/0066.html Sveriges statskalender 1915], [[runeberg.org]].

Prior to the 19th century, a [[Lord of the Realm]] ({{lang-sv|En af Rikets Herrar}}) and a member of the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Council of the Realm]] were also entitled to the style as Excellency.

=== Thailand ===
The [[Prime Minister of Thailand]], Deputy Prime Ministers, other cabinet members, governors and ambassadors are addressed as "His/Her Excellency". Meaning in [[Thai language]] of His/Her Excellency is phanahūajaothan (พณหัวเจ้าท่าน หรือ ฯพณฯ).<ref>http://betterenglishforthai.net/etc/mr-president/</ref>

===Turkey===

The [[President of Turkey]] is addressed as "His/Her Excellency".

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], the form ''Excellency'' was commonly used for George Washington during his service as commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]] and later when [[President of the United States]], but it began to fall out of use with [[John Adams|his successor]], and today has been replaced in direct address with the simple ''[[Mr. President (title)|Mr. President]]'' or ''the [[The Honourable#United States of America|Honorable]]''. Diplomatic correspondence to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]], as during the [[Trent Affair]], for instance, frequently referred to him as ''His Excellency''. In many foreign countries and in [[United Nations]] protocol, the President and the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] are usually referred to as ''Excellency.''

The form ''Excellency'' was used for the [[Governor (United States)|governors]] of most of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]], and the practice formally continued after [[American Revolution|independence]].  For example, the term was formerly used in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on the [[Governor of Georgia|state governor]]'s letterhead, the text of [[executive order]]s, any document that requires the governor's signature, and informal settings.  However, in most states the practice fell out of use (or was never introduced) and the title ''[[The Honourable#United States of America|Honorable]]'' is now used instead;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.georgia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Georgia-Protocol-guide-.pdf|title=Georgia Protocol Guide|author=Georgia Department of Economic Development (GDEcD)|website=Georgia Department of Economic Development (Georgia.org)}}</ref> an exception is in reference to the [[Governor of Michigan]], who is traditionally afforded the courtesy title.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michigan Legislature Senate|title=Journal of the Senate of the State of Michigan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8IlAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA167|year=1837|page=1}}</ref> Other governors are sometimes addressed as ''Excellency'' at public events, though it is less common and the product of custom and courtesy rather than of legislation.

Though the U.S. president and U.S. ambassadors are traditionally accorded the style elsewhere, the U.S. government does not use ''Excellency'' for its own chiefs of missions, preferring ''Honorable'' instead.
