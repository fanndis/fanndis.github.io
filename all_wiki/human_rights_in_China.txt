'''Human rights in mainland China''' is periodically reviewed by the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] (UNHRC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/countries/AsiaRegion/Pages/CNIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} China Homepage|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> on which the government of the People's Republic of China and various foreign governments and [[human rights]] organizations have often disagreed. [[Government of the People's Republic of China|PRC authorities]], their supporters, and other proponents claim that existing policies and enforcement measures are sufficient to guard against [[human rights abuses]]. However other countries and their authorities (such as the [[United States Department of State]], [[Global Affairs Canada|Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], among others), international [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), such as [[Human Rights in China (organization)|Human Rights in China]] and [[Amnesty International]], and citizens, lawyers, and [[dissident]]s inside the country, state that the authorities in [[mainland China]] regularly sanction or organize such abuses.

[[Jiang Tianyong]] is the latest lawyer known for defending jailed critics of the [[government]]. In the [[709 crackdown]] which began in 2015, more than 200 lawyers, legal assistants, and activists, including Jiang, were detained.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/another-chinese-human-rights-lawyer-is-going-to-jail/2017/11/20/5af09cbc-ce5d-11e7-8447-3d80b84bebad_story.html China jails yet another human rights lawyer in ongoing crackdown on dissent], November 20th, 2017.

NGOs such as Amnesty International and [[Human Rights Watch]], as well as foreign governmental institutions such as the U.S. State Department, regularly present evidence of the PRC violating the freedoms of [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of movement|movement]], and [[freedom of religion|religion]] of its citizens and of others within its [[jurisdiction]]. Authorities in the PRC claim to define human rights differently, so as to include [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic and social]] as well as political rights, all in relation to "[[Cultural relativism|national culture]]" and the [[developing country|level of development]] of the country.<ref name="xinhuanet human rights">{{Cite news

PRC politicians have repeatedly maintained that, according to the [[PRC Constitution]], the "[[Four Cardinal Principles]]" supersede [[Citizenship Rights|citizenship rights]]. PRC officials interpret the primacy of the Four Cardinal Principles as a legal basis for the arrest of people who the government says seek to overthrow the principles.

Numerous [[China human rights organizations|human rights groups]] have publicized human rights issues in mainland China that they consider the government to be mishandling, including: the death penalty ([[capital punishment]]), the [[one-child policy]] (in which China had made exceptions for [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]] prior to abolishing it in 2015), the political and legal status of [[Tibet]], and neglect of [[freedom of the press]] in [[mainland China]]. Other areas of concern include the lack of legal recognition of human rights and the lack of [[Judicial independence|an independent judiciary]], [[rule of law]], and [[due process]]. Further issues raised in regard to human rights include the severe lack of [[worker's rights]] (in particular the [[Hukou system|''hukou'' system]] which restricts [[Migrant worker|migrant labourers]]' freedom of movement), the absence of independent labour unions (which have since been changing<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acftu.org|script-title=zh:中华全国总工会网站|website=www.acftu.org|language=zh|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref>), and allegations of discrimination against rural workers and [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]], as well as the lack of religious freedom{{spaced ndash}} rights groups have highlighted repression of the [[Christianity in China|Christian]],<ref>{{Cite web

According to the Amnesty International report from 2016/2017 the [[government]] continued to draft and enact a series of new [[national security]] laws that presented serious threats to the protection of human rights. The nationwide crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists continued throughout the year. Activists and human rights defenders continued to be systematically subjected to monitoring, [[harassment]], intimidation, arrest and [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]].<ref name="amnesty.org">[https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/ Amnesty International report from 2016/2017]</ref> The report continues that [[police]] detained increasing numbers of human rights defenders outside of formal detention facilities, sometimes without access to a [[lawyer]] for long periods, exposing the detainees to the risk of [[torture]] and other ill-treatment. Booksellers, [[Publishing|publishers]], activists and a [[journalist]] who went missing in neighboring countries in 2015 and 2016 turned up at detention in China, causing concerns about China's law enforcement agencies acting [[Extrajudicial punishment|outside their jurisdiction]].<ref name="amnesty.org" /> In June 2020, nearly 50 [[United Nations|UN]] independent experts raised wide-ranging concerns over the repression of “[[Fundamental rights|fundamental freedoms]]” by the Chinese government. They highlighted the collective repression of the population, especially religious and ethnic minorities, to the detention of lawyers, prosecution and [[human rights defender]]s. They also denounced "impunity for excessive use of force by police, the alleged use of chemical agents against protesters, the alleged [[sexual harassment]] and assault of women protesters in police stations, and the alleged harassment of health care workers".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/06/1067312|title=Independent UN rights experts call for decisive measures to protect 'fundamental freedoms' in China|accessdate=26 June 2020|website=UN News}}</ref>

==Legal system==
Since the [[Legal history of China#1978-1981|legal reforms]] of the late 1970s and 1980s, the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) has officially moved to embrace the language of the [[rule of law]] and to establish a modern [[Court system of the People's Republic of China|court system]]. In the process, it has enacted thousands of new laws and regulations, and has begun training more [[legal profession]]als.<ref name="HRW Thin Ice"/> The concept of 'rule of law' has been emphasized in the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]], and the ruling party has embarked on campaigns to promote the idea that citizens have protection under the law. At the same time, however, a fundamental contradiction exists in the constitution itself, in which the Communist Party insists that its authority supersedes that of the law.<ref name="fordham">Eva Pils, [http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2065&context=ilj&sei-redir=1#search=%22gao%20zhisheng%20hunger%20strike%22 'Asking the Tiger for His Skin: Rights Activism in China'], Fordham International Law Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4 (2006).</ref> Thus, the constitution enshrines the rule of law, yet simultaneously stresses the principle that the '[[Generations of Chinese leadership|leadership]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]]' holds primacy over the law. Even some Chinese themselves have only a vague conception of the priority of the CCP leadership over constitutional and legal authority.

The judiciary is not [[Judicial independence|independent]] of the Communist Party, and judges face political pressure; in many instances, private party committees dictate the outcome of cases.<ref>{{cite web

====Information hyper-control====

The 2020 World Press Freedom Index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), shows that China is the world's biggest jailers of journalists. Mainland China, which is trying to establish a “new world media order,” maintains its system of information hyper-control, of which the negative effects for the entire world have been seen during the coronavirus public health crisis. It states that the PRC never stops enhancing its system of information hyper-control and persecution of dissident journalists and bloggers, and that further evidence of this came in February 2020, when it arrested two of its citizens for taking it upon themselves to cover the coronavirus crisis. The world's biggest jailer of journalists, China is currently holding around 100, of whom the vast majority are Uyghurs.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-04-19|title=2020 World Press Freedom Index: "Entering a decisive decade for journalism, exacerbated by coronavirus"|url=https://rsf.org/en/2020-world-press-freedom-index-entering-decisive-decade-journalism-exacerbated-coronavirus|access-date=2020-10-13|website=RSF|language=en}}</ref>

The [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]] came to power in the late 1940s and instituted a [[command economy]].

Abolition of this policy has been proposed in 11 provinces, mainly along the developed eastern coast. After a widely publicised incident in 2003, when a university-educated migrant died in Guangdong province, the law was changed in order to eliminate the possibility of summary arrest for migrant laborers.

====Treatment of rural workers====
In November 2005, [[Jiang Wenran]], acting director of the China Institute at the [[University of Alberta]], said that the ''hukou'' system was one of the most strictly enforced [[apartheid]] structures in modern world history.<ref name="Wenran">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4424944.stm|title=China rethinks peasant 'apartheid' |last=Luard|first=Tim|date=10 November 2005|work=BBC News |accessdate=22 August 2008}}</ref> He stated, 'Urban dwellers enjoy a range of social, economic and cultural benefits while peasants, the majority of the Chinese population, are treated like second-class citizens.'<ref name="Wenran" />

===Freedom of association===
{{main|Freedom of association|Labour law|}}
The People's Republic of China does not allow freedom of association in general; in particular, it does not allow a free choice of membership with trade unions and political parties. Under the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), articles 20 and 23, every worker has the right to join an association of their choosing, to have their interests represented against their employer, and to take [[collective action]] including the [[right to strike]]. In China, on a model similar to the [[Deutsche Arbeitsfront]] from 1934 to 1945 in Germany, the [[All-China Federation of Trade Unions]] has a monopoly on union activity: it is effectively a nationalised organisation. This dynamic violates [[International Labour Organization]] Conventions Number [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention|87]] and [[Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949|98]] on freedom of association and collective bargaining. The leadership of the ACFTU is not freely elected by its members, and it is not independent from the state or employers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The CCP effectively monopolises organised political activity in China. There is, therefore, no possibility of genuine electoral competition at any level of government, nor within the Party itself. This violates the UDHR article 21(1), which states, 'Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.'

===Religious freedom===
{{Main|Freedom of religion in China}}

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976), particularly during the [[Four Olds|Destruction of the Four Olds]] campaign, [[Religion in China|religious affairs]] of all types were persecuted, renunciated and strongly discouraged by [[Maoism|Chairman Mao Zedong's government and its ideological allies]]. Many religious buildings were looted or destroyed. Since then, there have been efforts to repair, reconstruct and protect historical and cultural religious sites.<ref>Trevor H.B. Sofield and Li, Fung Mei Sarah:[http://www.istp.murdoch.edu.au/ISTP/casestudies/Case_Studies_Asia/tourchin/tourchin.html China: Tourism Development and Cultural Policies] Annals of Tourism Research, 25 (2), 1998, pp. 362–392.</ref> In its International Religious Freedom Report for 2013, the US Department of State criticized the PRC as follows: 
<blockquote>

The government’s respect for and protection of the right to religious freedom fell well short of its international human rights commitments. (...) The government harassed, detained, arrested, or sentenced to prison a number of religious adherents for activities reported to be related to their religious beliefs and practices. These activities included assembling for religious worship, expressing religious beliefs in public and in private, and publishing religious texts. There were also reports of physical abuse and torture in detention.<ref>United States Department of State, [https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper International Religious Freedom Report for 2013: China], 2013.</ref>

</blockquote>

The 1982 Constitution provides its citizens the right to believe in any religion, as well as the right to refrain from doing so: 
<blockquote>

Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief. No state organization, public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion. The state protects normal religious activities. No one may make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state. Religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html Constitution of the PRC]", ''People''s daily China</ref>

====Tibetan Buddhism ====
The [[Dalai Lama]] is a highly influential figure in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], who has traditionally lived in Tibet. Because of Chinese governmental control over the Tibetan area, the [[14th Dalai Lama|current Dalai Lama]] resides in [[Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh]], in the Republic of India. In [[State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5|a regulation promulgated 3 August 2007]], the Chinese government declared that after 1 September 2007, "[no] living Buddha [may be reincarnated] without government approval, since the Qing dynasty, when the live Buddha system was established."<ref name="permissiontoreincarnate">{{Cite news|url=http://www.religiongonecrazy.com/china-tells-crazy-living-buddhas-to-obtain-permission-before-they-reincarnate/|title=China tells crazy living buddhas to obtain permission before they reincarnate|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>{{Better source|date=July 2020}} The PRC Government-appointed [[Panchen Lama]] is labelled a fake<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/23/AR2006042301349.html|title=World's youngest political prisoner turns 17 | work=The Washington Post | accessdate=2 April 2010 | date=23 April 2006}}</ref> by those who regard the PRC's effort to control organised religion as contradictory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other ethical principles.

Article 36 of the PRC Constitution provides constitutional protection for citizens’ freedom of religion and the country's official ethnic policies also reiterate protection of the freedom of religion of ethnic minorities, but in practice the Uyghur population, predominantly living in the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]], are subject to strict controls on the practice of Islam.<ref name="Treatment of the Uyghur Ethnic Group in the People’s Republic of China">U.S. Department of Justice (March 2015) [http://www.cecc.gov/publications/annual-reports/2008-annual-report ‘Annual Report 2008’]. Retrieved 6 December 2017.</ref>

Examples of these restrictions now include:
*Official religious practices must be held in government-approved mosques
*Uyghurs under 18 years old are not allowed to enter mosques or pray in school
*The study of religious texts is only permitted in designated state schools
*Government informers regularly attend religious gatherings in mosques
*Women are not allowed to wear headscarves and veils and men are not allowed to wear beards
*The use of traditionally Islamic names is banned

Since the [[September 11th attacks]] in 2001, the Chinese government began to label violence in the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] as terrorism, unlike in previous years. Chinese counter-terror legislation now makes explicit links between religion and extremism and has led to regulations that explicitly ban religious expression among Uyghurs in particular.<ref>{{cite news|author=Nicholas Dynon |title=The Language of Terrorism in China: Balancing Foreign and Domestic Policy Imperatives|newspaper= The Jamestown Foundation|date= 9 January 2014| url=https://jamestown.org/program/the-language-of-terrorism-in-china-balancing-foreign-and-domestic-policy-imperatives}}</ref>

Since [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] came to power in 2012, reports have surfaced that around a million Muslims (Chinese citizens and some Central Asian nationals) were detained in [[Xinjiang reeducation camps|re-education camps]] throughout Xinjiang without trial or access to a lawyer.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html|title='Absolutely No Mercy': Leaked Files Expose How China Organized Mass Detentions of Muslims|last1=Ramzy|first1=Austin|date=2019-11-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-16|last2=Buckley|first2=Chris|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In these camps they were 're-educated' to disavow their Islamic beliefs and habitats while praising the Communist Party.

On 19 July 2020, British Foreign Secretary [[Dominic Raab]] accused the PRC of "gross and egregious" human rights abuses against its Uyghur population. He added that while [[United Kingdom|Britain]] wanted good relations with China, it could not stand by the reports of forced sterilization and mass education camps targeting the Uyghur population in [[Xinjiang]]. It is believed that up to a million [[Uyghurs|Uighur]] people have been detained over the past few years in what the Chinese state defines as "re-education camps".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-53463403|title=UK accuses China of 'gross' human rights abuses against Uighurs|accessdate=19 July 2020|website=BBC}}</ref>

On July 24, 2020, two Members of the [[European Parliament]], Hilde Vautmans and Katalin Cseh, wrote a letter to Josep Borrell Fontelles, the Vice President of the European Commission, urging him to punish mainland China for violating the human rights of its Uyghur population and [[Hong Kong]] citizens.

On July 28, 2020, a report documented that the US government and several activist groups mounted pressure on global businesses to reexamine and cut ties with China's [[Xinjiang]] region, where allegations of human rights violations have run rampant for years. The Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the region have been imprisoned in [[Xinjiang re-education camps|re-education camps]] and are forced to work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/28/business/uyghurs-xinjiang-forced-labor-brands-intl-hnk/index.html|title=Activists are urging big brands to eradicate traces of human rights abuse in Xinjiang from their supply chains|accessdate=28 July 2020|website=CNN}}</ref> On August 31, 2020, human rights campaigners requested the US authorities to ban all imports of [[cotton]] from the Chinese province of Xinjiang, due to allegations of widespread [[forced labour]].

[[Freedom House]] rates China as a 6 (the second lowest possible rank) in political freedoms. In 2011, the organization said of the Chinese political leadership:

<blockquote>With a sensitive change of leadership approaching in 2012 and popular uprisings against authoritarian regimes occurring across the Middle East, the ruling Chinese Communist Party showed no signs of loosening its grip on power in 2011. Despite minor legal improvements regarding the death penalty and urban property confiscation, the government stalled or even reversed previous reforms related to the rule of law, while security forces resorted to extralegal forms of repression. Growing public frustration over corruption and injustice fueled tens of thousands of protests and several large outbursts of online criticism during the year. The party responded by committing more resources to internal security forces and intelligence agencies, engaging in the systematic enforced disappearance of dozens of human rights lawyers and bloggers, and enhancing controls over online social media.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2012|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2012/china-0|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=2 April 2012|date=19 March 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

====Independence movements====
[[File:China autonomous regions numbered.svg|thumb|391x391px]]
The [[Secession in China#List of secessionist movements in the People's Republic of China|independence movements in China]] are mainly contained within the Inner Mongolian Regions, the Tibetan region, and the Xinjiang region.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Hyer|first=Eric|date=2005|title=Pan Turkic Nationalism in Xinjiang: A Clash of Civilizations|jstor=41950451|journal=Indian Journal of Asian Affairs|volume=18|issue=1|pages=17–32}}</ref> These regions contain people from ethnic and religious minority groups such as the Mongols, the Tibetans and the Uyghurs.<ref name=":3" />

The Chinese government has had strained relations with these regions since the early 1910s, when the first president of the Chinese Republic, [[Sun Yat-sen]], suggested a plan to move a large number of Han people from Southeast China to Northwest China in an effort to assimilate the ethnic minorities that lived in the area.<ref name=":3" /> While Sun Yat-sen lost political power before he could enforce this plan, his sinocentric, assimilationist attitude was adopted by future leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]].<ref name=":3" /> Chiang Kai-shek enacted educational policy that encouraged cultural assimilation and discouraged self-determinism until 1945, when Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist party became more lenient towards the various ethnic minorities.<ref name=":3" /> From this time until the establishment of the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong, ethnic minorities experienced great independence from the Chinese government, with [[Mongolia]] becoming an independent state in 1921 and Xinjiang being named an autonomous region in 1955.<ref name=":3" />

Tibetan, Mongolian, and Xinjiang independence was severely restricted by the Communist Party in the 1950s under Mao Zedong, with the forced annexation of [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], and [[Xinjiang]] back into mainland China, leading to many protests and riots from the ethnic and religious minorities in the [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]].<ref name=":3" /> From this point onwards, there has been a sustained outpouring of secessionist and independence movements from China's autonomous regions.<ref name=":3" />

Currently, the largest independence struggle is being waged by the Muslim-Turkic population of [[Xinjiang]], which shares minimal cultural, lingual, and historical similarities with the Han population in China.<ref name=":3" /> While the Chinese government under Deng Xiaoping promised to grant some advantages to the population of Xinjiang such as practicing affirmative action in universities, greater liberties with regard to China's [[one-child policy]], and increased government subsidies in the region, the government also discourages and restricts the Muslim-Turkic ethnic population from freely practicing its religion, expressing its faith by wearing head scarves, fasting, growing facial hair, and building mosques freely.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Sautman|first=Barry|s2cid=153771665|date=January 2012|title=Paved with Good Intentions: Proposals to Curb Minority Rights and Their Consequences for China|jstor=23216933|journal=Modern China |volume=38|issue=1|pages=10–39|doi=10.1177/0097700411424563}}</ref> Furthermore, because of the advantages which the Chinese government grants to the people of Xinjiang, many [[Han Chinese]] are prejudiced against them, and their prejudice against the Uyghurs is bolstered by the widespread belief that the government unfairly grants preferential treatment to ethnic minorities in general.<ref name=":4" />

====Political abuse of psychiatry====
[[Political abuse of psychiatry]] began to be practiced in mainland China during the 1950s, shortly after [[Mao Zedong]] established the People's Republic of China, and continues to be practiced in different forms up to present day.<ref name=":05"/> Initially, under Mao Zedong, the practice of psychiatry in China saw legitimate improvements in the breadth and quality of treatments.<ref name=":05">Munro, Robin James. "A question of criminal madness: judicial psychiatry and political dissent in People's Republic of China" PhD. diss., School of Oriental and African Studies (University of London), 2005.</ref> However, as time passed under the direction of [[Mao Zedong]] and the campaign of [[Thought reform in the People's Republic of China|ideological reform]] was implemented, psychiatric diagnoses became used as a way to control and incarcerate Chinese citizens who didn't subscribe to [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideologies such as Marxism–Leninism.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Tobin|first=J.

Political abuse of psychiatry in mainland China peaked from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s.<ref name=":05"/> During this time, Chinese counterrevolutionists and political dissidents were placed into mental asylums, where they were treated with psychotherapy (xinli zhiliao) resembling political indoctrination sessions.<ref name=":13"/> During this time, statistics indicate that there were more political activists being held in mental institutions than the number of rapists, murderers, arsonists, and other violent mentally ill people combined.<ref name=":5" /> The human rights activist [[Wei Jingsheng]] was among the first to speak out about the misappropriation of psychiatry for political purposes in the winter of 1978; however, in response to his advocacy, he was imprisoned and subjected to involuntary drugging and beating by the Chinese government.<ref name=":13"/>&nbsp;

After the end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s, the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes  continually diminished until the 1990s, when there was a resurgence in politically motivated psychiatric diagnoses towards political dissidents and minority religious groups.<ref name=":05"/> During this more recent wave of [[Forensic psychiatry|Chinese forensic psychiatry]], political dissidents and practicers of non-mainstream religions were sent to [[Ankang (asylum)|Ankang (meaning peace and health) hospitals]].<ref name=":23">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ek8BtI3moPMC&q=the+ankang:+china's+special+psychiatric+hospitals+robin+munro&pg=PA117|title=Dangerous Minds: Political Psychiatry in China Today and Its Origins in the Mao Era|last=Munro|first=Robin|date=2002|publisher=Human Rights Watch|isbn=9781564322784|language=en}}</ref> These hospitals, built to hold the criminally insane, are managed by Bureau No. 13 of [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|China's Ministry of Public Security]].<ref name=":05"/> Ankang hospitals have been the target of much scrutiny by human rights activists and organizations both inside and outside of China, and reports indicate inhumane treatment of patients inside these hospitals.<ref name=":23"/> Patients in these hospitals are forced to work at least 7 hours a day and are subjected to torture including acupuncture with electric currents, forced injection of drugs that are known to damage the central nervous system, and physical abuse with ropes and electric batons.<ref name=":23"/> Furthermore, reports by Chinese surgeons at these hospitals report on the use of [[psychosurgery]] on patients who were involuntarily placed in these hospitals to reduce "violent and impulsive behaviors".<ref name=":23"/> One of the most targeted groups of Chinese citizens to be placed in Ankang hospitals are the practicers of [[Falun Gong]], who have what is termed "evil cult-induced mental disorder" or "xiejiao suo zhi jingshen zheng'ai" by Chinese psychiatry.<ref name=":13"/> Over 1000 practitioners have been incarcerated in mental asylums across 23 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions.<ref name=":23"/>

One of the most famous cases of politically motivated psychiatric diagnoses took place in 1992, when [[Wang Wanxing]] was arrested for displaying a pro-democracy banner in Tiananmen Square.<ref name=":23"/> After Wang's arrest, his wife signed a statement confirming his mental instability, because police told her that doing so would ensure Wang's immediate release.<ref name=":23" /> However, Wang was instead placed in the [[Ankang (asylum)|Beijing Ankang hospital]].<ref name=":23" /> He was exiled to Germany in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/dec/20/china.features11|title=In the grip of the Ankang|access-date=2019-08-14|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 December 2005}}</ref>

==Capital punishment==
{{Main|Capital punishment in the People's Republic of China}}

According to Amnesty International, throughout the 1990s more people were executed or sentenced to death in China than in the rest of the world put together.<ref name="Becker" />

Officially, the death penalty in mainland China is only administered to offenders who commit serious and violent crimes, such as [[Aggravation (legal concept)|aggravated murder]], but China retains in law a number of nonviolent death penalty offences such as [[Drug trafficking in China|drug trafficking]]. The People's Republic of China administers more official [[death penalty|death penalties]] than any other country, though other countries (such as Iran and Singapore) have higher official execution rates.<ref name="wp">{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/23/AR2008122302795.html | work=[[The Washington Post]] | title=China's Capital Cases Still Secret, Arbitrary | first1=Maureen | last1=Fan | first2=Ariana Eunjung | last2=Cha | date=24 December 2008 | accessdate=16 August 2010}}</ref> Reliable NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights in China have informed the public that the total execution numbers, with unofficial death penalties included, greatly exceed officially recorded executions; in 2009, the [[Dui Hua Foundation]] estimated that 5,000 people were executed in China – far more than all other nations combined.<ref name="Duihua">Dui Hua Foundation, [http://www.duihua.org/work/publications/nl/nl_pdf/nl_41.pdf 'Reducing Death Penalty Crimes in China More Symbol Than Substance'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017095219/http://www.duihua.org/work/publications/nl/nl_pdf/nl_41.pdf |date=17 October 2015 }}, Dialogue, Issue 40, Fall 2010.</ref> The precise number of executions is regarded as a state secret.

[[Government of the People's Republic of China|PRC authorities]] have recently been pursuing measures to reduce the official number of crimes punishable by death and limit how much they officially utilise the death penalty. In 2011, the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] adopted an amendment to reduce the number of capital crimes from 68 to 55.<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-02/25/c_13750127.htm news.xinhuanet.com Capital crimes dropped]- Retrieved 6 April 2012</ref> Later the same year, the [[Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China|Supreme People's Court]] ordered lower courts to suspend death sentences for two years and to 'ensure that it only applies to a very small minority of criminals committing extremely serious crimes.'<ref name="ibt">International Business Times, [https://archive.today/20120715002031/http://m.ibtimes.com/china-executions-amnesty-intl-151891.html 'China suspends executions for two years'], 25 May 2011.</ref>

The death penalty is one of the classical [[Five Punishments]] of the [[Chinese Dynasties]]. In [[Chinese philosophy]], the death penalty was supported by the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalists]], but its application was tempered by the [[Confucianism|Confucianists]], who preferred rehabilitation over punishment of any sort, including capital punishment.<ref name="Scobell">{{Cite journal|title=The Death Penalty in Post-Mao China|first=Andrew|last=Scobell|journal=[[China Quarterly]]|date=September 1990|pages=503–520|issue=123|doi=10.1017/S0305741000018890|volume=123}}</ref> In Communist philosophy, [[Vladimir Lenin]] urged the retention of the death penalty, whilst [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] claimed that the practice was feudal and a symbol of capitalist oppression. Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party and his government retained the death penalty's place in the legal system, whilst advocating that it be used for a limited number of [[counter-revolutionary|counterrevolutionaries]]. The market reformer [[Deng Xiaoping]] after him stressed that the practice must not be abolished, and advocated its wider use against [[recidivism|recidivists]] and [[Corruption in the People's Republic of China|corrupt officials]]. Leaders of the PRC's [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|minor, non-communist]] parties have also advocated for greater use of the death penalty. Both Deng and Mao viewed the death penalty as having tremendous popular support, and portrayed the practice as a means to 'assuage the people's anger'.<ref name="Scobell" />

The death penalty has widespread support in mainland China, especially for violent crimes, and no group in government or civil society vocally advocates for its abolition.<ref name="Scobell" /> Surveys conducted by the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] in 1995, for instance, found that 95 percent of the Chinese population supported the death penalty, and these results were mirrored in other studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.qq.com/a/20080403/000918_1.htm |script-title=zh:学者称死刑未必公正 政治家应引导民意废除 |date=3 April 2008  |work=青年周末 |accessdate=7 June 2012|language=zh}}</ref> Polling conducted in 2007 in Beijing, [[Hunan]] and [[Guangdong]] found a more moderate 58 percent in favor of the death penalty, and further found that a majority (63.8 percent) believed that the government should release execution statistics to the public.<ref name="Duihua" />

A total of 46 crimes are punishable by death, including some non-violent, [[white-collar crime]]s such as [[embezzlement]] and [[tax fraud]]. Execution methods include lethal injections and shooting.<ref name="amnesty2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcoalition.org/China-reduces-the-number-of-crimes-punishable-by-death-to-46-but-keep-drug-trafficking-in-the-list.html|title=China Reduces the Number of Crimes Punishable by Death to 46, but Keeps Drug Trafficking in the List|last=Plaçais|first=Aurélie|date=7 October 2015|publisher=World Coalition Against the Death Penalty|access-date=27 September 2016}}</ref> The [[People's Armed Police]] carries out the executions, usually at 10:00&nbsp;am.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/11/world/fg-execute11 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Chinese applaud execution of former drug safety chief | first=Mark | last=Magnier | date=11 July 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

Death sentences in post-[[Maoist]] mainland China can be politically or socially influenced. In 2003, a local court sentenced the leader of a [[triad society]] to a death sentence with two years of probation. However, the public opinion was that the sentence was too light. Under public pressure, the supreme court of Communist China took the case and retried the leader, resulting in a death sentence, which was carried out immediately.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-12/23/content_292554.htm|title=Gang leader executed after retrial|date=23 December 2003|accessdate=16 August 2010|work=[[China Daily]]}}</ref>

===Execution protocol===

The execution protocol is defined in criminal procedure law, under article 212:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/criminal-procedure-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-1996.html|title=Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China – 1996|date=17 March 1996|publisher=[[Lehman, Lee & Xu]]}}</ref>

<blockquote>

:Before a people's court executes a death sentence, it shall notify the people's procuratorate at the same level to send personnel to supervise the execution.
:Death sentences shall be executed by means of shooting or injection.
:Death sentences may be executed at the execution ground or in designated places of custody.
:The judicial personnel directing the execution shall verify the identity of the criminal offender, ask him if he has any last words or letters, and then deliver him to the executioner for the death sentence. If, before the execution, it is found that there may be an error, the execution shall be suspended and the matter shall be reported to the Supreme People's Court for decision.
:Execution of death sentences shall be announced to the public, but shall not be held in public.
:The attending court clerk shall, after an execution, make a written record thereon. The people's court that caused the death sentence to be executed shall submit a report on the execution to the Supreme People's Court.
:The people's court that caused the death sentence to be executed shall, after the execution, notify the family of the criminal offender.

</blockquote>

In some areas of mainland China, there is no specific execution ground. A scout team chooses a place in advance to serve as the execution ground. In such a case, the execution ground normally will have three perimeters: the innermost 50{{nbsp}}meters is the responsibility of the execution team; the 200-meter radius from the center is the responsibility of the [[People's Armed Police]]; and the 2-kilometer alert line is the responsibility of the local police. The public is generally not allowed to view the execution.

The role of the executioner was fulfilled in the past by the People's Armed Police. In recent times, the legal police force ({{zh|c=法警|p=fǎ jǐng|links=no}}) assumed this role.

Since 1949, the most common method of execution has been [[execution by firing squad]]. This method has been largely superseded by [[lethal injection]], using the same three-drug cocktail pioneered by [[Capital punishment in the United States|the United States]], introduced in 1996. [[Execution van]]s are unique to mainland China, however. Lethal injection is more commonly used for 'economic crimes' such as corruption, while firing squads are used for more common crimes like murder. In 2010, Chinese authorities moved to have lethal injection become the dominant form of execution; in some provinces and municipalities, it is now the only legal form of capital punishment.<ref>Congressional-Executive Commission on China, [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_house_committee_prints&do 2010 Annual Report], 10 October 2010, p 98.</ref> The Dui Hua foundation notes that it is impossible to ascertain whether these guidelines are closely followed, as the method of execution is rarely specified in published reports.<ref name="Duihua" />

===Criticism===

Human rights groups and foreign governments have heavily criticised the PRC's use of the death penalty for a variety of reasons, including its application for non-violent offences, allegations of the use of torture to extract confessions, legal proceedings that do not meet international standards, and the government's failure to publish statistics on the death penalty.<ref>Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/001/2011/en/ Death Sentences and Executions 2010], 28 March 2011, pp 19 -20.</ref> However, as acknowledged by both the [[Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Supreme Court]] and the [[United States Department of State]], the vast majority of death sentences are given for violent, nonpolitical crimes which would be considered serious in other countries.<ref name="Scobell" />

The [[Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong]] has accused Chinese hospitals of using the organs of executed prisoners for [[Organ transplantation in China|commercial transplantation]].<ref>David Fickling, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/19/china.health?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 China 'using prisoner organs for transplants'], ''The Guardian'', 19 April 2006.</ref> Under Chinese law, condemned prisoners must give written consent to become organ donors, but because of this and other legal restrictions on organ donation, an international [[black market]] in organs and cadavers from China has developed.<ref>Ian Cobain, [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/13/medicineandhealth.china 'The beauty products from the skin of executed Chinese prisoners'], ''The Guardian'', 12 September 2005.</ref><ref>David Barboza, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/08/business/worldbusiness/08bodies.html 'China Turns Out Mummified Bodies for Displays'], The New York Times, 8 August 2006.</ref> In 2009, Chinese authorities acknowledged that two-thirds of organ transplants in the country could be traced back to executed prisoners and announced a crackdown on the practice.<ref>Peter Foster, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/6094228/China-admits-organs-removed-from-prisoners-for-transplants.html 'China admits organs removed from prisoners for transplants'], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 26 August 2009.</ref>

==== United States====
{{Main|Foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration}}
Running for president in 1992, [[Bill Clinton]] sharply criticized his predecessor George H. W. Bush for prioritizing profitable trade relationships over human rights issues in mainland China. As president, 1993–2001, however, Clinton backed away from his position. He did articulate a desired set of goals for mainland China. They included free emigration, no exportation of goods made with prison labor, release of peaceful protesters, treatment of prisoners in terms of international standards, recognition of the distinct regional culture of Tibet, permitting international television and radio coverage, and observation of human rights specified by United Nations resolutions. China refused to comply, and by summer 1994 Clinton admitted defeat and called for a renewal of normalized trade relations. However congressional pressure, especially from Republicans, forced Clinton to approve arms sales to Taiwan, despite the strong displeasure voiced by Beijing' <ref>Yuwu Song, ed., ''Encyclopedia of Chinese-American Relations'' (McFarland, 2009) p 63.</ref>

===Wrongful executions===
An estimate of over 1000 people are executed every year in mainland China. Most of these executions are due to crimes that are seen as intolerable to the society within mainland China and the People's Republic of China. There are some cases that have been held wrongly.<ref name="York, Geoffrey 2005">York, Geoffrey. 2005. "Death-penalty debate grips China after wrongful execution." ''Globe & Mail (Toronto, Canada)'', 2005. ''Biography in Context'', EBSCO''host'' (accessed 24 October 2017).</ref>

At least four people have been considered wrongfully executed by PRC courts.

Wei Qing'an ({{zh|labels=no|c=魏清安}}, circa 1951{{spaced ndash}} 1984) was a Chinese citizen who was executed for the rape of Liu, a woman who had disappeared. The execution was carried out on 3 May 1984 by the Intermediate People's Court. In the next month, Tian Yuxiu ({{zh|labels=no|c=田玉修}}) was arrested and admitted that he had committed the rape. Three years later, Wei was officially declared innocent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.9ask.cn/Article/sdzz/201007/830981.shtml |script-title=zh:魏清安案：法院枪口下还有多少冤案待昭雪？-法治新闻-中顾法律网 |publisher=News.9ask.cn |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref>
Teng Xingshan ({{zh|labels=no|s=滕兴善}}, ?{{spaced ndash}} 1989) was a Chinese citizen who was executed for having raped, robbed and murdered Shi Xiaorong ({{zh|labels=no|s=石小荣}}), a woman who had disappeared. An old man found a dismembered body, and police forensics claimed to have matched the body to the photo of the missing Shi Xiaorong. The execution was carried out on 28 January 1989 by the [[Huaihua]] Intermediate People's Court. In 1993, the missing woman returned to the village, saying she had been kidnapped to Shandong. The absolute innocence of the executed Teng was not admitted until 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sohu.com/20060214/n241816037.shtml |script-title=zh:滕兴善 一个比佘祥林更加悲惨的人-搜狐新闻 |publisher=News.sohu.com |date=2 April 2007 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref>
Nie Shubin ({{zh|labels=no|s=聂树斌}}, 1974{{spaced ndash}} 1995) was a Chinese citizen who was executed for the rape and murder of Kang Juhua ({{zh|labels=no|c=康菊花}}), a woman in her thirties.  The execution was carried out on 27 April 1995 by the [[Shijiazhuang]] Intermediate People's Court. In 2005, ten years after the execution, Wang Shujin ({{zh|labels=no|s=王书金}}) admitted to the police that he had committed the murder. Therefore, it has been indicated that Nie Shubin had been innocent all along.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infzm.com/content/69228 |script-title=zh:南方周末 – 聂树斌案，拖痛两个不幸家庭 |publisher=Infzm.com |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=13 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130104073751/http://www.infzm.com/content/69228 |archive-date=4 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="York, Geoffrey 2005"/>

Although the People's Republic of China outlawed torture in 1996, human rights groups say brutality and degradation are common in Chinese [[arbitrary detention]] centres, [[Re-education through labor|Laojiao]] prisons and [[black jails]]. People who are imprisoned for their political views, human rights activities or religious beliefs have a high risk of being tortured.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34592336|title=Human rights: What is China accused of?|last=Ruz|first=Camila|date=21 October 2015|website=BBC}}</ref>  Strategies of torture inside black jail include deprivation of sleep, food, and medication. The strategies are all quite inhumane conditions. In a specific case, a woman named Huang Yan was imprisoned for her political views and included the deprivation of medication. She had diabetes and ovarian cancer which required her to take medication in order to maintain order.

In May 2010, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|PRC authorities]] officially passed new regulations in an attempt to nullify evidence gathered through violence or intimidation in their official judicial procedures, and to reduce the level of torture administered to prisoners already in jails. Little is known, however, about whether or how procedures were modified in black jails, which are not officially part of the judicial system. The move came after a public outcry following the revelation that a farmer, convicted for murder based on his confession under torture, was in fact innocent. The case came to light only when his alleged victim was found alive, after the defendant had spent ten years in prison.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Farmer released after serving ten years for murder as 'victim' turns up alive|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7121815.ece|work=The Sunday Times |location=UK |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2011 |first=Leo |last=Lewis}}</ref> International human rights groups gave the change a cautious welcome.<ref name="NYTmay2010">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/world/asia/01china.html China Bans Court Evidence Gained Through Torture], ''The New York Times'', 31 May 2010</ref>

There are 55 [[Zhonghua Minzu|officially recognized native ethnic minorities]] in China. Article 4 of the Chinese constitution states 'All nationalities in the People's Republic of China are equal', and the government argues that it has made efforts to improve ethnic education and increased ethnic representation in local government. Some groups are still fighting for recognition as minorities. In the 1964 Census, there were 183 nationalities registered, of which the government recognized 54.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/4954ce5b23.html|title=Refworld – World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – China : Overview|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

The People's Republic of China emphasizes state sovereignty, which at times conflicts with the international norms or standards of human rights.  However, its concept of human rights has developed radically over the years. From 1949 to the late 1970s, the CCP focused on promoting the rights of the masses: collective rights rather than individual human rights. Deng Xiaoping say that the right of a nation, or sovereignty (''guoquan'') is more important than human rights (''renquan''), and right of subsistence (''shengcun quan'') is more fundamental than political freedom.<ref>Gu Chunde and Zheng Hangsheng, eds., ''Renquan, cong shijie dao Zhongguo: dang dai Zhongguo ren quan de li lun yu shi jian'' (Human Rights, From the World to China: The Theories and Practice Studies of Chinese Human Rights Today) (Beijing: Dangjian chubanshe [Party Building Books Publishing House], 1999), pp. 300–1.</ref> However, from the beginning of economic reforms in 1978 to the 1989 Tiananmen incident and democratic movement, the CCP raised concerns for human rights in their domestic and international policies. In 1991, China officially accepted the idea that human rights were compatible with Chinese socialism, and in 1993 the state created the China Society for Human Rights Studies, which has represented Chinese positions on human rights in international forums, conferences, and media. China went on to sign two treaties – the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The ICESCR was ratified by the National People's Congress in 2001, but as of 2016, the ICCPR has not yet been ratified.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ambassdor Wang Yingfan, Permanent Representative of China to UN, today deposited with the Secretary-General China's instrument of ratification for the International Covenant for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|url=http://www.china-un.org/eng/chinaandun/socialhr/rqwt/t26863.htm|website=Permanent Mission of the People's Republic of China to the UN|accessdate=20 April 2016}}</ref> {{as of|2013}}, the PRC had signed more than 20 international treaties on human rights.<ref>China: An international Journal, Volume 9, Number 2, September 2011(China and International Human Rights Diplomacy), pp.223–225</ref>

===Western human rights===

Those who agree with the Chinese Communist Party point towards what they call rapid deterioration in Western societies, claiming that there has been an increase in geographic, religious and racial segregation, rising crime rates, family breakdown, industrial action, vandalism, and political extremism within Western societies. The European Union and the United Nations claim to be stopping these types of human rights violations, save for a few violations committed by some Western governments (e.g. the CIA's [[extraordinary rendition]] programme). The PRC holds the opinion, though, that many alleged negatives about democratic society are a direct result of an excess of individual freedom, saying that [[Chinese skepticism of democracy|too much freedom is dangerous]].<ref>{{Cite journal

The PRC holds that these actions in Western nations are all violations of human rights. They say that these should be taken into account when assessing a country's human rights record. On occasion they have criticised the United States policies, especially the human rights reports published by its State Department. They cite the opinion that the United States, as well as the United Kingdom, has also violated human rights laws, for example during the invasion of Iraq.<ref>{{Cite news

China believes that human rights should encompass what its officials have labelled as "[[Chinese Economy|economic]] standards of living and measures of health and economic prosperity".<ref name="xinhuanet human rights" /> It insists that as economic, cultural, historical and political situations differ substantially between countries, and for that reason [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|international definition of human rights]] cannot apply to China.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Measures taken===
In March 2003, an amendment was officially made to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, officially stating that 'The State respects and preserves human rights.'<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A57447-2004Mar14 China Amends Constitution to Guarantee Human Rights] By Edward Cody</ref> In addition, China was dropped from a list of top ten human rights violators in the annual human rights report released by the U.S. State Department in 2008, though the report indicated that there were still widespread human rights-related issues in the PRC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/washington/12rights.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=U.S.+drops+china&st=nyt&oref=slogin8|title=U.S. Drops China From List of top 10 Violators of Rights|work=The New York Times | first=Helene | last=Cooper | date=12 March 2008 | accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref>

In 1988, the People's Republic of China began direct village elections to help maintain social and political order whilst facing rapid economic change. Elections now occur in about 650,000 villages across China, reaching 75% of the nation's 1.3&nbsp;billion people, according to the Carter Center.<ref>{{cite web
