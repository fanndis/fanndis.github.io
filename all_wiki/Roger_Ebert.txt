'''Roger Joseph Ebert''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|b|ər|t}}; June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013) was an American [[Film criticism|film critic]], film historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author. He was a film critic for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]]. [[Neil Steinberg]] of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' said Ebert "was without question the nation's most prominent and influential film critic,"<ref name=SunTimesObit>{{cite news|last=Steinberg |first=Neil |title=Roger Ebert dies at 70 after battle with cancer |url=http://www.suntimes.com/17320958-761/roger-ebert-dies-at-70-after-battle-with-cancer.html |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=April 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216070113/http://www.suntimes.com/17320958-761/roger-ebert-dies-at-70-after-battle-with-cancer.html |archivedate=December 16, 2014 }}</ref> Tom Van Riper of ''[[Forbes]]'' described him as "the most powerful pundit in America,"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/09/21/pundit-americas-top-oped-cx_tvr_0924pundits.html|title=The Top Pundits in America|work=Forbes|accessdate=December 9, 2008|author=Van Riper, Tom|date=September 24, 2007}}</ref> and [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called him "the best-known film critic in America."<ref name="LA Times death Turan">{{cite news|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title=Remembrance: Roger Ebert, film's hero to the end|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-roger-ebert-appreciation-20130405,0,669989.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 4, 2013}}</ref>

Ebert and ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' critic [[Gene Siskel]] helped popularize nationally televised film reviewing when they co-hosted the [[PBS]] show ''[[Sneak Previews]]'', followed by several variously named ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'' programs. The two verbally sparred and traded humorous barbs while discussing films. They created and trademarked the phrase "two thumbs up," used when both gave the same film a positive review. After Siskel died in 1999, Ebert continued hosting the show with various co-hosts and then, starting in 2000, with [[Richard Roeper]].

Ebert was diagnosed with [[cancer]] of the [[Papillary thyroid cancer|thyroid]] and [[salivary gland cancer|salivary glands]] in 2002. In 2006, he required treatment that included removal of his lower jaw, leaving him severely disfigured and without the ability to speak or eat normally. However, his ability to write remained unimpaired and he continued to publish frequently online and in print until his death on April 4, 2013.

Regarding his early influences in film criticism, Ebert wrote in the 1998 parody collection ''Mad About the Movies'':{{cquote|I learned to be a movie critic by reading ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine&nbsp;...

Ebert began taking classes at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] as an early-entrance student, completing his high school courses while also taking his first university class.<ref>{{cite book|title=Life Itself: A Memoir|last=Ebert|first=Roger|location=New York|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|page=91}}</ref> After graduating from Urbana High School in 1960,<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Milestones in the life of Roger Ebert|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2013-04-05/milestones-life-roger-ebert.html|work=The News-Gazette|location=Champaign, IL|date=April 5, 2013|access-date=January 20, 2019}}</ref> Ebert then attended and received his undergraduate degree in 1964. While at the University of Illinois, Ebert worked as a reporter for ''[[The Daily Illini]]'' and then served as its editor during his senior year while also continuing to work as a reporter for the ''News-Gazette'' of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois.

Ebert spent a semester as a master's student in the department of English there before attending the [[University of Cape Town]] on a Rotary fellowship for a year.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life Itself: A Memoir|last=Ebert|first=Roger|location= New York|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|page=96}}</ref> He returned from Cape Town to his graduate studies at Illinois for two more semesters and then, after being accepted as a PhD candidate at the [[University of Chicago]], he prepared to move to Chicago. He needed a job to support himself while he worked on his doctorate and so applied to the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'', hoping that, as he had already sold freelance pieces to the ''Daily News'', including an article on the death of writer [[Brendan Behan]], he would be hired by editor [[Herman Kogan]]. Instead Kogan referred Ebert to the city editor at the ''Chicago Sun-Times,'' [[James F. Hoge Jr.|Jim Hoge]], who hired Ebert as a reporter and feature writer at the ''Sun-Times'' in 1966.<ref>{{cite book|title=Life Itself: A Memoir|last=Ebert|first=Roger|location=New York |publisher=Grand Central Publishing|page=139}}</ref> He attended doctoral classes at the University of Chicago while working as a general reporter at the ''Sun-Times'' for a year.

==Career==
===Writing===

After he sent her some of his columns, she told him they were "the best film criticism being done in American newspapers today."<ref name=ChicagoMag /> That same year, Ebert's first book, a history of the [[University of Illinois]] titled ''Illini Century: One Hundred Years of Campus Life'', was published by the University's press. In 1969, his review of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670105/REVIEWS/701050301/1023|title = Night of the Living Dead|date = January 5, 1967|website = [[RogerEbert.com]]}}</ref> was published in ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/culture/looking-back-eberts-first-review-in-readers-digest/|title=Looking Back: Ebert's First Review in Reader's Digest|website = [[Reader's Digest]]|date = April 4, 2013|last = Beres|first = Damon|accessdate = December 26, 2016}}</ref> In addition to film, Ebert would occasionally write about other topics for the ''Sun-Times'', such as music; In 1970, Ebert wrote the first published concert review of singer-songwriter [[John Prine]], who at the time was working as a mailman and performing at Chicago folk clubs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=John Prine: American Legend {{!}} Balder and Dash {{!}} Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/john-prine-american-legend |website=www.rogerebert.com |accessdate=30 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Russ Meyer and Roger Ebert by Roger Ebert.jpg|thumb|Ebert (right) with [[Russ Meyer]] in 1970]]
Ebert co-wrote the screenplay for the [[Russ Meyer]] film ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1970) and sometimes joked about being responsible for the film, which was poorly received on its release yet has become a [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19700101/REVIEWS/708110301/1023 |title=Beyond the Valley of the Dolls|work=Chicago Sun-Times |author=Ebert, Roger|accessdate=September 3, 2012|year=1980}}</ref> Ebert and Meyer also made  ''[[Up!

(unfinished film)|Who Killed Bambi?]]'' (In April 2010, Ebert posted his screenplay of ''Who Killed Bambi?'', aka ''Anarchy in the UK'', on his blog.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/who_killed_bambi_-_a_screenpla.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429015727/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/who_killed_bambi_-_a_screenpla.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 29, 2010|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title='Who Killed Bambi?'&nbsp;– A screenplay|website=Chicago Sun-Times|date=April 25, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Beginning in 1968, Ebert worked for the [[University of Chicago]] as an adjunct lecturer, teaching a night class on film at the [[Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2013/04/05/roger-ebert-x-70-film-critic-and-longtime-graham-school-lecturer-1942-2013|title = Roger Ebert, X'70, film critic and longtime Graham School lecturer, 1942–2013|date = April 5, 2013|accessdate = December 26, 2016|website = UChicagoNews|publisher = [[University of Chicago]]}}</ref>

In 1975, Ebert received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]].<ref name="Salt Lake Tribune death" />

In October 1986, while continuing to work for the ''Sun-Times'' and still being based in Chicago, Ebert replaced [[Rex Reed]] as the ''[[New York Post]]'' chief film reviewer.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Ebert Supplants Reed As N.Y.

As of 2007, his reviews were [[print syndication|syndicated]] to more than 200 newspapers in the United States and abroad.<ref name="Corliss2007">{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1636520,00.html|title=Thumbs Up for Roger Ebert|last=Corliss|first=Richard|date=June 23, 2007|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=January 2, 2017}}</ref> Ebert also published more than 20 books and dozens of collected reviews.

Even as he used TV (and later the internet) to share his reviews, Ebert continued to write for the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' until he died in 2013.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQKhAwAAQBAJ&q=write+for+the+Chicago+Sun-Times+until+he+died+in+2013&pg=PA101|title=Obituaries in the Performing Arts, 2013|last=III|first=Harris M.

===TV career===
Also in 1975, Ebert and [[Gene Siskel]] began co-hosting a weekly film-review television show, ''Sneak Previews'', which was locally produced by the Chicago [[public broadcasting]] station [[WTTW]]. The series was later picked up for national syndication on [[PBS]]. The duo became well known for their "thumbs up/thumbs down" review summaries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20129634,00.html|last=Gliatto|first=Tom|title=Despite the Loss of Film-Critic Buddy Gene Siskel, Roger Ebert Gives Life a Thumbs-Up|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date= November 1, 1999}}</ref> Siskel and Ebert trademarked the phrase "Two Thumbs Up."<ref name=Statement />

In 1982, they moved from PBS to launch a similar [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] commercial television show named ''[[At the Movies (1982 TV program)|At the Movies With Gene Siskel & Roger Ebert]]''. In 1986, they again moved the show to new ownership, creating ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel & Ebert & the Movies]]'' through [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]], part of [[the Walt Disney Company]].

After Siskel died in 1999, the producers retitled the show ''Roger Ebert & the Movies'' and used rotating co-hosts including [[Martin Scorsese]], [[A.O. Scott]], and [[Janet Maslin]].

In September 2000, ''Chicago Sun-Times'' columnist [[Richard Roeper]] became the permanent co-host and the show was renamed ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper]]'' and later ''At the Movies''.

In 2000, Ebert interviewed President [[Bill Clinton]] at [[The White House]]. Clinton spoke about his love for the movies, his favorite films of 1999, and of all time which include ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952) and ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956). President Clinton also mentioned his favorite actors being [[Meryl Streep]], [[Robert De Niro]], and [[Tom Hanks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://siskelebert.org/?p=7506|title= The Bill Clinton Interview 2000|website= siskelebert.org|accessdate= July 17, 2020}}</ref>

In 2005, Ebert became the first film critic to receive a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name="Salt Lake Tribune death">{{cite news|last=Rousseau|first=Caryn|title=Roger Ebert, first movie critic to win Pulitzer, dies at 70|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56107300-223/ebert-movie-siskel-chicago.html.csp|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=April 4, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130005857/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56107300-223/ebert-movie-siskel-chicago.html.csp|archivedate=January 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1995, Ebert, along with colleague Gene Siskel, guest-starred on an episode of the animated TV series ''[[The Critic]]''. In the episode, Siskel and Ebert split and each wants Jay as his new partner. The episode is a parody of the film ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tv.com/the-critic/siskel-and-ebert-and-jay-and-alice/episode/53022/summary.html|website = TV.com|title = ''The Critic''&nbsp;– "Siskel & Ebert & Jay & Alice"}}</ref> The following year, Ebert appeared in ''Pitch'', a documentary by Canadian film makers [[Spencer Rice]] and [[Kenny Hotz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125459/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm |title=Pitch (1997) Full cast & crew |website=IMDb|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}</ref> He made an appearance as himself in a 1997 episode of the television series ''[[Early Edition]]'', which took place in Chicago. In the episode, Ebert consoles a young boy who is depressed after he sees a character called Bosco the Bunny die in a movie.<ref name=Questions>{{cite book|title=Questions for the Movie Answer Man|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=June 1, 1997|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|page=[https://archive.org/details/questionsformovi00eber/page/99 99]|isbn=0-8362-2894-4|quote=In the Spring of 1997, I did a guest appearance on the show, consoling a little boy who was depressed that Bosco the Bunny had died.|url=https://archive.org/details/questionsformovi00eber/page/99}}</ref>

In 1999, Roger Ebert founded his own film festival, [[Ebertfest]], in his home town of Champaign, Illinois.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ebertfest.com/about.html|title = About EbertFest|website = [[Ebertfest: Roger Ebert's Film Festival|Roger Ebert's Film Festival]]|accessdate = January 2, 2017|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161229103019/http://www.ebertfest.com/about.html|archivedate = December 29, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> He was also a regular fixture at the [[Hawaii International Film Festival]].

In 2003, Ebert made a cameo appearance in the film ''[[Abby Singer (film)|Abby Singer]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hometheatersound.com/dvd/abby_singer.htm|title = Abby Singer|website = Home Theater & Sound|date = November 2007|accessdate = January 2, 2017}}</ref> On May 4, 2010, Ebert was announced by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences as the Webby Person of the Year, having taken to the internet following his battle with cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/specialachievement14.php |title=The Webby Awards |publisher=The Webby Awards |date=June 14, 2010 |accessdate=April 5, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404205528/http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/specialachievement14.php |archivedate=April 4, 2013 }}</ref> On October 22, 2010, Ebert appeared on camera with [[Robert Osborne]] on the [[Turner Classic Movies]] network during the network's "The Essentials" series. Ebert chose the films ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' and ''[[The Lady Eve]]'' to be shown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/339775%7c0/Critic-s-Choice-TCM-Spotlight-.html|title=Critic's Choice Introduction |author=Fristoe, Roger |publisher=TCM Film Article |accessdate=April 30, 2015}}</ref>

For many years, on the day of the [[Academy Awards]] ceremony, Ebert appeared with Roeper on the live pre-awards show, ''An Evening at the Academy Awards: The Arrivals''. This aired for over a decade, usually prior to the awards ceremony show, which also featured [[red carpet]] interviews and fashion commentary. They also used to appear on the post-awards show entitled ''An Evening at the Academy Awards: The Winners'', produced and aired by the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-owned [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://siskelandebert.org/video/DXY44SAA5M1A/An-Evening-at-the-Academy-Awards-1995 |title=An Evening at the Academy Awards (1995) |publisher=Siskel & Ebert.org |accessdate=April 30, 2015}}</ref>

Ebert was one of the principal critics featured in [[Gerald Peary]]'s 2009 documentary film ''[[For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism]]''. He is shown discussing the dynamics of appearing with Gene Siskel on the 1970s show ''Coming to a Theatre Near You'', which was the predecessor of ''Sneak Previews'' on Chicago PBS station WTTW. He also expressed his approval of the proliferation of young people writing film reviews today on the internet.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=775058| title = For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism''|website = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM Movie Database]]|accessdate = December 16, 2012}}</ref>

Ebert provided DVD [[audio commentary|audio commentaries]] for several films, including ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'', ''[[Floating Weeds]]'', ''[[Crumb (film)|Crumb]]'', and ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]'' (for which Ebert also wrote the screenplay, based on a story that he co-wrote with [[Russ Meyer]]). Ebert was also interviewed by [[Central Park Media]] for an extra feature on the DVD release of the [[anime]] film ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]''. Ebert appeared as a guest star multiple times on ''[[Sesame Street]]''. A bio-documentary about Ebert, called ''[[Life Itself (2014 film)|Life Itself]]'', was released in 2014 to universal acclaim.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/life_itself/ | title=Life Itself | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=September 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/life-itself | title=Life Itself Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=July 19, 2014}}</ref>

Though not making a personal appearance, an honorary effigy of Ebert co-starred in the [[Godzilla (1998 film)|1998 reimagined version of]] ''[[Godzilla]]'', played by actor [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as New York City Mayor Ebert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/godzilla-1998|title = Godzilla (1998) Movie Review & Film Summary|date = May 26, 1998|accessdate = January 2, 2017|last = Ebert|first = Roger}}</ref>

==Critical style==
Ebert described his critical approach to films as "relative, not absolute"; he reviewed a film for what he thought it would be to its prospective audience, yet always with at least some consideration as to its value as a whole. He awarded four stars to films of the highest quality, and generally a half star to those of the lowest, unless he considered the film to be "artistically inept and morally repugnant," in which case it received no stars.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/death-wish-ii-1982|title=''Death Wish II'' review by Roger Ebert|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=November 24, 2020|date=January 1, 1982}}</ref>

{{cquote|When you ask a friend if ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]'' is any good, you're not asking if it's any good compared to ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'', you're asking if it's any good compared to ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]''. And my answer would be, on a scale of one to four, if ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' is four, then ''Hellboy'' is three and ''The Punisher'' is two. In the same way, if ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' gets four stars, then ''[[The United States of Leland]]'' clocks in at about two.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040423/REVIEWS/404230305/1023|title = ''Shaolin Soccer'' Movie Review & Film Summary|date = April 23, 2004}}</ref>}}

[[Metacritic]] later noted that Ebert tended to give more lenient ratings than most critics. His average film rating was 71%, if translated into a percentage, compared to 59% for the site as a whole. Of his reviews, 75% were positive and 75% of his ratings were better than his colleagues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/remembering-roger-ebert|website=[[Metacritic]]|title=Remembering Roger Ebert: His reviews}}</ref> Ebert had acknowledged in 2008 that he gave higher ratings on average than other critics, though he said this was in part because he considered a rating of 3 out of 4 stars to be the general threshold for a film to get a "thumbs up."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/you-give-out-too-many-stars|title=Roger Ebert: You Give Out Too May Stars}}</ref> Although Ebert rarely wrote outright-scathing reviews, he had a reputation for writing memorable ones for the films he really disliked, such as ''[[North (1994 film)|North]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/2957019/roger-ebert-life-itself-brutal-reviews/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=7 of Roger Ebert's most brutal movie reviews|date=July 4, 2014|accessdate=October 20, 2017}}</ref>

Ebert emphasized that his star ratings had little meaning if not considered in the context of the review itself. Occasionally, Ebert's star rating may have seemed at odds with his written opinion. Ebert acknowledged one such case in his review of ''[[Basic Instinct 2]]'', which he gave 1.5 stars, and about which he wrote "I cannot recommend the movie, but&nbsp;... why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that of staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring, ''that'' would be a reason."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060330/REVIEWS/60323008 |title = ''Basic Instinct 2'' Movie Review & Film Summary|date = March 21, 2006}}</ref> In his review of ''[[The Manson Family (film)|The Manson Family]]'', Ebert gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that did not count as a recommendation ''per se''. He similarly gave the [[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|Adam Sandler–starring remake]] of ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'' a positive rating of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the [[Cannes Film Festival]], he recommended readers not to see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050526/REVIEWS/50510003/1023 |title=Ebert's review of ''The Longest Yard'' (2005 version) at rogerebert.com; May 27, 2005 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |date=May 26, 2005}}</ref> He declined to give a star rating to ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)|The Human Centipede]]'', arguing that the rating system was "unsuited" to such a film: "Is the movie good?

In his appearances on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', he was frequently challenged to defend his ratings. Ebert stood by his opinions with one notable exception: when Stern pointed out that Ebert had given ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' a three-star rating in 1974, but had subsequently given ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' three and a half stars. Ebert later added ''The Godfather Part II'' to his "Great Movies" list in October 2008 stating that his original review has often been cited as proof of his "worthlessness" but he still had not changed his mind and would not change a word of his original review.<ref name="ebertgm">{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=The Godfather, Part II review|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=October 2, 2008|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081002/REVIEWS08/810020300/1023|accessdate=February 28, 2010 }}</ref> When reviewing the [[The Last House on the Left (2009 film)|2009 remake of ''The Last House on the Left'']], Ebert noted how he had given the [[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|controversial 1972 original]] three and a half stars and declined to make a comparison between the two versions: "I wrote that original 'Last House' review 37 years ago.

Ebert revisited and sometimes revised his opinions. After ranking ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' third on his 1982 list, it was the only movie from that year to appear on his later "Best Films of the 1980s" list (where it also ranked third).<ref name = ListArchive>{{cite web|url = http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/ebert.html#best80s|title = Roger Ebert's Top Ten Lists, 1967-2006|website = Eric C.

In 2006, Ebert noted his own "tendency to place what I now consider the year's best film in second place, perhaps because I was trying to make some kind of point with my top pick,"<ref>{{cite book|last = Ebert| first = Roger|title = Awake in the Dark|url = https://archive.org/details/awakedarkbestrog00eber|url-access = limited|publisher = University of Chicago Press|date = 2006|page = [https://archive.org/details/awakedarkbestrog00eber/page/n139 103]}}</ref> adding, "In 1968, I should have ranked ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey|2001]]'' above ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]''.  In 1971, ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' was better than ''[[The Last Picture Show]]''.  In 1974, ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' was probably better, in a different way, than ''[[Scenes from a Marriage]]''.  In 1976, how could I rank ''[[Small Change (film)|Small Change]]'' above ''[[Taxi Driver]]''?  In 1978, I would put ''[[Days of Heaven]]'' above ''[[An Unmarried Woman]]''. And in 1980, of course, ''[[Raging Bull]]'' was a better film than ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]''&nbsp;... although I later chose ''Raging Bull'' as the best film of the entire decade of the 1980s, it was only the second-best film of 1980&nbsp;... am I the same person I was in 1968, 1971, or 1980? I hope not."

Ebert was often critical of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]] (MPAA). His main arguments were that they were too strict on sex and profanity, too lenient on violence, secretive with their guidelines, inconsistent in applying them and not willing to consider the wider context and meaning of the film.<ref name="uglyreality">{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/ugly-reality-in-movie-ratings|title=Ugly reality in movie ratings|publisher=[[RogerEbert.com]]|date=September 24, 2000|accessdate=May 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703766704576009343432436296 |title=Getting Real About Movie Ratings|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=December 11, 2010 |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref> He advocated replacing the [[NC-17]] rating with separate ratings for pornographic and nonpornographic adult films.<ref name="uglyreality"/>

Ebert also frequently lamented that cinemas outside major cities are "booked by computer from Hollywood with no regard for local tastes," making high-quality independent and foreign films virtually unavailable to most American moviegoers.<ref>{{cite web|author = Ebert, Roger|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/oscars/ebert27.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604184449/http://www.suntimes.com/output/oscars/ebert27.html|archivedate=June 4, 2004 |date=June 4, 2004 |title=They got it right|website = Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>

Some [[horror movie]] fans accused Ebert of elitism and prejudice against the horror genre, especially because of his dismissive comments about "Dead Teenager Movies."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horrorreview.com/essay/egebertsax2007.html |author=Gurnow, Michael |title=Roger Ebert's Bloody Ax: An Examination of the Film Critic's Elitist Dismissal of the Horror Film |publisher=The Horror Review |year=2007 |accessdate=October 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907143231/http://www.horrorreview.com/essay/egebertsax2007.html |archivedate=September 7, 2008 }}</ref> In 2007, Ebert responded to a question from a horror movie reviewer by saying that he did not disparage horror movies as a whole. He wrote that he drew a distinction between films like ''[[Nosferatu]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', which he regarded as "masterpieces," and those that had no content other than teenagers being killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/dead-teenage-wasteland|title=Roger Ebert, Dead Teenage Wasteland|date=June 29, 2007|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref>

Ebert occasionally accused some films of having an unwholesome political agenda, such as his assertion that the film ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971) had a [[fascism|fascist]] moral position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dirty-harry-1971|title = Dirty Harry Movie Review and Film Summary|last = Ebert| first = Roger|year = 1971|accessdate = January 2, 2017}}</ref> He was wary of films passed off as art, which he saw as lurid and sensational.

===Other interests===
Ebert was an admirer of director [[Werner Herzog]], whom he supported through many years when Herzog's popularity had declined. He conducted an onstage public "conversation" with Herzog at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] in 2004, after a screening of Herzog's film ''[[Invincible (2001 drama film)|Invincible]]'' at [[Ebertfest|Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival]]. Herzog dedicated his film ''[[Encounters at the End of the World]]'' (2008) to Ebert, and Ebert responded with a heartfelt public letter of gratitude.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071117/PEOPLE/71117002 |title=Roger Ebert.

Ebert was also an advocate and supporter of Asian-American cinema, famously coming to the defense of the cast and crew of [[Justin Lin]]'s ''[[Better Luck Tomorrow]]'' (2002) during a [[Sundance Film Festival]] screening when a white member of the audience asked how Asians could be portrayed in such a negative light and how a film so empty and amoral could be made for Asian-Americans and Americans. Ebert responded that "nobody would say such a thing to a bunch of white filmmakers: How could you do this to 'your people'?&nbsp;... Asian-American characters have the right to be whoever the hell they want to be. They do not have to represent 'their people'!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/festivals/737/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311235020/http://www.filmthreat.com/festivals/737/|archivedate=March 11, 2015 |date=January 19, 2012|website = [[Film Threat]]|title = When Audiences Attack at Sundance}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last = Davis|first = Erik|url=http://www.movies.com/movie-news/about-that-time-roger-ebert-fought-heckler-over-justin-lin39s-39better-luck-tomorrow39/11338?wssac=164&wssaffid=news |title=About That Time Roger Ebert Fought a Heckler over Justin Lin's 'Better Luck Tomorrow|website= Movies.com|accessdate= January 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last = Harris|first = Dana|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/this-video-shows-exactly-what-we-lost-with-the-death-of-roger-ebert|title=This Video Shows Exactly What We Lost With the Death of Roger Ebert| website=[[IndieWire]]}}</ref> He was a supporter of the film after the incident at Sundance, and also supported a number of Asian-American films, having them also screen at his film festival (such as [[Eric Byler]]'s ''[[Charlotte Sometimes (film)|Charlotte Sometimes]]'').<ref>{{cite web|author=Ebert, Roger|url=http://www.charlottesometimesthemovie.com/ebert.html|title='Sometimes' a Great Notion|website = Charlotte Sometimes the Movie|accessdate = January 27, 2017}}</ref>

===Views on technology===
Ebert was a strong advocate for [[Maxivision]] 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, as compared to the usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theaters lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060219/ANSWERMAN/602190302/1023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420012335/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060219%2FANSWERMAN%2F602190302%2F1023|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 20, 2007|title=Ebert's "Movie Answer Man column", February&nbsp;19, 2006|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=October 17, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Ebert was skeptical of the resurgence of [[3D film|3D effects in film]], which he found unrealistic and distracting.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/08/dminus_for_3d.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817035951/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/08/dminus_for_3d.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 17, 2008|title=D-minus for 3-D|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]: Blogs|date=August 16, 2008|accessdate=October 17, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2005, Ebert opined that video games are not art, and are inferior to media created through authorial control, such as film and literature, stating, "video games can be elegant, subtle, sophisticated, challenging and visually wonderful," but "the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art."<ref>{{cite web|author = Ebert, Roger|url = http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-genders |title = Why did the chicken cross the genders? |website = [[RogerEbert.com]]|date = November 27, 2005}}</ref> This resulted in negative reaction from video game enthusiasts,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051206/COMMENTARY/51206002|author=Ebert, Roger|title=Gamers fire flaming posts, e-mails&nbsp;... |date=December 6, 2005|publisher=[[RogerEbert.com]]/Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> such as writer [[Clive Barker]], who defended [[video games as an art form]].
