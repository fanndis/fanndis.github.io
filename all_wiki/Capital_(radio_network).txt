'''Capital FM''' is a network of twelve [[Independent Local Radio|independent]] [[contemporary hit radio]] stations in the United Kingdom, broadcasting a mix of local and networked programming. Nine of the stations are owned and operated by [[Global (company)|Global]], while the other three are owned and operated under separate franchise agreements.<ref>[http://www.maclaurinmedia.com/blog/uk_tunes_into_capital_fm/ UK Tunes into Capital FM] MacLaurin Media, 4 January 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320140115/http://www.maclaurinmedia.com/blog/uk_tunes_into_capital_fm/ |date=20 March 2012 }}</ref>

==History==
{{further2|[[Capital London]], [[The One Network|One]], [[Galaxy (radio network)|Galaxy]], [[The Hit Music Network|Hit Music]], [[Timeline of Capital Radio]]}}

===Capital Radio, GWR and GCap Media===
Capital started as the independent music radio station for London in the early 1970s.

In the 1990s, Capital Radio became one of the UK's major radio groups via acquisition of a number of local radio stations including [[Red Dragon FM]], [[BRMB]] and [[Power FM]]. Rival [[GWR Group]] also acquired a number of local radio stations in the 1990s, including [[Leicester Sound]], [[Ram FM]], [[GWR FM]], [[Chiltern FM]], [[Hereward FM]], [[Marcher Sound]] and [[Trent FM]], which operated as part of the 33-station Mix network.

Capital Radio and GWR Group's merger in 2005 to form [[GCap Media]] resulted in the stations being amalgamated into the [[The One Network|One Network]]. This continued until June 2009 when most of the stations, now in the ownership of [[Global Group|Global Radio]], who had purchased GCap in 2008, were rebranded as part of [[The Heart Network]]. This left [[Leicester Sound]], [[Ram FM]], [[Red Dragon FM]] and [[Trent FM]] which formed [[The Hit Music Network|Hit Music]] with network content produced in [[Nottingham]]. In January 2011, these stations were rebranded as part of Capital, with the Leicester, Derby and Nottingham stations merged to form one regional station for the East Midlands.

===Galaxy===
The first Galaxy radio station, Galaxy 97.2, was launched in 1990 in [[South West England]] – initially broadcasting solely from [[Bristol]] – and operated under the [[Chiltern Radio Group]]. In 1994 the station won the first regional FM licence and moved frequency to 101.0&nbsp;MHz, rebranded as [[Galaxy 101]] and expanded coverage to include [[South Wales]]. At the same time a second studio was opened in [[Cardiff]] to provide some programming alongside the existing Bristol studio. [[Chrysalis Radio]] purchased the station in 1996 and, a year later, expanded the network by buying [[Faze FM]]'s stations: [[Kiss 102]] in Manchester and [[Kiss 105]] in Yorkshire. In 1998, black community station [[Capital XTRA|Choice FM]] was acquired in Birmingham. Chrysalis Radio won the North East regional licence in 1999 and sold the original station, Galaxy 101, to the [[GWR Group]] in 2002 (this station is now [[Kiss 101]]).

In 2007, Chrysalis Radio was sold to Global Radio and following their subsequent acquisition of GCap in 2008, [[Capital Scotland|XFM Scotland]] and [[Capital South Coast|Power FM]] were rebranded under the Galaxy moniker in November 2008. Another rebrand followed in January 2011 when all Galaxy stations were rebranded as Capital.

===Capital===
Within the first five months of the network, [[Capital London|Capital's flagship London station]] regained its position as the most listened-to commercial station in London. However, [[Capital Manchester|Manchester]], [[Capital North East|the North East]], [[Capital South Wales|South Wales]] and [[Capital Yorkshire|Yorkshire]] lost listeners, contrasting with [[Capital Birmingham|Birmingham]], [[Capital Scotland|Central Scotland]] and [[Capital South Coast|the South Coast]] where listening figures increased.<ref>[http://radiotoday.co.uk/2011/05/global-capital-fm-back-at-1/ GLOBAL: Capital FM back at #1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221355/http://radiotoday.co.uk/2011/05/global-capital-fm-back-at-1/ |date=4 October 2013 }} Radio Today, 12 May 2011</ref>

On 1 July 2011, [[Global Group|Global Radio]] requested changes to the formats of [[Capital Birmingham]] and [[Capital Scotland]], which had inherited obligations from previous owners. This was to enable format consistency within all nine Capital stations.<ref>[http://radiotoday.co.uk/2011/07/global-requests-capital-fm-format-change/ Global requests Capital format change] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224535/http://radiotoday.co.uk/2011/07/global-requests-capital-fm-format-change/ |date=4 October 2013 }} Radio Today, 1 July 2011</ref> On 17 November 2011, [[Ofcom]] approved both format change requests.<ref>[http://radiotoday.co.uk/2011/11/ofcom-approves-capital-format-change/ Ofcom approves Capital format change] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121212243/http://radiotoday.co.uk/2011/11/ofcom-approves-capital-format-change/ |date=21 November 2011 }} Radio Today, 17 November 2011</ref>

On 6 February 2014, Global Radio announced it would be selling two of its Capital stations – in Scotland and South Wales – to [[Communicorp]]. Capital's network programming and brand name is still used by both stations under contract.<ref>{{cite web |last=Martin |first=Roy |url=http://radiotoday.co.uk/2014/02/communicorp-buys-8-global-radio-stations/ |title=Communicorp buys 8 Global stations |publisher=RadioToday |date=6 February 2014 |access-date=6 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209042821/http://radiotoday.co.uk/2014/02/communicorp-buys-8-global-radio-stations/ |archive-date=9 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Two ex-[[Heart (radio network)|Heart]] stations were added to the network on 6 May 2014: [[Capital Cymru]] (serving Anglesey and Gwynedd) and [[Capital North West and Wales]], broadcasting from Wrexham.

On 18 January 2016, Global added the former [[Juice FM]] station in [[Liverpool]] to the network, after approval was given to buy the station from [[UTV Media]] for £10 million.<ref>[http://radiotoday.co.uk/2015/10/global-confirms-capital-to-launch-in-liverpool/ Global confirms Capital to launch in Liverpool] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006142646/http://radiotoday.co.uk/2015/10/global-confirms-capital-to-launch-in-liverpool/ |date=6 October 2015 }}, Radio Today, 5 October 2015</ref>

In January 2018, Global added the former [[Juice 107.2]] in [[Brighton]] and announced it would launch Capital Brighton on 3 September 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radiotoday.co.uk/2018/08/capital-brighton-to-launch-on-3rd-september/|title=Capital Brighton to launch on 3rd September – ''RadioToday''|work=[[Radio Today (website)|Radio Today]]|access-date=14 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802162636/https://radiotoday.co.uk/2018/08/capital-brighton-to-launch-on-3rd-september/|archive-date=2 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 2019, following Ofcom's decision to relax local content obligations from commercial radio, it was announced Capital would replace its local breakfast and weekend shows with additional networked programming from London as of Monday 8 April 2019. This reduces total weekly hours of local programming on each station from 43 to 15.<ref>[https://radiotoday.co.uk/2019/02/global-to-network-capital-heart-and-smooth-breakfast-shows/ Global to network Capital, Heart and Smooth breakfast shows] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227060209/https://radiotoday.co.uk/2019/02/global-to-network-capital-heart-and-smooth-breakfast-shows/ |date=27 February 2019 }}, RadioToday, 26 February 2019</ref>

==Production and programming==
Capital stations based in [[Capital Scotland|Central Scotland]] and [[Capital Birmingham|Birmingham]] produced and transmitted specialist output for the network on Saturday and Sunday overnights respectively. However, in July 2012, this was replaced with content from 95.8 Capital studios in [[Leicester Square]], London, where all the networked programming is now produced. Breakfast and drive-time shows on weekdays and weekend afternoons are produced and broadcast from local stations' studios.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/article/1028137/global-radio-takes-capital-national |title=Media Week: Global radio takes Capital national |access-date=3 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004223455/http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/article/1028137/global-radio-takes-capital-national |archive-date=4 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Capital also broadcasts via a number of DAB ensembles that do not correspond with a local FM station, and as an audio channel on the Digital Terrestrial Television and Digital Satellite platforms. These platforms take a national feed with programming (except adverts) identical to that of 95.8 Capital London.

Prior to January 2011, Leicester Sound, Ram FM and Trent FM shared off-peak programming from Trent's studios in [[Nottingham]], whilst [[Galaxy (radio network)|Galaxy]] programming came from studios in [[Leeds]], Yorkshire. Red Dragon FM and Capital were entirely autonomous, producing all of their own output.

The Capital radio network production and station sound was created by former Capital producer Arden Hanley<ref>[http://www.radiotalent.co.uk/ardenhanley Arden Hanley at Radio Talent] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226052021/http://www.radiotalent.co.uk/ardenhanley |date=26 February 2011 }}</ref> and was then overseen by Chris Nicoll, who also runs production brand Wizz FX, until his departure in 2015 to join Wise Buddah.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.radiotalent.co.uk/chrisnicoll |title=Chris Nicoll at Radio Talent |access-date=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211121901/http://www.radiotalent.co.uk/chrisnicoll |archive-date=11 December 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Howard Ritchie,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.radiotalent.co.uk/howardritchie |title=Howard Ritchie at Radio Talent |access-date=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517090109/http://www.radiotalent.co.uk/howardritchie |archive-date=17 May 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Helen Austin<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.helenaustin.co.uk/ |title=Helen Austin |access-date=3 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005013504/http://www.helenaustin.co.uk/ |archive-date=5 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> and Kayne Harrison are the voiceover artists for 96-107 Capital.

==Help a Capital Child==
The Capital London charity ''Help a London Child'' was founded in 1975 by [[Richard Attenborough]] CBE. It is a grant-giving charity which means that twice a year, the charity provides practical and lasting support to groups working with thousands of youngsters aged 18 and under.

In the first year, £8,000 was raised and grants given to 10 charities in Camden. Since its formation, the charity has raised in excess of £22 million in the London area and awarded grants to areas of great need, directly helping over 1.4 million children and young people.

Grants are awarded to refuge and homelessness projects, support groups for children and young people with a disability, special need or an illness, as well as a range of sports, music, drama and leisure activities, holiday play schemes and residential breaks in the UK, cultural activities, supplementary schools, literacy programmes and much more.

It was the winner of Outstanding Contribution to London Lifestyle at the London Lifestyle Awards in 2010. In the same year, the charity allocated a record amount in grants (£1.6 million), supporting 84,000 children and young people across London where "you're never more than one mile away from a project supported by Help a Capital Child".

Help a Capital Child was launched as the main charity of the Capital Network. The first annual event took place from 14–16 October 2011 with sister station [[LBC 97.3]] also adopting the charity appeal.
