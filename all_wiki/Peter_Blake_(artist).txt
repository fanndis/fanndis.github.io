== Career ==
[[File:Blake, On the Balcony.jpg|thumb|''On the Balcony'', 1955–1957, [[Tate Gallery]]]]
During the late 1950s, Blake became one of the best known British [[pop art]]ists. His paintings from this time included imagery from advertisements, [[music hall]] entertainment, and [[wrestling|wrestlers]], often including [[collage]]d elements. Blake was included in group exhibitions at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] and had his first solo exhibition in 1960. In the "Young Contemporaries" exhibition of 1961 in which he exhibited alongside [[David Hockney]] and [[R. B. Kitaj]], he was first identified with the emerging British Pop Art movement. Blake won the (1961) John Moores junior award for ''Self Portrait with Badges''. He came to wider public attention when, along with [[Pauline Boty]], [[Derek Boshier]] and [[Peter Phillips (artist)|Peter Phillips]], he featured in [[Ken Russell]]'s ''[[Monitor (UK TV series)|Monitor]]'' film on pop art, ''Pop Goes the Easel'', broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC television]] in 1962. From 1963, Blake was represented by [[Robert Fraser (art dealer)|Robert Fraser]] placing him at the centre of [[swinging London]] and brought him into contact with leading figures of popular culture. His ''Captain Webb Matchbox'' piece is another of his works in the pop art movement.<ref name="pop art" />

== Work ==
''On the Balcony'' (1955–1957) is a significant early work which remains an iconic piece of British Pop Art, showing Blake's interest in combining images from pop culture with fine art. The work, which appears to be a collage but is wholly painted, shows, among other things, a boy on the left of the composition holding [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Balcony (painting)|The Balcony]]'', badges and magazines. It was inspired by a painting by [[Honoré Sharrer]] depicting workers holding famous paintings, ''Workers and Paintings''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=78465|title=Honoré Sharrer. Workers and Paintings. 1943 – MoMA|work=The Museum of Modern Art}}</ref> At the "Pop Art in Changing Britain" exhibit and as reported by ''The Telegraph'' on 21 February 2018, his ''Girls with Their Hero'', a 1959 painting of facets of [[Elvis Presley]] was said to have "fashioned a highly personal form of Pop Art, infused by nostalgia for Victoriana and a long-lost world of native pastimes". Blake has referred to the work of other artists many times. Another example, ''The First Real Target'' (1961) a standard [[archery]] target with the title written across the top is a play on paintings of targets by [[Kenneth Noland]] and [[Jasper Johns]].

Blake painted several album sleeves. He designed the sleeve for ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' with his wife [[Jann Haworth]], the American-born artist whom he married in 1963 and divorced in 1979. The Sgt. Pepper's sleeve has become an iconic work of pop art, much imitated and Blake's best-known work. Producing the collage necessitated the construction of a set with cut-out photographs and objects, such as flowers, centred on a drum (sold in auction in 2008) with the title of the album. Blake has subsequently complained about the one-off fee he received for the design (£200<ref>{{cite news| url =https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/jun/17/art2| title =Blake's progress| last1 =Barber| first1 =Lynn| date = 17 June 2007| newspaper =[[The Guardian]] | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141005005634/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/jun/17/art2| archive-date =2014-10-05| url-status=live| accessdate =6 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Anthony|last=Barnes | title=Where's Adolf?

Blake made sleeves for the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] single, "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" (1984), [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]]'s ''[[Stanley Road]]'' (1995) and the [[Ian Dury]] tribute album ''[[Brand New Boots and Panties]]'' (2001; Blake was Dury's tutor at the [[Royal College of Art]] in the mid-60s). He designed the sleeves for [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]]'s ''[[Sweet Child]]'', [[The Who]]'s ''[[Face Dances]]'' (1981), which features portraits of the band by a number of artists, and 38 years later, [[The Who]]'s ''[[Who (album)|WHO]]'' (2019).

In 1969, Blake left London to live near Bath. His work changed direction to feature scenes based on English Folklore and characters from Shakespeare. In the early 1970s, he made a set of [[watercolour]] paintings to illustrate [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' using a young artist, Celia Wanless, as the model for Alice and in 1975 he was a founder of the [[Brotherhood of Ruralists]]. Blake moved back to London in 1979 and his work returned to earlier popular culture references.

In 1990 and 1991, Blake painted the artwork to [[Eric Clapton]]'s 1991 million-selling [[live album]] ''[[24 Nights]]''. A scrapbook featuring all of Blake's drawing was later released. In January 1992, Blake appeared on BBC2's acclaimed "Arena" Masters of the Canvas documentary and painted the portrait of the wrestler [[Kendo Nagasaki]].

In June 2006, as The Who returned to play Leeds University 36 years after recording their seminal ''Live at Leeds'' album in 1970, Blake unveiled a ''Live at Leeds 2'' artwork to commemorate the event. The artist and The Who's Pete Townshend signed an edition which will join the gallery's collection. More recently, Blake has created [[Edition (printmaking)|artist's editions]] for the opening of the [[Pallant House Gallery]] which houses collections of his most famous paintings. The works are homages to his earlier work on the ''Stanley Road'' album cover and Babe Rainbow prints. He designed a series of deck chairs.

In 2006, Blake designed the cover for [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] greatest hits album ''[[Stop the Clocks]]''. According to Blake, he chose all of the objects in the picture at random, but the sleeves of ''Sgt. Pepper's'' and ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' were in the back of his mind. He claims, "It's using the mystery of ''Definitely Maybe'' and running away with it." Familiar cultural icons which can be seen on the cover include [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|Wizard of Oz]]'', [[Michael Caine]] (replacing the original image of [[Marilyn Monroe]], which could not be used for legal reasons) and the seven dwarfs from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. Blake revealed that the final cover wasn't the original which featured an image of the shop 'Granny Takes a Trip' on the [[Kings Road]] in [[Chelsea, London]].

Blake created an updated version of ''Sgt. Pepper''—with famous figures from Liverpool history—for the campaign for Liverpool to become [[European Capital of Culture|European Capital of Culture in 2008]], and is created a series of prints to celebrate Liverpool's status.<ref>Mike Chapple, "Pop art pioneer marks 2008", ''Liverpool Daily Post'', 26/5/06, p3</ref> In 2008, Blake painted a pig for the public art event ''King Bladud's Pigs in Bath'' in the city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].<ref>[http://www.kingbladudspigs.org/pigs/showpig.php?pig_id=66 ''King Bladud's Pigs in Bath'']</ref>

A fan of [[Chelsea F.C|Chelsea]] Football Club, Blake designed a collage to promote the team's home kit in 2010. He also designed a shopping bag for the [[Lucky Brand Jeans]] company for the holiday season.
As part of 'The Big Egg Hunt' February 2012 Sir Peter Blake designed an egg on behalf of [[Dorchester Collection]]. Blake created the carpet which runs through the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]'s [[Middlesex Guildhall]] building.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/8151625.stm|title=BBC NEWS – In Pictures – In pictures: UK Supreme Court|date=15 July 2009}}</ref>

As he approached his 80th birthday, Blake undertook a project to recreate the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' album cover with images of [[British culture|British cultural icons]] of his life that he most admires.<ref name="Icons" /> He stated: "I had a very long list of people who I wanted to go in but couldn't fit everyone in – I think that shows how strong British culture and its legacy of the last six decades is."<ref name="Icons">{{cite news|title=New faces on Sgt Pepper album cover for artist Peter Blake's 80th birthday|url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/02/peter-blake-sgt-pepper-cover-revisited|agency=The Guardian|date=5 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Peter Blake's new Beatles' Sgt Pepper's album cover (with video interview)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17583026|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=2 April 2012}}</ref> The new version was created for a special birthday celebration of Blake's life at fashion designer [[Wayne Hemingway]]'s Vintage festival at [[Boughton House]], Northamptonshire in July 2012.<ref name="Icons" />

An exhibition was held at [[Pallant House Gallery]] in Chichester to celebrate the artist's long associations with music called [Peter Blake and Pop Music] (23 June to 7 October 2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pallant.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/forthcoming/main-galleries/peter-blake-pop-music|title=Peter Blake: Pop Music|access-date=29 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406114553/http://www.pallant.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/forthcoming/main-galleries/peter-blake-pop-music|archive-date=6 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2014, he exhibited his illustrations inspired by ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'' at [[National Museum Cardiff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/whatson/?event_id=7009|title=Llareggub: Peter Blake illustrates Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood|accessdate=1 June 2014|date=2013}}</ref> In 2016, Blake designed the artwork for Eric Clapton's studio album ''[[I Still Do (Eric Clapton album)|I Still Do]]''.
