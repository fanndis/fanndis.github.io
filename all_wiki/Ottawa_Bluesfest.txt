'''Ottawa Bluesfest''' is an annual outdoor [[music festival]] that takes place each July in downtown [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada. While the festival's lineup historically focused on [[blues]] music at its inception, it has increasingly showcased mainstream [[pop music|pop]], hip hop, reggae, and [[rock music|rock]] acts in recent years. Bluesfest has become the largest blues festival in Canada and the second largest in North America.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/music/bluesfest-unveiled-eclectic-lineup-includes-duran-duran-red-hot-chili-peppers-lumineers-and-brad-paisley|title=Bluesfest lineup includes Duran Duran, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lumineers and Brad Paisley|date=2016-02-23|work=Ottawa Citizen|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ottawa-information-guide.com/ottawa-bluesfest.html |title=Bluesfest |publisher=Ottawa Information Guide |accessdate=2012-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704093409/http://www.ottawa-information-guide.com/ottawa-bluesfest.html |archive-date=2011-07-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Organization==
Since its inception, the festival has been managed by executive and artistic director Mark Monahan. The organization also manages [[CityFolk Festival]]<ref>http://cityfolkfestival.com/</ref> (2011-) and the Ontario Festival of Small Halls.<ref>http://thefestivalofsmallhalls.com/</ref>

In 2002, Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest won the Best Event Award from the Ottawa Tourism and Convention Authority and in 2003 the organization received the Keeping the Blues Alive (KBA) award for arts education from the Memphis Blues Foundation. Mark Monahan is a past recipient of the Toronto Blues Society's Blues with a Feeling award. In December 2011, Bluesfest reached a five-year sponsorship deal with [[RBC Royal Bank]] to ensure its financial stability. Henceforth, the event will be known as RBC Bluesfest.<ref>[https://ottawacitizen.com/news/look+back+year/5935231/story.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109041706/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/look+back+year/5935231/story.html |date=January 9, 2012 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Bluesfest crowds Ottawa 2011.jpg|right|thumb|Bluesfest crowds during the 2011 festival]]
The festival was first held in 1994 at [[Majors Hill Park]] with the performance of [[Clarence Clemons]], attracting 5,000 spectators.
The following year the festival attracted larger crowds with entertainers like [[John Hiatt]] and [[Buddy Guy]]. In 1996, 25,000 fans attended Bluesfest to see [[Robert Cray]], [[Los Lobos]] and others. It was then that the [[Mitel]] corporation became the first major sponsor of the event. In 1997, the festival was moved to [[Confederation Park]] to provide more space for the increasing number of fans to see musicians such as [[Dr. John]] and [[Little Feat]]. In 1998, over 80,000 people showed up for the festival, which coincided with [[Canada Day]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Bell Mobility]] and [[CIBC Wood Gundy]] joined the list of sponsors. In 1999, the festival was moved to [[LeBreton Flats]]. Bluesfest became a registered charitable organization while attracting over 95,000 fans. The [[Royal Canadian Mint]] became a sponsor. [[Cisco Systems]] became the Bluesfest Title Sponsor in 2001, while the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' and the ''[[National Post]]'' became Presenting Sponsors. In 2002, Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest moved to Festival Plaza in downtown Ottawa and 200,000 fans.<ref name="ottawakiosk1">{{cite web|author=Official city of Ottawa Representative |url=http://www.ottawakiosk.com/bluesfest/ottawa_bluesfest-2009.html/pa/v/history |title=Ottawa Bluesfest - History - Ottawa Bluesfest - Ottawa Festivals and Events |publisher=Ottawakiosk.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-02}}</ref>

In 2003, the festival expanded to eight stages to celebrate its tenth anniversary with 220,000 people in attendance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnblues.com/review/2003/ottawabluesfest03-th.html |title=Ottawa Bluesfest 2003 Live Review |publisher=Mnblues.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-02}}</ref> 2005 saw the festival further diversify its offerings, reaching out to a younger audience as well as those interested in more than just blues. The 2006 edition saw continued growth with increased crowds and the move of the MBNA stage to Lisgar Collegiate Institute to provide more capacity. In 2007, Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest relocated to LeBreton Flats Park, a move from the site at Festival Plaza the previous year. The new site offered five stages in and around the [[Canadian War Museum]]. The stage set-up featured twin main stages akin to the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]], which allowed audiences to transfer between headlining acts.<ref name="ottawakiosk1"/>

The festival continues to be held in July annually for 9–12 days. Headliners such as [[B.B King]] and the [[Dixie Chicks]] (2013), [[Blake Shelton]] and [[Lady Gaga]] (2014), [[Kanye West]] (2015), [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] (2016), and [[Foo Fighters]] (2018) attracting approximately 300,000 attendees each year.<ref>http://www.ottawabluesfest.ca/about-us/our-organization/</ref>

Along with showcasing international musical talent, Bluesfest is a non-profit charitable organization with year-round music education initiatives such as Blues in the Schools, Be in the Band, and the Bluesfest School of Music and Art, augmenting a focus on developing local artists in the Ottawa region.<ref>http://www.ottawabluesfest.ca/community/</ref>

=== Accident ===
On July 17, 2011, just 20 minutes into [[Cheap Trick]]’s set, a thunderstorm blew through the festival area. The band and crew narrowly escaped the collapse of the stage's 50-ton roof. It fell away from the audience and landed on the band's truck which was parked alongside the back of the stage, breaking the fall and allowing everyone about 30 seconds to escape. [[Robin Zander]] was treated for a laceration to the abdomen and released from hospital the same day.<ref name="Kot">{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|title=Cheap Trick lobbies Congress to regulate temporary stages|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-10-03/entertainment/chi-cheap-trick-lobbies-congress-band-seeks-stage-regulations-20111003_1_cheap-trick-guitarist-rick-nielsen-ferris-wheel|accessdate=20 December 2011|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=10 October 2011}}</ref>

=== Nesting Killdeer ===
[[File:Ottawa Bluesfest 2018, just past sunset on the last night, as seen from the RBC VIP tent.

It was right where the main stage was about to be constructed. Killdeer and their nesting grounds are protected under the [[Migratory Birds Convention Act]]. With permission from [[Environment and Climate Change Canada]], and help from the [[Woodlands Wildlife Sanctuary]], the nest was successfully moved 25 meters, one meter at a time, to a protected area behind the stage site, and stage construction was allowed to continue after a 12-hour delay.<ref name="cbc.ca">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/bluesfest-bird-nest-on-move-1.4722842|title=Bluesfest bird's nest on the move {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/kildeer-nest-final-journey-bluesfest-1.4724128|title=Killdeer move complete: Birds getting used to new digs at Bluesfest {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44605201|title=Bird upstages Canadian blues festival|date=2018-06-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-GB}}</ref> It marked a first for successful killdeer nest relocation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/06/30/624911875/ottawa-bird-eggs-get-moved|title=Ottawa Bird Eggs Get Moved|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en}}</ref>
