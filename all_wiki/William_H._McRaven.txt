McRaven attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]] where he was a walk-on member of the track team, and was a member of the [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]]. He graduated in 1977 with a bachelor's degree in [[journalism]],<ref>{{Cite news|first=Carol|last=Christian|date=May 3, 2011|title=Head of unit that killed bin Laden has Texas ties|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]] |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/metro/7548950.html |accessdate=May 4, 2011}}</ref> and was named a Distinguished Alumnus in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/highereducation/entries/2012/05/08/texas_exes_name_6_distinguishe.html|title=The lowdown on higher education |work= [[Austin American-Statesman]]|date=May 8, 2012 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2012/05/texas-exes-announce-2012-distinguished-alumni/ |title=All Hail the Texas Exes' 2012 Distinguished Alumni |publisher=[[The Alcalde]]|date= May 2012 |accessdate= 2014-02-12}}</ref> McRaven holds a master's degree from the [[Naval Postgraduate School]], where he helped establish and was the first graduate from the [[Special operations]]/[[Low intensity conflict]] curriculum.

==Naval Career==

===Special operations===
After graduating from The University of Texas at Austin, McRaven was commissioned as an officer in the [[U.S. Navy]] and volunteered for [[United States Navy SEAL selection and training|Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training]] (BUD/S). After six months of training, McRaven graduated BUD/S class 95 in January 1978. Following completion of a six month probationary period, he received the 1130 designator as a Naval Special Warfare Officer, entitled to wear the [[Special Warfare insignia]].  As a Navy SEAL officer, McRaven was deployed to the Philippines.<ref>{{cite news |author=Gal Perl Finkel |date=March 7, 2017 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/A-new-strategy-against-ISIS-483521 |title=A New Strategy Against ISIS |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}</ref> In 1982, as a junior officer, McRaven was assigned to [[SEAL Team Six]] under the command of CDR [[Richard Marcinko]] but was removed one year later due to McRaven's concerns about military discipline, and difficulties in keeping his sailors in line. Richard Marcinko fired the 27-year-old McRaven in 1983. "He was a bright guy, but he didn't like my rude and crude way," Marcinko said. "If I was a loose cannon, he was too rigid. He took the special out of special warfare."<ref>{{cite news |first1=Mark |last1=Mazzetti |first2=Nicholas |last2=Kulish |first3=Christopher |last3=Drew |first4=Serge F. |last4=Kovaleski |first5=Sean D. |last5=Naylor |first6=John |last6=Ismay |title=SEAL Team 6: A Secret History of Quiet Killings and Blurred Lines |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 6, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/world/asia/the-secret-history-of-seal-team-6.html |access-date=June 19, 2015}}</ref> McRaven later returned to his position as a squadron commander at Naval Special Warfare Development Group after Marcinko was forced to give up his command of the unit later that same year. 
 
McRaven served numerous staff and command assignments within the special operations community, including platoon commander at Underwater Demolition Team 21/SEAL Team Four, squadron commander at Naval Special Warfare Development Group, Executive Officer of SEAL Team ONE, task unit commander during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], task group commander in the [[CENTCOM]] area of responsibility, commanding officer of SEAL Team THREE, deputy commander for operations at JSOC, commanding officer of [[United States Navy SEALs#Naval Special Warfare Groups|Naval Special Warfare Group ONE]] from 1999 to 2001. 
McRaven earned his [[Master of Arts]] degree at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] in Monterey, California, in 1993. McRaven's thesis was titled "The Theory of Special Operations" (republished in 1995 as ''Spec Ops: Case Studies in Special Operations Warfare: Theory and Practice'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/14838|title=The Theory of Special Operations|date=June 18, 1993}}</ref>

McRaven later served as a staff officer with an interagency coordination focus, including as the director for Strategic Planning in the Office of Combating Terrorism on the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] Staff, assessment director at U.S. Special Operations Command, on the Staff of the Chief of Naval Operations and the chief of staff at Naval Special Warfare Group&nbsp;1.

McRaven was the deputy to General [[Stanley A. McChrystal]], and later leader, of a battle group targeting [[Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn|Al Qaeda in Iraq]] called 'Task Force 714' which proved to be innovative and highly successful.<ref>Shultz, Richard H.; Joint Special Operations University.

On April 6, 2011, McRaven was nominated by President [[Barack Obama]] for promotion from the rank of [[vice admiral]] to [[admiral]] and appointed as the ninth commander of USSOCOM,<ref>{{cite press release |title=Flag Officer Announcements |url=http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=14389 |work=Defense.gov |publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs)|date=April 6, 2011|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}</ref> of which JSOC is a component.

In his confirmation hearings, McRaven "endorsed a steady manpower growth rate of 3% to 5% a year" and favored more resources for USSOCOM.

====Operation Neptune Spear====
McRaven is credited for organizing and overseeing the execution of [[Operation Neptune Spear]],<ref name="McRaven">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8488479/Osama-bin-Laden-dead-Hamas-condemns-killing-of-bin-Laden.html |title=Osama bin Laden dead: Hamas condemns killing of bin Laden |first=Craig |last=Whitlock|work=The Washington Post |date=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-04 |location=London}}</ref> the special ops raid that led to the [[death of Osama bin Laden|killing of Osama bin Laden]] on May 2, 2011. CIA Director [[Leon Panetta]] delegated operational & execution decisions on the raid to McRaven, who had worked almost exclusively on counter-terrorism operations and strategy since 2001.<ref name="McRaven" />

According to ''The New York Times'', "In February, Mr. Panetta called then-Vice Adm. William H. McRaven, commander of the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command, to [[CIA]] headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]], to give him details about the compound and to begin planning a military strike. Admiral McRaven, a veteran of the covert world who had written a book on American Special Operations, spent weeks working with the CIA on the operation, and came up with three options: a helicopter assault using U.S. Navy SEALs, a strike with [[B-2]] bombers that would obliterate the compound, or a joint raid with [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Pakistani intelligence]] operatives who would be told about the mission hours before the launch."<ref name="NYT01">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/world/asia/03intel.html |work=The New York Times |first1=Mark |last1=Mazzetti |first2=Helene |last2=Cooper |first3=Peter |last3=Baker |title=Clues Gradually Led to the Location of Osama bin Laden |pages=2–3|date=May 2, 2011}}</ref> The day before the assault, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] "took a break from rehearsing for the [[White House Correspondents Dinner]] that night to call Admiral McRaven, to wish him luck".<ref name=NYT01 />

A June 2013 [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information]] request revealed that on May 13, 2011, McRaven sent email titled "OPSEC Guidance / Neptune Spear" that instructed redacted recipients that "all photos [of [[Usama Bin Laden|UBL]]'s remains] should have been turned over to the CIA; if you still have them destroy them immediately" or "get them to" a recipient whose identity was redacted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2-10-14-JW-v-DoD-McRaven.pdf |title=Judicial Watch v.

In August 2018, McRaven expressed support for former [[CIA Director]] [[John O. Brennan]], whose [[security clearance]] had recently been revoked by the [[Trump Administration]]. He authored an [[open letter]] to President [[Donald Trump]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' entitled "Revoke my security clearance, too, Mr. President", in which he affirmed his regard for Brennan, his former colleague, and offered criticism of the decisions and personal behavior of President Trump.<ref name="revoke" /> McRaven said of Brennan, "He is a man of unparalleled integrity, whose honesty and character have never been in question ... except by those who don't know him." Of Trump, McRaven wrote, "Through your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation."<ref name="2018-08-17_ABC">{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-17/retired-admiral-william-mcraven-speaks-out-against-donald-trump/10131364 |title=Retired US Navy admiral William McRaven praises John Brennan, says he won't be scared into silence by Donald Trump |agency=Reuters |publisher=ABC News |date=August 17, 2018}}</ref>

In a November 18, 2018, interview on [[Fox News]], [[Chris Wallace]] mentioned McRaven's name. Trump retorted twice, "[[Hillary Clinton]] fan" and accused McRaven of being a fan of former President [[Barack Obama]]. McRaven later told [[CNN]], "I did not back Hillary Clinton or anyone else. I am a fan of President Obama and President [[George W. Bush]], both of whom I worked for. I admire all presidents, regardless of their political party, who uphold the dignity of the office and who use that office to bring the nation together in challenging times."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/18/politics/donald-trump-william-mcraven/index.html|title=Architect of bin Laden raid: Trump 'threatens the Constitution' when he attacks the media|author1=Jake Tapper |author2= Devan Cole|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}</ref> One media source noted that Trump's ire seemed to be rooted in "McRaven’s criticism that the president’s rhetoric toward the press is the 'greatest threat to democracy' in his lifetime".<ref>Samuels, Brett, ''[https://thehill.com/policy/defense/417493-trump-stokes-new-unlikely-feud?userid=281896 Trump stokes new unlikely feud]'', The Hill, November 19, 2018</ref>

On October 17, 2019, McRaven published an [[op-ed]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' with the headline "Our Republic Is Under Attack From the President" arguing that if Trump did not demonstrate leadership, the sooner he is replaced, the better. He elaborated his position in a CNN interview the same day, saying that Trump was undermining domestic institutions and damaging America's international standing, especially with respect to the treatment of the Kurds during the [[2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/17/politics/william-mcraven-trump-cnntv/index.html|title=Architect of bin Laden raid says Trump is working to 'destroy' the country|last=LeBlanc|first=Paul|date=October 17, 2019|website=CNN|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>

Upon the February 2020 dismissal by the president of [[Joseph Maguire]] for having briefed congressional intelligence committee members about emerging evidence of foreign efforts to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, McRaven authored a guest editorial in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in which he declared that, "As Americans, we should be frightened — deeply afraid for the future of the nation. When good men and women can’t speak the truth, when facts are inconvenient, when integrity and character no longer matter, when presidential ego and self-preservation are more important than national security — then there is nothing left to stop the triumph of evil."<ref>McRaven, William H., ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/william-mcraven-if-good-men-like-joe-maguire-cant-speak-the-truth-we-should-be-deeply-afraid/2020/02/21/2068874c-5503-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html William McRaven: If good men like Joe Maguire can’t speak the truth, we should be deeply afraid]'', Washington Post, February 21, 2020</ref>
