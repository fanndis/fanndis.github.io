During 1889, [[Thomas Edison]] had business interests in many electricity-related companies, including Edison Lamp Company, a lamp manufacturer in [[East Newark, New Jersey]]; [[Edison Machine Works]], a manufacturer of [[dynamo]]s and large [[electric motor]]s in [[Schenectady, New York]]; Bergmann & Company, a manufacturer of electric [[Light fixture|lighting fixtures]], [[Lightbulb socket|sockets]], and other electric lighting devices; and ''Edison Electric Light Company'', the [[patent]]-holding company and the financial arm backed by [[J. P.

In 1889, [[Drexel, Morgan & Co.]], a company founded by J.P. Morgan and [[Anthony J. Drexel]], financed Edison's research and helped merge those companies under one corporation to form Edison General Electric Company, which was incorporated in New York on April 24, 1889. The new company also acquired [[Sprague Electric Railway & Motor Company]] in the same year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edison Companies |url=http://edison.rutgers.edu/list.htm |work=The Thomas Edison Papers |publisher=Rutgers University |accessdate=February 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008140933/http://edison.rutgers.edu/list.htm |archive-date=October 8, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="jpmorgan">{{cite web |title=FAQs: How did the firm impact the advent of electricity? |url=http://www.jpmorgan.com/pages/jpmorgan/about/history/faq#Question_10 |publisher=J.P.

In 1880, Gerald Waldo Hart formed the American Electric Company of [[New Britain, Connecticut]], which merged a few years later with [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]], led by [[Charles A. Coffin|Charles Coffin]]. In 1887, Hart left to become superintendent of the Edison Electric Company of [[Kansas City, Missouri]].<ref>''Connecticut History Makers'', by Elias Robert Stevenson, 1930</ref> General Electric was formed through the 1892 merger of Edison General Electric Company of Schenectady, New York, and Thomson-Houston Electric Company of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], with the support of Drexel, Morgan & Co.<ref name="jpmorgan"/> Both plants continue to operate under the GE banner to this day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ge.com/company/history/edison.html |title=Thomas Edison & GE |publisher=GE company web site |accessdate=December 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212103128/http://www.ge.com/company/history/edison.html |archive-date=February 12, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The company was incorporated in New York, with the Schenectady plant used as headquarters for many years thereafter.

In 1893 General Electric bought the business of Rudolf Eickemeyer in [[Yonkers, New York]], along with all of its patents and designs. One of the employees was [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz]]. Only recently arrived in the United States, Steinmetz was already publishing in the field of magnetic hysteresis and had earned worldwide professional recognition.<ref name="IEEEPER (1996)">{{cite journal |title=The Magnetic Force of Charles Proteus Steinmetz |journal=IEEE Power Engineering Review |date=Feb 1996 |volume=16 |issue=9 |page=7 |doi=10.1109/MPER.1996.535476 |s2cid=44921529 }}</ref>  Led by Steinmetz, Eickemeyer's firm had developed [[transformer]]s for use in the [[electric power transmission|transmission of electrical power]] among many other mechanical and electrical devices.

In 1911, General Electric absorbed the National Electric Lamp Association (NELA) into its lighting business. GE established its lighting division headquarters at [[Nela Park]] in [[East Cleveland, Ohio]]. The lighting division has since remained in the same location.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/insideout/index.ssf/2016/12/nela_park_light_display_hower.html|title=Nela Park holiday lights, Hower House Museum display and recycle holiday lights: Home and Garden News|work=cleveland.com|access-date=March 24, 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621225754/http://www.cleveland.com/insideout/index.ssf/2016/12/nela_park_light_display_hower.html|archive-date=June 21, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===RCA and NBC===
Owen D. Young, through GE, founded the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) in 1919, after purchasing the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America]]. He aimed to expand international radio communications. GE used RCA as its retail arm for radio sales.<ref>Mahon, Morgan E. ''A Flick of the Switch 1930–1950'' (Antiques Electronics Supply, 1990), p.86.</ref> In 1926, RCA co-founded the [[National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC), which built two radio broadcasting networks. In 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations and decided to divest itself of RCA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nocable.org/timeline/nbc-history|title=Timeline: The History of NBC|website=NoCable.org|language=en|access-date=March 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619140207/https://nocable.org/timeline/nbc-history|archive-date=June 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On January 13, 1928, he made what was said to be the first broadcast to the public in the United States<ref name="inventors.about.com"/> on GE's [[W2XAD]]: the pictures were picked up on 1.5 square inch (9.7 square centimeter) screens in the homes of four GE executives. The sound was broadcast on GE's [[WGY (AM)]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Experimental television station W2XAD evolved into the station [[WRGB]] which, along with WGY and WGFM (now [[WRVE]]), was owned and operated by General Electric until 1983.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schenectady Country Historical Society|title=Niskayuna: Images of America|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1439-63-7500|location=United States of America}}</ref>

Led by [[Sanford Alexander Moss]], GE moved into the new field of aircraft [[turbosupercharger|turbo superchargers]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} This technology also led to the development of industrial gas turbine engines used for power production.<ref> https://www.axcontrol.com/blog/2020/a-history-of-ge-speedtronic-turbine-control/27/01/ </ref>   GE introduced the first set of superchargers during World War I, and continued to develop them during the [[interwar period]]. Superchargers became indispensable in the years immediately prior to World War II. GE supplied 300,000 turbo superchargers for use in fighter and bomber engines. This work led the U.S. Army Air Corps to select GE to develop the nation's first jet engine during the war.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/93760-general-electric-pioneers-jet-engine-manufacturing|title=General Electric Pioneers Jet Engine Manufacturing|last=Weber|first=Austin|date=March 28, 2017|work=Assembly Magazine|access-date=January 5, 2018|publisher=BNP Media|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704173947/http://www.assemblymag.com/articles/93760-general-electric-pioneers-jet-engine-manufacturing|archive-date=July 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This experience, in turn, made GE a natural selection to develop the [[Whittle W.1]] [[jet engine]] that was demonstrated in the United States in 1941.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Whittle |first1=Sir Frank |last2=Golley |first2=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6HcngEACAAJ |title=Jet |edition=illustrated |editor-last=Gunston |editor-first=Bill |publisher=Datum Publishing |year=2010 |pages=181–182 |isbn=978-1907472008 |accessdate=January 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205124418/https://books.google.com/books?id=W6HcngEACAAJ |archive-date=February 5, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> GE was ranked ninth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M.

Some consumers [[boycott]]ed GE light bulbs, refrigerators and other products during the 1980s and 1990s. The purpose of the boycott was to protest against GE's role in [[nuclear weapon]]s production.<ref>[https://www.transparency.org/research/gcr/gcr_private_sector/0/ Global Corruption Report 2009, Corruption and the Private Sector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320054022/https://www.transparency.org/research/gcr/gcr_private_sector/0/|date=March 20, 2012}} [[Transparency International]] 2009 page 148 {{in lang|en}}</ref>

In 2018, GE Power garnered press attention when a model 7HA gas turbine in Texas was shut down for two months due to the break of a [[turbine blade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-power-exclusive/exclusive-ges-push-to-fix-power-turbine-problem-goes-global-idUSKBN1O60F4|title=GE GE's push to fix power turbine problem goes global: sources|work=reuters.com|access-date=June 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531051321/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-power-exclusive/exclusive-ges-push-to-fix-power-turbine-problem-goes-global-idUSKBN1O60F4/|archive-date=May 31, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> This model uses similar blade technology to GE's newest and most efficient model, the 9HA. After the break, GE developed new protective coatings and heat treatment methods. Gas turbines represent a significant portion of GE Power's revenue, and also represent a significant portion of the power generation fleet of several utility companies in the United States. [[Chubu Electric]] of Japan and [[Électricité de France]] also had units that were impacted. Initially, GE did not realize the turbine blade issue of the 9FB unit would impact the new HA units.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-turbines-focus/ge-urges-speedy-fix-for-power-turbine-blades-says-blade-broke-in-2015-sources-idUSKCN1PJ0DM|title=GE urges speedy fix for power turbine blades, says blade broke in 2015: sources|work=reuters.com|first=Alwyn|last=Scott|date=January 25, 2019|accessdate=January 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125063123/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-turbines-focus/ge-urges-speedy-fix-for-power-turbine-blades-says-blade-broke-in-2015-sources-idUSKCN1PJ0DM|archive-date=January 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1962, GE started developing its [[GECOS]] (later renamed GCOS) [[operating system]], originally for [[batch processing]], but later extended to [[timesharing]] and [[transaction processing]]. Versions of GCOS are still in use today. From 1964 to 1969, GE and [[Bell Laboratories]] (which soon dropped out) joined with [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to develop the [[Multics]] operating system on the [[GE 645]] mainframe computer.

We are evaluating the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statements and anticipate that its adoption will significantly change the accounting for measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities. The ASU requires cash flow assumptions used in the measurement of various insurance liabilities to be reviewed at least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumptions need to be revised with any required changes recorded in earnings. The discount rate, equivalent to the upper-medium grade (i.e., single A) fixed-income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liability, is required to be updated in each reporting period with changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. In measuring the insurance liabilities, contracts shall not be grouped together from different issue years. While we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting, we anticipate that the adoption of the ASU may materially affect our financial statements. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820235127/https://www.ge.com/investor-relations/sites/default/files/ge_webcast_10Q_10302018.pdf |archive-date=August 20, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Mr. Markopolos estimated there will be a $US 10.5&nbsp;billion charge when the new accounting standard is adopted in the first quarter of 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=General Electric whistleblower: 'I think I have a few smoking guns' Harry Markopolos reveals fraud |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jE10T250bo |website=YouTube.com |publisher=Yahoo Finance |accessdate=21 August 2019 |language=en |time=M:SS=3.25 |date=August 15, 2019 |quote=GE is hiding $29B in long-term care losses |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820145045/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jE10T250bo |archive-date=August 20, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Anticipated $8 billion loss upon disposition of Baker Hughes====
In 2017, GE acquired a 62.5% interest in Baker Hughes (BHGE) when it combined its oil & gas business with Baker Hughes Incorporated.<ref>{{cite web |title=2017 Annual Report |url=https://www.ge.com/investor-relations/sites/default/files/GE_AR17.pdf |website=GE.com |accessdate=20 August 2019 |pages=21 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412212038/https://www.ge.com/investor-relations/sites/default/files/GE_AR17.pdf |archive-date=April 12, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 
In 2018, GE reduced its interest to 50.4%, resulting in the realization of a $2.1&nbsp;billion loss.  GE is planning to divest its remaining interest and has warned that the divestment will result in an additional loss of $8.4&nbsp;billion (assuming a BHGE share price of $23.57 per share).<ref>{{cite web |author1=General Electric |title=2018 Annual Report - General Electric |url=https://www.ge.com/investor-relations/sites/default/files/GE_AR18.pdf |website=GE.com |accessdate=20 August 2019 |pages=139 |language=en |quote=As previously announced, we plan an orderly separation of our ownership interest in BHGE over time. In November 2018, BHGE completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold 101.2 million shares of BHGE Class A common stock. BHGE also repurchased 65.0 million BHGE LLC units from GE. As a result, our economic interest in BHGE reduced from 62.5% to 50.4% and we recognized a loss of $2,169 million ($1,696 million after-tax), which decreased the Other Capital component of shareowners' equity. Sale of Class A common stock resulted in an increase in noncontrolling interests of $4,214 million. Any reduction in our ownership interest below 50% will result in us losing control of BHGE. At that point, we would de-consolidate our Oil & Gas segment, recognize any remaining interest at fair value and recognize any difference between carrying value and fair value of our interest in earnings. Depending on the form and timing of our separation, and if BHGE’s stock price remains below our current carrying value, we may recognize a significant loss in earnings. Based on BHGE's share price on January 31, 2019, of $23.57 per share, the incremental loss upon deconsolidation by a sale of our interest would be approximately $8,400 million. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923162718/https://www.ge.com/investor-relations/sites/default/files/GE_AR18.pdf |archive-date=September 23, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In response to the fraud allegations, GE noted the amount of the loss would be $7.4&nbsp;billion if the divestment occurred on July 26, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=follow-up-from-last-weeks-note |url=https://www.ge.com/reports/follow-up-from-last-weeks-note/ |website=GE.com |publisher=General Electric |accessdate=20 August 2019 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190820234938/https://www.ge.com/reports/follow-up-from-last-weeks-note/ |archive-date=August 20, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Mr. Markopolos noted that BHGE is an asset available for sale and therefore [[mark-to-market accounting]] is required.<ref>{{cite web |title=Harry Markopolos explains fraud accusations against GE |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGvsXPY26KI |website=YouTube.com |publisher=CNN Business |accessdate=21 August 2019 |location=MM:SS=5:17 |language=en |date=August 16, 2019 |quote=They should have marked it to market |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818074723/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGvsXPY26KI |archive-date=August 18, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1959, General Electric was accused of promoting the largest illegal cartel in the United States since the adoption of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
