The '''Brazilian real''' ({{lang-pt|'''real'''}}, [[plural|pl.]] '''''{{lang|pt|reais}}''''';  [[currency symbol|sign]]: '''R$'''; [[ISO 4217|code]]: '''BRL''') is the official [[currency]] of [[Brazil]]. It is subdivided into 100 [[centavo]]s. The [[Central Bank of Brazil]] is the central bank and the issuing authority. The real replaced the [[Brazilian cruzeiro real|cruzeiro real]] in 1994.

As of April 2016, the real is the nineteenth most traded currency in the world by value.<ref>{{cite web|title=Triennial Central Bank Survey Foreign exchange turnover in April 2016|url=http://www.bis.org/publ/rpfx16fx.pdf|work=Triennial Central Bank Survey|publisher=Bank for International Settlements|accessdate=22 March 2017|location=Basel, Switzerland|page=7|format=PDF|date=11 December 2016}}</ref>

==History==

The modern real (Portuguese plural ''reais'' or English plural ''reals'') was introduced on 1 July 1994, during the presidency of [[Itamar Franco]], when [[Rubens Ricupero]] was the Minister of 'Fazenda'—Brazilian nomenclature for Minister of Finance—as part of a broader plan to stabilize the [[Economy of Brazil|Brazilian economy]], known as the [[Plano Real]]. The new currency replaced the short-lived [[Brazilian cruzeiro real|cruzeiro real]] (CR$). The reform included the [[Legal tender#Demonetization|demonetisation]] of the cruzeiro real and required a massive banknote replacement.

At its introduction, the real was defined to be equal to 1 ''[[unidade real de valor]]'' (URV, "real value unit") a non-circulating currency unit.  At the same time the URV was defined to be worth 2,750 cruzeiros reais, which was the average exchange rate of the [[U.S. dollar]] to the cruzeiro real on that day.  As a consequence, the real was worth exactly one U.S. dollar as it was introduced.  Combined with all previous currency changes in the country's history, this reform made the new real equal to 2.75 × 10<sup>18</sup> (2.75 [[quintillion]]) of Brazil's original [[Brazilian real (old)|réis]].

Soon after its introduction, the real unexpectedly gained value against the U.S. dollar, due to large capital inflows in late 1994 and 1995.  During that period it attained its maximum dollar value ever, about US$1.20.  Between 1996 and 1998 the exchange rate was tightly controlled by the [[Central Bank of Brazil]], so that the real depreciated slowly and smoothly in relation to the dollar, dropping from near 1:1 to about 1.2:1 by the end of 1998.  In January 1999 the deterioration of the international markets, disrupted by the [[Russian default]], forced the Central Bank, under its new president [[Arminio Fraga]], to float the exchange rate. This decision produced a major devaluation, to a rate of almost R$2:US$1.<ref>[[BNDES]]: [http://www.bndes.gov.br/SiteBNDES/export/sites/default/bndes_en/Galerias/Download/studies/td91-ing.pdf BRAZIL IN THE 1990: A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION?] page 10.</ref>

In the following years, the currency's value against the dollar followed an erratic but mostly downwards path from 1999 until late 2002, when the prospect of the election of leftist candidate [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], considered a radical populist by sectors of the financial markets, prompted another currency crisis and a spike in inflation.  Many Brazilians feared another default on government debts or a resumption of heterodox economic policies, and rushed to exchange their reais into tangible assets or foreign currencies.

The crisis subsided once Lula took office, after he, his finance minister [[Antonio Palocci]], and Arminio Fraga reaffirmed their intention to continue the orthodox macroeconomic policies of his predecessor (including inflation-targeting, primary fiscal surplus and [[floating exchange rate]], as well as continued payments of the public debt). The value of the real in dollars continued to fluctuate but generally upwards, so that by 2005 the exchange was a little over R$2:US$1.  In May 2007, for the first time since 2001(last 6 years),  the real became worth more than US$0.50—even though the Central Bank, concerned about its effect on the Brazilian economy, had tried to keep it below that symbolic threshold. Lula started his government in 01/01/2003 with an exchange rate of 1USD = 3.52BRL and finished it in 12/31/2010 with an exchange rate of 1USD=1.66BRL.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cotações e boletins|url=https://www4.bcb.gov.br/pec/taxas/port/ptaxnpesq.asp?frame=1|access-date=2020-07-30|website=www4.bcb.gov.br}}</ref>

The exchange rate as of September 2015 was BRL 4.05 to US$1.00. After a period of gradual recover, it reached 3.0 BRL per US dollar by February 2017.

[[Jair Bolsonaro]]'s tenure, initially welcomed with enthusiasm by the financial markets, started with USD1=BRL3.86. Fueled by meager results of the economy, quick disenchantment followed, resulting in lack of foreign investments and real's strong depreciation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Baixos índices de confiança na economia indicam incertezas para o pós-pandemia|url=https://www12.senado.leg.br/noticias/materias/2020/05/18/baixos-indices-de-confianca-na-economia-indicam-incertezas-para-o-pos-pandemia|access-date=2020-07-30|website=Senado Federal|language=pt-br}}</ref> In May, 13th, 2020, in the apex of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|coronavirus]] crisis, which deeply affected Brazil,<ref>{{Cite web|title=In pictures: The coronavirus is surging in Brazil|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/22/americas/gallery/brazil-coronavirus/index.html|access-date=2020-07-30|website=CNN}}</ref> the real reached a historical low against the US dollar, being negotiated at 1USD=5.90BRL.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-13|title=Dólar sobe a R$ 5,90, bate recorde nominal e fica a 1,67% dos R$ 6|url=https://noticias.r7.com/economia/dolar-sobe-a-r-590-bate-recorde-nominal-e-fica-a-167-dos-r-6-13052020|access-date=2020-07-30|website=R7.com|language=pt-br}}</ref>

==Coins==

===First series (1994–1997)===
Along with the first series of currency, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1 real; the 25 centavos piece was soon followed. All were struck in [[stainless steel]]. The original 1-real coins(produced only in 1994) were [[Legal tender#Demonetization|demonetized]] on 23 December 2003;<ref>[http://www.bcb.gov.br/ingles/Mecir/moeda1real/default.asp 1 Real stainless steel coin exchange], [[Central Bank of Brazil]].</ref> all other coins remain [[legal tender]].

====Commemorative coins====

In 1995, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], the [[Central Bank of Brazil]] released two commemorative variants of the 10 and 25 centavos coins.

===Second series (1998–present)===

In 1998, a second series of coins was introduced.  It featured copper-plated steel coins of 1 and 5 centavos, [[brass]]-plated steel coins of 10 and 25 centavos, a [[cupronickel]] 50 centavos coin, and a bi-coloured brass and cupronickel coin of 1 real. However, from 2002 onwards, steel was used for the 50 centavos coin and the central part of the 1 real coin.

In November 2005, the Central Bank [[Withdrawal of low-denomination coins|discontinued the production]] of the 1 centavo coins, but the existing ones continue to be legal tender. Retailers now generally round their prices to the next 5 or 10 centavos.

====Commemorative banknotes====

In April 2000, in commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the Portuguese arrival on Brazilian shores, the Brazilian Central Bank released a [[polymer banknote|polymer]] 10 real banknote that circulates along with the other banknotes above.

===Second series (2010–present)===

On 3 February 2010, the [[Central Bank of Brazil]] announced the new series of the real banknotes which would begin to be released in April 2010. The new design added security enhancements in an attempt to reduce [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting]]. The notes have different sizes according to their values to help [[blindness|vision-impaired]] people. The changes were made reflecting the growth of the [[Economy of Brazil|Brazilian economy]] and the need for a stronger and safer currency. The new banknotes began to enter circulation in December 2010, coexisting with the older ones.<ref>{{cite news|title=Novas cédulas do real devem chegar a todas as capitais em até 48 horas|first=Eduardo|last=Cucolo|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/845032-novas-cedulas-do-real-devem-chegar-a-todas-as-capitais-em-ate-48-horas.shtml|newspaper=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|date=13 December 2010|accessdate=2010-12-14|language=Portuguese|trans-title=New Real banknotes should arrive within 48 hours in all capitals}}</ref><ref>[http://banknotenews.com/files/05aae029aadcba674450f002024e9351-2196.php Brazil introduces new 10- and 20-real banknotes on 23 July 2012] BanknoteNews.com.
