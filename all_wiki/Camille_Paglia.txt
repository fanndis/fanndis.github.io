==Education==
Paglia entered Harpur College at [[Binghamton University]] in 1964.<ref name=Showalter>{{Citation | last = Showalter | first = Elaine | title = Inventing Herself: Claiming a Feminist Intellectual Heritage | place = London | publisher = Picador | year = 2002}}</ref> The same year, Paglia's poem "Atrophy" was published in the local newspaper.<ref>{{Cite news | title = ''Atrophy'' |newspaper=The Post-Standard |location=Syracuse, New York |date=April 12, 1964}}</ref> She later said that she was trained to read literature by poet [[Milton Kessler]], who "believed in the responsiveness of the body, and of the activation of the senses to literature&nbsp;... And oh did I believe in that".<ref name="Nester"/> She graduated from Harpur as class [[valedictorian]] in 1968.<ref name="time-1992-01-13" />

According to Paglia, while in college she punched a "marauding drunk,"<ref name="nyt-1994-11-20"/> and takes pride in having been put on [[probation]] for committing 39&nbsp;pranks.<ref name="Scotsman" />

Paglia attended [[Yale]] as a [[graduate student]], and she claims to have been the only open lesbian at [[Yale Graduate School]] from 1968 to 1972.<ref name="nyt-1994-11-20"/><ref>{{Cite news |first=Dan|last=Savage | title = Interview |newspaper=The Stranger |date = October 4, 1992}}</ref> At Yale, Paglia quarreled with [[Rita Mae Brown]], whom she later characterized as "then darkly [[Nihilism|nihilist]]," and argued with the [[New Haven|New Haven, Connecticut]], Women's Liberation Rock Band when they dismissed the [[Rolling Stones]] as [[Sexism|sexist]].<ref name="Editor 1998">"Letter to the Editor", Camille Paglia, "Chronicle of Higher Education", June 17, 1998.</ref> Paglia was mentored by [[Harold Bloom]].<ref name=Showalter /> ''Sexual Personae'' was then titled "The Androgynous Dream: the image of the androgyne as it appears in literature and is embodied in the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] of the artist, with reference to the visual arts and the cinema."<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Citation | type = letter | first = Camille A | last = Paglia | title = To Professor Carolyn Heilbrun | date = February 13, 1972 | publisher = Knopf Archive, Humanities Research Center | place = Austin, Texas}}</ref>

Paglia read [[Susan Sontag]] and aspired to emulate what she called her "celebrity, her positioning in the media world at the border of the high arts and popular culture." Paglia first saw Sontag in person on October 15, 1969 ([[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Vietnam Moratorium Day]]), when Paglia, then a Yale graduate student, was visiting a friend at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. In 1973, Paglia, a militant feminist and open lesbian, was working at her first academic job at [[Bennington College]]. She considered Sontag a radical who had challenged male dominance. The same year, Paglia drove to an appearance by Sontag at Dartmouth, hoping to arrange for her to speak at Bennington, but found it difficult to find the money for Sontag's speaking fee; Paglia relied on help from Richard Tristman, a friend of Sontag's, to persuade her to come. Bennington College agreed to pay Sontag $700 (twice what they usually offered speakers but only half Sontag's usual fee) to give a talk about contemporary issues. Paglia staged a poster campaign urging students to attend Sontag's appearance. Sontag arrived at Bennington Carriage Barn, where she was to speak, more than an hour late, and then began reading what Paglia recalled as a "boring and bleak" short story about "nothing" in the style of a [[Nouveau roman|French New Novel]].<ref name=RollysonandPaddock />

As a result of Sontag's Bennington College appearance, Paglia began to become disenchanted with her, believing that she had withdrawn from confrontation with the academic world, and that her "mandarin disdain" for popular culture showed an elitism that betrayed her early work, which had suggested that high and low culture both reflected a new sensibility.<ref name=RollysonandPaddock />

==Career==
In the autumn of 1972, Paglia began teaching at [[Bennington College]], which hired her in part thanks to a recommendation from [[Harold Bloom]].<ref name="Findlay">{{Citation | newspaper = [[Girlfriends magazine]] | first = Heather | last = Findlay | title = Interview |date=September 2000}}</ref> At Bennington, she befriended the philosopher James Fessenden, who first taught there in the same semester.{{Sfn|Paglia|1994|p=202}}

Through her study of the [[classical literature|classics]] and the scholarly work of [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], [[James George Frazer]], [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]] and others, Paglia developed a theory of sexual history that contradicted a number of ideas fashionable at the time, hence her criticism of [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Carolyn Heilbrun]], [[Kate Millett]] and others. She laid out her ideas on [[matriarchy]], [[androgyny]], homosexuality, [[sadomasochism]] and other topics in her Yale PhD thesis ''Sexual Personae: The Androgyne in Literature and Art,'' which she defended in December 1974.  In September 1976, she gave a public lecture drawing on that dissertation,<ref>{{Citation | newspaper = Bennington Banner | title = Lecture by Camille Paglia | date = September 20, 1976}}</ref> in which she discussed [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', followed by remarks on [[Diana Ross]], [[Gracie Allen]], [[Yul Brynner]], and [[Stéphane Audran]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Interview |date=November 2002}}</ref>

Paglia wrote that she "nearly came to blows with the founding members of the [[women's studies]] program at the [[State University of New York at Albany]], when they categorically denied that [[hormone]]s influence human experience or behavior".<ref>{{Citation | title = Letter to the Editor | first = Camille | last = Paglia | newspaper = [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date = June 17, 1998}}</ref> Similar fights with feminists and academics culminated in a 1978 incident which led her to resign from Bennington; after a lengthy standoff with the administration, Paglia accepted a [[legal settlement|settlement]] from the college and resigned in 1979.<ref name="Findlay" />

Paglia finished ''Sexual Personae'' in the early 1980s, but could not get it published. She supported herself with visiting and part-time teaching jobs at Yale, [[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]], and other Connecticut colleges. Her paper, "The [[Apollonian]] Androgyne and the Faerie Queene", was published in ''English Literary Renaissance'', Winter 1979, and her dissertation was cited by [[J.&nbsp;Hillis Miller]] in his April 1980 article "[[Wuthering Heights]] and the Ellipses of Interpretation", in ''Journal of Religion in Literature'', but her academic career was otherwise stalled.  In a 1995 letter to Boyd Holmes, she recalled: "I earned a little extra money by doing some local features reporting for a [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] alternative newspaper (''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'') in the early 1980s". She wrote articles on New Haven's historic [[pizzeria]]s and on an old house that was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Camille | last = Paglia | title = To Boyd Holmes (letter) |date=February 1995}}</ref>

In 1984, she joined the faculty of the Philadelphia College of Performing Arts, which merged in 1987 with the Philadelphia College of Art to become the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]].

Paglia is on the editorial board of the classics and [[humanities]] journal ''[[Arion (journal)|Arion]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bu.edu/arion/about-arion/ |title= About Arion |publisher= Boston University |accessdate= June 28, 2012 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120708062804/http://www.bu.edu/arion/about-arion/ |archive-date= July 8, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> She wrote a regular column for Salon.com from 1995 to 2001, and again from 2007 to 2009.

Paglia cooperated with Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock in their writing of ''Susan Sontag: The Making of an Icon'', sending them detailed letters from which they quoted with her permission. Rollyson and Paddock note that Sontag "had her lawyer put our publisher on notice" when she realized that they were investigating her life and career.<ref name=RollysonandPaddock>{{Citation | last1 = Rollyson | first1 = Carl | last2 = Paddock | first2 = Lisa | title = Susan Sontag: The Making of an Icon | place = New York | publisher = WW Norton & Co | year = 2000}}</ref>

Paglia participates in the decennial poll of film professionals conducted by ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' which asks participants to submit a list of what they believe to be the ten [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]]. According to her responses to the poll in 2002 and 2012, the films Paglia holds in highest regard include ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[The Godfather Part II|The Godfather: Part&nbsp;II]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[North by Northwest]]'', ''[[Orpheus (film)|Orphée]]'', ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=Camille&surname=Paglia  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120625143718/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=Camille&surname=Paglia  | url-status = dead  | archive-date = June 25, 2012  | title = How the directors and critics voted: Camille Paglia | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Sight & Sound]] via BFI | place = UK}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/voter/747 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120819021249/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/voter/747 | url-status = dead | archive-date = August 19, 2012 | title = Camille Paglia | year = 2012 | publisher = [[Sight & Sound]] via BFI | place = UK}}</ref>

In 2005, Paglia was named as one of the top 100 public intellectuals by the journals ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' and ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]''.<ref name="gm-2007-10-18"/> In 2012, an article in ''The New York Times'' remarked that {{nowrap|"[a]nyone}} who has been following the body count of the culture wars over the past decades knows Paglia".<ref name=on-art/> Paglia has said that she is willing to have her entire career judged on the basis of her composition of what she considers to be "probably the most important sentence that she has ever written": "God is man's greatest idea."<ref>{{cite web|title=Camille Paglia| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120524081033/http://bigideas.tvo.org/episode/128098/camille-paglia | archive-date = May 24, 2012 |url=http://bigideas.tvo.org/episode/128098/camille-paglia|work=Big Ideas|publisher=[[TVOntario|TVO]]|date=November 7, 2009}}</ref>

===Feminism===
Though Paglia admires [[Simone de&nbsp;Beauvoir]] and ''[[The Second Sex]]'' ("the supreme work of modern feminism&nbsp;... its deep learning and massive argument are unsurpassed") as well as [[Germaine Greer]],<ref name = Showalter /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' critic Martha Duffy writes that Paglia "does not hesitate to hurl brazen insults" at several feminists. In an interview, Paglia stated that to be effective, one has to "name names"; criticism should be concrete. Paglia stated that many critics "escape into abstractions", rendering their criticism "intellectualized and tame".<ref name="Rodden2001">{{cite book|first=John|last=Rodden|title=Performing the Literary Interview: How Writers Craft Their Public Selves|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzMemaK2RMEC&pg=PA167|year=2001|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=0-8032-3939-4|page=174}}</ref>

Paglia accused Greer of becoming "a drone in three years" as a result of her early success; Paglia has also criticized the work of activist Diana Fuss.<ref name="time-1992-01-13"/> [[Elaine Showalter]] calls Paglia "unique in the hyperbole and virulence of her hostility to virtually all the prominent feminist activists, public figures, writers and scholars of her generation", mentioning [[Carolyn Heilbrun]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Carol Gilligan]], [[Marilyn French]], [[Zoe Baird]], [[Kimba Wood]], [[Susan Thomases]], and [[Hillary Clinton]] as targets of her criticism.<ref name= Showalter /> Paglia has accused [[Kate Millett]] of starting "the repressive, [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] style in feminist criticism."<ref name="Salon-1999-06-05">{{Cite news |title=Kate Millett, the ambivalent feminist |first=Leslie |last=Crawford |newspaper=Salon |date=June 5, 1999 |url=http://www.salon.com/people/feature/1999/06/05/millet/print.html}}</ref> Paglia has repeatedly criticized [[Patricia Ireland]], former president of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), calling her a "sanctimonious", unappealing role model for women<ref>{{cite web|first=Camille|last=Paglia|url=http://www.salon.com/april97/columnists/paglia970429.html |title=Why I Go for Women with Big Beaks |website=[[Salon.com]]|publisher=[[Salon Media Group]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=April 29, 1997 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230063354/http://www.salon.com/april97/columnists/paglia970429.html |archive-date=December 30, 2008 }}</ref> whose "smug, arrogant" attitude is accompanied by "painfully limited processes of thought".<ref>{{cite web | first=Camille|last=Paglia|url = http://208.17.81.135/col/pagl/1997/10/14frames.html | title = Men and their Discontents | website=[[Salon.com]]|publisher=[[Salon Media Group]]|location=San Francisco, California|date = October 14, 1974 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.today/20100427052432/http://208.17.81.135/col/pagl/1997/10/14frames.html | archive-date = April 27, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Paglia contends that under Ireland's leadership, NOW "damaged and marginalized the women's movement".<ref>{{cite web |first=Camille|last=Paglia |url=http://archive.salon.com/people/col/pagl/2000/12/06/year_end/print.html |title=The Peevish Porcupine Beats the Shrill Rooster |website=[[Salon.com]] |publisher=[[Salon Media Group]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=December 6, 2000 |accessdate=June 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206142246/http://archive.salon.com/people/col/pagl/2000/12/06/year_end/print.html |archive-date=February 6, 2009  }}</ref>

In 1999, [[Martha Nussbaum]] wrote an essay called "The Professor of Parody", in which she criticized [[Judith Butler]] for retreating to abstract theory disconnected from real world problems.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Robert|last1=Boynton|title=Who Needs Philosophy?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/21/magazine/who-needs-philosophy.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=November 21, 1999|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}</ref> Paglia reacted to the essay by stating that the criticism was "long overdue", but characterized the criticism as "one [[Political correctness|PC]] diva turning against another". She criticized Nussbaum for failing to make her criticisms earlier while accusing her of borrowing Paglia's ideas without acknowledgement. She called Nussbaum's "preparation or instinct for sex analysis&nbsp;... dubious at best", but nevertheless stated that "Nussbaum is a genuine scholar who operates on a vastly higher intellectual level than Butler".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.salon.com/it/col/pagl/1999/02/24pagl.html|  title = Butler vs. Nussbaum | website = [[Salon.com]] | publisher=[[Salon Media Group]]|location=San Francisco, California|date = February 24, 1999}}</ref>

Many feminists have criticized Paglia; [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] calls her "Perhaps the most conspicuous target of feminist opprobrium," noting that the ''Women's Review of Books'' described ''Sexual Personae'' as [[patriarchy]]'s "counter-assault on feminism". Sommers relates that when Paglia appeared at a [[Brown University]] forum, feminists signed a petition censuring her and demanding an investigation into procedures for inviting speakers to the campus.<ref name=Sommers>{{Citation | last = Sommers | first = Christina Hoff | title = Who Stole Feminism?

Paglia's view that rape is sexually motivated has been endorsed by [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] [[Randy Thornhill]] and [[Craig T.

In an essay critiquing the Hollywood/celebrity fad of "Girl Squads", made popular in 2015 by pop-icons like [[Taylor Swift]], Paglia argued that rather than empowering women the cliquish practice actually harms the self-esteem of those who aren't rich, famous, or attractive enough to belong to the group, while further defining women only by a very narrow, often sexualized stereotype. She challenged that to be truly empowering, these groups need to mentor, advise, and be more inclusive, for more women to realize their true, individual potential.<ref>{{cite news | last = Paglia | first = Camille | title = Camille Paglia Takes on Taylor Swift, Hollywood's #GirlSquad Culture | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/camille-paglia-takes-taylor-swift-845827 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date = October 12, 2015 }}</ref>

He says she achieved phenomenal success when she called Foucault a "bastard", thereby providing (together with [[Alan Sokal]]'s ''[[Social Text]]'' parody) the best evidence for [[Paul de&nbsp;Man]]'s view that theory should be defined negatively, based on the opposition it arouses.<ref name=Cusset>{{Citation | last = Cusset | first = François | title = French Theory: How Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze & Co.

She has called [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949) "brilliant" and identified [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s work as part of a high period in literature. Paglia has praised [[Roland Barthes]]' ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' (1957) and [[Gilles Deleuze]]'s ''[[Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty]]'' (1967), while finding both men's later work flawed. Of [[Gaston Bachelard]], who influenced Paglia, she wrote "[his] dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method seemed to me ideal for art", adding that he was "the last modern French writer I took seriously".{{Sfn|Paglia|1992|p=243}}{{Sfn|Paglia|1994|p=232}}<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.salon.com/july97/columnists/paglia2970722.html |title=Of Versace and killer prom queens |page=2 |date=July 22, 1997 |newspaper=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411071450/http://www.salon.com/july97/columnists/paglia2970722.html |archive-date=April 11, 2008 }}</ref>

Unfortunately, Ms. Paglia has a way of undermining her more interesting arguments with flip, hyperbolic declarations".<ref>{{cite news | first = Michiko | last = Kakutani | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/books/books-of-the-times-the-rise-of-a-self-proclaimed-phenomenon.html | title = The Rise of a Self-Proclaimed Phenomenon | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date = November 15, 1994|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}</ref>

===''The Birds''===
In 1998, in commemoration of the 35th anniversary of the release of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'', the [[British Film Institute]] commissioned Paglia to write a book about the film. The book interprets the film as "in the main line of British Romanticism descending from the raw nature-tableaux and sinister femme-fatales of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]".<ref>{{cite book|first=John P.|last=McCombe|chapter=The Birds and Hitchcock's Hyper-Romantic Vision|editor1-first=Marshall|editor1-last=Deutelbaum|editor2-first=Leland A.|editor2-last=Poague|title=A Hitchcock Reader|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|date=March 10, 2009|isbn=978-1405155571|page=266}}</ref> Paglia uses a [[psychoanalytic]] framework to interpret the film as portraying "a release of primitive forces of sex and appetite that have been subdued but never fully tamed".<ref>McCombe p.267</ref>

He also praises her pedagogical slant towards basic interpretation, suggesting that her approach might be what is required to reinvigorate studies in the humanities.<ref name="epoch-2005-05-17">
