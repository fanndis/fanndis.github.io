'''Fifth Harmony''', often shortened to '''5H''', is an American [[girl group]] based in [[Miami]], composed of [[Ally Brooke]], [[Normani]], [[Dinah Jane]], [[Lauren Jauregui]], and previously [[Camila Cabello]] until her departure from the group in December 2016. The group signed a joint record deal with [[Simon Cowell]]'s label [[Syco Music|Syco Records]] and [[L.A. Reid]]'s label [[Epic Records]] after forming and finishing third in the [[The X Factor (U.S. season 2)|second season]] of the American singing competition series ''[[The X Factor (U.S. TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2012. Rising to prominence by social media, the group's debut [[extended play]] and their three studio albums all charted within the top ten of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States.

Following their exit from ''The X Factor'', they released their debut single "[[Miss Movin' On]]", preceding their extended play ''[[Better Together (EP)|Better Together]]'', certified gold in the United States. Its music video won the group the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|MTV Video Music Award for Artist to Watch]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1910194/Fifth-harmony-artist-to-watch-vma/ |title=See Fifth Harmony Melt Down Onstage After VMA Win |date=August 24, 2014 |website=MTV}}</ref> The group released their debut studio album ''[[Reflection (Fifth Harmony album)|Reflection]]'' in 2015, also receiving a gold certification in the country.<ref name="headlineplanet.com">{{Cite web |url=http://headlineplanet.com/home/2016/02/01/Fifth-harmonys-reflection-halseys-badlands-certified-gold-in-the-us/ |title=Fifth Harmony's "Reflection," Halsey's "Badlands" Certified Gold As RIAA Adds Track Sales, Streams |website=Headline Planet |language=en-US |access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref> The album included the singles "[[Boss (Fifth Harmony song)|Boss]]", "[[Sledgehammer (Fifth Harmony song)|Sledgehammer]]" and "[[Worth It (Fifth Harmony song)|Worth It]]". The latter achieved triple platinum certification in the United States and reached the top-ten in thirteen countries.

==Career==
===2012: ''The X Factor''===
In 2012, Ally Brooke, Camila Cabello, Normani Kordei, Dinah Jane and Lauren Jauregui auditioned as solo contestants on the [[The X Factor (U.S. season 2)|second season]] of the American televised singing competition ''[[The X Factor (U.S. TV series)|The X Factor]]''. The latter four failed to progress in the "Teens" category, with Brooke failing to enter the "Young Adults" category. However they were later brought back and put together to form a five-piece girl group at [[Miami Beach Convention Center|The Fillmore]], in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] on July 27, thus qualifying for the "Groups" category. Judges [[Demi Lovato]], [[L.A. Reid]], [[Britney Spears]] and [[Simon Cowell]] helped form the group.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harp|first1=Justin|title=Britain's Got Talent: Watch Fifth Harmony rock your world with a live semi-final performance|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/britains-got-talent/news/a795627/britains-got-talent-watch-Fifth-harmony-live-semi-final-performance/|website=Digital Spy|access-date=June 22, 2017}}</ref> For their qualifying song at the "judges' houses", and their first song as a group, Fifth Harmony sang an acoustic version of "[[Impossible (Shontelle song)|Impossible]]" by [[Shontelle]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gratereaux|first1=Alexandra J.|title=The X Factor: Marc Anthony, Simon Cowell Blown Away by Group Talent|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/10/11/x-factor-marc-anthony-simon-cowell-take-on-group-talent.html|website=Fox News|access-date=June 22, 2017}}</ref> Afterwards, [[Marc Anthony]] called the performance "unbelievable" with Cowell sharing similar sentiments saying that they were "clearly one great group". Initially, the group's name was "Lylas" (an [[acronym]] for Love You Like a Sister), but another group called "The Lylas" (which consists of four of [[Bruno Mars]]' sisters) claimed that the show stole their name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2012/10/25/bruno-mars-my-sisters-picking-a-fight-with-x-factor-singers/|title=Bruno Mars Sisters Picking Fight with 'X Factor' Singers|publisher=[[TMZ (website)|TMZ]]|access-date=October 26, 2012}}</ref> Thereafter, Lylas changed their name to 1432 (a [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] term for I Love You Too), which was announced on the first live show on October 31, during which 1432 performed "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]" by [[Taylor Swift]]. Cowell and Reid were critical of the new name, and Cowell suggested that the group be renamed again. During the first live results show on November 1, 1432 performed "[[Skyscraper (song)|Skyscraper]]" by Demi Lovato in a sing-off with three-piece girl group Sister C. Cowell decided to send 1432 through to the Top 12 and announced that they would be renamed via the viewers online. The name chosen by the public was announced: "Fifth Harmony".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wetpaint.com/x-factor/articles/what-is-x-factors-girl-group-lylas-aka-1432s-new-name/|title=What Is X Factor's Girl Group LYLAS (aka 1432)'s New Name?|last=Wayne|first=Julia|publisher=[[Wetpaint]]|date=November 7, 2012|access-date=September 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016141130/http://www.wetpaint.com/x-factor/articles/what-is-x-factors-girl-group-lylas-aka-1432s-new-name|archive-date=October 16, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the semi-finals stage of the show, the group performed [[Ellie Goulding]]'s "[[Anything Could Happen]]" as well as "Impossible" for the second time during the competition. However, their performance of "Impossible" received mostly negative reviews from the judges because the group had previously performed the song at Cowell's home (although not on ''The X Factor'' concert stage). Three members of the group (Camila, Lauren, and Ally) sang parts of the song in fluent Spanish. The following night's public vote results advanced Fifth Harmony to the final three along with [[Tate Stevens]] and [[Carly Rose Sonenclar]]. On the Top three live show, Fifth Harmony performed "Anything Could Happen" for the second time as their "Song of the Series" song. Their second song was a duet with ''The X Factor'' judge [[Demi Lovato]] singing "[[Give Your Heart a Break]]". Their final song of the night (and their last on the show) was "[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]" by [[The Beatles]], billed as their "$5&nbsp;million song". After the first round of the finals, they did not receive enough votes from the public to advance to the Top two, and they finished in third place on December 20, 2012.
