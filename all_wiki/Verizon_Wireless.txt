In late 2014, it became known that Verizon Wireless uses [[deep packet inspection]] for server-side insertion of a customer-unique ID field ("X-UIDH") into all unencrypted HTTP headers. The mechanism has been referred to as "[[supercookie]]" or "perma-cookie", although it is not technically a cookie in that it does not store information on the customers device and is transparent to the user. It can not be averted with common mechanisms like ad-blockers; however it can not be inserted into encrypted [[HTTPS]] and [[VPN]] connections. Verizon advertises the system to marketing partners. The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] has called on Verizon to terminate the program, calling it a "profound violation of trust", expressing concern over abuse by third parties, and questioning the legality of Verizon modifying their users' outgoing data without offering them the possibility of a full opt-out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/verizon-x-uidh|title=Verizon Injecting Perma-Cookies to Track Mobile Customers, Bypassing Privacy Controls|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lessonslearned.org/sniff|title=Checking known AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, Bell Canada & Vodacom Unique Identifier beacons|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/verizon-atandt-tracking-their-users-with-super-cookies/2014/11/03/7bbbf382-6395-11e4-bb14-4cfea1e742d5_story.html|title=Verizon, AT&T tracking their users with 'supercookies'|first=Craig|last=Timberg|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/which-apps-and-browsers-protect-you-against-verizon-and-turns-non-consensual|title=Which Apps Protect Against Verizon and Turn's Invasive User Tracking?|first=Peter|last=Eckersley|date=January 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/att-ditches-tracking-header-program-verizon-still-refuses|title=AT&T Ditches Tracking Header Program; Verizon Still Refuses|first=Jacob|last=Hoffman-Andrews|date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> In January 2015, Verizon announced they would give customers the option of opting out, and since April 1, 2015, Verizon has allowed customers to opt-out, either online or by calling a special phone number.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Verizon lets customers opt out of program that inserted 'super cookie' to track mobile browsing|url = http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/verizon-lets-customers-opt-out-program-inserted-super-cookie-track-mobile-b/2015-04-01|website = FierceWireless|accessdate = May 11, 2015}}</ref>

In February 2017, in the wake of competition from [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]], and initiatives to expand the capacity and improve the quality of its network by using [[macrocell]]s and supporting carrier aggregation, Verizon announced that it would bring back an "unlimited" data plan (subject to throttling in heavy network areas after 22&nbsp;GB of usage).

The department reported that a Verizon Wireless customer service representative insisted that they must upgrade to a higher-cost data plan in order to restore their internet speed.
