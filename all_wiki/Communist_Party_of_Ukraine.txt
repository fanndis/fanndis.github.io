The '''Communist Party of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Комуністична партія України}}, ''Komunistychna Partiya Ukrayiny'',  '''KPU''') is a [[Political parties in Ukraine|Ukrainian political party]] founded in 1993 as the successor to the Soviet-era [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] which was banned in 1991. The party played a major role in the parliamentary politics of post-Soviet Ukraine from its founding, but since the April 2015 [[decommunization in Ukraine|Ukrainian decommunization law]], the [[Ministry of Justice of Ukraine|Ministry of Justice]] has legally prohibited the Communist Party from participating in elections.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

[[Communist party|Communist parties]] have a long history in [[Ukraine]]. With the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the party's predecessor [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] was banned in 1991, reforming into [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] and other smaller parties. After being revived in 1993, the Communist Party was represented in the [[Ukrainian parliament]] from 1994 until the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] which resulted in national representation for Communists in Ukraine ending for the first time since [[1918 Ukrainian Constituent Assembly election|1918]].<ref name=ddcad/><ref name="General official results of Rada election 2014">[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233747.html General official results of Rada election], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (11 November 2014)<br />[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233696.html Central Election Commission announces official results of Rada election on party tickets], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (11 November 2014)</ref> The Communist Party and its immediate predecessor emerged as the largest political force after each Ukrainian parliamentary election from [[1990 Ukrainian Supreme Soviet election|1990]] until [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2002]] and until the aftermath of the [[Orange Revolution]] in 2004 the Communist Party was continuously the largest single party in the Ukrainian parliament.

In the aftermath of the 2013–2014 [[Euromaidan]] protests, the [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine]] and the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] have both filed charges against the party.

== History ==
{{details|Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)}}
The KPU formally considers itself the direct descendant of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]], a branch of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) which was founded on 5 July 1918, in Moscow.{{sfn|Bozoki|Ishiyama|2002|p=401}} The original communist party existed until 6 November 1991, when the CPSU and its branch in Ukraine were banned.{{sfn|Bozoki|Ishiyama|2002|p=401}} Between 1991 and 1993, several small communist organizations were created throughout Ukraine.{{sfn|Bozoki|Ishiyama|2002|p=401}} "Without clear legality", communists from all over Ukraine convened on 6 March 1993 for the All-Ukrainian Conference for Communists in an attempt to reestablish the KPU.{{sfn|Bozoki|Ishiyama|2002|p=402}} In reaction, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] legalized the establishment of communist parties two months later.{{sfn|Bozoki|Ishiyama|2002|p=402}} On 19 June 1993, the 1st Congress of the newly founded KPU was convened. Officially, it was designated as the 29th Congress to denote it as a direct successor to the Soviet KPU and it elected [[Petro Symonenko]] as First Secretary.{{sfn|Bozoki|Ishiyama|2002|p=402}}

In the [[1994 Ukrainian presidential election|1994 presidential election]], the KPU supported the candidacy of [[Oleksandr Moroz]] from the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] (SPU).{{sfn|Bozoki|Ishiyama|2002|p=402}} The relationship between the KPU and SPU was strong throughout the 1990s, with Moroz even speaking to the 22nd KPU Congress (held in 1999).{{sfn|Bozoki|Ishiyama|2002|p=402}} In the [[1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1998 parliamentary election]], the KPU won 121 seats, constituting 19.5% of the seats in the Verkhovna Rada.{{sfn|Bozoki|Ishiyama|2002|p=402}} The good result led the KPU to field their own candidate in the [[1999 Ukrainian presidential election|1999 presidential election]] as they nominated party leader Symonenko.{{sfn|Bozoki|Ishiyama|2002|p=402}} Symonenko received 23.1 percent of the votes in the first round, trailing behind [[Leonid Kuchma]] who received 38,0 percent of the votes.{{sfn|Bozoki|Ishiyama|2002|pp=403–404}} In the second round Symonenko received 38,8 percent, losing to Kuchma who received 57,7 percent of the vote.{{sfn|Bozoki|Ishiyama|2002|pp=403–404}}

In 2000, two parties split from the party, namely the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (renewed)]] and the [[Communist Party of Workers and Peasants]].<ref name="cbsis24715">[http://www.rferl.mobi/a/ukraine-communist-party-barred-from-local-elections/27150657.html Ukraine Bars Communists From Elections], [[Radio Free Europe]] (24 July 2015)</ref>

In February 2014, the party came out in firm opposition to the [[Euromaidan]] (pro-[[Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement|Ukrainian EU integration]] and anti-President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] protests) violence and identified the movement as a "coup" to overthrow the elected government and replace it with a pro-[[NATO]] regime and in an open plea from the First Secretary called for all [[communism|communist]] and [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] movements around the world to condemn the events as such.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-PP8SlF2WQEckh4NVIyVXNwUGJNTDBxYWpVZnYwZWphWmo0/edit?pli=1|title=Обращение_к_иностранным_партиям_2_(eng.).pdf|work=Google Docs|access-date=16 February 2015}}</ref> However, the party did vote in favour of the impeachment of Yanukovych.<ref name="w1.c1.rada.gov.ua"/>

=== Views of the party's ban legitimacy ===
According to a [[Kyiv Polytechnic]] professor who published an article in ''The Guardian'' stating that after the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]], the party came into conflict with the Ukrainian government due to prominent displays of support for ousted Ukrainian President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] during the [[Euromaidan]] protests and alleged involvement with the [[2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine|separatist movement]] in [[Eastern Ukraine]] as well as the party's pro-[[Russian government]] agenda.<ref name=ukctec/> However, the party did vote in favour of the impeachment of Yanukovych.<ref name="w1.c1.rada.gov.ua">[http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/radan_gs09/ns_golos?g_id=3863 Parliamentary vote on the draft resolution on the withdrawal of President of Ukraine to fulfill constitutional powers (number 4193) - as a basis and as a whole] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312210622/http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/radan_gs09/ns_golos?g_id=3863 |date=March 12, 2014 }}, [[Verkhovna Rada]]</ref> Two days after the Ukrainian parliament changed its regulations regarding the required size of parliamentary groups, the Communist Party faction was dissolved on 24 July 2014.<ref name="dissolvCPUiVR">[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/215171.html Turchynov dissolves Ukrainian Communist Party faction in parliament], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (24 July 2014)</ref>

According to political scientist Tadeusz A.

== Ideology ==
In its statute, the Communist Party claims that "on voluntary basis it unites citizens of Ukraine who are supporters of the Communist idea".<ref name="program">[http://www.kpu.ua/uk/page/programmakpu Party program]. Communist Party of Ukraine official website.</ref> The party considers itself a successor of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] of the [[Soviet Union]] and calls itself a "battle detachment of RKP(b)&ndash;VKP(b)&ndash;KPSS".<ref name=program/> The party claims that prohibition of that party in August 1991 was unlawful,<ref name=program/> which was confirmed by the decision of the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]] on 27 December 2001. The party sets itself in an opposition to any government and seeks a full restoration of the [[socialist state]] in the country without any particular association with any other political parties.<ref name=program/>

=== Soviet legacy ===
The KPU was established as "the inheritor of the ideas and traditions of the KPU, as it existed until its banning in August 1991".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=30}} In general, the party has laid weight on [[nostalgia for the Soviet Union]] to gain votes.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=30}} In contrast to many parts of the former Soviet Union where leftist conservatives have tried to win votes by promoting local nationalism, the KPU supports a form of [[Soviet nationalism]],{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=30}} considering the establishment of an independent Ukraine as illegal.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=29}} The party has remained loyal to the legacy of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=31}} In 1998, to celebrate the would-be 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union it published ''Historical Thesis'', a text which painted a rosy picture of the former state.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=31}} The Soviet Union is barely criticized and controversial events such as the [[Great Purge]] and [[Holodomor]] are not mentioned in the party press.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=31}} There are some who are favorable to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s legacy, giving the impression that things "only began to go wrong with [[Nikita Khrushchev|[Nikita] Khrushchev's]] 'adventurism'".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=31}} Despite all this, when the Soviet Union and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) is criticized at all, the favored line is that the party and state lost their belief in key [[Leninism|Leninist principles]].{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=31}} [[Vladimir Lenin]], the founder of the Soviet Union, "is still considered [[sacrosanct]]" by the party and official pronouncements talk of the "Leninist Communist Party of Ukraine" and more precisely that the KPU continues "speaking in the words of Lenin".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=31}}

Symonenko has criticized the label of conservative on the KPU, stating that the party is not willing to abandon its own history.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=31}} He has referred to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] as "the tragic events of the recent past".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=31}} Further, the KPU believes the Soviet Union "was criminally destroyed".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=31}} The party believes that Ukraine has been living off the legacy of the Soviet Union since its independence.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=31}} However, certain concessions to the present have been made and at the 2nd KPU Congress it was stated that "it would be [[Utopian socialism|utopian]] to try and [[planned economy|revive a socio-economic system of different relations]], which existed in different conditions, under different principles and [[means of production|different organizations of production]] and distribution, [[Superstructure (Marxism)|different social-class structures of society]], a [[Class consciousness|different level of consciousness]]".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=32}}

=== Marxism ===
The party adheres and believes in the [[Marxism|Marxian concepts]] of [[class struggle]] and [[historical materialism]].{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=32}} Their ongoing belief in historical materialism cements their views that the [[socialist mode of production]] will still be the society of the future.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=32}} It could be said that the party believed stronger than ever in the possibility of a socialist future since the "careerists", symbolized by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Leonid Kravchuk]], were gone.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=32}}

The KPU believes that since the West has developed into a [[post-industrial society]], [[capitalism]] through [[globalization]] was actively "de-modernizing" Ukraine.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=32}} This was in their favor since de-modernization would lead to the reestablishment of a dominant [[proletariat|proletarian class]].{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=32}} As Vasyl Tereshchuk, a former party theoretician expelled in 2005, noted: "People are surviving on what they accumulated in the years of Soviet power: that is, they are not yet a classic proletariat as they still have much to lose (a flat, a car, a dacha, etc.). But their full proletarianization will come sooner or later".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=32}} Secondly, the dissolution of the Soviet Union directly led to the reestablishment of class antagonism in society.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=32}} This antagonism led to the [[Marx's theory of exploitation|exploitation]] of the proletariat by "a [[Bourgeoisie|comprador bourgeoisie]] [...] behind which stands [[Imperialism|world imperialism]] headed by the USA".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=32}} According to Symonenko, on this basis there was no chance for a [[social democracy|social democratic movement]] ever to develop in Ukraine.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=32}} The "softening of class antagonism in the West" which had led to the establishment of social democratic parties "was only possible because the local working class, as part of the 'golden billion', lived 'as parasites on the labour of the countries of the world periphery' to which Ukraine was rapidly being consigned. Ukraine could not expect any 'lessening of class 
antagonism, only the reverse".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|pp=32–33}} Symonenko appreciates the economical aid and partnership with [[China]] and calls to use [[Communist Party of China]] as the example, giving the country back to the working people, and "build our country into a strong country like China".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shehui.daqi.com/article/3409264.html|title=彻底被震撼：乌克兰共产党领袖竟如此大赞中国！(图)|access-date=16 February 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506213331/http://shehui.daqi.com/article/3409264.html|archive-date=6 May 2015}}</ref>

=== Views on nationalism ===
At least in the beginning, the party is best described as [[Soviet nationalism|Soviet nationalist]] (nationalist in the sense that they are nostalgic for the Soviet Union).{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=33}} As Yurii Solomatin, a member of parliament, noted in 2000, "we are Soviet communists; we are Soviet people; we are Soviet patriots".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=33}} The party continues speaking about the existence of a "[[Soviet people]]" and "Soviet homeland" and at the beginning no concessions were given to local [[Ukrainian nationalism]].{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=33}} There has been no talk of establishing a national communism unique to Ukraine and the 1st KPU Congress even criticized the notion of establishing a unique "Ukrainian communism".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=33}} Instead, the KPU has opted promoting Ukraine as a "bi-cultural state".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=33}} At the 1st KPU Congress, Symonenko told the delegates that "'the interests, rights and specific traits of one nation above those of other nations and nationalities', and in which 'the [[Ukrainian language]]' should not be 'over'-privileged, but left alone to enjoy 'its natural development, purged of the imposed language of the diaspora. The [[Russian language]], as the native language of half the population of Ukraine, [should be given] the status of a state language alongside Ukrainian".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=34}} Their views on nationalism is highly nostalgic. When the [[Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (UCP–CPSU), a loose organization of post-Soviet parties was formed, it was met with open arms.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=34}} However, when the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] proposed in 1995 to transform the organization into a modern-day [[Comintern]], the KPU opposed because of their Soviet nationalist views.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|pp=34–35}}

In recent years, their commitment to Soviet nationalism has been partially replaced with a vaguer [[Eurasianism|East Slavic nationalism]].{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=35}} Wishing not to reestablish a union with Russia "'as a protectorate of the Russian bourgeoisie", "the Ukrainian Communists have rediscovered the natural link from Soviet to East Slavic or Eurasian nationalism in the supposed common 'economic civilization' and proclivity for collective labour of all the East Slavic peoples".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=35}} As noted in the party journal ''Communist'', the "'Soviet man [...] did not emerge from nothing before him stood the courageous Slavic-Rusich, the labour-loving Ukrainian peasant, the self-sacrificing Cossack".{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=35}} At the 4th KPU Congress, the party conceded that Ukraine would not join any particular union as long as it weakened the country's sovereignty.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=45}}
 
Because of these views, Symonenko has been referred to as a [[Ukrainophobia|Ukrainophobe]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.unian.ua/politics/533863-eksperti-viznachili-naybilsh-aktivnih-ukrajinofobiv-chasiv-nezalejnosti.html | title = Експерти визначили найбільш активних українофобів часів Незалежності |trans-title=Experts defined the most active Ukrainophobes in times of the independence | publisher = [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]] | access-date = 22 February 2014 | date = 23 August 2011 |author1=Lesiv, K |author2=Yaschenko, A |author3=Mishchenko, M }}</ref> Symonenko made controversy in 2007 when he accused the Ukrainian nationalist figure [[Roman Shukhevych]] of [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborationism with the Nazi Germany]], for which the Pechersk District Court of Kyiv city declared Symonenko's statement as false and obligated Symonenko publicly to disprove the "myth" and pay all court fees.<ref name="shukhevych">{{cite web|url=http://www.istpravda.com.ua/short/2011/02/18/25493/|title=Син Шухевича нагадав Литвину, що Симоненко має вибачитися за брехню про Гітлера |trans-title=Son of Shukhevych reminded Lytvyn that Symonenko has to apologize for the lie about Hitler|work=[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]|date=18 February 2011|access-date=12 February 2014}}</ref> However, these views are commonplace amongst Western historians, linking Shukhevych to the [[Nachtigall Battalion]].<ref>"Die Kollaboration in der Ukraine", Christoph Dieckmann, Babette Quinkert, Tatjana Tönsmeyer (eds.), ''Kooperation und Verbrechen.

The first ten members on the party list were [[Petro Symonenko]] ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MP]]), Omelian Parubok ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MP]]), Anatoliy Nalyvaiko (tunneler of the Karl Marks Mine ([[Yenakieve]])), Borys Oliynyk ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MP]]), Valeria Zaklunna-Myronenko (actress of the [[Lesya Ukrainka National Academic Theater of Russian Drama|Lesya Ukrainka Theater]] ([[Kyiv]])), [[Adam Martynyuk]] (the 2nd secretary of the Central Committee of CPU), Anatoliy Draholyuntsev (mechanic-electrician at [[Luhanskteplovoz]]), Vasyl Sirenko (Koretsky Institute of State and Law ([[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|NANU]]), unaffiliated), Borys Molchanov (tool craftsman at Dniproshyna) and Anatoliy Strohov (pensioner).

At the [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] on 30 March 2002, the party won 19.98%<ref name=DATA/> of the popular vote and 66 out of 450 seats in the [[Verkhovna Rada]]. The first ten members on the party list were [[Petro Symonenko]] ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MP]]), Omelian Parubok ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MP]]), [[Ivan Herasymov]] (Head of the Veterans of Ukraine Organization, unaffiliated), Borys Oliynyk ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MP]]), Valeria Zaklunna-Myronenko ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MP]]), [[Adam Martynyuk]] ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MP]]), [[Stanislav Hurenko]] ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MP]]), [[Oleksandr Tkachenko (politician)|Oleksandr Tkachenko]] ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MP]]), Anatoliy Nalyvaiko ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MP]]) and [[Oleh Blokhin]] ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MP]], unaffiliated).
