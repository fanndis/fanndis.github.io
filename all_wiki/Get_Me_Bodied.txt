'''"Get Me Bodied"''' is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] for her second solo studio album ''[[B'Day (Beyoncé album)|B'Day]]'' (2006). It was written by Beyoncé, [[Swizz Beatz|Kasseem "Swizz Beatz" Dean]], [[Sean Garrett]], [[Makeba Riddick]], Angela Beyincé, and [[Solange Knowles]], while the production was handled by Dean, Beyoncé and Garrett. Beyoncé was inspired by her sister Solange and former [[Destiny's Child]] bandmates [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] for the writing process. [[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]] released "Get Me Bodied" as the album's sixth and final single in the United States on July 10, 2007.

"Get Me Bodied" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Bounce music|bounce]] song with [[dancehall]] and [[reggae]] influences. It features Beyoncé as the female protagonist going out an evening in the right dress and the right hair, to steam up any dancefloor and make sure her call to "get her bodied" is irresistible. The song was generally well received by [[Music journalism|contemporary music critics]], who complimented its party sound and Beyoncé's vocals. The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) recognized it as the best R&B and hip-hop song of 2007. "Get Me Bodied" initially reached number sixty-eight on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] in 2007, but due to a viral video reached a new peak of forty-six in 2013.

Its accompanying [[music video]] was co-directed by Beyoncé and [[Anthony Mandler]], and inspired by [[The Frug]] from [[Bob Fosse]]'s film adaptation of the Broadway [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Sweet Charity]]''. Solange, Rowland, and Williams make cameo appearances. The video was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2007 [[VH1|VH1 Soul Vibe Awards]]. "Get Me Bodied" was promoted by Beyoncé with live performances on her world tours and at the [[BET Awards 2007|2007 BET Awards]]. In April 2011, Beyoncé re-recorded the song and retitled it as "Move Your Body" for the [[Let's Move! Flash Workout]] campaign. An instructional video of the exercise routine was filmed for distribution to participating schools.

===Synopsis===
[[Image:Get Me Bodied Screenshot.png|right|thumb|275px|[[Solange Knowles]], Beyoncé, [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] in the music video of "Get Me Bodied".|alt=Four women, all dressed with gray gowns and soft make-up, shelter from the rain under a black-and-white umbrella.]]
The video begins with Beyoncé writing the sequence 9-4-8-1 and B'Day on the mirror with her lipstick. As the song begins, she briefly dances in a silver dress around a red room and later answers a telephone on a black couch. She, Solange, Rowland and Williams then walk across a multi-colored room to a black door where they all pose for the camera. As the chorus begins, Beyoncé, Solange, Rowland and Williams step out of a black [[limousine]]; they are all sporting matching silver dresses. They execute some dance steps as they walk inside, where people are partying. As the chorus ends, the song is paused while Beyoncé enters a room, where everyone begin to ask who she is, before she answers, "It's B!" and snaps her fingers to start back the music.

She then walks past several people, dances with several men and women in white and black suits and dresses, as the second chorus begins. Beyoncé and the dancers perform a dance routine together, and soon she meets a man, who dances with her. A particular scene shows all the dancers crouch down to the floor, and follow Beyoncé as she walks, before she blows them back.  The bridge starts, and the video moves to Beyoncé in a red room, where she and her dancers dance in short skirts, fishnets and black sparkling dresses. The group is later dance in the red and white rooms together. Leading into the final chorus, Beyoncé dances back in the room with the dancers, while Rowland, Williams and her sister sit on a black couch. As the video ends, Beyoncé stands in front of the mirror she was at the start and fades to black as she stares at the viewer through it.

Direct references to the "Rich Man's Frug" include a nearly shot-for-shot recreation of the "who is it?" introduction, the cage and Greek sculptures surrounding a large stage, the two ladies back-to-back parting to reveal Beyonce with two male dancers, and many dance steps from "The Heavyweight" portion of Fosse's choreography.

===Reception===
[[MTV]]'s Tamar Anitai reviewed the video positively, describing it as a "swashbuckling showstopper" and adding, "But, sorry ladies, B shines brightest front and center, looking glittery, glorious and, of course, gorgeous, and more glam than ever before."<ref name="Buzz" /> Anitai further wrote that the "seriously sick" dance sequence in the video spans the history of late 20th-century [[modern dance]], from [[Jerome Robbins]], Bob Fosse, [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Fatima Robinson]]. He added that the video showcases Beyoncé's [[metamorphosis]] into a "highly sophisticated" dancer, and one who can seriously shake it in sky-high stilettos to boot.<ref name="Buzz" /> Anitai concluded his review by writing that Beyoncé unveiled her onstage [[alter ego]] [[I Am... Sasha Fierce|Sasha Fierce]] for the mini movie with "epic" dance scenes while channeling her inner [[Lena Horne]], [[Chita Rivera]] and [[Tina Turner]].<ref name="Buzz" /> The music video for "Get Me Bodied" was nominated in the category for Video of the Year at the 2007 VH1 Soul Vibe Awards.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beyoncé and Jay-Z Lead the Pack of ASCAP Members Nominated for VH1 Soul Vibe Awards |url=http://www.ascap.com/eventsawards/awards/vh1soulvibe/2007/nominees.html |publisher=[[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] |accessdate=February 1, 2011}}</ref> In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E!

Beyoncé reworked her original "Get Me Bodied" into a new song titled "Move Your Body" (2011).<ref name="MoveBodyMTVBuzz"/> She joined forces with [[United States First Lady|US First Lady]] [[Michelle Obama]] and the National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation to promote the national [[Let's Move!]] campaign, which aims to combat [[child obesity]] by prompting youngsters to become more active. Beyoncé actually reworked "Get Me Bodied" and renamed it "Move Your Body" for the [[Let's Move! Flash Workout]] initiative itself. A Spanish version was also created entitled "Mueve el Cuerpo".<ref name="ty"/> Concerning the campaign, Beyoncé expressed herself:

<blockquote>
"It's all about promoting the benefits of healthy eating and exercise... But what we want to do is make it fun by doing something that we all love to do, and that's dance. I am excited to be part of this effort that addresses a public health crisis. First Lady Michelle Obama deserves credit for tackling this issue directly, and I applaud the NAB Education Foundation for trying to make a positive difference in the lives of our schoolchildren."<ref name="rap-up2">{{cite web |url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/04/08/video-beyonce-wants-you-to-move-your-body/ |title=Beyoncé Wants To 'Move Your Body' |accessdate=April 9, 2011 |date=April 8, 2011 |work=Rap-Up |publisher=Devin Lazerine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popeater.com/2011/04/12/beyonce-move-your-body-video/ |title=Beyonce Lends Some Fancy Footwork to 'Move Your Body' Campaign |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |date=April 12, 2011 |work=PopEater|publisher=Devin Lazerine}}</ref>
