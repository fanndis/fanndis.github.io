== History ==
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
The first issue of ''Crain's Chicago Business'' is dated April 17, 1978.<ref name="adventure">{{cite book |last1=Goldsborough |first1=Robert |author-link1=Robert Goldsborough (writer) |title=The Crain Adventure |url=https://archive.org/details/crainadventurema0000gold |url-access=limited |year=1992|publisher=NTC Business Books |location=Lincolnwood, Illinois|isbn=0-8442-3485-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/crainadventurema0000gold/page/89 89]–94}}</ref> In 1977, when Crain Communications chief [[Rance Crain]] went to Houston to give a speech to the Houston Advertising Club, he spent an afternoon listening to the publisher of the ''Houston Business Journal'' explain how his publication was developed.  "I figured if a business publication worked well in Houston, it would be twice as successful in Chicago," Rance Crain said.

Rance Crain was the newspaper's first editor-in-chief, while [[Art Mertz]] (1917–1993), a longtime sales manager at Crain Communications' ''[[Advertising Age]]'' magazine, served as the first publisher.  Rance tapped Steve Yahn, a senior editor at ''Advertising Age'', to develop the prototype, do the initial hiring, and get the paper going, effectively acting as the paper's first editor.  "We wanted to call it ''Chicago Business'', but another guy came out with a paper with a similar name [which was short-lived]," Yahn said.  "I told Rance he ought to put the Crain name on our publication to differentiate them, and he did."<ref name="adventure" />

''Crain's'' was originally planned to publish every other week, but with the demise of the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' that year, those creating ''Crain's'' decided to make it a weekly publication, using the end of the ''Daily News'' for marketing purposes and also drawing on editorial talent from the failed paper.<ref name="adventure" />

The first newsstand issue of ''Crain’s Chicago Business'' appeared on Monday, June 5, 1978, a 46-page edition with an exclusive lead story on how the Marshall Field & Co. department store chain was planning further suburban expansion.<ref name="adventure" />

To promote the new paper, Rance handed out free issues to commuters at Union Station during the morning rush hour. “While I was passing out copies, a newsstand vendor in the station came up to me,” Rance recalled. “He said, ‘I sure hope you don’t have much of your own money tied up in this, because it’s not going to work.’”<ref name="adventure" />

The Chicago business community also greeted the new journal with cynicism. “We would be working on stories and call sources, saying we were with ''Crain’s Chicago Business'',” said Sandy Pesmen, feature editor at ''Crain's'' and former feature writer at the ''Daily News''. “They would say ‘Who? What? The people who make the toilets?’ Some thought we were the plumbing manufacturer [Crane Co.]. Pretty soon, we were introducing ourselves by saying, “Hello, this is so-and-so from ''C-R-A-I-N’s Chicago Business''.”<ref name="adventure" />

One of ''Crain's''’s biggest assets from the beginning was its physical appearance. “The first major sign of encouragement we got was for our lively, contemporary look,” Steve Yahn said. “A lot of people said it looked as much like a book about the city as a financial publication. And that was exactly the intent — ''Crain's'' was meant to be a ‘hybrid’ between a city publication and a financial publication.”<ref name="adventure" />

From the start, it strove to build its reputation with enterprise reporting. “Rance loves scoops,” former Crain's editor Dan Miller said. “And the ‘scoops mentality’ became immediately ingrained in the culture of the new reporters we brought in.”

However, one of those early scoops caused a firestorm that threatened to severely damage the new paper’s reputation. In late July, ''Crain's'' learned through sources in the Chicago advertising community that [[Sears|Sears, Roebuck & Co.]] planned to drastically curtail its advertising. The banner story on August 7, with the headline “Sears slashes TV, print ad budgets,” stated that cuts could reach the $100 million mark. The giant retailer angrily denied the report. “They called it preposterous,” Yahn said. “As a result, we suffered credibility problems around town. From early August until mid-October, we kept trying to find a way to get it back.”<ref name="adventure" />

[[File:CCB Archival Photo 2.JPG|thumb|left|Crain's Chicago Business editorial, June 5, 1978]]
Then came the break that stunningly and permanently reversed ''Crain's'' fortunes. “A young Sears public relations man named Wiley Brooks came to see Rance on a job interview,” Yahn said. “He wanted to be ''CCB'' managing editor [a slot that would open up according to plans when Dan Miller replaced Yahn as editor]. Brooks told Rance that our earlier article about Sears's ad cuts was true, that he had the proof, and that there was to be a massive reorganization of the company.”

Brooks's proof was a voluminous, secret five-year plan referred to informally at Sears as the “Yellow Book.” Brooks proceeded to leak the plan to ''Crain's'' in three sections. “Each one cost ''Crain’s'' a lunch at Nick’s Fishmarket [a pricey Chicago eatery],” Yahn said. “I still remember sprinting through the downtown streets with the first part of the book in a manila folder. Our whole reputation for accuracy was on the line.”<ref name="adventure" />

In a bylined piece by Yahn, ''Crain’s'' broke the story of Sears's secret plan on December 4 with a highly detailed 10-page package that included charts, graphs, and numerous sidebars drawn from the plan.<ref name="Sears">{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140122/BLOGS08/140129894/why-sears-faltered-check-out-this-1978-secret-plan | title=Why Sears faltered? Check out this 1978 'secret plan' | publisher=Crain Communications Inc. | work=Crain's Chicago Business | date=January 22, 2014 | access-date=January 8, 2015 | author=Galland, Zoe}}</ref> “It made our reputation,” Yahn said. “TV picked up on it in a big way on the weekend before we hit the streets. And on Monday, copies were gone by 9 A.M. and newsstands were calling for replacements. We were interviewed by BBC and covered by ''Business Week'', and ''Business Week'' was after us for original documents. Sears did not respond.”<ref name="adventure" />

''Crain's'' continued to go after exclusives aggressively. “Our idea was to scoop the dailies, to print news people hadn’t seen before,” Rance said. “We pursued middle-sized companies because the dailies weren’t covering them. We got great publicity for the Sears story; one national publication called us ‘feisty.’ In a way it changed the perception of the company. Here in Chicago, we weren't well-known, but as we started getting scoops, we build our identity in the city.”<ref name="adventure" />

Encouraged by the success of ''Crain’s Chicago Business'', its parent company followed with three more business tabloids, ''[[Crain Communications|Crain’s Cleveland Business]]'' (1980s), ''[[Crain Communications|Crain’s Detroit Business]]'' and ''[[Crain Communications|Crain’s New York Business]]'', which started within weeks of each other early in 1985.<ref name="adventure" />

In more recent years, ''Crain’s'' has continued to shift with the ever-evolving publishing world, making a push to an integrated print and digital newsroom. The paper has also expanded its coverage to include more political news, with an award-winning team, including reporters Tom Corfman, Greg Hinz and Rich Miller.<ref>{{cite web|last=Feder|first=Robert|title=Political guru Rich Miller joins Crain's|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2014/02/27/political-guru-rich-miller-joins-crains/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Feder|first=Robert|title=Crain's elects to get more political|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2013/12/07/crains-elects-to-get-more-political/}}</ref>  Crain's addition of Chicago sports business news, dining reviews, exercise features, and fashion reports also exemplifies how the paper has progressed as it seeks to compete with other city publications.

In 2012, ''Crain’s'' moved from 360 N. Michigan Avenue into its new headquarters in the Crain Communications Building at 150 N. Michigan Avenue, Chicago 60601.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/realestate/20110208/CRED03/110209870/crain-moving-chicago-offices-to-150-n-michigan|title=Crain moving Chicago offices to 150 N. Michigan|website=chicagobusiness.com}}</ref>

In June 2012, ''Crain's'' introduced a metered subscription plan for its website, also known as a paywall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20120526/ISSUE01/305269972/crains-introduces-subscription-plan|title=Crain's introduces subscription plan|website=chicagobusiness.com}}</ref>

== Staff ==

While Steve Yahn was ''Crain's'' founding editor, Dan Miller was quickly picked up from the failed ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' staff and named editor in November 1978. He stayed on as editor for ten years.

In 1989, Mark Miller was named editor of ''Crain's'', succeeding Dan Miller (no relation), who had left to oversee Crain Communications' ''City & State'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news |first=George |last=Lazarus |title=No-name strategy will give cigarette brand 2d chance |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=4 |date=January 11, 1989 }}</ref> Between 1982 and 1989, Mark Miller had been the managing editor of ''Crain's''.  Mark Miller served as ''Crain's'' editor from 1989 until leaving in 1993 to join the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' as deputy managing editor.

In 1993, current ''Crain's'' publisher, David Snyder became the editor. He held post until 2000 when he became general manager/interactive and directed the relaunch of the ''Crain's'' website, [http://www.chicagobusiness.com/ ChicagoBusiness.com].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2010/09/crains-chicago-business-names-david-snyder-to-replace-david-blake-as-publisher-oct-15.html | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Crain's Chicago Business names Snyder to replace Blake as publisher | date=2010-09-07}}</ref> Snyder started at ''Crain's'' as a beat reporter and was associate publisher before his promotion to his current role.

After numerous reporter positions, Robert Reed, became editor of ''Crain's'' from 2000–2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-01-06/business/0001060054_1_infinity-broadcasting-entercom-stations | work=Chicago Tribune | first=Jim | last=Kirk | title=Weezie Kramer Bolts, Shocks Wjmk Insiders | date=2000-01-06}}</ref>  Reed stayed in the job until leaving ''Crain's'' in early 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-10-21/business/0310210102_1_morning-show-radio-station-wckg | work=Chicago Tribune | first=Jim | last=Kirk | title=Manton, Wolf and WLUP-FM in chatter loop | date=2003-10-21}}</ref> He then moved to ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', Illinois Governor Pat Quinn's office and later led the investigative team at Chicago's [[Better Government Association]].  Reed now is a columnist for the Chicago Tribune.

In November 2003, the paper hired Jeff Bailey from the [[Wall Street Journal]]'s Chicago bureau to be the editor of ''Crain's''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-02-26/business/0502260261_1_crain-communications-business-publications-circulation | work=Chicago Tribune | first=Susan | last=Chandler | title=Crain's editor resigns, cites differences with publisher | date=2005-02-26}}</ref>

In February 2005, Bailey left ''Crain's'' after just 15 months in the job, telling his colleagues that he and the paper's publisher, David Blake, "did not get along well enough to be a team."<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com">{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-02-26/business/0502260261_1_crain-communications-business-publications-circulation|title=Crain's editor resigns, cites differences with publisher|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref> During Bailey's time at the helm, more than a half dozen veteran staffers left the paper, including [[Steven Strahler]] (who subsequently remained with the paper as a contract writer—a position he holds to this day) and Jeff Borden.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/> Bailey was replaced by the paper's longtime managing editor, Joseph B. Cahill.  Cahill remained editor until 2011, when he stepped down to become a general business columnist for ''Crain's''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-11-21/business/chi-cahill-out-as-editor-at-crains-20111121_1_crain-s-chicago-business-joseph-cahill-editorial-operations| work=Chicago Tribune | first=Robert | last=Channick | title=ahill leaving editor role | date=2011-11-21}}</ref> He is now a ''Crain's'' blogger and columnist.
