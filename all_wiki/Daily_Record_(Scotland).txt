The '''''Daily Record''''' is a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspaper]] based in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. It is published six days a week, and its sister paper is the ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]''.  As part of [[Reach plc]], it has a close kinship with the UK-wide ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', with major stories of British significance being reported in both titles.

The ''Daily Record'' and all "north of the border" newspapers owned by Trinity Mirror merged into a single entity that, as of late 2011, included 300 reporters working on 20 print titles and 36 websites.<ref>{{cite web|last=Murden|first=Terry|date=7 December 2011|title=Merger for all of Trinity Mirror’s Scots titles|url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/merger_for_all_of_trinity_mirror_s_scots_titles_1_1992109|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210084640/https://www.scotsman.com/web/20191210084640mp_/https://www.scotsman.com/business/companies/media-leisure/merger-for-all-of-trinity-mirror-s-scots-titles-1-1992109|archive-date=10 December 2019|website=[[The Scotsman]]}}</ref>

==History==
The ''Daily Record'' was founded in 1895. The ''[[North British Daily Mail]]'' ceased publication in 1901 and was then incorporated into the ''Daily Record'', which was renamed the ''Daily Record and Mail''. [[Lord Kemsley]] bought the paper for £1&nbsp;million in 1922, forming a controlling company known as Associated Scottish Newspapers Limited. Production was transferred from Renfield Lane to 67 Hope Street in 1926.

As of the British [[1970 United Kingdom general election|General Election of 1970]], the ''Daily Record'' and the Scottish ''Daily Express'' were "the two best-selling Scottish newspapers"<ref>{{cite book|last=Butler|first=David|title=The British General Election of 1970|last2=Pinto-Duschinsky|first2=Michael|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=1971|isbn=9780333121429|location=United Kingdom|page=461|author-link=David Butler (psephologist)|author-link2=Michael Pinto-Duschinsky}}</ref>

In 1971 the ''Daily Record'' became the first European newspaper to be printed with run-of-paper colour, and was the first British national to introduce computer page make-up technology. It was purchased by [[Trinity Mirror]] in 1999,<ref>{{Cite web|title=History|url=http://www.trinitymirror.com/our-company/history/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009024130/http://www.trinitymirror.com/our-company/history/|archive-date=9 October 2010|website=Trinity Mirror}}</ref> from the estate of [[Robert Maxwell]].

==Political involvement==
Politically, the ''Daily Record'' supported the [[conservatism|conservative]] [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist Party]] until the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]], when it switched its allegiance to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The paper continues to support the Labour Party and has a close relationship with it, including donating £10,000 to the party in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/snp-steps-up-its-borrowing-despite-big-donations-1.843313 |title=SNP steps up its borrowing despite big donations |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |publisher=Herald & Times Group |date=22 August 2007 }}</ref> It opposes both the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and [[Scottish independence]].

For many years there has been a close relationship between ''Daily Record'' journalists and Labour Party politicians in Scotland, and a revolving door between newspaper staff and Labour advisers. [[Helen Liddell, Baroness Liddell of Coatdyke|Helen Liddell]] went from being General Secretary of the Scottish Labour Party to being [[Robert Maxwell]]'s Head of Corporate Affairs at the ''Daily Record'' (1988–1991). Tom Brown worked as one of the ''Daily Record''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s highest-profile columnists (1982–2003) and served as its political editor, before advising his friend, First Minister [[Henry McLeish]]. Paul Sinclair was political editor of the ''Daily Record'' (2000–2005), before becoming a special advisor to [[Douglas Alexander]], and then to [[Gordon Brown]]. He has been [[Johann Lamont]]'s special adviser and official spokesperson since 2011.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hassan|first=Gerry|title=[[The Strange Death of Labour Scotland]]|last2=Shaw|first2=Eric|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780748640010|pages=215|author-link=Gerry Hassan}}</ref> Labour peer, and former MP and MSP, [[Michael Goodall Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie|Lord Watson of Invergowrie]] has reflected that 'the one paper no Labour MP or MSP can afford to ignore is the ''Daily Record'''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=Mike|title=Year Zero: An Inside View of the Scottish Parliament|publisher=[[Birlinn (publisher)|Polygon]]|year=2001|isbn=978-1902930268|pages=59}}</ref>

In July 2019, the ''Daily Record'' publicly announced its support for the decriminalisation of drug use.<ref>{{cite news |date= 16 July 2019 |title= Scotland's drug deaths set to top 1,000 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-48938509 |work= BBC News |access-date= 16 July 2019}}</ref> The newspaper spoke to doctors, politicians, academics, recovery groups and former drug addicts, the overwhelming majority it stated spoke of treating drugs as a health matter rather than a criminal one. The paper said that court convictions are punishing drug users for their addictions, they are given fines they can't afford to pay and jail terms that make their problems worse. It suggested that millions of pounds that are used to force addicts through courts and prison sentences could be redirected to tackling drug gangs and dealers. The paper also highlighted the use of [[supervised injection site|drug consumption facilities]], stating they encourage addicts into treatment, reduce the amount of heroin needles on city pavements, counter the spread of diseases such as HIV and save lives. However, it stated that such a properly serviced facility would not currently be able to be opened under UK law unless it was amended so that people who brought drugs into such facilities could not be criminalised for doing so. The paper said that the biggest route to progress is through properly funding harm reduction and rehab programmes.<ref>{{cite news |date= 4 July 2019 |title= It's time to decriminalise drug use to beat Scotland's crippling death crisis |url= https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/its-time-decriminalise-drug-use-17386758 |work= Daily Record |access-date= 16 July 2019}}</ref>
