==History==
''La Patilla'' was created by co-founder and former CEO of Globovisión, Alberto Federico Ravell. In 2010, the majority shareholders of the television station asked for the resignation of Ravell and the other directors of Globovision.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2010/02/11/pol_ava_alberto-federico-rav_11A3421293.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214091041/http://www.eluniversal.com/2010/02/11/pol_ava_alberto-federico-rav_11A3421293.shtml |archive-date=2010-02-14 |url-status=dead |title=Alberto Federico Ravell sale de la directiva de Globovisión, El Nacional }}</ref> On 11 June 2010, Ravell then created ''La Patilla''.

===Growth===
By 2017, ''La Patilla'' had grown to be among the top 5 most visited websites in Venezuela, with only Google, YouTube and Facebook being more popular in the country.<ref name=1APR17/>

The ''Wall Street Journal'' reported that Venezuelans "have been forced to find alternatives as newspapers and broadcasters struggle with [[Censorship in Venezuela|state efforts to control coverage]]", with a growing trend of Venezuelans using online news media to bypass government censors.<ref name="WSJcrackdown" /> Journalists and press-freedom advocates stated that news websites like ''La Patilla'' "have helped fill a gap" since those linked to the Venezuelan government had purchased media organizations in Venezuela, such as ''El Universal'', Globovisión and ''[[Ultimas Noticias]]''.<ref name="WSJcrackdown" /> In an article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' discussing the rising popularity of news websites in Venezuela, ''La Patilla'' CEO Ravell stated that, "The editorial line of ''La Patilla'' is to call it like it is ... We don't need paper. We don't need a broadcasting license. There's little they can do to squeeze us."<ref name="WSJcrackdown" />

==Demographics==
Initially after ''La Patilla'''s launch, its readership was primarily from [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate educated]] individuals. In 2015, ''La Patilla'' was primarily visited by those who were both college educated and not collegiately educated. One of the primary browsing locations for users was at school and at work.<ref name=Ajune2015>{{cite web|title=lapatilla.com |url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/www.lapatilla.com |website=Alexa |accessdate=17 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617064636/http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/www.lapatilla.com |archive-date=June 17, 2015 }}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=November 2020}} By 2018, visitors were primarily college educated or in graduate school, with homes and work places becoming the main browsing locations while visits from schools declined.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

== Reception ==
[[Freedom House]] described ''La Patilla'' as having a pro-opposition stance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2013/venezuela|title=Venezuela: Freedom On The Net|date=2013|work=Freedom on the Net 2013|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref> ''The Wall Street Journal'' described the website as a news aggregator.<ref name="WSJcrackdown" />

==Censorship==
{{more|Censorship in Venezuela}}
[[File:Netblocks-venezuela-wikipedia-block.png|thumb|Netblocks showing the censorship of websites including La Patilla and Wikipedia by CANTV]]
On 17 May 2012, ''La Patilla'' was covering violent clashes occurring at a Venezuelan prison, [[La Planta]], through a [[live stream]] video feed. Visitors of ''La Patilla'' reported that the website was experiencing "irregularities" and thought it was due to technical problems. It was discovered later that ''La Patilla'' was blocked by the government-run [[CANTV]]. CANTV blocked ''La Patilla'''s original [[IP address]] and after ''La Patilla'' changed its IP address, CANTV blocked it again. Readers of ''La Patilla'' criticized the blockage by CANTV saying it was a "violation of their right to information". Readers also assumed the blockage by the government was due to the coverage of the prison clashes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cantv, proveedor de internet del Estado venezolano, bloquea portal de noticias ''La Patilla''|url=http://noticiasmontreal.com/41972/proveedor-de-internet-del-estado-venezolano-bloquea-portal-de-noticias-la-patilla/|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=Noticias Montreal|date=17 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cantv bloquea la página web ''La Patilla''|url=http://globovision.com/articulo/cantv-bloquea-la-pagina-web-la-patilla|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=Globovision|date=17 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lapatilla.com denuncia bloqueo a usuarios en Cantv|url=http://www.elmundo.com.ve/noticias/tecnologia/internet/lapatilla-com-denuncia-bloqueo-a-usuarios-en-cantv.aspx|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=El Mundo|date=17 May 2012}}</ref> David Moran, editor of ''La Patilla'' stated that "Censorship has been multidimensional against us".<ref name=ENHblockage/>

Weeks after the [[2018 Venezuelan presidential election|Venezuelan presidential election in 2018]], ''La Patilla'' had their [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] censored from 6 June 2018 to 11 June 2018 by the state-run CANTV and private internet service providers who were complying with government regulations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2018/06/12/los-bloqueos-de-la-patilla-y-el-nacional-revelaron-una-nueva-forma-de-censura-en-internet/|title=Los bloqueos de ''La Patilla'' y El Nacional revelaron una nueva forma de censura en internet|website=La Patilla|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> Since June 2018, CANTV has blocked access to ''La Patilla''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/2018/08/24/cantv-continua-el-bloqueo-a-la-patilla/|title=Cantv continúa el bloqueo a ''La Patilla''|date=2018-08-24|work=La Patilla|access-date=2018-08-24|language=es-ES}}</ref>

==Attacks on reporters==
On 22 April 2014, reporters from ''La Patilla'', who were covering events in Santa Fe, were retained by the National Guard. The reporters were accused of being "fake journalists", had to show their ID's to the National Guardsmen and had their pictures taken. They were later released without further complications.<ref>{{cite news|title=GNB retuvo y fichó a fotógrafos de lapatilla (Video)|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/04/23/asi-retuvieron-y-ficharon-a-fotografos-de-lapatilla-video/|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=La Patilla|date=23 April 2014}}</ref> On 12 May 2014, a photojournalist from ''La Patilla'' was assaulted by National Police who tried to take his camera and hit him in the head with the [[Stock (firearms)|butt]] of a shotgun while he covering protests in Las Mercedes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Impactantes imágenes: la agresión al reportero de ''La Patilla'', captada por las cámaras de NTN24|url=http://www.ntn24.com/videos/impactantes-imagenes-la-agresion-al-reportero-de-la-patilla-captada-por-las-camaras-de-ntn24-132099|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=NTN24|date=12 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513213713/http://www.ntn24.com/videos/impactantes-imagenes-la-agresion-al-reportero-de-la-patilla-captada-por-las-camaras-de-ntn24-132099|archive-date=13 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Reportero gráfico de ''La Patilla'' es empujado y golpeado por un PNB: le rompieron el casco de un "cachazo"|url=http://www.ntn24.com/noticias/reportero-grafico-de-la-patilla-es-empujado-y-golpeado-por-un-pnb-le-rompieron-el-casco-de-un-132064|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=NTN24|date=12 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=PNB agrede a reportero gráfico de @La_Patilla (Video)|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/05/12/pnb-agrede-a-reportero-grafico-de-lapatilla-video/|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=La Patilla|date=12 May 2014}}</ref> A week later on 20 May 2014, the same ''La Patilla'' photojournalist  was assaulted by the National Police who tried to take his camera while covering protests in the Las Minitas neighborhood in [[Baruta]].<ref>{{cite news|title=PNB agrede nuevamente a reportero de @La_Patilla en Las Minitas (Video)|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/05/19/pnb-agrede-nuevamente-a-reportero-de-la_patilla-en-las-minitas-video/|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=La Patilla|date=19 May 2014}}</ref> On 27 May 2014, a reporter for ''La Patilla'' was shot in the arm by a National Guardsman while covering clashes in Táchira.<ref>{{cite news|title=Herido por perdigones reportero gráfico de @La_Patilla en Táchira (Fotos)|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/05/27/herido-por-perdigones-reportero-grafico-de-la_patilla-en-tachira-fotos/|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=La Patilla|date=27 May 2014}}</ref> In April 2017, a ''La Patilla'' reporter was shot in the leg at close range with a tear gas canister, fracturing his tibia.<ref>{{cite news|title=El CPJ pide cobertura informativa "segura" durante protestas en Venezuela|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2017/04/12/el-cpj-pide-cobertura-informativa-segura-durante-protestas-en-venezuela/|accessdate=16 April 2017|work=La Patilla|date=12 April 2017|language=es-ES}}</ref>

==Diosdado Cabello==
{{details|Corruption in Venezuela#Diosdado Cabello}}

On 11 August 2015, then President of the National Assembly, [[Diosdado Cabello]], sued ''La Patilla'' and other media organizations for reporting that he was being investigated for his ties to drug trafficking and his alleged role in the [[Cartel of the Suns]]. On 31 May 2017, Bolivarian official [[Pedro Carreño]] leaked a document prior to trial of a decision by Venezuelan courts to award Cabello 1 billion [[Venezuelan bolívar|bolívar]]es ($500,000 USD in May 2017). Cabello stated that with the money, "I am going to pay the lawyers and I will give that to the poor children". The lawyer for ''La Patilla'',  Alejandra Rodríguez, stated that "to publish the contents of a judicial act in the middle of a controversy, of which Pedro Carreño is not a party, invalidates the judicial proceedings ... If that decision is true, it would demonstrate once again that in Venezuela there is no separation of powers and that the Judiciary is an appendage of the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=AFP: Portal venezolano de noticias LaPatilla debe pagar casi US$ 500.000 a líder chavista Diosdado|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2017/06/01/afp-portal-venezolano-de-noticias-lapatilla-debe-pagar-casi-us-500-000-a-lider-chavista-diosdado/|accessdate=1 June 2017|work=La Patilla|date=31 May 2017|language=es-ES}}</ref>

In June 2019, ''La Patilla'' was charged and fined 30 billion sovereign bolivars (about $5 million) after publishing an [[ABC (newspaper)|Diario ABC]] article<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/internacional/20150127/abci-venezuela-cabello-eeuu-201501262129.html|title=El jefe de seguridad del número dos chavista deserta a EE.UU. y le acusa de narcotráfico|last=Blasco|first=Emil J.|date=26 January 2015|website=ABC|language=es|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> that mentioned the president of the pro-Maduro [[2017 Constituent National Assembly]], [[Diosdado Cabello]], in relation to drug trafficking in Venezuela. ''La Patilla'' 's director Ravell, supporter of [[Juan Guaidó]] during [[2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis|the presidential crisis]], wrote that Cabello was engaging in "judicial terrorism". Cabello stated that he would take control of the website if it was unable to pay the fine.<ref name=lapatilla30bn>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/venezuela-news-ordered-pay-5-million-key-regime-081209706.html|title=Venezuela news site ordered to pay $5 million to key regime figure|date=5 June 2019|website=Yahoo News|access-date=5 June 2019}}</ref> Cabello had previously tried to raise judicial processes against ABC and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' for accusations of drug trafficking, but the cases were rejected.<ref name=lapatilla30bn /> Nathalie Southwick (CPJ) said that the measure taken against ''La Patilla'' was an "attempt to bankrupt and shut down a critical outlet" and provided an "example of how the Venezuelan judicial system is being used to retaliate against critical media".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpj.org/2019/06/venezuelas-supreme-court-orders-la-patilla-to-pay-.php|title=Venezuela's Supreme Court orders La Patilla to pay US$5m in damages to Cabello|date=7 June 2019|website=CPJ|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>
