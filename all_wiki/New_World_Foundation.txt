In its [[mission statement]], the New World Foundation stated as of 2009:
<blockquote>
We see the strengths of progressive ideals and committed activists, who every day are inventing democracy and extending its boundaries.  But we also know the strength of reaction, inaction, and injustice in blocking democracyâ€™s advance.  Our work and our tradition is to tip the balance, to add resources to the side of justice, to widen the channels for participation, and to ensure that another generation will see by example how they can make a difference.<ref name="nwf">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105195258/http://www.newwf.org/who_we_are/main.html|archive-date=2009-01-05|title=Who We Are|publisher=New World Foundation|url=http://www.newwf.org/who_we_are/main.html|access-date=2016-08-06|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>
