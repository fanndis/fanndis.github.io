==Personal life==
[[File:Obama Hasina UNGA.jpg|300px|thumb|Sajeeb Wazed, seen third from left, with President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in New York, September 2013]]
Wazed was born in [[Dhaka]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] on 27 July 1971. His parents were nuclear scientist Dr. [[M. A. Wazed Miah]] and [[Sheikh Hasina Wazed]]. In August 1975, his grandparents and uncles were [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|assassinated]] during a military coup in Bangladesh; he and his mother, father and aunt survived as they were visiting [[West Germany]].{{cn|date=February 2020}} The family was barred by the military regime from entering the country until 1981. After returning to Bangladesh in 1981, his mother assumed the presidency of the Awami League and spearheaded the campaign for the restoration of democracy, along with her arch-rival [[Khaleda Zia]]. Wazed attended boarding school in [[India]], including [[St Joseph's College, Nainital|St. Joseph's College]] in [[Nainital]] and [[Kodaikanal International School]] in [[Palani Hills]], Tamil Nadu.{{cn|date=February 2020}} He studied computer science at the [[Bangalore University|University of Bangalore]]; then transferred to [[The University of Texas at Arlington]] in the United States, where he graduated with a BSc in [[computer engineering]]. Subsequently, Wazed attended the [[Kennedy School of Government]] in [[Harvard University]], where he completed his [[Masters in Public Administration]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-the-time-delhi-gave-shelter-to-sheikh-hasina-2384549|title=The time Delhi gave shelter to Sheikh Hasina|date=2017-04-07|website=dna|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>

Wazed was settled in the United States for over two decades. He married Kristine Ann Overmire on October 26, 2002. They have a daughter named Sophia. Their house is located in [[Falls Church, Virginia]].<ref>The mystique of PM’s son, "bdnews24.com ", March 19, 2011, http://opinion.bdnews24.com/2011/03/19/the-mystique-of-pm%E2%80%99s-son/</ref> Since 2009, Wazed has divided his time between Bangladesh and the United States.

==Career==
He is the President of the US-based firm Wazed Consulting Inc. Wazed is regarded as the mastermind of the [[Digital Bangladesh]] initiative and promoting the [[Vision 2021]] manifesto of the Awami League. Wazed was listed by the [[World Economic Forum]] as one of its [[Young Global Leader]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2007/01/19/d70119061775.htm|title=The Daily Star Web EditionVol. 5 Num 939|publisher=}}</ref> Wazed is also a lobbyist and columnist on behalf of the Bangladeshi government.

Wazed has pledged to transform Bangladesh's IT industry into the country's largest export sector, but critics say he has achieved little towards that end. Wazed has accused the Editor of ''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]'', the country's largest circulated English daily, of [[sedition]]; and a pro-opposition journalist of [[attempted murder]].<ref name="davidbergman">{{cite web|url=http://thewire.in/2016/04/20/exclusive-us-court-dismissed-claim-of-plot-to-injure-bangladesh-pm-son-30447/|title=Exclusive: US Court Dismissed Claim of Plot to Injure Bangladesh PM Son|first=David|last=Bergman|work=The Wire}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36063520|title=Senior Bangladesh editor Shafik Rehman is arrested|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bdnews24.com/politics/2016/02/05/joy-wants-daily-star-editor-detained-tried-for-treason-for-false-stories-against-hasina|title=Joy wants Daily Star editor detained, tried for treason for false stories against Hasina|work=bdnews24.com}}</ref> Wazed has also had conflicts with Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]] and refused to publicly denounce Islamic extremists for the murder of Bangladeshi atheists, in order to avoid alienating the country's conservative clergy, despite professing himself as a secularist.

==Leadership==
In 2007 and 2008, the country underwent another black chapter with an unelected caretaker government usurping power with the backing of the then military establishment. The notorious 'Minus Two' formula was put in place not only to rid the former Prime Minister [[Khaleda Zia]], but also Sajeeb Wazed's mother, the then Leader of the Opposition [[Sheikh Hasina]]. After Sheikh Hasina was arrested on non-existent charges which was subsequently found to be unsubstantiated, Sajeeb Wazed took charge of bringing the world's attention not only to the plight of his mother Sheikh Hasina, but also the restoration of democracy in his motherland by launching several campaigns in United States and Europe.

His efforts brought fruition, and the military backed extra constitutional government was compelled to release Sheikh Hasina from prison, following which she has led two consecutive governments having won the national elections in 2008 and 2014 respectively.

His formal involvement in the party made its way on 25 February 2010 as he became a primary member of the Rangpur (the ancestral home district of his late father) district unit of Awami League.<ref>[http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/print_news.php?nid=127938 The Daily Star]</ref> In addition, he joined as a voluntary and unpaid advisor to the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, looking after the country's ICT present and future, a role which he continues till date. Using his mother's position and his own personal reputation among party leaders, he could easily have opted for a top position in the party. However, his humility, willing to learn from the bottom and leadership traits did not allow him to do that.

==Public life==
Wazed first appeared on the Bangladeshi political scene in 2004, when he made a widely publicized visit to Bangladesh. On 25 February 2009, Wazed officially joined the [[Awami League]] as a primary member of the [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]] district unit of the party. Rangpur is the ancestral home district of his father Wazed Miah and his potential parliamentary constituency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/print_news.php?nid=127938nid=127938|title=Joy joins politics|work=The Daily Star}}</ref>

After the Awami League returned to power in 2009 with Sheikh Hasina as Prime Minister for a second time, he made his first public statements after the [[BDR Mutiny]], praising his mother's handling of the crisis. "This is probably the biggest incident Bangladesh has had since 1975 and our government and the prime minister has handled this compassionately, pragmatically but decisively to bring the situation under control" he said in an interview to the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7916158.stm|title=BBC NEWS - South Asia - Bangladesh army backs government|publisher=}}</ref>

Wazed has been active in promoting the [[Digital Bangladesh]] scheme of the Government of Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=128470|title=Telecoms plan unveiled|work=The Daily Star}}</ref>

==Business==
According to [[Fairfax County]] public records, Wazed is the president of Wazed Consulting Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opinion.bdnews24.com/2011/03/19/the-mystique-of-pm%E2%80%99s-son/|title=The mystique of PM’s son|work=The Opinion Pages}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Corruption allegations===
In April 2016, an exclusive write-up by [[David Bergman (journalist)|David Bergman]] in the Indian website ''The Wire'' revealed that a "Suspicious Activity Report" (SAR) covering a transaction of US$300 million recorded in a memo of the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) was linked to Wazed. But the court documents did not provide any further information about the reference to ‘US$300 million’.<ref name="davidbergman"/>

===Muhammad Yunus===
In 2011, Wazed talk about Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]] for his leadership of [[Grameen Bank]], claiming high levels of "fraud and impropriety" in the use of Norwegian government funds at the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-177004|title=Joy's 'letter' tells it all|work=The Daily Star}}</ref> He claims, The government of Norway raised this as a major concern and as a compromise US$30 million was returned. The remaining approximately US$70 million was never returned. All correspondence in this regard was from Yunus himself. A spokesman for the foreign ministry in Oslo said about this issue, it was agreed in 1998 that the bank should return money wrongly transferred from the Grameen Bank to Grameen Kalyan - another part of more than 30 companies headed by Muhammad Yunus that make up the Grameen group of companies.<ref>[http://www.ebangladesh.com/2970   eBangladesh]</ref> The government of Norway had been thoroughly investigated and that it considered it to be closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11947902|title=Grameen: Norway gives all-clear to Bangladesh bank|work=BBC News}}</ref>

===Comments on attacks on atheists===
In 2015, Wazed defended the Awami League government's refusal to publicly condemn the [[Attacks on secularists in Bangladesh|murder of bloggers and publishers]] by Islamic extremists. He opined that the government was walking a fine line to avoid alienating the country's deeply conservative clergy.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/32703432/not-believing-in-god-is-dangerous-for-bloggers-in-bangladesh|title=Not believing in God is dangerous for bloggers in Bangladesh|publisher=}}</ref> His comments were described by [[Nick Cohen]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "pathetic";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/04/islamism-prevails-we-suppress-free-speech-bangladeshi-blogger|title=Islamism prevails even as we suppress free speech|first=Nick|last=Cohen|work=the Guardian}}</ref> while Trisha Ahmed, the stepdaughter of slain [[Avijit Roy]], responded that "Bangladesh is powerless; it's corrupt, there is no law and order, and I highly doubt that any justice will come to the murderers."<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

===Conflict with editors===
In 2016, Wazed accused [[Mahfuz Anam]], editor and publisher of ''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]'', of treason and demanded his imprisonment for publishing reports in 2007 on the basis of intelligence sources, accusing his mother Sheikh Hasina of corruption. The [[BBC]] has reported that the Bangladeshi government has been seeking to curtail the finances of the influential newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35594968|title='Attempt to crush independent media' in Bangladesh|work=BBC News}}</ref> later on Mahfuz Anam has admitted to his 'biggest mistake' in journalism, saying it was wrong of him to run corruption stories against Sheikh Hasina during the 2007-8 military-controlled caretaker regime.<ref>[http://bdnews24.com/media-en/2016/02/04/daily-star-editor-mahfuz-anam-admits-to-publishing-dgfi-fed-baseless-stories|title='Daily Star Editor Mahfuz Anam admits to publishing DGFI-fed baseless stories|work=bdnews24.com]</ref>
