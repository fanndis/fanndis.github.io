==History==
Prior to the 1880s, the New Zealand made few changes to the criminal law it had inherited from England in 1840, aside from adopting the 1861 English reforms in 1867. One recommendation from the commissioners that consolidated the New Zealand statutes, prior to enactment of the Statutes Revision Act 1879 that allowed for their reprinting, was that the criminal law should be codified in a way that suited New Zealand conditions, rather than merely adopting similar legislative changes being debated in 1880 by the English Parliament. A Criminal Code bill was first drafted in 1883 and introduced into the House of Representatives in June that year.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Joint Statutes Revision Committee |title=Statutes Revision Commission: Report on the Criminal Code |url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_bill/ccb188431125.pdf |website=nzlii.org |accessdate=25 January 2020 |date=7 August 1883}}</ref> However, over the next 10 years the bill's passage through the Parliament failed to achieve majority support at various stages, despite repeated introductions and initial support. The bill was finally passed at the end of September 1893 and the Criminal Code Act 1893 received royal assent on 6 October 1893.<ref name="Codification of Criminal Law" />

Enactment of the Consolidated Statutes Enactment Act 1908 on 4 August 1908 resulted in the Criminal Code Act 1893 being consolidated into the Crimes Act 1908. The 1908 Act was further consolidated and amended with the passage of the Crimes Act 1961 on 1 November 1961.<ref name="Schedule 5 NZ enactments repealed" />

===Amendments===
The Crimes Act has been substantially amended since 1961:

====Punishment (Part 2)====
Section 14 of the Crimes Act 1961 allowed [[capital punishment in New Zealand|death sentences]]. However, due to growing general public opposition to the death penalty, reformist [[New Zealand National Party]] Minister of Justice [[Ralph Hanan]] and other National MPs exercised a [[conscience vote]] and voted with the abolitionist [[New Zealand Labour Party]] to forbid judges passing sentence of death other than in cases of treason.<ref>{{cite web |title=Capital punishment in New Zealand |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/the-death-penalty |website=NZHistory.govt.nz |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=9 April 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408050433/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/the-death-penalty |archivedate=8 April 2019 |date=5 August 2014}}</ref> That was the functional abolition in New Zealand, with no one executed after this date. In 1989, the death penalty was formally abolished by the [[Fourth Labour Government]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Abolition of the Death Penalty Act 1989 |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0119/latest/DLM193572.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>

====Matters of justification or excuse (Part 3)====
The [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007]] abolished Section 59 of the Crimes Act, which had previously allowed parental [[corporal punishment]] of children, despite opposition from religious social conservatives and others.<ref>{{cite news |title=Anti-smacking bill becomes law |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10440080 |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=16 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103015045/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10440080 |archivedate=3 November 2017}}</ref>

====Crimes against morality and decency, sexual crimes, and public welfare (Part 7)====
Amendments in 1985 resulted in crime of [[rape]] being replaced with one of [[sexual violation]], a similar offence but without gender specificity. Further changes in 2005 resulted in gender specificity being removed from all criminal sexual offences.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 128: Sexual violation defined |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329051.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>

The Crimes Amendment Act (No 3) 1985 (commenced 1 February 1986) criminalised [[marital rape]] and added the offence of sexual violation by unlawful sexual connection, criminalising female-on-male sexual violation and expanding sexual violation to include anal and oral intercourse.<ref>{{cite web |title=Crimes Amendment Act (No 3) 1985 |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1985/0160/latest/whole.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>

The [[Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986]] amended the Crimes Act, allowing for consensual homosexual relationships between men.<ref>{{cite web |title=Homosexual law reform in New Zealand |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/homosexual-law-reform/homosexual-law-reform |website=NZHistory.govt.nz |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=9 April 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122034344/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/homosexual-law-reform/homosexual-law-reform |archivedate=22 January 2020 |date=14 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=30th anniversary of Homosexual Law Reform Act |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features/30th-anniversary-of-homosexual-law-reform-act/ |publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]] |accessdate=9 April 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708135721/https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features/30th-anniversary-of-homosexual-law-reform-act/ |archivedate=8 July 2016 |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>

In 1995, the Crimes Amendment Act 1995 (No 49) inserted Sections 144A, 144B, and 144C which deal with sexual offenses outside of New Zealand. 
Section 144A of the Crimes Act deals with New Zealand citizens and ordinary residents that commit acts of [[child sexual abuse]] in overseas jurisdictions through [[child sex tourism]]. It applies existing prohibitions against sexual connection and indecent acts with children under twelve and young people to children within overseas jurisdictions. Under Section 144C, it is also illegal to promote child sex tourism overseas from New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web |title=Crimes Amendment Act 1995 (1995 No 49) |url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/caa19951995n49189/ |publisher=New Zealand Legal Information Institute |accessdate=9 April 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511024935/http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/caa19951995n49189/ |archivedate=11 May 2016}}</ref>

In 2003, the [[Prostitution Reform Act 2003]] decriminalised sex work, removing sections 147-149A of the Crimes Act, which had formerly prohibited most forms of [[prostitution in New Zealand]] through maintaining criminal penalties against soliciting, living off the proceeds of sex work, brothel-keeping and managing sex workers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Prostitution Reform Act 2003 |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0028/latest/DLM197815.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Jordan |first1=Jan |title=Sex work - Legislation and decriminalisation |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/sex-work/page-4 |website=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=9 April 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215113513/https://teara.govt.nz/en/sex-work/page-4 |archivedate=15 February 2019 |date=31 May 2018}}</ref>

In 2005, the Crimes Amendment Act 2005 (commenced 20 July 2005) amended the Crimes Act 1961 to make most sexual offences gender-neutral. This closed a legal loophole which prevented adult females from being convicted of sexual offending against boys under 16.<ref>{{cite web |title=Crimes Amendment Act 2005 |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2005/0041/latest/whole.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>

In March 2019, Parliament unanimously passed the Crimes Amendment Bill abolishing Section 123, which dealt with the offense of [[blasphemy]], in accordance with modern [[religious pluralism]] and [[free speech]] sensibilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/combined/HansDeb_20190305_20190305_32 |title=Crimes Amendment Bill — Third Reading |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Ensor |first1=Jamie |title='Archaic' blasphemous libel law repealed in Parliament |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/03/archaic-blasphemous-libel-law-repealed-in-parliament.html |accessdate=9 April 2020|publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=6 March 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306040652/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/03/archaic-blasphemous-libel-law-repealed-in-parliament.html |archivedate=6 March 2019}}</ref>

====Crimes against the person (Part 8)====
In 1987, Section 187A of the Crimes Act was inserted, permitting [[abortion]] on the grounds of saving the mother's life, mental health, and physical health; foetal abnormality within the 20 weeks gestation period; and incest or sexual intercourse with guardians and family members.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 187 of Crimes Act 1961 |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329364.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=26 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200121123841/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329364.html|archive-date=21 January 2020}}</ref>

In January 1996, the Crimes Amendment Act 1995 inserted Section 20A, which outlaws [[female genital mutilation]] within New Zealand, and Section 204B, which deals with ancillary and related offences.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 204A: Female genital mutilation |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329734.html |website=New Zealand Legislation|publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Section 204B: Further offences relating to female genital mutilation |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329750.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>

In 2002, the Sentencing Act 2002 changed the penalty for murder from mandatory life imprisonment to presumptive life imprisonment; sentencing judges now may waive the mandatory life imprisonment requirement and give a lesser sentence in exceptional ("manifestly unjust") circumstances.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 102: Presumption in favour of life imprisonment for murder |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0009/latest/DLM136495.html?search=sw_096be8ed818a57f3_murder_25_se&p=1&sr=6 |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>

In 2018, the Family Violence (Amendments) Act 2018 inserted new offenses relating to strangulation or suffocation (Section 189A), assault on person in a family relationship (Section 194A), coerced marriages or civil unions (Section 207A), and abductions for the purposes of marriage or civil union or sexual connection (Section 208).<ref>{{cite web |title=Family Violence (Amendments) Act 2018 |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2018/0047/latest/LMS113435.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>

In March 2020, the [[Abortion Legislation Act 2020]] replaced Sections 182A to 187A with Section 183, which states that abortion is only an offense if a person who is not a health practitioner procures or performs an abortion on a woman. The woman is not guilty of the offense.<ref name="Sections 182-187">{{cite web |title=Sections 182A to 187A replaced |url=http://legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2019/0164/latest/LMS237615.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>

[[Euthanasia in New Zealand]] is currently illegal under Sections 160 (culpable homicide), 173 (attempting to murder) and 179 (aiding and abetting suicide). Four attempts have been made to decriminalise assisted suicide through parliamentary bills in 1995, 2003, 2012, and 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Assisted dying: New Zealand |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/library-research-papers/research-papers/assisted-dying-new-zealand/ |publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]] |accessdate=9 April 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407101603/https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/library-research-papers/research-papers/assisted-dying-new-zealand/ |archivedate=7 April 2020 |date=20 December 2018}}</ref> In November 2019, [[David Seymour (New Zealand politician)|David Seymour]]'s [[End of Life Choice Bill]] passed its third reading.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/beehive-live/117384206/mps-vote-on-final-reading-of-end-of-life-choice-bill|title=MPs vote in favour of End of Life Choice Bill at final reading|work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|first=Henry|last=Cooke|date=13 November 2019|access-date=13 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113155110/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/beehive-live/117384206/mps-vote-on-final-reading-of-end-of-life-choice-bill|archive-date=13 November 2019}}</ref> A [[2020 New Zealand euthanasia referendum|binding referendum]] will be held during the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 general election]] in September 2020 to pass the End of Life Choice Bill into law.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/13/new-zealand-to-vote-in-referendum-on-euthanasia-cannabis|title=New Zealand to vote in referendum on euthanasia|first=Charlotte|last=Graham-McLay|date=13 November 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=14 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223082049/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/13/new-zealand-to-vote-in-referendum-on-euthanasia-cannabis|archive-date=23 December 2019}}</ref>

====Crimes against property (Part 10)====
Part 10 of the act, ''Crimes against the right of property'', was totally rewritten in 2003. In doing so, the definition of [[Burglary]] was revised and simplified to only require entry to be unauthorised rather than also requiring an act of breaking.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 231: Burglary |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM330242.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>

In 2019, the Crimes Amendment Act 2019 (No 4) introduced the concept of ''Burglary of agricultural land'' along with increasing penalties for ''Theft of animals'', in response to increasing reports of stock rustling as well as nighttime hunting, slaughtering and butchering of farm animals in roadside fields.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 231A: Entry onto agricultural land with intent to commit imprisonable offence |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/LMS170472.html |website=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>
