{{Republicanism sidebar}}
'''Republicanism in the United Kingdom''' is the political movement that seeks to replace the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]] with a [[republic]]. For those who want a non-hereditary head of state, the method by which one should be chosen is not agreed upon, with some favouring an elected president, some an appointed head of state with little power. Others support something akin to the Swiss model, with a [[Directorial system|directorate]] functioning as a collective head of state.

[[Monarchy]] has been the [[form of government]] used in the countries that now make up the United Kingdom since the [[Middle Ages]]. However, a republican government existed in England and Wales, later along with Ireland and Scotland, in the mid-17th century as a result of the Parliamentarian victory in the [[English Civil War]]. The [[Commonwealth of England]], as the period was called, lasted from the [[execution of Charles I]] in 1649 until [[the Restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660.

The main lobby group that campaigns for the abolition of the monarchy is [[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]].

==Context==
Within Britain, republican sentiment has largely focused on the abolition of the British monarch, rather than the dissolution of the [[British unionism|British Union]] or independence for its [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]].

In [[Northern Ireland]], the term "republican" is usually used in the sense of [[Irish republicanism]]. While also against monarchical forms of government, Irish republicans are against the presence of the British state in ''any'' form in [[Ireland]] and advocate creating a [[united Ireland]], an all-island state comprising the whole of Ireland. [[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionists]] who support a British republic [[Politics of Northern Ireland#Voting patterns|also exist]] in Northern Ireland.

There are republican members of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) in [[Scotland]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] in [[Wales]] who advocate independence for those countries as republics. The SNP's official policy is that the British monarch would remain head of state of an independent Scotland, unless the people of Scotland decided otherwise.<ref name="Salmond">{{cite news|url=http://www.snp.org/speech/2012/jan/scotlands-place-world |publisher=Scottish National Party |title=Scotland's place in the world |author=Alex Salmond |date=January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801021331/http://www.snp.org/speech/2012/jan/scotlands-place-world |archive-date=1 August 2013 }}</ref> Plaid Cymru have a similar view for Wales, although its youth wing, [[Plaid Ifanc]], has an official policy advocating a Welsh republic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The [[Scottish Socialist Party]] and the [[Scottish Greens]] both support an independent Scottish republic.

==History==
Since the 1970s, early modern English republicanism has been extensively studied by historians, to the point where [[monarchism]] and [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]] have now become neglected fields. [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] (1611–1677) is generally considered to be the most representative republican writer of the era.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Wiemann |first1=Dirk |last2=Mahlberg |first2=Gaby (ed.) |date=2016 |title=Perspectives on English Revolutionary Republicanism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17YoDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1 |location=Abingdon-on-Thames |publisher=Routledge |page=1 |isbn=978-1-317-08176-0 |access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref>

===Cromwellian Commonwealth===
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}
{{Main|Commonwealth of England|The Protectorate|Interregnum (England)}}{{See also|Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}
The [[Countries of the United Kingdom|countries]] that now make up the United Kingdom, together with the present [[Republic of Ireland]], were briefly ruled as a republic in the 17th century, first under the Commonwealth consisting of the [[Rump Parliament]] and the [[English Council of State|Council of State]] (1649–1653) and then under the [[Protectorate (English history)|Protectorate]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and later his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] (1653–1659), and finally under the restored Rump Parliament (1659-60). The Commonwealth Parliament represented itself as a Republic on the classical model, with [[John Milton]] writing an [[The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates|early defense of republicanism]] in the idiom of constitutional limits on a monarch's power.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Cromwell's Protectorate was less ideologically republican and was seen by Cromwell as restoring the mixed constitution of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy found in classical literature and English common law discourse.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

First the [[Kingdom of England]] was declared to be the [[Commonwealth of England]] and then Scotland and Ireland were briefly forced into union with England by the army. This decision was later reversed when the monarchy was restored in 1660. In 1707 the Act of Union between England and Scotland was signed; the two countries' parliaments became one, and in return Scotland was granted access to the [[English overseas possessions]].

[[File:Cromwell as a usurper.tiff|thumb|upright|A Dutch satirical view of Cromwell as a usurper of monarchical power]]
Many of Cromwell's actions upon gaining power were decried as "harsh, unwise, and tyrannical".{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} He and General [[Thomas Fairfax]] were often ruthless in putting down the mutinies which occurred within their own army towards the end of the civil wars (prompted by Parliament's failure to pay the troops). They showed little sympathy for the [[Levellers]], an [[egalitarian]] movement which had contributed greatly{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} to Parliament's cause but sought representation for ordinary citizens. The Leveller point of view had been strongly represented in the [[Putney Debates]], held between the various factions of the Army in 1647, just prior to the King's temporary escape from army custody. Cromwell and the [[Grandees]] were not prepared to permit such a radical democracy and used the debates to play for time while the future of the King was being determined. [[Catholicism|Catholics]] were persecuted zealously under Cromwell. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Although he personally was in favour of religious toleration – "liberty for tender consciences" – not all his compatriots agreed. The war led to much [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|death and chaos in Ireland]] where Irish Catholics and Protestants who fought for the Royalists were persecuted. There was a ban on many forms of entertainment, as public meetings could be used as a cover for conspirators; horse racing was banned, the [[maypole]]s were famously cut down, the theatres were closed, and Christmas celebrations were outlawed for being too ceremonial, Catholic, and "popish".

Much of Cromwell's power was due to the Rump Parliament, a Parliament purged of opposition to grandees in the [[New Model Army]]. Whereas [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had been in part restrained by a Parliament that would not always do as he wished (the cause of the Civil War), Cromwell was able to wield much more power as only loyalists were allowed to become [[Members of Parliament|MPs]], turning the chamber into a rubber-stamping organisation. This was ironic given his complaints about Charles I acting without heeding the "wishes" of the people. But even so he found it almost impossible to get his Parliaments to follow all his wishes. His executive decisions were often thwarted – most famously in the ending of the rule of the regional major generals appointed by himself.

In 1657 Cromwell was offered the crown by Parliament, presenting him with a dilemma since he had played a great role in abolishing the monarchy. After two months of deliberation, he rejected the offer. Instead, he was ceremonially re-installed as "[[Lord Protector]] of England, Scotland and Ireland" (Wales was a part of England), with greater powers than he had previously held. It is often suggested that offering Cromwell the Crown was an effort to curb his power: as a King he would be obliged to honour agreements such as [[Magna Carta]], but under the arrangement he had designed he had no such restraints. This allowed him to preserve and enhance his power and the army's while decreasing Parliament's control over him, probably to enable him to maintain a well-funded army which Parliament could not be depended upon to provide.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The office of Lord Protector was not formally hereditary, although Cromwell was able to nominate his own successor in his son, [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]].

===Restoration of the monarchy===
Although England, Scotland and Ireland became [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], after the reigns of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his brother [[James II of England|James II and VII]], and with the ascension of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] to the English, Irish and Scottish thrones as a result of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, there have been movements throughout the last few centuries whose aims were to remove the monarchy and establish a republican system. A notable period was the time in the late 18th century and early 19th century when many [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] such as the minister [[Joseph Fawcett]] were openly republican.<ref>White, Daniel E. (2006). ''Early Romanticism and religious dissent''. Cambridge University Press, p. 93 {{ISBN|978-0-521-85895-3}}</ref>

=== American and French Revolutions ===
[[File:Thomas Paine rev1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Paine]] (1737–1809): "One of the strongest natural proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings is that nature disproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule, by giving mankind ''an ass for a lion''."<ref name="Foner" />]]
The [[American Revolution]] had a great impact on political thought in the British Isles. According to [[Christopher Hitchens]], the British–American author, philosopher, politician and activist, [[Thomas Paine]] was the "moral author of the American Revolution", who posited in the soon widely read pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (January 1776) that the conflict of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] with the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian monarchy]] in London was best resolved by setting up a separate [[democratic republic]].<ref name="NPR">{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2007/10/23/15328527/hitchens-how-paines-rights-changed-the-world |title=Hitchens: How Paine's 'Rights' Changed the World |author=Christopher Hitchens |work=NPR Books |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=23 October 2007 |access-date=23 May 2016}}</ref> To him, republicanism was more important than independence.

{{Main|Revolution Controversy}}
When the [[French Revolution]] broke out in 1789, debates started in the British Isles on how to respond. Soon a pro-Revolutionary republican and anti-Revolutionary monarchist camp had established themselves amongst the intelligentsia, who waged a pamphlet war until 1795. Prominent figures of the republican camp were [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[William Godwin]] and again Thomas Paine.<ref>{{aut|Butler, Marilyn}}, ed. ''Burke, Paine, Godwin, and the Revolution Controversy'' (1984), p. 1.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-28656-5}}.</ref>

Paine would also play an important role inside the Revolution in France as an elected member of the [[National Convention]] (1792–93), where he lobbied for the [[invasion of Britain]] to establish a republic after the example of the United States, [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|France]] and its [[Sister Republic]]s, but also famously opposed the [[execution of Louis XVI]], which got him arrested.<ref name="NPR" /> The [[First French Republic]] would indeed stage an [[Expédition d'Irlande|Expedition to Ireland]] in December 1796 to help the [[Society of United Irishmen]] set up an Irish republic in order to destabilise the United Kingdom, but this ended in a failure. The subsequent [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] was utterly crushed by the British Army. [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|Napoleon also planned an invasion of Britain]] since 1798 and more seriously since 1803, but in 1804 he relinquished republicanism by [[Coronation of Napoleon I|crowning himself Emperor of the French]] and converting all Sister Republics into client kingdoms of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], before calling off the invasion of Britain altogether in 1805.

=== Revolutionary republicanism, 1800–1848 ===
[[File:Flag of the British Republic.svg|thumb|British republican flag, originated in 1816, in use until at least 1935.<ref name="Riot City">{{Cite book |last=Bloom |first=Clive |date=2012 |title=Riot City |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fr59Hr4FDDcC&pg=PA156 |location=London |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |pages=156–158 |isbn=978-1-137-02937-9 |access-date=2 March 2016}}</ref>]]
From the start of the French Revolution into the early 19th century, the revolutionary [[Flag of France|blue-white-red tricolour]] was used throughout England, Wales and Ireland in defiance of the royal establishment. During the 1816 [[Spa Fields riots]], a green, white and red horizontal flag appeared for the first time, soon followed by a red, white and green horizontal version allegedly in use during the 1817 [[Pentrich rising]] and the 1819 [[Peterloo Massacre]]. The latter is now associated with [[Flag of Hungary|Hungary]], but then it became known as the [[British Republican Flag]]. It may have been inspired by the French revolutionary tricolour, but this is unclear. It was however often accompanied by [[Hendiatris|slogans consisting of three words]] such as "Fraternity – Liberty – Humanity" (a clear reference to ''[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]''), and adopted by the [[Chartism|Chartist movement]] in the 1830s.<ref name="Riot City" />

Besides these skirmishes in Great Britain itself, separatist republican revolutions against the British monarchy during the [[Rebellions of 1837|Canadian rebellions of 1837–38]] and the [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848]] failed.

Parliament passed the [[Treason Felony Act 1848|Treason Felony Act]] in 1848. This act made advocacy of republicanism punishable by [[penal transportation|transportation]] to Australia, which was later amended to life imprisonment. The law is still on the statute books; however in a 2003 case, the [[Law Lords]] stated that "It is plain as a pike staff to the respondents and everyone else that no one who advocates the peaceful abolition of the monarchy and its replacement by a republican form of government is at any risk of prosecution", for the reason that the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] would require the 1848 Act to be interpreted in such a way as to render such conduct non-criminal.<ref name="LawLords">{{cite web|last1=House of Lords|title=Regina v Her Majesty's Attorney General (Appellant) ex parte Rusbridger and another (Respondents)|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldjudgmt/jd030626/rus-2.htm|website=House of Lords|access-date=11 January 2015}}</ref>

=== Late 19th century ===
During the later years of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign, there was considerable criticism of her decision to withdraw from public life following the death of her husband, [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]]. This resulted in a "significant incarnation" of republicanism.<ref name="Olech190">Andrzej Olechnowicz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WNI_cx0J5qIC&pg=PA190 The Monarchy and the British Nation, 1780 to the Present]. Cambridge University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-521-84461-4}}, (p. 190).</ref> During the 1870s, calls for Britain to become a republic on the American or French model were made by the politicians [[Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet|Charles Dilke]]<ref>Thomas M. Costa, "Dilke, Charles Wentworth" in Historical Dictionary of the British Empire edited by James S. Olson and Robert Shadle. Greenwood Press, 1996 {{ISBN|0-313-27917-9}}</ref> and [[Charles Bradlaugh]], as well as journalist [[George W. M. Reynolds]].<ref name="Olech190" /> This republican presence continued in debates and the Labour press, especially in the event of royal weddings, jubilees and births, until well into the [[Interwar Period]].<ref name="Olech190" />

Some members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], such as [[Keir Hardie]] (1856–1915), also held republican views.<ref>Reid, Fred. (1978) ''Keir Hardie: the making of a socialist''. Croom Helm, p. 96. {{ISBN|978-0-85664-624-9}}.</ref>

=== 20th-century republicanism ===
In 1923, at the Labour Party's annual conference, two motions were proposed, supported by [[Ernest Thurtle]] and [[Emrys Hughes]]. The first was "that the Royal Family is no longer a necessary party of the British constitution", and the second was "that the hereditary principle in the British Constitution be abolished".<ref name="km">[[Kingsley Martin]],'' The Crown and the Establishment''. London, Hutchinson. 1962  (pp. 53–54)</ref> [[George Lansbury]] responded that, although he too was a republican, he regarded the issue of the monarchy as a "distraction" from more important issues. Lansbury added that he believed the "social revolution" would eventually remove the monarchy peacefully in the future. Both of the motions were overwhelmingly defeated.<ref name="km" /><ref>[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], ''[[Speak for Britain!: A New History of the Labour Party]]''.

Maxton argued that while the monarchy had benefited Britain in the past, it had now "outlived its usefulness". Five MPs voted to support the bill, including [[Alfred Salter]]. However the bill was defeated by 403 votes.<ref>Denis Judd, ''George VI''.

[[File:Tony Benn2.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Tony Benn]] in 2007.]]

In 1991, Labour MP [[Tony Benn]] introduced the [[Commonwealth of Britain Bill]], which called for the transformation of the United Kingdom into a "democratic, federal and secular Commonwealth of Britain", with an elected President.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.uk/edm/1995-96/1075 |title=Early day motion 1075|work=UK Parliament}}</ref> The monarchy would be abolished and replaced by a republic with a written constitution.

In January 1997, [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] broadcast a live television debate ''Monarchy: The Nation Decides'', in which 2.5 million viewers voted on the question "Do you want a monarch?" by telephone. Speaking for the republican view were Professor [[Stephen Haseler]], (chairman of Republic), [[agony aunt]] [[Claire Rayner]], [[Paul Flynn (politician)|Paul Flynn]], Labour MP for Newport West and [[Andrew Neil]], then the former editor of ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. Those in favour of the monarchy included author [[Frederick Forsyth]], [[Bernie Grant]], Labour MP for Tottenham, and [[Jeffrey Archer]], former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party. Conservative MP [[Steven Norris]] was scheduled to appear in a discussion towards the end of the programme, but officials from [[Carlton Television]] said he had left without explanation. The debate was conducted in front of an audience of 3,000 at the [[National Exhibition Centre]] in [[Birmingham]], with the telephone poll result being that 66% of voters wanted a monarch, and 34% did not.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/66-yes-vote-to-monarchy-in-tv-phone-poll-contradicts-previous-result-1.19905|title= 66% 'yes' vote to monarchy in TV 'phone poll contradicts previous result|work=[[The Irish Times]]|last=Borrill|first=Rachel|date=8 January 1997|access-date=17 February 2019}}</ref>

=== 21st-century republicanism ===
[[MORI]] polls in the opening years of the 21st century showed support for retaining the monarchy stable at around 70% of people, but in 2005, at the time of the [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles|wedding]] of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Camilla Parker Bowles]], support for the monarchy dipped, with one poll showing that 65% of people would support keeping the monarchy if there were a referendum on the issue, with 22% saying they favoured a republic.<ref name="ipsos-mori.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/122/MonarchyRoyal-Family-Trends-Monarchy-v-Republic-19932013.aspx?view=wide|title=Monarchy/Royal Family Trends – Monarchy v Republic 1993-2013|date=19 July 2013|work=ipsos-mori.com|access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref> In 2009 an [[ICM (polling)|ICM]] poll, commissioned by the [[BBC]], found that 76% of those asked wanted the monarchy to continue after the Queen, against 18% of people who said they would favour Britain becoming a republic and 6% who said they did not know.<ref>{{Cite news|title=PM and Palace 'discussed reform' |work=BBC News |date=29 March 2009 |access-date=29 March 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7967142.stm}}</ref>

===Lobby groups===
{{Main|Republic (political organisation)}}
The largest lobby group in favour of republicanism in the United Kingdom is the [[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]] campaign group, founded in 1983. The group has benefited from occasional negative publicity about the Royal Family, and Republic reported a large rise in membership following the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles. Republic has lobbied on changes to the parliamentary oath of allegiance, royal finances and changes to the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] relating to the monarchy, none of which have produced any change. However, Republic has been invited to Parliament to talk as witnesses on certain issues related to the monarchy such as conduct of the [[honours system in the United Kingdom]].

In 2009 Republic made news<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/aug/20/prince-charles-architecture-foundation-charity-commission|title=Prince Charles's architecture foundation could face investigation|author=Robert Booth|date=20 August 2009|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref> by reporting Prince Charles's architecture charity to the Charity Commission, claiming that the Prince was effectively using the organisation as a private lobbying firm (the Commission declined to take the matter further). Republic has previously broken stories about royals using the Freedom of Information Act.  The organisation is regularly called up to comment and provide quotes for the press, national and local radio and national TV programmes, with much criticism as to the portrayal of the monarchy by the BBC which has been accused of celebrating the monarchy rather than keeping its politically neutral stance on issues related to it.

[[Labour for a Republic]] is the Labour Party's campaign for an elected head of state, and acts as a pressure group made up of members and supporters of the party. It advocates abolition of the monarchy in favour of a democratic republic.<ref name="lfr">{{cite web|url= https://labourforarepublic.org.uk/about/|title=About|website=Labour for a Republic|access-date=12 February 2019|date=18 June 2017}}</ref>

===Media===
''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' and ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' newspapers have all advocated the abolition of the monarchy.<ref name="NewStat">{{cite magazine|last=Katawala|first=Sunder|title=The monarchy is more secure than ever|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2012/02/monarchy-jubilee-media-public|access-date=9 June 2013|magazine=New Statesman|date=7 Feb 2012}}</ref>  In the wake of the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 MPs' expenses scandal]], a poll of readers of the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' newspapers placed support for abolition of the monarchy at 54%, although only 3% saw it as a top priority.<ref name="GuardianPoll">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/03/guardian-observer-political-reform-survey |newspaper=The Guardian|title=Readers give their verdict: first fix the electoral system |date=3 June 2009 |location=London |access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref>

==Arguments in favour of a republic==

===The benefits of a republic===
Republicans suggest that republicanism is a constitutional step which answers a number of key issues.

The [[advocacy group]] [[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]] argues: {{quote|The monarchy is not only an unaccountable and expensive institution, unrepresentative of modern Britain, it also gives politicians almost limitless power.

It does this is in a variety of ways:
*[[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]]: Royal powers that allow the Prime Minister to declare war or sign treaties (amongst other things) without a vote in Parliament.
*The [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]: A body of advisors to the monarch, now mostly made up of senior politicians, which can enact legislation without a vote in Parliament.
*The [[Crown in Parliament|Crown-in-Parliament]]: The principle, which came about when Parliament removed much of the monarch's power, by which Parliament can pass any law it likes – meaning our liberties can never be guaranteed.<ref name="want" />}}

Republicans also want to see a constitution that they claim will inspire aspiration (by allowing anyone to become head of state) and political responsibility (by introducing popular sovereignty, the notion that the people are "in charge"). They also claim that they want what is "best for Britain", which includes the best democracy.<ref name="case">{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/The%20Case%20for%20a%20Republic/index.php|title=The case for a republic|publisher=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]|access-date=1 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517123405/http://www.republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/The%20Case%20for%20a%20Republic/index.php|archive-date=17 May 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Arguments against monarchy===
Republicans assert that hereditary monarchy is unfair and elitist. They claim that in a modern and democratic society no one should be expected to defer to another simply because of their birth. Such a system, they assert, does not make for a society which is at ease with itself, and it encourages attitudes which are more suited to a bygone age of imperialism than to a "modern nation". Some claim that maintaining a privileged royal family diminishes a society and encourages a feeling of dependency in many people who should instead have confidence in themselves and their fellow citizens.<ref name="case" />

Further, republicans argue that "the people", not the members of one family, should be sovereign.<ref name="case" />
;Monarchy contradicts democracy
:;Monarchy denies ''the people'' a basic right: Republicans believe that it should be a fundamental right of the people of any nation to elect their head of state and for every citizen to be eligible to hold that office. It is argued such a head of state is more accountable to the people, and that such accountability to the people creates a better nation.<ref>Hames, Tim; Leonard, Mark (1998). ''Modernising the monarchy.'' Demos. p. 22. {{ISBN|978-1-898309-74-1}}.</ref>
:;Monarchy devalues a parliamentary system: Monarchical prerogative powers can be used to circumvent normal democratic process with no accountability, and such processes are more desirable than not for any given nation-state.<ref name="want">{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/index.php|title=What we want|publisher=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]|access-date=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419194543/http://republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/index.php|archive-date=19 April 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
;A monarchy demands deference
:It is argued by republicans that the way citizens are expected to address members, however junior, of the royal family is part of an attempt to keep subjects "in their place".<ref>Bertram, Christopher (2004). ''Routledge philosophy guidebook to Rousseau and The social contract.'' Routledge. p. 160.</ref>
;It is the enemy of merit and aspiration
:The order of succession in a monarchy specifies a person who will become head of state, regardless of qualifications. The highest titular office in the land is not open to "free and fair competition". Although monarchists argue that the position of Prime Minister, the title with real power, is something anyone can aspire to become, the executive and symbolically powerful position of Head of State is not.
;Monarchy imposes a state religion
:Republicans argue that a monarch who is the head of an [[established church]] in an increasingly secular and multicultural society reinforces the notion of hereditary privilege based on the [[divine right of kings]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} On the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal coat of arms]] is the motto in {{lang-fr|[[Dieu et mon droit]]}} (God and my right). The established church in England is the [[Church of England]] which has the King or Queen of the United Kingdom as its head. The church is [[tax exempt]] and provides the [[House of Lords]] in Parliament with 26 unelected [[bishop]]s as its representatives.
;It devalues intellect and achievement
:Republicans argue that members of the royal family bolster their position with unearned symbols of achievement. Examples in the UK include [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom#Honorary military appointments|the Queen's many honorary military titles]] of colonel-in-chief, regardless of her military experience. There is debate over the roles which the members of the monarchy have played in the military; many doubt that members of the Royal Family have served on the front line on the same basis as other members of the Armed Forces. Examples here include Prince Andrew, whose presence during the [[Falklands War]] was later criticised by the commander of the British Naval Force who stated that "special measures" had to be taken to ensure that the prince did not lose his life,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/falklandislands/9150339/Falkland-Islands-Britain-would-lose-if-Argentina-decides-to-invade-now.html |work=The Telegraph |title=Falkland Islands: Britain 'would lose' if Argentina decides to invade now |date=17 March 2012 |location=London |first=Cole |last=Moreton}}</ref> and Prince Harry, who was moved to a safe room and placed under guard during an attack on the Camp Bastion base in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19631596 |work=BBC News |title=Prince Harry under guard during Taliban attack on base |date=18 September 2012}}</ref> It is seen to some as more of a PR exercise than military service. Members of the royal family are fast-tracked to higher ranks in the army.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-charles/9335960/Prince-Charles-awarded-highest-rank-in-all-three-armed-forces.html |title=Prince Charles awarded highest rank in all three armed forces |date=28 March 2017}}</ref>
;It harms the monarchs themselves
:Republicans argue that a hereditary system condemns each heir to the throne to an abnormal childhood. This was historically the reason why the anarchist [[William Godwin]] opposed the monarchy. [[Johann Hari]] has written a book ''God Save the Queen?'' in which he argues that every member of the royal family has suffered psychologically from the system of monarchy.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.johannhari.com/archive/article.php?id=603|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317043938/http://www.johannhari.com/archive/article.php?id=603|author=Johann Hari|archive-date=17 March 2006|title=God Save the Queen?|chapter=Chapter One|publisher=Icon Books|year=2002|isbn=978-1840464016|via=JohannHari.com}}</ref>
;Monarchs are not impartial, and lack accountability
:Republicans argue that monarchs are not impartial but harbour their own opinions, motives, and wish to protect their interests. Republicans claim that monarchs are not ''accountable''. As an example, republicans argue that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] has spoken and acted in ways that have widely been interpreted as taking a political stance, citing his refusal to attend, in protest of China's dealings with [[Tibet]], a state dinner hosted by the Queen for the Chinese head of state; his strong stance on GM food; and the contents of the [[black spider memos]], which were released following freedom of information litigation, regarding how people achieve their positions.<ref name="charles-tibet">{{cite web|url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/wtnarchive/2002/9/26_5.html |title=Tibet News Network: Charles furore grows with Tibet missive |access-date=1 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928002250/http://www.tibet.ca/en/wtnarchive/2002/9/26_5.html |archive-date=28 September 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2280564.stm Palace defends prince's letters].

[[BBC News]]. 9 February 2000.</ref><p>Republicans see a lack of important democratic accountability and transparency for such institutions.
;The monarchy is expensive
:Republicans argue that it costs a lot to have a monarchy. Republicans claim that the total costs to taxpayers including hidden elements (e.g., the Royal Protection security bill and lost rental income from palaces and state-owned land) of the monarchy are £334&nbsp;million per annum.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal finances|url=https://republic.org.uk/what-we-want/royal-finances|website=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]|access-date=20 August 2015|date=30 December 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' claims the monarchy costs each adult in Britain around 62p a year.<ref name="R000062">{{cite news |title=Britain should get rid of the monarchy, says UN |date=14 June 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/2122182/Britain-should-get-rid-of-the-monarchy,-says-UN.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |author=Allen, Nick |access-date=28 September 2008 |location=London}}</ref> However, this figure does not take into account royal security, nor the money paid by regional councils to fund the costs of visits by members of the Royal Family, and assumes the "official" figure of £34m per annum to be divided between every man, woman and child in the land. Republic also argues that the Royal finances, which are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act, are shrouded in secrecy and should be subject to greater scrutiny. Although monarchists argue that this does not take into account the "hereditary revenues" which generated £190.8&nbsp;million for the treasury in 2007–2008, republicans assert that the Crown Estate, from which these revenues are derived, is national and State property, and that the monarch cannot surrender what they have never owned.<ref name=Republic>{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/Royal%20finances/index.php|title=Royal Finances|publisher=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]]|access-date=1 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704074840/http://www.republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/Royal%20finances/index.php|archive-date=4 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The monarchy is estimated to cost British taxpayers £202.4m, when costs such as security are included, making it the most expensive monarchy in Europe and 112 times more expensive than the [[President of Ireland|presidency of the Republic of Ireland]].<ref name=Republic/> The argument that tourism benefits from the continued existence of the British monarchy is refuted by Republic, who suggest that the reverse may actually be true – if the palaces were open throughout the year, tourists would be better able to visit them (as has happened with the Tower of London).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/Tourism/index.php |title=Tourism |publisher=[[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]] |access-date=6 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822145948/http://www.republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20depth/Tourism/index.php |archive-date=22 August 2011 }}</ref>
;The monarchy makes the UK appear "backward"
:Republicans argue that the monarchy is to be considered embarrassing: as a concept it is archaic, too reminiscent of medieval feudalism, and while the UK has a hereditary head of state it cannot claim to be a modern nation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Blain|first=Neil|author2=O'Donnell, Hugh|title=Media, monarchy and power|publisher=Intellect Books|year=2003|page=40|isbn=978-1-84150-043-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Long|first=Phil|author2=Palmer, Nicola J. |title=Royal tourism: excursions around monarchy|publisher=Channel View Publications|year=2007|pages=3–4|isbn=978-1-84541-080-3}}</ref>

==Arguments in favour of constitutional monarchy==
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}

===Monarchy can be complementary to rather than a replacement for democracy===
Some argue that the current system is still democratic as the Government and MPs of Parliament are elected by universal suffrage and as the Crown acts only on the advice of the Parliament, the people still hold power. Monarchy only refers to how the head of state is chosen and not how the Government is chosen. It is only undemocratic if the monarchy holds meaningful power, which it currently does not as government rests with Parliament. However, it was revealed in October 2011 that both the Queen and Prince Charles do have the power to veto government legislation which affects their private interests.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/31/secret-royal-veto-powers-exposed |work=The Guardian |title=Secret royal veto powers over new laws to be exposed |date=31 August 2012 |location=London |first=Robert |last=Booth}}</ref> The Queen attended a cabinet meeting on 18 December 2012 – the first Monarch to have done so since [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1781.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/18/queen-attends-cabinet-meeting |work=The Guardian |title=Queen attends cabinet meeting |date=18 December 2012 |location=London |first1=Rajeev |last1=Syal |first2=Helene |last2=Mulholland}}</ref>

===Provides a safeguard against government instability===
Some argue that the Monarch's constitutional position (with the little-used power to dissolve or refuse a government) could safeguard against Britain ever becoming a dictatorship; however, Republic has denied claims that the monarchy has this sort of power. Examples of this argument being used often include the [[Manoonkrit Roopkachorn#Attempted coup of 1981|1981 April Fool's Day Coup]] in [[Thailand]] and the [[23-F|El Tejerazo coup]] in [[Spain]] when [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|King Bhumibol]] and [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I]] respectively stepped in to restore democracy in their countries, or when [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] dismissed and ordered the arrest of [[Benito Mussolini]].

===Safeguards the constitutional rights of the individual===
The [[British constitution]]al system sets limits on Parliament and separates the executive from direct control over the police and courts. Constitutionalists argue<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitutional Monarchy |website=British Monarchist League|url=http://www.monarchist.org.uk/constitutional-monarchy.html|access-date=6 July 2011}}</ref> that this is because contracts with the monarch such as the [[Magna Carta]], the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Declaration of Rights]], the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] and the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] place obligations on the state and<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitutional Matters|website=The Baronage Press Ltd|url=http://www.baronage.co.uk/bphtm-01/const-01.html|year=1995|access-date=6 July 2011}}</ref> confirm its citizens as sovereign beings. These obligations are re-affirmed at every monarch's coronation. These obligations, whilst at the same time placing limits on the power of the judiciary and the police, also confirm those rights which are intrinsically part of British and especially English culture.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-00293.pdf House of Commons Library] 6 July 2011</ref>  Examples are [[Common Law]], the particular status of ancient practices, [[jury trial]]s, legal [[precedent]], protection against non-judicial seizure and the [[right to protest]].

===Provides a focal point for unity and tradition===
Monarchists argue that a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]] with limited powers and non-partisan nature can provide a focus for national unity, national awards and honours, national institutions, and allegiance, as opposed to a president affiliated to a political party.<ref>Bogdanor, V. (1997). The Monarchy and the Constitution. ch11</ref>

===If there were a republic, the costs may remain the same===
Some argue that if there were a republic, the costs incurred in regards to the duties of the head of state would remain more or less the same. This includes the upkeep and conservation of the royal palaces and buildings which would still have to be paid for as they belong to the nation as a whole rather than the monarch personally. On top of that, the head of state would require a salary and security, state visits, banquets and ceremonial duties would still go ahead. In 2009, the monarchy claimed to be costing each person an estimated 69 pence a year (not including "a hefty security bill").<ref>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=The Star|url=https://www.thestar.com/blogs/article/943470--the-prince-the-dukedom-and-jack-the-ripper|date=6 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024125802/http://www.thestar.com/blogs/article/943470--the-prince-the-dukedom-and-jack-the-ripper |archive-date=24 October 2012|title=The cost of the British Monarchy?

===A British Republic has already been tested and failed===
Even though no modern republicans advocate a republic modelled on Cromwell's Protectorate, some<ref>David Plant, The Rump Parliament, British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website
http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/rump-parliament.htm 6 July 2011</ref> point out that a Republican government under the [[Commonwealth of England]] and then the [[Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland]] has already been tried when [[Oliver Cromwell]] installed it on 30 January 1649. Yet by February 1657 some people<ref>A group of MPs headed by Lord Broghill, David Plant, Biography of Oliver Cromwell, British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/oliver-cromwell.htm 6 July 2011</ref> argued that Cromwell should assume [[the crown]] as it would stabilise the constitution, limit his powers and restore [[precedent]]. Cromwell declined. Within three years of his death the Republic had lost support and the monarchy was restored. Later, during [[The Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 caused partially by disillusionment with the absolutist rule of the Scottish [[James II and VII]], Parliament and others, such as [[John Locke]]<ref>The philosopher John Locke, 'John Locke Natural Rights to Life, Liberty, and Property', Jim Powell, senior fellow, Cato Institute, {{cite web|url=http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-02-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307200514/http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property/ |archive-date= 7 March 2012 |df=dmy }} 6 July 2011</ref> argued that James had broken "the original contract" with the state. Far from pressing for a republic, which had been experienced within living memory, they instead argued that the best form of government was a [[constitutional monarchy]] with explicitly circumscribed powers. (This overlooks a few factors, however – Cromwell's republic was based on the ideals of puritanism and land-based privilege, whilst modern republican advocates have strong links to secularism and expansion of democracy. Cromwell was also not a republican in the strict sense, and opposed groups that were, such as the [[Levellers]]).
