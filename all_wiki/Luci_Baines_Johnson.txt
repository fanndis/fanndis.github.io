'''Luci Baines Johnson Turpin''' (née '''Johnson''', formerly '''Nugent''', born July 2, 1947) is an American businesswoman and [[philanthropist]]. She is the younger daughter of U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his wife, former [[First Lady]] [[Lady Bird Johnson]].

==Early years==
Born in [[Washington, D.C.]], Johnson has an older sister [[Lynda Bird Johnson Robb|Lynda Bird]]. Johnson's first name was originally spelled "Lucy"; she changed the spelling in her teens as a rebellion towards her parents. As her parents both had the initials LBJ, they named their two daughters to have these initials also.<ref name="russell1">{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/content/luci-sky|title=Luci in the Sky|last=Jarboe Russell|first=Jan|date=March 1998|publisher=texasmonthly.com|page=1|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}</ref> Although her father was a member of the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], her mother was an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]], and she and her older sister, [[Lynda Bird]], were raised as Episcopalians. Johnson converted to [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholicism]] at the age of eighteen, when she requested and received [[conditional baptism]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C04E4DA1030E23ABC4B53DFB166838E679EDE|title=Luci Johnson, 18, Turns, Catholic; Luci Johnson, 18, Becomes Catholic|last=Semple|first=Robert B. Jr.|date=July 3, 1965|work=The New York Times|page=1}}</ref> Johnson had been baptized with water and in the name of the [[Trinity]] at five months old by an Episcopal priest in Austin, Texas. Her rebaptism caused protests from leading figures in the Episcopal Church, which made headlines, as the Roman Catholic teaching does not require converts who are already baptized to receive baptism a second time.<ref name=Time/>

She was sixteen when President [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated in Dallas]] on November 22, 1963. Johnson heard of the assassination while attending a Spanish class at the [[National Cathedral School]]. She was unaware whether her father had been injured as well but realized he had been sworn in as the 36th President of the United States when [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents showed up on her school campus a few hours later.<ref name="russell1"/> She later attended [[Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies]] but dropped out in 1966 as the school prohibited married students (Johnson married her first husband in August 1966).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/content/luci-sky/page/0/1|title=Luci in the Sky|last=Jarboe Russell|first=Jan|date=March 1998|publisher=texasmonthly.com|page=2|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
Since 1993, Johnson has been the Chairman of the Board and manager of LBJ Asset Management Partners, a family office, as well as Chairman of the Board of [[BusinesSuites]], a national operator of executive suites, which she co-founded with her husband in 1989. She received a BLS in Communication from [[St. Edward's University]] in 1997.<ref name="russell1"/>

She is on the Board of Directors of the LBJ Foundation and has served on multiple civic boards, raising funds for [[The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]] and the [[American Heart Association]], acting as [[trustee]] of [[Boston University]], and as a member of the advisory board of the Center for Battered Women.<ref name=Time>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,834006,00.html Baptism of Fire], Time, July 16, 1965</ref>

On August 6, 1966, Johnson married [[Air National Guard]]sman Patrick John "Pat" Nugent in front of 700 guests at the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]] in Washington, D.C.. The wedding was broadcast on television (drawing 55 million viewers) and was featured on the August 19, 1966, cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realsimple.com/weddings/dress-attire/celebrity-wedding-dresses-0/lucy-baines-johnson|title=Memorable Celebrity Wedding Dresses|last=Fritz|first=Maura|publisher=realsimple.com|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=August 19, 1966|title=The Splendor of Luci's Wedding|journal=Life|publisher=Time Inc.|volume=61|issue=8|pages=21–27|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qlUEAAAAMBAJ&q=luci+johnson+wedding+life+magazine}}</ref>
