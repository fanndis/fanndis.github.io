==Early life and career==
Grassley was born in [[New Hartford, Iowa]], the son of Ruth (née Corwin) and Louis Arthur Grassley,<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/senators/grassley.htm Ancestors of Charles Ernest Grassley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509235407/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/senators/grassley.htm |date=May 9, 2007 }}. rootsweb.com.</ref> and raised on a farm. He graduated from the town high school. At [[University of Northern Iowa|Iowa State Teachers College]] (now the University of Northern Iowa), he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1955 and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[political science]] in 1956. During his time as a student, Grassley joined the social-professional [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greeks in the 113th Congress |url=http://www.nicindy.org/blog/greeks-in-the-113th-congress/ |publisher=North-American Interfraternity Conference |accessdate=September 2, 2013 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327052229/http://www.nicindy.org/blog/greeks-in-the-113th-congress/ |archivedate=March 27, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>  Also during the 1950s, Grassley farmed and worked in factories in Iowa, first as a [[sheet metal]] shearer and then as an [[assembly line]] worker. He pursued a Ph.D. in political science at the [[University of Iowa]], but ultimately did not complete the degree. From 1967 to 1968, Grassley taught at [[Charles City College]].<ref name=IAlegis00/>

Grassley represented parts of [[Butler County, Iowa|Butler County]] in the [[Iowa House of Representatives]] from 1959 to 1975.<ref name=IAlegis00>{{cite web |url=https://www.legis.iowa.gov/Legislators/legislatorAllYears.aspx?PID=253 |title=Charles Grassley |accessdate=May 25, 2012 |work=www.legis.iowa.gov |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121213143203/https://www.legis.iowa.gov/Legislators/legislatorAllYears.aspx?PID=253 |archivedate=December 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He then served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1975 to 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress - Grassley, Charles Ernest - Biographical Information|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000386|publisher=Office of Art and Archives and Office of the Historian, The United States Congress|accessdate=April 21, 2013|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310095205/http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000386|archivedate=March 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In November 1981, Grassley was one of 32 senators to sign a letter to President Reagan supporting Director of the Office of Management and Budget [[David Stockman]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/14/us/32-gop-senators-praise-stockman-others-skeptical.html|title=32 G.O.P.

In October 1983, Grassley voted against establishing a legal holiday to commemorate [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s birthday.<ref>{{cite news |title=SENATE'S ROLL-CALL VOTE ON KING HOLIDAY |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/20/us/senate-s-roll-call-vote-on-king-holiday.html |accessdate=January 24, 2019 |work=New York Times |date=October 20, 1983 |archive-date=January 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114084211/https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/20/us/senate-s-roll-call-vote-on-king-holiday.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2015, an aide to Grassley said that he voted against the holiday due to an "economic decision both in the cost to the broader economy in lost productivity, and the cost to the taxpayers with the federal government closed."<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Kamisar|first1=Ben|title=Lawmakers reflect on MLK Day 'no' votes|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/229844-lawmakers-reflect-on-no-votes-on-mlk-day|newspaper=The Hill|quote=Grassley aide: "Senator Grassley’s vote against an MLK Day holiday was purely an economic decision both in the cost to the broader economy in lost productivity, and the cost to the taxpayers with the federal government closed"|date=January 18, 2015|access-date=December 22, 2019|archive-date=December 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222203623/https://thehill.com/homenews/229844-lawmakers-reflect-on-no-votes-on-mlk-day|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2004, Grassley co-sponsored legislation giving King a posthumous award, which became law on October 25 that year.<ref>{{Cite web|title=S.1368 - A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on behalf of the Congress to Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. (posthumously) and his widow Coretta Scott King in recognition of their contributions to the Nation on behalf of the civil rights movement.|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-bill/1368/cosponsors%20?searchResultViewType=expanded|website=congress.gov|year=2003–2004|access-date=December 22, 2019|archive-date=July 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728143202/https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-bill/1368/cosponsors%20?searchResultViewType=expanded|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Some evolved on MLK honor|url=https://www.newsday.com/opinion/editorial/mlk-jr-day-history-1.26111828|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=January 20, 2019|access-date=December 22, 2019|archive-date=December 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222203625/https://www.newsday.com/opinion/editorial/mlk-jr-day-history-1.26111828|url-status=live}}</ref>

On November 1, 1984, Grassley signed a one-page citation of contempt of Congress against Attorney General [[William French Smith]] due to Smith's not turning over files on an investigation into Navy shipbuilding. Assistant Attorney General Stephen S. Trott called the citation "out of place" since Grassley was not acting at a session of the Judiciary panel he led.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/01/business/contempt-citation-in-dynamics-case.html|title=Contempt Citation in Dynamics Case|author=Biddle, Wayne|date=November 1, 1984|work=New York Times|access-date=July 26, 2018|archive-date=July 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726201935/https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/01/business/contempt-citation-in-dynamics-case.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 1987, the Senate Appropriations Committee defeated an attempt by Grassley to hasten payments of corn and other feed grain subsidies ahead of the scheduled payment taking place after October 1. The Grassley measure was also designed to unravel an accounting device lawmakers used previously to make it appear that they were reducing spending for the incoming fiscal year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/05/01/Government-suspends-farm-price-support-payments/4468546840000/?tt=6|title=Government suspends farm price support payments|date=May 1, 1987|publisher=UPI|access-date=August 12, 2018|archive-date=August 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813004256/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/05/01/Government-suspends-farm-price-support-payments/4468546840000/?tt=6|url-status=live}}</ref> In October, during a press briefing, Grassley accused Reagan of being "asleep at the switch" and botching the handling of [[Robert Bork]]'s Supreme Court nomination, adding that Bork's nomination had convinced him that the Reagan administration "has been terribly lucky for the last seven years" in other matters, including the economy and foreign policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/10/08/Sen-Charles-Grassley-R-Iowa-a-leading-conservative-supporter-of/2021560664000/|title=Sen.

All you have to do is repeat the same outrageous charges, and repeat them so often that people believe they are true."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/10/22/Supporters-of-Robert-Borks-Supreme-Court-nomination-renewed-their/3131561873600/|title=Supporters of Robert Bork's Supreme Court nomination renewed their...|date=October 22, 1987|publisher=UPI|access-date=August 12, 2018|archive-date=August 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813005324/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/10/22/Supporters-of-Robert-Borks-Supreme-Court-nomination-renewed-their/3131561873600/|url-status=live}}</ref> In November, as party leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee met on the Supreme Court nomination of [[Douglas H.

Grassley stated his distaste for "the people who are committed to changing the judiciary" and taking "the path of least resistance."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/11/10/President-Reagan-nominates-Judge-Anthony-Kennedy-to-Supreme-Court/1605563518800/|title=President Reagan nominates Judge Anthony Kennedy to Supreme Court|first=Helen|last=Thomas|date=November 10, 1987|publisher=UPI|access-date=August 12, 2018|archive-date=August 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813043303/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/11/10/President-Reagan-nominates-Judge-Anthony-Kennedy-to-Supreme-Court/1605563518800/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2001, Grassley met with Democratic senator [[Max Baucus]] over the allocation of finances in tax cuts and both reported they were making progress in reaching a bipartisan deal, Grassley adding that the bill would contain all four of the main elements proposed by the Bush administration and the Senate Finance Committee would modify the components of the Bush proposal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/us/panel-reaches-deal-on-budget-framework.html|title=Panel Reaches Deal on Budget Framework|date=May 9, 2001|first1=Richard W.|last1=Stevenson|first2=David E.|last2=Rosenbaum|work=New York Times|access-date=July 26, 2018|archive-date=February 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213180502/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/us/panel-reaches-deal-on-budget-framework.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In August 2002, Grassley sent a letter to president and chief executive of the [[United Way of America]] Brian Gallagher requesting a detailed explanation on the overseeing of both finances and management of the organization's affiliates.

As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley has spearheaded many probes into alleged misuse and lack of accountability of federal money. In July 2007, a Grassley-commissioned report was released claiming that more than US$1 billion in [[agricultural subsidy|farm subsidies]] were sent to deceased individuals.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003803149_watch24.html | title = Dead farmers got subsidies | work = The Seattle Times | date = July 24, 2007 | accessdate = July 24, 2007 |url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929143432/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003803149_watch24.html | archivedate = September 29, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>  Grassley was called a "Taxpayer Super Hero" in 2014 by the Council for [[Citizens Against Government Waste]], for his efforts to protect taxpayers.

In February 2004, Grassley released an internal report composed by the FBI in 2000 that examined 107 instances of either serious or criminal misconduct by its agents over a 16-year period. In a letter to the FBI, Grassley called the report "a laundry list of horrors with examples of agents who committed rape, sexual crimes against children, other sexual deviance and misconduct, attempted murder of a spouse, and narcotics violations, among many others" and added that the report's findings raised questions about whether the FBI handled agents "soon enough and rigorously enough".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/19/us/senator-says-report-chronicling-misconduct-by-fbi-agents-is-a-list-of-horrors.html|title=Senator Says Report Chronicling Misconduct by F.B.I.

Since 1976, Grassley has repeatedly introduced measures that increase the level of [[Taxation in the United States|taxation]] on American citizens living abroad, including retroactive tax hikes. Grassley was eventually able to attach an amendment to a piece of legislation that went into effect in 2006, which increased taxes on Americans abroad by targeting housing and living incentives paid by foreign employers and held them accountable for federal taxes, even though they did not currently reside in the United States. Critics of the amendment felt that the move hurt Americans competing for jobs abroad by putting an unnecessary tax burden on foreign employers. Others felt that the move was only to offset the revenue deficit caused by [[Bush tax cuts|domestic tax cuts]] of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]].<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/30/business/30tax.html | work = The New York Times | title = Americans Living Abroad Get a Nasty Tax Surprise | first1 = Keith | last1 = Bradsher | date = May 30, 2006 | accessdate = April 30, 2010 |url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110512165003/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/30/business/30tax.html | archivedate = May 12, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/12/news/expats.php | title = Americans abroad face higher United States tax bills | work = [[International Herald Tribune]] | first = Dan | last = Bilefsky | date = May 12, 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060619204314/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/12/news/expats.php | archivedate = June 19, 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aca.ch/cadtaxlt.htm Senator Charles Grassley’s Letter of October 3rd 2007 in the Wall Street Journal Provokes Vivid Response.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201150031/http://www.aca.ch/cadtaxlt.htm |date=February 1, 2009 }}</ref>

In March 2009, amid a scandal that involved [[American International Group|AIG]] executives receiving large salary bonuses from the taxpayer-funded bailout of AIG, Grassley suggested that those AIG employees receiving large bonuses should follow the so-called 'Japanese example', resign immediately or commit [[Seppuku|suicide]].

In 2010, Grassley had an "A" rating from the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA).<ref name="Vote Smart1004G">{{cite web|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|url=https://votesmart.org/interest-group/1324/rating/5589#.WdUz0RNSxE4|website=Vote Smart|accessdate=4 October 2017|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005000427/https://votesmart.org/interest-group/1324/rating/5589#.WdUz0RNSxE4|archivedate=October 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> According to a source from [[Splinter News]], Grassley received $9,900 from the NRA during his 2016 election.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Rafi|title=Every Member of Congress Who Took Money From the NRA and Tweeted 'Thoughts and Prayers' to Las Vegas|url=https://splinternews.com/every-member-of-congress-who-took-money-from-the-nra-an-1819059582|website=Splinter News|date=October 10, 2017|access-date=December 22, 2019|archive-date=December 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222204428/https://splinternews.com/every-member-of-congress-who-took-money-from-the-nra-an-1819059582|url-status=live}}</ref>

Grassley is a staunch believer that gun laws will not prevent gun deaths or gun-related violence without improved mental health care.<ref name="Shabad1004G">{{cite web|last1=Shabad|first1=Rebecca|title=Grassley: Gun control ineffective until mental issues are addressed|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/323037-grassley-gun-control-ineffective-until-mental-issues-are-addressed|website=TheHill|accessdate=4 October 2017|date=18 September 2013|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005100653/http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/323037-grassley-gun-control-ineffective-until-mental-issues-are-addressed|archivedate=October 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Grassley opposed the Manchin-Toomey gun control amendment, and instead proposed alternative legislation to increase prosecutions of gun violence and increase reporting of mental health data in background checks.<ref name="Ed Tibbetts"/>

===Health care===
Grassley has been critical of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] but does not believe the law can be completely repealed. He believes some degree of bipartisanship will be necessary to make changes to the law. He believes a solution will likely involve removing unpopular aspects of the law, like the individual mandate, while keeping popular aspects of it that deal with pre-existing conditions and the ability for children to remain on their parents' plans longer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thonline.com/news/tri-state/article_db8fe687-7b08-5999-a533-b0cce7cdddef.html|title=Grassley eyes Obamacare cure|work=thonline.com|date=August 29, 2015|accessdate=September 27, 2015|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901214138/http://www.thonline.com/news/tri-state/article_db8fe687-7b08-5999-a533-b0cce7cdddef.html|archivedate=September 1, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Grassley believes that the [[2017 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act replacement proposals#Senate legislation|Senate's version of the AHCA]] (the repeal of the ACA passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House]]), will provide health insurers certainty.

He said that with the proposed legislation premiums "maybe wouldn't go up or would go up a heck of a lot less than they would without a bill."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/16/15810524/senate-ahca-explain-please|title=We asked 8 Senate Republicans to explain what their health bill is trying to do|last1=Golshan|first1=Tara|date=June 16, 2017|work=Vox|access-date=2017-06-17|last2=Scott|first2=Dylan|last3=Stein|first3=Jeff|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616215038/https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/16/15810524/senate-ahca-explain-please|archivedate=June 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In July 2017, Grassley stated that Senate Republicans should be ashamed for not having passed their healthcare bill and this could translate to a loss of their majority in the 2018 elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/341152-grassley-republicans-will-lose-senate-majority-without|title=Grassley: GOP will lose Senate majority without healthcare reform|author=Byrnes, Jason|date=July 8, 2017|work=The Hill|access-date=August 24, 2018|archive-date=August 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825002457/http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/341152-grassley-republicans-will-lose-senate-majority-without|url-status=live}}</ref>

In August 2018, Grassley was one of ten Republican senators to cosponsor legislation intended to protect ObamaCare provisions for people with pre-existing conditions.<ref name=":3">{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/403459-ten-gop-senators-introduce-bill-aimed-at-preserving-obamacares-pre-existing|title=GOP senators introduce bill to preserve ObamaCare's pre-existing conditions protections|author=Hellmann, Jessie|date=August 24, 2018|work=The Hill|access-date=August 24, 2018|archive-date=August 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824200326/http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/403459-ten-gop-senators-introduce-bill-aimed-at-preserving-obamacares-pre-existing|url-status=live}}</ref> Health experts said that the bill did not prevent insurers from excluding coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions.<ref name=":3" />

===Marijuana===
In 2015, Grassley voiced his opposition to a bipartisan senate bill, [[Cannabis in the United States#Federal|the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act]], that would move [[cannabis]] from Schedule I to Schedule II. This bill would allow states with [[medical cannabis]] laws to legally prescribe it and allow for more research into its medical efficacy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leys|first1=Tony|title=Grassley opposes medical marijuana rescheduling|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2015/03/11/chuck-grassley-medical-marijuana/70170440/|publisher=Des Moines Register|accessdate=March 11, 2015|archive-date=November 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113030255/https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2015/03/11/chuck-grassley-medical-marijuana/70170440/|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2019, along with Democratic U.S. Senators [[Dianne Feinstein]] and [[Brian Schatz]], Grassley introduced the Cannabidiol and Marijuana Research Expansion Act, which would expand research into medical marijuana.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Staff |first1=National Desk |title=Live updates: Largest Nevada county still tallying mail votes |url=https://www.ketv.com/article/national-updates-and-results-presidential-race-and-us-voting/34561805 |accessdate=5 November 2020 |work=KETV |date=5 November 2020 |language=en |archive-date=November 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201104050447/https://www.ketv.com/article/national-updates-and-results-presidential-race-and-us-voting/34561805 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Israel Anti-Boycott Act===
In April 2017, Grassley co-sponsored the [[Israel Anti-Boycott Act]] (s. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against [[Israel]] and [[Israeli settlement]]s in the [[West Bank]] if protesting actions by the Israeli government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/720/cosponsors|title=Cosponsors - S.720 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Israel Anti-Boycott Act|date=23 March 2017|website=www.congress.gov|access-date=September 24, 2019|archive-date=June 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200621142604/https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/720/cosponsors|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/senate-bill-would-make-it-a-federal-crime-to-boycott-israel.html|title=43 Senators Want to Make It a Federal Crime to Boycott Israeli Settlements|last=Levitz|first=Eric|date=2017-07-19|website=Intelligencer|language=en|access-date=September 24, 2019|archive-date=July 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727013113/https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/senate-bill-would-make-it-a-federal-crime-to-boycott-israel.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2019, Grassley was one of 14 Republican senators to sign a letter from [[Marco Rubio]] that involved condemning the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS movement]].<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Vlahos|first1=Kelley|title=Israel Boycott Exposes Serious Rifts in the Democratic Party|url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/israel-boycott-exposes-serious-rifts-in-the-democratic-party/|newspaper=[[The American Conservative]]|date=March 5, 2019|access-date=December 25, 2019|archive-date=December 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225195452/https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/israel-boycott-exposes-serious-rifts-in-the-democratic-party/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Retirement planning===
In 2019, Grassley was one of the lead Senate co-sponsors of the [[Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019|SECURE Act of 2019]]. This bill, which became law as part of the [[2020 United States federal budget|fiscal year 2020 federal appropriations law]] signed in late December 2019, was intended to incentivize retirement planning, diversify the options available to savers, and increase access to tax-advantaged savings programs including [[529 plans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/12/23/new-law-is-bringing-big-changes-retirement-savers-especially-parents|title=A new law is bringing big changes for retirement savers, especially parents|last=Singletary|first=Michelle|date=2019-12-23|website=The Washington Post|access-date=2019-12-30|archive-date=December 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230190906/https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/12/23/new-law-is-bringing-big-changes-retirement-savers-especially-parents/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Russian interference in 2016 elections===

In January 2018, and in the first known congressional [[criminal referral]] in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Grassley, along with [[Lindsey Graham]], recommended charges against Christopher Steele, one of the people who sought to expose Russian interference.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/us/politics/christopher-steele-dossier-judiciary-committee.html|title=Republican Senators Recommend Charges Against Author of Trump Dossier|last1=Fandos|first1=Nicholas|date=2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-05|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Matthew|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=January 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105191310/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/us/politics/christopher-steele-dossier-judiciary-committee.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Grassley and Graham said that they had reason to believe that Steele had lied to federal authorities.<ref name=":1" /> According to ''The New York Times'', "It was not clear why, if a crime is apparent in the F.B.I. reports that were reviewed by the Judiciary Committee, the Justice Department had not moved to charge Mr. Steele already.

In January 2018, when Grassley and Judiciary Committee Republicans were refusing to release the full transcript of an August 2017 ten-hour interview that the Judiciary Committee had conducted with [[Glenn R.

===Whistleblowers===
The author of the [[Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989]], Grassley has campaigned to increase protection and provide support for "[[whistleblowers]]".

==Investigations==
===Religious organizations===
{{main|United States Senate inquiry into the tax-exempt status of religious organizations}}
On November 5, 2007, Grassley announced an investigation into the tax-exempt status of six ministries under the leadership of [[Benny Hinn]], [[Paula White]], [[Eddie L. Long]], [[Joyce Meyer]], [[Creflo Dollar]], and [[Kenneth Copeland]] by the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16860611|title=Senator Probes Megachurches' Finances|publisher=NPR.org|first=Kathy|last=Lohr|date=December 4, 2007|accessdate=December 10, 2007|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206080710/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16860611|archivedate=December 6, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In letters to each ministry, Grassley asked for the ministries to divulge specific financial information to the committee to determine whether or not funds collected by each organization were inappropriately utilized by ministry heads.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/06/cbsnews_investigates/main3462147.shtml|title=Televangelists Living Like Kings?|publisher=CBS News|date=November 6, 2007|accessdate=September 17, 2007|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109112841/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/06/cbsnews_investigates/main3462147.shtml|archivedate=November 9, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> By the December 6, 2007 deadline, only three of the ministries had shown compliance with the Finance Committee's request. On March 11, 2008, Grassley and Finance chairman Max Baucus sent follow-up letters to Kenneth Copeland, Creflo Dollar and Eddie Long, explaining that the Senate reserved the right to investigate the finances of their organizations under federal tax laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pgdc.com/pgdc/grassley-baucus-urge-four-ministries-cooperate|title=Grassley, Baucus Urge Four Ministries to Cooperate|publisher=Planned Giving Design Center|date=March 12, 2008|accessdate=February 4, 2009|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126121815/http://www.pgdc.com/pgdc/grassley-baucus-urge-four-ministries-cooperate|archivedate=January 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Medical research===
Grassley also began an investigation about unreported payments to physicians by pharmaceutical companies.  Grassley led a 2008 Congressional Investigation which found that well-known university [[psychiatrist]]s, who had promoted [[psychoactive drug]]s, had violated federal and university regulations by secretly receiving large sums of money from the pharmaceutical companies which made the drugs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kirk|first=Stuart A.|title=Mad Science: Psychiatric Coercion, Diagnosis, and Drugs|year=2013|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=21}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that [[Joseph Biederman]] of Harvard University had failed to report over a million dollars of income that he had received from pharmaceutical companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/us/08conflict.html|title=Researchers Fail to Reveal Full Drug Pay|work=The New York Times|first1=Gardiner|last1=Harris|first2=Benedict|last2=Carey|date=June 8, 2008|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210021458/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/us/08conflict.html|archivedate=December 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Weeks later, Business Week reported that Grassley alleged that [[Alan Schatzberg]], chair of psychiatry at [[Stanford University]], had underreported his investments in [[Corcept Therapeutics]], a company he founded.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2008/tc20080626_630542.htm|title=Drug Makers and College Labs: Too Cozy?|work=Business Week|first=Arlene|last=Weintraub|date=June 26, 2008|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524003304/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2008/tc20080626_630542.htm|archivedate=May 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Schatzberg had reported only $100,000 investments in Corcept, but Grassley stated that his investments actually totalled over $6 million. Schatzberg later stepped down from his grant which is funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/news/article/4922/stanford-researcher-accused-of-conflicts-steps-down-as-nih-principal-investigator|title=Stanford Researcher, Accused of Conflicts, Steps Down as NIH Principal Investigator|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=August 1, 2008|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201150934/http://chronicle.com/news/article/4922/stanford-researcher-accused-of-conflicts-steps-down-as-nih-principal-investigator|archivedate=February 1, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Similarly, [[Charles Nemeroff]] resigned as chair of the psychiatry department at [[Emory University]] after failing to report a third of the $2.8 million in consulting fees he received from [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. At the time he received these fees, Nemeroff had been principal investigator of a $3.9 million NIH grant evaluating five medications for depression manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/04/science/sci-doctors4|title=Doctor Accused in Congress' Probe|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=October 4, 2008|first1=Denise|last1=Gellene|first2=Thomas H.|last2=Maugh II|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201144702/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/04/science/sci-doctors4|archivedate=February 1, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2008, for the first time, Grassley asked the [[American Psychiatric Association]] to disclose how much of its annual budget came from drug industry funds. The APA said that industry contributed 28% of its budget ($14 million at that time), mainly through paid advertising in APA journals and funds for continuing medical education.<ref name=stuarta>{{cite book|last=Kirk|first=Stuart A.|title=Mad Science: Psychiatric Coercion, Diagnosis, and Drugs|year=2013|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=217}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
Grassley was elected to his Senate seat in 1980, defeating the Democratic incumbent, [[John Culver]]. He was reelected in 1986, 1992, 1998, 2004, 2010 and 2016; he is the longest-serving senator in Iowa history. In 1992, he won a third term with 69 percent of the vote even as [[Bill Clinton]] carried the state in the presidential election.

===2010===
{{Main|2010 United States Senate election in Iowa}}
Grassley sought a sixth term in the 2010 election.  He was challenged by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Roxanne Conlin]], a former [[United States Attorney|United States attorney]], and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] John Heiderscheit, an attorney.

Grassley was unopposed in the Republican primary, although some conservatives said he had drifted "too far to the left".<ref>{{cite web | last = Hancock | first = Jason | url = http://iowaindependent.com/13888/salier-grassley-could-be-primaried | title = Salier: Grassley could be primaried | work= The Iowa Independent | date = April 10, 2009 | accessdate = August 23, 2010 |url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://archive.today/20120715164507/http://iowaindependent.com/13888/salier-grassley-could-be-primaried | archivedate = July 15, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Grassley was reelected with 64.5% of the vote, Roxanne Conlin getting 33.2% of the vote.  He carried every county in the state except [[Johnson County, Iowa|Johnson County]],<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2010/results/county/#IAS01map | work=CNN | title=County Results - Election Center 2010 - Elections & Politics from CNN.com |url-status = live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112125416/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2010/results/county/#IAS01map | archivedate=November 12, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> which hosts the [[University of Iowa]].   He is only the second Iowan to serve six terms in the Senate; the other being Iowa's longest-serving senator, [[William B. Allison]].

===2016===

[[File:Chuck Grassley by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Grassley speaking at the 2016 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC) in Washington, D.C.]]
Grassley sought a seventh term in the 2016 election.  Distinct from 2010, he was expected to face a strong challenge from former Democratic lieutenant governor [[Patty Judge]],<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/us/politics/charles-grassley-patty-judge-iowa-senate-race.html | work=NY Times | title=Charles Grassley Faces Formidable Challenger in Iowa Senate Race |first1=Jennifer|last1=Steinhauer|first2=David M.|last2=Herszenhorn|url-status = live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050502/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/us/politics/charles-grassley-patty-judge-iowa-senate-race.html | archivedate=March 4, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> but he won his seventh term with over 60% of the vote as the Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] won the state with over 51% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/iowa-president-clinton-trump|title=Iowa Presidential Race Results: Donald J.
