{{short description|Government position in some countries secondary to the prime minister}}
A '''deputy prime minister''' or '''vice prime minister''' is, in some countries, a [[Minister (government)|government minister]] who can take the position of acting [[prime minister]] when the prime minister is temporarily absent. The position is often likened to that of a [[vice president]], as both positions are "number two" offices, but there are some differences. 

The states of [[Australia]] and provinces of [[Canada]] each have the analogous office of deputy premier. In the [[devolution|devolved]] administrations of the [[United Kingdom]], an analogous position is that of the [[First Minister of Northern Ireland|deputy First Minister]], albeit the position in [[Northern Ireland]] has equivalent powers to the First Minister differing only in the titles of the offices. In Canada, the position of deputy prime minister should not be confused with the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Deputy Minister (Canada)|Deputy Minister]] of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], a nonpolitical [[civil servant]] position. 

A deputy prime minister traditionally serves as acting prime minister when the prime minister is temporarily absent or incapable of exercising power. The deputy prime minister is often asked to succeed to the prime minister's office following the prime minister's sudden death or unexpected resignation, but that is not necessarily mandated by the constitution. This government position is often a job that is held simultaneously with another ministry, and is usually given to one of the most senior or experienced ministers of the cabinet. The holder of this office may also be [[deputy leader]] of the governing party, or perhaps the leader of the junior party of a [[coalition government]].

Little scholarly attention has focused on deputy prime ministers, as they are sometimes less involved in the political power plays of government and more focus on the work at hand. A 2009 study in ''Political Science'' identified nine 'qualities' of deputy prime ministership: temperament; relationships with their Cabinet and caucus; relationships with their party; popularity with the public; media skills; achievements as deputy prime minister; relationship with the prime minister; leadership ambition; and method of succession.<ref>Steven Barnes, 'What About Me? Deputy Prime Ministership in New Zealand', Political Science, Vol. 61, No. 1, 2009, pp. 33-49</ref>

By contrast, the structure of the [[Government of Russia]]<ref>[[s:Constitution of Russia#CHAPTER 6. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION|Article 110.2 of the Constitution of Russian Federation]]</ref> and [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]] provides for several deputy prime ministers or vice prime ministers.<ref>[[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 114|Article 114 of the Constitution of Ukraine]]</ref> In the case of the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]], the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] is responsible for defining the scope of the duties for each of their deputies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://constitution.garant.ru/act/government/12106440/chapter/4/ |title=Article 25 of the Federal Constitutional Law "On the Government of Russian Federation" from December 17, 1997 |publisher=Constitution.garant.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> who also may head a specific ministry: e.g. the former [[Minister of Finance]] of Russia, [[Alexey Kudrin]], also serves as one of the deputies of the prime ministers or ''vice-premiers''. One or two of these deputy prime ministers may hold the title of a ''First Deputy Prime Minister''. Russian federal law indicates that in accordance with the order established in advance, ''one of the deputy prime ministers'' may temporarily substitute for the Prime Minister in their absence. Customarily, however, it is to one of the "First" Deputy Prime Ministers that the prime-ministerial duties may be delegated. At the same time, in the case of Prime Minister's resignation, the law allows the [[President of Russia]] to choose ''any'' of the current vice-premiers to serve as an ''acting'' Prime Minister until the confirmation of the new government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://constitution.garant.ru/act/government/12106440/chapter/2/ |title=Article 8 of the Federal Constitutional Law "On the Government of Russian Federation |publisher=Constitution.garant.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>
