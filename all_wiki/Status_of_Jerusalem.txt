==Background==

[[File:JerusalemEastAndWest.jpg|right|250px|thumb|http://www.passia.org/maps/view/55<nowiki/>Jerusalem municipal area]]
From the end of the [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17)|Ottoman–Mamluk War in 1517]] until the [[First World War]], Jerusalem was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It was part of the [[Damascus Eyalet|Damascus eyalet]] (province) until, as a result of [[Tanzimat|widespread administrative reform]] in the mid 1800s, it became an [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem|independent]] [[sanjak]] (district) in 1872. Since the 1860s, Jews have formed the largest religious group in the city and since around 1887, with the beginning of expansion outside the old city walls, Jews have been in the majority.<ref>Ruth Kark and Michal Oren-Nordheim (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=KzOAxmHDzHUC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false''Jerusalem and Its Environs: Quarters, Neighborhoods, Villages, 1800–1948'']. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 28.</ref> In the 19th century, European powers vied for influence in the city usually on the basis of extending protection over Christian churches and Holy Places. Much of the property that is now owned by the churches was bought during this time. A number of these countries also established consulates in Jerusalem. After [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|capturing Jerusalem]] in 1917, Great Britain was in control of Jerusalem; initially under a [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration|wartime administration]], it was part of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Mandate of Palestine]] [[San Remo conference|assigned]] to the Britain in 1920. The principal [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] recognized the unique spiritual and religious interests in Jerusalem among the world's [[Abrahamic religions|three great monotheistic religions]] as "a sacred trust of civilization",<ref>[http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/131/131-20040709-ADV-01-00-EN.pdf ''Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory''], Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 2004, p. 165 para. 70.</ref><ref>Paul J.

"The Court ascertained the legal significance of the 'sacred trust of civilization' of the League of Nations (LoN) in respect of the 1922 Palestine Mandate as the origin of the present responsibility of the United Nations".</ref> and stipulated that the existing rights and claims connected with it be safeguarded in perpetuity, under international guarantee.<ref>See, for example, [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/palmanda.asp#art28 Article 28 of the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine].</ref>

However, the Arab and Jewish [[Demographic history of Palestine (region)|communities in Palestine]] were in mortal dispute and Britain sought United Nations assistance in resolving the dispute. In November 1947, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] (Resolution 181), which called for the partition of Palestine into a separate Arab and [[Jewish state]], with Jerusalem (with borders expanded to include Bethlehem) being established as a ''[[corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]]'', or a "separated body", with a special legal and political status, administered by the United Nations.<ref>General Assembly resolution 48/158D, 20 December 1993. para. 5(c) stipulated that the permanent status negotiations should guarantee "arrangements for peace and security of all States in the region, including those named in resolution 181(II) of 29 November 1947"</ref> The [[Free City of Danzig]] was a historical precedent for this solution; [[Free Territory of Trieste|Trieste]] was a contemporaneous city ruled by the UN. Jewish representatives accepted the partition plan, while representatives of the Palestinian Arabs and the Arab states rejected it, declaring it illegal.<ref name=WJ/>

On 14 May 1948, the Jewish community in Palestine issued the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel]]. Israel became a member of the United Nations the following year and has since been [[International recognition of Israel|recognised by most countries]].<ref>[[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 273]].</ref> The countries recognizing Israel did not recognize its sovereignty over Jerusalem generally, citing the UN resolutions which called for an international status for the city.<ref name=JQ2005>{{cite book|last=Quigley|first=John|title=The Case for Palestine: An International Law Perspective|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822335395|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaUvqHNd6m0C}}</ref> The United States and Guatemala have embassies in Jerusalem.

With the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel and the subsequent [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|invasion by surrounding Arab states]], the UN proposal for Jerusalem never materialised. The [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] left [[Jordan]] in control of the eastern parts of Jerusalem, while the [[West Jerusalem|western sector]] (with the exception of the [[Mount Scopus]] [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] in the east) was held by Israel.<ref name=TJQ>{{cite book |last1=Lapidoth |first1=Ruth |last2=Hirsch |first2=Moshe |title=The Jerusalem Question and Its Resolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e93JIwTBjHgC |year=1994 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |isbn=0-7923-2893-0}}</ref> Each side recognised the other's ''[[de facto]]'' control of their respective sectors.<ref name=TRC>{{cite book |last=Korman |first=Sharon |title=The Right of Conquest: The Acquisition of Territory by Force in International Law and Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueDO1dJyjrUC |year=1996 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=0-19-828007-6}}</ref> The Armistice Agreement, however, was considered internationally as having no legal effect on the continued validity of the provisions of the partition resolution for the internationalisation of Jerusalem.<ref name="Corpus Separatum">See:

Following the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, Israel declared that [[Israeli law]] would be applied to [[East Jerusalem]] and enlarged its eastern boundaries, approximately doubling its size. The action was deemed unlawful by other states who did not recognize it. It was condemned by the UN Security Council and General Assembly which described it as an annexation and a violation of the rights of the Palestinian population. In 1980, Israel passed the [[Jerusalem Law]], which declared that ''"Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel"''.<ref name= kbl>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic10_eng.htm "Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel (Unofficial translation)"].

On 29 November 1947 the UN General Assembly passed a resolution which, as part of its Partition Plan for Palestine, included the establishment of Jerusalem as a separate international entity under the auspices of the United Nations, a so-called ''[[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]]''.

===1948 war and 1949 diplomatic steps===
During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], 
Israel took control of [[West Jerusalem]] while [[Jordan]] took control of [[East Jerusalem]] (including the walled [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] in which most holy places are located).<ref name=TJQ/> Although accepting partition before the war, Israel rejected the UN's ''corpus separatum'' decision at the [[Lausanne Conference of 1949]], and instead indicated a preference for division of Jerusalem into Jewish and Arab zones, and international control and protection only for holy places and sites.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130705171032/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/2C25E1B7AADB7CC685256AF5005F6D18  ''Letter dated 31 May 1949, addressed by Mr. Walter Eytan, Head of the Delegation of Israel''] (doc.nr.

===Aftermath of 1967 Six-Day War===
After Israel conquered East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967 during the [[Six-Day War]], Israel argued that it had the stronger right to the city.<ref name=TJQ/>

Very soon after its conquest of East Jerusalem in 1967, Israel merged East Jerusalem with West Jerusalem by [[Reunification of Jerusalem|administratively extending the municipal boundary of the city]].

===1980 Jerusalem Law===
In July 1980, the [[Knesset]] passed the [[Jerusalem Law]] as part of the country's [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Law]], which declared Jerusalem the unified capital of Israel.<ref name="basiclaw">{{cite web |url= http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1980_1989/Basic%20Law-%20Jerusalem-%20Capital%20of%20Israel |publisher= Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |access-date=2 April 2007 |date=30 July 1980 |title= Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel}}</ref>

===Legal positions since Oslo Accords===
====On the 'corpus separatum' issue====
According to a 1999 statement by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], "There is no basis in international law for the position supporting a status of [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|'corpus separatum']] (separate entity) for the city of Jerusalem."<ref name="Jerusalem status">[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/3/The+Status+of+Jerusalem.htm The Status of Jerusalem].

''Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs''. 14 March 1999. Quote comes from §IV.</ref> In the view of the ministry, the concept of ''corpus separatum'' became irrelevant after the Arab states rejected the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] and [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|invaded the newly created State of Israel]] in 1948. Accordingly, the ministry states, "There has never been any agreement, treaty, or international understanding which applies the 'Corpus Separatum' concept to Jerusalem."<ref name="Jerusalem status"/>

====On sovereignty====
In 2003 Israel argued that Jordan had no rights to any land west of the Jordan River, that it had taken the West Bank and East Jerusalem by an act of aggression, and therefore never acquired sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |last= Einhorn |first= Talia |title= The Status of Palestine/Land of Israel and Its Settlement Under Public International Law |url= http://www.acpr.org.il/english-nativ/issue1/einhorn-1.htm |website= NATIV online, vol. 1 / 2003 |access-date=11 March 2018 |date= 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Disputed Territories – Forgotten Facts About the West Bank and Gaza Strip |url= http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFA-Archive/2003/Pages/DISPUTED%20TERRITORIES-%20Forgotten%20Facts%20About%20the%20We.aspx |website= mfa.gov.il |publisher= Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |access-date=11 March 2018 |date=1 February 2003}}</ref>

===Government positions since Oslo Accords===
Positions on the final status of Jerusalem have varied with different Israeli governments.

==== Yitzhak Rabin (Prime Minister 1992–95) ====
The [[Oslo Accords]] declared that the final status of Jerusalem would be negotiated, but Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] declared that he would never divide the city. In 1995, he told a group of school children{{dubious|And what did he tell his barber? Let's get real.|date=June 2019}} that "if they told us peace is the price of giving up a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty, my reply would be 'let's do without peace'".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jcpa.org/jcprg10.htm|title=Jerusalem History|website=www.jcpa.org|access-date=13 February 2020}}</ref>

====Benjamin Netanyahu (Prime Minister 1996–99)====
This position was upheld by his successor, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], who stated there would be “..no discussion of the case of Jerusalem...”.<ref>Hawas, Akram T. ''The new alliance: Turkey and Israel {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222112048/http://www.smi.uib.no/pao/hawas.html|date=22 February 2011}}''. The fourth Nordic conference on Middle Eastern Studies: The Middle East in globalizing world. Oslo, 13–16 August 1998.</ref>

==== Ehud Barak (Prime Minister 1999–2001) ====
Netanyahu's successor, [[Ehud Barak]], during negotiations, became the first Israeli Prime Minister to allow for a possible division of Jerusalem, despite his campaign promises.<ref>{{cite web |author= Dore Gold |author-link= Dore Gold |url= http://www.jcpa.org/jcprg10.htm |title= Jerusalem History |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] |access-date=6 December 2017}}</ref>

==== Ariel Sharon (Prime Minister 2001–06) ====
Prime minister during the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada|second intifada]], Ariel Sharon was unequivocal in his support for an undivided Jerusalem. In an interview done one week before a stroke incapacitated him he stated: “Our position is that Jerusalem is not negotiable. We are not going to negotiate on Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be forever a united and undivided capital of Israel.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3196291,00.html|title=Sharon's last interview before stroke|last=Bodoni|first=Ronen|date=1 June 2006|website=Ynetnews|language=en|access-date=13 February 2020}}</ref>

==== Ehud Olmert (Prime Minister 2006–09) ====
Prime Minister (and former Jerusalem mayor) [[Ehud Olmert]] vowed to keep Jerusalem the "undivided, eternal capital of the Jewish people",<ref>{{cite web |last1= Avishai |first1= Bernard |title= The Israel Peace Plan That Still Could Be |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/magazine/13Israel-t.html |website= The New York Times |access-date=11 March 2018 |date=7 February 2011}}</ref> but later supported the detachment of several Arab neighborhoods from Israeli sovereignty and the introduction of an international trust to run the [[Temple Mount]].

==== Benjamin Netanyahu (Prime Minister 2009–current) ====
When Netanyahu succeeded Olmert, he declared that "all of Jerusalem would always remain under Israeli sovereignty" and that only Israel would "ensure the freedom of religion and freedom of access for the three religions to the holy places".<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/netanyahu-jerusalem-holy-sites-will-remain-israeli-forever-1.276465  "Netanyahu: Jerusalem holy sites will remain Israeli forever"]. ''Haaretz''. 21 May 2009.</ref>

These statements seem to closely reflect Israeli public opinion. According to a 2012 poll by the right-wing [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], 78% of Jewish voters who responded said that they would reconsider voting for any politician that wants to relinquish Israel's control over the Old City and East Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite news |author= Karl Vick |url= http://world.time.com/2012/12/31/the-west-banks-2012-the-year-of-the-israeli-settlement/?iid=gs-main-lead | work= Time |title= The West Bank's 2012: The Year of the Israeli Settlement |date=31 December 2012}}</ref>

On 17 May 2015, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated, regarding Jerusalem serving as the capital of both Israel and a future Palestinian state, "Jerusalem has forever been the capital of only the Jewish people and no other nation."<ref>{{cite news |title= Israel's foreign relations: Contra mundum |url= https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21651865-israels-new-government-running-out-friends-abroad-contra-mundum |access-date=24 May 2015 |work=[[The Economist]] |date= 21 May 2015}}</ref>

On 2 January 2018 Israel passed into law new legislation that requires the two-thirds majority support of the Knesset for any section of Jerusalem to be transferred to a foreign government.<ref>{{cite news |title= In late night vote Knesset passes law to hinder East Jerusalem withdrawal |url= https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-late-night-vote-knesset-passes-law-to-hinder-east-jerusalem-withdrawal |newspaper= The Times of Osrael}}</ref>

On 25 January 2018, Netanyahu repeated the previous government position but seemed to alter it, reportedly saying: "Under any peace agreement the capital of Israel will continue to be ''in'' Jerusalem." (stress added)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Benjamin-Netanyahu/WATCH-LIVE-Prime-Minister-Netanyahu-speaks-at-the-World-Economic-Forum-539789|title=Netanyahu at Davos: Jerusalem to remain capital under any peace agreement|work=Jerusalem Post|date=25 January 2018}}</ref>

==Palestine==
{{see also|Israel – Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition|Thawabit}}
During the British Mandate, the main representation of the Palestinian Arabs was the [[Arab Higher Committee]], formed in the beginning of the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab revolt]] in 1936; it was outlawed in 1937 and its leaders deported. Reconstituted in 1945 and dominated by Palestinian Arabs, it continued in various iterations until 1948, when, viewed as a threat to Jordan, [[Army of the Holy War|its army]] was forced to disband. There was unequivocal support for an Arab controlled Jerusalem (at that time the status quo).

Until the establishment of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) in 1964, there was little in terms of an internationally recognised representation of the Palestinian Arabs. The Arab League usually took over the job, with the short-lived Egyptian-controlled [[All-Palestine Government]] based in Gaza having little sway, and [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordan taking control of the West Bank with East Jerusalem]].

Until the Oslo Accords in 1993, and the [[Israel – Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition|Letters of Mutual Recognition]], the Palestinians,{{dubious|There is no such thing as "the Palestinians" in terms of a unified national will.|date=June 2019}} represented since 1964 by the PLO, had at all times rejected any partition of any part of the former British Mandate territory.

Despite recognition of Israel (only from Fatah, not Hamas), and its support in 1949 of ''corpus separatum'', it had never conceded sovereignty of Jerusalem. In 1988, Jordan conceded all claims to the West Bank, including Jerusalem, other than the [[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|Muslim holy places on the Temple Mount]], and recognized the PLO as the legal representatives of the Palestinian people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_periods9.html|title=Jordan - History - Disengagement from the West Bank|website=www.kinghussein.gov.jo|access-date=13 February 2020}}</ref>

The [[Palestinian National Authority]] views East Jerusalem as occupied Palestinian territory, in line with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|UNSC Resolution 242]]. The PNA claims all of East Jerusalem, including the [[Temple Mount]], as the capital of the [[State of Palestine]], and claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to final status negotiations, but is willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an [[open city]]. In the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]'s [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]] of 1988, Jerusalem is called the capital of the [[State of Palestine]]. In 2000 the [[Palestinian Authority]] passed a law designating the city as such, and in 2002 this law was ratified by Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]].<ref name=PalestinianPosition>[http://english.people.com.cn/200210/06/eng20021006_104530.shtml "Arafat Signs Law Making Jerusalem Palestinian Capital"], ''People's Daily'', published 6 October 2002; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2302961.stm "Arafat names Jerusalem as capital"], ''BBC News'', published 6 October 2002.</ref> The official position of the PNA is that Jerusalem should be an open city, with no physical partition and that Palestine would guarantee freedom of worship, access and the protection of sites of religious significance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minfo.gov.ps/permenant/English/Jerusalem/Pal_Official.htm |title=The Palestinian Official Position |access-date=10 February 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212195415/http://www.minfo.gov.ps/permenant/English/Jerusalem/Pal_Official.htm |archive-date=12 February 2006 |publisher=Palestinian National Authority, Ministry of Information}}</ref> The status quo on the Temple Mount now is that tourists are allowed to visit, but not pray, on the Temple Mount, although this seems to be slowly changing.

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] does not recognize Israel's proclamation of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, which is, for example, reflected in the wording of General Assembly Resolution 63/30 of 2009 which states that "any actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem are illegal and therefore null and void and have no validity whatsoever, and calls upon Israel to cease all such illegal and unilateral measures."<ref name="GA63/30">{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/unga63_30.pdf?OpenElement|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly – 63/30.

Although the General Assembly cannot pass legally binding resolutions over international issues, the [[United Nations Security Council]], which has the authority to do so, has passed a total of six Security Council [[List of UN resolutions concerning Israel|resolutions on Israel]] on the matter, including [[UN Security Council Resolution 478|UNSC resolution 478]] which affirmed that the enactment of the 1980 [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic]] [[Jerusalem Law]] declaring unified Jerusalem as Israel's "eternal and indivisible" capital, was a violation of international law. The resolution advised member states to withdraw their diplomatic representation from the city. The Security Council, as well as the UN in general, has consistently affirmed the position that East Jerusalem (but not west Jerusalem) is occupied Palestinian territory subject to the provisions of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]. The [[International Court of Justice]] in its 2004 Advisory opinion on the "Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory" described East Jerusalem as "occupied Palestinian territory".<ref name="RL2008"/>

After Israel passed the [[Jerusalem Law]] in 1980, the UN Security Council adopted [[UN Security Council Resolution 478|Resolution 478]], which called upon UN member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from the city. Thirteen countries—[[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Panama]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]]—moved their embassies from Jerusalem primarily to [[Tel Aviv]].

Various countries recognized Israel as a state in the 1940s and 1950s, without recognizing Israeli sovereignty over West Jerusalem. There is an international ''[[Sui generis#Legal applications|sui generis]]'' consular corps in Jerusalem. It is commonly referred to as the "Consular Corps of the Corpus Separatum". The states that have maintained consulates in Jerusalem say that it was part of Mandate Palestine, and in a ''de jure'' sense has not since become part of any other sovereignty.<ref name="Corpus Separatum"/> The Netherlands maintains an office in Jerusalem serving mainly Israeli citizens. Other foreign governments base consulate general offices in Jerusalem, including [[Greece]], [[Spain]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[United States]] had a consulate general in Jerusalem, which was reclassified as its embassy in 2018.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Since the [[President of Israel]] resides in Jerusalem and confirms the foreign diplomats, the ambassadors have to travel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to submit letters of credentials upon being appointed. 

The United States relocated its embassy to Israel to Jerusalem in 2018, as did Guatemala. A number of countries have indicated that they could relocate their embassies to Jerusalem, including Honduras, Brazil, Serbia, the Czech Republic and the Dominican Republic. Kosovo, which does not have an embassy in Israel has spoken of opening one in Jerusalem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/dominican-republic-to-weigh-relocating-embassy-to-jerusalem-647593|title=Dominican Republic to weigh relocating embassy to Jerusalem|website=The Jerusalem Post &#124; JPost.com}}</ref> In December 2020, the [[Czech Republic]] indicated that in 2021 it will open a Jerusalem branch office of the Czech Embassy in Tel Aviv.

* {{flag|Vatican}}: The [[Holy See|Vatican]] has had a long-held position on Jerusalem and its concern for the protection of the Christian [[holy places]] in the Holy Land which predates the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestinian Mandate]]. The Vatican's historic claims and interests, as well as those of Italy and France were based on the former [[Protectorate of the Holy See]] and the [[French Protectorate of Jerusalem]], which were incorporated in article 95 of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (1920), which incorporated the [[Balfour Declaration]], but also provided: "it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine". The Balfour Declaration and the proviso were also incorporated in the Palestinian Mandate (1923), but which also provided in articles 13 and 14 for an international commission to resolve competing claims on the holy places. These claimants had officially lost all capitulation rights by article 28 of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923). However, Britain never gave any effect to Mandate provisions arts 13 & 14. During the drafting of proposals that culminated in the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] (also known as Resolution 181) in 1947, the historic claims of the Vatican, Italy and France were revived, and expressed as the call for the special international regime for the city of Jerusalem. This was also confirmed in [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|UN General Assembly Resolution 194]] in 1948, which maintained the position that Jerusalem be made an international city,<ref>{{cite web |first=Gregory|last=Kane |title=Hearing the Sounds of Silence at Middle East Conference |work=[[Virginia Gazette]] |date=28 November 2007 |url=http://www.vagazette.com/bal-md.kane28nov28,0,6834786.column |access-date=27 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120190458/http://www.vagazette.com/bal-md.kane28nov28,0,6834786.column |archive-date=20 November 2008  }}</ref> under United Nations supervision. The Vatican's official position on the status of Jerusalem was in favour of an [[internationalization of Jerusalem]], in order to keep the holy place away from either Israeli or Arab sovereignty. <br/>Pope [[Pius XII]] supported this idea in the 1949 encyclical ''[[Redemptoris nostri cruciatus]]''. It was proposed again during the papacies of [[John XXIII]], [[Paul VI]], [[John Paul II]] and [[Benedict XVI]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/vatican-hails-un-palestine-vote-1.5266588|title=Vatican Hails UN Palestine Vote, Wants Guarantees for Jerusalem|date=30 November 2012|via=Haaretz}}</ref> The Vatican reiterated this position in 2012, recognizing Jerusalem's "identity and sacred character" and calling for freedom of access to the city's holy places to be protected by "an internationally guaranteed special statute". After the US recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017, [[Pope Francis]] repeated the Vatican's position: "I wish to make a heartfelt appeal to ensure that everyone is committed to respecting the status quo of the city, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations."<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Horowitz| first = Jason| title = U.N., European Union and Pope Criticize Trump's Jerusalem Announcement| work = The New York Times| access-date = 10 December 2017| date = 6 December 2017| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/europe/trump-jerusalem-pope.html}}</ref>

==Islamic holy sites==
The status of Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem, including Haram Al-Sharif/Temple Mount, is also unresolved. In 1924, the [[Supreme Muslim Council]], the highest Muslim body in charge of Muslim community affairs in Mandatory Palestine, accepted [[Hussein bin Ali]] ([[Sharif of Mecca]]) as custodian of [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].

In the 1994 peace treaty with Jordan, Israel committed to “respect the present special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem.” Israel also pledged that when negotiations on the permanent status will take place, it will give high priority to the Jordanian historical role in these shrines. The [[Wakf]] Department that oversees Muslim sites in Jerusalem is controlled by the Jordanian government, which insists on its exclusive custodianship of the holy site. In 2013, the Palestinian Authority also recognized Jordan’s role through an agreement signed between PA President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] and [[King Abdullah II]].<ref> [https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/jordan-fears-losing-control-over-muslim-sites-in-jerusalem-651125 Jordan fears losing control over Muslim sites in Jerusalem ]</ref>

==French claims in Jerusalem==
{{see also|Fischer-Chauvel Agreement}}
There are four sites in Jerusalem claimed by [[France]] as "''[[:fr:Domaine national|Domaine national français]]''", which are based on claimed French acquisitions predating the formation of the State of Israel:

* [[Church of the Pater Noster]], also known as the Sanctuary of the Eleona
* [[Benedictine monastery in Abu Ghosh]]
* [[Tombs of the Kings (Jerusalem)|Tombs of the Kings]]
* [[Church of Saint Anne, Jerusalem|Church of Saint Anne]].

French presidents have claimed that the [[Church of Saint Anne, Jerusalem|Church of Saint Anne in Jerusalem]] come under French protection, owned by its government, and is French territory.<ref>[https://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/French-President-Macron-confronts-police-in-Jerusalems-Old-City-614989 French President Macron orders Israeli police out of French church]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=VIDEO.
