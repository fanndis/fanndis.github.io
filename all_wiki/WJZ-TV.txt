'''WJZ-TV''', [[virtual channel]] 13 ([[very high frequency|VHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 11), is a [[CBS]] [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], United States. The station is owned by the [[CBS Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[ViacomCBS]]. WJZ-TV's studios and offices are located on Television Hill in the [[Woodberry, Baltimore|Woodberry]] section of Baltimore, adjacent to the transmission tower it shares with several other Baltimore broadcast outlets.

On cable, the station is available on [[Xfinity|Comcast Xfinity]] channel 23. On [[Verizon FiOS]], [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] and in most outlying areas of the [[media market|market]], it is carried on channel 13.

==History==

===Early history===
Baltimore's third television station first started on November 1, 1948 as '''WAAM'''. The station was originally owned by '''Radio-Television of Baltimore Inc.''', whose principals were Baltimore businessmen and brothers, Ben and Herman Cohen.<ref name="Cohen94">{{cite news|author=David Michael Ettlin |display-authors=etal |title=Ben Cohen dies, co-owned Pimlico|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-03-23/news/1994082035_1_ben-cohen-pimlico-older-brother|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=23 March 1994}}</ref><ref name="MountNoll">{{cite book|last=Noel|first=Linda|title=Around Mount Washington|page=93|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|date=2013|isbn=9781467120425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cR35AAAAQBAJ&q=waam+13+originally+operated+by+brothers+ben+%26+herman+cohen&pg=PA93}}</ref> Channel 13 was originally an ABC affiliate, the network's fifth outlet to be located on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].<ref name="DuMont13">{{cite web|title=WAAM Baltimore signs as ABC video affiliate. |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/48-OCR/1948-07-12-BC-OCR-Page-0048.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting – Telecasting |page=48 |date=July 12, 1948}}</ref> Until 1956, it carried an additional primary affiliation with the [[DuMont Television Network]]. On the station's second day of operations, WAAM broadcast the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 presidential election returns]] and various entertainment shows, remaining on the air for 23 consecutive hours.<ref name="WAAMElection">{{cite web|title=WAAM's big day; new TV outlet was on air 23 hours Nov. 2–3. |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/48-OCR/1948-11-15-BC-OCR-Page-0098.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting – Telecasting |page=98 |date=November 15, 1948}}</ref> Channel 13 has been housed in the same studio facility, located near [[Druid Hill Park]] on what was then known as Malden Hill (now known as Television Hill), since the station's inception; the building was the first in Baltimore specifically designed for television production and broadcasting. As a DuMont affiliate, WAAM originated many [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] games for the network's [[NFL on DuMont|National Football League coverage]].<ref>http://www.dumonthistory.tv/3.html</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dumonthistory.tv/a9.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214213720/http://dumonthistory.tv/a9.html |archive-date=2009-02-14 }}</ref>

The [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] purchased WAAM from the Cohen brothers in May 1957.<ref>{{cite web|title=WBC's WAAM (TV) buy: $4.4 million. |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/57-OCR/1957-05-13-BC-OCR-Page-0098.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting – Telecasting |page=112 |date=May 13, 1957}}</ref> Westinghouse then took control of the station in August of that year, and changed its callsign to '''WJZ-TV''' the following month. The WJZ call letters had previously resided on ABC's flagship radio/television combination in [[New York City]], which changed its calls to [[WABC (AM)|WABC-AM]]-[[WPLJ|FM]]-[[WABC-TV|TV]] in 1953.<ref>{{cite web|title=WAAM (TV) becomes WJZ-TV as FCC waives call rule. |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/57-OCR/1957-08-05-BC-OCR-Page-0092.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting – Telecasting |page=92 |date=August 5, 1957}}</ref> However, Westinghouse's history with that set of call letters went back even further, as it was the original owner of WJZ radio, the flagship station of NBC's [[NBC Blue Network|Blue Network]], which would eventually become ABC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stations (continued, top of page). |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/57-OCR/1957-08-12-BC-OCR-Page-0094.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting – Telecasting |page=94 |date=August 12, 1957}}</ref>

All of Baltimore's television stations at the time had fairly short transmission towers in the medium's early years; channel 13's original tower was located next to the station's studios. In 1959, the three stations—WJZ-TV, [[WBAL-TV]] (channel 11) and [[WMAR-TV]] (channel 2)—formed a [[joint venture]] to build the world's first three-pronged [[candelabra tower]].<ref name="Towerpower">{{cite web|last=Rasmussen|first=Fred|title=A Tower of Power Rose Up Above City Structure|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=21 September 1997|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-09-21/features/1997264146_1_tower-of-power-transmission-tower-barnard}}</ref> Constructed behind the WJZ-TV studios and opposite the original channel 13 tower, it was the tallest free standing television antenna in the United States at the time of its completion. The new tower significantly improved channel 13's signal coverage in central Maryland, and also added new viewers in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]],<ref name="Towerpower"/> [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Virginia]].<ref>[http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/AsrSearch/asrRegistration.jsp?regKey=600292]</ref>

[[File:Wjztv07.JPG|thumb|200px|The WJZ-TV studio and office facility, on Television Hill in Baltimore.]]

===Later ABC years===
WJZ-TV nearly lost its ABC affiliation in 1977, when the network briefly pursued WBAL-TV just as ABC became the most-watched broadcast network (in prime time) in the United States for the first time. However, WBAL-TV declined the ABC affiliation offer due to ABC's last-place network evening newscast offerings of the time (a situation that would improve in ensuing years), keeping ABC on channel 13.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1977/BC-1977-03-21.pdf "In brief." ''Broadcasting'', March 21, 1977, pg. 30]</ref><ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1977/BC-1977-03-28.pdf "In brief." ''Broadcasting'', March 28, 1977, pg. 34]</ref>

===Switch to CBS===
{{further|1994–1996 United States broadcast television realignment}}
In June 1994, ABC agreed to an affiliation deal with the broadcasting division of the [[E. W. Scripps Company]], which resulted in three of Scripps' television stations—WMAR-TV in Baltimore, [[WFTS-TV]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[KNXV-TV]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]—becoming ABC affiliates. ABC agreed to the deal as a condition of keeping its affiliation on Scripps' two biggest stations, [[WXYZ-TV]] in [[Detroit]] and [[WEWS]] in [[Cleveland]]. Both stations had been heavily courted by CBS, which was about to lose two of its longtime affiliates—[[WJBK]] and [[WJW (TV)|WJW]]—to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. ABC was reluctant to include WMAR, then an NBC affiliate, in the deal; it had been a ratings also-ran for over 30 years while WJZ-TV was one of the strongest ABC affiliates in the nation. However, not wanting to be relegated to UHF in two markets with few viable choices for a new affiliate, ABC opted to end its 46-year affiliation with channel 13 and move its affiliation to channel 2.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zurawik|first=David|title=ABC-TV to Switch from WJZ to WMAR|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-06-17/news/1994168105_1_wmar-scripps-affiliates|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=June 17, 1994|accessdate=September 8, 2018}}</ref>

Group W felt betrayed by ABC after so many years of loyalty, as channel 13 had been ABC's longest-tenured affiliate at the time (a distinction that now belongs to WJLA-TV). As a safeguard, it began to shop for an affiliation deal of its own. One month later, Westinghouse agreed to a long-term affiliation contract with CBS, resulting in WJZ-TV and its sister stations in [[KYW-TV|Philadelphia]] and [[WBZ-TV|Boston]] switching to CBS (Westinghouse's two other television stations, in [[KDKA-TV|Pittsburgh]] and [[KPIX-TV|San Francisco]], were already CBS affiliates).<ref>{{cite news|last=Wollenberg|first=Skip|title=CBS, Westinghouse Agree on Broad TV Station Partnership|url=https://www.apnews.com/1d51b34c4bc24b7cff7273bd81e8cda3|work=AP|date=15 July 1994}}</ref> The affiliation switch, the second in Baltimore television history, occurred early on the morning of January 2, 1995.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zurawik|first=David|title=Get ready, get set, get confused, in TV's big switch in Baltimore Changing Channels|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-01-01/features/1995001132_1_wbal-wjz-viewers|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=1 January 1995}}</ref> The last ABC prime time program to air on channel 13 was the [[television film|made-for-TV movie]] ''[[A Dangerous Affair]]'', which was broadcast at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on January 1,<ref>{{cite news |title=Sunday Prime Time |work=[[Baltimore Sun]] Statewide TV |page=7 |date=January 1, 1995 }}</ref> and the final overall ABC program to air on channel 13 was the January 2 edition of ''[[ABC World News Now]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sunday Night Owl |work=[[Baltimore Sun]] Statewide TV |page=9 |date=January 1, 1995 }}</ref> As a result, channel 13 became the third station in Baltimore to affiliate with CBS. The network had originally affiliated with WMAR-TV in 1948 before moving to WBAL-TV in 1981. Westinghouse then bought CBS on November 24, 1995, making WJZ-TV a CBS [[owned-and-operated station]]. Notably, this marked the first time that CBS had wholly owned a station in the Baltimore/Washington corridor; it had been minority owner of WTOP-TV in Washington (now [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]]) from 1950 to 1955.

WJZ-TV has used its current stylized "13" logo, using a font face exclusive to Group W, since 1967. In 2002, the [[CBS#Logos|CBS eye]] was added, and in 2018, the station switched to a silver and gold-colored version (resembling logo styles used by its sister stations) with the WJZ call letters displayed below in squares.

On February 2, 2017, [[CBS Radio]] agreed to merge with [[Entercom]], which effectively separated WJZ-TV from WJZ radio.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WJZ-TV shut down its analog signal, over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 13, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 38 to VHF channel 13 for post-transition operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |title=DTV Tentative Channel Designations for the First and the Second Rounds |accessdate=2012-03-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829004251/http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |archive-date=2013-08-29 }}</ref><ref name="FCCForm387">[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101234236&formid=387&fac_num=25455 CDBS Print<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="Form 387 Attachment">http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getattachment_exh.cgi?exhibit_id=616897</ref> WMAR-TV took over the channel 38 allocation as it moved its digital signal from channel 52 as a result of the phaseout of channels 52–69.

The switch caused problems for some viewers due to reception issues related to the transition, but the [[Federal Communications Commission]] granted WJZ-TV a power increase that helps some people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/fixing-vhf-dtv-reception-problems |title=Fixing VHF DTV Reception Problems |work=TV Technology |date=19 June 2009}}</ref>

===Spectrum repacking===
As a part of the [[Spectrum reallocation#Repacking|repacking]] process following the [[Spectrum reallocation#Broadcast incentive auction|2016–2017 FCC incentive auction]], WJZ-TV relocated to VHF channel 11 on July 3, 2020, using [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]] to display its [[virtual channel]] number as 13.<ref>http://www.nab.org/repacking/clearinghouse.asp</ref> WBAL-TV concurrently moved to channel 12.

==Programming==
WJZ-TV is the Baltimore area affiliate of the ''[[It's Academic]]'' high school [[quiz bowl|quiz competition]] which originated in Washington since it expanded to the area in 1971.

Over the years, WJZ-TV frequently preempted ABC programming in favor of locally produced programs and syndicated content from Westinghouse's broadcasting division, [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]], such as ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' and the original version of ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]''; notably, the former ABC daytime [[soap opera]] ''[[Dark Shadows]]'' was preempted during the mid-1960s. However, ABC was more than satisfied with channel 13, which was one of its strongest affiliates. Additionally, Baltimore viewers could watch ABC programs on Washington's [[WJLA-TV|WMAL-TV/WJLA-TV]] (channel 7), whose signal decently covers most of the Baltimore area.

From 1957 to 1964, one of the station's highest-rated programs was ''[[The Buddy Deane Show]]'', an in-studio teen dance show similar to ABC's ''[[American Bandstand]]'', which WJZ-TV also preempted in favor of the Deane program. Deane's program was the inspiration for the [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] 1988 motion picture ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' and its subsequent [[Hairspray (musical)|Broadway musical version]], which in turn has been made into a [[Hairspray (2007 film)|film]].

Since becoming a CBS affiliate, WJZ-TV has carried the network's lineup in pattern with virtually no preemptions except for breaking news emergencies and [[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]] baseball games, as per an agreement between Group W and CBS. Prior to September 2019, WJZ-TV has aired the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' on a [[Broadcast delay|half-hour tape delay]], due to an hour-long 6 p.m. newscast. Current [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming carried on this station includes ''[[Maury (talk show)|Maury]]'', ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''. WJZ-TV is the only CBS O&O station in the nation to carry the former show. The latter two shows are distributed by CBS' corporate cousin, [[CBS Television Distribution]].

===Sports programming===
WJZ-TV has been the ''de facto'' broadcaster for the [[Baltimore Ravens]] of the [[National Football League]], airing a majority of the team's contests since [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] acquired rights to the [[American Football Conference]] in 1998, including their [[Super Bowl XXXV]] and [[Super Bowl XLVII|XLVII]] appearances, both victories, at the end of the [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|2000]] and [[2012 Baltimore Ravens season|2012]] seasons.

Channel 13 has also served two stints as the television home of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team, from [[1954 Baltimore Orioles season|1954]] to [[1978 Baltimore Orioles season|1978]] and from [[1994 Baltimore Orioles season|1994]] until [[2017 Baltimore Orioles season|2017]]. It was one of the few "[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]]" stations to air baseball on a regular basis. As an ABC affiliate, WJZ-TV also broadcast select Orioles games via [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC's MLB broadcast contract]] from 1976 to 1989, including their victory in the [[1983 World Series]].

==News operation==
[[File:Wjz live shot.JPG|225px|thumb|right|Two former WJZ anchors Don Scott and Jessica Kartalija preparing for a live-shot during the funeral of former [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] [[William Donald Schaefer]], April 28, 2011.]]
WJZ-TV presently broadcasts 38 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours, 35 minutes each weekday and three hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). Like other CBS-owned stations, channel 13 offers a web-only newscast, ''WJZ At Your Desk'', which is produced each weekday.

Soon after Westinghouse bought WJZ-TV, it significantly beefed up the station's news department. On October 12, 1957, WJZ-TV cameraman John Kelly filmed a motion picture of the final stage of [[Sputnik 1]]'s rocket crossing the pre-dawn sky of Baltimore, featured in a half-hour special program on Sputnik, broadcast that evening by Westinghouse sister station WBZ-TV in Boston.<ref>{{cite news|last=Molczan|first=T.|title=Motion Picture of Sputnik 1 Rocket from Baltimore on October 12, 1957|url=http://www.satobs.org/sputnik1rocketbaltimore.html|work=satobs.org|date=June 30, 2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref> Within a few years, it passed WMAR-TV for second place. Like the other Group W stations, WJZ-TV adopted the ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' format pioneered at Philadelphia sister station KYW-TV. By the early 1970s, WJZ-TV had passed WBAL-TV for first place—a lead it held for over 30 years. Around 2001, however, WBAL-TV passed WJZ-TV for first place in all evening timeslots, though WJZ-TV still placed a strong second. However, in the official November 2009 [[Nielsen ratings]] sweeps period, the first since the debut of ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' (which aired on WBAL-TV), WJZ-TV returned to a dominant position at 11 p.m. for the first time since the early 2000s. Both stations spent the next two years in a virtual dead heat in the late news. However, since the November 2011 Nielsen sweeps period, WJZ has dominated over WBAL in all news time slots in both total households and the critical 25–54 demographic; however, WBAL remains a strong second. It has been one of CBS's strongest O&Os ever since the 1995 affiliation switch.

WJZ-TV was the first station in Baltimore to hire a full-time consumer reporter, as well as the first station to organize an investigative reporting team. In 1965, shortly after it adopted the ''Eyewitness News'' format, Wiley Daniels became the first [[African-American]] anchor in Baltimore. He worked alongside [[Jerry Turner (anchorman)|Jerry Turner]], one of the most popular anchormen in Baltimore television history. [[Al Sanders]] succeeded Daniels in 1977; he and Turner were the top news team until Turner succumbed to [[esophageal cancer]]. Denise Koch succeeded Turner upon his death in 1987; she remains at the anchor desk alongside Vic Carter, who succeeded Sanders following the latter's death in 1995.

In 1976, [[Oprah Winfrey]] became an anchor for the station's 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. She also co-hosted channel 13's local talk show, ''People Are Talking'' with [[Richard Sher (newscaster)|Richard Sher]], which premiered on August 14, 1978, until she left for [[Chicago]] in 1983.

Since September 2008, ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' has had a news partnership with WJZ-TV; involving sharing content, story leads, and cooperating together on stories. Channel 13 promotes stories featured in the ''Sun'' on its news broadcasts. The ''Sun'' promotes WJZ's stories and weather team on its pages. Coincidentally, ''The Baltimore Sun'' was the founder and original owner of rival WMAR-TV from 1947 to 1986.

On October 25, 2009, WJZ-TV became the third Baltimore station to begin airing newscasts in [[High-definition television|high definition]]. For several months after the upgrade, field reports were still presented in [[4:3]] [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] until it switched over to the [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] format. As of September 2011, all of WJZ-TV's locally produced video footage, including remote field reports, are in HD, making it the first station in Baltimore to do so.

During the noon newscast on August 9, 2018, WJZ-TV unveiled a new set, and introduced the same on-air graphics scheme used by other CBS owned-and-operated stations (the last among the group to do so).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/z-on-tv-blog/bs-fe-zontv-wjz-new-anchorwoman-20180808-story.html|title=New anchorwoman, set, graphics debut at WJZ-TV today and tomorrow|last=Zurawik|first=David|work=Baltimore Sun|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}</ref> On August 20, 2018, WJZ-TV expanded its morning newscasts from 5–7 a.m. to 4:30–7 a.m., becoming the last station in Baltimore to start their morning newscasts at 4:30&nbsp;a.m. On September 9, 2019, WJZ debuted a 7 p.m. newscast for the first time, and the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' was moved to 6:30&nbsp;p.m.
