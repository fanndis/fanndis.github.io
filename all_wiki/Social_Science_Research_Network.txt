The '''SSRN''', formerly known as '''Social Science Research Network''', is a [[Institutional repository|repository]] for [[preprints]] devoted to the rapid dissemination of scholarly research in the social sciences and humanities and more. [[Elsevier]] bought SSRN from Social Science Electronic Publishing Inc. in May 2016.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/ssrn-the-leading-social-science-and-humanities-repository-and-online-community-joins-elsevier|title=SSRN — a leading social science and humanities repository and online community — joins Elsevier|website=www.elsevier.com|access-date=17 May 2016}}</ref>

==History==
SSRN was founded in 1994 by [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] and Wayne Marr, both [[financial economics|financial economists]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rbj.net/2016/06/03/dutch-company-acquires-firm-in-brighton/|title=Dutch company acquires firm in Brighton|last=Feltner|first=Kerry|date=2016-06-03|website=Rochester Business Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>

In January 2013, SSRN was ranked the biggest open-access repository in the world by Ranking Web of Repositories (an initiative of the [[Cybermetrics Lab]], a research group belonging to the [[Spanish National Research Council]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/world|title=World|date=January 2013|publisher=Cybermetrics Lab|work=Ranking Web of Repositories|access-date=11 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629031236/http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/world|archive-date=2013-06-29}}</ref> measured by number of PDF files, backlinks and Google Scholar results.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/Methodology|title=Methodology|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701033427/http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/Methodology|archive-date=2013-07-01}}</ref>

In May 2016,  SSRN was bought from Social Science Electronic Publishing Inc. by [[Elsevier]].<ref name=":0" /> On 17 May 2016, the SSRN founder and chairman [[Michael C. Jensen]] wrote a letter to the SSRN community in which he cited Gordon's post on the [https://www.elsevier.com/connect/ssrn-the-leading-social-science-and-humanities-repository-and-online-community-joins-elsevier Elsevier Connect] and the "new opportunities" coming from the fusion<ref name="SSRN in Elsevier">{{cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/ssrn-the-,leading-social-science-and-humanities-repository-and-online-community-joins-elsevier|title=Photo|trans-title=SSRN—the leading social science and humanities repository and online community—joins Elsevier|author= Gregg Gordon|date =May 17, 2016}}</ref>, such as a broader global network and the freedom "to upload and download papers" (with  more data, more resources, as well as new management tools). While predicting "some conflicts" on the interests alignment of the former competitors, he defined them as "surmountable".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/ssrn-joins-mendeley-elsevier/|title=From The Desk of Michael C.

In July 2016 there were reports of papers being removed from SSRN without notice; revision comments from SSRN indicated this was due to copyright concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160718/02211935003/just-as-open-competitor-to-elseviers-ssrn-launches-ssrn-accused-copyright-crackdown.shtml|title=Just As Open Competitor To Elsevier's SSRN Launches, SSRN Accused Of Copyright Crackdown|website=Techdirt|last=Masnick|first=Mike|access-date=6 August 2016}}</ref> SSRN CEO Gregg Gordon characterized the issue as a mistake affecting about 20 papers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/07/19/social-science-research-network-confusion-leads-calls-boycott|title=There Isn't Some Big Conspiracy Happening|website=Inside Higher Ed|last=Straumsheim|first=Carl|access-date=6 August 2016}}</ref>

==Operations==
Academic papers in PDF format can be uploaded directly to the SSRN site by authors and are then available around the world via download. Users can also subscribe to abstracting emails covering a broad range of research areas and topic specialties. These distributing emails contain abstracts (with links to the full text where applicable) of papers recently submitted to SSRN in the respective field.

SSRN, like other preprint services, circulates publications throughout the scholarly community at an early stage, permitting the author to incorporate comments into the final version of the paper before its publication in a journal. Moreover, even if access to the published paper is restricted, access to the original working paper remains open through SSRN, so long as the author decides to keep the paper up.  Often authors take papers down at the request of publishers, particularly if they are published by commercial or university presses that depend on payment for paper copies or online access.

Academic papers in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format can be uploaded directly to the SSRN site by authors and may then be available for downloading.<ref>https://support.ssrn.com/knowledgebase.php?article=67</ref> As of 2019, download by users is generally subject to registration or completion of a [[ReCAPTCHA]] challenge.

Publishers and institutions can upload papers and charge a fee for readers to download them.<ref name="About_SSRN">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssrn.com/update/general/mjensen.html|title=About SSRN|first=Michael C.|last=Jensen|author-link=Michael C. Jensen|date=2 February 2012|work=Social Science Research Network|publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc.|access-date=30 December 2013}}</ref> Users can also subscribe to abstracting [[email]] journals covering a broad range of subject matters. These e-journals then periodically distribute emails containing abstracts (with links to the full text where applicable) of papers recently submitted to SSRN in the respective field.

On SSRN, authors and papers are ranked by their number of downloads, which has become an informal indicator of popularity on prepress and [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] sites.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Black|first1=Bernard S.|last2=Caron|first2=Paul|title=Ranking Law Schools: Using SSRN to Measure Scholarly Performance|ssrn=784764|id=U of Texas law, Law and Econ Research Paper No. 52; U of Cincinnati Public Law Research Paper No. 05-14|journal=Indiana Law Journal|issue=Symposium on The Next Generation of Law School Rankings|volume=81|year=2006}}</ref>
