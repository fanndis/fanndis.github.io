'''Kathy Shelton''' (born 1962) is an [[United States|American]] [[sexual assault]] survivor. One of the defendants in her 1975 case was represented by  [[Hillary Clinton]] (then Rodham), which caused controversy when Clinton stood as the Democratic Party candidate in the 2016 US presidential election.

==Early life==
Shelton was raised by a single mother in [[Springdale, Arkansas]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

==1975 attack and trial==
In 1975, at age 12, Shelton alleged she was raped by two men in [[Arkansas]].<ref name="krauss_062614">{{cite web|last1=Krauss|first1=Michael I.|title=Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Ethics of a Rape Defense|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelkrauss/2014/06/26/hillary-rodham-clinton-and-the-ethics-of-a-rape-defense/#538a81c8c9be|work=Forbes|accessdate=15 October 2016|date=June 26, 2014}}</ref> 

One of the men accused of raping Shelton was 
41-year-old [[defendant]] Thomas Alfred Taylor whose court-appointed [[criminal defense lawyer]] was 27-year-old Hillary Rodham in her first-time appearance as courtroom litigator.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/19/did-clinton-laugh-about-a-rapists-light-sentence-and-attack-sexual-harassment-victims/|title=Did Clinton laugh about a rapist's light sentence and attack sexual harassment victims?|last=|first=|date=2016|work=The Washington Post|access-date=}}</ref> In her autobiography, Clinton said she was reluctant to take the case and asked to be let off the case; her account was later confirmed by the prosecutor in the case.<ref name=":0" /> At the time, she was working at the legal aid clinic at the [[University of Arkansas]] and represented the defendant for free.<ref name="merica_062514">{{cite web|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/25/prosecutor-in-controversial-case-says-clinton-had-no-choice-but-to-defend-rapist/|title=Prosecutor in controversial case says Clinton had no choice but to defend rapist|last1=Merica|first1=Dan|date=June 25, 2014|publisher=CNN|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> 

Taylor pleaded guilty to unlawful fondling of a minor under the age of 14.<ref name=":0" /> Based on court documents obtained by CNN and Clinton's account in her 2003 memoir ''Living History'', Clinton won a plea deal for Taylor, securing a significantly reduced charge and sentence, based on the prosecution's loss of critical pieces of evidence.<ref name="merica_062514" />

===Audio recordings===
Mid-1980s taped interviews with Clinton by Roy Reed, a reporter for ''Esquire'', were released in 2014 after being found in the archives of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.<ref name="NPR" >{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/11/03/500480069/the-story-behind-a-campaign-line-did-clinton-laugh-at-a-rape-victim|title=The Story Behind A Campaign Line: Did Clinton Laugh At A Rape Victim?|work=NPR|date=2014|accessdate=21 May 2019}}</ref> Reed said "She was laughing at the vagaries of the legal system that play out every day across America in one way or another."<ref name="NPR" /> At one point, she laughed in the interview while recounting that Taylor passed a [[polygraph]] test, which she said "forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs."<ref name=":0" />

==Reception==
After Shelton became aware that Clinton had been the criminal defense lawyer of the defendant in her case decades earlier, Shelton stated in 2007 that she herself bore no ill will toward Clinton for having had to act as her assailant's court-appointed criminal defence lawyer in the rape case, saying "I have to understand that she was representing Taylor ... Hillary was just doing her job."<ref name="Kessler">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/10/11/the-facts-about-hillary-clinton-and-the-kathy-shelton-rape-case/|title=The facts about Hillary Clinton and the Kathy Shelton rape case|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|date=11 Oct 2016|accessdate=13 November 2016|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> Later in 2016, Shelton claimed that she had been misquoted in the 2007 interview. She told the ''Daily Beast'' in 2014, "Hillary Clinton took me through hell."<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/10/11/the-facts-about-hillary-clinton-and-the-kathy-shelton-rape-case/|title=The facts about Hillary Clinton and the Kathy Shelton rape case|last=|first=|date=2016|work=The Washington Post|access-date=}}</ref> Shelton said, "I started seeing where I had really been stomped in the ground. I didn't really know what to do about it. I just figured life would have to go on and I would have to live with it".<ref name="Rogin">{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/20/exclusive-hillary-clinton-took-me-through-hell-rape-victim-says.html|title=Exclusive: 'Hillary Clinton Took Me Through Hell,' Rape Victim Says|last1=Rogin|first1=Josh|date=14 Nov 2016|accessdate=14 November 2016|publisher=The Daily Beast}}</ref> She also said it was after hearing Clinton discussing the case in previously unpublished tapes that she decided to speak out publicly.<ref name="Kessler" /><ref name="latimes.com">[http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-trump-clinton-accusers-20161009-snap-story.html Seema Mehta, "What you need to know about the four women Donald Trump appeared with at a surprise pre-debate event", Los Angeles Times, October 9, 2016]</ref> 

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Shelton was interviewed by ''The Daily Mail'', a British tabloid, and set up a [[GoFundMe]] page to raise $10,000.<ref name=":1" /> On the page, she stated that Clinton had forced her to "undergo multiple polygraph tests" and "was sent for a psychiatric examination". However, according to ''The Washington Post'' fact-checker, there is no evidence that Clinton played a role in Shelton taking a polygraph test. Shelton did not undergo psychiatric examination: "one day after Clinton filed a request for psychiatric exam, it was denied by the judge."<ref name=":1" /> After ''The Washington Post'' published its fact-check of Shelton's claims, the GoFundMe site removed the text about polygraph tests and psychiatric examinations.<ref name=":1" />

During the campaign, Shelton spoke out against Clinton in a surprise press conference held by [[Donald Trump]] before the [[United States presidential election debates, 2016#Second presidential debate .28Washington University in St. Louis.29|second presidential debate]] between him and Hillary Clinton. Also attending the conference were [[Juanita Broaddrick]], [[Paula Jones]] and [[Kathleen Willey]].<ref name="houstonchronicle_101116">{{cite web|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|title=The facts about Hillary Clinton and the Kathy Shelton rape case |url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/election/national/article/The-facts-about-Hillary-Clinton-and-the-Kathy-9962157.php|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=15 October 2016|date=October 11, 2016}}</ref>
