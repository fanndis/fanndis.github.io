{{short description|Governmental agency in many states of the United States responsible for providing child protection}}
{{Family law}}
'''Child Protective Services''' ('''CPS''') is the name of a government agency in many [[US states|states]] of the United States responsible for providing [[child protection]], which includes responding to reports of [[child abuse]] or neglect.  Some states use other names, often attempting to reflect more family-centered (as opposed to child-centered) practices, such as '''Department of Children & Family Services''' ('''DCFS'''). CPS is also known by the name of '''Department of Social Services''' ('''DSS''') or simply Social Services.

==History==
In 1690, in what is now the Americas, there were criminal court cases involving child abuse.<ref>Pecora ''et al.'' (1992), p. 231.</ref>  In 1692, states and municipalities identified care for abused and neglected children as the responsibility of local government and private institutions.<ref>''Ibid.'', pp. 230-1.</ref> In 1696, The Kingdom of England first used the legal principle of ''[[parens patriae]],'' which gave the royal crown care of "charities, infants, idiots, and lunatics returned to the chancery."  This principle of ''parens patriae'' has been identified as the statutory basis for U.S. governmental intervention in families' child rearing practices.<ref>''Ibid.'', p. 230.</ref>

In 1825, states enacted laws giving social-welfare agencies the right to remove neglected children from their parents and from the streets.  These children were placed in almshouses, in orphanages and with other families. In 1835, the [[Humane Society]] founded the National Federation of Child Rescue agencies to investigate child maltreatment. In the late-19th century, private child protection agencies{{spaced ndash}}modeled after existing animal protection organizations{{spaced ndash}}developed to investigate reports of child maltreatment, present cases in court and advocate for child welfare legislation.<ref>Pecora ''et al.'' (1992), pp. 230-31; Petr (1998), p. 126.</ref>

In 1853, the [[Children's Aid Society]] was founded in response to the problem of orphaned or abandoned children living in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensaidsociety.org/about/history|title=History|author=Children's Aid Society}}</ref> Rather than allow these children to become institutionalized or continue to live on the streets, the children were placed in the first “foster” homes, typically with the intention of helping these families work their farms as slave labor.<ref name="Axinn">{{cite book|author2=Levin, Herman|author1=Axinn, June|title=Social Welfare: a history of the American response to need|year=1997|publisher=Longman|location=White Plains, New York|isbn=9780801317002|edition=4th|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/socialwelfarehis00axin_0}}</ref><ref name="Ellett">{{cite journal|last=Ellett|first=Alberta J.|author2=Leighninger, Leslie|title=What Happened?

In 1874, the first case of child abuse was criminally prosecuted in what has come to be known as the "[[Mary Ellen Wilson|case of Mary Ellen]]." Outrage over this case started an organized effort against child maltreatment<ref name="Crosson">{{cite book|last=Crosson-Tower|first=Cynthia|title=Understanding child abuse and neglect|year=1999|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston|isbn=9780205287802|edition=4th}}</ref> In 1909, [[Teddy Roosevelt|President Theodore Roosevelt]] convened the White House Conference on Child Dependency, which created a publicly funded volunteer organization to "establish and publicize standards of child care."<ref name="Axinn"/> By 1926, 18 states had some version of county child welfare boards whose purpose was to coordinate public and private child related work.<ref name="Ellett"/> Issues of abuse and neglect were addressed in the [[Social Security Act]] in 1930, which provided funding for intervention for “neglected and dependent children in danger of becoming delinquent.” <ref name="Crosson"/>

In 1912, the federal [[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]] was established with a mandate that included services related to child maltreatment.  In 1958, amendments to the [[Social Security Act]] mandated that states fund child protection efforts.<ref>Laird & Michael (2006).</ref>  In 1962, professional and media interest in child maltreatment was sparked by the publication of [[C. Henry Kempe]] and associates' "The battered child syndrome" in [[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]].  By the mid-1960s, in response to public concern that resulted from this article, 49 U.S. states passed child-abuse reporting laws.<ref>Pecora ''et al.'' (1992), p. 232;  Petr (1998), p. 126.</ref>  In 1974, these efforts by the states culminated in the passage of the federal [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] (CAPTA; Public Law 93-247) providing federal funding for wide-ranging federal and state child-maltreatment research and services.<ref>Pecora ''et al.'' (1992), pp. 232-3; Petr (1998), pp. 126-7.</ref> In 1980, Congress passed the first comprehensive federal child protective services act, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-272), which focused on family preservation efforts to help keep families together and children out of foster care or other out-of-home placement options.<ref>{{cite web|title= What Is The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act? |url=http://adoption.about.com/od/agenciesandproviders/f/What-Is-The-Adoption-Assistance-And-Child-Welfare-Act.htm}}</ref>

Partly funded by the federal government, Child Protective Services (CPS) agencies were first established in response to the 1974 [[CAPTA]] which mandated that all states establish procedures to investigate suspected incidents of child maltreatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/factsheets/about/|title=About CAPTA: A Legislative History - Child Welfare Information Gateway|website=www.childwelfare.gov}}</ref>

In the 1940s and 1950s, due to improved technology in [[diagnostic radiology]], the medical profession began to take notice of what they believed to be intentional injuries,   the so-called "Shaken Baby Syndrome." 
<ref name="Antler">{{cite journal|author=Antler, S|year=1978|title=Child Abuse: An emerging social priority|journal=Social Work|volume=23|pages=58–61}}</ref> In 1961, [[C. Henry Kempe]] began to further research this issue, eventually identifying and coining the term [[battered child syndrome]].<ref name="Antler"/> At this same time, there were also changing views about the role of the child in society, fueled in part by the [[Civil Rights Movement]].<ref name="Ellett"/>

In 1973, Congress took the first steps toward enacting federal legislature to address the issues of poverty and minorities. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/federal/index.cfm?event=federalLegislation.viewLegis&id=2|title=Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) of 1974 P.L. 93-247|work=Child Welfare Information Gateway|author=Administration for Children & Families|publisher=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services}}</ref> was passed in 1974, which required states "to prevent, identify and treat child abuse and neglect."<ref name="Crosson"/>

Shortly thereafter, in 1978, the [[Indian Child Welfare Act]] (ICWA) was passed in response to attempts to destroy the Native Americans by taking large numbers of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] children, separating them from their tribes and placed in foster care or sending them to far away schools where they were maltreated, lost and sometimes died.<ref name="Limb">{{cite journal|last=Limb|first=GE|author2=Chance, T |author3=Brown, EF |title=An empirical examination of the Indian Child Welfare Act and its impact on cultural and familial preservation for American Indian children|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|date=December 2004|volume=28|issue=12|pages=1279–89|pmid=15607770|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2004.06.012}}</ref> This legislation not only opened the door for consideration of cultural issues while stressing ideas that children should be with their families, leading to the beginnings of [[family preservation]] programs.<ref name="Mitchell">{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=LB|author2=Barth, RP |author3=Green, R |author4=Wall, A |author5=Biemer, P |author6=Berrick, JD |author7= Webb, MB |title=Child welfare reform in the United States: findings from a local agency survey.|journal=Child Welfare|date=Jan–Feb 2005|volume=84|issue=1|pages=5–24|pmid=15717771}}</ref> In 1980, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act<ref name=adoption-ass /> was introduced as a way to manage the high numbers of children in placement.<ref name="Ellett"/> Although this legislation addressed some of the complaints from earlier pieces of legislation around destroying due process for parents, these changes were not designed to alleviate the high numbers of children in placement or continuing delays in permanence.<ref name="Mitchell"/> This led to the introduction of the home visitation models, which provided funding to private agencies to force parents into intensive services in cases where the children were not favorable on the adoption market.<ref name="Ellett"/>

In addition to family services, the focus of federal child welfare policy changed to try to address permanence for the large numbers of foster children care.<ref name="Mitchell"/> Several pieces of federal legislation attempted to ease the process of forcing adoption and taking away parental rights, including incentives for adoption and removal with the Adoption Assistance Act;<ref name=adoption-ass>{{cite web|url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/otherpubs/majorfedlegis.cfm|title=Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 P.L. 96-272|author=Administration for Children & Families|work=Child Welfare Information Gateway|publisher=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services|access-date=2013-01-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115234227/https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/otherpubs/majorfedlegis.cfm|archive-date=2013-01-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> the 1988 Child Abuse Prevention, Adoption, and Family Services Act; and the 1992 Child Abuse, Domestic Violence, Adoption, and Family Services Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/otherpubs/majorfedlegis.cfm|title=Major Federal Legislation Concerned with Child Protection, Child Welfare, and Adoption|author=Administration for Children & Families|work=Child Welfare Information Gateway|publisher=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services|year=2011|access-date=2013-01-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115234227/https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/otherpubs/majorfedlegis.cfm|archive-date=2013-01-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> The 1994 [[Multi-Ethnic Placement Act]], which was revised in 1996 to add the Interethnic Placement Provisions, also attempted to promote permanency through forced adoption, creating regulations that adoptions could not be delayed or denied due to issues of due process, fairness, Constitutional compliance, parental rights, the children's right, discrimination, race, color, or national origin of the child or the adoptive parent.<ref name="Lincroft">{{cite web|url=http://www.aecf.org/KnowledgeCenter/Publications.aspx?pubguid={A6A32287-6D6B-4580-9365-D7E635E35569}|author1=Lincroft, Y.|author2=Resher, J.|year=2006|title=Undercounted and Underserved: Immigrant and refugee families in the child welfare system|publisher=The Annie E.

All of these policies led up to the 1997 [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] (ASFA), much of which guides current practice. Changes in the Adoptions and Safe Families Act showed an interest in cosmetically shifting the emphasis towards children's health and safety concerns and away from a policy of reuniting children with their birth parents without regard to prior abusiveness.<ref name="Lincroft"/> This law requires counties to provide "reasonable efforts" to preserve or reunify families, but required that states move to terminate parental rights for children who had been in foster care for 15 out of the last 22 months, with several exceptions.<ref name="Ellett"/><ref name="Lincroft"/><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Mitchell, Lorelei B. |author2=Barth, Richard P. |author3=Green, Rebecca |author4=Wall, Ariana |author5=Biemer, Paul |author6=Berrick, Jill Duerr |author7=Webb, Mary Bruce |title=Child Welfare Reform in the United States: Findings from a Local Agency Survey|journal=Child Welfare|volume=84|number=1|pages=5–24 [20]|issn=0009-4021}}</ref>

==Comparison to other similar systems==

===Brazil===
For decades, before 1990, there had been pressure from NGOs and children's organizations for protecting children battered by poverty and hunger and despised by sections of the community in Brazil. After this, became a chapter on the rights of children and adolescents in The Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil. In 1990, an even greater victory, when the Statute of the Child and Adolescent was approv
ligating the Government to protect child rights. This ensured a comprehensive child welfare system in Brazil. To ensure that the Statute's provisions are enforced, Councils for the Rights of the Child and Adolescent were set up at federal, state and local levels.

The National Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents (CONANDA) is Federal Authority. The Councils of Guardianship are the Local Authorities and have duties and responsibilities towards children in their area. All work is based in STATUTE OF THE CHILD AND ADOLESCENT (Law No. 8,069, July 13, 1990).<ref>CONANDA (National Council for the Rights of the Child and the Adolescent) (2014, September 6).

The federal government passed Bill C-92 — officially known as An Act Respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis Children, Youth and Families  — in June 2019 coming into force on January 1, 2020. The new legislation creates national standards on how Indigenous children are to be treated. For example, when looking to place kids in foster care, authorities are to prioritize extended family and home communities. The law also allows Indigenous communities to create their own child welfare laws. Indigenous children make up seven per cent of Canada's population, but they represent about 50 per cent of youth in care.<ref>[https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/the-government-of-canada-announces-the-coming-into-force-of-an-act-respecting-first-nations-inuit-and-metis-children-youth-and-families-810646408.html ]</ref><ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/child-welfare-legislation-changes-impact-first-nations-1.5388252 ]</ref><ref>[https://aptnnews.ca/2020/01/01/federal-indigenous-child-welfare-bill-c-92-kicks-in/ ]</ref>

===Costa Rica===
The Patronato Nacional de la Infancia (PANI) is responsible for Child Protection in Costa Rica.<ref name="pani.go.cr">{{cite web|url=http://www.pani.go.cr|title=Inicio · Patronato Nacional de la Infancia PANI Costa Rica|website=www.pani.go.cr|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>

The agency was founded in 1930 by Dr. Luis Felipe Gonzalez Flores, a Costa Rican magnate at the time. It was founded to combat infant mortality, that at the time, was rampant in Costa Rica. The idea was to put infants up for adoption that the mother could not afford to support (abortion is a crime in Costa Rica).<ref name="pani.go.cr"/>

In 1949, after the [[Costa Rican Civil War]], a new constitution was written, it called for the agency to be an autonomous institution in the government, autonomous from any ministry.<ref name="pani.go.cr"/>

Today the focus is on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The agency still favors adoption, since abortion is illegal in Costa Rica.

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom]] has a comprehensive child welfare system under which [[local authorities]] have duties and responsibilities towards children in need in their area. This covers provision of advice and services, accommodation and care of children who become uncared for, and also the capacity to initiate proceedings for the removal of children from their parents care/care proceedings. The criteria for the latter is 'significant harm' which covers physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect. In appropriate cases the Care Plan before the Court will be for adoption. The Local Authorities also run adoption services both for children put up for [[adoption]] voluntarily and those becoming available for adoption through Court proceedings. The basic legal principle in all public and private proceedings concerning children, under the [[Children Act 1989]], is that the welfare of the child is paramount. In recognition of attachment issues, social work good practice requires a minimal number of moves and the 1989 Children Act enshrines the principle that delay is inimical to a child's welfare. Care proceedings have a time frame of 26 weeks (although capable of extension under certain circumstances) and concurrent planning is required. The final Care Plan put forward by the Local Authority is required to provide a plan for permanence, whether with parents, family members, long-term foster parents or adopters. The Court routinely joins children as parties to their own Care proceedings, and their best interests are explored and advanced by Children's Guardians, independent Social Workers who specialise in representation of children in proceedings. It is a feature of Care proceedings that judges of all levels are expected to adhere to the recommendations of the Children's Guardian unless there are cogent reasons not to. Nevertheless, 'drift' and multiple placements still occur as many older children are difficult to place or maintain in placements. The role of [[Independent Visitor]], a voluntary post, was created in the United Kingdom under the 1989 Children Act to befriend and assist children and young people in care.

In [[England]], [[Wales]] and Scotland, there never has been a statutory obligation to report alleged child abuse to the Police. However both the Children Act 1989 and 2004 makes clear a statutory obligation on all professionals to report suspected child abuse.

The statutory guidance Working Together to Safeguard Children 2006 created the role of Local Authority Designated Officer, This officer is responsible for managing allegations of abuse against adults who work with children (Teachers, Social Workers, Church leaders, Youth Workers etc.).

[[Local Safeguarding Children Board]]s (LSCBs) are responsible ensuring agencies and professionals, in their area, effectively safeguard and promote the welfare of children. In the event of the death or serious injury of a child, LSCBs can initiate a '[[Serious Case Review]]' aimed at identifying agency failings and improving future practice.

The planned ContactPoint database, under which information on children is shared between professionals, has been halted by the newly elected coalition government (May 2010). The database was aimed at improving information sharing across agencies. Lack of information sharing had been identified as a failing in numerous high-profile child death cases. Critics of the scheme claimed it was evidence of a 'big brother state' and too expensive to introduce.

Working Together to Safeguard Children 2006 (updated in 2010) and the subsequent 'The Protection of Children in England: A Progress Report' (Laming, 2009) continue to promote the sharing of data between those working with vulnerable children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-practitioners-information-sharing-advice|title=Information sharing advice for safeguarding practitioners - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>

A child in suitable cases can be made a ward of court and no decisions about the child or changes in its life can be made without the leave of the High Court.

In England the [[Murder of Victoria Climbié]] was largely responsible for various changes in child protection in England, including the formation of the [[Every Child Matters]] programme in 2003. A similar programme – [[Getting it Right for Every Child – GIRFEC]] was established in Scotland in 2008.

A bill is being{{when| date=May 2019}} debated in the UK parliament which many people and organisations fear will take away the statutory duty local authorities have to protect vulnerable children.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38933234 Government adviser walks away from child protection plans] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>

==Standards for reporting==
Generally speaking, a report must be made when an individual knows or has reasonable cause to believe or suspect that a child has been subjected to abuse or neglect. These standards guide mandatory reporters in deciding whether to make a report to child protective services. However due to the policy of the business to protect the identity of the reporter many reports have been made due to conflict with other parents or hospitals/doctors being sued by parents concerned with the way their child's needs have been addressed <ref name="childwelfare1">{{cite web |url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.cfm |title=Definitions of Child Abuse and Neglect |publisher=Childwelfare.gov |accessdate=2010-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824080653/http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.cfm |archive-date=2010-08-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Persons responsible for the child===
In addition to defining acts or omissions that constitute child abuse or neglect, several states' statutes provide specific definitions of persons who can get reported to child protective services as perpetrators of abuse or neglect. These are persons who have some relationship or regular responsibility for the child. This generally includes parents, grandparents, guardians, foster parents, relatives, legal guardians or bystanders. Once taken away from home, the stated goal of CPS is to reunite the child with their family, however this is largely lip service.  In some cases, due to the nature of abuse children are not able to see or converse with the abusers.  If parents fail to complete Court Ordered terms and conditions, the children in care may never return home. Most terms and conditions are set by the CPS caseworkers, not the courts, with the intent to drag out the case and so the 15 month deadline can be met.<ref name="childwelfare1"/>

==Child Protective Services statistics==

The United States government's [[Administration for Children and Families]] reported that in 2004 approximately 3.5 million children were involved in investigations of alleged abuse or neglect in the US, while an estimated 872,000 children were determined to have been abused or neglected, and an estimated 1,490 children died that year because of abuse or neglect. In 2007, 1,760 children died as the result of child abuse and neglect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.preventchildabuseny.org/files/1713/0392/2368/2007CANFactSheet.pdf|title=2007 Child Abuse and Neglect Fact Sheet|author=Prevent Child Abuse New York|access-date=2013-01-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403173207/http://www.preventchildabuseny.org/files/1713/0392/2368/2007CANFactSheet.pdf|archive-date=2015-04-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> Child abuse impacts the most vulnerable populations, with children under age five years accounting for 76% of fatalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/newsroom/fact-sheets/fatalities-due-to-child-abuse-neglect.html|title=Emotional Abuse|author=American Humane Association|work=Stop Child Abuse|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dy6QEsOv?url=http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/newsroom/fact-sheets/fatalities-due-to-child-abuse-neglect.html|archive-date=2013-01-26}}</ref> In 2008, 8.3 children per 1000 were victims of child abuse and neglect and 10.2 children per 1000 were in out of home placement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://datacenter.kidscount.org/|title=Kids Count Data Center|publisher=The Annie E.

===Child Protective Services recidivism in the United States===
In order to understand CPS recidivism in the U.S., there are several terms that readers must familiarize themselves with. Two often-used terms in CPS recidivism are rereport (also known as rereferral) and recurrence. Either of the two can occur after an initial report of child abuse or neglect called an index report. Although the definitions of rereport and recurrence is not consistent, the general difference is that a rereport is a subsequent report of child abuse or neglect after an initial report (also known as an index report) whereas recurrence refers to a confirmed (also known as substantiated) rereport after an initial report of child abuse and neglect. Borrowing from the definition used by Pecora et al. (2000),<ref name="Pecora">{{cite book|author1=Pecora, P. J. |author2=Whittaker, J. |author3=Maluccio, A. |author4=Barth, R. |name-list-style=amp |title=The child welfare challenge: Policy, practice, and research|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780202361260 |url-access=registration |year=2000|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter}}</ref> recidivism is defined as, “Recurring child abuse and neglect, the subsequent or repeated maltreatment of a child after identification to public authorities.” It is important to highlight that this definition is not all-inclusive because it does not include abused children who are not reported to authorities.<ref name="Pecora"/>

===Recidivism statistics===
There are three main sources of recidivism data in the U.S.—the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS), the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW), and the National Incidence Study (NIS)—and they all have their own respective strengths and weaknesses. NCANDS was established in 1974, and it consists of administrative data of all reports of suspected child abuse and neglect investigated by CPS. NSCAW was established in 1996 and is similar to NCANDS in that it only includes reports of child abuse and neglect investigated by CPS, but it adds clinical measures related to child and family well-being that NCANDS is lacking. NIS was established in 1974, and it consists of data collected from CPS as well. However, it attempts to gather a more comprehensive picture of the incidence of child abuse and neglect by collecting data from other reporting sources called community sentinels.<ref name="Wulczyn">{{cite journal|last=Wulczyn|first=F.|title=Epidemiological Perspectives on Maltreatment Prevention|journal=The Future of Children|volume=19|issue=2|year=2009|pages=39–66|doi=10.1353/foc.0.0029|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Brenda Scott, in her 1994 book ''Out of Control: Who's Watching Our Child Protection Agencies'', criticizes CPS, stating, "Child Protective Services is out of control. The system, as it operates today, should be scrapped. If children are to be protected in their homes and in the system, radical new guidelines must be adopted. At the core of the problem is the antifamily mindset of CPS. Removal is the first resort, not the last. With insufficient checks and balances, the system that was designed to protect children has become the greatest perpetrator of harm."<ref>Scott, Brenda (1994) ''Out of Control: Who's Watching Our Child Protection Agencies?'' p. 179</ref>

===Texas===
The [[Texas Department of Family and Protective Services]] had itself been an object of reports of unusual numbers of poisonings, death, rapes and pregnancies of children under its care since 2004. The Texas Family and Protective Services Crisis Management Team was created by executive order after the critical report [https://www.scribd.com/doc/38352706/Carole-Keeton-Strayhorn-Texas-Comptroller-Forgotten-Children-2004 Forgotten Children] of 2004.

Texas Child Protective Services was hit with a rare if not unprecedented legal sanction for a "groundless cause of action" and ordered to pay $32,000 of the Spring family's attorney fees. Judge Schneider wrote in a 13-page order, "The offensive conduct by (CPS) has significantly interfered with the legitimate exercise of the traditional core functions of this court."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7491943.html|title=Judge comes down on Texas CPS in twins case|website=chron.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>

====2008 Raid of YFZ Ranch====
{{Main|YFZ Ranch}}

In April 2008, the largest child protection action in American history raised questions as the CPS in Texas removed hundreds of minor children, infants, and women incorrectly believed to be children from the [[YFZ Ranch]] polygamist community, with the assistance of heavily armed police with an armored personnel carrier. Investigators, including supervisor [[Angie Voss]] convinced a judge that all of the children were at risk of child abuse because they were all being groomed for under-age marriage. The state supreme court disagreed, releasing most children back to their families. Investigations would result in criminal charges against some men in the community.

Gene Grounds of Victim Relief Ministries commended CPS workers in the Texas operation as exhibiting compassion, professionalism and caring concern.<ref>[http://www.kvue.com/news/state/stories/041808kvuejanetpolygamy-cb.779df065.html KVUE.com]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Richardson group: Polygamists' children are OK April 18, 2008 by Janet St. James / [[WFAA-TV]]</ref> However, CPS performance was questioned by workers from the Hill Country Community Mental Health-Mental Retardation Center. One wrote "I have never seen women and children treated this poorly, not to mention their civil rights being disregarded in this manner" after assisting at the emergency shelter. Others who were previously forbidden to discuss conditions working with CPS later produced unsigned written reports expressed anger at the CPS traumatizing the children, and disregarding rights of mothers who appeared to be good parents of healthy, well-behaved children. CPS threatened some MHMR workers with arrest, and the entire mental health support was dismissed the second week due to being "too compassionate." Workers believed poor sanitary conditions at the shelter allowed [[respiratory infections]] and [[chicken pox]] to spread.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/metro/5770183.html|title=Mental health workers rip CPS over sect

====CPS problem reports====
The [[Texas Department of Family and Protective Services]], as with other states, had itself been an object of reports of unusual numbers of poisonings, death, rapes and pregnancies of children under its care since 2004. The Texas Family and Protective Services Crisis Management Team was created by executive order after the critical report Forgotten Children<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.window.state.tx.us/forgottenchildren/in|title=Welcome to the New Comptroller.Texas.Gov|first=Texas Comptroller of Public|last=Accounts|website=www.window.state.tx.us|accessdate=21 March 2018}}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> of 2004. Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn made a statement in 2006 about the Texas foster care system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.window.state.tx.us/news/60623statement.html|title=Welcome to the New Comptroller.Texas.Gov|first=Texas Comptroller of Public|last=Accounts|website=www.window.state.tx.us|accessdate=21 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527040449/http://www.window.state.tx.us/news/60623statement.html|archive-date=27 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In Fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively 30, 38 and 48 foster children died in the state's care. The number of foster children in the state's care increased 24 percent to 32,474 in Fiscal 2005, while the number of deaths increased 60 percent. Compared to the general population, a child is four times more likely to die in the Texas foster care system. In 2004, about 100 children were treated for poisoning from medications; 63 were treated for rape that occurred while under state care including four-year old twin boys, and 142 children gave birth, though others believe Ms. Strayhorn's report was not scientifically researched, and that major reforms need to be put in place to assure that children in the conservatorship of the state get as much attention as those at risk in their homes.

===Disproportionality and disparity in the child welfare system===
In the United States, data suggests that a disproportionate number of minority children, particularly African American and [[Aboriginal child protection|Native American children]], enter the foster care system.<ref name="Hill, R.B. (2004)">Hill R.B. (2004) Institutional racism in child welfare. In J. Everett, S. Chipungu & B. Leashore (Eds.) Child welfare revisited (pp. 57-76). New Brunswick, NJ: [[Rutgers University Press]].</ref> National data in the United States provides evidence that disproportionality may vary throughout the course of a child's involvement with the child welfare system. Differing rates of disproportionality are seen at key decision points including the reporting of abuse, substantiation of abuse, and placement into foster care.<ref name="Hill, R.B.(2006)">Hill, R. B (2006) Synthesis of research on disproportionality in child welfare: An update. Casey-CSSP Alliance for Racial Equity in Child Welfare.</ref> Additionally, once they enter foster care, research suggests that they are likely to remain in care longer.<ref name="Wulczyn, F., Lery, B., Haight, J., (2006)">Wulczyn, F. Lery, B., Haight, J., (2006) Entry and Exit Disparities in the Tennessee Foster Care System. Chapin Hall Discussion Paper.</ref>
Research has shown that there is no difference in the rate of abuse and neglect among minority populations when compared to Caucasian children that would account for the disparity.<ref name="Sedlak, A., Broadhurst, G. (1996)">National Incidence Study (NIS), U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Administration for Children & Families, (1996)</ref>
The Juvenile Justice system has also been challenged by disproportionate negative contact of minority children.<ref name="Pope, C.E. & Feyerherm, W. (1995)">Pope, C.E. & Feyerherm, W. (1995) Minorities and the Juvenile Justice System Research Symmary. Washington, DC: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention</ref> Because of the overlap in these systems, it is likely that this phenomenon within multiple systems may be related.

The  [[American Journal of Public Health]]  estimate that 37.4% of all children experience a child protective services investigation by age 18 years. Consistent with previous literature, we found a higher rate for African American children (53.0%) and the lowest rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders (10.2%). They conclude child maltreatment investigations are more common than is generally recognized when viewed across the lifespan. Building on other recent work, our data suggest a critical need for increased preventative and treatment resources in the area of child maltreatment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hyunil|last2=Wildeman|first2=Christopher|last3=Jonson-Reid|first3=Melissa|last4=Drake|first4=Brett|date=2017-01-11|title=Lifetime Prevalence of Investigating Child Maltreatment Among US Children|url=https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303545|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=107|issue=2|pages=274–280|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2016.303545|issn=0090-0036|pmc=5227926|pmid=27997240}}</ref>

=== Constitutional issues ===
In May 2007, the United States 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found in ''Rogers v.

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] says that a state may not make a law that abridges "... the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States" and no state may "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."

In a case of ''Santosky v. Kramer, 455 US 745'' (1982), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] reviewed a case when Department of Social Services removed two younger children from their natural parents only because the parents had been previously found negligent toward their oldest daughter.<ref name="santosky">{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16163171324148079216|title=Santosky v.

The Supreme Court vacated previous judgment and stated: "Before a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least [[Legal burden of proof#Clear and convincing evidence|clear and convincing evidence]]. But until the State proves parental unfitness, the child and their parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship".<ref name="santosky" />

=== Notable lawsuits ===
In 2010 an ex-foster child was awarded $30 million by jury trial in [[California]] ([[Santa Clara County]]) for sexual abuse damages that happened to him in foster home from 1995 to 1999; he was represented by attorney [[Stephen John Estey]].<ref name="calif">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2010/08/05/south-bay-sex-abuse-lawsuit-ex-foster-child-awarded-30-million/|title=South Bay sex-abuse lawsuit: Ex-foster child awarded $30 million|date=August 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100805006437/en/Estey-Bomberger-announces-Jury-Awards-30-Million|title=Estey & Bomberger announces Jury Awards $30 Million in San Jose Molestation Case|date=August 5, 2010|website=www.businesswire.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.childmolestationvictims.com/case-studies/john-doe-v-family-foster-agency/|title=CASE: John Doe v.

In 2007 Deanna Fogarty-Hardwick obtained a jury verdict against Orange County (California) and two of its social workers for violating her Fourteenth Amendment rights to familial association.<ref name="fog">{{Cite web|url=https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/order-granting-fees-incurred-on-appeal-f-36064/|title=Fogarty-Hardwick v.

This case, which has come to be called the "right to lie" case set a precedent of how caseworkers can handle cases to which they are assigned. It was adamantly argued, by the defense, that caseworkers should be allowed to make up things in order to sway the judges decision to remove a child from his/her fit parent(s). The defense attorney even tried to justify the right of the caseworkers to lie saying that the statutes which cover perjury are "state statutes".

In 2018 Rafaelina Duval obtained a jury verdict against Los Angeles County (California) and two of its social workers for an unwarranted seizure of her child.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=L.A.

In 2019 Rachel Bruno obtained an award against social services and Children’s Hospital of Orange County (CHOC) after they took her 20-month-old son and ran unauthorized medical tests on him and injected him with a dozen vaccinations at the same time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=California mom recalls how son rejected her for 1 year after unlawful CPS removal|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/california-mom-recalls-how-son-rejected-her-for-1-year-after-unlawful-cps-removal.html|access-date=2020-11-18|website=www.christianpost.com|language=en}}</ref> The 1.49 million dollar award was given for the damage social workers and hospital staff did to the Brunos’ civil rights by ordering tests on David without valid warrants or parental consent. The medical tests were to determine if he was sexually abused, even though there were no allegations that abuse occurred. An invasive test was performed on him at CHOC, along with a full skeletal x-ray for which he had to be forcibly held down. David was seized without a warrant from his parents while his newborn brother Lucas was in the hospital for a head injury that was under investigation by the county. Child services suspected that Lucas’s injury was from abuse, and although the mother and nanny were the only two in the home when the injury occurred, child services blamed Bruno and only questioned the nanny once before letting her go. No evidence was ever found that anyone had harmed the newborn intentionally and the state’s attorney declined to prosecute.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fox|first=Megan|title=California Mom Wins Second Big Settlement Against CPS for Seizing, Vaccinating Son Without Warrant|url=https://pjmedia.com/parenting/megan-fox/2019/07/10/california-mom-wins-second-big-settlement-against-cps-for-seizing-vaccinating-son-without-warrant-n114147|access-date=2020-11-18|website=pjmedia.com|language=en}}</ref> 

===California===
In April 2013, Child Protective Services in [[Sacramento]] sent in police to forcibly remove a 5-month-old baby from the care of parents.

Alex and Anna Nikolayev took their baby Sammy out of [[Sutter Memorial Hospital]] and sought a second opinion at [[Kaiser Permanente]], a competing hospital, for Sammy's flu-like symptoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://natomas.news10.net/news/news/136673-couple-still-unclear-why-cps-took-their-baby|title=News10 – Couple still unclear why CPS took their baby|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130703071644/http://natomas.news10.net/news/news/136673-couple-still-unclear-why-cps-took-their-baby|archive-date=2013-07-03}}</ref> Police arrived at Kaiser and questioned the couple and doctors. Once Sammy had been fully cleared to leave the hospital, the couple went home, but the following day police arrived and took Sammy. On June 25, 2013 the case against the family was dismissed and the family filed a lawsuit against CPS and the Sacramento Police Department.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.news10.net/news/local/article/248770/476/CPS-case-against-Nikolayev-family-dismissed |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522232626/http://archive.news10.net/news/local/article/248770/476/CPS-case-against-Nikolayev-family-dismissed |archive-date=2014-05-22 }}</ref>

In [[Stockton, California]], two children were taken away from Vuk and Verica Nastić in June 2010 after the children's naked photos were found on the father's computer. Such photos are common in [[Serbia]]n culture. Furthermore, parents claim that their ethnic and religious rights have been violated – children are not permitted to speak Serbian, nor to meet with their parents for orthodox Christmas. They could only meet their mother once a week. Children have suffered psychological trauma due to their separation from parents. A polygraph test showed that the father did not abuse the children. The trial was set for January 26. Psychologists from Serbia stated that a few hours of conversation with children are enough to see whether they have been abused. The children were taken from their family 7 months ago. The [[FBI]] started an investigation against the CPS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalvoices.org/2011/01/04/united-states-serbian-couple-struggles-to-get-children-back/ |title=United States: Serbian Couple Struggles to Get Children Back · Global Voices |publisher=Globalvoices.org |date=2011-01-04 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2010&mm=12&dd=21&nav_id=71657 |title=News – U.S.: Serbian couple fights to get children back |publisher=B92 |accessdate=2013-11-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011553/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2010&mm=12&dd=21&nav_id=71657 |archive-date=2013-12-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/u_fokusu/story/146886/Otac+na+poligrafu+dokazao+da+nije+zlostavljao+decu.html |title=Press Online :: Press Green |publisher=Pressonline.rs |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> The children were reunited with their parents in February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2011&mm=02&dd=15&nav_id=72723|title=Serbian couple reunited with children - English - on B92.net|website=b92.net|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>

=== Illinois ===
Children and Family Services plays an important part in investigating and restoring children and families in order to better a society.  As the Children Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act of Illinois states, that upon receiving a report it is the responsibility of Department of Children and Families Services to conserve the health and safety of the child in any circumstances where the children experience abuse and neglect. Protective assistance to the child should be provided in order to maintain a proper mental health and psychological state for the child; which includes preserving family life whenever possible.<ref>{{Cite web|title=325 ILCS 5/  Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act.|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1460&ChapterID=32|website=www.ilga.gov|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref>  Sadly, in the most extreme cases, child abuse results in the death of a child.  In 2016, there were 64 child maltreatment deaths reported in Illinois—a rate of 2.19 per 100,000 children (U.S. DHHS, 2018). From 2012 to 2016, Illinois’ reported annual maltreatment-related deaths have been as high as 105 and as low as 64, with a decrease every year since 2014.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weiner|first=Dana|title=Systemic review of critical incidents in intact family services.|publisher=Chapin Hall at University of Chicago|year=2019|pages=https://www.chapinhall.org/wp-content/uploads/Systemic-Review-Critical-Incidents}}</ref>

==== Family Social Worker ====
Once a teacher, counselor, neighbor or any bystander calls child protective services. social workers start the investigation. Social workers have the obligation to visit clients into their homes in order to prove that the children and families are in good standings. Social workers are in charge to evaluate and verify that there is no academic, behavioral nor social problems that could affect the development of the children.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Child and Family Social Worker {{!}} Comprehensive Career Guide|url=https://www.socialwork.org/careers/child-and-family-social-worker/|last=Writers|first=Staff|date=2018-11-06|website=SocialWork.org|language=en|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref> The social worker will continue doing visitation until children and the family is stable and there is not more signs of abuse or neglect. If in the case that the situation it seems to not improve, the social worker can intervene and take the child away from family and be place in the foster system until parents or guardians pass test in order to have possibility to have the child back.

==== Perpetrators ====
The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) gathers and analyzes all screened-in referrals from the child protective services from all 50 states.  It defines a perpetrator as someone who has caused or permitted the abuse and neglect of a child to had happened.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Milner|first=Jerry|date=2018|title=Child Maltreatment|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/cm2018.pdf#page=21|journal=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Administration for Children and Families}}</ref> As NCANDS data on 2018 shows, in Illinois, 17,431 out of 18,958 perpetrators, or 77%, are parents of their victims, 6.4 percent are relatives and 4.6 percent had a different relationship to the child<sup>3</sup>. Within those numbers, 40 percent of the victims were abused and neglected by a mother acting alone and 21.5 percent by father acting alone<sup>3</sup>. Compared to Wisconsin where 2,502 out of 2,753 perpetrators are parents of the victims. Alcohol abuse and drug abuse have been identified as major risk factors which will increase child maltreatment.<sup>3  </sup>Evidence shows that there is an increase of victims if parents consume drugs or alcohol.

==== Child Protective Services Responsibilities and Case Load ====
Child Protective Services is composed of social workers, a position which does not require a degree in social work and in many cases any degree beyond a high school diploma, who assist families and children in complicated situations where abuse and neglect are alleged. National Association of Social Workers sets professional standards for social workers in family support programs, parenting programs and family-based services. According to these standards, social workers must act ethically, in accord with service, social justice, integrity and respect toward the person. Furthermore, the standards emphasize the importance that a social worker should have on serving as an advocate for the physical health and mental health of the children, youth and their families.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Association of Social Workers (NASW)|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/|website=NASW - National Association of Social Workers|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref> Moreover, social workers should be able to perform ongoing assessments in order to gather important information and intervene with adequate evidence in order to ensure safety of the child.<ref name=":1" />

However, throughout the years, social workers have struggled with a lack of resources, large caseloads and poor education. Social workers have to perform screening, investigations and identify alternative responses. Some social workers might need to provide additional services depending on the number of coworkers in their agencies and resources. In 2018, NCANDS reported that Illinois has only 150 workers who perform intake and screening for child abuse and neglect, and only 953 workers that follow up on reports.<ref name=":0" /> This provides evidence that child welfare social workers may find their daily responsibilities to be challenging. Compared with Michigan that has 177 workers who perform intake and screening for child abuse and neglect, and 1,549 workers that follow up on reports.

In addition to the challenges of a lack of resources and large caseloads, the Office of Inspector General identified issues that hinder effective service delivery.  Among individual professional social workers, cognitive fixation, knowledge deficit, and documentation burdens are problems. Among social worker teams, coordination and supervisory support are problems.  And environmental conditions, such as policies, training, and service array can also be inadequate. Based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics individual and family services social workers on 2018, had an annual mean wage of $42,972<ref>{{Cite web|title=Occupational Employment Statistics and Wages|url=https://www.bls.gov/oes/2018/may/oes211021.htm|website=U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics}}</ref> which might be taken as trivial amount compared to the amount of work that needed from social workers. An example of fixable efforts is Annie E. Casey Foundation Human Services Workforce Initiative (AECF). The initiative focuses on recruiting and retaining social workers with training and support in order to provide an effective resource for children and their family. States are doing different partnerships with colleges and universities to provide recruitment strategies that could attract students to find interest in the career of social work.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Child Welfare|url=http://www.socialworkpolicy.org/research/child-welfare-2.html|website=Social Work Policy Institute}}</ref>

In a nationwide study, researchers examined children in 595 families over a period of 9 years. They discovered that in the households where child abuse was substantiated by evidence, risk factors remained unchanged during interviews with the families.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/science/12child.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Nicholas | last=Bakalar | title=Doubts Rise Over Child Protective Service Inquiries | date=2010-10-11}}</ref> The study found that investigated subjects were not perceptibly different from noninvestigated subjects in social support, family functioning, poverty, maternal education, or child behavior problems after adjusting for baseline risk factors and that mothers of investigated subjects had more depressive symptoms than mothers of noninvestigated peers at the child's age of 8 years.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=20921352|journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med|date=October 2010|volume=164|issue=10 |pages=943–9|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.166|title=Household, family, and child risk factors after an investigation for suspected child maltreatment: a missed opportunity for prevention|vauthors=Campbell KA, Cook LJ, LaFleur BJ, Keenan HT|pmc=3955838}}</ref>
