A '''united church''', also called a '''uniting church''', is a [[church (denomination)|church]] formed from the merger or other form of union of two or more different [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|Christian denominations]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=United and Uniting churches — World Council of Churches|url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/church-families/united-and-uniting-churches|access-date=2020-09-04|website=www.oikoumene.org|language=en}}</ref>

Historically, unions of Protestant churches were enforced by the state, usually in order to have a stricter control over the religious sphere of its people, but also other organizational reasons. As modern [[Christian ecumenism]] progresses, unions between various Protestant traditions are becoming more and more common,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Haire|first=James|date=2017-03-06|title=United and Uniting Churches|url=https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199600847.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199600847-e-30|access-date=2020-09-04|website=The Oxford Handbook of Ecumenical Studies|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199600847.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199600847-e-30}}</ref> resulting in a growing number of united and uniting churches. Some of the recent major examples are the [[United Protestant Church of France]] (2013) and the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]] (2004).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=France|first=Eglise protestante unie de|title=La création de l'Église protestante unie de France|url=https://www.eglise-protestante-unie.fr/histoire/la-creation-de-l-eglise-protestante-unie-de-france-1|access-date=2020-09-04|website=Eglise protestante unie de France|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=United Protestant Church of France — World Council of Churches|url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/united-protestant-church-of-france|access-date=2020-09-04|website=www.oikoumene.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Three-way PKN union drastically changes Dutch denominational landscape » The Windmill news articles » goDutch|url=http://www.godutch.com/newspaper/index.php?id=571|access-date=2020-09-04|website=www.godutch.com}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Protestant Church in the Netherlands — World Council of Churches|url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/protestant-church-in-the-netherlands|access-date=2020-09-04|website=www.oikoumene.org|language=en}}</ref> As mainline Protestantism shrinks in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] due to the rise of [[secularism]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mainline Protestants make up shrinking number of U.S. adults|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/18/mainline-protestants-make-up-shrinking-number-of-u-s-adults/|access-date=2020-09-04|website=Pew Research Center|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-05-12|title=American Religion Statistics: Trends in U.S. Religious Affiliations|url=https://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/chapter-1-the-changing-religious-composition-of-the-u-s/|access-date=2020-09-04|website=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=2017-10-10|title=Amid Evangelical decline, growing split between young Christians and church elders|work=Christian Science Monitor|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2017/1010/Amid-Evangelical-decline-growing-split-between-young-Christians-and-church-elders|access-date=2020-09-04|issn=0882-7729}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Burge|first=Ryan P.|title=Evangelicals Show No Decline, Despite Trump and Nones|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2019/march/evangelical-nones-mainline-us-general-social-survey-gss.html|access-date=2020-09-04|website=News & Reporting|language=en}}</ref> [[Reformed]] and [[Lutheran]] denominations merge, often creating large nationwide denominations.<ref name=":0" /> The phenomenon is much less common among [[evangelical]], [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] and [[charismatic]] churches as new ones arise and many of them remain independent of each other.

Perhaps the oldest official united church is found in [[Germany]], where the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] is a federation of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], United ([[Prussian Union of churches|Prussian Union]]) and [[Reformed churches]], a union dating back to 1817. The first of the series of unions was at a synod in [[Idstein]] to form the [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau]] in August 1817, commemorated in naming the church of Idstein [[Unionskirche, Idstein|Unionskirche]] one hundred years later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nassau-info.de/geschichte-jb-kirche.htm |title=Staatlicher Dirigismus und neue Gläubigkeit (Die Kirche im Herzogtum Nassau) |publisher= Nassau-info.de |language=de}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Block|first=Mathew|date=2017-10-05|title=Remembering the 200th anniversary of the forced union of Lutheran and Reformed churches in Prussia|url=https://ilc-online.org/2017/10/05/remembering-200th-anniversary-forced-union-lutheran-reformed-churches-prussia/|access-date=2020-09-04|website=International Lutheran Council|language=en-US}}</ref>

Around the world, each united or uniting church comprises a different mix of predecessor Protestant denominations.<ref name=":0" /> Trends are visible, however, as most united and uniting churches have one or more predecessors with heritage in the [[Calvinism|Reformed tradition]] and many are members of the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]].

== Conciliar movement ==
In the 1950s and 1960s an ecumenical spirit emerged in many churches in the [[United States of America]], leading to a [[conciliar movement]] known in some circles as [[Conciliarity]]. A product of this movement was the [[Consultation on Church Union]] (COCU). The COCU disbanded formally in 2002 but moved into the [[Churches Uniting in Christ]] movement.<ref>Lahutsky, Nadia (Winter 2003). "The Union of Christians and Disciples in 1832 and COCU/CUIC".
