==Life and career==
LaSalle is the author of ''Complicated Women: Sex and Power in Pre-Code Hollywood'', a history/critical study of the actresses who worked in the film industry between 1929 and 1934. It was published by [[Thomas Dunne Books]] in 2000. In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Andy Webster called it "an overdue examination of a historic conflict between Hollywood and would-be monitors of morality" and added LaSalle "has an avuncular but informative style, and makes his points with a relaxed economy."<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E5DB163DF93BA35753C1A9669C8B63 ''The New York Times'' review of ''Complicated Women: Sex and Power in Pre-Code Hollywood'']</ref> Nationally syndicated columnist Liz Smith called it "a brilliant work."

The book served as the basis for the [[documentary film]] ''Complicated Women'', directed by Hugh Munro Neely and narrated by [[Jane Fonda]], which originally was broadcast by [[Turner Classic Movies]] in May 2003. LaSalle provided commentary for and was associate producer of the project.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=25794&mainArticleId=149209 ''Complicated Women'' at Turner Classic Movies]</ref>

LaSalle's follow-up to ''Complicated Women'' was ''Dangerous Men: Pre-Code Hollywood and the Birth of the Modern Man'', published by Thomas Dunne in 2002.
LaSalle has lectured on film subjects at various film festivals, including those in the Hamptons, [[Denver]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], and [[Mill Valley]] and at [[New York City]]'s [[Film Forum]] and [[San Francisco]]'s [[Castro Theatre]]. For several years, he taught a film course at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]; as of 2016, he teaches a film course at [[Stanford University]] Continuing Studies. His third book, "The Beauty of the Real: What Hollywood Can Learn From Contemporary French Actresses," was published in 2012.

In the late 1990s, LaSalle was the on-air film critic for [[KGO-TV]]. He was a panelist at the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014  [[Venice Film Festival]]s. He was also a panelist at the 2009 Berlin film festival. In addition to his reviews, he answers film-related questions in the ''Chronicle'' column ''Ask Mick LaSalle''.  As the primary film critic for the ''Chronicle'', LaSalle's reviews appear in all the Chronicle's sister newspapers of the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] chain, including the ''[[Connecticut Post]]'', the ''[[Albany Times-Union]]'', the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' and the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''.
