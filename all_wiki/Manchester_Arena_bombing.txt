On 22 May 2017, an [[Islamic extremism|Islamist extremist]] [[suicide bombing attack|suicide bomber]] detonated a [[nail bomb|shrapnel-laden]] [[homemade bomb]] as people were leaving the [[Manchester Arena]] following [[Dangerous Woman Tour|a concert]] by American singer [[Ariana Grande]].

Twenty-three<!-- The consensus is to phrase this along the lines of "23, including the attacker", as opposed to "22, excluding the attacker" --> people died, including the attacker, and more than 800 were wounded, some of them children. Several hundred more suffered [[psychological trauma]]. The bomber was Salman Ramadan Abedi, a 22-year-old local man of Libyan ancestry. After initial suspicions of a terrorist network, police later said they believed Abedi had largely acted alone but that others had been aware of his plans. In March 2020, the bomber's brother, Hashem Abedi, was found guilty of 22 counts of murder in relation to the attack.

The incident was the deadliest terrorist attack and the first suicide bombing in the United Kingdom since the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]].

==Attack==
On 22 May 2017 at 22:15 a member of the public reported Abedi, wearing black clothes and a large rucksack to Showsec security. One 18-year-old guard observed Abedi but did not intervene for fear of being branded racist. The security guard tried to use his radio to alert the security control room but was unable to get through.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-10-27|title=Manchester Arena Inquiry: Security 'did not approach bomber over racism fears'|language=en-gb|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-54695580|access-date=2020-11-01}}</ref>

His torso was propelled by the blast through the doors to the arena, possibly indicating that the explosive charge was held in the backpack and blew him forward on detonation.

==Kerslake Report==
On 27 March 2018, a report by [[Bob Kerslake]] named the "Kerslake Report" was published. The report was "an independent review into the preparedness for, and emergency response to, the Manchester Arena attack on 22nd May 2017."<ref name="Kerslake Report">{{cite web | title= The Kerslake Report: An independent review into the preparedness for, and emergency response to, the Manchester Arena attack on 22nd May 2017 |url= https://www.kerslakearenareview.co.uk/media/1022/kerslake_arena_review_printed_final.pdf | author1= Bob Kerslake|author2= Independent panel members |date= 27 March 2018| website= www.kerslakearenareview.co.uk| access-date= 27 March 2018|author1-link= Bob Kerslake }}</ref> In the report, Kerslake "largely praised" the [[Greater Manchester Police]] and [[British Transport Police]], and noted that it was "fortuitous" that the [[North West Ambulance Service]] was unaware of the declaration of Operation Plato, a protocol under which all responders should have withdrawn from the arena in case of an active killer on the premises.<ref name="Kerslake Report"/>{{rp|5.40}} However, it found that the [[Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service]] was "brought to a point of paralysis" as their response was delayed for two hours due to poor communication between the firefighters' [[liaison officer]] and the police force.<ref name="Kerslake Report"/>{{rp|5.155}}<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pidd |first1=Helen |title=Kerslake findings: emergency responses to Manchester Arena attack |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/27/kerslake-report-manchester-arena-attack-police-fire-ambulance-and-media-responses-to-attack |access-date=11 August 2020 |agency=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Jennifer |title=Kerslake Report into Manchester Arena bomb finds firefighters were held back by bosses for two hours on a night of 'extraordinary heroism' |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/kerslake-report-manchester-arena-bomb-14461431 |access-date=11 August 2020 |agency=[[Manchester Evening News]] |date=27 March 2018}}</ref>

The report was critical of [[Vodafone]] for the "catastrophic failure"<ref name="Kerslake Report"/>{{rp|5.47}} of an emergency helpline hosted on a platform provided by [[Content Guru]], saying that delays in getting information caused "significant stress and upset" to families.<ref name="Kerslake Report"/>{{rp|17}} It also expressed criticism of some news media, saying, "To have experienced such intrusive and overbearing behaviour at a time of such enormous vulnerability seemed to us to be completely and utterly unacceptable",<ref name="Kerslake Report"/>{{rp|19}} but noting that, "We recognise that this was some, but by no means all of the media and that the media also have a positive and important role to play."<ref name="Kerslake Report"/>{{rp|19}}
