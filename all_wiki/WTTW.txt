'''WTTW''', [[virtual channel]] 11 ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 25), is the primary Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]) [[Network affiliate#Member station|member]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], United States. Owned by [[non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] broadcasting entity Window to the World Communications, Inc., it is a [[sister station]] to [[First Nations Experience]] (FNX) [[Network affiliate|affiliate]] [[WYCC]] (channel 20) and [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[classical music]] radio station [[WFMT]] (98.7 FM). The three stations share studios in the Renée Crown Public Media Center, located at 5400 North Saint Louis Avenue (adjacent to the main campus of [[Northeastern Illinois University]]) in the city's [[North Park, Chicago|North Park]] neighborhood; WTTW and WYCC share transmitter facilities atop the [[Willis Tower]] on South [[Wacker Drive]] in the [[Chicago Loop]]. WTTW also owns and operates The Chicago Production Center, a video production and editing facility that is operated alongside the three stations.

WTTW is one of two PBS member stations serving the [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago market]], alongside [[Gary, Indiana]]-licensed [[WYIN]] (channel 56). WTTW, along with [[PBS Wisconsin]] [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] WHA-TV in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], serve as default PBS member stations for [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]] as that [[media market|market]] does not have a PBS station of its own; both stations are available in that market on local [[cable television|cable]] providers.

On December 7, 2017, Window to the World Communications announced that it was seeking to purchase WYCC from the [[City Colleges of Chicago]] in a move that would put WYCC and WTTW under one corporate umbrella.<ref name="Purchase WYCC">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-wycc-wttw-channel-share-sale-20171207-story.html|title=WTTW plans to buy rival public TV station WYCC's broadcast license|last=Channick|first=Robert|work=Chicago Tribune|date=December 7, 2017|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2017/12/08/robservations-wgn-presents-family-classics-suppelsa-farewell-tonight/|title=Robservations: WGN presents 'Family Classics'; Suppelsa farewell tonight|last=Feder|first=Robert|work=RobertFeder.com|date=December 8, 2017|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref> The sale was approved by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) on March 13, 2018,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=1775582|title=Application Search Details|work=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=March 16, 2018|accessdate=April 21, 2018}}</ref> and was completed on April 20.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101783547&formid=905&fac_num=12279|title=Consummation Notice|work=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=April 20, 2018|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}</ref>

==History==
WTTW first signed on the air on September 6, 1955, as a member station of [[National Educational Television]] (NET). The station was founded by a group of civic-minded Chicagoans, led by [[Inland Steel Company|Inland Steel]] executive Edward R. Ryerson. Channel 11 came to life during the first year of the inaugural term of [[Mayor of Chicago|Mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]]; Daley, Ryerson and businessman [[Irving B. Harris]] were responsible for creating WTTW, which began its life with studios and offices in Chicago's Banker's Building. It also had a 'working exhibit' facility at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in Chicago's [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. The WTTW call letters were chosen as the founders wanted the station to be Chicago's "<u>W</u>indow <u>T</u>o <u>T</u>he <u>W</u>orld". The station's transmitter was given to WTTW by the staff and management of the defunct [[Phonevision|KS2XBS]], a [[pay television]] station operated by [[Zenith Radio Corporation]] on VHF channel 2 that was forced to shut down as a result of [[CBS]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WBBM-TV]]'s relocation to that channel in July 1953.

Ryerson recruited a young communications lawyer, [[Newton N. Minow]], to join the station's board; Minow would serve as both [[chairman]] of the WTTW board and as Commissioner of the FCC under the administration of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. [[Irving B. Harris]], Henry W. "Brick" Meers, [[John W. McCarter]], Jr., Martin J. "Mike" Koldyke and Sandra P. Guthman have served as chairman of the board for the public broadcaster in subsequent decades. Guthman, a member of the [[Polk Brothers]] family of Chicago, is the current chairman of the board, having served in that post since October 2003.

Minow stated that the only really important decision that he made during his tenure as chair of WTTW was the recruitment of William J. McCarter, Jr. as president and [[chief executive officer]], a post which he held for 27 years. Having run public station [[WETA-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], McCarter—a decorated [[Korean War]] hero and a veteran television pioneer—got his start in the broadcasting industry as a cameraman for ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and then as a part of the [[Army-McCarthy hearings]] on [[Capitol Hill]]. McCarter developed the concept of the political [[Round table (discussion)|roundtable]] that is now a staple of television news.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} In non-commercial television circles, McCarter is referred to as the "architect" of [[public television]] (his friends know him as the man who kicked [[Bob Dylan]]—who was set to tape an episode of ''[[Soundstage (TV program)|SoundStage]]'' and was found by McCarter asleep on the couch in the room—out of his office, waking the bearded Dylan up and ushering him out of the office after McCarter returned from a meeting).{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

During the 1960s, WTTW aired educational programming during the daytime hours, showing programs produced under the auspices of Chicago Area Schools Television (CAST). Programs from "TV College", covering college subjects, were also shown on weekdays. Other afternoon shows included a locally produced series titled ''The Storyteller'', which featured a children's story presented weekdays at 5:30&nbsp;p.m., and was sponsored by the locally based [[Marshall Field & Company]] department store chain. On October 5, 1970, WTTW became a charter member station of the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]).

WTTW did not broadcast programming on Saturdays until summer 1972, when it began airing a limited schedule of programming on that day until 2:00&nbsp;p.m.; the station expanded its Saturday programming scheduled to a full broadcast day in 1974. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, WTTW was used during the overnight hours as a test vehicle in the development of [[stereophonic sound]] for television audio broadcasts.  On August 7, 1984, WTTW became the first television station in the United States to broadcast its entire schedule in stereo sound<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=WTTW Launches New Era in Stereo Broadcasting |magazine=Dial |location=Chicago |publisher=PBS |pages=39 |date=March 1985}}</ref> In 1981, the Chicago Educational Television Association founded ''[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]]'' magazine as the program guide for WTTW and WFMT; the publication was sold to a [[joint venture]] between Metropolitan Detroit Magazine and Adams Communications in 1986 for $17 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=THE CHICAGO MAGAZINE STORY HOW DEAL PUT DETROIT OUTFIT IN, LEFT OTHERS PUT OUT|author=Charles Storch|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|page=1|date=January 18, 1987}}</ref>

On November 22, 1987, WTTW's signal was [[Max Headroom broadcast signal intrusion|hijacked by an unknown person]] wearing a [[Max Headroom (character)|Max Headroom]] mask—the second such [[broadcast signal intrusion|signal interruption]] incident to occur in the Chicago area that night, with the first taking place during the 9:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast on [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WGN-TV]] (channel 9) two hours prior to the hacker's intrusion of the WTTW signal. While WGN-TV's analog transmitter was located atop the [[John Hancock Center]] at the time, allowing for engineers to almost immediately thwart the video hacker by changing the studio-to-transmitter frequency, WTTW's transmitter was located atop the Sears Tower (now the [[Willis Tower]]), which made it harder to stop the hacker before the interruption voluntarily concluded after almost two minutes.<ref name="interruptedtothemax">{{cite news|title=2 channels interrupted to the Max|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3857222.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106072747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3857222.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Don Hayner|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=Adler & Shaykin|id=CHI265386|page=3|date=November 24, 1987|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Philly>{{cite news|title=Bogus 'Max Headroom' Interrupts Broadcasts On 2 Chicago Stations|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB29DADD081E2CE&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=[[Knight Ridder]]|id=8703130089|page=C05|date=November 24, 1987|access-date=September 9, 2015}}</ref>

On June 4, 2010, Window to the World Communications announced that it would [[layoff|lay off]] around 12% of WTTW and WFMT's employee base and extend a salary freeze instituted in 2009 for one additional year, in an effort to cut $3 million in operating costs due to declining revenue, effects from the [[Great Recession|economic downturn]] and the loss of $1.25 million in grant money from the [[Illinois General Assembly]].<ref>{{cite news|title=WTTW, WFMT parent to cut 12% of staff, $3 million in costs|url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2010/06/wttw-wfmt-parent-to-cut-staff-by-12-percent-cut-3-million-in-costs.html|author=[[Phil Rosenthal]]|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=June 4, 2010|access-date=September 9, 2015}}</ref> Among the employees exiting WTTW in that layoff were Randy Chandler, Amy Christenson, Andy Fontana, Marc Glick, Susan Godfrey, Andrea Guthmann, Kari Hurley, Andre Jones, Shaunese Teamer, Sarah Warner and Tom Wuellner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-blogs/suntimes-cuts-jim-odonnell-from-sports-team/06db252a-67f7-402a-b197-84d289cd77e7|title=Sun-Times cut Jim O'Donnell from sports team|last=Feder|first=Robert|work=WBEZ 91.5 Chicago|date=June 16, 2010|access-date=December 8, 2017}}</ref>

On April 15, 2014, Window to the World Communications renamed the broadcasting facilities for WTTW and WFMT-FM as the Renée Crown Public Media Center, following a monetary gift of an undisclosed amount by the family of Renée Crown (wife of [[Lester Crown|Lester]]), who has served as a trustee for Window to the World since 1981).<ref>{{cite web|title=Renee Crown Media Center new name of WTTW building|url=http://reelchicago.com/article/renee-crown-media-center-new-name-wttw-building140407|author=Ruth L Ratny|website=Reel Chicago|date=April 7, 2014|access-date=September 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Window to the World is recipient of large Crown family gift|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2014/02/24/window-to-the-world-is-recipient-of-large-crown.html|newspaper=Chicago Business Journal|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=February 24, 2014|access-date=September 9, 2015}}</ref>

==Technical achievements==
WTTW has long been a pioneer in many technical aspects of television broadcasting, particularly in broadcast audio transmission. The station, in particular, participated in the trend of pop music-focused programs on television during the early 1970s (a few of which were also simulcast on local FM radio stations). When WTTW began production on ''Made in Chicago'', the station made the decision to transition from [[Monaural|monaural audio]] to stereo for the FM broadcasts. However, stereo recording equipment for television production did not exist at that time. Because of this, WTTW engineers chose to modify existing [[Ampex]] [[quadruplex videotape|quadruplex]] recorders to provide a stereo medium in sync with the video portion of the program. This innovation earned the station's staff a local Technical [[Emmy Award]] in 1973.

Further refinements to this system resulted in improvements to both frequency response and [[noise reduction]], and eventually led to the ability to edit stereo audio as the video was being edited electronically. [[Dolby Laboratories]] noise reduction technology (Type C, and then Type A) was introduced as the staff was driven to make improvements in the audio specifications. WTTW began syndicating ''Made in Chicago'' to other public television stations under the new title ''Soundstage'', with the first official taping of that program in June 1974 featuring [[Jim Croce]]. The station was broadcast in simulcast FM stereo—with [[WXRT]] (93.1 FM) and [[WBBM-FM]] (96.3) as participating stations—in the manner of its predecessor.

In 1975, WTTW management was approached by a startup company called Telesonics with an idea to develop an audio system for television broadcasts that used a mono-compatible, stereo audio channel. Around this time, the Sears Tower had been completed and WTTW became one of the first broadcasters to move its transmitter facilities atop the new building; WTTW had broadcast from a temporary antenna as the now familiar twin towers that adorn the top of the building had not yet been completed.<ref>[[Multichannel television sound#References]]</ref>

WTTW also plans to operate a [[Mobile television|Mobile DTV]] feed of subchannel 11.1, which will broadcast at 1.83 [[Data rate units#Megabit per second|Mbit/s]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mobile DTV Service List|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?request=atscmph|website=RabbitEars|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mobile DTV Station Guide|url=http://www.mdtvsignalmap.com|publisher=[[National Association of Broadcasters]]|accessdate=March 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017031109/http://www.mdtvsignalmap.com/|archive-date=October 17, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> WTTW's main channel and all of its subchannels are available on [[Comcast]] systems in the market.

In May 2015, WTTW downgraded the resolution of its main channel from [[1080i]] to [[720p]], which the station had previously transmitted its high definition content in prior to September 2009, during which time it downconverted HD content provided by PBS from their native 1080i format.

====WTTW-DT2====
From the sign-on of its digital signal in 2004 until 2009, WTTW branded its main digital channel on 11.1 as "WTTW-Digital", featuring a full schedule of programs available in high definition, while digital subchannel 11.2 rebroadcast the main programming schedule of analog channel 11. In September 2008, digital channel 11.1 was converted into a simulcast of the analog signal's programming, resulting in it carrying the same programming schedule as 11.2. On March 30, 2009, 11.2 was relaunched with a separate schedule as "WTTW Prime", which features a mix of PBS primetime programs and WTTW's locally produced programming—particularly during the period from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m., when children's programming airs on the main channel. WTTW Prime carries some PBS programs in their traditional timeslots (most notably, a block of the service's [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programs that run on Friday evenings and a daily airing of the ''[[Nightly Business Report]]'' at 5:30&nbsp;p.m.) WTTW Prime is also available on Comcast [[digital cable|digital]] channel 370.<ref>{{cite web|title=WTTW Prime Highlights|url=http://www.wttw.com/main.taf?p=2,10|website=WTTW|publisher=Window to the World Communications}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WTTW Schedules|url=http://www.wttw.com/main.taf?p=2,9|website=WTTW|publisher=Window to the World Communications}}</ref>

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WTTW shut down its analog signal, over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 11, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition [[UHF]] channel 47.<ref>{{cite web |title=DTV Tentative Channel Designations for the First and the Second Rounds |url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |publisher=[[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829004251/http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2013 }}</ref> Through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]], digital television receivers display the station's [[virtual channel]] as its former VHF analog channel 11. The "WTTW" callsign was also officially transferred from the now-defunct analog channel 11 to digital channel 47, with the "WTTW-DT" callsign used to identify digital channel 47 during the pre-transition era officially being discontinued.

==Programming==
Programming on WTTW is funded in part by financial support of viewers and by other not-for-profit organizations such as the [[Corporation For Public Broadcasting]]. WTTW carries programs distributed by PBS, [[American Public Television]] and other sources, along with airing several locally produced programs. WTTW also distributes several programs to [[public television]] stations independently of PBS, such as to American Public Television. In addition, WTTW is one of the few public television stations that regularly produce or present national public television programming. Its most prominent productions include political discussion program ''[[The McLaughlin Group]]'' and the music program ''[[Soundstage (TV series)|Soundstage]]''. WTTW has produced over 110 ''SoundStage'' episodes from its Chicago studios, the first of which featured Chicago blues legend [[Muddy Waters]] surrounded by his young proteges: [[Dr. John]], [[Junior Wells]], [[Mike Bloomfield|Michael Bloomfield]], [[Koko Taylor]], Rollo Radford, [[Buddy Guy]], [[Nick Gravenites]], [[Buddy Miles]] and his long-time collaborator, pianist [[Otis Spann]] among others.

WTTW also produced the popular cooking series ''[[The Frugal Gourmet]]'' during the 1980s. Other popular programs produced by WTTW for public television syndication have included the early art-video show ''Image Union''; ''[[CEO Exchange]]''; locally produced restaurant review show ''[[Check, Please!]]'' [[cooking show]] ''[[Mexico: One Plate at a Time]]''; travel show ''[[The Travel Detective]]''; children's programs ''[[Lamb Chop's Play-Along]]'', ''[[Kidsongs]]'', ''[[WordWorld]]'' and ''[[Nature Cat]]''; and the irreverent magazine series ''[[Wild Chicago]]''.

The most well-known program ever to have been originated by WTTW was ''[[Sneak Previews]]'', the first movie review show to air on television. It began in 1975 with film critics [[Roger Ebert]] (then a critic for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'') and [[Gene Siskel]] (then with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'') as its hosts and was later hosted by [[Michael Medved]], [[Neal Gabler]], and [[Jeffrey Lyons (television critic)|Jeffrey Lyons]] when Siskel and Ebert moved into [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] (starting the show ''[[At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert]]'' and later ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel & Ebert & the Movies]]''); ''Sneak Previews'' was cancelled in 1996. In January 2011, WTTW produced a new movie review program created by Ebert, ''[[Ebert Presents: At the Movies]]'', which was hosted by [[Christy Lemire]] and [[Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]], with Ebert himself hosting a segment called "Roger's Office"; the program lasted one season, before being cancelled due to funding constraints and the subsequent death of Ebert.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roger Ebert to appear on movie review show| url=http://www.wttw.com/main.taf?p=1,29,1,7|website=WTTW|publisher=Window To The World Communications|date=October 4, 2010|accessdate=October 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Roger Ebert reviving "At the Movies" on public TV|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68959T20100910|author=[[James Hibberd (writer)|James Hibberd]]|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|via=[[Reuters]]|date=September 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=See you at the movies|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/03/see_you_at_the_movies.html|website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] (Roger Ebert's Journal)|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|date=March 25, 2010|accessdate=March 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326033808/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/03/see_you_at_the_movies.html|archivedate=March 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Roger Ebert and PBS bring back 'At the Movies'|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/09/roger-ebert-and-pbs-bring-back-at-the-movies.html|author=Yvonne Villarreal|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=September 10, 2010|accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref>

Among its local programs, WTTW also produces the newsmagazine and analysis program ''[[Chicago Tonight]]'', hosted by [[Phil Ponce]]. The program began in 1984 as a half-hour panel interview program with local broadcast journalist [[John Callaway (journalist)|John Callaway]], but was later expanded to an hour-long show with the addition of various feature segments including arts and restaurant reviews. The series ''Chicago Matters''—which is underwritten by the [[Chicago Community Trust]]—is considered to perhaps be the preeminent local journalism collaboration in the United States, involving television, radio and print, and dialogue at the highest levels of articulation.

The station has produced hundreds of significant arts programs, highlighting the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] and the [[Ravinia Festival]]. In addition, WTTW features [[documentary film|documentaries]] hosted by [[Geoffrey Baer]], spotlighting the history and culture of various parts of the Chicago area. These programs' popularity has often resulted in a high volume of monetary pledges to the station. It also produces ''The Artsiders'', an arts-focused program produced by Kai Harding, Inc. and created by former [[Big Idea Productions|Big Idea]] director Chris Olsen.
