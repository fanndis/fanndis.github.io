'''Meghan Elizabeth Trainor''' (born December 22, 1993) is an American singer-songwriter and talent show judge. She rose to prominence after signing with [[Epic Records]] in 2014 and releasing her debut single "[[All About That Bass]]", which reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and sold 11 million copies worldwide, and drew criticism for its lyrical content. Trainor has released [[List of songs recorded by Meghan Trainor|three studio albums]] with the label and has received various [[List of awards and nominations received by Meghan Trainor|awards and nominations]], including the 2016 [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]].

Trainor became interested in music from a young age; she wrote, recorded, and produced three independently released [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] albums, ''Meghan Trainor'' (2009), ''I'll Sing with You'', and ''Only 17'' (2010). She began writing and producing songs for other artists in 2013. In 2015, Trainor released her [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] major-label debut studio album, ''[[Title (Meghan Trainor album)|Title]]'', which included the top-10 singles "[[Lips Are Movin]]" and "[[Like I'm Gonna Lose You]]", and debuted at number{{nbsp}}one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The single "[[No (Meghan Trainor song)|No]]" led her follow-up album, the [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] album ''[[Thank You (Meghan Trainor album)|Thank You]]'' (2016), both of which reached number three on the respective charts. Trainor created her third album with Epic, the [[electronic dance music]]-influenced ''[[Treat Myself]]'' (2020), as an attempt to adapt to ongoing musical trends. She followed this with the holiday album ''[[A Very Trainor Christmas]]'' later that year.

Womanhood, [[body image]], and [[empowerment|personal empowerment]] are frequently occurring lyrical themes in Trainor's music, which is influenced by the popular music of the 1950s, and blends the genres pop, R&B, [[doo-wop]], and [[blue-eyed soul]]. Outside of the music industry she has had voice roles in the animated films ''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'' (2017) and ''[[Playmobil: The Movie]]'' (2019) She served as a judge on the television talent show ''[[The Four: Battle for Stardom]]'' (2018) and currently is a judge on ''[[The Voice UK]]'' (2020). Trainor's accolades include a [[Grammy Award]], four [[ASCAP]] Pop Music Awards, and two [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]].
