'''''[[Friends of the Earth]], Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.''''', 528 U.S. 167 (2000), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that addressed the law regarding [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue and [[mootness]].

The Court held that the [[plaintiff]] residents in the area of [[South Carolina|South Carolina's]] [[Tyger River|North Tyger River]] had standing to sue an industrial polluter, against whom various deterrent [[Civil penalty|civil penalties]] were being pursued.<ref>{{ussc|name=Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.|volume=528|page=167|pin=|year=2000}}.</ref> Standing was properly based on the fact that the residents alleged that they would have used the [[river]] for recreational purposes, but could not because of the [[pollution]].

The [[defendant]] polluter also claimed that the case was moot because it had ceased polluting, and had closed the [[factory]] responsible for the pollution complained of. The Court noted that the polluter still retained its license to operate such a factory, and could reopen similar operations elsewhere if not deterred by the fine sought. Therefore, the case was held not to be moot.

The Supreme Court's majority in ''Friends'' ruled that plaintiffs did not need to prove an actual (particular) harm to residents. Writing for the majority, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] held that injury to the plaintiff came from lessening the "aesthetic and recreational values of the area" for residents and users of the river because of their knowledge of Laidlaw's repeated violations of its clean water permit.

In addition, the case held that a civil penalty could be enforced against an entity even though the interests protected were private.  The court agreed with Congress in holding that civil penalties in the Clean Water Act cases "do more than promote immediate compliance by limiting the defendant's economic incentive to delay its attainment of permit limits; they also deter future violations."{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The 7-2 decision was written by Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], and joined by Justices [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]], [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor|O'Connor]], [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]], [[David Souter|Souter]], and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]]. Stevens and Kennedy each filed a concurring opinion. Justice [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]] wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]].
