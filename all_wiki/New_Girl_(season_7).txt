|ShortSummary    = One month after getting married, Nick and Jess call Cece, Schmidt and Winston to inform them that they're being evicted by "Engram Pattersky", along with everyone else on the building. Jess tries to make everyone express their feelings about leaving the loft forever. Although the others have already let go, they see how much it means to Jess, so they go along with her activity, nostalgically going through old items and also trying things they have never done at the loft before. They then play ''True American: Packing Edition'', during which a flash-forward is shown of them and their kids playing the game. After the truck is loaded, Winston reveals that the eviction was an elaborate hoax: "Engram Pattersky" is an anagram for "My Greatest Prank". Nick and Jess decide to move anyway, and the group drive off.
