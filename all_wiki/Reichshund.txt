==Bismarck's dogs==
Germans became able to own dogs freely as a result of the democratisation following the revolution of 1848. Keeping dogs became increasingly fashionable as the 19th century continued, and people in public life often did so as part of their image.<ref name=Wippermann192>[[Wolfgang Wippermann]], "Biche und Blondi, Tyras und Timmy.

Accounts of the dogs' temperament vary. Some historians have regarded Bismarck's choice of the largest available breed and his habit of having a dog with him, which would disconcert foreign diplomats, as calculated demonstrations of power.<ref name=Wippermann192/> Former diplomat [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce, Viscount Bryce]] referred to the dog as "now and then growl[ing] and show[ing] its teeth in a threatening way",<ref name=Bryce152/> and diplomat and President of Japan [[Kijūrō Shidehara]] said in a speech that "the dog threatened to bite anyone who would provoke his master's displeasure."<ref>Quoted in Schlichtmann, p. 88.</ref> [[Robert K. Massie]] describes Tyras as "terrori[sing] the Chancellory staff" and writes that those who spoke with Bismarck were "advised to make no unusual gestures which Tiras might interpret as threatening."<ref name=Massie>[[Robert K. Massie]], ''[[Dreadnought: Britain, Germany, and the Coming of the Great War]]'', 1991, New York: Random House-Ballantine, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-307-81993-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=94LfKeiMTegC&pg=PT157&dq=Reichshund&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zm1kUenwJO-u0AHXzIHYBA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwATgK n.p.]</ref> On the other hand Tyras was said by one contemporary to have "never been guilty of any such ill-mannered act before" his celebrated misbehaviour,<ref name=Vizetelly/> and the English periodical ''[[The Spectator]]'' described him at the time as "a very quiet creature, with a most pacific reputation."<ref name=Spectator>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ctMhAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA781&dq=Reichshund&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IrRhUZnXC4nkiALypIHoDQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=Reichshund&f=false "News of the Week"], ''[[The Spectator]]'', volume 51, no. 2608, 22 June 1878.</ref>

==Public attention==
Bismarck's dogs came to the public's attention and began to be called 'Reichshund' after Tyras attacked the [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n chancellor, [[Alexander Gorchakov]], at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878.<ref name=Wippermann192/> In some accounts, he knocked him to the ground,<ref name=Vizetelly/><ref>William Beatty-Kingston, ''Men, Cities, and Events'', 2nd ed. London: Bliss, Sands, and Foster, 189?, {{OCLC|2271789}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=hLRiUdvWL-7FiwKToIFA&id=CNULAAAAYAAJ&dq=Reichshund&q=one+a+singularly+handsome+black+dog+named+Tyras%2C+after+the+old+original+%22+Reichs-Hund%2C+%22+of+world-wide+celebrity+in+connection+with+his+spirited+attempt+to+throttle+Prince#search_anchor p. 258].</ref> according to Massie after he raised his arm to make a point,<ref name=Massie/> but according to ''The Spectator'' after he had stumbled and Bismarck had rushed to aid him.<ref name=Spectator/> However, ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'' published a front-page poem describing him as having torn the envoy's trousers. Its title was "An den Reichshund" - "To the Dog of the Empire".<ref>"Man weiß, ... wie dir Rußlands Galahose ... zum Opfer fiel." - "It is known, ... how Russia's ceremonial trousers ... fell victim to you." ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'' 39, 25 August 1878.</ref><ref>Wippermann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gf8O_s-qKAUC&pg=PA193 p. 193], accepts this version of events and adds that Bismarck laughed and did not apologise.</ref> The poem misidentifies the offending dog as Sultan, who had already died.

The term Reichshund came to be used for Great Danes or similar dogs in general.<ref>For example: Carl G. Schillings, ''Mit Blitzlicht und Büchse: neue Beobachtungen und Erlebnisse in der Wildnis inmitten der Tierwelt von Äquatorial-Ostafrika'', Leipzig: Voigtländer, 1910, {{OCLC|313349454}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XTcPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA55 p. 55] {{in lang|de}}.</ref> In [[Nancy Mitford]]'s ''[[Wigs on the Green]]'' Eugenia's "enormous mastiff" is called the Reichshund "after Bismarck's dog".<ref>[[Nancy Mitford]], ''[[Wigs on the Green]]'', 1935, Repr. New York: Vintage, 2010, {{ISBN|9780307740854}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k7UcNUzo5SoC&pg=PA35 p. 13]; Lisa Hilton, ''The Horror of Love: Nancy Mitford and Gaston Palewski in Paris and London'', London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2011, {{ISBN|9780297859604}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4S-HwplX63gC&pg=PT61 n.p.]</ref>

Some of the statues of Bismarck in Germany depict him with a dog, for example [[Max Klein]]'s statue of him in [[Grunewald]], Berlin (1897; melted down during World War II and recreated by [[Harald Haacke]] in 1996), [[Adolf Lehnert]]'s statue of him in the Johannapark in [[Leipzig]] with a dog for whom Tyras II served as model (1895; destroyed)<ref name=Breitenborn111/> and the statue of a young Bismarck by [[Norbert Pfretzschner]] erected by members of the [[German Student Corps|student 'corps']] on the [[Rudelsburg]] at [[Bad Kösen]] in 1896 (destroyed; recasting erected in 2006) depicts him with attributes of a corps member including a dog for whom Tyras I served as model.<ref name=Wippermann192/> Late-19th century student corps members included keeping large dogs among their traditions.<ref>Barbara Krug-Richter, "Hund und Student – eine akademische Mentalitätsgeschichte (18.&ndash;20.
