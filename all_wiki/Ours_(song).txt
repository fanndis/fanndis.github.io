===Synopsis===
[[File:Taylor Swift - Ours (Music Video).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Swift in an elevator with co-workers in the music video for "Ours".]]
The video begins as Swift, dressed as an office worker, passes through the lobby to the elevator and greets the people she meets. As the elevator's door closes, Swift begins to sing, looking indolent and slothful, seeing the people surrounding her in the elevator. As the elevator reaches the thirteenth floor, people surrounding her start to exit, nudging her. Swift then walks in the office and sluggishly sits at her office desk while a man disturbs her. She then walks around the office to use the office's printer (which is first out of paper, out of toner, and then disappears altogether); waits for a man who is noisily drinking water at a water cooler in the staff room; and eats while two women laugh and talk about her behind her back. Later at her office desk, Swift takes a sticky note written by her and her boyfriend (portrayed by [[Zach Gilford]]) stating that they loved each other first. Swift turns on the computer, watching and smiling at various videos of her and her boyfriend. She takes a look at her watch and leaves the office in a better mood than when she arrived. Swift waits for a bus outside. On the bus, Swift watches more videos on a [[Sony Tablet S]] of moments with her boyfriend. The bus stops at the airport. Swift gets off and looks around. Her boyfriend then emerges from the sliding doors of the airport, revealing to the audience that he was overseas serving in the military. Swift breaks into a smile, drops everything that she is carrying, and runs into her boyfriend's arms. They embrace each other as the video ends.<ref>{{cite web|author=TaylorSwiftVEVO |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ34LlaIk88&ob=av2n |title=Taylor Swift – Ours |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2012-12-06 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref>

Sweet, with just the right tinge of bittersweet sadness for the [[country music|country]]-infused [[Pop music|pop]] story."<ref>{{cite web|last=Beard |first=Lanford |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/12/05/taylor-swift-ours-video-watch-here/ |title=Taylor Swift: watch 'Ours' video &#124; The Music Mix &#124; EW.com |publisher=Music-mix.ew.com |date=2011-11-23 |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref> To date, the video has more than 90 million views on [[YouTube]].
