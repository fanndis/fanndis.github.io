'''Oklahoma''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Oklahoma.ogg|ˌ|oʊ|k|l|ə|ˈ|h|oʊ|m|ə}})<ref>{{cite web |website=Dictionary.com |accessdate=August 10, 2007 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Oklahoma |title=Oklahoma }}</ref> is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[South Central United States|South Central]] region of the [[United States]],<ref name="regdiv" /> bordered by the state of [[Texas]] on the south and west, [[Kansas]] on the north, [[Missouri]] on the northeast, [[Arkansas]] on the east, [[New Mexico]] on the west, and [[Colorado]] on the northwest. Partially in the western extreme of the [[Upland South]], it is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|20th-most extensive]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|28th-most populous]] of the 50 United States. Its residents are known as Oklahomans (or colloquially "[[Okie]]s"), and its capital and largest city is [[Oklahoma City]].

The state's name is derived from the [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]] words {{wikt-lang|cho|okla}} and {{lang|cho|humma}}, meaning "red people".<ref name="Oklahoma's Name" /> It is also known informally by its nickname, "[[Sooners|The Sooner State]]", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date of lands in the western Oklahoma Territory or before the [[Indian Appropriations Act]] of 1889, which increased [[European Americans|European-American]] settlement in the eastern [[Indian Territory]]. [[Oklahoma Territory]] and [[Indian Territory]] were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16, 1907.

With ancient mountain ranges, [[prairie]], [[mesa]]s, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the [[Great Plains]], [[Cross Timbers]], and the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]], all regions prone to [[Supercell|severe weather]].<ref name="Oklahoma Terrain"/> Oklahoma is on a confluence of three major American [[cultural area|cultural regions]] and historically served as a route for [[cattle drive]]s, a destination for Southern settlers, and a government-sanctioned [[territories of the United States|territory]] for Native Americans. Twenty-five Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma.<ref name="languages"/>

A major producer of [[natural gas]], [[petroleum|oil]], and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and [[biotechnology]].<ref name="Oklahoma's Economy 1"/> [[Oklahoma City]] and [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their [[metropolitan statistical area]]s.<ref name="metros">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/CBSA-EST2006-01.csv |title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2006 |website=[[United States Census Bureau]] |format=csv |accessdate=September 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914155415/http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/CBSA-EST2006-01.csv |archivedate=September 14, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These cities, collectively known as the Oklahoma Metropolitan Corridor, are included in the [[Texas Triangle]] megaregion.

==Etymology==

The name ''Oklahoma'' comes from the [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]] phrase ''okla'' ''humma'', literally meaning ''red people''. Choctaw Nation Chief [[Allen Wright]] suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government on the use of [[Indian Territory]], in which he envisioned an all-Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Equivalent to the English word ''Indian'', ''okla humma'' was a phrase in the Choctaw language that described Native American people as a whole. ''Oklahoma'' later became the de facto name for [[Oklahoma Territory]], and it was officially approved in 1890, two years after the area was opened to white settlers.<ref name="Oklahoma's Name">{{cite web|title=Chronicles of Oklahoma |first=Muriel |last=Wright |publisher=Oklahoma State University |date=June 1936 |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v014/v014p156.html |accessdate=July 31, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013231154/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v014/v014p156.html |archivedate=October 13, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | year=2007| url=http://www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/stinfo2.html | title=Oklahoma State History and Information | website=A Look at Oklahoma | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation | accessdate=June 7, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060729003635/http://www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/stinfo2.html|archivedate=July 29, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Merserve |first=John |year=1941 |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v019/v019p314.html |title=Chief Allen Wright |website=Chronicles of Oklahoma |accessdate=June 7, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507052851/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v019/v019p314.html |archivedate=May 7, 2006 }}</ref>

===Climate===

[[File:Lightning over Tulsa cropped.jpg|thumb|Oklahoma's climate is prime for the generation of [[thunderstorm]]s.]]
[[File:OBU Campus oval fountain in 2011 snowstorm..JPG|thumb|Winter at the [[Oklahoma Baptist University]] campus]]

Oklahoma is in a humid subtropical region.<ref name="Climate of OK" /> Oklahoma lies in a transition zone between semi-arid further to the west, humid continental to the north, and humid subtropical to the east and southeast. Most of the state lies in an area known as [[Tornado Alley]] characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces [[severe weather]] (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth.<ref name="The Climate of Oklahoma"/> An average 62 [[tornado]]es strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information/extreme-events/us-tornado-climatology |title=Tornado Climatology |publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center |accessdate=October 24, 2006}}</ref>

Because of Oklahoma's position between zones of differing prevailing temperature and winds, weather patterns within the state can vary widely over relatively short distances, and they can change drastically in a short time.<ref name="The Climate of Oklahoma" /> On November 11, 1911, the temperature at Oklahoma City reached {{cvt|83|F}} (the record high for that date), then [[Great Blue Norther of November 11, 1911|a cold front of unprecedented intensity]] slammed across the state, causing the temperature to reach {{cvt|17|F}} (the record low for that date) by midnight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mesonet.org/index.php/news/article/november_11_1911_a_palindrome_to_remember |title=News &#124; November 11, 1911: A Palindrome to Remember |publisher=Mesonet |accessdate=February 6, 2013}}</ref> This type of phenomenon is also responsible for many of the tornadoes in the area, such as the [[Tornado outbreak of April 27–29, 1912|1912 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]] when a warm front traveled along a stalled cold front, resulting in an average of about one tornado per hour.<ref name="1912 tornadoes" />

The [[humid subtropical climate]] (Koppen ''Cfa'') of central, southern and eastern Oklahoma is influenced heavily by southerly winds bringing moisture from the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Traveling westward, the climate transitions progressively toward a [[semi-arid]] zone (Koppen ''BSk'') in the high plains of the Panhandle and other western areas from about [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]] westward, less frequently touched by southern moisture.<ref name="Climate of OK"/> Precipitation and temperatures decline from east to west accordingly, with areas in the southeast averaging an annual temperature of {{cvt|62|F}} and an annual rainfall of generally over {{cvt|40|in|-1}} and up to {{cvt|56|in|-1}}, while areas of the (higher-elevation) panhandle average {{cvt|58|F}}, with an annual rainfall under {{cvt|17|in|-1}}.<ref>[http://www.owrb.ok.gov/ Oklahoma Water Resources Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723021315/http://www.owrb.ok.gov/ |date=July 23, 2009}}</ref>

Over almost all of Oklahoma, winter is the driest season. Average monthly precipitation increases dramatically in the spring to a peak in May, the wettest month over most of the state, with its frequent and not uncommonly severe thunderstorm activity. Early June can still be wet, but most years see a marked decrease in rainfall during June and early July. Mid-summer (July and August) represents a secondary dry season over much of Oklahoma, with long stretches of hot weather with only sporadic thunderstorm activity not uncommon many years. Severe drought is common in the hottest summers, such as those of 1934, 1954, 1980 and 2011, all of which featured weeks on end of virtual rainlessness and highs well over {{cvt|100|F}}. Average precipitation rises again from September to mid-October, representing a secondary wetter season, then declines from late October through December.<ref name="The Climate of Oklahoma" />

The entire state frequently experiences temperatures above {{cvt|100|F}} or below {{cvt|0|F}},<ref name="Climate of OK">{{cite web |url=http://climate.mesonet.org/county_climate/Products/oklahoma_climate_overview.pdf |title=Oklahoma's Climate: an Overview |publisher=University of Oklahoma |accessdate=August 1, 2007}}</ref> though below-zero temperatures are rare in south-central and southeastern Oklahoma. Snowfall ranges from an average of less than {{cvt|4|in|0}} in the south to just over {{cvt|20|in|0}} on the border of [[Colorado]] in the panhandle.<ref name="The Climate of Oklahoma" /> The state is home to the [[Storm Prediction Center]], the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]], and the [[Warning Decision Training Division]], all part of the [[National Weather Service]] and in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/about.html |title=SPC and its Products |last=Novy |first=Chris |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=August 1, 2007}}</ref>

During the 19th century, thousands of Native Americans were expelled from their ancestral homelands from across North America and transported to the area including and surrounding present-day Oklahoma. The Choctaw was the first of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] to be removed from the [[Southeastern United States]]. The phrase "[[Trail of Tears]]" originated from a description of the removal of the [[Choctaw]] Nation in 1831, although the term is usually used for the [[Cherokee]] removal.<ref name=len_green>

Increased presence of white settlers in Indian Territory prompted the United States Government to establish the [[Dawes Act]] in 1887, which divided the lands of individual tribes into allotments for individual families, encouraging farming and private land ownership among Native Americans but expropriating land to the federal government. In the process, railroad companies took nearly half of Indian-held land within the territory for outside settlers and for purchase.<ref>{{cite web | first=Robert|last=Hamilton|url=http://itech.fgcu.edu/&/issues/vol3/issue1/united.htm|title= United States and Native American Relations | publisher=Florida Gulf Coast University| accessdate=August 1, 2007}}</ref>

Attempts to create an all-Indian state named ''Oklahoma'' and a later attempt to create an all-Indian state named ''[[State of Sequoyah|Sequoyah]]'' failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 eventually laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, which took place two years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.willrogers.com/new/articles/exhibits/Sequoyah_Centennial/Sequoyah_exhibit.html |title=Clem Rogers |publisher=Will Rogers Museum Association |accessdate=August 1, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520025331/http://www.willrogers.com/new/articles/exhibits/Sequoyah_Centennial/Sequoyah_exhibit.html |archivedate=May 20, 2007 }}</ref> On June 16, 1906, Congress enacted [[Oklahoma Enabling Act|a statute authorizing the people of the Oklahoma and Indian Territories]] (as well what would become the states of Arizona and New Mexico) to form a constitution and state government in order to be admitted as a state.<ref>{{USStatute|59|233|35|267|1906|6|16|H.R.|16946}}</ref> On November 16, 1907, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] issued [[Presidential proclamation (United States)|Presidential Proclamation]] no.

The new state became a focal point for the emerging [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]], as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth. Tulsa eventually became known as the "[[Oil Capital of the World]]" for most of the 20th century and oil investments fueled much of the state's early economy.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.tulsalibrary.org/tulsahistory/communities.htm#tul| title= Tulsa Area History |publisher=Tulsa County Library| accessdate=April 25, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070108010448/http://www.tulsalibrary.org/tulsahistory/communities.htm| archivedate = January 8, 2007}}</ref> In 1927, Oklahoman businessman [[Cyrus Avery]], known as the "Father of Route 66", began the campaign to create [[U.S. Route 66]].

Oklahoma also has a rich African-American history. Many Black towns, founded by the Freedmen of the Five Tribes during Reconstruction, thrived in the early 20th century with the arrival of Black Exodusters who migrated from neighboring states, especially Kansas. The politician [[Edward P. McCabe]] encouraged Black settlers to come to what was then Indian Territory. McCabe discussed with President Theodore Roosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma a majority-Black state.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

By the early 20th century, the [[Greenwood, Tulsa|Greenwood]] district of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] was one of the most prosperous African-American communities in the United States.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/review/VE1117786589.html?categoryid=32&cs=1| title= The Tulsa Lynching of 1921: A Hidden Story|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] | accessdate=June 26, 2008 | first=Steven | last=Oxman | date=May 30, 2000}}</ref> [[Jim Crow laws]] had established [[racial segregation]] since before the start of the 20th century, but Tulsa's Black residents had created a thriving area.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] after 1915. The [[Tulsa race massacre]] broke out in 1921, with White mobs attacking Black people and carrying out a pogrom in Greenwood. In one of the costliest episodes of racist violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ok-history.mus.ok.us/trrc/file1.pdf| title= Tulsa Race Riot, A Report by the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921, February 28, 2001 |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society | accessdate=June 10, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624204404/http://www.ok-history.mus.ok.us/trrc/file1.pdf |archivedate = June 24, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.<ref>{{cite web|first=Larry |last=O'Dell |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/K/KU001.html |title=Ku klux klan |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009193345/https://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/K/KU001.html |archivedate=October 9, 2008 }}</ref>

During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the [[Dust Bowl]], throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and [[northwestern Oklahoma]] were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States.<ref>{{cite web | date=August 5, 2005|url=http://www.ccccok.org/museum/dustbowl.html|title= 1930s Dust Bowl | publisher=Cimarron County Chamber of Commerce| accessdate=August 1, 2007}}</ref> Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl.

[[soil conservation|Soil]] and [[water conservation]] projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.<ref name="Oklahoma Terrain"/><ref>{{cite web|year=2007 |url=http://www.history.com/states.do?action=detail&state=OK&contentType=State_Generic&contentId=54146 |title=History of the States: Oklahoma, The Sooner State |publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] |accessdate=August 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010051625/http://www.history.com/states.do?action=detail&state=OK&contentType=State_Generic&contentId=54146 |archivedate=October 10, 2007 }}</ref>

In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive act of domestic terrorism in American history. The [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of April 19, 1995, in which [[Timothy McVeigh]] detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]], killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001.

As the lawmaking branch of the state government, it is responsible for raising and distributing the money necessary to run the government. The Senate has 48 members serving four-year terms, while the House has 101 members with two-year terms. The state has a [[term limit]] for its legislature that restricts any one person to twelve cumulative years service between both legislative branches.<ref name="Oklahoma Government 2"/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=U.S. Term Limits |accessdate=August 9, 2007 |url=http://www.ustl.org/leglong.html |title=Legislative Longevity Limits |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920054851/http://www.ustl.org/leglong.html |archivedate=September 20, 2007 }}</ref>

Oklahoma's judicial branch consists of the [[Oklahoma Supreme Court]], the [[Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals]], and 77 District Courts that each serve one county.

Thirty-nine Native American tribal governments are based in Oklahoma, each holding limited powers within designated areas. While [[Indian reservation]]s typical in most of the United States are not present in Oklahoma, tribal governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but are subject to the authority of the [[United States Congress]] to revoke or withhold certain powers. The tribal governments are required to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval.<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert|last=Henry| url=http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=61934| date=March 22, 1989|title= Oklahoma Attorney General's Opinions: Question Submitted by: The Honorable Enoch Kelly Haney, Oklahoma State Senate| publisher=The Oklahoma State Courts Network | accessdate=August 21, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Lindsay|last=Robertson|url=http://thorpe.ou.edu/guide/robertson.html| year=2001|title= Native Americans and the Law: Native Americans Under Current United States Law| publisher=[[University of Oklahoma]]| accessdate=August 21, 2007}}</ref>

During the first half-century of statehood, it was considered a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] stronghold, being carried by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in only two presidential elections ([[1920 United States presidential election|1920]] and [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]]). After the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]], the state turned firmly Republican. Although registered Republicans were a minority in the state until 2015,<ref name="voters">{{cite web | url=http://www.ok.gov/elections/documents/VRStatsbycountyjan152015.pdf | title=Registration by Party as of January 15, 2015 | publisher=Oklahoma State Election Board| accessdate=February 6, 2015}}</ref> starting in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]], Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates in all but one election ([[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]).

Generally, Republicans are strongest in the suburbs of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, as well as the Panhandle. Democrats are strongest in the eastern part of the state and [[Little Dixie (Oklahoma)|Little Dixie]], as well as the most heavily African American and inner parts of Oklahoma City and Tulsa. With a population of 8.6% Native American in the state, it is also worth noting most Native American precincts vote Democratic in margins exceeded only by [[African Americans]].<ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0508/10676.html Dems woo Native American vote]. [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]. Published 5/29/08.</ref>

Following the [[United States Census Bureau|2000 census]], the Oklahoma delegation to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] was reduced from six to five representatives, each serving one [[congressional district]]. In the current Congress, all of Oklahoma's entire delegation are Republicans.
