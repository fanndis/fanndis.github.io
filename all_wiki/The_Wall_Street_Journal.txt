==History==
{{Recentism|date=July 2020}}

===Beginnings===
[[File:The Wall Street Journal first issue.jpg|thumb|left|Front page of the first issue of ''The Wall Street Journal'', July 8, 1889]]

The first products of [[Dow Jones & Company]], the publisher of the ''Journal'', were brief news bulletins, nicknamed "[[flimsies]]", hand-delivered throughout the day to traders at the [[stock exchange]] in the early 1880s. They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the ''Customers' Afternoon Letter''. Reporters [[Charles Dow]], Edward Jones, and [[Charles Bergstresser]] converted this into ''The Wall Street Journal'', which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889, and began delivery of the Dow Jones & Company News Service via telegraph.<ref>Dow Jones & Co. Inc., [http://www.dowjones.com/TheCompany/History/History.htm "Dow Jones History – The Late 1800s"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060807214105/http://www.dowjones.com/TheCompany/History/History.htm |date=August 7, 2006 }}, Retrieved July 25, 2013.</ref>

In 1896, The "[[Dow Jones Industrial Average]]" was officially launched. It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. In 1899, the ''Journal''{{'s}} Review & Outlook column, which still runs today, appeared for the first time, initially written by Charles Dow.

Journalist [[Clarence Barron]] purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902; circulation was then around 7,000 but climbed to 50,000 by the end of the 1920s. Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting—a novelty in the early days of [[business journalism]]. In 1921, [[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]], the United States's premier financial weekly, was founded.<ref name="Crossen">Crossen, Cynthia. "[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118591182345183718.html It All Began in the Basement of a Candy Store] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007033228/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118591182345183718.html |date=October 7, 2008 }}", ''The Wall Street Journal'' (New York), p. B1, August 1, 2007.</ref> Barron died in 1928, a year before [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday]], the stock market crash that greatly affected the [[Great Depression in the United States]]. Barron's descendants, the [[Bancroft family]], would continue to control the company until 2007.<ref name="Crossen"/>

The ''Journal'' took its modern shape and prominence in the 1940s, a time of industrial expansion for the United States and its financial institutions in New York. [[Bernard Kilgore]] was named managing editor of the paper in 1941, and company CEO in 1945, eventually compiling a 25-year career as the head of the ''Journal''. Kilgore was the architect of the paper's iconic front-page design, with its "What's News" digest, and its national distribution strategy, which brought the paper's circulation from 33,000 in 1941 to 1.1{{nbsp}}million when Kilgore died in 1967. Under Kilgore, in [[1947 Pulitzer Prize|1947]], the paper won its first [[Pulitzer Prize]] for William Henry Grimes's [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing|editorials]].<ref name="Crossen"/>

In 1967, Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the United States ultimately placing its journalists in every major financial center in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], [[Australia]], and [[Africa]]. In 1970, Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers. Later, the name was changed to [[Local Media Group|Dow Jones Local Media Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dowjoneslmg.com/|title=Dow Jones Local Media Group, Inc.|publisher=Local Media Group}}</ref>

The period from 1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including "[[Factiva]]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal Europe]]'', the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes, [[MarketWatch]], and "WSJ Weekend Edition". In 2007, [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corp.]] acquired Dow Jones. ''[[WSJ.]]'', a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto090320082104328499 |title=WSJ magazine targets upscale market |date=September 3, 2008 |work=[[Financial Times]] |last=Edgecliffe-Johnson |first=Andrew |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929154941/http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto090320082104328499 |archive-date=September 29, 2011}}</ref>

===Internet expansion===
A complement to the print newspaper, ''The Wall Street Journal Online'', was launched in 1996 and has allowed access only by subscription from the beginning.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stulberg |first1=Ariel |title=Testing news paywalls: Which are leaky, and which are airtight? |url=https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/news-paywalls-new-york-times-wall-street-journal.php |work=Columbia Journalism Review |date=May 23, 2017}}</ref> In 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the ''Journal''{{'s}} print and online subscribers together in [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (North America)|Audit Bureau of Circulations]] statements.<ref>"The Wall Street Journal Announces New Integrated Print and Online Sales and Marketing Initiatives".

On November 30, 2004, [[Oasys Mobile]] and ''The Wall Street Journal'' released an app that would allow users to access content from ''The Wall Street Journal Online'' via their mobile phones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=131111&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=807942&highlight=|title=Oasys Mobile, Inc.

In September 2005, the ''Journal'' launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years. The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising.<ref name="Crossen"/>

In 2005, the ''Journal'' reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1{{nbsp}}million, and an average age of 55.<ref>Mitchell, Bill.

[[Poynter Institute|Poynter Online]], September 21, 2005.</ref>

In 2007, the ''Journal'' launched a worldwide expansion of its website to include major foreign-language editions. The paper had also shown an interest in buying the rival ''[[Financial Times]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wray|first=Richard|title=How the word on Wall Street will spread around the world|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=UK|date=February 1, 2007|url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2003063,00.html|access-date=February 3, 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203082414/http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0%2C%2C2003063%2C00.html|archive-date=February 3, 2007}}</ref>

Front-page advertising in the ''Journal'' was re-introduced on September 5, 2006. This followed similar introductions in the European and Asian editions in late 2005.<ref>"[http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/060718/102326.html Wall Street Journal Introduces New Front Page Advertising Opportunity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814030343/http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/060718/102326.html |date=August 14, 2006 }}". Press release, July 18, 2006. Retrieved August 19, 2006.</ref>

After presenting nearly identical front-page layouts for half a century—always six columns, with the day's top stories in the first and sixth columns, "What's News" digest in the second and third, the "A-hed" feature story in the fourth (with 'hed' being jargon for [[headline]]) and themed weekly reports in the fifth column<ref>[http://info.wsj.com/college/guidedtour/pageone.html WSJ.com Guided Tour: Page One], accessed August 30, 2007.</ref> – the paper in 2007 decreased its [[broadsheet]] width from 15 to 12{{nbsp}}inches while keeping the length at 22{{frac|3|4}}{{nbsp}}inches, to save [[newsprint]] costs. News design consultant [[Mario García (designer)|Mario Garcia]] collaborated on the changes. Dow Jones said it would save US$18{{nbsp}}million a year in newsprint costs across all ''The Wall Street Journal'' papers.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ahrens |first=Frank |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/11/AR2005101101551.html |title=Wall Street Journal To Narrow Its Pages |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 12, 2005 |access-date=August 19, 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724120700/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/11/AR2005101101551.html |archive-date=July 24, 2008 }}</ref> This move eliminated one column of print, pushing the "A-hed" out of its traditional location (though the paper now usually includes a quirky feature story on the right side of the front page, sandwiched among the lead stories).

The paper still{{when|date=January 2018}} uses ink dot drawings called [[hedcut]]s, introduced in 1979 and originally created by [[Kevin Sprouls]],<ref>[http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/journal/ "Picturing Business in America"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051105024706/http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/journal/ |date=November 5, 2005 }}, [[Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery]], Retrieved August 19, 2006.</ref> in addition to photographs, a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper. The ''Journal'' still heavily employs the use of [[caricatures]], including those by illustrator [[Ken Fallin]], such as when [[Peggy Noonan]] memorialized then-recently deceased newsman [[Tim Russert]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Noonan|first=Peggy|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121390975307189781.html|title=Tim Russert WSJ drawing|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 20, 2008|access-date=June 5, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926050219/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121390975307189781.html|archive-date=September 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bizbash.com/orlando/content/editorial/12186_caricaturist_captures_the_corporate_market.php Caricaturist Captures the Corporate Market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924092509/http://www.bizbash.com/orlando/content/editorial/12186_caricaturist_captures_the_corporate_market.php |date=September 24, 2009 }}, Biz Bash Orlando, August 11, 2008.</ref> The use of color photographs and graphics has become increasingly common in recent years with the addition of more "lifestyle" sections.

===News Corporation and News Corp===
On May 2, 2007, [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] made an unsolicited takeover bid for [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]], offering US$60 a share for stock that had been selling for US$33 a share.

In an editorial page column, publisher [[L.&nbsp;Gordon Crovitz]] said the Bancrofts and News Corporation had agreed that the ''Journal''{{'}}s news and opinion sections would preserve their editorial independence from their new corporate parent:<ref name="Crovitz">[[L.&nbsp;Gordon Crovitz]], "A Report to Our Readers".

A special committee was established to oversee the paper's editorial integrity. When the managing editor [[Marcus Brauchli]] resigned on April 22, 2008, the committee said that News Corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier. However, Brauchli said he believed that new owners should appoint their own editor.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120949530982953531.html |title=WSJ Editor's Resignation Is Criticized By Committee |author=Steve Stecklow |date=April 30, 2008 |work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=September 27, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918015011/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120949530982953531.html |archive-date=September 18, 2008 }}</ref>

A 2007 ''Journal'' article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long "expressed his personal, political and [[business]] biases through his newspapers and television stations". Former ''Times'' assistant editor [[Fred Emery (journalist)|Fred Emery]] remembers an incident when "Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing ''Times'' editor [[Harold Evans]].

In 2011, ''[[The Guardian]]'' found evidence that the ''Journal'' had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales. These inflated sales numbers then enabled the ''Journal'' to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did.

'''OpinionJournal.com''' is a [[website]] featuring content from the editorial pages of ''The Wall Street Journal''. It existed separately from the news content at '''wsj.com''' until January 2008, when it was merged into the main website.<ref>

In addition to editorials and columns from the printed newspaper, wsj.com carries two daily web-only columns:
*''Best of the Web Today'' by [[James Taranto]], the editor of OpinionJournal.com (no subscription required).
*''Political Diary'' edited by [[Holman W. Jenkins Jr]] and featuring [[John Fund]] (separate subscription required).

===''WSJ Noted.''===
On June 30, 2020, the ''Journal'' launched ''WSJ Noted.'', a monthly digital “news and culture” magazine for subscribers aged 18–34 years old in a bid to attract a younger audience to the ''Journal''. The magazine has a group of some 7,000 young adults who are invited to preview content, provide feedback, and join Q&As with Noted staff.<ref name="noted-nieman">{{cite news |last1=Laura Hazard |first1=Owen |title=The Wall Street Journal aims for a younger audience with Noted, an Instagram-heavy news and culture magazine |url=https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/the-wall-street-journal-aims-for-a-younger-audience-with-noted-an-instagram-heavy-news-and-culture-magazine/ |access-date=July 14, 2020 |publisher=Nieman Lab |date=June 30, 2020}}</ref>

==Editorial board==
'''''The Wall Street Journal'' editorial board''' members oversee the ''Journal's'' editorial page and represent the newspaper and its editorial page publicly. ''The Wall Street Journal'' does not provide details on the exact duties of board members.

Every Saturday and Sunday, three editorial page writers and host [[Paul Gigot]], editor of the Editorial Page, appear on [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[Journal Editorial Report]]'' to discuss current issues with a variety of guests. As editors of the editorial page, [[Vermont C. Royster]] (served 1958–1971) and [[Robert L. Bartley]] (served 1972–2000) were especially influential in providing a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative interpretation]] of the news on a daily basis.<ref name=vetter>Richard Vetter, "Wall Street Journal", in Bruce Frohnen, ed. '' American Conservatism'' (2006), pp. 898–99.</ref>

==Editorial page and political stance==
The ''Journal'' won its first two Pulitzer Prizes for editorial writing in 1947 and 1953. Subsequent Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded for editorial writing to [[Robert L. Bartley]] in 1980 and [[Joseph Rago]] in 2011; for criticism to [[Manuela Hoelterhoff]] in 1983 and [[Joe Morgenstern]] in 2005; and for commentary to [[Vermont Royster]] in 1984, [[Paul Gigot]] in 2000, [[Dorothy Rabinowitz]] in 2001, [[Bret Stephens]] in 2013, and [[Peggy Noonan]] in 2017.

The ''Journal'' describes the history of its editorials:
{{quote|They are united by the mantra "free markets and free people", the principles, if you will, marked in the watershed year of 1776 by [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[American Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]''. So over the past century and into the next, the ''Journal'' stands for [[free trade]] and [[sound money]]; against confiscatory taxation and the [[ukase]]s of kings and other [[collectivism|collectivists]]; and for individual autonomy against dictators, bullies and even the [[Tyranny of the majority|tempers of momentary majorities]]. If these principles sound unexceptionable in theory, applying them to current issues is often unfashionable and controversial.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}}}

Its historical position was much the same. As former editor [[William H. Grimes]] wrote in 1951:
{{quote|On our editorial page we make no pretense of walking down the middle of the road. Our comments and interpretations are made from a definite point of view. We believe in the individual, in his wisdom and his decency. We oppose all infringements on individual rights, whether they stem from attempts at private monopoly, labor union monopoly or from an overgrowing government. People will say we are conservative or even reactionary. We are not much interested in labels but if we were to choose one, we would say we are radical. Just as radical as the Christian doctrine.<ref>{{cite news|last=Grimes|first=William H.|title=A Newspaper's Philosophy|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 2, 1951|location=New York, NY}} seen in {{cite web|title=A Newspaper's Philosophy |url=http://www.dowjones.com/Products_Services/PrintPublishing/Grimes.htm |publisher=Dow Jones & Company |access-date=August 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716005137/http://www.dowjones.com/Products_Services/PrintPublishing/Grimes.htm |archive-date=July 16, 2007|year=2007}}</ref>}}

Each [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] the editorial page prints two articles that have appeared there since 1961. The first is titled ''The Desolate Wilderness'', and describes what the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] saw when they arrived at the [[Plymouth Colony]]. The second is titled ''And the Fair Land'', and describes the bounty of America. It was written by a former editor, [[Vermont C.

The editorial board has long argued for a pro-business immigration policy.

In a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and [[Jeffrey Milyo|Jeff Milyo]] argue the ''Journal''{{'s}} news pages have a pro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks.

They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's [[South Brunswick Township, New Jersey]], corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor John Bussey,<ref name="The Eye of the Storm"/> who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to [[CNBC]] as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the ''Journal''{{'s}} offices and filling them with dust and debris.

The ''Journal'' subsequently conducted a worldwide investigation of the causes and significance of 9/11, using contacts it had developed while covering business in the Arab world. In [[Kabul, Afghanistan]], a reporter from ''The Wall Street Journal'' bought a pair of looted computers that [[Al Qaeda]] leaders had used to plan assassinations, chemical and biological attacks, and mundane daily activities. The encrypted files were decrypted and translated.<ref>Cullison, Alan, and Andrew Higgins. "Forgotten Computer Reveals Thinking Behind Four Years of Al Qaeda Doings".
