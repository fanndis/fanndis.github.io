[[File:Iona Abbey, Entrance and St John's Cross. - geograph.org.uk - 113441.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Iona Abbey]] in Scotland was founded by [[Saint Columba]].]]
Presbyterian tradition, particularly that of the Church of Scotland, traces its early roots to the Church founded by [[Saint Columba]], through the 6th century [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]].<ref name="Atkins2016">{{cite book|last=Atkins|first=Gareth|title=Making and Remaking Saints in Nineteenth-Century Britain|date=1 August 2016|publisher=Manchester University Press|language=en |isbn=9781526100238|page=104|quote=For many Presbyterian evangelicals in Scotland, the 'achievements of the Reformation represented the return to a native or national tradition, the rejection of an alien tyranny that had suppressed ... Scotland's true character as a Presbyterian nation enjoying the benefits of civil and religious liberty'. What they had in mind was the mission established by Columba at Iona and the subsequent spread of Christianity through the Culdees of the seventh to eleventh centuries. For Presbyterian scholars in the nineteenth century, these communities of clergy who differed in organisation and ethos from later monastic orders were further evidence of the similarity between early Christianity in Ireland and Scotland and later Presbyterianism. This interpretation of the character of the Celtic Church was an important aspect of Presbyterian identity in global terms. At the first meeting in 1877 of the Alliance of the Reformed Churches holding the Presbyterian System (later the World Alliance of Reformed Churches), Peter Lorimer (1812-79), a Presbyterian professor in London, noted 'that the early Church of St. Patrick, Columba, and Columbanus, was far more nearly allied in its fundamental principles of order and discipline to the Presbyterian than to the Episcopalian Churches of modern times'.}}</ref><ref name="TaylorAnderson1852">{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=James |last2=Anderson|first2=John |title=The Pictorial History of Scotland|year=1852|language=en|page=51|quote=The zealous Presbyterian maintains, that the church established by Columba was formed on a Presbyterian model, and that it recognized the great principle of clerical equality.}}</ref><ref name="Bradley2013">{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Ian|title=Columba|date=24 July 2013|publisher=Wild Goose Publications|language=en|isbn=9781849522724|page=29|quote=Columba has found favour with enthusiasts for all things Celtic and with those who have seen him as establishing a proto-Presbyterian church clearly distinguishable from the episcopally goverened church favoured by Rome-educated Bishop Ninian.}}</ref> Tracing their apostolic origin to [[John the Apostle|Saint John]],<ref name="DickensLewis1920">{{cite journal|last=Dickens-Lewis|first=W.F.|year=1920|title=Apostolicity of Presbyterianism: Ancient Culdeeism and Modern Presbyterianism|journal=The Presbyterian Magazine|publisher=[[Presbyterian Church (USA)]]|volume=26|issue=1–7|page=529|quote=The Culdees who claimed at the Synod of Whitby apostolic descent from St. John, as against the Romish claim of the authority of St. Peter, retired into Scotland.}}</ref><ref name="Thomson1896">{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=Thomas|title=A History of the Scottish People from the Earliest Times|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistoryscottis00annagoog|year=1896|publisher=Blackie|language=en|page=[https://archive.org/details/ahistoryscottis00annagoog/page/n181 141]|quote=...for the primitive apostolic church which St. John had established in the East and Columba transported to our shores.

Easter was kept at a different time from that of Rome. The tonsure of the monks was not, like that of Rome, on the crown, but across the forehead from ear to ear.

The Celtic Church was primarily monastic, and the monasteries were administered by an abbot. Not as organized as the church in Rome, it was a much looser institution. The Celtic Church celebrated Easter on a different date from the Roman, too. Life within the Celtic Church tended to be ascetic. Education was an important element, as was passion for spreading the word, that is, evangelism. The Celtic brothers led a simple life in simply constructed buildings. The churches and monastic buildings were usually made of wood and wattle and had thatched roofs. After the death of St. Columba in AD 597, the autonomy of the Celtic Church did not last long. The Synod of Whitby in 664 decided, once and for all, that Easter would be celebrated according to the Roman date, not the Celtic date.

[[File:John Knox statue, New College Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Knox]], who in 1559 returned from ministering in [[Geneva]] to lead the Reformation in Scotland.]]

While the Church of Scotland traces its roots back to the earliest Christians in Scotland, its identity was principally shaped by the [[Scottish Reformation]] of 1560. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}At that point, many in the then church in Scotland broke with Rome, in a process of Protestant reform led, among others, by [[John Knox]]. It reformed its doctrines and government, drawing on the principles of [[John Calvin]] which Knox had been exposed to while living in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. In 1560, an assembly of some nobles, lairds and burgesses, as well as several churchmen, claiming in defiance of the Queen to be a Scottish Parliament, abolished papal jurisdiction and approved the ''[[Scots Confession]]'', but did not accept many of the principles laid out in Knox's ''[[First Book of Discipline]]'', which argued, among other things, that all of the assets of the old church should pass to the new. The 1560 [[Scottish Reformation#Reformation Settlement of 1560|Reformation Settlement]] was not ratified by the crown, as [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary I]], a Catholic, refused to do so, and the question of [[Ecclesiastical polity|church government]] also remained unresolved. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In 1572 the acts of 1560 were finally approved by the young [[James VI]], but the [[Concordat of Leith]] also allowed the crown to appoint bishops with the church's approval. John Knox himself had no clear views on the office of bishop, preferring to see them renamed as 'superintendents' which is a translation of the Greek; but in response to the new Concordat a Presbyterian party emerged headed by [[Andrew Melville]], the author of the ''[[Second Book of Discipline]]''. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Melville and his supporters enjoyed some temporary successes—most notably in the Golden Act of 1592, which gave parliamentary approval to Presbyterian courts. James VI, who succeeded to the English throne in 1603, believed that Presbyterianism was incompatible with monarchy, declaring "No bishop, no king"<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Established Church of Scotland}}</ref> and by skillful manipulation of both church and state, steadily reintroduced parliamentary and then diocesan [[episcopal polity|episcopacy]]. By the time he died in 1625, the Church of Scotland had a full panel of bishops and archbishops. General Assemblies met only at times and places approved by the Crown. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

[[File:Reformed Scots Church Denominations.svg|thumb|right|upright=2.25| Timeline of the evolution of the churches of Scotland from the Reformation]]
[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] inherited a settlement in Scotland based on a balanced compromise between Calvinist doctrine and episcopal practice. Lacking the political judgement of his father, he began to upset this by moving into more dangerous areas. Disapproving of the 'plainness' of the Scottish service he, together with his [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[William Laud]], sought to introduce the kind of liturgical practice in use in England. The centrepiece of this new strategy was the Prayer Book of 1637, a slightly modified version of the Anglican ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. Although this was devised by a panel of Scottish bishops, Charles' insistence that it be drawn up in secret and adopted sight-unseen led to widespread discontent. When the Prayer Book was finally introduced at [[St Giles Cathedral]] in Edinburgh in mid-1637 it caused an outbreak of rioting, which, starting with [[Jenny Geddes]], spread across Scotland. In early 1638 the [[National Covenant]] was signed by large numbers of Scots, protesting at the introduction of the Prayer Book and other liturgical innovations that had not first been tested and approved by free Parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church. In November 1638, the General Assembly in Glasgow, the first to meet for twenty years, not only declared the Prayer Book unlawful, but went on to abolish the office of bishop itself. The Church of Scotland was then established on a Presbyterian basis. Charles' attempt at resistance to these developments led to the outbreak of the [[Bishops' Wars]]. In the ensuing civil wars, the Scots [[Covenanters]] at one point made common cause with the English parliamentarians—resulting in the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] being agreed by both. This document remains the [[subordinate standard]] of the Church of Scotland, but was replaced in England after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}O

Episcopacy was reintroduced to Scotland after the Restoration, the cause of considerable discontent, especially in the south-west of the country, where the Presbyterian tradition was strongest. The modern situation largely dates from 1690, when after the [[Glorious Revolution]] the majority of Scottish bishops were [[Nonjuring schism|non-jurors]], that is, they believed they could not swear allegiance to [[William III of England|William II]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] while [[James VII]] lived. To reduce their influence the Scots Parliament guaranteed Presbyterian governance of the Church by law, excluding what became the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]. Most of the remaining Covenanters, disagreeing with the Restoration Settlement on various political and theological grounds, most notably because the Settlement did not acknowledge the National Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant, also did not join the Church of Scotland, instead forming the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] in 1690. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Controversy still surrounded the relationship between the Church of Scotland's independence and the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of Scotland. The interference of civil courts with Church decisions, particularly over the appointment of ministers, following the [[Church Patronage (Scotland) Act 1711]], which gave landowners, or patrons, the right to appoint ministers to vacant pulpits, would lead to several splits. This began with the [[First Secession|secession of 1733]] and culminated in the [[Disruption of 1843]], when a large portion of the Church broke away to form the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. The seceding groups tended to divide and reunite among themselves—leading to a proliferation of Presbyterian denominations in Scotland.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}
[[File:Old logo of the CoS.png|thumb|right|upright|Older rectangular logo of the Church of Scotland.]]
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] passed the [[Church of Scotland Act 1921]], finally recognising the full independence of the Church in matters spiritual, and as a result of this, and passage of the Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925, the Kirk was able to unite with the [[United Free Church of Scotland]] in 1929. The United Free Church of Scotland was itself the product of the union of the former [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] and the majority of the Free Church of Scotland in 1900.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Some independent Scottish Presbyterian denominations still remain. These include the [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]—sometimes given the epithet [[Wee Free|The Wee Frees]]—(originally formed of those congregations which refused to unite with the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|United Presbyterian Church]] in 1900), the [[United Free Church of Scotland]] (formed of congregations which refused to unite with the Church of Scotland in 1929), the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] (which broke from the Free Church of Scotland in 1893), the [[Associated Presbyterian Churches]] (which emerged as a result of a split in the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland in the 1980s) and the [[Free Church of Scotland (Continuing)]] (which emerged from a split in the Free Church of Scotland in 2000).{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

[[File:NecTamenConsumebatur.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Stained glass showing the burning bush and the motto "nec tamen consumebatur", [[St. Mungo's Cathedral, Glasgow]].]]

The motto of the Church of Scotland is ''nec tamen consumebatur'' ([[Latin (language)|Latin]])—"Yet it was not consumed", an allusion to Exodus 3:2 and the [[Burning Bush]].

==Theology and practice==
The basis of faith for the Church of Scotland is the ''Word of God'', which it views as being "contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament". Its principal subordinate standard is ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith|The Westminster Confession of Faith]]'' (1647), although here liberty of opinion is granted on those matters "which do not enter into the substance of the faith" (Art. 2 and 5). (The 19th century Scottish distinction was between '[[evangelicals]]' and '[[Moderate Party (Scotland)|moderates]]'.) There is no official document in which substantial matters and insubstantial ones are clearly demarcated.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The Church of Scotland has no compulsory [[prayer book]], although it does have a [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland|hymn book]] (the 4th edition was published in 2005). Its ''[[Book of Common Order]]'' contains recommendations for public worship, which are usually followed fairly closely in the case of sacraments and ordinances. Preaching is the central focus of most services. Traditionally, Scots worship centred on the singing of [[Metrical psalter|metrical psalm]]s and paraphrases, but for generations these have been supplemented with [[Christian music]] of all types.<ref name="Bowden2005"/> The typical Church of Scotland service lasts about an hour. There is normally no sung or responsive liturgy, but worship is the responsibility of the minister in each parish, and the style of worship can vary and be quite experimental. In recent years, a variety of modern song books have been widely used to appeal more to contemporary trends in music, and elements from alternative liturgies including those of the [[Iona Community]] are incorporated in some congregations. Although traditionally worship is conducted by the parish minister, participation and leadership by members who are not ministers in services is becoming more frequent, especially in the Highlands and the Borders.

In common with other [[Reformed]] denominations, the Church recognises two [[sacraments]]: [[Baptism]] and Holy Communion (the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]]). The Church baptises both believing adults and the children of Christian families. Communion in the Church of Scotland today is open to Christians of whatever denomination, without precondition. Communion services are usually taken fairly seriously in the Church; traditionally, a congregation held only three or four per year, although practice now greatly varies between congregations. In some congregations, communion is celebrated once a month.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Theologically, the Church of Scotland is Reformed (ultimately in the [[Calvinist]] tradition) and is a member of the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]].<ref name="WCRC2018"/>

===Ecumenical relations===
The Church of Scotland is a member of ACTS ([[Action of Churches Together in Scotland]]) and, through its Committee on Ecumenical Relations, works closely with other denominations in Scotland. The present inter-denominational co-operation marks a distinct change from attitudes in certain quarters of the Church in the early twentieth century and before, when opposition to Irish Roman Catholic immigration was vocal (see [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Catholicism in Scotland]]). The Church of Scotland is a member of the [[World Council of Churches]], the [[Conference of European Churches]], the [[Community of Protestant Churches in Europe]], and the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]. The Church of Scotland is a member of [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]] and, through its Presbytery of England, is a member of [[Churches Together in England]]. The Church of Scotland continues to foster relationships with other Presbyterian denominations in Scotland even where agreement is difficult.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In May 2016 the Church of Scotland ratified the Columba Agreement (approved by the Church of England's General Synod in February 2016), calling for the two churches to work more closely together on matters of common interest.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==="God's Invitation"===
While the Bible is the basis of faith of the Church of Scotland, and the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] is the subordinate standard,<ref>''Ordinal and Service Book'', Open University Press 1931</ref><ref>[http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about_us/our_faith/westminster_confession_of_faith Westminster Confession of Faith] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022093419/http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about_us/our_faith/westminster_confession_of_faith |date=22 October 2016 }} page at Church of Scotland website</ref> a request was presented to a General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for a statement explaining the historic Christian faith in [[jargon]]-free non-theological language.

Between 1966 and 2006, the number of members fell from over 1,230,000 to 504,000,<ref>Church of Scotland 2007–2008 Year Book, p. 350</ref> reducing further to 446,000 in 2010<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/6000/ga11_legalq_app.pdf|title=church of scotland statistics 1999 - 2010}}</ref> and 352,912 by yearend 2015.<ref name="scotsman.com" /> The Scottish Church Census reported that only around 137,000 people worship on an average Sunday in a Church of Scotland, approximately 41% of the stated membership. On current rates of decline, the Church of Scotland has less than 25 years of existence left.

In April 2016 the Scottish Social Attitudes survey showed just 20% claiming to belong to the Church of Scotland; down from 35% in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-35953639|title=Most people in Scotland 'not religious'|date=3 April 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The church faces a £5.7 million deficit, and the costly upkeep of many older ecclesiastical buildings. In response the church has decided to 'prune to grow', reducing ministry provision plans from 1,234 to 1,000 funded posts (1,075 established FTE posts, of which 75 will be vacant at any one time) supported by a variety of voluntary and part-time ministries. At the same time the number of candidates accepted for full-time ministry has reduced from 24 (2005) to 8 (2009).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/3457/ga10_reports_ministries.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115119/http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/3457/ga10_reports_ministries.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> Since 2014, the number of full-time candidates accepted into training each year has been in the range of 13 to 16. At the 2016 General Assembly the Moderator pointed to issues such as: 25% of charges without a minister; all but two ministers over the age of 30; falling clergy numbers over the coming six years (anticipated that for each newly recruited minister there will be four retirements).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/21079/Friday_Afternooon_Reflection.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912071829/http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/21079/Friday_Afternooon_Reflection.pdf |archive-date=12 September 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

This lack of those in training towards ministry has threatened the viability of the Kirk's theological training colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scottishchristian.com/kirks-college-of-divinity-has-so-few-students-it-is-scarcely-viable/|title=Kirk's College of Divinity has so few students it is 'scarcely viable'|accessdate=22 February 2018}}</ref> During the 2019 General Assembly, the Ministries Council announced that they were looking to reduce the number of Academic Partners who train current ministry students from five, to either one or two. The five current academic partners are [[University of Glasgow]], [[University of Edinburgh]], [[University of Aberdeen]], [[University of St Andrews]] and, most recently, [[Highland Theological College]].

In 2018, the Ministries Council predicted, that on current trends, the Church of Scotland would have only 611 Full-Time Equivalent Ministers in post due to the age profile of the ministry, and the shortfall in new candidates, down from the 775 in post at that time. This would result in some Presbyteries likely to have less than half of their positions filled.

=== Women's ordination ===
{{Main|Ordination of women in the Church of Scotland}}
Since 1968, all ministries and offices in the church have been open to women and men on an equal basis. In 2004, [[Alison Elliot]] was chosen to be Moderator of the General Assembly, the first woman in the post and the first non-minister to be chosen since [[George Buchanan (humanist)|George Buchanan]], four centuries before. In May 2007 the Rev [[Sheilagh M. Kesting]] became the first female minister to be Moderator. There are currently 218 serving female ministers, with 677 male ministers.

=== Human sexuality ===
There is a division in the Church of Scotland on how the issues surrounding [[LGBT]] sexuality should be addressed. Currently, the Kirk allows pastors to enter into same-sex marriages and civil partnerships while also defining marriage as between a man and a woman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/news_and_events/news/recent/general_assembly_allows_ministers_and_deacons_in_same-sex_marriages|title=General Assembly allows ministers and deacons in same-sex marriages|last=Scotland|first=The Church of|date=24 April 2017|website=www.churchofscotland.org.uk|language=en|accessdate=24 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502090830/http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/news_and_events/news/recent/general_assembly_allows_ministers_and_deacons_in_same-sex_marriages|archive-date=2 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> This division of approach is illustrated by opposition to an attempt to install as minister an openly homosexual man who intends to live with his partner once appointed to his post.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2009/05/presbyterians_prepare_for_a_th.html|title=BBC - Will & Testament: Presbyterians prepare for a theological battle|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> In a landmark decision, the General Assembly (GA) voted on 23 May 2009 by 326 to 267 to ratify the appointment of the Reverend [[Scott Rennie]], the Kirk's first out, non-celibate gay minister. The decision was reached on the basis the presbytery had followed the correct procedure. Rennie had won the overwhelming support of his prospective church members at Queen's Cross, Aberdeen, but his appointment was in some doubt until extensive debate and this vote by the commissioners to the assembly. The GA later agreed upon a moratorium on the appointment of further non-celibate gay people until after a special commission has reported on the matter.<ref>[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.2510044.0.0.php Church backs first openly gay minister – Herald Scotland<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527082737/http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.2510044.0.0.php |date=27 May 2009 }}</ref> (See: [[LGBT clergy in Christianity]])

As a result of these developments, a new grouping of congregations within the church was begun "to declare their clear commitment to historic Christian orthodoxy", known as the [[Fellowship of Confessing Churches]].<ref>[http://www.confessingchurch.org.uk/membership/member-churches/ Member Churches] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007235633/http://www.confessingchurch.org.uk/membership/member-churches/ |date=7 October 2011 }} confessingchurch.org.uk, accessed 7 July 2009</ref> In May 2011, the GA of the Church of Scotland voted to appoint a theological commission, with a view to fully investigating the matter, reporting to the General Assembly of 2013.

==="The Inheritance of Abraham: A Report on the 'Promised' Land"===
In April 2013, the church published a report entitled "The Inheritance of Abraham: A Report on the 'Promised' Land" which included a discussion of Israeli and Jewish claims to the [[Land of Israel]]. The report said "there has been a widespread assumption by many Christians as well as many Jewish people that the Bible supports an essentially Jewish state of Israel. This raises an increasing number of difficulties and current Israeli policies regarding the Palestinians have sharpened this questioning", and that "promises about the Land of Israel were never intended to be taken literally". The church responded to criticism by saying that "The Church has never and is not now denying Israel's right to exist; on the contrary, it is questioning the policies that continue to keep peace a dream in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. This report is against the injustices levelled against the Palestinian people and how land is shared. It is also a reflection of the use or misuse of scripture to claim divine right to land by any group" and says it must "refute claims that scripture offers any peoples a privileged claim for possession of a particular territory".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4378549,00.html|title=Israel condemns contentious Church of Scotland report|work=ynet}}</ref>

The [[Scottish Council of Jewish Communities]] sharply criticised the report,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scojec.org/news/2013/13v_cos/cos.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215052327/http://www.scojec.org/news/2013/13v_cos/cos.html |archive-date=15 December 2013 }} SCoJeC Rebukes Church of Scotland over General Assembly Report</ref> describing it as follows: "It reads like an Inquisition-era polemic against Jews and Judaism.

Reverend Sally Foster-Fulton, who served as the Convener of the [[Church and Society Council]], defended the report, stating that: "This is primarily a report highlighting the continued occupation by the state of Israel and the injustices faced by the Palestinian people as a consequence. It is not a report criticising the Jewish people. Opposing the unjust policies of the state of Israel cannot be equated to anti-Semitism." In an interview with Iran's ''[[Press TV]]'', Reverend [[Stephen Sizer]] expressed support for the document, stating that "it's news that the Israelis don't want because they want to maintain the idea that they have the Church in their pocket."<ref>[http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/05/07/302307/new-report-questions-israels-claim-of-divine-right/ New report questions Israel's claim of "divine right"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508165509/http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/05/07/302307/new-report-questions-israels-claim-of-divine-right/ |date=8 May 2013 }}, ''[[Press TV]]'', 7 May 2013.</ref>

[[Dennis Prager]] criticized the church, writing that the document was "profoundly anti-Semitic" and "an act of theological forgery; it makes a mockery of the Bible as a coherent document and it renders Christianity inherently anti-Semitic" by "invalidating the Jewish people and invalidating the Jews' historically incontestable claims to the land upon which the only independent states that ever existed were Jewish".<ref>"[http://townhall.com/columnists/dennisprager/2013/05/14/the-church-of-scotlands-scandal-n1594126/page/full The Church of Scotland's Scandal]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075300/http://townhall.com/columnists/dennisprager/2013/05/14/the-church-of-scotlands-scandal-n1594126/page/full |date=4 March 2016 }} by [[Dennis Prager]], [[Townhall.com]], 14 May 2013.</ref>

In response to criticism, the church quickly replaced the original version with a modified one, stating that criticism of Israel's policies toward the Palestinians "should not be misunderstood as questioning the right of the State of Israel to exist".<ref>"[http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/church-of-scotland-thinks-twice-grants-israel-the-right-to-exist/2013/05/12/ Church of Scotland Thinks Twice, Grants Israel the Right to Exist]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128122301/http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/church-of-scotland-thinks-twice-grants-israel-the-right-to-exist/2013/05/12/ |date=28 November 2014 }}, ''[[The Jewish Press]]'', 12 May 2013.</ref>

===Life Issues===
The Church of Scotland is generally [[anti-abortion]], stating that it should be allowed "only on grounds that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve serious risk to the life or grave injury to the health, whether physical or mental, of the pregnant woman."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christian.org.uk/briefingpapers/abortion.htm|title=Apologetics - Sanctity of Life - Abortion|work=christian.org.uk|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928105058/http://www.christian.org.uk/briefingpapers/abortion.htm|archive-date=28 September 2011}}</ref>

The Church of Scotland also opposes [[euthanasia]]: "The General Assembly has consistently stated that: 'the Christian recognises no right to dispose of his own life even although he may regard those who commit or may attempt to commit suicide with compassion and understanding rather than condemnation'. The Church has frequently stressed its opposition to various attempts to introduce legislation to permit euthanasia, even under strictly controlled circumstances as incompatible with Christianity." The church is associated with the [[Care Not Killing]] organisation in "Promoting more and better palliative care./ Ensuring that existing laws against euthanasia and assisted suicide are not weakened or repealed during the lifetime of the current Parliament./ Influencing the balance of public opinion further against any weakening of the law."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/speak_out/social_issues/end_of_life|title=End of life issues|work=churchofscotland.org.uk}}</ref>

Historically, the Church of Scotland supported the death penalty; the General Assembly once called for the "vigorous execution" of [[Thomas Aikenhead]], who was found guilty of [[blasphemy]] in 1696.<ref name=Hill>Andrew Hill [http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/thomasaikenhead.html Thomas Aikenhead] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001011446/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/thomasaikenhead.html |date=1 October 2011 }} Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography monograph at website of Unitarian Universalist Association, c.1999</ref> Nowadays, the Kirk strongly disapproves of the death penalty: "The Church of Scotland affirms that capital punishment is always and wholly unacceptable and does not provide an answer even to the most heinous of crimes. It commits itself to working with other churches and agencies to advance this understanding, oppose death sentences and executions and promote the cause of abolition of the death penalty worldwide."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/speak_out/social_issues/criminal_justice|title=Criminal justice|work=churchofscotland.org.uk}}</ref>

The Church of Scotland does not consider marriage to be a sacrament, and thus not binding forever, and has no moral objection to the remarriage of divorced persons. The minister who is asked to perform a ceremony for someone who has a prior spouse living may inquire for the purpose of ensuring that the problems which led to the divorce do not recur.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/2449/guide_marriage.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 April 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404195306/http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/2449/guide_marriage.pdf |archive-date=4 April 2016 }}</ref>

Along ethnic or racial lines, the Church of Scotland was in historic times, and has remained at present, overwhelmingly white or light-skinned in membership, as have been other branches of Scottish Christianity. According to the 2011 census, among respondents who identified with the Kirk, 96% are white Scots, 3% are other white people, and 1% is either ethnically mixed; Asian, Asian Scottish or Asian British; African; Caribbean or black; or from other ethnic groups.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Scotland's Census 2011|title=Table LC2201SC - Ethnic group by religion|publisher=National Records of Scotland|type=Spreadsheet}}</ref>

The Kirk is committed to its 'distinctive call and duty to bring the ordinances of religion to the people in every parish of Scotland through a territorial ministry' (Article 3 of its ''[[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland|Articles Declaratory]]''). This means the Kirk in practice maintains a presence in every community in Scotland. The Kirk also pools its resources to ensure continuation of this presence.

The Kirk played a leading role in providing [[Universal education|universal]] [[education in Scotland]] (the first such provision in the modern world), largely due to its teaching that all should be able to read the Bible. Today it does not operate schools, as these were transferred to the state in the latter half of the 19th century.

==Governance and administration==
{{see also|List of Church of Scotland parishes|List of Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries|Presbyterian church governance}}

The Church of Scotland is [[Presbyterian]] in polity and [[Reformed]] in theology. The most recent articulation of its legal position, the ''[[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland|Articles Declaratory]]'' (1921), spells out the key concepts.

===Courts and assemblies===
As a Presbyterian church, the Kirk has no bishops but is rather governed by elders and ministers (collectively called presbyters) sitting in a series of courts. Each congregation is led by a [[Kirk Session]]. The Kirk Sessions in turn are answerable to regional [[Presbyterian polity#Presbytery|presbyteries]] (of which the Kirk currently has [[List of Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries|over 40]]). The supreme body is the annual [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]], which meets each May in [[Edinburgh]].

===Moderator===
Each court is convened by the '[[Moderators and clerks in the Church of Scotland|moderator]]'—at the local level of the Kirk Session normally the parish minister who is ''ex officio'' member and Moderator of the Session. Congregations where there is no minister, or where the minister is incapacitated may be moderated by a specially trained elder. Presbyteries and the General Assembly elect a moderator each year. The [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Moderator of the General Assembly]] serves for the year as the public representative of the Church, but beyond that enjoys no special powers or privileges and is in no sense the leader or official spokesperson of the Kirk. At all levels, moderators may be either elders or ministers. Only Moderators of Kirk Sessions are obliged to be trained for the role.

===Councils===
[[File:CofSBurningBushLogo.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Burning Bush]] emblem of the Church of Scotland, above the entrance to the [[Church of Scotland Offices|Church Offices]] in Edinburgh]]
At a national level, the work of the Church of Scotland is chiefly carried out by "Councils", each supported by full-time staff mostly based at the [[Church of Scotland Offices]] in Edinburgh. The Councils are:
*Council of Assembly
*[[Church and Society Council]]
*Ministries Council
*Mission and Discipleship Council
*Social Care Council ''(based at Charis House, Edinburgh)''
*World Mission Council

The Church of Scotland's Social Care Council (known as [http://www.crossreach.org.uk CrossReach]) is the largest provider of [[Social work|social care]] in Scotland today, running projects for various disadvantaged and vulnerable groups: including care for the elderly; help with alcoholism, drug, and [[mental health]] problems; and assistance for the [[homeless]].

The national Church has never shied from involvement in [[Scottish politics]]. In 1919, the General Assembly created a Church and Nation Committee, which in 2005 became the [[Church and Society Council]]. The Church of Scotland was (and is) a firm opponent of [[nuclear weapon]]ry. Supporting [[devolution]], it was one of the parties involved in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]], which resulted in the setting up of the [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1997. Indeed, from 1999 to 2004 the Parliament met in the Kirk's [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland|Assembly Hall]] in Edinburgh, while its own building was being constructed. The Church of Scotland actively supports the work of the [[Scottish Churches Parliamentary Office]] in Edinburgh.

Other Church agencies include:
*Assembly Arrangements Committee
*Committee on Chaplains to HM Forces
*Church of Scotland Guild
*Committee on Church Art and Architecture ''(part of the Mission and Discipleship Council)''
*Ecumenical Relations Committee
*Stewardship and Finance Department
*General Trustees ''(responsible for church buildings)''
*Legal Questions Committee
*Panel on Review and Reform
*Department of the General Assembly
*Safeguarding Service ''(protection of children and vulnerable adults)''

===Church offices===
{{Main|Church of Scotland Offices}}
[[File:Church of Scotland Offices, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Church of Scotland Offices, George Street, Edinburgh 2013]]
The Church of Scotland Offices are located at 121 [[George Street, Edinburgh]]. These imposing buildings—popularly known in Church circles as "one-two-one"—were designed in a Scandinavian-influenced style by the architect Sydney Mitchell and built in 1909–1911 for the United Free Church of Scotland. Following the union of the churches in 1929 a matching extension was built in the 1930s.

The offices of the Moderator, Principal Clerk, General Treasurer, Law Department and all the Church councils are located at 121 George Street, with the exception of the Social Care Council (CrossReach). The Principal Clerk to the General Assembly is the Rev Dr George Whyte. Each Council has its own Council Secretary who sit as a senior management team led by the Secretary to the Council of Assembly, currently the Rev Dr Martin Scott.
