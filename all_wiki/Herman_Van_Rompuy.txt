==Political career==

===Early career===
Van Rompuy was the chairman of the national [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian People's Party]]'s (CVP) youth council (1973–1977). From 1975 to 1980 he worked in the ministerial cabinets of [[Leo Tindemans]] and [[Gaston Geens]]. In 1978 he was elected a member of the national CVP's bureau (1978–present). He first was elected to the [[Belgian Senate]] in 1988 and served until 1995. In 1988 he briefly served as Secretary of State for Finance and for Small and Medium Enterprises before becoming the national chairman of the CVP (1988–1993).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Belgian Minister of Budget (1993–1999)===
Van Rompuy was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Budget from September 1993 to July 1999 in the two governments led by [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]]. As budget minister, together with finance minister [[Philippe Maystadt]], he helped drive down Belgium's debt from a peak of 135% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1993. It fell to below 100% of GDP in 2003.<ref name=bloomberg/>

===Member of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives (1995–2009)===
He was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in the [[1995 Belgian general election|1995 general election]], but as he remained a minister, he was barred from taking the seat while holding that office. After his party's defeat in the [[1999 Belgian general election]], he became a member of the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]]. He was re-elected in [[2003 Belgian general election|2003]] and [[2007 Belgian general election|2007]]. In 2004, he was designated [[Minister of State (Belgium)|Minister of State]].

====Position on Turkish accession to the union====
{{See also|Accession of Turkey to the European Union}}
Before he was President, Van Rompuy expressed reticence about possible Turkish membership of the EU. In 2004, he stated "An enlargement [of the EU] with Turkey is not in any way comparable with previous enlargement waves. Turkey is not Europe and will never be Europe." He continued "But it's a matter of fact that the universal values which are in force in Europe, and which are also the fundamental values of Christianity, will lose vigour with the entry of a large Islamic country such as Turkey."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=6O2IL32S&kanaalid=854 |title=De Standaard Online – Pers boos om 'anti-Turkse benoeming' |publisher=Standaard.be |date=21 November 2009 |accessdate=26 February 2010}}</ref>

As President, Van Rompuy has avoided opposing Turkish membership. On 23 December 2010, he said "Turkish reform efforts have delivered impressive results." He continued "Turkey plays an ever more active role in its neighbourhood. Turkey is also a full-standing member of the G-20, just like five EU countries and the EU itself. In my view, even before an outcome of the negotiations, the European Union should develop a close partnership with the Turkish Republic."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayszaman.com/sunday/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=230424 |title=Van Rompuy urges EU for closer partnership with Turkey |publisher=Today's Zaman |date=23 December 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212200109/http://www.sundayszaman.com/sunday/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=230424 |archive-date=12 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 28 December 2008, following the [[2007–2008 Belgian political crisis]], Van Rompuy was asked by [[Albert II of Belgium|King Albert II]] to form a new government<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews/idUSLS35202520081228|title= UPDATE 2-Belgian king asks Van Rompuy to form government – Industries – Financial Services & Real Estate – Reuters |accessdate=20 November 2009 |date=28 December 2008|first=Huw|last=Jones}}</ref> after he was reluctant to take up the role of Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE4BT3N020081230|title= FACTBOX – Key facts about new Belgian prime minister – World – Reuters |accessdate=20 November 2009 |date=30 December 2008}}</ref> He was sworn in as Belgian prime minister on 30 December 2008.

==== Taxes ====
On 13 October 2009 Bloomberg reported that the government of Herman Van Rompuy would seek to tax banks and nuclear power to tame the deficit.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=aWc3BM6JABEo|title=Bloomberg Article on Van Rompuy's positions as PM|accessdate=20 November 2009 |date=13 October 2009}}</ref>

==== Quote on financial recovery ====
"We are in the early stages of a recovery and at this time it is important not to weaken burgeoning confidence and to lay the foundations of a sustainable recovery" Van Rompuy said in a speech to parliament in Brussels. "Most important is to keep the direction. That will also provide stability and support."<ref name=bloomberg2>{{cite web|title=Belgium Will Tax Banks, Nuclear Power to Tame Deficit (Update2)|publisher=bloomberg.com |date=13 October 2009|accessdate=13 January 2010|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=aWc3BM6JABEo}}</ref>

==== Policy on government debt ====
On 13 October Bloomberg reported the following about {{lang|nl|Van Rompuy's}} Government Debt Policy: "Belgium will trim its budget deficit to 5.3% of gross domestic product in 2011 from almost 5.7% both this year and next, according to a slide presentation handed out by State Secretary for the Budget {{lang|fr|Melchior Wathelet}}. {{lang|nl|Van Rompuy}} told Parliament earlier today that the deficit would widen to 5.4% of GDP this year. Belgium's deficit will be little changed next year as the shortfall at the level of regional governments and municipalities will widen to 1.5% of GDP from 0.7%, offsetting efforts by the federal government to trim its deficit. Government debt will start exceeding one year's worth of national output {{As of|2010|lc=y}}, according to European Commission forecasts. Belgium had trimmed debt to as little as 84% of GDP in 2007, before bailouts of Fortis, Dexia SA, KBC Group NV and mutual insurer Ethias Group increased the nation's borrowing costs and inflated the debt ratio to 89.6% at the end of last year."<ref name=bloomberg2/>

==== Negotiations and dispute with GDF Suez ====
On 22 October 2009 Reuters reported that the {{lang|nl|Van Rompuy}} government had signed a commitment with GDF Suez for nuclear power fees to Belgium. The outstanding dispute with GDF concerns the €250 million fee that Belgium is attempting to charge GDF for 2009 as part of its "Renewable Energy Fund" as stated in the article: "Belgium has also charged nuclear producers a total of 250 million euros for 2008 and the same for 2009, as well as 250 million euros this year payable to a renewable energy fund. These fees remain in dispute. The producers are challenging the 2008 payment in Belgium's constitutional court. A spokesman for {{lang|nl|Van Rompuy}} said the government would pass a law to enforce the 500 million euro charge for this year, adding that this could also be contested by GDF Suez."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/utilitiesSector/idUSLM64184620091022|title= UPDATE 1-GDF Suez signs Belgian nuclear commitment – Reuters |accessdate=20 November 2009 |date=22 October 2009}}</ref>

On 19 November 2009, Van Rompuy was chosen unanimously by the European Council, at an informal meeting in Brussels, to be the first full-time [[President of the European Council]];<ref>{{cite web|title=President of the European Council factsheet|publisher= European Council |date=11 December 2009|accessdate=9 January 2010 |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/111298.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> for the period of 1 December 2009 (the entry into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]) until 31 May 2012. He took up his position officially on 1 January 2010.

Gordon Brown also praised Van Rompuy as "a consensus-builder" who had "brought a period of political stability to his country after months of uncertainty".<ref name="consensus">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8367589.stm|title=BBC News – Belgian PM Van Rompuy is named as new EU president|accessdate=20 November 2009 |date=20 November 2009}}</ref> This opinion is shared by others; he has been described as the painstaking builder of impossible compromises (''l'horloger des compromis impossibles'')<ref>Jean-Jacques Mevel, ''Van Rompuy, l'horloger des compromis impossibles'', in the daily newspaper, Le Figaro, 19 November 2009 {{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2009/11/19/01003-20091119ARTFIG00013-van-rompuy-l-horloger-des-compromis-impossibles-.php|title=online article (fr).|accessdate=21 November 2009}}</ref> A statement made by Van Rompuy at a news conference after his selection illustrates his approach: {{quote|"Every country should emerge victorious from negotiations. A negotiation that ends with a defeated party is never a good negotiation. I will consider everyone's interests and sensitivities. Even if our unity remains our strength, our diversity remains our wealth." He has also described his role of chairing a body composed of 27 heads of state or government (and finding consensus among them) as being "neither a spectator, nor a dictator, but a facilitator"}}

Being pro-Europe and opposed to far right, not all parties and factions had positive words for Van Rompuy when he took office. [[Nigel Farage]] attacked the freshly appointed president by saying, "You have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low grade bank clerk."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bypLwI5AQvY |title=Nigel Farage insults Herman van Rompuy, calls EU President a "DAMP RAG" – EurActiv.com |publisher=Youtube.com |date=24 February 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> He was fined €3000 (ten days' pay) for this statement by the Bureau of the European Parliament.

In a November 2009 press conference, Van Rompuy related to [[global governance]] by stating: "2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of a financial crisis; the climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzm_R3YBgPg |title=BBC – EU President Herman Van Rompuy on global governance and global management |publisher=Youtube.com |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> Van Rompuy referred to the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009]].

In or just before the first months of his presidency Van Rompuy visited all EU member states,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president/press-releases-%28new%29.aspx?lang=en|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100529181524/http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president/press-releases-(new).aspx?lang=en|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 May 2010|title=European Council President Press Releases|publisher=European Council|date=20 November 2009|accessdate=28 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president/the-president%27s-schedule.aspx?lang=en|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100529181502/http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president/the-president's-schedule.aspx?lang=en|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 May 2010|title=The President's schedule (archives)|publisher=European Council|accessdate=28 February 2010}}</ref> he also organised an informal meeting of the heads of state of the EU. The meeting took place on 11 February 2010 in the [[Leopold Park|Solvay Library]] (Brussels), topics to be discussed were the future direction of the economic policies of the EU, the outcome of the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen Conference]] and the then recent [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake in Haiti]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/App/NewsRoom/loadDocument.aspx?id=1&lang=en&directory=en%2fec%2f&fileName=112819.pdf|title= Invitation letter by Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, for the Informal meeting of Heads of State or Government|publisher=European Council|date=8 February 2010|accessdate=28 February 2010}}</ref>

In fact, the meeting was in part taken over by the growing sovereign debt crisis (at that time, Greece), which was to become the hall mark of Van Rompuy's first two years as President. With EU member states holding divergent positions on this issue, he had to find compromises, not least between France and Germany, at subsequent European Council meetings and summits of Eurozone heads of state or government leading to the establishment of the three-year [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM)and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF) in May 2010 to provide loans to Greece (and later Ireland and Portugal) to help stabilise their borrowing costs, but subject to strict conditions.

The European Council also gave him the assignment of chairing a task force on economic governance, composed of personal representatives (mostly ministers of finance) of the heads of government, which reported ahead of schedule to the October 2010 European Council. Its report, which proposed stronger macro-economic co-ordination within the EU in general and the Eurozone in particular and also a tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact was endorsed by the European Council. The latter also charged him with preparing, by December 2010, a proposal for a limited change to the Treaty required to enable a more permanent financial stability mechanism. His draft – for an addition to Article 136 TFEU, pertaining to the Eurozone – was endorsed by the European Council at its October 2010 meeting.

His second year in office, 2011, was also marked by a deterioration of the Greek debt crisis, leading to Van Rompuy calling an extraordinary meeting of the Eurozone heads of state or government in July to adopt a first package of further measures (notably longer term loans at lower interest rates, private sector debt-writedown, further fiscal consolidation in Greece) and again in October (in conjunction with full European Council meetings) to contain contagion from Greece to other countries (through bank recapitalisation across Europe and by leveraging the firepower of the EFSF to about €1 trillion).

His first two years were also marked by his role in co-ordinating European positions on the world stage at G8 and G20 summits and bilateral summits, such as the tense 5 October 2010 EU-China summit. He called a special European Council at short notice in early 2011 on the emerging Libya crisis, which, in agreeing conditions for military intervention, made it impossible for Germany to oppose such intervention once the conditions were fulfilled.

On 1 March 2012 Herman Van Rompuy was re-elected unanimously as President of the European Council by the heads of state or government of the 28 EU member states. President Van Rompuy's second term has lasted for two and a half years, from 1 June 2012 to 30 November 2014. After this second mandate he could not have been re-elected because the European Council President's term of office can only be extended once.

Herman Van Rompuy was also appointed as the first President of the Euro Summit, and this for the same term of office as his Presidency of the European Council. The Euro Summit meetings are to take place at least twice a year.

In 2014, Van Rompuy was awarded the [[Karlspreis|International Charlemagne Prize]] of [[Aachen]] for his EU role.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grybauskaite: responsible leadership strengthens Europe|url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/baltic_states/?doc=92217|publisher=The Baltic Course}}</ref><ref name="CharlemagnePrize">{{cite web |url=http://www.karlspreis.de/en/laureates/herman-van-rompuy-2014/biography |title=Charlemagne Prize Laureate 2014 Herman Van Rompuy |date=29 May 2014 |publisher=Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216154304/http://www.karlspreis.de/en/laureates/herman-van-rompuy-2014/biography |archive-date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref>

== President's cabinet==
Although the European Council is, under the terms of the Lisbon treaty, a separate institution of the EU, it does not have its own administration. The administrative support for both the European Council and its president is provided by the [[General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union]].

The president does have, however, his own private office (''cabinet'') of close advisers. Van Rompuy chose as his chief of staff (''chef de cabinet'') Baron Frans van Daele, formerly Belgian ambassador to, variously, the US, the UN, the EU and NATO and chief of staff of several Belgian foreign ministers. Also in his team are the former UK Labour MEP [[Richard Corbett]], former Hungarian Ambassador to NATO Zoltan Martinusz, former head of the EU's economic & financial committee Odile Renaud-Basso, [[Luuk van Middelaar]], his main speech writer, and Van Rompuy's long standing press officer Dirk De Backer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president/cabinet?lang=nl|title=Kabinet van Donald Tusk – Consilium|access-date=19 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203045127/http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president/cabinet?lang=nl|archive-date=3 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2013 Frans Van Daele retired both as a diplomat and as chief of Staff of Van Rompuy, and was appointed chief of staff to [[Philippe of Belgium|king Philippe]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Frans VAN DAELE|url=https://www.coleurope.eu/whoswho/person/frans.van-daele|publisher=College of Europe|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> He was succeeded as chief of staff of Herman Van Rompuy by Didier Seeuws.
