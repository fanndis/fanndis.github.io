In 2005, [[Kofi Annan]], then Secretary-General of the United Nations described the [[mass murder]] as the worst crime on European soil since the [[Second World War]], and in a message to the tenth anniversary commemoration of the massacre, he wrote that, while blame lay "first and foremost with those who planned and carried out the massacre and those who assisted and harboured them", the UN had "made serious errors of judgement, rooted in a philosophy of impartiality", describing Srebrenica as a tragedy that would haunt the history of the UN forever.<ref name="10thAnniversary" />

In 2006, in the ''[[Bosnian Genocide case]]'' held before the International Court of Justice, [[Serbia and Montenegro]] was cleared of direct responsibility for, or complicity in, the massacre, but was found responsible for not doing enough to prevent the genocide and not prosecuting those responsible, in breach of the [[Genocide Convention]].

== Background ==

=== Conflict in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
{{See also|Yugoslav Wars|Bosnian War}}

The multiethnic [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was mainly inhabited by Muslim [[Bosniaks]] (44 percent), [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]] (31 percent) and Catholic [[Croats]] (17 percent). As the former [[Yugoslavia]] began to disintegrate, the region declared national sovereignty on October 15, 1991, and held a [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina|referendum for independence]] on February 29, 1992. The result of that referendum, which favours independence, was opposed by the political representatives of the Bosnian Serbs who had boycotted the referendum. The [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was formally recognised by the [[European Community]] on April 6, 1992 and the [[United Nations]] on May 22, 1992.<ref>{{cite court |litigants= Prosecutor v.

Following the declaration of independence, Bosnian Serb forces, supported by the [[Serbian government]] of [[Slobodan Milošević]] and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), attacked the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to secure and unify the territory under Serb control, and to create an ethnically Serb state of [[Republica Srpska]] <ref>{{citation|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/acjug/en/krs-aj040419e.pdf |title=Prosecutor vs Radislav Krstic, ICTY Appeals Chamber Judgement |ref =Case No. IT-98-33-A|date=19 April 2004|at=Para. 15|work=International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 |access-date= 21 March 2011}}</ref>.

By April 1992, Srebrenica had became increasingly isolated by the Serb forces. On April 17, 1992, the Bosnian Muslim population of Srebrenica was given a 24-hour ultimatum to surrender all weapons and leave town. In April 1992, Srebrenica was briefly captured by the Bosnian Serbs, when it was retaken by Bosnian Muslims on May 8, 1992. Nonetheless, the Bosnian Muslims remained surrounded by Serb forces, and was cut off from outlying areas. Between April 1992 and March 1993, the [[Naser Orić]] trial judgement described the situation in Srebrenica as follows:<ref name="ICTY Naser Oric"/>{{rp|47}}

{{quote|Between April 1992 and March 1993, the town of Srebrenica and the villages in the area held by Bosniak were constantly subjected to Serb military assaults, including artillery attacks, sniper fire, as well as occasional bombing from aircraft. Each onslaught followed a similar pattern. Serb soldiers and paramilitaries surrounded a Bosnian Muslim village or hamlet, called upon the population to surrender their weapons, and then began with indiscriminate shelling and shooting. In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the population, who offered no significant resistance, and destroyed their homes. During this period, Srebrenica was subjected to indiscriminate shelling from all directions on a daily basis. Potočari in particular was a daily target for Serb artillery and infantry because it was a sensitive point in the defence line around Srebrenica. Other Bosnian Muslim settlements were routinely attacked as well. All this resulted in a great number of refugees and casualties.}}

During the first three months of war, from April to June 1992, the Bosnian Serb forces, with support from the JNA, destroyed 296 predominantly Bosniak villages in the region around Srebrenica, forcibly uprooted some 70,000 Bosniaks from their homes and systematically massacred at least 3,166 Bosniaks (documented deaths) including many women, children and elderly.<ref>Bosnian Institute UK, the 26-page study: "[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2771 Prelude to the Srebrenica Genocide – mass murder and ethnic cleansing of Bosniaks in the Srebrenica region during the first three months of the Bosnian War (April–June 1992)]", 18 November 2010.</ref>

==== Struggle for Srebrenica 1992–1993 ====
Serb military and paramilitary forces from the area and neighbouring parts of eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia gained control of Srebrenica for several weeks in early 1992, killing and expelling Bosniak civilians. In May 1992, Bosnian government forces under the leadership of Orić recaptured the town.

Over the remainder of 1992, offensives by Bosnian government forces from Srebrenica increased the area under their control, and by January 1993 they had linked with Bosniak-held [[Žepa]] to the south and Cerska to the west. At this time, the Srebrenica enclave had reached its peak size of {{convert|900|km2|sqmi|abbr=off|round=50}}, although it was never linked to the main area of Bosnian-government controlled land in the west and remained, in the words of the ICTY, "a vulnerable island amid Serb-controlled territory".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/ |title=Prosecutor vs. Radislav Krstic Judgement |location= |accessdate=8 June 2006 |author=ICTY |publisher=United Nations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205104015/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/ |archivedate=5 February 2006 }}</ref> During this time, [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) forces under the command of [[Naser Orić]] used [[Srebrenica]] as a staging ground to attack neighboring Serb villages  inflicting many casualties.<ref name="OricIndict">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ori-2ai041004e.htm|title=Naser Orić: second amended indictment|publisher=The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303134851/http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ori-2ai041004e.htm|archivedate=3 March 2009}}</ref><ref name="NIOD Pt2Ch2">{{cite web|url=http://213.222.3.5/srebrenica/toc/p2_c02_s004_b01.html|title=Dutchbat in the enclave|publisher=Netherlands Institute for War Documentation (NIOD)|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721152501/http://213.222.3.5/srebrenica/toc/p2_c02_s004_b01.html|archivedate=21 July 2006}}</ref> On one occasion in 1993, the village of [[Kravica attack (1993)|Kravica]] was attacked by ARBIH and resulted in numerous Serb civilian casualties. The actions carried out by the ARBIH under the command of [[Naser Orić]] were seen as a catalyst for what occurred in Srebrenica in 1995. According to General [[Philippe Morillon]]'s testimony at the session of the ICTY 12 February 2004:{{quotation|JUDGE ROBINSON: Are you saying, then, General, that what happened in 1995 was a direct reaction to what Naser Oric did to the Serbs two years before?<br/>

Over the next few months, the Serb military captured the villages of Konjević Polje and Cerska, severing the link between Srebrenica and Žepa and reducing the size of the Srebrenica enclave to 150 square kilometres. Bosniak residents of the outlying areas converged on the town of Srebrenica and its population swelled to between 50,000 and 60,000 people.

General [[Philippe Morillon]] of France, Commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), visited Srebrenica in March 1993. By then, the town was overcrowded and [[siege]] conditions prevailed. There was almost no running water as the advancing Serb forces had destroyed the town's water supplies; people relied on makeshift generators for electricity. Food, medicine and other essentials were extremely scarce. Before leaving, General Morillon told the panicked residents of Srebrenica at a public gathering that the town was under the protection of the UN and that he would never abandon them.

During March and April 1993 several thousand Bosniaks were evacuated from Srebrenica under the auspices of the [[UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR). The evacuations were opposed by the Bosnian government in [[Sarajevo]] as contributing to the ethnic cleansing of predominantly Bosniak territory.

The Serb authorities remained intent on capturing the enclave. On 13 April 1993, the Serbs told the UNHCR representatives that they would attack the town within two days unless the Bosniaks surrendered and agreed to be evacuated.<ref>ICTY, Prosecutor vs. Krstic; Trial Chamber Judgement; United Nations; para. 13–17.</ref> The Bosniaks refused to surrender.

====Starvation in Srebrenica 1992–1995====
With the failure to demilitarize and lack of supplies getting into the city, Naser Orić consolidated his power and controlled the black market. Orić's men began hoarding food, fuel, cigarettes and embezzled money sent by foreign aid agencies to support Muslim orphans.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Danner|first1=Mark|title=Stripping Bare the Body: Politics, Violence, War|url=https://archive.org/details/strippingbarebod00dann|url-access=registration|date=1 October 2009|publisher=Nation Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/strippingbarebod00dann/page/232 232]}}</ref> Basic necessities were out of reach for many of the people in Srebrenica due to Orić's actions.

A former Serb soldier of the "[[JSO (Special Operations Unit)#History|Red Berets]]" unit described the tactics used to starve and kill the besieged population of Srebrenica:

{{quote|It was almost like a game, a cat-and-mouse hunt. But of course we greatly outnumbered the Muslims, so in almost all cases, we were the hunters and they were the prey. We needed them to surrender, but how do you get someone to surrender in a war like this? You starve them to death. So very quickly we realised that it wasn't really weapons being smuggled into Srebrenica that we should worry about, but food. They were truly starving in there, so they would send people out to steal cattle or gather crops, and our job was to find and kill them... No prisoners. Well, yes, if we thought they had useful information, we might keep them alive until we got it out of them, but in the end, no prisoners... The local people became quite indignant, so sometimes we would keep someone alive to hand over to them [to kill] just to keep them happy.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news |work=The New York Times Magazine |first=Scott |last=Anderson |date=28 May 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/05/29/magazine/srebrenica-life-in-the-valley-of-death.html |title=Life in the Valley of Death |accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>}}

The judgment of the Hague Tribunal in the case of Naser Orić found that:

{{quote|Bosnian Serb forces controlling the access roads were not allowing international humanitarian aid—most importantly, food and medicine—to reach Srebrenica. As a consequence, there was a constant and serious shortage of food causing starvation to peak in the winter of 1992/1993. Numerous people died or were in an extremely emaciated state due to malnutrition. Bosnian Muslim fighters and their families, however, were provided with food rations from existing storage facilities. The most disadvantaged group among the Bosnian Muslims was that of the refugees, who usually lived on the streets and without shelter, in freezing temperatures. Only in November and December 1992, did two UN convoys with humanitarian aid reach the enclave, and this despite Bosnian Serb obstruction."<ref>Judgment in the Oric case, par.110.

====Organisation of UNPROFOR and UNPF====
{{main|United Nations Protection Force}}
In April 1995, UNPROFOR became the name used for the Bosnia and Herzegovina regional command of the now-renamed [[United Nations Peace Forces]] (UNPF).<ref name="cnj.it" /> The 2011 report ''[[Srebrenica: a 'safe' area]]'' says that "On 12 June 1995 a new command was created under UNPF",<ref name="cnj.it">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnj.it/documentazione/Srebrenica/NIOD/NIOD%20Part%20II.pdf |title=Srebrenica – a 'safe' area |publisher=NIOD |date=2011 |accessdate=21 July 2015 |page=9}}</ref> with "12,500 British, French and Dutch troops equipped with tanks and high calibre artillery in order to increase the effectiveness and the credibility of the peacekeeping operation".<ref name="cnj.it" /> The report states:

{{quote|In the UNPROFOR [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], [[Dutchbat]] occupied the fourth tier, with the sector commanders occupying the third tier. The fourth tier primarily had an operational task. Within this structure, Dutchbat was expected to operate as an independent unit with its own logistic arrangements. Dutchbat was dependent on the UNPROFOR organization to some extent for crucial supplies such as fuel. For the rest, it was expected to obtain its supplies from the Netherlands. From an organizational point of view, the battalion had two lifelines: UNPROFOR and the Royal Netherlands Army. Dutchbat had been assigned responsibility for the Srebrenica Safe Area. Neither UNPROFOR nor Bosnia-Hercegovina paid much attention to Srebrenica, however. Srebrenica was situated in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was geographically and mentally far removed from Sarajevo and Zagreb. The rest of the world was focused on the fight for Sarajevo and the peace process. As a Safe Area, Srebrenica only occasionally managed to attract the attention of the world press or the UN Security Council. That is why the Dutch troops there remained of secondary importance, in operational and logistic terms, for so long; and why the importance of the enclave in the battle for domination between the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims failed to be recognised for so long.<ref name="cnj.it2">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnj.it/documentazione/Srebrenica/NIOD/NIOD%20Part%20II.pdf |title=Srebrenica – a 'safe' area |publisher=NIOD |date=2011 |accessdate=21 July 2015 |page=20}}</ref>}}

=== Srebrenica "safe area" ===

==== April 1993: the Security Council declares Srebrenica a "safe area" ====
[[File:Bosnia areas of control Sep 94.jpg|thumb|Areas of control in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina enclaves near the Serbian border, September 1994]]

On 16 April 1993, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 819|Resolution 819]], which demanded that "all parties and others concerned treat Srebrenica and its surroundings as a [[safe area (Bosnian War)|safe area]] which should be free from any armed attack or any other hostile act".<ref name="UN2">{{cite web|url=https://undocs.org/S/RES/819(1993)|id=S/RES/819(1993)|title=Resolution 819|publisher=United Nations|date=16 April 1993|at=para. No. 1}}</ref> On 18 April 1993, the first group of UNPROFOR troops arrived in Srebrenica. On 8 May 1993 agreement was reached for demilitarization of Srebrenica. According to UN reports, "General [Sefer] Halilović and General [Ratko] Mladić agreed on measures covering the whole of the Srebrenica enclave and the adjacent enclave of Žepa. Under the terms of the new agreement, Bosniak forces within the enclave would hand over their weapons, ammunition and mines to UNPROFOR, after which Serb "heavy weapons and units that constituted a menace to the demilitarised zones which will have been established in Žepa and Srebrenica will be withdrawn." Unlike the earlier agreement, the agreement of 8 May stated specifically that Srebrenica was to be considered a "demilitarised zone", as referred to in article 60 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I)."

Between 1,000 and 2,000 soldiers from three of the VRS Drina Corps [[Brigade]]s were deployed around the enclave, equipped with tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. The 28th Mountain Division of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) remaining in the enclave was neither well organised nor equipped: a firm command structure and communications system was lacking, and some soldiers carried old hunting rifles or no weapons at all. Few had proper uniforms.

From the outset, both parties to the conflict violated the "safe area" agreement. [[Lieutenant colonel]] [[Thom Karremans]] (the [[Dutchbat]] Commander) testified to the ICTY that his personnel were prevented from returning to the enclave by Serb forces and that equipment and ammunition were also prevented from getting in.<ref name="ICTY">ICTY, ''[http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/acjug/en/krs-aj040419e.pdf Prosecutor vs. Kristic, Judgement]''.</ref> Bosniaks in Srebrenica complained of attacks by Serb soldiers, while to the Serbs it appeared that Bosnian government forces in Srebrenica were using the "safe area" as a convenient base from which to launch counter-offensives against the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) and that UNPROFOR was failing to take any action to prevent it.<ref name="ICTY" /> General [[Sefer Halilović]] admitted that ARBiH helicopters had flown in violation of the no-fly zone and that he had personally dispatched eight helicopters with ammunition for the 28th Division.

==== United Nations failure to demilitarise Srebrenica ====
A Security Council mission led by [[Diego Arria]] arrived in Srebrenica on 25 April 1993 and, in their subsequent report to the UN, condemned the Serbs for perpetrating "a slow-motion process of genocide."<ref name="UN report">{{cite web|title=Report of the Secretary-General pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53/35 — The fall of Srebrenica|url=https://undocs.org/A/54/549|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=15 March 2017|language=en}}</ref> The mission then stated that "Serb forces must withdraw to points from which they cannot attack, harass or terrorise the town. UNPROFOR should be in a position to determine the related parameters. The mission believes, as does UNPROFOR, that the actual 4.5&nbsp;km by 0.5&nbsp;km decided as a safe area should be greatly expanded." Specific instructions from United Nations Headquarters in New York stated that UNPROFOR should not be too zealous in searching for Bosniak weapons and, later, that the Serbs should withdraw their heavy weapons before the Bosniaks gave up their weapons. The Serbs never did withdraw their heavy weapons.<ref name="UN report" />

Multiple attempts to demilitarise the ARBiH and force the withdrawal of the VRS proved futile. The ARBiH hid the majority of their heavy weapons, modern equipment and ammunition in the surrounding forest and only handed over disused and old weaponry.<ref name="auto1"/> On the other hand, given the failure to disarm the ARBiH, the VRS refused to withdraw from the front lines given the intelligence they had regarding hidden weaponry.<ref name="auto1"/>

==== Early 1995: the situation in the Srebrenica "safe area" deteriorates ====
By early 1995, fewer and fewer supply convoys were making it through to the enclave. The situation in Srebrenica and in other enclaves had deteriorated into lawless violence as prostitution among young Muslim girls, theft and black marketeering proliferated.<ref>[[#Ramet|Ramet (2006)]], p. 443</ref> The already meager resources of the civilian population dwindled further, and even the UN forces started running dangerously low on food, medicine, ammunition and fuel, eventually being forced to start patrolling the enclave on foot. Dutch soldiers who left the area on leave were not allowed to return,<ref name="UN report" /> and their number dropped from 600 to 400 men.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} In March and April, the Dutch soldiers noticed a build-up of Serb forces near two of the observation posts, "OP Romeo" and "OP Quebec".

In March 1995, [[Radovan Karadžić]], President of the Republika Srpska (RS), despite pressure from the international community to end the war and ongoing efforts to negotiate a peace agreement, issued a directive to the VRS concerning the long-term strategy of the VRS forces in the enclave. The directive, known as "Directive 7", specified that the VRS was to:

{{quote|complete the physical separation of Srebrenica from Žepa as soon as possible, preventing even communication between individuals in the two enclaves.

By mid-1995, the humanitarian situation of the Bosniak civilians and military personnel in the enclave was catastrophic. In May, following orders, Orić and his staff left the enclave by helicopter to [[Tuzla]], leaving senior officers in command of the 28th Division. In late June and early July, the 28th Division issued a series of reports including urgent pleas for the [[humanitarian corridor]] to the enclave to be reopened. When this failed, Bosniak civilians began dying from starvation. On Friday, 7 July the mayor of Srebrenica reported that eight residents had died of starvation.<ref>BALKAN WATCH The Balkan Institute 10 July 1995 A Weekly Review of Current Events Volume 2.26 Week in Review 3–9 July 1995 [http://www.hri.org/cgi-bin/brief?/news/misc/misc-news/1995/95-07-11_1.misc.txt]</ref>

On 4 June 1995, UNPROFOR commander [[Bernard Janvier]], a Frenchman, secretly met with Ratko Mladić to obtain the release of hostages, many of whom were French. Mladić demanded of Janvier that there would be no more air strikes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Remarks by the High Commissioner to the Security Council meeting on Bosnia and Herzegovina (Srebrenica) |url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16218&LangID=E |website=ohchr}}</ref>

In the weeks leading up to the assault on Srebrenica by the [[Army of Republika Srpska|VRS]], ARBiH forces were ordered to carry out diversion and disruption attacks on the VRS by the high command.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} On one particular occasion on the evening of 25–26 June, ARBiH forces attacked VRS units on the [[Sarajevo]]-[[Zvornik]], road inflicting high casualties and looting VRS stockpiles.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} These continued attacks prompted a response from Mladić, who contacted the UN headquarters in Sarajevo and advised that he would no longer tolerate ARBiH incursions into the Bosnian Serb countryside.

==== 6–11 July 1995: Serb take-over of Srebrenica ====
{{main|Operation Krivaja '95}}

The Serb offensive against Srebrenica began in earnest on 6 July 1995. The [[Army of Republika Srpska|VRS]], with 2,000 soldiers, were outnumbered by the defenders and did not expect the assault to be an easy conquest.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} In the following days, the five UNPROFOR observation posts in the southern part of the enclave fell one by one in the face of the Bosnian Serb advance. Some of the Dutch soldiers retreated into the enclave after their posts were attacked, but the crews of the other observation posts surrendered into Serb custody. Simultaneously, the defending Bosnian forces numbering 6,000 came under heavy fire and were pushed back towards the town. Once the southern perimeter began to collapse, about 4,000 Bosniak residents who had been living in a Swedish housing complex for refugees nearby fled north into the town of Srebrenica. Dutch soldiers reported that the advancing Serbs were "cleansing" the houses in the southern part of the enclave.<ref name="Krstic 2001 takeover">{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=16 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

VRS tanks were approaching the town, and NATO airstrikes on these began on the afternoon of 11 July 1995. NATO bombers attempted to attack VRS artillery locations outside the town, but poor visibility forced NATO to cancel this operation.

By the evening of 11 July 1995, approximately 20,000 to 25,000 Bosniak refugees from Srebrenica were gathered in Potočari, seeking protection within the [[UNPROFOR]] Dutchbat headquarters. Several thousand had pressed inside the compound itself, while the rest were spread throughout the neighbouring factories and fields. Although the vast majority were women, children, elderly or disabled, 63 witnesses estimated that there were at least 300 men inside the perimeter of the UNPROFOR compound and between 600 and 900 men in the crowd outside.<ref name="ICTY" /> UNPROFOR Dutchbat soldiers [on site] claimed{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} their base was full.

Conditions in Potočari included "little food or water available" and sweltering heat. One UNPROFOR Dutchbat officer described the scene as follows:

{{quote|They were panicked, they were scared, and they were pressing each other against the soldiers, my soldiers, the UN soldiers that tried to calm them. People that fell were trampled on. It was a chaotic situation.<ref name="ICTY" />}}

On 12 July, the United Nations Security Council, in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1004|Resolution 1004]], expressed concern at the humanitarian situation in Potočari, which also condemned the offensive by Bosnian Serb forces and demanded immediate withdrawal.

On 13 July, the Dutch forces expelled five Bosniak refugees from the United Nations compound despite knowing that men outside the compound were being killed and abused.<ref name="NYT9613">{{cite news|title=Dutch Peacekeepers Are Found Responsible for Deaths|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/world/europe/dutch-peacekeepers-are-found-responsible-for-deaths.html|accessdate=7 September 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 September 2013|author=Marlise Simons|quote=Dutchbat soldiers knew that outside the compound men were being killed and abused, the court summary said, but the soldiers decided not to evacuate most refugees, including the three men, along with the battalion and instead sent them away on 13 July.}}</ref>

=== Crimes committed in Potočari ===

On 12 July 1995, as the day wore on, the refugees in the compound could see VRS members setting houses and haystacks on fire. Throughout the afternoon, Serb soldiers mingled in the crowd and [[summary executions]] of men occurred.<ref name="ICTY" /> In the late morning of 12 July a witness saw a pile of 20 to 30 bodies heaped up behind the Transport Building in Potočari, alongside a tractor-like machine. Another testified that he saw a soldier slay a child with a knife in the middle of a crowd of expellees. He also said that he saw Serb soldiers execute more than a hundred Bosniak Muslim men in the area behind the Zinc Factory and then load their bodies onto a truck, although the number and nature of the murders stand in contrast to other evidence in the Trial Record, which indicates that the killings in Potočari were sporadic in nature. Soldiers were picking people out of the crowd and taking them away. A witness recounted how three brothers—one merely a child and the others in their teens—were taken out in the night. When the boys' mother went looking for them, she found them stark naked and with their throats slit.<ref name="ICTY" /><ref name="Krstic 2001 Potočari">{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=18 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

=== Separation and murder of Bosniak men and boys in Potočari ===
From the morning of 12 July, Serb forces began gathering men and boys from the refugee population in Potočari and holding them in separate locations, and as the refugees began boarding the buses headed north towards Bosniak-held territory, Serb soldiers separated out men of military age who were trying to clamber aboard. Occasionally, younger and older men were stopped as well (some as young as 14 or 15).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/trans/en/000726ed.htm |title=Separation of boys, Krstic ICTY Potocari |publisher=Icty.org |date=26 July 2000 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/popovic/trans/en/070206ED.htm |title=Separation, Popovic ICTY |publisher=Icty.org |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/trans/en/000411ed.htm |title=Separation, Krstic ICTY |publisher=Icty.org |date=11 July 1995 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref>
These men were taken to a building in Potočari referred to as the "White House". As early as the evening of 12 July 1995, Major Franken of the Dutchbat heard that no men were arriving with the women and children at their destination in [[Kladanj]].<ref name="ICTY" /> At this time, the UNHCR Director of Operations, Peter Walsh, was dispatched to Srebrenica by the UNHCR Chief of Mission, Damaso Feci, to evaluate what emergency aid could be provided rapidly. Peter Walsh and his team arrived at Gostilj, just outside Srebrenica, in the early afternoon only to be turned away by VRS forces. Despite claiming freedom of movement rights, the UNHCR team was not allowed to proceed and was forced to head back north to Bijelina. Throughout this time, Peter Walsh relayed reports back to UNHCR in Zagreb about the unfolding situation including witnessing the enforced movement and abuse of Muslim men and boys and the sound of summary executions taking place.

On 13 July 1995, Dutchbat troops witnessed definite signs that the Serb soldiers were murdering some of the Bosniak men who had been separated. For example, Corporal Vaasen saw two soldiers take a man behind the "White House", heard a shot and saw the two soldiers reappear alone. Another Dutchbat officer saw Serb soldiers murder an unarmed man with a single gunshot to the head and heard gunshots 20–40 times an hour throughout the afternoon. When the Dutchbat soldiers told Colonel Joseph Kingori, a [[United Nations Military Observer]] (UNMO) in the Srebrenica area, that men were being taken behind the "White House" and not coming back, Colonel Kingori went to investigate. He heard gunshots as he approached, but was stopped by Serb soldiers before he could find out what was going on.<ref name="ICTY" />

Some of the executions were carried out at night under arc lights, and bulldozers then pushed the bodies into mass graves.<ref name="CNN-2006-05-03">Graham Jones. [http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/02/22/warcrimes.srebrenica/ Srebrenica: A Triumph of Evil], CNN 3 May 2006</ref> According to evidence collected from Bosniaks by French policeman Jean-René Ruez, some were buried alive; he also heard testimony describing Serb forces killing and torturing refugees at will, streets littered with corpses, people committing suicide to avoid having their noses, lips and ears chopped off, and adults being forced to watch the soldiers kill their children.<ref name="CNN-2006-05-03" />

==== Rape and abuse of civilians ====
Thousands of women and girls suffered rape and sexual abuse and other forms of torture. According to the testimony of Zumra Šehomerovic:

{{quote|The Serbs began at a certain point to take girls and young women out of the group of refugees. They were raped. The rapes often took place under the eyes of others and sometimes even under the eyes of the children of the mother. A Dutch soldier stood by and he simply looked around with a [[Walkman]] on his head. He did not react at all to what was happening. It did not happen just before my eyes, for I saw that personally, but also before the eyes of us all. The Dutch soldiers walked around everywhere. It is impossible that they did not see it.

There was a woman with a small baby a few months old. A [[Chetnik]] told the mother that the child must stop crying. When the child did not stop crying, he snatched the child away and cut its throat. Then he laughed. There was a Dutch soldier there who was watching. He did not react at all.

I saw yet more frightful things. For example, there was a girl, she must have been about nine years old. At a certain moment some Chetniks recommended to her brother that he rape the girl. He did not do it and I also think that he could not have done it for he was still just a child. Then they murdered that young boy. I have personally seen all that. I really want to emphasize that all this happened in the immediate vicinity of the base. In the same way I also saw other people who were murdered. Some of them had their throats cut. Others were [[behead]]ed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-tools.org/en/doc/ca1e99/|website=legal-tools.org|author=Van Diepen Van der Kroef Advocaten|title=Writ of Summons: District Court, The Hague|date=4 June 2007|pages=107–108}}</ref>}}

Testimony of Ramiza Gurdić:

{{quote|I saw how a young boy of about ten was killed by Serbs in Dutch uniform. This happened in front of my own eyes. The mother sat on the ground and her young son sat beside her. The young boy was placed on his mother's lap. The young boy was killed. His head was cut off. The body remained on the lap of the mother. The Serbian soldier placed the head of the young boy on his knife and showed it to everyone. … I saw how a pregnant woman was slaughtered. There were Serbs who stabbed her in the stomach, cut her open and took two small children out of her stomach and then beat them to death on the ground. I saw this with my own eyes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-tools.org/en/doc/ca1e99/|website=legal-tools.org|author=Van Diepen Van der Kroef Advocaten|title=Writ of Summons: District Court, The Hague|date=4 June 2007|page=101}}</ref>}}

Testimony of Kada Hotić:

{{quote|There was a young woman with a baby on the way to the bus. The baby cried and a Serbian soldier told her that she had to make sure that the baby was quiet. Then the soldier took the child from the mother and cut its throat. I do not know whether Dutchbat soldiers saw that. … There was a sort of fence on the left-hand side of the road to Potocari. I heard then a young woman screaming very close by (4 or 5 meters away). I then heard another woman beg: "Leave her, she is only nine years old." The screaming suddenly stopped. I was so in shock that I could scarcely move. … The rumour later quickly circulated that a nine year old girl had been raped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-tools.org/en/doc/ca1e99/|website=legal-tools.org|author=Van Diepen Van der Kroef Advocaten|title=Writ of Summons: District Court, The Hague|date=4 June 2007|page=104}}</ref>}}

That night, a DutchBat medical orderly came across two Serb soldiers raping a young woman:

{{quote|[W]e saw two Serb soldiers, one of them was standing guard and the other one was lying on the girl, with his pants off. And we saw a girl lying on the ground, on some kind of mattress. There was blood on the mattress, even she was covered with blood. She had bruises on her legs. There was even blood coming down her legs. She was in total shock. She went totally crazy.

Bosnian Muslim refugees nearby could see the rape, but could do nothing about it because of Serb soldiers standing nearby. Other people heard women screaming, or saw women being dragged away. Several individuals were so terrified that they committed suicide by hanging themselves. Throughout the night and early the next morning, stories about the rapes and killings spread through the crowd and the terror in the camp escalated.

Screams, gunshots and other frightening noises were audible throughout the night and no one could sleep. Soldiers were picking people out of the crowd and taking them away: some returned; others did not. Witness T recounted how three brothers—one merely a child and the others in their teens—were taken out in the night. When the boys' mother went looking for them, she found them with their throats slit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org |title=Radislav Krstic Trial Chambers Judgement |publisher=Icty.org |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref>}}

==== Deportation of women ====
As a result of exhaustive UN negotiations with Serb troops, around 25,000 Srebrenica women were forcibly transferred to Bosniak-controlled territory.

Some buses apparently never reached safety. According to a witness account given by Kadir Habibović, who hid himself on one of the first buses from the base in Potočari to Kladanj, he saw at least one vehicle full of Bosniak women being driven away from Bosnian government-held territory.<ref name="Rhode">{{citation|last1=Rohde |first1=David|title=Account of Women Taken|publisher=Columbia University|date=2 October 1995|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/journalism/nelson/rohde/p-1025.html|access-date=7 January 2018}}</ref>

=== Column of Bosniak men ===

On the evening of 11 July 1995, word spread through the Bosniak community that able-bodied men should take to the woods, form a [[column (formation)|column]] together with members of the ARBiH's 28th Division and attempt a breakthrough towards Bosnian government-held territory in the north.<ref name="ICTY: Radislav Krstić verdict – The Column of Bosnian Muslim Men">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIA7b |title=ICTY: Radislav Krstić verdict – The Column of Bosnian Muslim Men |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105091809/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm |archivedate=5 January 2008 }}</ref> The men believed they stood a better chance of surviving by trying to escape than if they let themselves fall into Serb hands.<ref>Witness P-104 evidence to the Blagojevic trial, ICTY Case IT-06-60-T, Trial Chamber Judgment, 17 January 2005, Footnote 460, p. 52 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/blagojevic_jokic/tjug/en/bla-050117e.pdf].

Around 10&nbsp;pm on 11 July the Division command, together with the municipal authorities, took the decision, on their own initiative, to form a column and leave the safe area in an attempt to reach government-controlled territory around Tuzla.<ref name="icty.org">Enver Hadzihasanovic evidence to the Krstic trial, 6 April 2001, ICTY transcript p 9528 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/trans/en/010406ed.htm].

Dehydration made finding drinking water a major problem, along with lack of sleep and physical exhaustion—many were exhausted before setting out.

The attacks on the column broke it up into smaller segments. Only about one third of the men succeeded in crossing the asphalt road between [[Konjević Polje]] and [[Nova Kasaba]]. It was this group that eventually crossed Bosnian Serb lines to reach Bosnian government territory on and after 16 July. The vast majority of the victims of the massacre were members of the column who failed to complete the perilous journey.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

==== Other groups ====
A second, smaller group of refugees (estimated at between 700 and 800) attempted to escape into Serbia via Mount Kvarac via Bratunac, or across the river [[Drina]] and via [[Bajina Bašta]]. It is not known how many were intercepted, arrested and killed on the way. A third group headed for Žepa, possibly having first tried to reach Tuzla. The estimates of the numbers involved vary widely, from 300 to around 850. In addition, small pockets of resistance apparently remained behind and engaged Serb forces.

Almost all the 28th Division, 5,500 to 6,000 soldiers, not all armed, gathered in the village of Šušnjari, in the hills north of the town of Srebrenica, along with about 7,000 civilians.

At around midnight on 11 July 1995, the column started moving along the axis between Konjević Polje and Bratunac.

The column was led by a group of 50–100 of the best soldiers from each brigade, carrying the best available equipment. Elements of the 284th Brigade were followed by the 280th Brigade, with them the Chief of Staff Ramiz Bećirović.

On the afternoon of 12 July, the front section emerged from the woods and crossed the asphalt road from Konjević Polje and Nova Kasaba. Around 18.00 hours, the VRS Army located the main part of the column still in the hilly area around Kamenica (outside the village of [[Pobuđe]]). Around 20:00 hours this part of the column, led by the municipal authorities and the wounded, started descending Kamenica Hill ({{Coord|44|19|53|N|18|14|5|E|type:mountain|name=Karmenica}}) towards the road. After a few dozen men had crossed, soldiers of the VRS Army arrived from the direction of [[Kravica]] in trucks and armoured vehicles including a white vehicle with UNPROFOR symbols, calling out for Bosniaks over the loudspeaker to surrender.<ref name="trial-ch.org" />

Heavy shooting and shelling began, which continued into the night. The armed members of the column returned fire and all scattered. Survivors describe a group of at least 1,000 engaged at close range by small arms. Hundreds appear to have been killed as they fled the open area and some were said to have killed themselves to escape capture.

VRS Army and Ministry of Interior personnel persuaded members of the column to surrender by promising them protection and safe transportation towards Tuzla under UNPROFOR and Red Cross supervision. Appropriated UN and Red Cross equipment was used to deceive the refugees into believing the promises. Surrendering prisoners' personal belongings were confiscated and some were executed on the spot.<ref name="trial-ch.org" />

The rear of the column lost contact with the front and panic broke out. Many people remained in the Kamenica Hill area for a number of days, unable to move on with the escape route blocked by Serb forces. Thousands of Bosniaks surrendered or were captured. Some prisoners were ordered to summon friends and family members from the woods. There were reports of Serb forces using megaphones to call on the marchers to surrender, telling them that they would be exchanged for Serb soldiers held captive by Bosniak forces. It was at Kamenica that VRS personnel in civilian dress were reported to have infiltrated the column. Men from the rear of the column who survived this ordeal described it as a manhunt.<ref name="ICTY: Radislav Krstić verdict – The Column of Bosnian Muslim Men" />

==== Sandići massacre ====
[[File:Exhumations in Srebrenica 1996.jpg|thumb|[[Exhumation]]s in Srebrenica, 1996]]

Close to Sandići, on the main road from Bratunac to Konjević Polje, one witness describes the Serbs forcing a Bosniak man to call other Bosniaks down from the mountains. Some 200 to 300 men, including the witness' brother, followed his instructions and descended to meet the VRS, presumably expecting some exchange of prisoners would take place. The witness hid behind a tree to see what would happen next. He watched as the men were lined up in seven ranks, each some forty metres in length, with their hands behind their heads; they were then mowed down by machine gun fire.<ref name="autogenerated3665">Witness PW-139 evidence to the Popovic et al trial, 6 November 2006, ICTY transcript pp3665-3666 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/popovic/trans/en/061106ED.htm].

A small number of women, children and elderly people who had been part of the column were allowed to join the buses evacuating the women and children out of Potočari. Among them was Alma Delimustafić, a soldier of the 28th Brigade; at this time, Delimustafić was in her civilian clothes and was released.<ref>ABiH Tuzla.

This report was signed by Sarajlic Osman.</ref>

==== Trek to Mount Udrč ====
The central section of the column managed to escape the shooting and reached Kamenica at about 11.00 hours and waited there for the wounded. [[Captain (land)|Captain]] Ejub Golić and the Independent Battalion turned back towards Hajdučko Groblje to help the casualties. A number of survivors from the rear, who managed to escape crossed the asphalt roads to the north or the west of the area, had joined those in the central section of the column. The front third of the column, which had already left Kamenica Hill by the time the ambush occurred, headed for Mount Udrč ({{Coord|44|16|59|N|19|3|6|E|type:mountain|name=Mount Udrc}}); crossing the main asphalt road, they then forded the river Jadar. They reached the base of the mountain early on the morning of Thursday, 13 July and regrouped. At first, it was decided to send 300 ARBiH soldiers back in an attempt to break through the blockades. When reports came in that the central section of the column had nevertheless succeeded in crossing the road at Konjević Polje, this plan was abandoned. Approximately 1,000 additional men managed to reach Udrč that night.<ref>ABiH Tuzla. ABiH 2nd Corps (unnumbered). Additional statement by Ramiz Bećirović, 16/04/98, based on an earlier statement of 11/08/95.</ref>

==== Snagovo ambush ====
From Udrč the marchers moved toward the River Drinjača and on to Mount Velja Glava, continuing through the night. Finding a Serb presence at Mount Velja Glava, where they arrived on Friday, 14 July, the column was forced to skirt the mountain and wait on its slopes before it was able to move on toward [[Liplje, Zvornik|Liplje]] and Marčići. Arriving at Marčići in the evening of 14 July, the marchers were again ambushed near Snagovo by Serb forces equipped with anti-aircraft guns, artillery, and tanks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=17|page=17|title=The Events in and Around Srebrenica Between 10th and 19th July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223001/http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=17|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=11 June 2004}}</ref>

According to Lieutenant Džemail Bećirović, the column managed to break through the ambush and, in so doing, captured a VRS officer, Major Zoran Janković—providing the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a significant bargaining counter. This prompted an attempt at negotiating a cessation in the fighting, but negotiations with local Serb forces failed.<ref>Zoran Janković evidence to the Popović et al trial, 27 October 2008, ICTY transcript p 27369 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/popovic/trans/en/081027ED.htm]. Retrieved 13 April 2010.</ref> Nevertheless, the act of repulsing the ambush had a positive effect on morale of the marchers, who also captured a number of weapons and supplies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==== Approaching the frontline ====
The evening of 15 July saw the first radio contact between the 2nd Corps and the 28th Division, established using a [[walkie-talkie]] captured from the VRS. After initial distrust on the part of the 28th Division, the Šabić brothers were able to identify each other as they stood on either side of the VRS lines. Early in the morning, the column crossed the asphalt road linking Zvornik with Caparde and headed in the direction of Planinci, leaving a unit of some 100 to 200 armed marchers behind to wait for stragglers. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The column reached Križevići later that day, and remained there while an attempt was made to negotiate with local Serb forces for safe passage through the Serb lines into Bosnian government controlled territory. The members of the column were advised to stay where they were, and to allow the Serb forces time to arrange for safe passage. It soon became apparent, though, that the small Serb force deployed in the area was only trying to gain time to organise a further attack on the marchers. In the area of Marčići - Crni Vrh, the VRS armed forces deployed 500 soldiers and policemen in order to stop the split part of the column (about 2,500 people), which was moving from Glodi towards Marčići. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

At this point, the column's leaders decided to form several small groups of between 100 and 200 persons and send these to reconnoiter the way ahead. Early in the afternoon, the 2nd Corps and the 28th Division of the ARBiH met each other in the village of Potočani. The presidium of Srebrenica were the first to reach Bosnian terrain. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==== Breakthrough at Baljkovica ====
The hillside at Baljkovica ({{Coord|44|27|N|18|58|E|name=Baljkovica|type:city}}) formed the last VRS line separating the column from Bosnian-held territory. The VRS cordon actually consisted of two lines, the first of which presented a front on the Tuzla side against the 2nd Corps and the other a front against the approaching 28th Division.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

On the evening of 15 July a heavy hailstorm caused the Serb forces to take cover. The column's advance group took advantage of this to attack the Serb rear lines at Baljkovica. During the fighting, the main body of what remained of the column began to move from Krizevici. It reached the area of fighting at about 3&nbsp;am on Sunday, 16 July.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

At approximately 05.00 hours on 16 July, the 2nd Corps made its first attempt to break through the VRS cordon from the Bosnian side. The objective was to force a breakthrough close to the hamlets of Parlog and Resnik. They were joined by Naser Orić and a number of his men. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Around 8&nbsp;am on the morning of 16 July parts of the 28th Division, with the 2nd Corps of the RBiH Army from Tuzla providing artillery support, attacked and breached VRS Army lines. There was fierce fighting across the general area of Baljkovica.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=21|page=21|title=The Events in and Around Srebrenica Between 10th and 19th July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223001/http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=21|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=11 June 2004}}</ref>

Captured heavy arms including two Praga [[self-propelled anti-aircraft]] guns were fired at the Serb front line and the column finally succeeded in breaking through to Bosnian government controlled territory and linking up with BiH units at between 1&nbsp;pm and 2&nbsp;pm on 16 July. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==== Baljkovica corridor ====
Following radio negotiations between the 2nd Corps and the Zvornik Brigade, the Zvornik Brigade Command, which had lost three lines of trenches, agreed to open a corridor to allow "evacuation" of the column in return for the release of captured policemen and soldiers. The Baljkovica corridor was open from 14.00 to 17.00 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=21|pages=21–22|title=The Events in and Around Srebrenica Between 10th and 19th July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223001/http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=21|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=11 June 2004}}</ref>

After the corridor was closed between 17.00 and 18.00 hours the Zvornik Brigade Command reported that around 5000 civilians, with probably "a certain number of soldiers" with them had been let through, but "all those who passed were unarmed".<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf|page=22|title=The Events in and Around Srebrenica Between 10th and 19th July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223001/http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=11 June 2004}}</ref>

==== Arrival at Tuzla ====
[[File:Srebrenica 2008 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Damaged building in Srebrenica after the war]]

By 4 August or thereabouts, the ArBiH determined that 3,175 members of the 28th Division had managed to get through to Tuzla. 2,628 members of the Division, soldiers and officers, were considered certain to have been killed. The approximate number of individual members of the column killed was estimated at between 8,300 and 9,722.<ref>Enver Hadzihasanovic evidence to the Krstic trial, 6 April 2001, ICTY transcript p 9532 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/trans/en/010406ed.htm]. Retrieved 7 April 2010.</ref>

==== After the closure of the corridor ====
Once the corridor had closed Serb forces recommenced hunting down parts of the column still in areas under their control. Around 2,000 refugees were reported to be hiding in the woods in the area of Pobudje.<ref name="ReferenceB" />

On 17 July 1995, "searching the terrain", the VRS Army captured a number of Bosniaks. Four children aged between 8 and 14 captured by the Bratunac Brigade were taken to the military barracks in Bratunac.<ref name="ReferenceB" /><ref name="B&J para.467">{{cite web|work=ICTY|title=Prosecutor v.

On 18 July, after a soldier was killed "trying to capture some persons during the search operation", the Zvornik Brigade Command issued an order to execute prisoners in its zone of
responsibility in order to avoid any risks associated with their capture. The order was presumed to have remained effective until it was countermanded on 21 July.<ref name="ReferenceB" />

====Mass hysteria====
According to a 1998 [[Qualitative research|qualitative study]] involving survivors of the column, many of the members of the column exhibited symptoms of hallucinations to varying degrees.<ref name="auto2">{{cite journal|last=Hay|first=Alastair|title=Surviving the Impossible: The Long March from Srebrenica. An Investigation of the Possible Use of Chemical Warfare Agents|journal=Medicine, Conflict and Survival|volume=14|issue=2|pages=120–155|doi=10.1080/13623699808409383|date=1998|pmid=9633268}}</ref> On a number of occasions, Bosniak men began attacking one another in an apparent fear that the other member in the column was a Serb soldier. Members of the column also reported seeing people speaking incoherently, running towards VRS lines in a fit of rage and committing suicide using firearms and hand grenades. Although there was no evidence to suggest what exactly caused the behaviour, the study suggested that fatigue and stress may have induced these symptoms.<ref name="auto2"/>

=== Plan to execute the men of Srebrenica ===

Although Serb forces had long been blamed for the massacre, it was not until June 2004—following the Srebrenica commission's preliminary report—that Serb officials acknowledged that their security forces planned and carried out the mass killing. A Serb commission's final report on the 1995 Srebrenica massacre acknowledged that the [[mass murder]] of the men and boys was planned. The commission found that more than 7,800 were killed after it compiled thirty-four{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} lists of victims.

A concerted effort was made to capture all Bosniak men of military age.<ref name=unKrsticV>{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=32 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

These men and boys were targeted regardless of whether they chose to flee to Potočari or to join the Bosnian Muslim column. The operation to capture and detain the Bosnian Muslim men was well organised and comprehensive. The buses which transported the women and children were systematically searched for men.<ref name=unKrsticV/>

=== Mass executions ===

The vast amount of planning and high-level coordination invested in killing thousands of men in a few days is apparent from the scale and the methodical nature in which the executions were carried out. A concerted effort was made to capture all Bosniak men of military age. In fact, those
captured included many boys well below that age and elderly men above it.<ref name=unKrsticV/>

The [[Army of Republika Srpska]] took the largest number of prisoners on 13 July, along the Bratunac-Konjević Polje road. It remains impossible to cite a precise figure, but witness statements describe the assembly points such as the field at Sandići, the agricultural [[warehouses]] in Kravica, the school in Konjević Polje, the [[Association football pitch|football field]] in Nova Kasaba, the village of Lolići and the village school of Luke. Several thousands of people were herded together in the field near Sandići and on the Nova Kasaba football pitch, where they were searched and put into smaller groups. In a video tape made by journalist Zoran Petrović, a Serb soldier states that at least 3,000 to 4,000 men had given themselves up on the road. By the late afternoon of 13 July, the total had risen to some 6,000 according to the intercepted radio communication; the following day, Major Franken of Dutchbat was given the same figure by Colonel Radislav Janković of the Serb army. Many of the prisoners had been seen in the locations described by passing convoys taking the women and children to Kladanj by bus, while various aerial photographs have since provided evidence to confirm this version of events.<ref name="Neth-WarDocs"/><ref name=unKrsticV/>

One hour after the evacuation of the females from Potočari was completed, the Drina Corps staff diverted the buses to the areas in which the men were being held. Colonel Krsmanović, who on 12 July had arranged the buses for the evacuation, ordered the 700 men in Sandići to be collected, and the soldiers guarding them made them throw their possessions on a large heap and hand over anything of value. During the afternoon, the group in Sandići was visited by Mladić who told them that they would come to no harm, that they would be treated as prisoners of war, that they would be exchanged for other prisoners and that their families had been escorted to Tuzla in safety. Some of these men were placed on the transport to Bratunac and other locations, while some were marched on foot to the warehouses in Kravica. The men gathered on the soccer ground at Nova Kasaba were forced to hand over their personal belongings. They too received a personal visit from Mladić during the afternoon of 13 July; on this occasion, he announced that the Bosnian authorities in Tuzla did not want the men and that they were therefore to be taken to other locations. The men in Nova Kasaba were loaded onto buses and trucks and were taken to Bratunac or the other locations.<ref name=unKrsticV/>

The Bosnian men who had been separated from the women, children and elderly in Potočari numbering approximately 1,000 were transported to Bratunac and subsequently joined by Bosnian men captured from the column.<ref>Jean-René Ruez evidence to the Blagojevic trial, 19 May 2003 ICTY transcript p 480 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/blagojevic_jokic/trans/en/030519IT.htm]. Retrieved 7 April 2010.</ref> Almost without exception, the thousands of Bosnian prisoners captured, following the take-over of Srebrenica, were executed. Some were killed individually or in small groups by the soldiers who captured them and some were killed in the places where they were temporarily detained. Most, however, were killed in carefully orchestrated mass executions, commencing on 13 July 1995 in the region just north of Srebrenica.

The mass executions followed a well-established pattern. The men were first taken to empty schools or warehouses. After being detained there for some hours, they were loaded onto buses or trucks and taken to another site for execution. Usually, the execution fields were in isolated locations. The prisoners were unarmed and in many cases, steps had been taken to minimise resistance, such as [[blindfold]]ing them, binding their wrists behind their backs with ligatures or removing their shoes. Once at the killing fields, the men were taken off the trucks in small groups, lined up and shot. Those who survived the initial round of shooting were individually shot with an extra round, though sometimes only after they had been left to suffer for a time.<ref name=unKrsticV/>

The process of finding victim bodies in the Srebrenica region, often in mass graves, [[exhumation|exhuming]] them and finally identifying them was relatively slow.

==== Morning of 13 July: Jadar River ====
A small-scale execution took place prior to midday at the Jadar River on 13 July. Seventeen men were transported by bus a short distance to a spot on the banks of the Jadar River. The men were then lined up and shot. One man, after being hit in the hip by a bullet, jumped into the river and managed to escape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=74 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

The first large-scale mass executions began on the afternoon of 13 July 1995 in the valley of the River Cerska, to the west of Konjević Polje. One witness, hidden among trees, saw two or three trucks, followed by an armoured vehicle and an earthmoving machine proceeding towards Cerska. After that, he heard gunshots for half an hour and then saw the armoured vehicle going in the opposite direction, but not the earthmoving machine. Other witnesses report seeing a pool of blood alongside the road to Cerska that day. Muhamed Duraković, a UN translator, probably passed this execution site later that day. He reports seeing bodies tossed into a ditch alongside the road, with some men still alive.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Cerska Valley">{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=76 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

Aerial photos and excavations later confirmed the presence of a mass grave near this location. Ammunition cartridges found at the scene reveal that the victims were lined up on one side of the road, whereupon their executioners shot from the other. The bodies—150 in number—were covered with earth where they lay. It could later be established that they had been killed by guns. All were men, between the ages of 14 and 50. All but three of the 150 were wearing civilian clothes. Many had their hands tied behind their backs. Nine could later be identified and were indeed on the list of missing persons from Srebrenica.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Cerska Valley"/>

==== Late afternoon of 13 July: Kravica ====
Later on the afternoon of 13 July executions were also conducted in the largest of four warehouses (farm sheds) owned by the Agricultural Cooperative in Kravica. Between 1,000 and 1,500 men had been captured in fields near Sandići and detained in Sandići Meadow. They were brought to Kravica, either by bus or on foot, the distance being approximately one kilometer. A witness recalls seeing around 200 men, stripped to the waist and with their hands in the air, being forced to run in the direction of Kravica. An aerial photograph taken at 14:00 hours that afternoon shows two buses standing in front of the sheds.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Kravica Warehouse">{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=77 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

Involvement of the Drina Corps in the Mass Executions – (c) Late Afternoon of 13 July 1995: Kravica Warehouse |date=2 August 2001 |publisher=ICTY }}</ref>

At around 18:00 hours, when the men were all held in the warehouse, VRS soldiers threw in [[hand grenades]] and fired with various weapons, including [[rocket propelled grenade]]s. The mass murder in Kravica seemed "well organised and involved a substantial amount of planning, requiring the participation of the Drina Corps Command."<ref name="Krstic 2001 Kravica Warehouse"/>

Supposedly, there was more killing in and around Kravica and Sandići. Even before the murders in the warehouse, some 200 or 300 men were formed up in ranks near Sandići and then were executed en masse with concentrated machine guns. At Kravica, it seems that the local population had a hand in the killings. Some victims were mutilated and killed with knives. The bodies were taken to Bratunac or simply dumped in the river that runs alongside the road. One witness stated that this all took place on 14 July. There were three survivors of the mass murder in the farm sheds at Kravica.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Kravica Warehouse"/>

Armed guards shot at the men who tried to climb out the windows to escape the massacre. When the shooting stopped, the shed was full of bodies. Another survivor, who was only slightly wounded, reports:

{{quote|I was not even able to touch the floor, the concrete floor of the warehouse.... After the shooting, I felt a strange kind of heat, warmth, which was coming from the blood that covered the concrete floor and I was stepping on the dead people who were lying around. But there were even men (just men) who were still alive, who were only wounded and as soon as I would step on him, I would hear him cry, moan, because I was trying to move as fast as I could. I could tell that people had been completely disembodied and I could feel bones of the people that had been hit by those bursts of bullets or shells, I could feel their ribs crushing. Then I would get up again and continue....<ref name="ICTY" />}}

When this witness climbed out of a window, he was seen by a guard who shot at him. He pretended to be dead and managed to escape the following morning. The other witness quoted above spent the night under a heap of bodies; the next morning, he watched as the soldiers examined the corpses for signs of life. The few survivors were forced to sing Serbian songs, and were then shot. Once the final victim had been killed, an excavator was driven in to shunt the bodies out of the shed; the asphalt outside was then hosed down with water. In September 1996, however, it was still possible to find the evidence.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Kravica Warehouse"/>

Analyses of hair, blood and explosives residue collected at the Kravica Warehouse provide strong evidence of the killings. Experts determined the presence of bullet strikes, explosives residue, bullets and shell cases, as well as human blood, bones and tissue adhering to the walls and floors of the building. Forensic evidence presented by the ICTY Prosecutor established a link between the executions in Kravica and the 'primary' mass grave known as Glogova 2, in which the remains of 139 people were found. In the 'secondary' grave known as Zeleni Jadar 5 there were 145 bodies, a number of which were charred. Pieces of brick and window frame which were found in the Glogova 1 grave that was opened later also established a link with Kravica. Here, the remains of 191 victims were found.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Kravica Warehouse"/>

==== 13–14 July: Tišća ====

As the buses crowded with Bosnian women, children and elderly made their way from Potočari to Kladanj, they were stopped at Tišća village, searched, and the Bosnian men and boys found on board were removed from the bus. The evidence reveals a well-organised operation in Tišća.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Tišca">{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=81 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

From the checkpoint, an officer directed the soldier escorting the witness towards a nearby school where many other prisoners were being held. At the school, a soldier on a field telephone appeared to be transmitting and receiving orders. Sometime around midnight, the witness was loaded onto a truck with 22 other men with their hands tied behind their backs. At one point the truck stopped and a soldier on the scene said: "Not here. Take them up there, where they took people before." The truck reached another stopping point where the soldiers came around to the back of the truck and started shooting the prisoners. The survivor escaped by running away from the truck and hiding in a forest.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Tišca" />

==== 14 July: Grbavci and Orahovac ====

A large group of the prisoners who had been held overnight in Bratunac were bussed in a convoy of 30 vehicles to the Grbavci school in [[Orahovac]] early in the morning of 14 July 1995. When they got there, the school gym was already half-filled with prisoners who had been arriving since the early morning hours and within a few hours, the building was completely full. Survivors estimated that there were 2,000 to 2,500 men there, some of them very young and some quite elderly, although the ICTY Prosecution suggested this may have been an over-estimation and that the number of prisoners at this site was probably closer to 1,000. Some prisoners were taken outside and killed. At some point, a witness recalled, General Mladić arrived and told the men: "Well, your government does not want you and I have to take care of you."<ref name="Krstic 2001 Grbavci Orahovac">{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=82 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

After being held in the gym for several hours, the men were led out in small groups to the execution fields that afternoon. Each prisoner was blindfolded and given a drink of water as he left the gym. The prisoners were then taken in trucks to the execution fields less than one kilometre away. The men were lined up and shot in the back; those who survived the initial shooting were killed with an extra shot. Two adjacent meadows were used; once one was full of bodies, the executioners moved to the other. While the executions were in progress, the survivors said, earth-moving equipment was digging the graves. A witness who survived the shootings by pretending to be dead, reported that General Mladić drove up in a red car and watched some of the executions.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Grbavci Orahovac"/>

The forensic evidence supports crucial aspects of the survivors' testimony. Both aerial photos show that the ground in Orahovac was disturbed between 5 and 27 July 1995 and again between 7 and 27 September 1995. Two primary mass graves were uncovered in the area and were named Lazete 1 and Lazete 2 by investigators.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Grbavci Orahovac"/>

The Lazete 1 gravesite was exhumed by the ICTY Prosecution between 13 July and 3 August 2000. All of the 130 individuals uncovered, for whom sex could be determined, were male; 138 blindfolds were uncovered in the grave. Identification material for 23 persons, listed as missing following the fall of Srebrenica, was located during the exhumations at this site. The gravesite Lazete 2 was partly exhumed by a joint team from the Office of the Prosecutor and Physicians for Human Rights between August and September 1996 and completed in 2000. All of the 243 victims associated with Lazete 2 were male and the experts determined that the vast majority died of gunshot injuries. In addition, 147 blindfolds were located.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Grbavci Orahovac"/>

Forensic analysis of soil/pollen samples, blindfolds, ligatures, shell cases and aerial images of creation/disturbance dates, further revealed that bodies from the Lazete 1 and 2 graves were removed and reburied at secondary graves named Hodžići Road 3, 4 and 5. Aerial images show that these secondary gravesites were created between 7 September and 2 October 1995 and all of them were exhumed in 1998.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Grbavci Orahovac"/>

==== 14–15 July: Petkovići ====
[[File:Srebrenica Massacre - Mass Gravesite - Potocari 2007.jpg|thumb|Delegates of the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) examine an exhumed mass grave of victims of the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre, outside the village of Potočari, Bosnia and Herzegovina. July 2007.]]
On 14 and 15 July 1995, another large group of prisoners numbering some 1,500 to 2,000 were taken from Bratunac to the school in Petkovići. The conditions under which these men were held at the Petkovići school were even worse than those in Grbavci. It was hot, overcrowded and there was no food or water. In the absence of anything else, some prisoners chose to drink their own urine. Every now and then, soldiers would enter the room and physically abuse prisoners, or would call them outside. A few of the prisoners contemplated an escape attempt, but others said it would be better to stay since the International Red Cross would be sure to monitor the situation and they could not all be killed.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Petkovci School">{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=86 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

The men were called outside in small groups. They were ordered to strip to the waist and to remove their shoes, whereupon their hands were tied behind their backs. During the night of 14 July, the men were taken by truck to the dam at Petkovići. Those who arrived later could see immediately what was happening there. A large number of bodies were strewn on the ground, their hands tied behind their backs. Small groups of five to ten men were taken out of the trucks, lined up and shot. Some begged for water but their pleas were ignored.<ref name="Krstic 2001 Petkovci School" /> A survivor described his feelings of fear combined with thirst thus:

{{quote|I was really sorry that I would die thirsty, and I was trying to hide amongst the people as long as I could, like everybody else. I just wanted to live for another second or two. And when it was my turn, I jumped out with what I believe were four other people. I could feel the gravel beneath my feet. It hurt.... I was walking with my head bent down and I wasn't feeling anything.... And then I thought that I would die very fast, that I would not suffer. And I just thought that my mother would never know where I had ended up. This is what I was thinking as I was getting out of the truck. [As the soldiers walked around to kill the survivors of the first round of shooting] I was still very thirsty. But I was sort of between life and death. I didn't know whether I wanted to live or to die anymore. I decided not to call out for them to shoot and kill me, but I was sort of praying to God that they'd come and kill me.<ref name="ICTY" />}}

After the soldiers had left, two survivors helped each other to untie their hands, and then crawled over the heap of bodies towards the woods, where they intended to hide. As dawn arrived, they could see the execution site where bulldozers were collecting the bodies. On the way to the execution site, one of the survivors had peeked out from under his blindfold and had seen that Mladić was also on his way to the scene.<ref name="ICTY" />

Aerial photos confirmed that the earth near the Petkovići dam had been disturbed, and that it was disturbed yet again sometime between 7 and 27 September 1995. When the grave here was opened in April 1998, there seemed to be many bodies missing. Their removal had been accomplished with mechanical apparatus, causing considerable disturbance to the grave and its contents. At this time, the grave contained the remains of no more than 43 persons. Other bodies had been removed to a secondary grave, Liplje 2, prior to 2 October 1995. Here, the remains of at least 191 individuals were discovered.<ref name="ICTY" />

==== 14–16 July: Branjevo ====
On 14 July 1995 more prisoners from Bratunac were bussed northward to a school in the village of Pilica, north of Zvornik. As at other detention facilities, there was no food or water and several men died in the school gym from heat and dehydration. The men were held at the Pilica school for two nights. On 16 July 1995, following a now familiar pattern, the men were called out of the school and loaded onto buses with their hands tied behind their backs. They were then driven to the Branjevo Military Farm, where groups of 10 were lined up and shot.<ref name="ICTY-233">ICTY, ''[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm Prosecutor vs Krstic, Judgement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075111/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}'', II, B, 5 (g) "[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5g 14 – 16 July 1995: Pilica School Detention Site and Branjevo Military Farm Execution Site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508011123/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5g |date=8 May 2009 }}", par. 233.</ref>

[[Dražen Erdemović]]—who confessed killing at least 70 Bosniaks—was a member of the VRS 10th [[Sabotage]] Detachment (a Main Staff subordinate unit) and participated in mass executions.

On this point, one of the survivors recalls:

{{quote|When they shot, I threw myself on the ground... one man fell on my head. I think that he was killed on the spot. I could feel the hot blood pouring over me....

Erdemović said that all but one of the victims wore civilian clothes and that, except for one person who tried to escape, they offered no resistance before being shot. Sometimes the executioners were particularly cruel. When some of the soldiers recognised acquaintances from Srebrenica, they beat and humiliated them before killing them. Erdemović had to persuade his fellow soldiers to stop using a machine gun for the killings; while it mortally wounded the prisoners it did not cause death immediately and prolonged their suffering.<ref name="ICTY-234" />
Between 1,000 and 1,200 men were killed in the course of that day at this execution site.<ref>ICTY, ''[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm Prosecutor vs Krstic, Judgement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075111/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}'', II, B, 5 (g) "[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5g 14 – 16 July 1995: Pilica School Detention Site and Branjevo Military Farm Execution Site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508011123/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5g |date=8 May 2009 }}", par. 236.</ref>

Erdemović testified that, at around 15:00 hours on 16 July 1995 after he and his fellow soldiers from the 10th Sabotage Detachment had finished executing the prisoners at the Branjevo Military Farm, they were told that there was a group of 500 Bosnian prisoners from Srebrenica trying to break out of a nearby Dom Kultura club. Erdemović and the other members of his unit refused to carry out any more killings. They were then told to attend a meeting with a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] at a café in Pilica. Erdemović and his fellow-soldiers travelled to the café as requested and, as they waited, they could hear shots and grenades being detonated. The sounds lasted for approximately 15–20 minutes after which a soldier from Bratunac entered the café to inform those present that "everything was over".<ref name="ICTY-244">ICTY, ''[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm Prosecutor vs Krstic, Judgement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075111/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}'', II, B, 5 (h) "[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5h 16 July 1995: Pilica Cultural Dom] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508011123/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5h |date=8 May 2009 }}", par. 244.</ref>

==== 14–17 July: Kozluk ====
[[File:Exhumation Site in Čančari valley.jpg|thumb|Exhumation of the Srebrenica massacre victims]]
The exact date of the executions at Kozluk is not known, although it can be narrowed down to the period of 14 to 17 July 1995. The most probable dates are 15 and 16 July, not least due to the geographic location of Kozluk, between Petkovići Dam and the Branjevo Military Farm. It therefore falls within the pattern of ever more northerly execution sites: Orahovac on 14 July, Petkovići Dam on 15 July, the Branjevo Military Farm and the Pilica Dom Kultura on 16 July.<ref name="ICTY-253">ICTY, ''[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm Prosecutor vs Krstic, Judgement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075111/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}'', II, B, 5 (i) "[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5i Kozluk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508011123/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5i |date=8 May 2009 }}", par. 253.</ref> Another indication is that a Zvornik Brigade excavator spent eight hours in Kozluk on 16 July and a truck belonging to the same brigade made two journeys between Orahovac and Kozluk that day.

Among Bosnian refugees in Germany, there were rumors of executions in Kozluk, during which the five hundred or so prisoners were forced to sing Serbian songs as they were being transported to the execution site.

==== 20–22 July: Meces area ====
According to ICTY indictments of Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić, on 20 to 21 July 1995 near the village of Meces, VRS personnel, using megaphones, urged Bosniak men who had fled Srebrenica to surrender and assured them that they would be safe. Approximately 350 men responded to these entreaties and surrendered.

=== After the massacre ===
[[File:ICMP-PIP.jpg|thumb|ICMP's [[Podrinje Identification Project]] (PIP) was formed to deal with the identification primarily of victims of 1995 Srebrenica massacre. PIP includes a facility for storing, processing, and handling exhumed remains. Much of the remains are only fragments or commingled body fragments since they were recovered from secondary [[mass grave]]s. The photo depicts one section of the refrigerated [[mortuary]].]]

During the days following the massacre, American [[Reconnaissance aircraft|spy planes]] overflew the area of Srebrenica, and took photos showing the ground in vast areas around the town had been removed, a sign of mass burials.

On 22 July, the commanding officer of the [[Zvornik Brigade]], Lieutenant Colonel [[Vinko Pandurević]], requested the Drina Corps to set up a committee to oversee the exchange of prisoners. He also asked for instructions where the prisoners of war his unit had already captured should be taken and to whom they should be handed over. Approximately 50 wounded captives were taken to the Bratunac hospital. Another group of prisoners was taken to the Batkovići camp (near Bijeljina), and these were mostly exchanged later.<ref name="trial-ch24">{{cite web|url=http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=24|page=24|title=The Events in and Around Srebrenica Between 10th and 19th July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223001/http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=24|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=11 June 2004}}</ref> On 25 July, the Zvornik Brigade captured 25 more ARBiH soldiers who were taken directly to the camp at Batkovići, as were 34 ARBiH men captured the following day.

'''Zvornik 7'''

The most famous group of seven men wandered about in occupied territory for the entire winter. On 10 May 1996, after nine months on the run and over six months after the end of the war, they were discovered in a quarry by American [[IFOR]] soldiers. They immediately turned over to the patrol; they were searched and their weapons (two [[pistol]]s and three hand grenades) were confiscated. The men said that they had been in hiding in the immediate vicinity of Srebrenica since the fall of the enclave. They did not look like soldiers and the Americans decided that this was a matter for the police.<ref>{{cite web|author=Preston V.

The prisoners said they were initially tortured after the transfer, but later were treated relatively well. In April 1997 the local court in [[Republika Srpska]] convicted the group, known as the [[Zvornik 7]], for illegal possession of firearms and three of them for the murder of four Serbian woodsmen. When announcing the verdict the presenter of the TV of Republika Srpska described them as ''the group of Muslim terrorists from Srebrenica who last year massacred Serb civilians.''<ref>[http://archiv.medienhilfe.ch/Projekte/BiH/Monitoring/IWPR/1996/mon_v2_14.htm Medienhilfe Ex-Jugoslawien – Monitoring Report – Media trial of the Zvornik Seven] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006140608/http://archiv.medienhilfe.ch/Projekte/BiH/Monitoring/IWPR/1996/mon_v2_14.htm |date=6 October 2007 }}</ref> The trial was widely condemned by the international community as "a flagrant miscarriage of justice",<ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/5/ex_yug/yug_pr10.htm UNHCR report -]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627152318/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/5/ex_yug/yug_pr10.htm |date=27 June 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohr.int/?p=55215 |title=Office of the High Representative Press Release – Zvornik 7 Verdict|date=15 December 1998|accessdate=28 April 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428094434/http://www.ohr.int/?p=55215 |archivedate=28 April 2017|author1=OHR |author2=OSCE |author3=UNMIBH |author4=UNHCHR}}</ref> and the conviction was later quashed for 'procedural reasons' following pressure from the international community.

===2002: First Republika Srpska report===

In September 2002, the Republika Srpska Office of Relations with the ICTY issued the "[[Report about Case Srebrenica]]". The document, authored by [[Darko Trifunović]], was endorsed by many leading Bosnian Serb politicians. It concluded that 1,800 Bosnian Muslim soldiers died during fighting and a further 100 more died as a result of exhaustion. "The number of Muslim soldiers killed by Bosnian Serbs out of personal revenge or lack of knowledge of international law is probably about 100...It is important to uncover the names of the perpetrators in order to accurately and unequivocally establish whether or not these were isolated instances." The report also examined the [[mass graves]], claiming that they were made for hygiene reasons, question the legitimacy of the missing person lists and undermine a key witness' mental health and military history.<ref>[http://www.slobodan-milosevic.org/documents/srebrenica.pdf Report about Case Srebrenica] – Banja Luka, 2002</ref> The [[International Crisis Group]] and the United Nations condemned the manipulation of their statements in this report.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,349957,00.html Imaginary Massacres?], ''Time'', 11 September 2002</ref>

On 30 September 2003, former US President [[Bill Clinton]] officially opened the [[Srebrenica Genocide memorial]] to honour the victims of the genocide. The total cost of the project was around $5.8&nbsp;million. "We must pay tribute to the innocent lives, many of them children who were snuffed out in what must be called genocidal madness", Clinton said.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3124642.stm |title=Clinton unveils Bosnia memorial |date=20 September 2003 |work=BBC News |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Wilkinson|first=Tracy|title=Clinton Helps Bosnians Mourn Their Men |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/21/world/fg-memorial21|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=21 September 2003}}</ref>

In the report, because of "limited time" and to "maximize resources", the commission "accepted the historical background and the facts stated in the second-instance judgment 'Prosecutor vs. [[Radislav Krstić]]', when the ICTY convicted the accused for 'assisting and supporting genocide' committed in Srebrenica".<ref name="RS commission report"/>

The findings of the commission remain generally disputed by Serb nationalists, who claim it was heavily pressured by the High Representative, given that an earlier RS government report which exonerated the Serbs was dismissed. Nevertheless, [[Dragan Čavić]], the president of Republika Srpska, acknowledged in a televised address that Serb forces killed several thousand civilians in violation of the [[international law]], and asserted that Srebrenica was a dark chapter in Serb history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=384060 |title=Otvaranje najmračnije stranice |publisher=[[Vreme]] |author=Tanja Topić |date=1 July 2004 |language=Serbian}}</ref>

On 10 November 2004, the government of Republika Srpska issued an official apology. The statement came after a government review of the Srebrenica commission's report. "The report makes it clear that enormous crimes were committed in the area of Srebrenica in July 1995. The Bosnian Serb Government shares the pain of the families of the Srebrenica victims, is truly sorry and apologises for the tragedy", the Bosnian Serb government said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1147&reportid=166 |title=Bosnian Serbs issue apology for massacre, AP, 11 November 2004 |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |date=11 November 2004 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref>

=== 2005: Republika Srpska Srebrenica Working Group ===

After a request by Ashdown, the RS established a working group to implement the recommendations of the report by the Srebrenica commission. The group was to analyze the documentation in the report's confidential annexes and identify all the possible perpetrators who were officials in the institutions of the RS.<ref name="RS Working Group">{{Citation|last1=Picard|first1=Michèle|last2=Zinbo|first2=Asta|chapter=The Long Road to Admission: The Report of the Government of the Republika Srpska|page=141|editor-last1=Delpla|editor-first1=Isabelle|editor-last2=Bougarel|editor-first2=Xavier|editor-last3=Fournel|editor-first3=Jean-Louis|title=Investigating Srebrenica: Institutions, Facts, Responsibilities|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|date=2012|isbn=978-0-85745-472-0}}</ref> A report on 1 April 2005 identified 892 such persons still employed by the RS, and the information was provided to the State Prosecutor of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the understanding that the names would not be made public until official proceedings had been opened.<ref name="RS Working Group"/>

The video footage (starting about 2hr 35 min. into the proceedings) shows an [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest blessing several members of a Serbian unit known as the "Scorpions." Later these soldiers are shown visibly abusing civilians physically. They were later identified as four minors as young as 16 and two men in their early twenties. The footage then shows the execution of four of the civilians and shows them lying dead in the field. At this point the cameraman expresses disappointment that the camera's battery is almost out. The soldiers then ordered the two remaining captives to take the four dead bodies into a nearby barn, where they were also killed upon completing this task.<ref name="Milošević transcript"/><ref name="publicinternationallaw.org"/>

The video caused public outrage in Serbia. In the days following its showing, the Serbian government arrested some of the former soldiers identified on the video.

===2005: UN Secretary-General's message to the 10th anniversary commemoration===

In his address to the 10th anniversary commemoration at Potočari, the UN Secretary-General paid tribute to the victims of "a terrible crime – the worst on European soil since the Second World War", on a date "marked as a grim reminder of man's inhumanity to man". He said that the first duty of the international community was to uncover and confront the full truth about what happened, a hard truth for those who serve the United Nations, because great nations failed to respond adequately. There should have been stronger military forces in place, and a stronger will to use them.

[[File:Boy at 2006 Srebrenica funeral.jpg|thumb|A boy at a grave during the 2006 funeral of genocide victims]]
Blame lay first and foremost with those who planned and carried out the massacre, assisted them, or harboured and continue to harbour them. However the UN also bore its share of responsibility, having made serious errors of judgement, rooted in a philosophy of impartiality and non-violence which, however admirable, was unsuited to the conflict in Bosnia; because of that the tragedy of Srebrenica would haunt the UN's history forever.

Rebuilding trust among the peoples of the region could only be done by persisting in the struggle for justice, without which there could be no reconciliation, and no peace for the families of the victims, nor for society as a whole.

The quest for justice remained incomplete while those charged with being the main architects of this massacre—Ratko Mladić and Radovan Karadžić—were still at large and had not been made to answer the charges against them before the International Criminal Tribunal. He called on all Bosnians to search for truth and reconciliation.

Even while addressing the crimes of the past, the most important obligation was to prevent such systematic slaughter ever recurring anywhere again. The world had to equip itself to act collectively against genocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The "responsibility to protect" had to be given tangible meaning, not just rhetorical support.

He committed the UN helping the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to rebuild a viable economy and secure a peaceful, prosperous future among the family of nations.<ref name=10thAnniversary/>

On 24 August 2006, the Sarajevo daily newspaper [[Oslobođenje]] started publishing a secret list of 892 Bosnian Serbs who had participated in the Srebrenica massacre and were believed to be still in positions of power at government and municipal level. The names of the individuals concerned were listed among 28,000 Bosnian Serbs reported to have taken part in the massacre by the official Republika Srpska report on Srebrenica. The list had been withheld from publication with the report by the chief prosecutor of the Bosnian War Crimes Chamber, Marinko Jurčević.<ref>Avdić, Avdo (24 August 2006).

=== 2006: Dutch Srebrenica insignia controversy ===

In December 2006, the Dutch government awarded the Dutch UN peacekeepers who served in Srebrenica an insignia because they believed they "deserved recognition for their behaviour in difficult circumstances", also noting the limited mandate and the ill-equipped nature of the mission. However, survivors and relatives of the victims condemned the move, calling it a "humiliating decision" and responded with protest rallies in The Hague, [[Assen]] (where the ceremony took place) and Bosnia's capital Sarajevo.<ref>{{cite news|title=Anger over Dutch Srebrenica medal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6207254.stm|work=BBC News |date=4 December 2006 |accessdate=8 January 2007}}</ref>

== Analyses ==

=== Role of Bosnian forces on the ground ===
In response to the suggestion that the Bosniak forces in Srebrenica made no adequate attempt to defend the town, the Report of the Secretary-General pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53/35—The Fall of Srebrenica,<ref name="UN report" /> delivered to the 54th session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 15 November 1999 states:

{{quote|476. Concerning the accusation that the Bosniaks did not do enough to defend Srebrenica, military experts consulted in connection with this report were largely in agreement that the Bosniaks could not have defended Srebrenica for long in the face of a concerted attack supported by armour and artillery. (...)

478. Many have accused the Bosniak forces of withdrawing from the enclave as the Serb forces advanced on the day of its fall. However, it must be remembered that on the eve of the final Serb assault the Dutchbat Commander urged the Bosniaks to withdraw from defensive positions south of Srebrenica town—the direction from which the Serbs were advancing. He did so because he believed that NATO aircraft would soon be launching widespread air strikes against the advancing Serbs.

479. A third accusation levelled at the Bosniak defenders of Srebrenica is that they provoked the Serb offensive by attacking out of that safe area. Even though this accusation is often repeated by international sources, there is no credible evidence to support it. Dutchbat personnel on the ground at the time assessed that the few "raids" the Bosniaks mounted out of Srebrenica were of little or no military significance. These raids were often organised in order to gather food, as the Serbs had refused access for humanitarian convoys into the enclave. Even Serb sources approached in the context of this report acknowledged that the Bosniak forces in Srebrenica posed no significant military threat to them. The biggest attack the Bosniaks launched out of Srebrenica during the more than two years during which it was designated a safe area appears to have been the raid on the village of Višnjica, on 26 June 1995, in which several houses were burned, up to four Serbs were killed and approximately 100 sheep were stolen. In contrast, the Serbs overran the enclave two weeks later, driving tens of thousands from their homes, and summarily executing thousands of men and boys. The Serbs repeatedly exaggerated the extent of the raids out of Srebrenica as a pretext for the prosecution of a central war aim: to create a geographically contiguous and ethnically pure territory along the Drina, while freeing their troops to fight in other parts of the country. The extent to which this pretext was accepted at face value by international actors and observers reflected the prism of "moral equivalency" through which the conflict in Bosnia was viewed by too many for too long.<ref name="UN report bosniac forces">{{cite web|title=Report of the Secretary-General pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53/35 — The fall of Srebrenica|url=https://undocs.org/A/54/549|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=15 March 2017|language=en|at=XI.

=== Disputed Serb casualties around Srebrenica ===
It is agreed by all sides that Serbs suffered a number of casualties during military forays led by [[Naser Orić]].

* ''The Chronicle of Our Graves'' by Milivoje Ivanišević, president of the Belgrade Centre for Investigating Crimes Committed against the Serbs, estimates the number of people killed at around 1,200.
* ''For the Honourable Cross and Golden Freedom'', a book published by the RS [[Ministry of Interior]], referred to 641 Serb victims in the [[Bratunac]]-[[Srebrenica]]-[[Skelani]] region.

The methodical planning and mobilization of the substantial resources involved required orders to be given at a high command level. The VRS had a plan to kill the Bosnian Muslim prisoners, as Bosnian Serb war criminal [[Dragan Obrenović]] confirmed.<ref>ICTY Outreach Programme, "Facts about Srebrenica", A Planned Killing Operation, p 6, undated – after June 2005 [http://www.icty.org/x/file/Outreach/view_from_hague/jit_srebrenica_en.pdf].

===Claim that the planning of mass executions in Srebrenica defies military logic===
During [[Radislav Krstić]]'s trial before the ICTY, the prosecution's [[military advisor]], Richard Butler, pointed out that by carrying out a mass execution, the Serb Army deprived themselves of an extremely valuable bargaining counter. Butler suggested that they would have had far more to gain had they taken the men in Potočari as [[prisoners of war]], under the supervision of the [[International Red Cross]] ([[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]]) and the UN troops still in the area. It might then have been possible to enter into some sort of exchange deal or they might have been able to force [[concession (politics)|political concessions]]. Based on this reasoning, the ensuing mass murder defied military explanation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=26 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

===Dutchbat===
On 13 July, "Dutchbat" expelled{{why|date=July 2015}} five Bosniak refugees from the United Nations compound. Later proceedings in Dutch courts have established legal liability of The Dutch State for the deaths of those expelled.

On 19 July 2019. The Dutch Supreme court ruled that Dutchbat was not liable for the fall of Srebrenica and not liable for the massacre. The Dutch state was liable for 10% for the 300 Bosnian man expelled from the compound.<ref name="auto"/>

Other problems within Haukland's staff included<ref name=Eraker/> lack of cooperation between "the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and the [[Pakistani]]s", according to Harald Valved ([[UNPROFOR]] [[military advisor]]). The 2002 report ''[[Srebrenica: a 'safe' area]]'' said that "The cadres consisted of clans of [[Norwegians|Norwegian]], Pakistani and Dutch military that were incapable of adequate mutual cooperation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juliagorin.com/images/niod/p3_c06_s003_b01.html|title=Srebrenica: Part 3, Chapter 6, Section 3|publisher=}}</ref>

In 2005 an unnamed officer on Haukland's multinational staff at Tuzla in 1995, disputed the claim by Haukland and the Norwegian [[Chief of Defence of Norway|Chief of Defence]], [[Arne Solli]], that the attack on Srebrenica was a surprise.<ref name=Eraker/> The officer said "We knew early on that the Serbs were amassing their forces around Srebrenica. At the end of June, Haukland informed the headquarters at [[Sarajevo]] again and again in regards to this".<ref name=Eraker/>

In 2006 it was reported that Haukland regularly informed Sollie about the conditions within Haukland's sector, and when Haukland departed Bosnia on his vacation to [[Norway]], they travelled on the same airplane.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytid.no/styrken_som_sviktet/|title=Styrken som sviktet|work=[[Ny Tid]]|date=13 July 2006|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>

The 2002 report ''Srebrenica: a 'safe' area'', did not assign any blame to Haukland for the massacre.

Sheehan|John Sheehan]], NATO's [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic]] from 1994 to 1997, told a US Senate hearing that the Dutch had "declared a peace dividend and made a conscious effort to socialise their military – that includes the unionisation of their militaries, it includes open homosexuality", claiming that gay soldiers could result in events like Srebrenica.<ref>{{cite news|author=Ian Traynor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/19/gay-dutch-soldiers-srebrenica?showCommentBox=true#post-area |title=US general: Gay Dutch soldiers caused Srebrenica massacre |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=3 June 2011 |date=19 March 2010}}</ref> He claimed that his opinion was shared by the leadership of the Dutch armed forces, mentioning the name "Hankman Berman", who Sheehan added, had told him that the presence of gay soldiers at Srebrenica had sapped morale and contributed to the disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V7Or0kbqY0 |title=General Sheehan: gays responsible for Srebrenica massacre |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref> General van den Breemen denied having said such a thing and called Sheehan's comments "total nonsense", Sheehan's remarks were also dismissed by the Dutch authorities as, "disgraceful" and "unworthy of a soldier".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2507443.ece/Former_US_general__gays_make_Dutch_military_weak |title=Former US general: 'gays make Dutch military weak' |work=NRC Handelsblad |accessdate=3 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322230137/http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2507443.ece/Former_US_general__gays_make_Dutch_military_weak |archive-date=22 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ian Traynor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/19/gay-dutch-soldiers-srebrenica |title=US general: Gay Dutch soldiers caused Srebrenica massacre |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=26 May 2011 |date=19 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7478738/Gay-Dutch-soldiers-responsible-for-Srebrenica-massacre-says-US-general.html |title=Gay Dutch soldiers responsible for Srebrenica massacre says US general |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=19 March 2010 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |first=Our |last=Foreign}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.javno.com/en-world/pm-slams-disgraceful-srebrenica-gay-comments/298611 |title=PM slams 'disgraceful' Srebrenica gay comments |publisher=Javno.com |date=19 March 2010 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019212358/http://dalje.com/en-world/pm-slams-disgraceful-srebrenica-gay-comments/298611 |archive-date=19 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8575717.stm |title=Dutch fury at US general's gay theory over Srebrenica |work=BBC News |date=19 March 2010 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref> Sheehan apologised to Dutch military officials on 29 March 2010, withdrawing his comments and blaming instead "the rules of engagement...developed by a political system with conflicting priorities and an ambivalent understanding of how to use the military."<ref>[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2010/03/ex-general_apologizes_for_dutc.html O'Keefe, Ed.

===Criticism of the 1995 UN Special Representative for the former Yugoslavia===
In 2005, Professor [[Arne Johan Vetlesen]] said "[[Thorvald Stoltenberg]]'s co-responsibility in Srebrenica boils down to that he through three years as a top broker contributed to create a climate—diplomatic, politic and indirectly militarily—such that [[Mladic]] calculated correctly when he figured that he could do exactly what he wanted with Srebrenica's Muslim population".<ref name="aftenposten.no">{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/---Stoltenberg-har-medansvar-for-Srebrenica-6363178.html|title=Stoltenberg har medansvar for Srebrenica|work=Aftenposten|date=5 August 2005|accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>

==More intervention and enhanced roles of NATO and United States==
{{one source|section|date=June 2020}}
According to historian David N. Gibbs, a key lesson the world learned is, "In the response to genocide, the use of military force is properly viewed as a first resort." Gibbs described the incident as giving "a new impetus to US hegemony" providing justifications for further interventions by the U.S. and the NATO.<ref>David N. Gibbs, "How the Srebrenica Massacre Redefined US Foreign Policy", ''Class, Race and Corporate Power'' (2015) 3#2 Article 5.

== Denial ==
{{Main|Bosnian genocide denial}}
[[Sonja Biserko]], president of the [[Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia]], and Edina Bečirević, the Faculty of Criminalistics, Criminology and Security Studies of the University of Sarajevo have pointed to a culture of denial of the Srebrenica genocide in Serbian society, taking many forms and present in particular in political discourse, the media, the law and the educational system.<ref>[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2638 Denial of genocide – on the possibility of normalising relations in the region] by Sonja Biserko (the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia) and Edina Bečirević (Faculty of Criminalistics, Criminology and Security Studies of the University of Sarajevo).</ref>

The scepticism ranges from challenging the judicial recognition of the killings as an act of [[genocide]] to the denial of a massacre having taken place. The finding of genocide by the ICJ and the ICTY, has been disputed on evidential and theoretical grounds. The number of the dead has been questioned as has the nature of their deaths. It has been alleged that considerably fewer than 8,000 were killed and/or that most of those killed died in battle rather than by execution. It has been claimed that the interpretation of "genocide" is refuted by the survival of the women and children.<ref>Alternative Views

| Genocide scholar [[William Schabas]] in his 2009 book ''Genocide in International Law: The Crime of Crimes'' summarises the legal opinions regarding the status of the atrocities committed in Srebrenica and throughout the Bosnian war, deeming them [[ethnic cleansing]] and not [[genocide]], stating that "Ethnic cleansing is also a warning sign of genocide to come.
