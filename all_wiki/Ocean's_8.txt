'''''Ocean's 8''''' (stylized onscreen as '''''Ocean's Eight''''') is a 2018 American [[heist film|heist]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Gary Ross]] and written by Ross and Olivia Milch. The film is both a continuation and a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s [[Ocean's (film series)|''Ocean's'' trilogy]] and features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Helena Bonham Carter]]. The film follows a group of women led by Debbie Ocean, the sister of [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]], who plan a sophisticated heist at the annual [[Met Gala]] at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City.

After the release of ''[[Ocean's Thirteen]]'' in 2007, Soderbergh stated he had no intentions of making a fourth film, citing his desire to have the series "go out on top". However, an all-female spin-off was announced in October 2015, and much of the cast signed on by August 2016. Filming took place from October 2016 to March 2017 around [[Manhattan]].

''Ocean's 8'' premiered at [[Alice Tully Hall]] on June 5, 2018, and was released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on June 8, 2018, 11 years to the day after the release of ''Ocean's Thirteen''. It grossed $297&nbsp;million worldwide and received a lukewarm response from critics, who applauded the cast but found the film undemanding and less consistent than the films in Soderbergh's trilogy.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

==Plot==
Newly paroled [[con artist]] Debbie Ocean ([[Sandra Bullock]]), the late [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]]'s younger sister, convinces former partner-in-crime Lou ([[Cate Blanchett]]) to join her in a new heist. They assemble their team: bankrupt fashion designer Rose Weil ([[Helena Bonham-Carter]]); jewelry maker Amita ([[Mindy Kaling]]), who is eager to move out of her mother's house; security hacker Nine Ball ([[Rihanna]]); street hustler and [[pickpocket]] Constance ([[Awkwafina]]); and profiteer Tammy ([[Sarah Paulson]]), who [[Fence (criminal)|fences]] stolen goods out of her suburban home.

Debbie plans to steal the Toussaint, a $150&nbsp;million [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] necklace, during the upcoming [[Met Gala]] and use film star Daphne Kluger ([[Anne Hathaway]]) as an unwitting accomplice. The team manipulates Daphne into hiring Rose and convinces Cartier to loan Daphne the Toussaint. They digitally scan the necklace to manufacture a worthless [[cubic zirconia]] replica. Tammy secures a job at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and gains access to the gala and also gets Lou hired as a nutritionist while Debbie leads Daphne to invite art dealer Claude Becker ([[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]), whose betrayal sent Debbie to prison, as her date. Lou confronts Debbie for planning revenge against Becker, but Debbie reassures her that it will not jeopardize their plan.

When Rose learns the Toussaint can only be unclasped by a special [[magnet]] carried by Cartier's security detail, Nine Ball enlists her younger sister Veronica's help in creating a duplicate. At the gala, Lou spikes Daphne's soup, causing her to run to the women's room, where Nine Ball has created a blind spot for the museum's security cameras. As the male Cartier's guards wait outside and Daphne vomits into a toilet, Constance deftly removes the necklace from Daphne's neck and sneaks it to Amita, who splits it into smaller pieces of jewelry. When Daphne reappears with the necklace missing, the museum is sealed and a search of the premises and guests commences. It ends, however, when Tammy "finds" the duplicate necklace. Constance slips the Toussaint pieces to the team to smuggle out, and Debbie plants a piece of it on Becker. After the heist, Daphne joins the ladies, revealing that she already knew about the robbery which she figured out by their actions. She asks for the eighth part in exchange for saving them from jail.

When the necklace is returned to Cartier's, the switch is discovered, and [[insurance investigator]] John Frazier ([[James Corden]]) is assigned to investigate. Having crossed paths with the Oceans before, Frazier immediately suspects Debbie, but her careful presence on the gala's video footage gives her an unbeatable [[alibi]]. Debbie tells Frazier she may know who stole the necklace. Daphne visits Becker and sends Frazier a picture of the jewel Debbie planted. To further frame Becker, Debbie hires actresses posing as elderly socialites to sell the Toussaint off piece-by-piece and deposit the money into an account in Becker's name. The police take Becker into custody.

As the eight celebrate their success, Lou reveals the heist's true target: while the gala was being evacuated, she and The Amazing Yen, an [[acrobat]] who worked with Danny, replaced a [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Met]] display of royal jewels with replicas, escaping with gems even more valuable than the Toussaint. With their shares of the score much larger than they expected, each member of the team goes her separate way: Amita travels to [[Paris]] with a man she meets on [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]]; Rose pays off her debts and opens her own store; Constance buys a spacious loft in the city and becomes a [[YouTuber]]; Tammy expands her business in stolen goods; Nine Ball opens a pool hall; Daphne becomes a film director (and is shown directing a lookalike); Lou takes her motorcycle on a cross-country road trip; and Debbie mixes and enjoys a [[martini (cocktail)|martini]] at Danny's tomb, knowing he would be proud of her.

Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised the cast (namely Bullock, Blanchett and Hathaway), saying, "''Ocean's 8'' is a heist caper that looks gorgeous, keeps the twists coming and bounces along on a comic rhythm that's impossible to resist.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s [[Owen Gleiberman]] said it is "clever enough to get by" and wrote "''Ocean's 8'' is a casually winning heist movie, no more and no less, but like countless films devoted to the exploits of cool male criminals, it lingers most...as a proudly scurrilous gallery of role models." He found Hathaway "commanding at every moment" and believed Bullock projected "the debauched insolence" and ideological drive of "a hungry criminal", but lamented the scarcity of impressive dialogue for Paulson and Blanchett, who "don't get a chance to create indelible characters".<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Gleiberman, Owen |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/oceans-8-review-sandra-bullock-1202830271/|authorlink=Owen Gleiberman|title=Film Review: 'Ocean's 8' |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation|Penske Business Media]]|date=June 5, 2018 |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}</ref> In ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', [[Ty Burr]] was more impressed by Blanchett's performance ("the Boss of This Movie") and said, apart from Hathaway, the film largely depended on the "established personas" of the actors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burr|first=Ty|date=June 6, 2018|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2018/06/06/the-bling-ring/xvYjbb4zpHYpacpmFYYFBI/story.html|title='Ocean's 8' is a different take on the bling ring|website=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=January 22, 2019}}</ref>

===Response from actors===
Kaling and Blanchett attributed the lukewarm reception to the dominance of male critics and a lack of diversity among mainstream film reviewers. In an interview with [[Yahoo! Movies]], Kaling cited actress [[Meryl Streep#Political views|Meryl Streep's criticism of Rotten Tomatoes]] and said, "There is obviously an audience out there who want to watch things like [''Ocean's 8''], what I work on, what Sarah [Paulson] works on ... I think white men, critics would enjoy [the film], would enjoy my work, but often I think there is a critic who will damn it in a way because they don't understand it, because they come at it at a different point of view, and they're so powerful, Rotten Tomatoes."<ref name="Shoard"/>

Several film journalists strongly disagreed with claims that the reception had been dictated by the gender and ethnicity of the critics. Guy Lodge, a chief film critic for ''Variety'', highlighted the fact that several female reviewers, including Emily Yoshida from ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Stephanie Zacharek]], concurred with the general lukewarm response.<ref name="Shoard"/> [[Justin Chang]], an Asian-American critic for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', argued that film criticism needed increased diversity, but "We negate the possibility of sympathetic imagination when we assume that someone’s particular affinity for a work of art will be dictated in advance by specifics of race, gender and age." He instead argued that the benefits would be a broader pool of talent and perspectives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-film-criticism-diversity-20180620-story.html|title=We need more diversity in film criticism, but 'Who is this movie for?' is the wrong question to ask|author=Justin Chang|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}</ref> Donald Clarke from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' pointed out that the film had received a "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a better score than ''Ocean's Twelve''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/men-shouldn-t-review-ocean-s-8-wrong-cate-blanchett-1.3534130|title=Men shouldn't review 'Ocean's 8'?
