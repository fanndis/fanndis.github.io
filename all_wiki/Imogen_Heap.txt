'''Imogen Jennifer Heap''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|m|ə|dʒ|ᵻ|n|_|ˈ|h|iː|p}}; born 9 December 1977)<ref name="independent-123">{{Cite news|last=Rigby|first=Tony|date=10 February 2006|title=Imogen Heap, Scala, London|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/imogen-heap-scala-london-6109572.html|url-status=live|accessdate=17 March 2009}}</ref> is an English singer-songwriter, record producer, and audio engineer. Her work has been considered pioneering in [[Pop music|pop]] and [[electropop]] music.

Born in the [[London Borough of Havering]], Heap became classically trained in piano, cello, and clarinet at a young age. She began writing songs at the age of 13 and, while attending boarding school, taught herself music production. After being discovered by manager Mickey Modern while attending the [[BRIT School]], Heap signed to independent record label [[Almo Sounds]] at the age of 18 and later began working with [[experimental pop]] band [[Acacia (band)|Acacia]] alongside [[Guy Sigsworth]] as a frequent guest vocalist. She released her debut album, an [[alternative rock]] record, ''[[iMegaphone]]'' (1998), with assistance from Sigsworth working as a producer on the album. However, as funding for Almo Sounds began to decline, Heap was dropped from the label. In early 2002, Heap and Sigsworth formed the [[Electronic music|electronic]] duo [[Frou Frou (band)|Frou Frou]] and released their only album to date, ''[[Details (album)|Details]]'' (2002). The duo broke up in 2004.

Heap released two singles in late 2004, "[[Just for Now]]" and "[[Goodnight and Go]]", the latter of which became her highest charting single on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Heap's second studio album, ''[[Speak for Yourself]]'', was released in 2005 on her [[vanity label]], Megaphonic Records, and was [[Music recording certification|certified gold]] in the [[RIAA certification|United States]] and [[Music Canada#Certification awards|Canada]]. "[[Hide and Seek (Imogen Heap song)|Hide and Seek]]", her most commercially successful single to date, was also certified gold in the United States and gained popularity after being used in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[teen drama]] television series ''[[The O.C.]]''. Heap's third studio album, ''[[Ellipse (album)|Ellipse]]'' (2009), peaked in the top five of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and received mostly positive reviews. This was followed by her fourth studio album, ''[[Sparks (Imogen Heap album)|Sparks]]'' (2014). In 2017, she reunited with Sigsworth as part of Frou Frou.

Heap developed the Mi.Mu Gloves, a line of musical gloves, as well as a blockchain-based music-sharing program, Mycelia. She also composed the music for the [[West End theatre|West End]]/[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]''. Over the course of her career, she has received two [[Grammy Award]]s, one [[Ivor Novello Award]], and one [[Drama Desk Award]]. In July 2019, Heap was awarded an honorary doctorate from [[Berklee College of Music]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Vanni|first=Olivia|date=8 July 2019|title=SideTrack: Blue Man Group, "Big Brother" Corey Brooks & Fessy Shafaat… and more|url=https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/07/08/sidetrack-blue-man-group-big-brother-corey-brooks-fessy-shafaat-and-more/|url-status=live|access-date=24 March 2020|website=Boston Herald|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Early life==

Due to being placed a year above children her age, Heap claims she did not get along with many people from the school and spent most of her time in the music room practicing piano.<ref name="futuremusic1" /> She stated, "In boarding school...I was mocked about the clothes I wore, the way I looked, whatever.

===1995–1996: Almo Sounds & Acacia===
After boarding school, she went on to study at the [[BRIT School]] for Performing Arts & Technology in [[Croydon]], [[South London]], where she first began regularly singing and writing songs due to loneliness. It was there that she recorded her first song to feature her vocals, "Missing You", which was released on the BRIT School's ''Class of 1994'' album and earned her attention from manager Mickey Modern after he saw her performance at a talent showcase.<ref name="westword" /><ref name="futuremusic1" /> After being introduced to [[Nik Kershaw]] by Modern, Heap recorded demos which were taken to [[Rondor Music Publishing|Rondor Music]]. A few months later, Heap signed her first record contract, aged 18, with independent record label [[Almo Sounds]].<ref name="telfullconnect" /><ref>{{cite web|title=ALMO Sounds on A&M Records.com|url=https://www.onamrecords.com/labels/almo-sounds|url-status=live|accessdate=5 May 2012|work=ALMO Sounds History|publisher=Leslie J. Pfenninger|quote=Imogen Heap's demo was given to Jerry Moss who offered a contract with Almo Sounds. She signed with the label in April.}}</ref>

During 1996, Heap began working with British [[experimental pop]] band [[Acacia (band)|Acacia]], which featured her future collaborator [[Guy Sigsworth]] and was fronted by the singer Alexander Nilere. While never a full member of the band, Heap was a guest vocalist and contributed to various Acacia singles and album tracks.<ref name="abcprofile">{{cite web |title=Imogen Heap |url=abc.net.au/rage/guest/imogen-heap/9649240 |website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |access-date=4 December 2020 |language=en-AU |date=16 June 2012}}</ref> Heap's first major live performance was as part of the line-up for the 1996 [[Prince's Trust]] Concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].<ref name="xtra2006">{{cite web |last1=Percy |first1=Shane |title=Music: Imogen Heap |url=https://www.dailyxtra.com/music-imogen-heap-21573 |website=[[Daily Xtra]] |access-date=4 December 2020 |language=en |date=24 May 2006}}</ref>

===1998–2001: ''iMegaphone''===
Heap's debut commercial single, "Getting Scared", was released in 1997. The song became the lead single from her debut album, ''[[iMegaphone]]'', and was included in the [[I Still Know What You Did Last Summer#Music|soundtrack]] for the 1998 horror film ''[[I Still Know What You Did Last Summer]]''.<ref name="sglist" /> She released her debut album, the [[alternative rock]] record ''iMegaphone'', on 16 June 1998 through Almo.<ref name="nytmesmerize" /> The record was made with several producers, including English musician [[Dave Stewart (musician and producer)|Dave Stewart]] and Sigsworth, and received some critical praise but was a commercial failure, as Almo did little to promote the album. Soon after Heap released the record, Almo Sounds was acquired by [[Universal Music Group|Universal]], forcing its artists to either move to other labels or be released. Heap was one of the artists who was dropped from the label, leaving her without a record contract.<ref name="westword" /><ref name="telfullconnect">{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8061156/Imogen-Heap-fully-connected.html |title=Imogen Heap: fully connected |accessdate=23 April 2016 |date=14 October 2010 |first=Naomi |last=West |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> ''iMegaphone'' had, however, been licensed from Almo Sounds to [[Aozora Records]] in Japan, who eventually re-released and re-promoted the album in January 2002, and included the bonus tracks "Blanket" and "Aeroplane".<ref>{{cite web |title=Imogen Heap - Being Free |url=http://www.funkyrebel.com/imogen/main.htm |website=Funky Rebel |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=December 2020}}

During her time as an unsigned artist, Heap appeared on two singles: "Meantime", a track written by her former [[Acacia (band)|Acacia]] colleagues Guy Sigsworth and Alexander Nilere for the soundtrack to the independent British film ''[[G:MT – Greenwich Mean Time]]'',{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} and "Blanket", a 1998 collaboration with British [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] band [[Urban Species]]. "Blanket" was Heap's first charting single, reaching number 56 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Urban Species featuring Imogen Heap |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/7471/urban-species-ft-imogen-heap/ |website=Official Charts |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref> The song would later appear in a 2005 sex tape of [[Limp Bizkit]] frontman [[Fred Durst]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Golby |first1=Joel |title=Keep rollin’: a look at Fred Durst’s directorial 'masterpieces' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/27/a-look-at-fred-dursts-directorial-masterpieces-the-fanatic-john-travolta |website=The Guardian |access-date=4 December 2020 |language=en |date=27 August 2019}}</ref> Heap appeared as a featured vocalist on two songs{{em dash}}"Dirty Mind" and "Rollin' and Tumblin'"{{em dash}}on the 2001 album ''[[You Had It Coming]]'' by English guitarist [[Jeff Beck]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harrington |first1=Richard |title=Jeff Beck: Still Moving Forward |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2001/03/16/jeff-beck-still-moving-forward/bf73c809-2ee8-4917-824d-382ff4b5b648/ |website=Washington Post |access-date=5 December 2020 |language=en |date=16 March 2001}}</ref>

===2002–2003: Frou Frou===
Heap had kept in contact with [[Guy Sigsworth]] (who had co-written and produced "Getting Scared" from ''iMegaphone''), and this led to the pair of them establishing the collaborative project [[Frou Frou (band)|Frou Frou]].

The initial concept for Frou Frou was Sigsworth's, and the project was to have been an album written and produced by her with each track featuring a different singer, songwriter, poet or rapper. Heap explains that Sigsworth invited her over to his studio to write lyrics to a four-bar motif he had, with one condition – that she include the word "love" somewhere. The first line she came up with was "lung of love, leaves me breathless", and the ''[[Details (album)|Details]]'' album track, "Flicks" was written. A week later, Sigsworth called Heap again, and together they wrote and recorded the future single "Breathe In".

On 4 June 2002, they released ''Details'', their first and only album to date. The album spawned the singles "Breathe In", "It's Good To Be in Love", and "Must Be Dreaming". The song "Let Go" was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film [[Garden State (film)|''Garden State'']].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bacle |first1=Ariana |title=Every song on the 'Garden State' soundtrack, ranked |url=https://ew.com/article/2014/07/15/garden-state-soundtrack-ranked/ |website=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=25 November 2020 |language=en |date=15 July 2014}}</ref>

In late 2003, after an extensive promotional tour of the UK, Europe, and the US, the duo was told that their record label, [[Island Records]], would not be picking up the option for a second album.

Heap and Sigsworth remain firm friends and have worked together since the project, including their temporary re-formation in late 2003, when they covered the [[Bonnie Tyler]] classic "[[Holding Out for a Hero]]" which was featured during the credits of the movie ''[[Shrek 2]]'' after [[Jennifer Saunders]]' version in the film. Frou Frou saw a resurgence in popularity in 2004, when their album track "Let Go" was featured in the film ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]'', the soundtrack of which won a [[Grammy]] award.

In a 2005 interview, Heap said of Frou Frou, "[It] was really like a kind of little holiday from my own work. Guy and I, we have always worked together, and then over the years, it became clear that we wanted to do a whole album together. It was very organic and spontaneous – just one of those wonderful things that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from either of us, and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see what I could do on my own. But I'm sure in the future, Guy and I will get back together to do another record, or to record a few songs together."<ref name="news.ucwe.com" />

===2004–2007: ''Speak for Yourself''===

In December 2003, Heap announced on her website that she was going to write and produce her second solo album, using her site as a blog to publicise progress.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

Heap recorded a rendition of the song "I'm a Lonely Little Petunia (In an Onion Patch)" for the seventh episode of the [[List of Six Feet Under episodes#Season 4|fourth season]] of the [[HBO]] drama series [[Six Feet Under (TV series)|''Six Feet Under'']], which premiered in August 2004.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Teti |first1=John |title=Six Feet Under: “The Dare” |url=https://tv.avclub.com/six-feet-under-the-dare-1798181576 |website=The A.V.

Heap set herself a deadline of one year to make the album, booking a session to master the album one year ahead in December 2004. She re-mortgaged her flat to fund production costs, including renting a studio at Atomic Studios, London (previously inhabited by UK [[grime (music)|grime]] artist, [[Dizzee Rascal]]), and purchasing instruments.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

At the end of 2004, with the album completed, Heap premiered two album tracks online, selling them prior to the album's release – "[[Just for Now]]" and "Goodnight and Go".{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In May 2005, Heap released the lead single from her forthcoming album, "[[Hide and Seek (Imogen Heap song)|Hide and Seek]]". The song earned immense popularity after being used to score the [[The O.C. (season 2)|season two]] finale of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[The O.C.]]'' on the same day as its release.<ref name="paperint" /> It peaked in the top-40 of the ''Billboard'' [[Digital Songs]] chart, eventually receiving a [[RIAA certification|gold certification]] from the [[RIAA]] and going on to be sampled in the song "[[Whatcha Say]]" by American singer [[Jason Derulo]], which topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Brandle |first1=Lars |date=10 November 2007 |title=In Synch: U.K. Labels Cross Atlantic For Film, TV, Ad and Game Placements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xw4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status= |format= |language=en |page=21 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |location=London |publisher= |access-date=5 December 2020 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=8 sampled tracks behind some of the biggest tunes |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5M1LctGZFMR54Pp4SxflyfB/8-sampled-tracks-behind-some-of-the-biggest-tunes |website=BBC |access-date=5 December 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gold & Platinum|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=Imogen+Heap#search_section|url-status=live|accessdate=3 November 2018|publisher=RIAA}}</ref> 

Heap released the album on a [[vanity label]], Megaphonic Records. The album was titled ''[[Speak for Yourself]]''.

===2011–2014: ''Sparks''===
On 14 March 2011, Heap started work on her next album, ''[[Sparks (Imogen Heap album)|Sparks]]'' (then unnamed), as fans sent in nearly 900 "sound seeds", or samples of everyday sounds such as a "dishwasher door", a "bicycle", or a "burning match". Heap said the concept for this album was to record one track over a two-week period every three months, with each song and video to be released immediately. According to her website, the album would be completed in roughly three years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://heapsong1.imogenheap.com/ |last=Heap |first=Imogen |title=Heapsong1}}</ref>

The first song, initially entitled "#heapsong1" and later retitled "Lifeline", premiered worldwide on 28 March 2011 via [[Ustream]]<ref>{{cite web|date=28 March 2011|title=Heapsong1|url=http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/13627483|url-status=live|accessdate=27 June 2013|website=Ustream.tv}}</ref> along with a live remix by [[Tim Exile]]. "Lifeline" was released on 30 March 2011 as a digital download from Heap's website and via [[iTunes]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and other digital retailers. Released alongside this was a 12-page 3DiCD package (a 3D virtual CD) including crowd sourced (and paid for) images, the instrumental version of the song, the "seeds and solos only" version, and "heap speaks seeds and solos" — an 18-minute commentary by Heap on how the sounds and solos were used in "Lifeline".

On 6 May 2011, Heap tweeted that she and [[deadmau5]] were working on a collaboration. The song was titled "[[Telemiscommunications]]" and included in deadmau5's sixth studio album, ''[[Album Title Goes Here]]''.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Heap|first=Imogen|date=6 May 2011|title=Hey, @deadmau5! ...|url=https://twitter.com/imogenheap/status/66600113350508544|url-status=live|access-date=27 September 2014|website=Twitter}}</ref>

===Film===
After touring for nearly two years straight for her album ''[[Speak for Yourself]]'', Heap continued her travels, this time with only a laptop and video camera on hand as she began her writing trip for her next album. Nine weeks later she returned to the UK with the beginnings of the award-winning ''Ellipse'' and footage (as requested by a fan to film the making of the album) from its quiet beginning. Back in [[Essex]], Heap hired Justine Pearsall to document the creation of the album. The film documents the creation of the album and the renovation of Heap's childhood home, including turning her old playroom into her new home studio. ''Everything In-Between: The Story of Ellipse'' was released in November 2010.

On 5 November 2010 at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], Heap conducted an orchestra including her friends and family as they performed an original piece composed by Heap and orchestrated by Andrew Skeet. Heap also worked with London Contemporary Voices at this time, a scratch choir formed for this concert, which continues as a new choir in its own right. It was the score to the concept film ''Love The Earth'', for which fans were invited to submit video footage highlighting all the qualities of nature to be selected and edited into a film. This performance was broadcast live worldwide.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In March, for the [[Birds Eye View Film Festival]] at the Southbank Centre, Heap, in collaboration with [[Andrew Skeet (musician)|Andrew Skeet]], composed an a cappella choral score for the first-ever surrealist film ''[[The Seashell and the Clergyman]]'' (Germaine Dulac, 1927), with the [[Holst Singers]], a programme repeated at the Reverb Festival at the Roundhouse in February 2012 and in the Sage, Gateshead.

Heap performed in the Film and Music Arena at [[Latitude Festival]] in 2011.

In 2014, filmmaker Christopher Ian Smith<ref>{{cite web|url=http://citizensmith.net/|title=Christopher Ian Smith. Filmmaker.|website=citizensmith.net|accessdate=3 November 2018}}</ref> made ''Cumulus'',<ref>{{cite web|title=CUMULUS|url=http://modernmovingimage.com/cumulus/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226100059/http://modernmovingimage.com/cumulus/|archive-date=5 September 2020|accessdate=3 November 2018|website=modernmovingimage.com}}</ref> an experimental documentary exploring key elements of Heap's background, personality, and music practice. Crafted entirely out of social media content and data created by Heap and her fans, ''Cumulus'' explores Imogen's digital footprint and identity as well as her relationship with fans. The film is available to view online.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/127819987|title=CUMULUS|date=14 May 2015|via=Vimeo|accessdate=3 November 2018}}</ref>

| quote  = I just love crafting and shaping sounds. Actually, many of the sounds that I work with start off as organic instruments – guitar, piano, clarinet, etc. But I do love the rigidity of electronic drums... I would record live drums, and then I would spend a day editing them to take the life out of them. I like to breathe my own life into these sounds, and I do try to keep the "air" in the music.

In the late 1990s, Heap's music was largely [[alternative rock]]. Her earlier songs were frequently compared in the media to those of fellow singer-songwriters [[Tori Amos]], [[Kate Bush]], and [[Alanis Morissette]].<ref name="hp" /><ref name="it">{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=Joe |title=Imogen Heap: "I Megaphone" |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/rock-pop-1.182933 |website=The Irish Times |access-date=5 December 2020 |language=en |date=14 August 1998}}</ref><ref name="nytmesmerize" /> However, after forming and subsequently disbanding the electronic duo [[Frou Frou (band)|Frou Frou]], whose work was mainly [[alternative pop]] and [[electropop]], her music became primarily based in [[Pop music|pop]], specifically [[electropop]], [[art pop]], and [[synth-pop]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Halle |first1=Karina |title=Interview: Imogen Heap |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2010/08/interview-imogen-heap/ |website=Consequence of Sound |access-date=4 December 2020 |language=I don't know my ins and outs of classical composers in any way, but I did learn that kind of counterpoint and harmony and how things fit with low instruments and high instruments, and maybe those things did seep into the way that I make "Pop" music. |date=13 August 2010}}</ref><ref name="npr200" /><ref name="nytsoundworld">{{cite web |url=https://nytimes.com/2006/12/10/arts/music/10play.html?ref=arts |title=A Universe of Artists Who Create Their Own Sound Worlds |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=10 December 2006 |accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="nytmesmerize">{{cite web |last1=Sinagra |first1=Laura |title=With Her Synthesizer, She Mesmerizes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/13/arts/music/with-her-synthesizer-she-mesmerizes.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=25 November 2020 |language=en |date=13 January 2006}}</ref> She has written, produced, and engineered most of her music on her own.<ref name="nytgeek" /> She has also stated that she rarely listens to music, but draws inspiration from [[TED (conference)|TED conferences]].<ref name="cosint2010" />

Heap plays a number of instruments, including [[piano]], [[clarinet]], [[cello]], [[guitar]], [[Drum kit|drums]], and the [[array mbira]].<ref name="metrosixty" /> She extensively uses manipulated electronic sounds as an integral part of her music. She also mixes ambient sound into her music and has commented that "certain sounds give the music a width and a space, and that's important."<ref name="news.ucwe.com" />

Heap states that her song lyrics come from personal experience, but are not straightforwardly confessional. She has stated, "Most of the time, the lyrics are kind of like my secret messages to my friends or my boyfriend or my mum or my dad. I would never tell them that these songs are about them or which specific lyric is about somebody. Often, when I sit down to write a lyric, it is in the heat of the moment, and something has just happened."<ref name="news.ucwe.com" />

Heap's fashion has also been noted as a trademark of hers.

===Legacy===
Heap has been regarded as influential in pop music, specifically in electropop, and in using technology in her music.

Heap is an advocate of using technology to interact and collaborate with her fans. In August 2009 she used [[Vokle]], an online auditorium, to take questions from listeners over video chat.<ref>{{cite web|title=MUSIC INTERVIEWS {{!}} Imogen Heap: Even The Kitchen Sink|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112440133|url-status=live|accessdate=5 September 2020|website=NPR}}</ref>

Heap also teamed up with Vokle to hold open cello auditions for her North American tour. She provided sheet music for "Aha" on her website and encouraged local fans to learn the part and audition live via Vokle. Heap would then pick the cellist to accompany her for that particular city – sometimes with the help of viewers and her puppet lion, Harold. In 2010 Heap opened her online auditions to singers and choirs and invited them to audition via submitted [[YouTube]] videos to accompany her on stage as she performed the song "Earth" from ''Ellipse''. The winner of each local show was also invited to do a 15-minute gig of their own. In the studio, the official album recording of "Earth" was made up of numerous vocal tracks.

In July 2011, Heap unveiled a pair of in-development, high-tech musical gloves called the Mi.Mu gloves (a name derived from an abbreviation of "me" and "music")<ref name="nprpaint" /> at the [[TEDGlobal|TEDGlobal conference]] in Edinburgh, Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|last=Aron|first=Jacob|date=11 July 2011|title=Imogen Heap's musical gloves mix sounds on the fly|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/07/musical-gloves-mix-sounds-on-t.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803100948/http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/07/musical-gloves-mix-sounds-on-t.html|archive-date=3 August 2011|accessdate=11 July 2011|website=New Scientist}}</ref> Inspired by the VAMP system developed by Elly Jessop at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s media lab, Heap set out to develop the musical gloves in collaboration with Thomas Mitchell, a lecturer in music systems at the University of the West of England, Bristol. The gloves combine sensors developed by 5DT and x-io Technologies with Shure microphones. Both Heap's and Elly Jessop's musical gloves are similar to The Lady's Glove, an earlier invention by the electronic sound pioneer [[Laetitia Sonami]], and the midi gloves used since 1989 by [[Steve Hogarth]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Hogarth's use of Midi gloves circa 1989|url=http://www.marillion.com/band/hogarth.htm|url-status=live|accessdate=4 August 2014|website=Marillion.com}}</ref> lead singer of [[Marillion]].<ref>{{cite web|date=19 April 2008|title=Marillion on Motormouth|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkOI7ZPhevc|url-status=live|accessdate=4 August 2014|via=YouTube}}</ref> While still in prototype stage, Heap used her MiMu gloves to record "Me the Machine", the first song created solely with the gloves.<ref>Heap, Imogen (30 July 2014). "Me The Machine". [http://imogenheap.com/link/198 imogenheap.com].</ref> The song was released on her fourth studio album, ''Sparks''.

==Charity==
In 2008, Heap participated in an [[Album (Music)|album]] called ''[[Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace]]'', which is an initiative to support [[Tibet]], [[Dalai Lama]] [[Tenzin Gyatso]] and to underline the [[human rights]] situation in Tibet. The album was released on 5 August via [[iTunes]] and on 19 August in music stores around the world.<ref>E-Online (22 July 2008) [http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b147502_sting_matthews_mayer_gamer_tibet_beijing.html Sting, Matthews, Mayer Gamer for Tibet Than Beijing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724212652/http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b147502_sting_matthews_mayer_gamer_tibet_beijing.html |date=24 July 2008 }}</ref> On 12 October 2008, Heap participated in "Run 10k: Cancer Research UK", placing fifth of the women in the actual run and raising over £1000 for the cause with the help of her fans.

In 2008, Heap was asked to perform at POP!Tech in Camden, Maine (US). There she performed selections from her then-forthcoming album ''Ellipse''. After her set and an encouraging plea for another performance later in the conference by the audience and organisers, Heap agreed. Having nothing else prepared, though, she decided to improvise a song on the spot with parameters (tempo, key) suggested by the audience. After the show, Heap was asked by a Poptech attendee if she would give the newly created piece of music to his charity. A "lightbulb" moment occurred in Heap's head and she saw the potential in doing these improvised pieces for local charities at each show during the tour she would soon begin.

The first of these songs materialised at Heap's show at [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] in London on 19 February 2010. Using the same parameters and audience participation from POP!Tech, Heap improvised a song titled, "The Shepherdess". After the show, Heap made the song available worldwide as a digital download on her website asking for donations per download. All proceeds went to the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] where Heap was diagnosed with [[osteomyelitis]] and underwent life-saving surgery as a little girl. Loving the concept, Heap rolled this out for her North American Tour, donating all the proceeds for each song to a local charity from that city.

In 2011, Heap played a benefit concert in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, to help rebuild the [[Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti]] High School following a [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|severe earthquake]] which destroyed a large portion of the city earlier in the year. The concert was held at the Burnside High Aurora Centre, also featuring performances from Roseanna Gamlen-Greene, and The Harbour Union including The Eastern, Lindon Puffin, Delaney Davidson and The Unfaithful Ways. It was her only New Zealand show for the year.<ref name="unlimitedfund">{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Vicki|date=28 April 2011|title=Lesson in acoustic generosity|work=Stuff|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/4934928/Lesson-in-acoustic-generosity|url-status=live|accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref>

On 4 June 2017, Heap performed at [[One Love Manchester]], a benefit concert organised by [[Ariana Grande]] in response to [[Manchester Arena bombing|the bombing after her concert at Manchester Arena two weeks earlier]]. She performed "Hide and Seek".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Other celebrity participants included [[Katy Perry]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Niall Horan]], [[Coldplay]], [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Pharrell Williams]].

===Live 4 X===
In 2010, Imogen Heap partnered with Thomas Ermacora of Bubbletank<ref>{{cite web|title=A do-tank for collaborative projects from Imogen Heap and Thomas Ermacora|url=http://www.thebubbletank.org/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624233928/http://thebubbletank.org/|archive-date=24 June 2013|accessdate=27 June 2013|publisher=The BubbleTank}}</ref> to organise a series of online charitable events called ''[[Live 4 X]]''.

The initial event was inspired by the [[2010 Pakistan floods]]. Triggered by monsoon rains, the floods left approximately one-fifth of the country of Pakistan under water, affecting over 14&nbsp;million people and damaging or destroying over 900,000 homes. Teaming up with [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Unite]] and Vokle.com, Heap and Ermacora created a webcast/online fundraiser to raise awareness and money for those affected by the floods. Hosted by comedian, creative, and internet personality [[Ze Frank]], the webcast included a series of conversations with [[Cameron Sinclair]] of [[Architecture for Humanity]], [[Gary Slutkin]], and Anders Wilhelmson, (and later [[Richard Branson]] and [[Mary Robinson]]) with live performances by musicians [[Ben Folds]], [[Amanda Palmer]], [[Kate Havnevik]], [[KT Tunstall]], [[Josh Groban]], [[Kaki King]], [[Zoe Keating]], and [[Mark Isham]].

The premise of ''[[Live 4 X]]'' thus established, Heap has since continued to refine the model, organize, host, and perform a number of charitable, live-streaming concert events. By integrating live entertainment with educated discussion and technology, ''[[Live 4 X]]'' became an effective charitable outreach tool.

Following the devastating [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami]] of 2011, Heap told [[Washington Times]] Communities journalist and recording artist [[Jennifer Grassman]] that she intended to continue organising ''[[Live 4 X]]'' events to benefit various charitable causes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Imogen Heap & Jennifer Grassman on Japan Tsunami / Earthquake Disaster & Live 4 Sendai|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcrvGdsGq08|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716004637/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcrvGdsGq08|archive-date=16 July 2015|accessdate=27 June 2013|via=YouTube}}</ref>

'''Catalogue of ''Live 4 X'' events to date:'''
* 31 August 2010 – ''Live 4 Pakistan'' raised funds for flood relief and recovery in that region. Musicians included [[Ben Folds]], [[Amanda Palmer]], [[Kate Havnevik]], [[KT Tunstall]], [[Josh Groban]], and [[Zoe Keating]]. In an ironic turn of events, Heap was kept from appearing on ''Live 4 Pakistan'' due to [[Hurricane Earl (2010)|Hurricane Earl]] which at the time was progressing along the [[East Coast of the United States|US eastern seaboard]]. Heap, stranded and unable to get an internet connection, later posted a video message as well as a performance of her song "Wait It Out" from ''Ellipse''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Live 4 Pakistan &#124; A live fundraising even to benefit victims of the 2010 floods in Pakistan|url=http://www.live4pakistan.tv|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525023400/http://www.live4pakistan.tv/|archive-date=5 September 2020|accessdate=27 June 2013|website=Live4pakistan.tv}}</ref>
