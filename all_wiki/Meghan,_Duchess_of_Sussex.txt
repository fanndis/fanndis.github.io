{{British Royal Family}}

'''Meghan, Duchess of Sussex''' (born '''Rachel Meghan Markle'''; August 4, 1981), is an American member of the [[British royal family]], a former actress and a [[celebrity philanthropist]].

Markle was born and raised in [[Los Angeles]], California. While studying at [[Northwestern University]], her early acting career began. However, she is most known for playing [[Rachel Zane]] in the American legal drama ''[[Suits (American TV series)|Suits]]'' from 2011 to 2017. Identifying as [[mixed-race]] and a [[feminist]], Markle has promoted [[gender equality]] and her lifestyle [[blog]], ''The Tig'', featured a column profiling influential women. She has also represented charity organizations and received recognition for her fashion and style, having released a line of clothing in 2016.

In 2017, Markle became engaged to marry [[Prince Harry]], retired from acting, closed social media accounts, and commenced attending public events with the British royal family. Upon [[Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle|their marriage]] in 2018, she became [[Duchess of Sussex]]. The couple have a son, [[Archie Mountbatten-Windsor]]. In 2020, they stepped down as senior members of the royal family and moved to her native [[Southern California]].
