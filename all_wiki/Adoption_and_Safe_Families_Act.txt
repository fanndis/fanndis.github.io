The '''Adoption and Safe Families Act''' ('''ASFA''', Public Law 105-89) was signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]] on November 19, 1997, after having been approved by the [[United States Congress]] earlier in the month.<ref name="nyt111797">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/17/us/clinton-to-approve-sweeping-shift-in-adoption.html | title= Clinton to Approve Sweeping Shift in Adoption | first=Katherine Q. | last=Seelye | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 17, 1997 | accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref>

==Background and passage==
ASFA  was enacted in an attempt to correct problems inherent within the [[foster care]] system that deterred the [[adoption]] of children with [[special needs]]. Many of these problems had stemmed from an earlier bill, the [[Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act]] of 1980,<ref name="nyt111797"/> although they had not been anticipated when that law was passed, as states decided to interpret that law as requiring biological families be kept together no matter what.<ref name="nyt111797"/> The biggest change to the law was how ASFA amended Title IV-E of the [[Social Security Act]] regarding funding.

Moreover, ASFA marked a fundamental change to [[child welfare]] thinking, shifting the emphasis towards children's health and safety concerns and away from a policy of reuniting children with their birth parents without regard to prior abusiveness.<ref name="nyt111797"/> As such, ASFA was considered the most sweeping change to the U.S. adoption and foster care system in some two decades.<ref name="nyt111797"/>   One of ASFA's lead sponsors, Republican Senator [[John H. Chafee]] of [[Rhode Island]], said, "We will not continue the current system of always putting the needs and rights of the biological parents first. ... It's time we recognize that some families simply cannot and should not be kept together."<ref name="nyt111797"/>

Ideas for the bill originated with both Democrats and Republicans.<ref name="nyt102900"/>  [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Clinton]] originally voiced interest in the issue of orphaned children in an article she wrote in 1995.<ref name="nfll">{{cite web | title = First Lady Biography: Hillary Clinton | url = http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=43 | publisher = National First Ladies' Library | accessdate = August 22, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060902082333/http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=43| archivedate=  September 2, 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>  She then held public events to bring the issue exposure,<ref name="nyt102900"/><ref name="nfll"/> and met with [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] officials and private foundation executives over policy questions and recommendations. She cited the Act as the achievement which she initiated and shepherded that provided her with the greatest satisfaction.<ref name="nfll"/>  The bill began in Congress with bipartisan support, then became contentious over issues of terminating birth parents' rights to children and funding levels for programs to keep children out of foster care.<ref name="nyt102900">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/29/nyregion/campaigns-soft-pedal-on-children-and-the-poor.html | title= Campaigns Soft-Pedal On Children and the Poor | first=Somini | last=Sengupta | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 29, 2000 | accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref>  Hillary Clinton played a key role in finding a compromise between Republicans and Democrats on the latter issue after negotiations first broke down.<ref name="nyt102900"/>

In greeting the final measure, Bill Clinton stated that the bill "makes clear that children's health and safety are the paramount concerns."<ref name="nyt111797"/>

==Major provisions and tactics==
The major provisions of the law include:
* Requires that States move to terminate parental rights for children who have been in Foster Care for 15 out of the last 22 months
* Exceptions to the 15/22 rule include:<ref name="hort">{{cite journal | url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2060&context=ulj | title=Is Twenty-two Months Beyond the Best Interest of the Child? ASFA's Guidelines for the Termination of Parental Rights | first=Katherine A. | last=Hort | journal=[[Fordham Urban Law Journal]] | volume=29 | issue=6 | year=2000}}</ref>
*# When the child is in a Foster Home with a biological relative (Kinship Care)
*# When the Agency documents a compelling reason why parental termination is ''not'' in the Child's best interest
*# When the State has failed to provide services necessary for reunification
* Requires that Permanency Hearings be held every 12 months 
* Clarifies cases in which States are not required to reunite Families (Aggravated Circumstances)
* Expands family preservation and support services
* Extends subsidies for adoptive children
* Provides incentives for States to improve adoption rates
* Requires States to document efforts to move children toward adoption
* Expands health care coverage for adoptive children
* Provides funding for efforts at encouraging adoption
* Clarifies that interstate boundaries should not delay adoption.

==Impact==
{{expand section|date=November 2020}}
The law required individual states to be in compliance with it in order to continue receiving federal funds for child welfare. Thus, each state had to pass legislation compatible with ASFA; in practice, those legislative actions varied widely. As a result, some states have relied upon the three exceptions in the law more as part of stressing reunification, while other states have stressed adoption.<ref name="hort"/>

Twelve years after the Implementation of ASFA, the Urban Institute's Center for Social Policy did a study reviewing the effectiveness of AFSA. In the study conclusion The Urban Institute declared that  AFSA had increased the amount of children leaving foster care, but that AFSA had failed to properly support blood relatives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.urban.org/research/publication/intentions-and-results-look-back-adoption-and-safe-families-act/view/full_report|title=Intentions and Results: A Look Back at The Adoption and Safe Families Act|last=|first=|date=|website=Urban Institute|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> AFSA's short comings discussed by the Urban Institute lead policy makers to create the [[Family First Prevention Services Act]]  which builds on ASFA's  policies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lindell|first1=Karen U.|last2=Sorenson|first2=Christina K.|last3=Mangold|first3=Susan V.|date=2020-03-01|title=The Family First Prevention Services Act: A New Era of Child Welfare Reform|journal=Public Health Reports|language=en|volume=135|issue=2|pages=282–286|doi=10.1177/0033354919900892|issn=0033-3549|pmc=7036616|pmid=31995716}}</ref>

=== One Million Adoptions Later: Adoption and Safe Families Act at 20 ===
It is beyond dispute that the trends envisioned by ASFA — more adoptions, and less foster care — have occurred. The number of youth adopted from care has steadily risen since ASFA’s passage: up from roughly 38,000 in 1998 to nearly 60,000 in 2017, according to federal data.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Adoption & Foster Care Statistics|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/research-data-technology/statistics-research/afcars|access-date=2020-11-16|website=Children's Bureau {{!}} ACF|language=en}}</ref>

This increase in adoptions has contributed to a decrease in the number of youth who stay in care for long periods. In 1998, the average time spent in foster care was 32.6 months. About a third of all foster youth lived in care for three or more years. By 2017, the average stay was down to 20.1 months, with 15 percent of youths remaining in care for three or more years.

It is difficult to tease out how much of this trend is attributable to ASFA. Some states had already passed similar legislation and national time-in-care statistics were already starting to decline.

“You see this relationship in other things we do, when trying to discern whether federal policy drives change or it’s already happening in the states,” said [https://www.c-span.org/person/?nickgwyn Nick Gwyn], current Democratic staff director for the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources. “I think it’s not one or the other. There was some movement in that direction, and that was accelerated with ASFA.”

The path to permanency from foster care has slowed <ref>[https://imprintnews.org/child-welfare-2/notes-federal-foster-care-report-permanency-delays-state-surges/ path to permanency from foster care has slowed]</ref> for the first time since ASFA’s passage, according to the federal data on foster youth, which was released this month{{when|date=November 2020}}. For the first time in decades, the number of children reunified with their parents is below 50 percent.

And while the number of finalized adoptions continues to increase – up 14 percent since 2012 and nearly reaching 60,000 in 2017 – the increase in adoptions has been significantly outpaced by the increase in kids being slated for that outcome. Since 2012, the number of youth deemed to be “waiting for adoption” is up 23 percent, from 100,379 to 123,437. And the percent of children in foster care whose parents’ rights have been terminated has also jumped in that time frame, up 20 percent.

=== Dissent and Regrets ===
Some critics of ASFA, and even the law’s principal crafters, contend that it didn’t do enough to lower the number of youth aging out of foster care. In 2017, 19,945 youth emancipated from foster care, while in 1998, there were 17,310 youth who emancipated. And, they say, ASFA should have put more resources behind keeping families together or reuniting them.

“The act’s financial incentives have disrupted families permanently by the speedy termination of parental rights, without the accompanying move from foster care to adoptive homes,” said Texas Tech University law professor [http://www.depts.ttu.edu/law/faculty/d_gossett.php DeLeith Gossett], in a report published in 2018 by the ''Memphis Law Review''. “The programs that the Adoption and Safe Families Act govern thwart its very purpose as children continue to languish in foster care waiting for permanent adoptive homes, often until they age out of the system into negative life outcomes.” “ASFA was blamed for leaving a lot of children as orphans and that certainly wasn’t the intention of ASFA,” she said. “There has been concern we moved to permanency but didn’t pay attention to the parent’s needs.”<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2018-12-09|title=Gossett, The Client (2018)|url=https://www.memphis.edu/law/documents/gossetttheclient.pdf|journal=The University of Memphis Law Review|volume=48|pages=|via=}}</ref>
