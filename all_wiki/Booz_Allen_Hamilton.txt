==History==
[[File:Fry_Booz_Hamilton_Allen.tif|thumb|Founding fathers from left to right: George Fry, Edwin Booz, Carl Hamilton, and James Allen]]
===Beginnings===
The company that was to become Booz Allen was founded in 1914, in Evanston, Illinois, when [[Northwestern University]] graduate [[Edwin G. Booz]] founded the ''Business Research Service.'' The service was based on Booz's theory that companies would be more successful if they could call on someone outside their own organizations for expert, impartial advice.<ref name="bah-hist">[http://www.boozallen.com/about/history Booz Allen History]. Boozallen.com. Retrieved on June 25, 2013.</ref> Booz's service attracted a number of clients, such as [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company]], Chicago's [[Union Stock Yards|Union Stockyards and Transit Company]], and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/booz-allen-hamilton-inc-history/|title=History of Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. – FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref>

During the following three decades, the company went through a number of name changes and business models, eventually settling to  Booz, Fry, [[James L. Allen|Allen]] & [[Carl L. Hamilton|Hamilton]], named after their partnership in 1936. Before Fry's departure in 1942, the company's name was changed again to Booz Allen Hamilton.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

=== Post-War era ===
In general, the post-war era saw a shift in the company's client pool, with many contracts coming from governmental institutions and different branches of the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].<ref name=":0" />

Edwin G. Booz died in 1951. The company received its first international contract two years later, in 1953, to help reorganize land-ownership records for the newly established [[Philippines]] government.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/spiesforhiresecr00shor|url-access=registration|title=Spies for Hire: The Secret World of Intelligence Outsourcing|last=Shorrock|first=Tim|date=2008-05-06|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781416553519|pages=[https://archive.org/details/spiesforhiresecr00shor/page/41 41]|language=en}}</ref>

The partnership was dissolved in 1962 and the company was registered as a private corporation. In 1998, Booz Allen Hamilton developed a strategy for the IRS to reshuffle its 100,000 employees into units focused on particular taxpayer categories.<ref name="irs">[https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2002/1125/190.html Booz Allen's Sweet Spot], November 24, 2002</ref>

In 2008, the commercial arm of Booz Allen split off to form Booz & Company. In 2013, Booz & Company was acquired by [[PwC]] and renamed [[Strategy&]]. Since then, Booz Allen has re-entered commercial markets. In 2010, Booz Allen went public with an initial public offering of 14,000,000 shares at $17 per share.

[[File:Booz Allen office in downtown Washington, D.C.jpg|thumb|Booz Allen office, Washington, D.C.]]

===SWIFT===
In 2006, at the request of the [[Article 29 Working Party]] (an advisory group to the [[European Commission]]), the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Privacy International]] (PI) investigated the U.S. government's [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program|SWIFT surveillance program]], and Booz Allen's role therein. The ACLU and PI filed a memo at the end of their investigation, which called into question the ethics and legality of a government contractor (in this case Booz Allen) acting as auditors of a government program, when that contractor is heavily involved with those same agencies on other contracts. The basic statement was that a conflict of interest may exist. Beyond that, the implication was also made that Booz Allen may be complicit in a program (electronic surveillance of SWIFT) that may be deemed illegal by the European Commission.<ref name="aclu">[https://www.aclu.org/safefree/spying/26808prs20060926.html Booz Allen's Extensive Ties to Government Raise More Questions About SWIFT Surveillance Program].

===Homeland Security===
A June 28, 2007 article in ''The Washington Post'' related how a United States Department of Homeland Security contract with Booz Allen increased from $2 million to more than $70 million through two no-bid contracts, one occurring after the DHS's legal office had advised DHS not to continue the contract until after a review. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the contract characterized it as not well-planned and lacking any measure for assuring valuable work to be completed.<ref name=oharrow/>

According to the article,

<blockquote>In a rush to meet congressional mandates to establish the information analysis and infrastructure protection offices, agency officials routinely waived rules designed to protect taxpayer money. As the project progressed, the department became so dependent on Booz Allen that it lost the flexibility for a time to seek out other contractors or hire federal employees who might do the job for less.<ref name=oharrow>{{cite news |last1=O'Harrow, Jr. |first1=Robert |title=Costs Skyrocket As DHS Runs Up No-Bid Contracts |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/AR2007062702988.html |work=The Washington Post |date=28 June 2007}}</ref></blockquote>

Elaine C. Duke, the department's chief procurement officer, acknowledged the problems with the Booz Allen contract. But Duke said those matters have been resolved. She defended a decision to issue a second no-bid contract in 2005 as necessary to keep an essential intelligence operation running until a competition could be held.<ref name=oharrow/>

According to Reuters, a source "with detailed knowledge on the matter" stated that Booz Allen's hiring screeners detected possible discrepancies in Snowden's résumé regarding his education, since some details "did not check out precisely", but decided to hire him anyway; Reuters stated that the element which triggered these concerns, or the manner in which Snowden satisfied the concerns, were not known.<ref name="Despiteresume">"[http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1266209/booz-allen-hired-snowden-despite-discrepancies-his-resume Booz Allen hired Snowden despite discrepancies in his résumé]".

=== Political contributions ===
In 2013 [[David Sirota]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' said that Booz Allen and parent company [[The Carlyle Group]] make significant political contributions to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as well as individual politicians, including [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]].<ref name="SirotaCashsecr">[[David Sirota|Sirota, David]]. "[http://www.salon.com/2013/06/18/how_cash_secretly_rules_surveillance_policy/ How cash secretly rules surveillance policy]". ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''. Tuesday June 18, 2013. Retrieved on June 27, 2013.</ref> Sirota concluded that "many of the politicians now publicly defending the surveillance state and slamming whistleblowers like Snowden have taken huge sums of money from these two firms", referring to Booz Allen and Carlyle, and that the political parties are "bankrolled by these firms".<ref name="SirotaCashsecr" />  According to Maplight, a company that tracked campaign donations, Booz Allen gave a total of just over $87,000 to U.S. lawmakers from 2007 to June 2013.<ref>Waterman, Shaun. "[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/21/surveillance-contractors-gave-millions-campaign-ca/ Surveillance contractors gave millions in campaign cash to congressional lawmakers]". ''The Washington Times''. Friday June 21, 2013. Retrieved on June 27, 2013.</ref>

According to CNBC, these contributions resulted in a steady stream of government contracts, which puts Booz Allen in privileged position. Due to the company's important government services, “the government is unlikely to let the company go out of business. It's too connected to fail”.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100804242|title=Booz Allen and the Big Business of Big Government|last=Carney|first=John|date=2013-06-11|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref> Furthermore, the influence Booz Allen carries in Washington isn't restricted to donations, but to a large network of lobbyists and political insiders. According to government watchdog OpenSecrets, “4 out of 6 Booz Allen Hamilton lobbyists in 2015-2016 have previously held government jobs”.

==Activities in foreign countries==
In June 2012 Booz Allen expanded its operations in North Africa and the Middle East, with initial plans to add operations in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates. It planned to later add operations to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, during a time when those countries, as stated by Jill R. Aitoro of the ''Washington Business Journal'', were "recover[ing] from the turmoil associated with the [[Arab Spring]]".<ref name=Aitoro>Aitoro, Jill R. "[http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/print-edition/2012/06/08/booz-allen-hamilton-expands-overseas.html?page=all Booz Allen Hamilton expands overseas footprint]". ''[[American City Business Journals|Washington Business Journal]]''. June 8, 2012. Retrieved on July 27, 2013.</ref> The Booz Allen employee base, when it was a part of Booz & Company, had long-term relationships with many North African and Middle Eastern countries; Booz Allen had split from Booz & Company<ref name=Aitoro/> David Sirota of ''Salon'' said that politicians in the United States who received financing from Booz Allen and "other firms with a similar multinational business model" have vested interests in "denigrating the democratic protest movements that challenge Mideast surveillance states that make those donors big money, too."<ref name=SirotaCashsecr/>

Booz Allen helped the Government of the United Arab Emirates create an equivalent of the National Security Agency for that country. According to David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth of ''The New York Times'', "one Arab official familiar with the effort" said that "They are teaching everything. Data mining, Web surveillance, all sorts of digital intelligence collection."<ref name=Sanger>Sanger, David E. and Nicole Perlroth.

Booz Allen has particularly come under scrutiny for its ties to the government of [[Saudi Arabia]] and the support it provides to the Saudi armed forces. Alongside competitors [[McKinsey & Company]] and [[Boston Consulting Group]], Booz Allen are seen as important factors in Crown Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman|Mohammed bin Salman]]’s drive to consolidate power in the Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/world/middleeast/mckinsey-bcg-booz-allen-saudi-khashoggi.html|title=Consulting Firms Keep Lucrative Saudi Alliance, Shaping Crown Prince's Vision|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}</ref> On the military side, Booz Allen is employing dozens of retired American military personnel to train and advise the [[Royal Saudi Navy]] and provide logistics for the [[Saudi Arabian army|Saudi Army]], but denies its expertise is used by Saudi Arabia in its [[Yemen War (2015-present)|war against Yemen]]. Additionally, it also entered an agreement with the Saudi government that involves the protection and cyber-security of government ministries,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blog.executivebiz.com/2018/03/booz-allen-saudi-arabia-partner-for-cyber-challenge-program/|title=Booz Allen, Saudi Arabia Partner for Cyber Challenge Program|work=ExecutiveBiz|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}</ref> with experts arguing that these defensive maneuvers could easily be used to target dissidents.
