Midland was founded as the midway point between [[Fort Worth]] and [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] on the [[Texas and Pacific Railway|Texas and Pacific Railroad]] in 1881. It is the hometown of former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]], and the onetime home of former [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]], and former First Lady [[Barbara Bush]].

[[File:Bank of America Building, Midland, Texas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Bank of America Building (Midland)|Bank of America Building]], Midland's tallest]]

Midland was established in June 1881 as Midway Station, on the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]]. It earned its name because of its central location between Fort Worth and El Paso, but because there were already other towns in Texas by the name of Midway, the city changed its name to Midland in January 1884 when it was granted its first Post Office.

Midland became the county seat of Midland County in March 1885, when that county was first organized and separated from [[Tom Green County, Texas|Tom Green County]].

By 1890, it had become one of the most important cattle shipping centers in the state. The city was incorporated in 1906, and by 1910 the city established its first fire department, along with a new water system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdm03 |title=MIDLAND, TX &#124; The Handbook of Texas Online&#124; Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) |publisher=Tshaonline.org |accessdate=2014-05-29}}</ref>

Midland was changed significantly by the discovery of [[oil drilling|oil]] in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in 1923 when the Santa Rita No. 1 well began producing in [[Reagan County]], followed shortly by the [[Yates Oil Field]] in [[Iraan, Texas|Iraan]]. Soon, Midland was transformed into the administrative center of the West Texas oil fields. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Midland was the largest bombardier training base in the country. A second boom period began after the war, with the discovery and development of the [[Spraberry Trend]], still ranked as the third-largest oil field in the United States by total reserves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/data_publications/crude_oil_natural_gas_reserves/current/pdf/appb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515062119/http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/data_publications/crude_oil_natural_gas_reserves/current/pdf/appb.pdf |archive-date=2009-05-15 }}</ref> Yet another boom period took place during the 1970s, with the high oil prices associated with the oil and energy crises of that decade. Today, the Permian Basin produces one fifth of the nation's total petroleum and [[natural gas]] output.

Midland's economy still relies heavily on petroleum; however, the city has also diversified to become a regional telecommunications and distribution center. By August 2006, a busy period of crude oil production had caused a significant workforce deficit. According to the Midland Chamber of Commerce, at that time there were almost 2,000 more jobs available in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] than there were workers to fill them.

[[John Howard Griffin]] wrote a history of Midland in 1959, ''Land of the High Sky.''

=== ''Avery v. Midland County'' ===
In 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court heard the case of ''[[Avery v. Midland County]]''. Midland mayor Hank Avery had sued Midland County, challenging the electoral-districting scheme in effect for elections to the County Commissioner's Court. The county districts geographically quartered the county, but the city of Midland, in the northwestern quarter, accounted for 97% of the county's population. A judge, elected on an at-large basis, provided a fifth vote, but the result was that the three rural commissioners, representing only three percent of the county's population, held a majority of the votes.

The majority of the U.S. Supreme Court held that the districting inequality violated the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[Equal Protection clause]]. The dissenting minority held that this example of the [[Earl Warren|Warren]] Court's policy of ''[[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]]'' at the local-government level exceeded the Court's [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] authority.

== Geography ==
Midland is located in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in the plains of [[West Texas]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 71.5&nbsp;square miles (185.2&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}), of which 71.3&nbsp;square miles (184.7&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) is land and 0.2&nbsp;square mile (0.5&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) (0.28%) is water.

=== Climate ===
Midland features a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'' or ''BSk'') with hot summers and cool to mild winters. The city is occasionally subject to cold waves during the winter, but it rarely sees extended periods of below-freezing cold. Midland receives approximately {{convert|14.6|in|mm}} of precipitation per year, much of which falls in the summer. Highs exceed {{convert|90|°F|0}} on 101 days per year, and {{convert|100|°F|0}} on 16 days.<ref name = NWS />

=== Cityscape ===
{{See also|Category:Buildings and structures in Midland, Texas}}
Nicknamed "The Tall City", Midland has long been known for its downtown skyline. Most of downtown Midland's major office buildings were built during a time of major [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] oil and gas discoveries. The surge in energy prices in the mid-1980s sparked a building boom for downtown Midland. For many years, the 22-story [[Wilco building|Wilco Building]] in downtown Midland was the tallest building between [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Today, the tallest is the 24-story [[Bank of America Building (Midland)|Bank of America Building]], which stands at a height of {{convert|332|ft|m}}. Four buildings over {{convert|500|ft|m}} tall were planned in the 1980s, including one designed by architect [[I.M. Pei]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/SARUP/faculty/cardillo.htm |title=List of Architectural designs, including MGF Building by I. M.

A private development group was planning to build [[Energy Tower (Midland, Texas)|Energy Tower]] at City Center, which was proposed to stand at 870 feet tall with 59 floors (six floors underground and 53 above). If it had been built, it would have been Texas' sixth tallest building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mywesttexas.com/top_stories/article_ac0f72d2-115e-598d-be9d-cc0d8ed838b6.html|title=Architect: 'Energy Tower starts ripple effect of downtown activity'}}</ref>
