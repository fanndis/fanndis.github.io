==Principles and policies==
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
The Māori Party was formed in response to the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy|2004 foreshore and seabed controversy]], a debate about whether [[Māori people|Māori]] have legitimate claim to ownership of part or all of New Zealand's [[foreshore]] and [[seabed]]. [[Tariana Turia]] resigned as a member of parliament for the Labour Party to form a party that would give Māori an independent voice from the two major parties. The party believed that:
*Māori owned the foreshore and seabed before British colonisation;
*The [[Treaty of Waitangi]] made no specific mention of foreshore or seabed;
*No-one has subsequently purchased or otherwise acquired the foreshore or the seabed; and
*Māori should therefore still own the seabed and the foreshore today.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hickford|first1=Mark|title=Law of the foreshore and seabed – Māori rights|url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/law-of-the-foreshore-and-seabed/page-2|publisher=e Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hickford|first1=Mark|title=Law of the foreshore and seabed – Challenge and controversy|url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/law-of-the-foreshore-and-seabed/page-4|publisher=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref>

* Māori ownership of the foreshore and the seabed{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP-->

==History==
===Formation===
[[File:Tariana Turia NZgovt.jpg|thumb|[[Tariana Turia]] resigned from the Labour government in 2004, becoming a founding co-leader of the Māori Party.]]
The Māori Party's origins can be traced back to the 2004 foreshore and seabed controversy, a debate about whether the Māori have legitimate claim to ownership of part or all of New Zealand's [[foreshore]] and [[seabed]], that arose during the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]]. A court judgement stated that some Māori appeared to have the right to seek formal ownership of a specific portion of seabed in the [[Marlborough Sounds]]. This prospect alarmed many sectors of New Zealand society however, and the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] foreshadowed legislation in favour of state ownership instead. This angered many Māori, including many of Labour's Māori MPs. Two MPs representing [[Māori electorates]], [[Tariana Turia]] and [[Nanaia Mahuta]], announced an intent to vote against the legislation.<ref name="Morgan Godfery pp. 240-241">Morgan Godfery, "Chapter 4.4: The Māori Party," pp. 240–241.</ref>

Turia, a junior minister, after being informed that voting against the government would appear "incompatible" with holding ministerial rank, announced on 30 April 2004 her intention to resign from the Labour Party. Her resignation took effect on 17 May, and she left parliament until she won a [[2004 Te Tai Hauauru by-election|by-election in her Te Tai Hauauru seat]] two months later. After leaving the Labour Party, Turia, later joined by Sharples, began organizing a new political party. They and their supporters agreed that the new organisation would simply use the name of "the Māori Party". They chose a logo of black and red – traditional Māori colours – incorporating a {{lang|mi|[[koru]]}} design, also traditional. The leaders of the Māori Party indicated that they wished to unite "all Māori" into a single political movement.<ref name="Morgan Godfery pp. 240-241"/> The party was formally established on 7 July 2004.<ref name=Ngatai2013>{{cite press release |last=Ngatai |first=George |title=George Ngatai – Standing for President of Maori Party – Speech |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1307/S00187/george-ngatai-standing-for-president-of-maori-party-speech.htm |date=16 July 2013 |agency=Scoop.co.nz |access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref>

===2005 election===
In the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 election]], the Māori Party won four out of seven Māori seats and 2.12% of the party vote. The latter entitled the party to only three list seats, so the fourth electorate seat caused an [[overhang seat]]. In the election night count, the party vote share was under 2% and the Māori Party would have got two overhang seats; when the overhang was reduced to one, National lost a list seat that they appeared to have won on election night. Tariana Turia held Te Tai Hauauru; [[Pita Sharples]] won the [[Tamaki Makaurau]] electorate; [[Hone Harawira]], son of [[Titewhai Harawira]], won [[Te Tai Tokerau]]; and [[Te Ururoa Flavell]] won [[Waiariki (New Zealand electorate)|Waiariki]].<ref>Morgan Godfery, "Chapter 4.4: The Māori Party," pp. 243–244.</ref>

===First term, 2005&ndash;2008===
In the post-election period the Māori Party convened a series of [[hui (Māori assembly)|hui]] to decide whether to support Labour or National, though some party leaders indicated they preferred to deal with Labour.  That day, however, Turia and Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] met privately and ruled out a formal coalition. Coupled with the support of the [[New Zealand First]], [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]] and [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressives]], Māori Party support would have given Clark just enough support to govern without the support of other parties. However, in the end, no deal was done and the Māori Party stayed in Opposition, citing that they were not prepared to compromise their positions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/event/story.cfm?c_id=1500891&ObjectID=10350828|title=Maori Party stays in opposition|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=18 October 2005}}</ref>

Gerry Brownlee, Deputy Leader of the National Party, claimed after the election that Labour and National each could rely on "57 seats" out of the 62 required in the 2005 election to govern. This implied that National had received support from United Future (3), Act (2) and the Māori Party (4) in addition to National's own 49 seats.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10350478|title=Coalition talks in chaos as Nats accuse Clark of failure|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=16 October 2005|first=Patrick|last=Crewdson}}</ref> Brash himself later supported this statement and claimed he had witnesses to it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/event/story.cfm?c_id=1500891&ObjectID=10351002|title=Brash: I had the 57 votes|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=19 October 2005|first=Audrey|last=Young}}</ref> This came after the National Party tried to woo the Māori Party in attempts to both see if a coalition arrangement was feasible and to counter any attempts which may have been made by Helen Clark.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/event/story.cfm?c_id=1500891&ObjectID=10349075|title=National courts the Maori Party|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=7 October 2005|author=Tony Gee, Audrey Young and Ruth Berry}}</ref> Tariana Turia denied this claim.

On 24 January 2006 the Māori Party's four MPs were jointly welcomed to [[Rātana pā]] with the leader of the National Party, Don Brash, together with his delegation of eight MPs. They had been intended to be welcomed on half an hour apart but agreed to be welcomed and sit together. Turia disputed claims that this was pre-arranged, saying: "We're here for a birthday. We're not here for politics."<ref>{{cite news |title=Taking partners for Ratana waltz |first=Haydon |last= Dewes |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |date=25 January 2006}}</ref> However critics said this would have reminded onlookers of how the Māori Party and National were said to be in coalition or confidence and supply talks. This may also have served to reinforce the Labour Party's election campaign statement that a 'vote for the Māori Party is a vote for National'. One Ratana kaumatua (elder) said this was deliberate and deserved after the talks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=280&ObjectID=10365240 |title=Parties forced to share stage at Ratana marae|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=25 January 2006 |first1=Jon |last1=Stokes}}</ref>

===2008 election===
In the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]] the Māori Party retained all four of the seats it won in 2005, and won an additional seat, when [[Rahui Katene]] won [[Te Tai Tonga]] from Labour. Two seats were [[overhang seats]]. The party's share of the party vote rose slightly to 2.39%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2008/partystatus.html|title=Chief Electoral Office: Official Count results: Overall status.}}</ref> The Labour Party won the party vote by a large majority in every Māori electorate, meaning that the typical Māori voter had split their vote, voting for a Māori Party candidate with their electorate vote and the Labour Party with their party vote.<ref>See Māori electorate results at [http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2008/electorateindex.html Chief Electoral Office: Official Count results: Electorate details].</ref>

The [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] won the most seats overall and formed a [[minority government]] with the support of the Māori Party, [[ACT New Zealand]] and [[United Future]]. Sharples was given the [[Minister of Māori Affairs]] portfolio and became an Associate Minister of Corrections and Associate Minister of Education. Turia became Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Associate Minister of Health and Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10543509">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10543509 |title=Key's Government |date=17 November 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |access-date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Hone Harawira was critical of the alliance with the National Party and was suspended from the Māori Party in February 2011. He left the party and formed the radical left-wing [[Mana Movement|Mana Party]] in April 2011.<ref>Morgan Godfery, "Chapter 4.4: The Māori Party," pp. 246–247.</ref>

===2011 election===
In the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]] the Māori Party was reduced from five seats to three, as the party vote split between it and Harawira's Mana Party. The Māori Party won three electorate seats.  With 1.43% of the party vote, the party was entitled to two seats, resulting in an [[overhang seat|overhang]] of one seat. The three MPs were [[Pita Sharples]] in [[Tāmaki Makaurau]], [[Tariana Turia]] in [[Te Tai Hauāuru]] and [[Te Ururoa Flavell]] in [[Waiāriki]]. [[Rahui Katene]] lost the [[Te Tai Tonga]] seat to [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]'s [[Rino Tirikatene]], and Hone Harawira won the [[Te Tai Tokerau]] seat for the Mana Party. The National Party again formed a [[minority government]] with the support of the Māori Party, ACT New Zealand and United Future. Pita Sharples again became Minister of Māori Affairs, and Sharples and Turia were ministers outside cabinet. With the retirement of Pita Sharples in 2014, Te Ururoa Flavell became the male co-leader of the party. Tariana Turia also retired in 2014.<ref>Morgan Godfery, "Chapter 4.4: The Māori Party," pp. 247–248.</ref>

===2014 election===
{{Further|51st New Zealand Parliament}}
Final results from the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014 general election]] gave the Māori Party two seats in Parliament. [[Te Ururoa Flavell]] won the [[Waiāriki]] electorate seat, and the party was entitled to one further list seat (to be occupied by the next person on the party list, [[Marama Fox]]) as they received 1.32% of the party vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Zealand 2014 General Election Official Results|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/new-zealand-2014-general-election-official-results|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]]|access-date=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613134004/http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/new-zealand-2014-general-election-official-results|archive-date=13 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===2017 election===
Prior to the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], the Māori Party formed an electoral pact with the [[Mana Movement]] leader and former Māori Party MP [[Hone Harawira]]. The Māori Party agreed not to contest [[Te Tai Tokerau]] as part of a deal to regain the [[Māori electorates]] from the Labour Party.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moir|first1=Jo|title=Hone Harawira gets clear Te Tai Tokerau run for Mana not running against Maori Party in other seats|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/89581527/hone-harawira-gets-clear-te-tai-tokerau-run-for-mana-not-running-against-maori-party-in-other-seats|access-date=7 October 2017|publisher=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|date=20 February 2017}}</ref> During the 2017 election on 23 September, the Maori Party failed to take any seats, with Labour capturing all seven of the Māori electorates.<ref name="2017 general election results" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/23/world/asia/new-zealand-election.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 September 2017 |quote=A major upset in Saturday's results was the vanquishing of the Maori Party, a group which grew out of protest action about indigenous rights to New Zealand's foreshore and seabed.

The party announced [[John Tamihere]] as its candidate for the [[Tāmaki Makaurau]] electorate in March 2020. Tamihere had held the electorate from 2002 to 2005, but for the Labour Party.

This allowed the Māori Party to enter Parliament, and with its party vote of 1.2%, it was entitled to two MPs.<ref name="results2020">{{cite web|date=2020-11-06|title=2020 General Election and Referendums - Official Result|url=https://electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2020/|access-date=2020-11-06|website=Electoral Commission}}</ref> After Waititi, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer entered Parliament as the highest-ranked person on the party list.<ref name="RNZ 6 Nov 2020">{{Cite news|title=Special votes: National loses two MPs, one each to Labour, Māori Party|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/430006/special-votes-national-loses-two-mps-one-each-to-labour-maori-party|access-date=2020-11-06|work=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=2020-11-06|language=en-nz|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106082134/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/430006/special-votes-national-loses-two-mps-one-each-to-labour-maori-party|archive-date=2020-11-06|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 11 November, former party co-leader Tamihere requested a vote recount in the [[Māori electorates]] of [[Tāmaki Makaurau]] and [[Te Tai Hauāuru]], alleging Māori voters  had encountered discrimination during the 2020 election. Tamihere claimed that the recount was intended to expose discriminatory laws such as the five-yearly Māori Electoral Option (which limited the ability of Māori to switch between the general and Māori rolls for a period five years). He also alleged longer wait times for Māori voters at election booths and some Māori not being allowed to vote on the Māori roll.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Burrows |first1=Matt |title=NZ Election 2020: Māori Party asks for recount in two electorates, pushes for Electoral Act reform |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/11/nz-election-2020-m-ori-party-asks-for-recount-in-two-electorates-pushes-for-electoral-act-reform.amp.html |access-date=13 November 2020 |work=[[Newshub]] |date=13 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113075414/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/11/nz-election-2020-m-ori-party-asks-for-recount-in-two-electorates-pushes-for-electoral-act-reform.amp.html |archive-date=13 November 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 26 November, Māori Party MPs Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer walked out of Parliament after the [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Trevor Mallard]] did not allow them to speak due to parliamentary procedures limiting the speaking time by smaller parties. Waititi had attempted to pass a motion that their party leaders be allowed to give a 15 minute "address in reply" but Mallard had blocked the motion on the grounds that MPs from smaller parties were not scheduled to give their maiden speeches until the following week. Waititi described Mallard's decision as unfair while Ngarewa-Packer claimed that this was "another example of the Māori voice being silenced and ignored."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Patterson |first1=Jane |title=Māori Party MPs walk out of Parliament in protest |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/431521/maori-party-mps-walk-out-of-parliament-in-protest |access-date=5 December 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=26 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129230930/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/431521/maori-party-mps-walk-out-of-parliament-in-protest |archive-date=29 November 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Leadership==
{{As of|2020|}}, the Māori Party's constitution states that must have two leaders, that its co-leaders must be drawn from its MPs first, and that one must be female and one male.<ref name=":0" /> These requirements have been in place since at least 2013.<ref name=":1" />

The party's first leaders were [[Tariana Turia]] and [[Pita Sharples]]. In December 2012, Tariana Turia announced she would resign as party co-leader before the 2014 election. Te Ururoa Flavell announced his interest in a leadership role, but as the Māori Party constitution required male and female co-leaders, he could not take Turia's place.<ref name=":1">"[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8171818/Ratana-unveiling-for-Turias-successor Ratana unveiling for Turia's successor?]". ''DominionPost''. 13 January 2013</ref> Shortly after this, in July 2013, Sharples resigned as co-leader, saying he would quit politics altogether come the next general election in 2014. He went on to say that "Our supporters deserve a unified party" which indicated that the leadership tension influenced his decision to resign as party co-leader.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pita Sharples stands down, Flavell likely successor |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/pita-sharples-stands-down-flavell-likely-successor-5483970 |work=One News |date=2 July 2013 |access-date=31 August 2014}}</ref> Flavell replaced him as the party's male co-leader. In the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014 general election]], Marama Fox became the party's first List MP, and – as the party's only female Member of Parliament – under the party rules automatically became female co-leader.

Following Rawiri Waititi's successful campaign for [[Waiariki (New Zealand electorate)|Waiariki]] at the [[2020 New Zealand general election]], he was confirmed as male co-leader, replacing John Tamihere, at a special general meeting of the Māori Party on 28 October.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/429357/maori-party-s-rawiri-waititi-replaces-john-tamihere-as-co-leader |title=Māori Party's Rawiri Waititi replaces John Tamihere as co-leader |work=RNZ News |date=29 October 2020 |access-date=8 November 2020}}</ref>
