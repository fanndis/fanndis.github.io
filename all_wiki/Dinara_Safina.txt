==Biography==
===Early life===
Safina was born in Moscow to [[Tatar]] parents. Her mother [[Rauza Islanova]] was her trainer when she was younger;<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/spanish-armada-sails-through-paris-713938.html|title=Spanish Armada sails through Paris|work=The Independent|date=June 6, 2000|accessdate=September 17, 2009|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity_interviews/Dinara+Safina-68442.html|title=Dinara Safina Prepares for Wimbledon|work=Female First|date=June 22, 2009|accessdate=September 17, 2009}}</ref> while her father is director of the Spartak tennis club in Moscow.<ref name="dsaf" /> Her brother [[Marat Safin|Marat]] is a former world No. 1 on the [[ATP Tour]]. Speaking of growing up in such a successful tennis family, Safina stated: "Being the little sister in such a big tennis family is not an easy situation. Maybe that's why it took me longer to develop. My father is very competitive, but my parents didn't put pressure on me. I wanted to find my identity. I wanted to be something by myself, like being a big player by myself. So at the beginning I was putting too much pressure on myself. But then gradually I found myself, and I learned how to do better with that situation."<ref name="Dinara Safina interview" /> At age eight, Safina and her family moved to [[Valencia, Spain]], and as a result Safina speaks fluent Spanish as well as Russian and English.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/sports/tennis/06tennis.html|title=With Yelp, Ivanovic Is in French Final|work=New York Times|date=June 6, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2009|first=Christopher|last=Clarey}}</ref>

===Playing style===
Safina is an aggressive baseliner who likes to take the ball on the rise with full power on every shot. Her sharp angled forehand can force a return that she can hit with a big and heavy forehand for a winner. Her backhand can be flat, heavy, and devastating. She boasts a powerful first serve that sometimes lacks consistency in tight moments. Her primary weakness is her mental toughness, particularly in Grand Slam finals, although it has improved. Her emotions on court can hurt her game. A tenacious fighter, Safina made several notable comebacks, including at the 2008 French Open: down 6–7, 2–5 against Maria Sharapova, she fought off match point and won 6–7, 7–6, 6–2. She was also regarded as one of the most healthy and fit players on tour. Though an adequate lateral mover, she is less nimble moving forward and tends to avoid net play.

Previously, Safina was coached by Glen Schaap,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/australianopen/2306103/Safina-has-old-guard-in-sights.html|title=Safina has old guard in sights|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=January 14, 2007|accessdate=September 17, 2009|location=London|first=Clive|last=White}}</ref> former coach of [[Anna Chakvetadze]] and [[Nadia Petrova]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/notebook?page=notebook/tennis08282008|title=Coin's win an upset of epic historical proportions|work=ESPN Tennis|date=August 28, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2009}}</ref> and [[Željko Krajan]], who worked with her during her rise to No. 1 in 2009.<ref name="Dinara Safina interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisconfidential.com/dinara-safina-interview.htm|title=NOT JUST A LITTLE SISTER ANYMORE|work=Paul Fein's Tennis Confidential|date=December 2008|accessdate=January 28, 2010}}</ref> From May 2010, she began working with [[Gastón Etlis]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/safina-humiliated-by-39yearold-who-sat-out-game-for-12-years-1982711.html|title=Safina humiliated by 39-year-old who sat out game for 12 years|author=Paul Newman|work=The Independent|date=May 2010|accessdate=May 28, 2010|location=London}}</ref> Their partnership ended after several months and in February 2011 she begun working with [[Davide Sanguinetti]].

She made the third final of her career and first off of clay in October at [[Fortis Championships Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], losing to [[Alicia Molik]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/tennis/wtatour/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=international_feed/04/10/31/TENNIS_Lux-Luxembourg.html&YEAR=2004|title=Molik does it again|work=sportinglife.com|accessdate=January 28, 2010}}</ref> She finished the season as world No. 44, her first time finishing in the world's top 50.<ref name="WTA_Activity"/>

Safina next competed at [[2011 BNP Paribas Open|BNP Paribas Open]], where she reached the fourth round, including wins over 26th seed Daniela Hantuchová and world No. 4 Samantha Stosur. Her run came to an end against Maria Sharapova in the fourth round. Safina announced she would not compete for the rest of 2011 because of a persistent back injury (stress fracture).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dinarasafina.com/bg.php/?p=582|title=Off-season Blog – 12/13/10|date=December 13, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004004549/http://www.dinarasafina.com/bg.php/?p=582|archive-date=October 4, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Safina allegedly retired from professional tennis, as announced by her brother Marat Safin, on October 7, 2011: "Dinara has decided to end her career," Safin said. "She has taken the decision relatively well. She considers it just to be the end of a period in her life." Safin said the main reason for his 25-year-old sister's retirement was a chronic back injury. "Everything is all right with her health. She feels good in everyday life, but (the back injury means) she simply can't play tennis professionally any more."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/former-world-no1-dinara-safina-retires-from-professional-tennis-with-due-to-chronic-back-injury/story-e6frf4mu-1226161618647|work=AFP|title=Former world No.1 Dinara Safina retires from professional tennis with due to chronic back injury|date=October 7, 2011}}</ref> However, Dinara Safina herself later that day issued a [[Twitter]] message, where she said she had not made any retirement decision yet, and that she needed more time to decide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/tennis/story/_/id/7072584/dinara-safina-not-ready-make-retirement-decision|title=Dinara Safina undecided on retirement|publisher=Associated Press|date=October 7, 2011|accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>
