Ukrainian literature mostly developed under foreign domination over [[Ukraine|Ukrainian territories]]. At times Ukrainian language was partly [[Chronology of Ukrainian language suppression|outlawed]] in oral and print form from 17th to early 21st{{fact|date=September 2020}} century. However, foreign rule by the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Austria-Hungary Empire]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]], enriched Ukrainian culture and language, and Ukrainian authors were able to produce a rich literary heritage.

== Ukrainian literature’s precursor: writings in Old-Church Slavonic and Latin in Ukraine ==
Prior to the establishment of Ukrainian literature in 1700s, many authors from Ukraine wrote in "scholarly" languages of middle-ages - [[Latin]] and [[Old Church Slavonic|Old-Church Slavonic]]. Among prominent authors from Ukraine who wrote in Latin and Old-Church Slavonic are [[Gregory Skovoroda|Hryhorii Skovoroda]], [[Yuriy Drohobych]], [[Sebastian Fabian Klonowic|Sebastian Klenovych]], [[Stanisław Orżechowski Roxolan|Stanislav Orikhovsky-Roxolan]], [[Theophan Prokopovich|Feofan Prokopovych]], {{ill|Jan-Toma Yuzefovych|pl|Jan Tomasz Józefowicz}}, {{ill|Pavlo Rusyn-Krosnyanyn|pl|Paweł z Krosna}} and others.

== The beginnings of oral Ukrainian literature ==

During this period of history there was a higher number of elementary schools per population in the Hetmanate than in either neighboring [[Muscovy]] or [[Poland]].  In the 1740s, of 1,099 settlements within seven regimental districts, as many as 866 had primary schools.<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul Robert|last=Magocsi|authorlink=Paul Robert Magocsi|year=1996|title=A History of Ukraine|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=[[Toronto]]|isbn=0-8020-0830-5|page= 285}}</ref> The German visitor to the Hetmanate, writing in 1720, commented on how the son of Hetman [[Danylo Apostol]], who had never left [[Ukraine]], was fluent in the Latin, Italian, French, German, Polish and Russian languages<ref>Volodymyr Sichynsky (1953).  ''Ukraine in foreign comments and descriptions from the VIth to XXth century''.  New York: Ukrainian Congress Committee of America</ref>

Late 16th and early 17th century included the rise folk epics called ''[[Duma (epic)|dumy]]''. These songs celebrated the activities of the [[Cossacks]] and were oral retellings of major Ukrainian historical events in modern Ukrainian language (i.e., not in Old-Church Slavonic). This period produced [[Ostap Veresai]], a renowned [[minstrel]] and [[kobzar]] from [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava province]], Ukraine.

== The beginnings of written Ukrainian literature ==
The establishment of Ukrainian literature is believed to have been triggered by the publishing of a widely successful poem ''Eneida'' by [[Ivan Kotliarevsky]] in 1798, which is one of the first instances of a printed literary work written in modern Ukrainian language.<ref name="BT_1"/><ref name="BT_2"/> Due to Kotliarevsky's role as the inaugurator of Ukrainian literature, among literary critics he is often referred to as "the father of Ukrainian literature".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbeKDwAAQBAJ Parody and Burlesque] // Hardie, Philip.

=== Iryna Vilde ===

Ukrainian writer [[Iryna Vilde]] (pseudonym of Daryna Dmytrivna Makohon) was born on 5 May 1907 in Czernowitz (Chernivtsi), Austro-Hungarian monarchy and died on 30 October 1982 in Lviv. Her father was Dmytro Makohon, a lecturer and writer on folk arts. She graduated from Lviv University in 1932. She was married to [[:uk:Полотнюк Євген|Eugene Polotnyuk]].

From 1930 to 1939 she published short stories and novels about the life of Western Ukrainian intelligentsia, the petty bourgeoisie and students. In 1935 she, for the first time under the pseudonym "Iryna Vilde" published the novel "The Butterflies in high heels" (Ukrainian "Meteliki na shpilkah").

After the reunification of Western Ukraine with Ukrainian SSR, she continued to describe the familiar themes of family in bourgeois society. She is the author of many short stories, novellas and novels. Her work contain a huge number of characters – protagonists from all public layers of the then Galicia – of the clergy, employees, workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, as well as information on the activities of various parties and public organizations, the Polish administration policy, the economy, education and the culture.

Some of her work are: The collection of short stories "Bizarre Heart" (1936), the story "Adult Children" (1939), a collection of lyrical miniatures "Okrushyny" (1969), the trilogy "Butterflies heels" (2007), novels "Adult Children" (1952), "Sisters Richynski" (Book 1 – 1958 book 2 – 1964), the trilogy "Butterflies on hairpins" (2007). "Sisters Richynski" is considered to be her most creative achievement.

== Contemporary literature ==
{{main|Contemporary Ukrainian literature}}

Since the late 1980s, and particularly after the independence of Ukraine (1991) and disappearance of Soviet censorship the whole generation of writers emerged: [[Moysey Fishbein]], [[Yuri Andrukhovych]], [[Serhiy Zhadan]], [[Oksana Zabuzhko]], [[Oleksandr Irvanets]], [[Izdryk]], [[Maria Matios]], [[Ihor Pavlyuk]] and many others. Many of them are considered to be "postmodernists".

At the same time the post-neoclassical literary trend has grown where the main figures are [[Igor Kaczurowskyj]] (d. 2013) and [[Maksym Strikha]].
