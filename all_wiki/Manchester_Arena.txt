The '''Manchester Arena''', known as the '''AO Arena''' for sponsorship reasons, is an indoor arena in [[Manchester]], England, immediately north of the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] and partly above [[Manchester Victoria station]] in [[air rights]] space.

The arena has the highest [[seating capacity]] of any indoor venue in the United Kingdom, and [[List of indoor arenas in Europe|second largest in Europe]] with a capacity of 21,000 and is one of the world's busiest indoor arenas, hosting music and sporting events such as boxing and swimming.<ref name="smgeurope">{{cite web|url=http://www.smg-europe.com/venue-profile.php?iVenuesId=8 |title=Manchester Evening News arena |publisher=smg-europe.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210165419/http://www.smg-europe.com/venue-profile.php?iVenuesId=8 |archive-date=10 February 2009 }} Retrieved on 28 March 2008.</ref> The arena was a key part of Manchester's bids to host the [[Olympic Games]] in 1996 and [[Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] and was eventually used for the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]].

The arena was temporarily closed following [[Manchester Arena bombing|a terror attack by a suicide bomber on 22 May 2017]], in which a suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured 500 more at the end of an [[Ariana Grande]] concert during her [[Dangerous Woman Tour]]. Shows that were scheduled to be at the arena were either moved to alternative venues, or cancelled completely. The arena was reopened on 9 September with a special [[benefit concert]] headlined by Manchester-born singer [[Noel Gallagher]].

==Arena design==
[[File:MEN Arena, Manchester (7263927380).jpg|thumb|left|Steps leading to southern entrance from Hunts Bank]]
First proposed during the regeneration of Manchester city centre during the 1980s, the structure was designed by DLA Ellerbe Beckett, [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup & Partners]], and [[Austin-Smith:Lord]]. The arena is sited in [[air rights]] space over the Manchester Victoria railway station and was constructed without disrupting use of the station. The original plans included a glass tower which was not built. It originally hosted a seven-screen multiplex cinema, a multi-purpose arena and multi-storey parking. The former multiplex cinema, which opened in 1996, closed after just four years and is now a [[call centre]]. Following the bombing, the foyer underwent renovation.

A large truss measuring {{convert|105|m|ft}} spans the roof. [[Reinforced concrete]] is used to increase sound insulation. The upper parts of the building are clad in purple-grey with green glass.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hartwell|2002|p=237}}</ref> The arena was opened on 15 July 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arena ready for Wets sell-out|first=Janine|last=Watson|date=25 July 1995|work=Manchester Evening News}}</ref>

The arena was one of the first indoor venues in Europe to be built following layout of 360-degree seating,<ref>{{Cite news |title=The Arena put Manchester on top of the world |last=Taylor |first=Paul |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/life_and_style/s/1301523_the_arena_put_manchester_on_top_of_the_world |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=13 July 2010 |access-date=6 July 2011}}</ref> and is the only arena in the UK to have this feature (London's [[The O2 Arena|The O2]], formerly the [[Millennium Dome]], also has 360-degree seating, but only on its lower tier, whereas Manchester's arena features it on both tiers). Other European indoor venues built to the same concept include the [[Lanxess Arena]] ([[Cologne]], [[Germany]]), [[Arena Zagreb]] ([[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]), [[Spaladium Arena]] ([[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Croatia]]), [[Kombank Arena]] ([[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]), [[O2 Arena (Prague)|O2 Arena]] ([[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]), and the [[Barclaycard Arena (Hamburg)|Barclaycard Arena]] ([[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]).

The arena opened in July 1995, sponsored by [[NYNEX]] CableComms as '''NYNEX Arena'''. In July 1998, it was renamed the '''Manchester Evening News Arena''', or just the ''MEN Arena'', when it was sponsored by the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' newspaper. In December 2011, the paper ended its 13 year sponsorship, and the arena was renamed Manchester Arena in January 2012.<ref>{{Cite news |title=MEN Media ends naming rights at Manchester Evening News Arena |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/s/1458539_men-media-ends-naming-rights-at-manchester-evening-news-arena |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=13 September 2011 |access-date=27 September 2011}}</ref> In July 2013, the arena was renamed '''Phones 4u Arena''' after the mobile phone company [[Phones 4u]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Ferguson |first=James |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/business-news/manchester-arena-signs-deal-phones-5385660 |title=Manchester Arena signs deal with Phones 4u |work=Manchester Evening News |date=31 July 2013 |access-date=2 August 2013}}</ref> but this deal ended in January 2015 after Phones 4u went out of business, renaming the arena back to Manchester Arena.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/manchester-arena-mark-20-year-anniversary-8417976 |title=Manchester Arena to mark 20-year anniversary with name change  |last1=Evans |first1=Denise |date=10 January 2015 |website=[[Manchester Evening News]] |publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] |access-date=12 May 2015}}</ref> In September 2020, the arena was rebranded as the '''AO Arena''' as part of a five year sponsorship deal by the online electricals retailer [[AO World|AO]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Manchester Arena's new name revealed as bold redesign plans take another step forward |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/manchester-arenas-new-name-revealed-18864103 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=2 September 2020 |access-date=2 September 2020}}</ref>

On the opening night, 15,000 spectators watched [[Jayne Torvill]] and [[Christopher Dean]] perform; the crowd was a record for an ice event.<ref name="Inglis101">{{Harvnb|Inglis|2004|p=101}}</ref> Attendance records were set in 1997 when 17,425 people watched Manchester Storm play [[Sheffield Steelers]], a record for an ice hockey match in Europe at that time.

The venue attracts over a million customers each year for concerts and family shows, making it one of the world's busiest indoor arenas, and was named "International Venue Of The Year" in 2002 in the 'Pollstar' awards, and was nominated in the same category in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The arena was named "Busiest Arena Venue In The World", based on ticket sales for concerts in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 ahead of other indoor arenas including the [[Madison Square Garden]] and [[Wembley Arena]]. The arena was the 'World's Busiest Arena' from 2001 until 2007 based on ticket sales for concerts, attracting five and a half million customers. It was voted 'Europe's Favourite Arena' at the TPi Awards in 2008 by the touring companies that bring the shows to the venue.

On the evening of 27 May 1999, a reception was held at the arena to celebrate [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United's]] [[European Cup]] triumph in [[Barcelona]] 24 hours earlier, following the victorious side's parade around Manchester at the end of the season in which they became the first (and to date only) English team to win the treble of the league title, [[FA Cup]] and European Cup in the same season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/354082.stm|title=BBC News - Sport - Manchester plans huge victory party|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

In 2008, the arena was the world's third busiest arena behind London's [[The O2 Arena]] and New York's Madison Square Garden. In 2009, it was the world's second busiest arena behind London's The O2  and ahead of [[Sportpaleis|Antwerp's Sportpaleis]] and Madison Square Garden. Although second to London's The O2, Manchester's arena had its busiest year with over 1,500,000 people attending concerts and family shows. The arena hosts over 250 events annually including comedy, live music and tours, sporting events, and occasionally musicals.<ref>{{cite web |title=From unwanted empty shell to the world's busiest venue |work=[[Manchester Evening News]] |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article3134279.ece |author=Will Pavia |date=5 January 2008}} Retrieved on 31 August 2008.</ref>
