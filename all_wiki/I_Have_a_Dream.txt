"'''I Have a Dream'''" is a public speech that was delivered by American [[civil rights]] activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] during the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] on August 28, 1963, in which he called for civil and economic rights and an end to [[racism in the United States]]. Delivered to over 250,000 civil rights supporters from the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C., the speech was a defining moment of the [[civil rights movement]] and among the most iconic speeches in [[History of the United States|American history]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hansen|first= D, D.|date=2003|title=The Dream: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Speech that Inspired a Nation|location=New York, NY|publisher=Harper Collins|page=177|OCLC=473993560}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/I-Have-A-Dream|title=I Have a Dream|last=Tikkanen|first=Amy|date=August 29, 2017|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=May 7, 2019}}</ref>

==Background==
[[File:IhaveadreamMarines.jpg|thumb|View from the [[Lincoln Memorial]] toward the [[Washington Monument]] on August 28, 1963]]
The [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] was partly intended to demonstrate mass support for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|civil rights legislation]] proposed by [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] in June. Martin Luther King and other leaders therefore agreed to keep their speeches calm, also, to avoid provoking the [[civil disobedience]] which had become the hallmark of the Civil Rights Movement. King originally designed his speech as a homage to [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Gettysburg Address]], timed to correspond with the centennial of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name=Mills>Nicolaus Mills, "What Really Happened at the March on Washington?", ''Dissent'', Summer 1988; reprinted in ''Civil Rights Since 1787: A Reader on the Black Struggle'', ed. Jonathan Birnbaum and Clarence Taylor, New York: New York University Press, 2000.</ref>

===Speech title and the writing process===
King had been preaching about dreams since 1960, when he gave a speech to the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) called "The Negro and the American Dream". This speech discusses the gap between the American dream and reality, saying that overt [[white supremacy|white supremacists]] have violated the dream, and that "our federal government has also scarred the dream through its apathy and hypocrisy, its betrayal of the cause of justice". King suggests that "It may well be that the Negro is God's instrument to save the soul of America."<ref name=KingInstitute/><ref>Martin Luther King Jr., "[http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol5/25Sept1960_TheNegroandtheAmericanDream,ExcerptfromAddressatt.pdf The Negro and the American Dream]", speech delivered to the NAACP in Charlotte, NC, September 25, 1960.</ref> In 1961, he spoke of the Civil Rights Movement and student activists' "dream" of equality—"the American Dream ... a dream as yet unfulfilled"—in several national speeches and statements, and took "the dream" as the centerpiece for these speeches.<ref>{{cite book | title=The American Dream: A Short History of an Idea that Shaped a Nation | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | last=Cullen | first=Jim | year=2003 | page=126 |isbn=0195158210}}</ref>

On November 27, 1962, King gave a speech at Booker T. Washington High School in [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina]]. That speech was longer than the version which he would eventually deliver from the Lincoln Memorial. And while parts of the text had been moved around, large portions were identical, including the "I have a dream" refrain.<ref name=Stringer>{{cite web|last1=Stringer|first1=Sam|last2=Brumfield|first2=Ben|title=New recording: King's first 'I have a dream' speech found at high school|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/12/us/north-carolina-mlk-jr-i-have-a-dream-recording/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Crook|first1=Samantha|last2=Bryant|first2=Christian|title=How Langston Hughes Led To A 'Dream' MLK Discovery|url=http://www.wkbw.com/newsy/how-langston-hughes-led-to-a-dream-mlk-discovery|website=[[WKBW-TV]]|publisher=The E.W.

King had also delivered a "dream" speech in Detroit, in June 1963, when he marched on [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward Avenue]] with labor leader [[Walter Reuther]], and the Reverend [[C. L. Franklin]], and had rehearsed other parts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Interview With Martin Luther King III |publisher=CNN |date=August 22, 2003 |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0308/22/se.18.html |accessdate=January 15, 2007}}</ref>  Reuther had given King an office at Solidarity House, the [[United Auto Workers]] headquarters in Detroit, where King worked on his "I Have a Dream" speech in anticipation of the March on Washington.<ref>{{Cite web|title=On the Picket Lines of the General Motors Strike|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/on-the-picket-lines-of-the-general-motors-strike|last=Kaufman|first=Dan|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=May 12, 2020}}</ref> Mahalia Jackson, who sang "[[How I Got Over]]",<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130827-a-song-that-made-america-believe |title=How Mahalia Jackson defined the 'I Have a Dream' speech |last=Kot |first=Greg |date=October 21, 2014 |publisher=BBC |access-date=August 28, 2018 }}</ref> just before the speech in Washington, knew about King's Detroit speech.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/08/28/216141088/for-kings-adviser-fulfilling-the-dream-cannot-wait |title=For King's Adviser, Fulfilling The Dream 'Cannot Wait' |last=Norris |first=Michele |date=August 28, 2013 |publisher=NPR |access-date=August 29, 2018 }}</ref> 

The March on Washington Speech, known as "I Have a Dream Speech", has been shown to have had several versions, written at several different times.{{sfn|Hansen|2003|p=70|ps=. The original name of the speech was "Cashing a Cancelled Check", but the aspired ad lib of the dream from preacher's anointing brought forth a new entitlement, "I Have A Dream".}} It has no single version draft, but is an amalgamation of several drafts, and was originally called "Normalcy, Never Again". Little of this, and another "Normalcy Speech", ended up in the final draft. A draft of "Normalcy, Never Again" is housed in the Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. Collection of the [[Robert W. Woodruff Library, Atlanta University Center]] and Morehouse College.<ref>Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. Collection, 2009 "[http://mcmlk.auctr.edu/notable-items.asp Notable Items]" Retrieved December 4, 2013</ref> The focus on "I have a dream" comes through the speech's delivery. Toward the end of its delivery, noted African American [[gospel music|gospel]] singer [[Mahalia Jackson]] shouted to King from the crowd, "Tell them about the dream, Martin."{{sfn|Hansen|2003|p=58}} King departed from his prepared remarks and started "preaching" improvisationally, punctuating his points with "I have a dream."

The speech was drafted with the assistance of [[Stanley Levison]] and [[Clarence Benjamin Jones]]<ref name=stanford>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/jones_clarence.html|title=Jones, Clarence Benjamin (1931– )|publisher=Martin Luther King Jr. and the Global Freedom Struggle (Stanford University)|access-date=February 28, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606124248/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/jones_clarence.html|archive-date=June 6, 2008|df=}}</ref> in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], New York City. Jones has said that "the logistical preparations for the march were so burdensome that the speech was not a priority for us" and that, "on the evening of Tuesday, Aug. 27, [12 hours before the march] Martin still didn't know what he was going to say".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/14/AR2011011406266.html|title=On Martin Luther King Day, remembering the first draft of 'I Have a Dream'|work=The Washington Post|date=January 16, 2011|accessdate=February 28, 2011|first=Clarence B.|last=Jones}}</ref>

Leading up to the speech's rendition at the Great March on Washington, King had delivered its "I have a dream" refrains in his speech before 25,000 people in Detroit's [[Cobo Hall]] immediately after the 125,000-strong [[Great Walk to Freedom in Detroit]], June 23, 1963.<ref>{{citation|title = Detroit's Walk To Freedom|url = http://www.absolutemichigan.com/dig/michigan/detroits-walk-to-freedom/|publisher = [[Michigan History Magazine]]|date = May 1, 2007|last = Boyle|first = Kevin}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title = Martin Luther King Jr. and the Detroit Freedom Walk|url = http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-54463_19313_20652_19271_19357-205425--,00.html|publisher=Michigan Department of Natural Resources – Michigan Library and Historical – Center Michigan Historical Center|first = Bob|last = Garrett|accessdate = February 15, 2012}}</ref> After the Washington, D.C.

==Speech==
Widely hailed as a masterpiece of [[rhetoric]], King's speech invokes pivotal documents in American history, including the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], and the [[United States Constitution]]. Early in his speech, King [[Allusion|alludes]] to [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Gettysburg Address]] by saying "Five score years ago ..." In reference to the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] articulated in the Emancipation Proclamation, King says: "It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity." [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|Anaphora]] (i.e., the repetition of a phrase at the beginning of sentences) is employed throughout the speech. Early in his speech, King urges his audience to seize the moment; "Now is the time" is repeated three times in the sixth paragraph. The most widely cited example of anaphora is found in the often quoted phrase "I have a dream", which is repeated eight times as King paints a picture of an integrated and unified America for his audience. Other occasions include "One hundred years later", "We can never be satisfied", "With this faith", "Let freedom ring", and "free at last". King was the sixteenth out of eighteen people to speak that day, according to the official program.<ref>{{cite web|work=Archives.gov|title=Document for August 28th: Official Program for the March on Washington|url=https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/index.html?dod-date=828}}</ref>

According to [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[John Lewis]], who also spoke that day as the president of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], "Dr. King had the power, the ability, and the capacity to transform those steps on the Lincoln Memorial into a monumental area that will forever be recognized. By speaking the way he did, he educated, he inspired, he informed not just the people there, but people throughout America and unborn generations."<ref>{{cite news |title=A "Dream" Remembered |publisher=NewsHour |date=August 28, 2003 |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/race_relations/july-dec03/march_08-28.html |accessdate=July 19, 2006}}</ref>

The ideas in the speech reflect King's social experiences of ethnocentric abuse, the mistreatment and exploitation of blacks.<ref>Exploring Religion and Ethics: Religion and Ethics for Senior Secondary Students, p 192, Trevor Jordan – 2012</ref> The speech draws upon appeals to America's myths as a nation founded to provide freedom and justice to all people, and then reinforces and transcends those secular mythologies by placing them within a spiritual context by arguing that racial justice is also in accord with God's will. Thus, the rhetoric of the speech provides redemption to America for its racial sins.<ref>See David A. Bobbitt, ''The Rhetoric of Redemption: Kenneth Burke's Redemption Drama and Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" Speech'' (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2004)</ref> King describes the promises made by America as a "[[promissory note]]" on which America has defaulted. He says that "America has given the Negro people a bad check", but that "we've come to cash this check" by marching in Washington, D.C.

===Similarities and allusions===
{{Further|Martin Luther King Jr. authorship issues}}
King's speech used words and ideas from his own speeches and other texts. For years, he had spoken about dreams, quoted from [[Samuel Francis Smith]]'s popular patriotic hymn "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee|America]]" ("My Country, 'Tis of Thee"), and referred extensively to the Bible. The idea of [[constitutional rights]] as an "unfulfilled promise" was suggested by [[Clarence Benjamin Jones|Clarence Jones]].<ref name=KingInstitute/>

The final passage from King's speech closely resembles [[Archibald Carey Jr.]]'s address to the [[1952 Republican National Convention]]: both speeches end with a recitation of the first verse of "America", and the speeches share the name of one of several mountains from which both exhort "let freedom ring".<ref name=KingInstitute>{{cite web |url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/i-have-dream|title=I Have a Dream |publisher=The Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute |accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbez.org/news/culture/long-lost-civil-rights-speech-helped-inspire-king's-dream-108546/|title=Long lost civil rights speech helped inspire King's dream|first=Derek|last=John|publisher=WBEZ|date=August 28, 2013|accessdate=August 28, 2017|archivedate=January 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101071457/http://www.wbez.org/news/culture/long-lost-civil-rights-speech-helped-inspire-king%E2%80%99s-dream-108546/}}</ref>

King also is said to have used portions of [[Prathia Hall]]'s speech at the site of a burned-down African American church in [[Terrell County, Georgia]], in September 1962, in which she used the repeated phrase "I have a dream".<ref>Holsaert, Faith et al. ''Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC''. University of Illinois Press, 2010, p. 180.</ref> The church burned down after it was used for voter registration meetings.<ref>[http://crdl.usg.edu/export/html/ugabma/walb/crdl_ugabma_walb_walb00067.html?Welcome Civil Rights Digital Library]: Film (2:30)</ref>

==Rhetoric==
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|King at the Civil Rights March in Washington, D.C]]
The "I Have a Dream" speech can be dissected by using three [[rhetoric]]al lenses: voice merging, prophetic voice, and dynamic spectacle.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vail|first=Mark|title=The 'Integrative' Rhetoric of Martin Luther King Jr.'S 'I Have a Dream' Speech|journal=Rhetoric and Public Affairs|year=2006|volume=9|page=52|jstor=41940035}}</ref> Voice merging is the combining of one's own voice with religious predecessors. Prophetic voice is using rhetoric to speak for a population. A dynamic spectacle has origins from the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] definition as "a weak hybrid form of drama, a theatrical concoction that relied upon external factors (shock, sensation, and passionate release) such as televised rituals of conflict and social control."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Thomas B.|title=Media Rhetoric as Social Drama: The Winter Olympics of 1984|journal=Critical Studies in Mass Communication|year=1989|volume=6|issue=2|pages=159–160|doi=10.1080/15295038909366742}}<!--|accessdate=October 23, 2013--></ref>

The rhetoric of King's speech can be compared to the rhetoric of [[Old Testament]] prophets. During King's speech, he speaks with urgency and crisis giving him a prophetic voice. The prophetic voice must "restore a sense of duty and virtue amidst the decay of venality."<ref>{{cite book|last=Darsey|first=James|title=The Prophetic Tradition and Radical Rhetoric in America|url=https://archive.org/details/prophetictraditi00dars_0|url-access=registration|year=1997|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/prophetictraditi00dars_0/page/10 10], 19, 47}}</ref> An evident example is when King declares that, "now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children."

Voice merging is a common technique used amongst African American preachers. It combines the voices of previous preachers and excerpts from scriptures along with their own unique thoughts to create a unique voice. King uses voice merging in his [[peroration]] when he references the [[Secuarl hymn (popular)|secular hymn]] "America."

Why King's speech was powerful is debated, but essentially, it came at a point of many factors combining at a key cultural turning point. Executive speechwriter Anthony Trendl writes, "The right man delivered the right words to the right people in the right place at the right time."<ref>{{cite web |first=Anthony |last=Trendl |url=https://americanspeechwriter.com/i-have-a-dream-martin-luther-king-jr/ |title=I Have a Dream Analysis}}</ref>

"Given the context of drama and tension in which it was situated", King's speech can be classified as a dynamic spectacle.{{sfn|Vail|2006|p=55}} A dynamic spectacle is dependent on the situation in which it is used. It can be considered a dynamic spectacle because it happened at the correct time and place: during the Civil Rights Movement and the March on Washington.

==Responses==
The speech was lauded in the days after the event, and was widely considered the high point of the March by contemporary observers.<ref>"The News of the Week in Review: March on Washington—Symbol of intensified drive for Negro rights," ''The New York Times'' (September 1, 1963). ''The high point and climax of the day, it was generally agreed, was the eloquent and moving speech late in the afternoon by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., ....''</ref> [[James Reston]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', said that "Dr. King touched all the themes of the day, only better than anybody else. He was full of the symbolism of Lincoln and Gandhi, and the cadences of the Bible. He was both militant and sad, and he sent the crowd away feeling that the long journey had been worthwhile."<ref name=KingInstitute/> Reston also noted that the event "was better covered by television and the press than any event here since President Kennedy's inauguration", and opined that "it will be a long time before [Washington] forgets the melodious and melancholy voice of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. crying out his dreams to the multitude."<ref>James Reston, {{"'}}I Have a Dream ... ': Peroration by Dr. King sums up a day the capital will remember", ''The New York Times'' (August 29, 1963).</ref> 

An article in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' by [[Mary McGrory]] reported that King's speech "caught the mood" and "moved the crowd" of the day "as no other" speaker in the event.<ref>Mary McGrory, "Polite, Happy, Helpful: The Real Hero Was the Crowd", ''Boston Globe'' (August 29, 1963).</ref> [[Marquis Childs]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that King's speech "rose above mere oratory".<ref>Marquis Childs, "Triumphal March Silences Scoffers", ''The Washington Post'' (August 30, 1963).</ref> An article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' commented that the "matchless eloquence" displayed by King—"a supreme orator" of "a type so rare as almost to be forgotten in our age"—put to shame the advocates of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] by inspiring the "conscience of America" with the justice of the civil-rights cause.<ref>Max Freedman, "The Big March in Washington Described as 'Epic of Democracy{{'"}}, ''Los Angeles Times'' (September 9, 1963).</ref>

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), which viewed King and his allies for racial justice as subversive, also noticed the speech. This provoked the organization to expand their [[COINTELPRO]] operation against the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), and to target King specifically as a major enemy of the United States.<ref>Tim Weiner, ''Enemies: A history of the FBI'', New York: Random House, 2012, p. 235</ref> Two days after King delivered "I Have a Dream", Agent [[William C. Sullivan]], the head of COINTELPRO, wrote a memo about King's growing influence:

<blockquote>In the light of King's powerful demagogic speech yesterday he stands head and shoulders above all other Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of Negroes. We must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this Nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro and national security.<ref>Memo hosted by American Radio Works (American Public Media), "[http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/king/d4.html The FBI's War on King]".</ref></blockquote>

The speech was a success for the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] and for the liberal civil rights coalition that had planned it. It was considered a "triumph of managed protest", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Kennedy had watched King's speech on television and been very impressed. Afterwards, March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with President Kennedy. Kennedy felt the March bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.<ref>Reeves, Richard, ''President Kennedy: Profile of Power'',1993, pp. 580–584</ref>

Meanwhile, some of the more radical Black leaders who were present condemned the speech (along with the rest of the march){{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} as too compromising. [[Malcolm X]] later wrote in [[The Autobiography of Malcolm X|his autobiography]]: "Who ever heard of angry revolutionaries swinging their bare feet together with their oppressor in lily pad pools, with gospels and guitars and 'I have a dream' speeches?"<ref name=Mills/>

The March on Washington put pressure on the Kennedy administration to advance [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|its civil rights legislation]] in Congress.<ref name="test">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2009/1/2009_1_26.shtml Clayborne Carson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102160702/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2009/1/2009_1_26.shtml |date=January 2, 2010 }} "King, Obama, and the Great American Dialogue", ''American Heritage'', Spring 2009.</ref> The diaries of [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], published posthumously in 2007, suggest that President Kennedy was concerned that if the march failed to attract large numbers of demonstrators, it might undermine his civil rights efforts.

In the wake of the speech and march, King was named [[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] by [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] for 1963, and in 1964, he was the youngest man ever awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Martin Luther King |year=1964 |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1964/king-bio.html |accessdate=April 20, 2007}}</ref><!---Malala Yousafzai in 2014 was far younger--> The full speech did not appear in writing until August 1983, some 15 years after King's death, when a transcript was published in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref name=Alvarez/>

In 1990, the Australian [[alternative comedy]] rock band [[Doug Anthony All Stars]] released an album called ''[[DAAS Icon|Icon]]''. One song from ''Icon'', "Shang-a-lang", sampled the end of the speech.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

In 2002, the [[Library of Congress]] honored the speech by adding it to the [[List of recordings preserved in the United States National Recording Registry|United States National Recording Registry]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The National Recording Registry 2002 |publisher=Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2002reg.html}}</ref> In 2003, the [[National Park Service]] dedicated an inscribed marble pedestal to commemorate the location of King's speech at the Lincoln Memorial.<ref>{{cite web |title=We Shall Overcome, Historic Places of the Civil Rights Movement: Lincoln Memorial |publisher=U.S. National Park Service |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/civilrights/dc1.htm |accessdate=January 15, 2007}}</ref>

Near the Potomac Basin in Washington D.C., the [[Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial]] was dedicated in 2011.

On August 28, 2013, thousands gathered on the mall in Washington D.C. where King made his historic speech to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the occasion. In attendance were former U.S. Presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Jimmy Carter]], and incumbent President [[Barack Obama]], who addressed the crowd and spoke on the significance of the event. Many of King's family were in attendance.<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller |first=Zeke J |url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/08/28/in-commemorative-mlk-speech-president-obama-recalls-his-own-2008-dream |title=In Commemorative MLK Speech, President Obama Recalls His Own 2008 Dream |work=Time |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref>

On October 11, 2015, ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' published an exclusive report about [[Stone Mountain]] officials considering installation of a new "Freedom Bell" honoring King and citing the speech's reference to the mountain "Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/10/11/a-monument-to-mlk-will-crown-stone-mountain/ |title=A monument to MLK will crown Stone Mountain |first=Jim |last=Galloway |date=October 12, 2015 |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate=April 23, 2016 }}</ref> Design details and a timeline for its installation remain to be determined.

On April 20, 2016, Treasury Secretary [[Jacob Lew]] announced that the [[United States five-dollar bill|U.S. $5 bill]], which has featured the Lincoln Memorial on its back, would undergo a redesign prior to 2020.  Lew said that a portrait of Lincoln would remain on the front of the bill, but the back would be redesigned to depict various historical events that have occurred at the memorial, including an image from King's speech.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/20/report-lew-considered-anthony-10-bill/83274530/ |title=Anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman to replace Jackson on $20 bill |first=Gregory |last=Korte |date=April 21, 2016 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=April 23, 2016 }}</ref>

[[Ava DuVernay]] was commissioned by the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] to create a film which debuted at the museum's opening on September 24, 2016.

==Copyright dispute==
Because King's speech was broadcast to a large radio and television audience, there was controversy about its copyright status. If the performance of the speech constituted "general publication", it would have entered the [[public domain]] due to King's failure to register the speech with the [[Register of Copyrights]]. However, if the performance only constituted "limited publication", King retained [[common law copyright]]. This led to a lawsuit, ''[[Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. v. CBS, Inc.]]'', which established that the King estate does hold copyright over the speech and had [[Standing (law)|standing to sue]]; the parties then settled. Unlicensed use of the speech or a part of it can still be lawful in some circumstances, especially in jurisdictions under doctrines such as [[fair use]] or [[fair dealing]]. Under the applicable copyright laws, the speech will remain under [[copyright in the United States]] until 70 years after King's death, through 2038.<ref>{{cite news|last=Strauss |first=Valerie |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/08/27/i-have-a-dream-speech-still-private-property/ |title='I Have a Dream' speech still private property |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/08/mlk-intellectual-property-problems/|title=I Have a Copyright: The Problem With MLK’s Speech|last=Williams|first=Lauren|date=August 23, 2013|website=Mother Jones|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/08/copyright-battle-behind-i-have-dream/311980/|title=The Copyright Battle Behind 'I Have a Dream'|last=Volz|first=Dustin|date=August 20, 2013|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=January 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/15/i-have-a-dream-speech-owned-by-king-family.html|title=‘I Have a Dream’ speech owned by Martin Luther King’s family {{!}} The Star|last=Strauss|first=Valerie|date=January 15, 2017|website=thestar.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 21, 2020}}</ref>
