==Career==
===Early work===
In his earliest show business work, Philbin was a page at ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in 1955.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moore |first1=Frazier |title=Regis Philbin is moving on _ but not retiring |url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-regis-philbin-is-moving-on-_-but-not-retiring-2011nov03-story.html |website=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> Later he wrote for Los Angeles-based talk show host [[Tom Duggan]] and nervously filled in one night when the hard-drinking Duggan didn't show up.<ref>{{cite news|last=Grace|first=Roger M.|title=Tom Duggan Enlivens KCOP|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/reminiscing080802.htm|access-date=June 4, 2011|newspaper=Metropolitan News-Enterprise|date=August 8, 2002}}</ref> He also was an announcer on ''The Tonight Show'' in 1962.<ref name="imdb.com" /> In 1957, Regis left his job as assistant news editor to [[Baxter Ward]] at [[KCOP]], Los Angeles, to make his fortune in New York City. His replacement at KCOP was George Van Valkenburg.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

His first talk show was ''The Regis Philbin Show''<ref name="cityfile" /> in 1961 on KOGO-TV (now [[KGTV]]) in [[San Diego]].<ref name="Berman">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcberman1/2020/07/25/legendary-regis-philbin-dies-at-88/#4fa02e953f69|title=Legendary Regis Philbin Dies At 88|first=Marc|last=Berman|magazine=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes Media, LLC and [[Forbes family (publishers)|Forbes family]]|location=United States|access-date=July 31, 2020}}</ref> For financial reasons, he had no writing staff, so he began each show with what became his hallmark, the "host chat" segment (influenced by [[Jack Paar]]), where he engaged his audience (and later his co-host) in discussions about his life and the day's events.<ref name="Berman"/> In 1964, [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] picked up Philbin's talk show for national syndication in the late night time slot (replacing [[Steve Allen]]).<ref name="Berman"/> ''That Regis Philbin Show'' failed to attract many stations and Westinghouse replaced Philbin with [[Merv Griffin]] in 1965.

===Talk shows===
{{Main|Live with Kelly and Ryan#History}}
In 1964, Philbin hosted ''That Regis Philbin Show'', a nationally syndicated show for [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] replacing ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' after [[Steve Allen]] refused to renew his contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/11579|title=mental_floss Blog » The First Time News Was Fit To Print, XXV<!-- Bot generated title -->|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111115147/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/11579|archive-date=January 11, 2010}}</ref> The audience did not accept Philbin as a replacement for Allen's zany antics and the appearance lasted only a little over four months because of dismal ratings, especially compared to [[Johnny Carson]] in the same time slot. Nevertheless, Philbin has cited Carson as an influence.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gilbert |first1=Matthew |title=Pioneers of Television Review |url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2008/01/02/a_superficial_look_at_history_of_tvs_golden_era/?page=full |publisher=The Boston Globe |access-date=July 26, 2020 |date=January 2, 2008}}</ref>

Philbin gained his first network TV exposure in 1967 as [[Joey Bishop]]'s [[sidekick]] on ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''<ref name="Berman"/> on television (1967–1969). In a [[Johnny Carson]]-[[Ed McMahon]] vein, Bishop would playfully tease Philbin and he would take the barbs in stride. But his feelings were hurt when he learned from the network [[grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]] that [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] executives were dissatisfied with his work and his thick accent, so during the opening of one 1968 program, he launched an unplanned diatribe about "not being wanted and letting down" the program and abruptly quit on air. A few nights later, assured by Bishop that all was well and the barbs were not personal, Philbin returned. As revealed in his 1995 book, ''I'm Only One Man!'', this was actually a publicity stunt planned by Bishop and Philbin beforehand.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fretts |first1=Bruce |title=TV Show Review: 'I'm Only One Man' |url=https://ew.com/article/1995/09/15/tv-show-review-im-only-one-man/ |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=July 26, 2020 |date=September 15, 1995}}</ref> He reiterates this assertion in his 2011 memoir, ''How I Got This Way'', explaining that it was intended to draw in some of [[Johnny Carson]]'s viewers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Regis Philbin Explains How He 'Got This Way' |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/15/142309202/regis-philbin-explains-how-he-got-this-way |publisher=NPR |access-date=July 26, 2020 |date=November 14, 2011}}</ref> When ''The Joey Bishop Show'' was canceled, Bishop returned the favor and walked off the show on the air unannounced, leaving Philbin to carry the night on his own.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ellerbee |first1=Bobby |title=April 17, 1967...

During the early 1970s, Philbin co-hosted ''Tempo'' on Los Angeles station KHJ-TV (now [[KCAL-TV]]).  He also commuted on weekends to [[St. Louis]], where he filmed ''Regis Philbin's Saturday Night in St. Louis''<ref name=Yahoo/> on KMOX-TV (now [[KMOV]]).

From 1975 to 1981, he co-hosted ''A.M. Los Angeles'', a local morning talk show on [[KABC-TV]],<ref name="Yahoo">[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800263376/bio Regis Philbin Biography] Yahoo! Movies</ref> where Philbin was already working reviewing movies for newscasts on the station.  He co-hosted first with [[Sarah Purcell]] (1975 to 1978), then with [[Cyndy Garvey]] (1978 to 1981).<ref name="Yahoo"/> Philbin's presence brought the show from the bottom of the local ratings to No. 1.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/regis-philbin/person/3643/summary.html Regis Philbin] on TV.com<!-- Bot generated title --></ref>

From November 30, 1981 to April 9, 1982, Philbin and [[Mary Hart]] co-hosted "The Regis Philbin Show," a national morning [[variety series]] for [[NBC]]. Philbin was hoping to transfer his success from KABC to a [[television network| national network show]], but the show was not successful and lasted only 18 weeks.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/57/Regis-Philbin.html Regis Philbin Biography (1933–)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>  During 1982 to 1988, Philbin hosted the shows ''Health Styles'' <ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2783062/ Regis Philbin's Healthstyles<!-- Bot generated title -->] from IMDb</ref> and ''Lifestyles with Regis Philbin'' <ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1025006/ Regis Philbin's Lifestyles (TV Series 1984–1987)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from IMDb</ref> on the Cable Health Network and its successor, the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] television network.

After Garvey left Los Angeles in 1982 and moved to New York City,<ref name="Yahoo" /> Philbin rejoined her on ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan|The Morning Show]]'',<ref name="Yahoo" /> on [[WABC-TV]] starting on April 4,1983.<ref name="Yahoo" /> At the time, the 9&nbsp;am time slot for WABC suffered from low [[Nielsen ratings]] because of competition from [[WNBC-TV]]'s ''[[The Phil Donahue Show|Donahue]]'' and [[WCBS-TV]]'s game show block featuring ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'' and ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough|Tic Tac Dough]]''. After Garvey left again and Ann Abernathy briefly shared co-hosting duties, Philbin was paired with [[Kathie Lee Gifford|Kathie Lee Johnson]] (later Gifford), in June 1985, and [[Audience measurement|ratings]] improved significantly. The show became nationally [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] on September 5, 1988 as ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan|Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee]]''<ref name="Yahoo" /> and the success continued. The program replaced ''A.M. Los Angeles'' upon its [[cancellation (television)|cancellation]] in 1991 and was eventually picked up by all of the ABC owned-and-operated stations except for [[WLS-TV|WLS]] in Chicago, which aired ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in that time slot and had done so since the show's debut as ''A.M. Chicago''.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

===Game shows===
Philbin was also a game show host. He hosted ''[[The Neighbors (game show)|The Neighbors]]'', a short-lived game show on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from late 1975 to early 1976. The show had two female contestants guessing which of her three women neighbors said gossipy things about her.<ref name="imdb.com" /> In 1976, he was a "field reporter" for ABC's ''[[It's a Knockout#United States|Almost Anything Goes]]'', an American adaptation of the British game show, ''[[It's a Knockout]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Berman |first1=Marc |title=Legendary Regis Philbin Dies At 88 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcberman1/2020/07/25/legendary-regis-philbin-dies-at-88/#842a5213f696 |access-date=July 27, 2020 |work=Forbes |date=July 25, 2020}}</ref>

Philbin was the original host of the U.S. version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'', an ABC game show that [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?|had its roots in Britain]]. ''Millionaire'' was a big ratings success in its 1999 debut, when it was intended as an occasional special series. ABC aired ''Millionaire'' as a regular series with frequent episodes, but its viewership slowly declined. After ''Millionaire'' was canceled, it was retooled in 2002 as a syndicated series hosted by [[Meredith Vieira]]. ABC brought back ''Millionaire'' in 2004 with Philbin, retitled ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)#Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire|Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire]]'', a related series that was aired on a more limited basis. Philbin had appeared in 11 episodes of a special edition of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'', which started on August 9, 2009, 10th anniversary of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/details-on-abcs-millionaire-10th-anniversary/|title=Details on ABC's "Millionaire" 10th Anniversary – BuzzerBlog<!-- Bot generated title -->|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731115133/http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/details-on-abcs-millionaire-10th-anniversary/|archive-date=July 31, 2009}}</ref> He also was a celebrity contestant in this version.

Philbin's ''Millionaire'' hosting duties won him a [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host]] in 2001.

In November 2005, ABC announced that Philbin would host the network's revival of ''[[This Is Your Life]]''. In August 2006, he reported that his option on the contract for the show had lapsed and he declined to renew it.<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6357475.html?display=Search+Results&text=regis+philbin "ABC Contemplates Life Without Regis"], ''Broadcasting & Cable'', August 30, 2006. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014115650/http://broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6357475.html?display=Search+Results&text=regis+philbin |date=October 14, 2007 }}</ref>

Philbin hosted [[America's Got Talent (season 1)|the first season]] of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', a [[Simon Cowell]]-produced amateur talent search show on [[NBC]], during the summer of 2006.

Philbin played on the Notre Dame tennis team, casting doubt on claims he made in an ad that he had learned to play tennis from Senese. Notre Dame football coaches such as [[Charlie Weis]], [[Tyrone Willingham]], and [[Lou Holtz]] have appeared on ''Live''. Along with being a Yankees fan, Philbin was also "keeping an eye on the [[Florida Marlins]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080612&content_id=2901048&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=You gotta believe, Regis says|website=Major League Baseball}}</ref> On May 5, 2009, he delivered the first pitch at a Marlins game.

In March 1984, Philbin opened a [[Ford]] dealership in [[Gilbert, Arizona]], as a side investment during his career in television.

Philbin was known to have trouble handling new technology, and was frequently confused when operating electronics such as remote controls and DVD players. He did not usually use computers (although he did use one for an episode of ''Live'' in 2008, demonstrating how to find homes online) and did not own a cell phone until September 2008. It is often noted, however, that he did not completely reject technology; he simply had Senese make calls and send emails for him.<ref>Noted in a late-2005 broadcast episode of ''Live'', by Joy Philbin.</ref>

==Popular culture==
===Acting roles===
Philbin was cast as car salesman Handsome Hal on Kelly Ripa's sitcom ''[[Hope & Faith]]''.<ref>{{cite web| last=Susman| first=Gary| title=Regis joins Ripa on ''Hope & Faith''| url=https://ew.com/article/2003/10/01/regis-joins-ripa-hope-faith/| work=Entertainment Weekly| date=October 1, 2003| access-date=July 26, 2020}}</ref> He was chosen as the voice of Mabel, the sister of the Ugly Stepsister (played by [[Larry King]]), in ''[[Shrek the Third]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Monfette|first1=Christopher|last2=Monfette|first2=Stax|title=Shrek the Third DVD Review|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/13/shrek-the-third-dvd-review|publisher=IGN|date=November 13, 2007|access-date=July 26, 2020}}</ref>

===''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''===
During the successful first run of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'', Philbin popularized the [[monochromatic]] look in men's formal wear that emphasizes color rather than pattern in ties and dress shirts. His look was a suit, shirt and tie coordinated in solid, slightly varying shades of the same, usually dark or muted, color.<ref name="CNN-2002" /> A [[Van Heusen (brand)|Van Heusen]] clothing line based on this look, called ''Regis'', was short-lived.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/EXTRA_Shopping_for_Regis/312513 |title=Extra: Shopping for Regis |access-date=February 16, 2007 |last=Keller |first=Julie |date=June 16, 2000 |publisher=Hollywood.com |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130127013248/http://www.hollywood.com/news/EXTRA_Shopping_for_Regis/312513 |archive-date=January 27, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

When Philbin hosted ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'', he used the phrase "''Is that your final answer?''" whenever he had to confirm a contestant's answer. Adopted from the original UK host [[Chris Tarrant]], this became Philbin's [[catch phrase]] during his tenure with the show.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McCann |first1=Paul |last2=Usborne |first2=David |title=Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?

In August 2009, Philbin returned for a two-week stint as host of ''Millionaire''. The eleven shows (Sunday-to-Thursday twice, plus one extra Sunday) started airing on August 9 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] primetime.

Philbin (along with [[Steve Harvey]] and [[John Henson (comedian)|John Henson]]) were named the 2009–10 guest hosts of the daily ''Millionaire''. Philbin's episodes aired November 30 – December 4, 2009, and debuted new rules on the show.

===''2007 Neiman Marcus Christmas Book''===
In October 2007, Philbin was featured in the 100th anniversary issue of the [[Neiman Marcus]] Christmas Book. He was a host of the ''Classical Superstars Fantasy Concert'', which included piano virtuoso [[Lola Astanova]] with Russia's [[Kirov Orchestra]] led by conductor [[Valery Gergiev]]. The super concert for 500 guests was offered for sale at $1.6&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.neimanmarcus.com/store/sitelets/christmasbook/fantasy.jhtml?cid=OCBF8_NMO2795&cmCat=christmas&icid=nmi070209cblaunchparty4|title=Classical Superstars Fantasy Concert|publisher=Neiman Marcus|date=October 2, 2007|access-date=November 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927060047/http://www.neimanmarcus.com/store/sitelets/christmasbook/fantasy.jhtml?cid=OCBF8_NMO2795&cmCat=christmas&icid=nmi070209cblaunchparty4|archive-date=September 27, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>
