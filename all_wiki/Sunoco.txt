'''Sunoco LP''' is an American  [[master limited partnership]] organized in [[Delaware]] and headquartered in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], that is a wholesale distributor of [[motor fuel]]s. It distributes fuel to more than 7,300 Sunoco-branded gas stations, almost all of which are owned and operated by third parties. The partnership is controlled by [[Energy Transfer Partners]].<ref name=10K/>

The partnership was formerly known as '''Sun Company Inc.''' (1886–1920 and 1976–1998) and '''Sun Oil Co.''' (1920–1976). It was formerly engaged in [[oil refinery]], the [[chemical industry]], and retail sales, but divested these businesses.

==History==
===1800s to 1950s: founding and growth===
[[File:1920 Sunoco motor oil newspaper ad.png|thumbnail|left|Newspaper ad for Sunoco motor oil, then known as Sun Oil ''[[Tulsa Daily World]]'' (November 1, 1922)]]
The partnership began as The Peoples Natural Gas Company in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. In 1886, its partners – [[Joseph Newton Pew]], Philip Pisano, and Edward O. Emerson – decided to expand their gas business with a stake in the new oil discoveries in [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. Four years later, the growing enterprise became the Sun Oil Company of Ohio. Sun Oil diversified quickly, active in production and distribution of oil as well as processing and marketing refined products. By 1901, the company was incorporated in [[New Jersey]] as Sun Company.

In 1902, the Sun Oil Refining Company was chartered in Texas, as it turned its interest to the new [[Spindletop]] field in [[Texas]].  Joseph Pew's nephew, J. Edgar Pew, was able to buy the storage and transportation assets of Lone Star and Crescent Oil Company at a [[receivership]] [[auction]].  Spindletop oil was then shipped to the company's [[Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania]], refinery.<ref name=jl>{{cite book |last1=Linsley |first1=Judith |last2=Rienstrad |first2=Ellen |last3=Stiles |first3=Jo |title=Giant Under the Hill, A History of the Spindletop Oil Discovery at Beaumont, Texas in 1901 |date=2002 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |location=Austin |isbn=9780876112366 |pages=196-199}}</ref><ref name=oo>{{cite book |last1=Olien |first1=Diana |last2=Olien |first2=Roger |title=Oil in Texas, The Gusher Age, 1895-1945 |date=2002 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |isbn=0292760566 |pages=48}}</ref>

Pew's sons, [[J. Howard Pew]] and [[Joseph N. Pew Jr.]] would take over the company after their father's death.

With a growing portfolio of oil fields and refineries, Sun opened its first service station in [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania]] in 1920. In 1922, it changed its name back to Sun Oil Company and, in 1925, it became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]] on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. Sunoco ranked 39th among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] production contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p. 620</ref> Sun expanded internationally following the war. Its first Canadian refinery was built in 1953 in [[Sarnia, Ontario]], home to a burgeoning new [[petrochemical industry]]. Sun established a facility at Venezuela's [[Lake Maracaibo]] in 1957, which produced over a billion barrels (160,000,000 m<sup>3</sup>) before the operation was [[nationalized]] in 1975.

====Custom blending====
In 1956, Sunoco introduced "custom blending" pumps, an innovation that allowed customers of Sunoco service stations to choose from several [[octane rating]]s through a single pump.<ref>https://www.poplargrovewingsandwheels.com/index.asp?SEC=E9585369-AE0A-4D82-AEA0-1FFD4C803E81&Type=B_BASIC</ref> Sunoco stations offered as many as eight grades of "Custom Blended" gasolines from its "Dial A Grade" pumps ranging from subregular Sunoco 190 to Sunoco 260, the latter a super-premium grade of 102 octane that was advertised as the "highest octane pump gas" and very popular with operators of [[V8 engine|V8]]-powered [[muscle cars]] of the 1960s.<ref>{{cite news | title=America's six finest gasoline grades custom-blended to fit any car today | url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/68232358/ | work=Shamokin News-Dispatch |location=Shamokin, Penn. | date=July 2, 1958 |url-access=subscription |postscript=. Advertisement.}}</ref>

===1960s to 2000s: acquisitions and branding===
In 1967, Sun established its Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited facility in northern [[Alberta]], Canada, to help unlock the estimated 300 billion barrels (48&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>) of recoverable oil in the [[Athabasca oil sands]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The oilsands at 50: Will they still be producing in 100 years?|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/great-canadian-oil-sands-50th-birthday-1.4309424}}</ref>

In 1968, Sun Oil merged with [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]-based '''Sunray DX Oil Company''', which refined and marketed gasoline under the '''DX''' brand in several midwestern states, and included several refineries.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/398/447/30107/ |title=Sunray Dx Oil Company, and J. H. Douma, R. E. Foss, R. Paul Henry, R. W. Mcdowell, L. G. Rodgers, and C. H. Wright, Appellants, v. Helmerich & Payne, Inc., John C. Priest, Andrew J. Musacchio and James Crum, Appellees, 398 F.2d 447 (10th Cir. 1968) |publisher=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] |date=July 12, 1968}}</ref> Its Tulsa refinery was operated by Sun until its sale in June 2009 to Holly Corporation of Dallas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/FTO/0x0xS950134-09-7659/48039/filing.pdf |title=HOLLY CORP FORM 8-K |publisher=[[Holly Corporation]] |date=April 16, 2009}}</ref> This move expanded Sun's marketing area into the mid-continent region.

Sun Oil continued marketing its petroleum products under both the Sunoco and DX brands through the 1970s and into the 1980s. In the late 1980s, Sun began rebranding DX stations in the Midwest to the Sunoco brand, but by the early 1990s, they pulled out of virtually all areas in the southeastern U.S. and west of the Mississippi, resulting in the closing and rebranding of service stations and jobbers to other brands in those areas, notably [[Sinclair Oil|Sinclair]] in Oklahoma.

With increased diversification, Sun Oil Company was renamed Sun Company in 1976. In 1980, Sun acquired the U.S. oil and gas properties of '''Texas Pacific Oil Company, Inc.''', a subsidiary of The [[Seagram]] Company, Ltd., for US$2.3 billion—the second largest acquisition in U.S. history to that date.

Through the 1980s, Sun developed oil interests in the [[North Sea]] and offshore [[China]] and expanded its holdings in both oil and coal with additional U.S. business acquisitions. In 1983, Sun Oil launched Sunoco ULTRA 94, the market's highest octane unleaded gasoline. Then in 1988, Sun undertook a restructuring to segregate its domestic oil and gas exploration and production business and the focus the company on its refining and marketing business. This led to the acquisition of [[Atlantic Refining and Marketing]] (and, in effect, that company's [[convenience store]] chain, [[A-Plus]]), including its Philadelphia refinery which was later merged with the former [[Gulf Oil]] refinery next door that Sunoco acquired from [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]].

By the 1990s, Sun had departed the international exploration business and was fully dedicated to its branded products and services. In 1994, Sunoco acquired the Philadelphia [[Chevron Oil]] refinery consolidating operations with its own adjacent which it had acquired with Atlantic. Sun sold its remaining interest in Canada's [[Suncor Energy]] in 1995, but markets product from two refineries – one in [[Toledo, Ohio]], and the other [[Sarnia, Ontario]] – in joint ventures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunocochem.com/products/sarniaf.htm |title=Sunoco Chemicals and the Sarnia Refinery |publisher=Sunocochem.com |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref> In 1998, Sun Company, Inc. became Sunoco, Inc. In 2011 the Toledo facility was sold to PBF Energy.

In 1998, Sun acquired the chemical business of Allied Signal, including a [[phenol]] plant. The business was renamed as "Sunoco Chemicals, Inc."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.hydrocarbononline.com/doc/sun-co-to-acquire-alliedsignals-philadelphia-0001 |title=Sun Co. to Acquire AlliedSignal's Philadelphia Phenol Facility |work=Hydrocarbon Online |date=April 2, 1998}}</ref> In 2011, the plant was acquired by [[Honeywell]] for $85 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inq-phillydeals/Sunoco-sells-Philly-plant.html |title=Sunoco sells Philly plant to Honeywell |first=Joseph N. |last=DiStefano |publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]] |date=May 18, 2011}}</ref>

In 2003, [[Speedway LLC]], then a subsidiary of [[Marathon Petroleum]], sold 193 convenience stores to Sunoco.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2003/02/03/daily45.html |title=Sunoco buying 193 stations from Marathon Ashland unit |work=[[American City Business Journals]] |date=February 7, 2003}}</ref> It also acquired many service stations from Coastal Petroleum.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2003/12/ftc-closes-investigation-sunocos-proposed-acquisition-coastal |title=FTC Closes Investigation of Sunoco's Proposed Acquisition of Coastal Eagle Point Oil Company |work=[[Federal Trade Commission]] |date=December 29, 2003}}</ref>

[[File:SunocoDispenserRoadAmerica2010Bucyros200.jpg|thumb|right|Sunoco fuel supply truck at 2010 NASCAR race]]
In 2004, Sunoco replaced the [[ConocoPhillips]]' [[76 (Phillips 66)|76]] brand as the "Official Fuel of [[NASCAR]]."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2004/05/10/focus3.html |title=Sunoco and NASCAR forge winning team |first=Mike |last=Mathis |work=[[American City Business Journals]] |date=May 10, 2004}}</ref>

After ConocoPhillips abandoned the marketing of the [[Mobil]] brand name in the [[Washington, D.C.]], area, Sunoco purchased these rights, converted Maryland and Virginia Mobil stations to the Sunoco brand, bringing the A-Plus convenience store with them – prior to this, these stations had convenience stores under the [[Circle K]] or [[On the Run (convenience store)|On the Run]] brands.

In September 2009, Sunoco sold its retail [[heating oil]] and [[propane]] distribution business to Superior Plus for $82.5 million in cash.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/superior-plus-completes-us86-million-acquisition-of-sunoco-retail-heat-tsx-spb-1269316.htm |title=Superior Plus Completes US$86 Million Acquisition of Sunoco Retail Heat |publisher=[[Marketwired]] |date=September 30, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/superiorplus/update-1-superior-to-buy-sunocos-fuel-distribution-biz-idUSBNG10144020090902 |title=Superior to buy Sunoco's fuel distribution biz |first=Koustav |last=Samanta |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=September 2, 2009}}</ref>

In 2012, Sunoco demolished its Eagle Point refinery complex in [[West Deptford Township, New Jersey]], which had been idle since 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://patch.com/new-jersey/westdeptford/sunoco-demolishing-eagle-point-refinery |title=Sunoco Demolishing Eagle Point Refinery |first=Bryan |last=Littel |publisher=[[Patch Media]] |date=February 16, 2012}}</ref>

In [[Canada]], the Sunoco brand was licensed for the [[Ontario]] retail gas station operations of [[Suncor Energy]] until 2010. Following Suncor's acquisition of [[Petro-Canada]], all Canadian Sunoco outlets were converted to Petro-Canada branding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sunoco.ca/ |title=Sunoco.ca}}</ref>

===Exit from refinery business===
In December 2010, Sunoco sold its refinery in [[Toledo, Ohio]] to [[PBF Energy]] for {{currency|400 million|USD}}. Effective September 6, 2011, Sunoco announced that it would exit the crude oil refining business and seek to sell its [[Philadelphia]] and [[Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania|Marcus Hook]] refineries by mid-2012. The company has said that its cost for exiting the refining business could be as high as {{US$|2.7 billion}}. According to one report, the company had lost some {{currency|800 million|USD}} on refining operations since 2009; an earlier report provided a figure of {{currency|772 million|USD}}.

On December 1, 2011, Sunoco announced it would accelerate closure of the Marcus Hook facility.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20111202_Sunoco_abruptly_shuts_Marcus_Hook_refinery.html  | title=Sunoco abruptly shuts Marcus Hook refinery | first=Andrew | last=Maykuth | work=[[Philadelphia Media Network]] | date=December 2, 2011}}</ref> The Marcus Hook facility, founded in 1902 and covering 781 acres, was dedicated exclusively to the processing of [[Sweet crude oil|light sweet crude oil]]; this processing focus combined with volatility in crude oil prices are considered contributing factors to both this refinery's closure and Sunoco's exit from the refinery business.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/blog/peter-key/2012/01/how-the-oil-refining-industry-is-like.html | title=Venture that saved a Philadelphia refinery launched | first=Peter | last=Key | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=January 20, 2012}}</ref>

===Joint venture, bankruptcy, and future closure===
In September 2012, Sunoco formed a [[joint venture]] with [[The Carlyle Group]], allowing for the continuation of operations at the Philadelphia refinery, and temporarily saving over 800 jobs.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.carlyle.com/media-room/news-release-archive/carlyle-group-and-sunoco-agree-form-philadelphia-refinery-joint | title=The Carlyle Group and Sunoco Agree to Form Philadelphia Refinery Joint Venture | publisher=[[The Carlyle Group]] | date=July 1, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2012/09/19/venture-that-saved-a-philadelphia.html | title=Venture that saved a Philadelphia refinery launched | first=Peter | last=Key | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=September 19, 2012}}</ref> However, on January 22, 2018, the joint venture, named Philadelphia Energy Solutions, filed for [[bankruptcy]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-22/biggest-u-s-east-coast-oil-refiner-seeks-bankruptcy-protection | title=Biggest U.S. East Coast Oil Refinery Files for Bankruptcy | first1=Barbara J. | last1=Powell | first2=Dan | last2=Murtaugh | work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=January 22, 2018}}</ref>  The bankruptcy announcement was followed by a damaging fire on June 21, 2019, which occurred at the 30,000 bpd [[Alkylation unit]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-refinery-operations-pes-pennsylvania/massive-philadelphia-refinery-fire-threatens-facilitys-future-idUSKCN1TM0YB| title=Massive Philadelphia Refinery Fire Threatens Facility's Future| first1=Jarrett | last1=Renshaw| work=[[Reuters]] | date=June 21, 2019}}</ref> The explosion of the Alkylation Unit triggered a massive fireball and caused nearby homes to shake.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/philadelphia-oil-refinery-fire.html| title=Philadelphia Oil Refinery Explosion Shakes City With Huge Fireball| first1=Sarah| last1=Mervosh| work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 21, 2019}}</ref> A few days later, on June 26 the refinery complex announced it would cease operations and shut down.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.inquirer.com/business/philadelphia-refinery-fire-plan-to-close-20190626.html | title=Philadelphia Energy Solutions to close refinery damaged by fire; gas prices spike | first1=Andrew | last1=Maykuth | first2=Claudia | last2=Vargas | work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>
