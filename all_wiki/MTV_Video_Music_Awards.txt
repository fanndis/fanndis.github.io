The '''MTV Video Music Awards''' (commonly abbreviated as the '''VMAs''') are an award show presented by the cable channel [[MTV]] to honor the best in the [[music video]] medium. Originally conceived as an alternative to the [[Grammy Award]]s (in the video category), the annual MTV Video Music Awards ceremony has often been called the "[[Super Bowl]] for youth", an acknowledgment of the VMA ceremony's ability to draw millions of youth from teens to 20-somethings each year.<ref name=nyt1>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/20/business/media-business-advertising-mtv-s-sponsors-hope-video-music-awards-can-draw-crowd.html|title=MTV's sponsors hope the Video Music Awards can draw a crowd, without wardrobe malfunctions. |last1=Elliot |first1=Stuart |date=August 20, 2004 |work =[[The New York Times|NYTimes.com]]  |access-date=19 September 2010}}</ref> By 2001, the VMA had become a coveted award.<ref name=bbc1>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1456093.stm|title=MTV's irresistible rise |date=July 1, 2000 |work=[[BBC News|News.BBC.co.uk]]  |access-date=16 September 2009}}</ref> The statue given to winners is an [[astronaut]] on the moon, one of the earliest representations of MTV, and was colloquially called a "moonman".

The annual VMA ceremony occurs before the end of summer and held either in late August or mid-September, and broadcast live on MTV, along with a "roadblock" simulcast across MTV's [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks|sister networks]] since 2014, which is utilized to maximize the ceremony's ratings. The [[1984 MTV Video Music Awards|first VMA ceremony]] was held in 1984 at [[New York City]]'s [[Radio City Music Hall]]. The ceremonies are normally held in either New York City or [[Los Angeles]]. However, the ceremonies have also been hosted in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The 2019 MTV Video Music Awards took place on August 26, 2019, in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] for the first time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3122461/2019-vmas-announcement/ | title=The 2019 VMAs Will Go Where The Show Has Never Gone Before | work=MTV News | date=April 29, 2018 | access-date=April 29, 2018 | author=Roth, Madeline}}</ref>

'''1988''': At the [[1988 MTV Video Music Awards|1988 Video Music Awards]] [[Michael Jackson]] appeared for the first time. A pre-recorded live performance of [[Bad (album)|''Bad'']] was shown."<ref name=elton/> He was also awarded the [[MTV Video Music Award – Video Vanguard|Video Vanguard Award]],<ref name=mjvanguard>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.ca/vma/2009/article.jhtml?id=10283 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200331020421/https://www.mtv.ca/vma/2009/article.jhtml?id=10283 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 31, 2020 |title=1988 WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE |date=August 7, 2008 |work=[[MTV (Canada)#MTV.ca|MTV.ca]] |publisher=[[CTVglobemedia]] |access-date=27 September 2010 }}</ref> which was later renamed in his honor. 

'''1989''': Controversial comic [[Andrew Dice Clay]]'s appearance at the [[1989 MTV Video Music Awards|1989 Video Music Awards]] to promote his new movie, ''[[The Adventures of Ford Fairlane]]'', earned him a "lifetime ban" from the network when he introduced [[Cher]] with some of his recently notorious [[nursery rhyme]]s that contained vulgar language and references.<ref name=andrewdiceclay>{{cite web |url= http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/08/18/andrew-dice-clay-banned-vmas/|title=The 2010 VMA Countdown: Andrew Dice Clay Earns Himself A Lifetime Ban|author=MTV News |date=August 18, 2010 |work=MTV.com  |access-date=19 September 2010}}</ref> After performing with [[Tom Petty]], [[Guns N' Roses]] guitarist [[Izzy Stradlin]] was assaulted by [[Mötley Crüe]] [[lead singer]] [[Vince Neil]], leading to a verbal battle between Neil and Guns N' Roses lead singer [[Axl Rose]].<ref name=pettyassault>{{cite web |url= http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/history/history89.php|title=Here Today...

[[Jon Bon Jovi]] and [[Richie Sambora]] turned out a stripped-down acoustic performance of the [[Bon Jovi]] hits "[[Wanted Dead or Alive (Bon Jovi song)|Wanted Dead or Alive]] and "[[Livin' on a Prayer]]", and in the process possibly provided the inspirational spark for [[MTV Unplugged]].<ref name=vma1989/><ref name="foo">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/photos/2005-video-music-awards-hot-shots/1505127/1755775/photo.jhtml |title=Bon Jovi unplug at the VMAs, and an MTV tradition is born (1989) &#124; MTV Photo Gallery |publisher=Mtv.com |access-date=2011-08-05}}</ref>

When [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] won the Viewer's Choice Award (sponsored by Pepsi-Cola) for her "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]" video, she thanked [[Pepsi-Cola Company|Pepsi-Cola]] in her acceptance speech "for causing so much controversy". Pepsi-Cola had paid Madonna $5 million to appear in a commercial that would predominantly feature the world premiere of "Like a Prayer"; the commercial, titled "Make a Wish", depicted Madonna drinking Pepsi and watching a home video of her eighth birthday. The tone that the commercial sought to convey sharply contrasted with the music video. When Pepsi executives saw the video, they yanked the advertisement after only two airings, in an attempt to dissociate themselves from Madonna.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/5-14-2004-54134.asp |title=The "Like A Prayer" Controversy |last1=Kulkarni |first1=Dhananjay |work=Buzzle.com |access-date=19 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919045153/http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/5-14-2004-54134.asp |archive-date=19 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> She also gave one of the most memorable performances of her hit "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]", as a preview of what would become her [[Blond Ambition World Tour]].<ref name=vma1989/>

===1990s===

'''1990''': At the [[1990 MTV Video Music Awards]], Madonna gave a memorable performance of her single "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]," which featured Madonna and her backup dancers dressed in an 18th-century French theme, with Madonna bearing great resemblance to [[Marie Antoinette]]. The performance consisted of both a dramatic historical reinterpretation of "Vogue" as well as her dramatically becorseted breasts.<ref name=madonna1990>{{cite web |url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2008/08/25/vma-veteran-five-years-of-madonna-performances/|title=VMA Veteran: Five Years of Madonna Performances |last1=Anitai |first1=Tamar |date=August 25, 2008 |work=MTV.com  |access-date=27 September 2010}}</ref>

'''1991''': During the award show the MTV Video Vanguard Award was renamed to the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award]] from then on, in honor of his contributions to the culture of music videos<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/vma/1991 | title=vmas 1991 | work=MTV | access-date=June 17, 2016}}</ref> by changing them from a mere promotional tool featuring musicians playing instruments and singing, to a "short film" with a storyline.

A conflict between [[Poison (American band)|Poison]]'s [[Bret Michaels]] and [[C.C. DeVille]] culminated in a fistfight at the [[1991 MTV Video Music Awards|Video Music Awards in 1991]]. DeVille was fired and replaced by [[Pennsylvania]]n guitarist [[Richie Kotzen]].<ref name=vma1991/> [[Paul Reubens]] had his first public appearance, during the opening montage, following an arrest for lewd-conduct earlier that year. Taking the stage in costume as [[Pee-wee Herman]], he received a standing ovation, after which he asked the audience, "Heard any good jokes lately?"<ref name=peewee>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1576172/20071210/story.jhtml |title=Pee-Wee's Big Return?

[[Metallica]] was another highlight of the performances with "[[Enter Sandman]]."

[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] & [[New Power Generation|The New Power Generation]] performed their sexually charged song "[[Gett Off]]" on a Caligula-esque set, with Prince dressed in a yellow mesh outfit which infamously exposed his buttocks. His trousers were parodied numerous times throughout the following year, on [[In Living Color]] and even at the following year's VMAs by [[Howard Stern]].

It also marked the final TV appearance of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] with [[Eric Carr]], before Carr's death that November.

'''1992''': In the [[1992 MTV Video Music Awards|1992 show]], MTV requested [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] perform "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]", while the band itself had indicated it preferred to play new songs "[[Rape Me]]" and "[[In Utero (album)|{{not a typo|tourette's}}]]". Network executives continued to push for "Teen Spirit" but finally offered the band a choice to play either "Teen Spirit" or "[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]", which the band appeared to accept. At the performance, Nirvana began to play, and [[Kurt Cobain]] played the first few chords of the song, "Rape Me", much to the horror of MTV execs, before continuing their regular performance of "Lithium". Near the end of the song, frustrated that his amplifier had stopped functioning, bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] decided to toss his bass into the air for dramatic effect. He misjudged the landing, and the bass ended up bouncing off of his forehead, forcing him to stumble off the stage in a daze.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/music/nirvanas-mtv-vmas-1992-bad-night/|title=Head Wounds And Hurt Feelings: The Story Of Nirvana’s Horrific Night At The 1992 VMAs}}</ref>

Backstage, before the show, [[Guns N' Roses]] vocalist [[Axl Rose]] challenged Cobain to a fight after he, his wife and [[Hole (band)|Hole]] frontwoman, [[Courtney Love]], and Nirvana bandmates [[Krist Novoselic]] and [[Dave Grohl]], egged him on. At the end of Nirvana's performance, while Cobain was trashing the band's equipment, [[Dave Grohl]] ran to the microphone and shouted "Hi, Axl! Where's Axl?" repeatedly. Guns N' Roses' video for the [[ballad]] "[[November Rain]]" won the MTV Video Music Award for best cinematography. During the show, the band performed "November Rain" with singer [[Elton John]]. Because of the dispute Rose had with Cobain, moments before the "November Rain" performance, Cobain spat on the keys of what he thought was Axl's piano. Cobain later revealed that he was shocked to see Elton John play on the piano he had spat on.<ref name=elton>{{cite web|url=http://egotvonline.com/2010/09/13/6-odd-facts-about-the-mtv-vmas/ |title=6 Odd Facts About The MTV VMA's |last1=Illuminati |first1=Chris |date=September 13, 2010 |work=egotvonline.com |publisher=Hutch Media |access-date=19 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914123407/http://egotvonline.com/2010/09/13/6-odd-facts-about-the-mtv-vmas/ |archive-date=September 14, 2010 }}</ref> During the commercial break, the Alien 3 Pepsi commercial was shown.

Radio [[shock jock]] Howard Stern appeared as [[Fartman (Howard Stern)|Fartman]], Stern's radio superhero, wearing a buttocks-exposing costume obviously inspired by Prince's outfit from the previous year. Stern was a presenter for best hard rock/metal performance with actor [[Luke Perry]] (after several other celebrities turned him down).

[[File:Madonna en Chelsea.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Madonna has presented several controversial performances in the show's history.]]
'''1993''': At the [[1993 MTV Video Music Awards]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] opened the show in a gender-bending performance of her song "[[Bye Bye Baby (Madonna song)|Bye Bye Baby]]," in which Madonna and her two backup singers, dressed in tuxedos and top hats, danced with women in corsets in a choreographed, highly sexual routine.<ref name="vma1993" />

[[RuPaul]] and [[Milton Berle]], who had had conflicts backstage, presented an award together. When Berle touched RuPaul's breasts, RuPaul ad-libbed the line "So you used to wear gowns, but now you're wearing diapers."<ref name="vma1993" />

Rapper [[Snoop Dogg]] presented the Best R&B Video award with [[Dr. Dre]] and [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]. At the time, Snoop was wanted in connection with the week old drive-by murder of an L.A. gang member.<ref name="vma1993" />

[[Janet Jackson]] closed the show with her performance of "[[That's the Way Love Goes (Janet Jackson song)|That's the Way Love Goes]]" & "[[If (Janet Jackson song)|If]]".

'''1994''': At the [[1994 MTV Video Music Awards]] on September 8, months after [[Madonna on Late Show with David Letterman|a profanity-laced appearance]] on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was announced to present the award for Best Video of the Year. She came out, arm-in-arm with an unannounced [[David Letterman]], to a wild ovation. At the microphone, Letterman told her "I'll be in the car.

Recently betrothed couple [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Lisa Marie Presley]] received a standing ovation as they walked on stage hand-in-hand.

'''1995''': At the [[1995 MTV Video Music Awards]], [[Hole (band)|Hole]] perform the song "[[Violet (Hole song)|Violet]]" from their major-label debut album ''[[Live Through This]]''. This was one of the first major televised performances given by frontwoman [[Courtney Love]] following the death of her husband [[Kurt Cobain]] and the death of her band's bassist [[Kristen Pfaff]] in 1994.  Before beginning the song, Love dedicated the performance to her husband and different people in the entertainment industry who had recently died: "This is for Kurt, and Kristen, and [[River Phoenix|River]], and [[Joe Cole (roadie)|Joe]], and today Joni Abbott, this is for you."

Backstage, after presenting an award to [[Beck]], the reunion soured bitterly, and reportedly, [[David Lee Roth]] and [[Eddie Van Halen]] nearly came to blows.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Several weeks later, the public learned that Van Halen would not reunite with Roth.
