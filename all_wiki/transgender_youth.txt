'''Transgender youth''' are children or adolescents who do not identify with the [[Sex assignment|sex they were assigned at birth]]. Because [[transgender]] youth are usually dependent on their parents for care, shelter, financial support, and other needs, and because most doctors are reluctant to provide medical treatments to them, transgender youth face different challenges compared to adults. There is a broad consensus among experts and professional associations that appropriate care may include supportive mental health care, social transition, and [[puberty blocker]]s, which delay puberty and the development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s to give children time to make decisions about more permanent courses of action.<ref name="WPATH">{{cite book |title=Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender-Nonconforming People|publisher=[[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]]|year=2012|url=https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/SOC%20v7/Standards%20of%20Care%20V7%20-%202011%20WPATH.pdf?_t=1605186324 |pages=20-21}}</ref><ref name="apahelp">{{cite web |title=Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=July 17, 2020 |url=https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf}}</ref><ref name="aap">{{cite web |title=Supporting and Caring For Transgender Children |publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]] |accessdate=July 17, 2020 |url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/Documents/solgbt_resource_transgenderchildren.pdf}}</ref>
==Coming out==
{{Main|Coming out}}
In many parts of the world, being transgender<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/31/health/transgender-costs-irpt/ |title=The high cost of being transgender |date=31 July 2015 |website=CNN |last=Jackson |first=Alyssa}}</ref> is not widely accepted by the public and as for transgender youth, they not only face discrimination but also can encounter family exclusion.<ref name=Said>{{Cite web |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/edge-of-eighteen/articles/2014/10/3/trans-gender-discrimination.html |title=Young trans people still struggling for social acceptance |date=3 October 2014 |website=Al Jazeera America |last=Said |first= Hashem |accessdate=21 April 2016}}</ref> Transgender youth may feel that they need to remain in [[Closeted|"the closet"]] until they feel that it is safe and appropriate to [[Coming out|come out]] and reveal their [[gender identity]] to their parents, family members, and friends. To "come out", according to Merriam-Webster,<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Definition of "come out" |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/come%20out}}</ref> means to openly declare something about oneself previously kept hidden or to openly declare one's homosexuality. For the [[LGBT]] community, to "come out" means to acknowledge one's sexual identity or gender identity and make it known to the public.

=== Family acceptance ===
Family acceptance holds a significant impact on the lives of transgender youth.<ref name=Said/> It may be impossible to predict a parent's reaction to the news of their child's gender identity and the process can be fraught for many transgender youths. In some cases, parents will react negatively to such news, and may disown the child or kick the youth out of the home. Current research suggests that transgender youth who have been entered into the juvenile justice system are more likely to have experienced family rejection, abuse, and/or abandonment compared to those youth who are not transgender as a result of "coming out" at a young age. Because transgender youth depend on their parents for support and acceptance, family exclusion can result in them becoming emotionally vulnerable and regretting their decision to come out.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2012/06/29/11730/the-unfair-criminalization-of-gay-and-transgender-youth/|title=The Unfair Criminalization of Gay and Transgender Youth|website=name |accessdate=21 April 2016}}</ref> On the other hand, some parents are very supportive and provide their children with aid to guide them through [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]].{{cn|date=February 2020}} For instance, parents can find gender-affirmative counselors and doctors, and connect their children with LGBTIQ support groups. Many parents join organizations such as PFLAG, so they can meet other parents and learn how to advocate for their children. Additionally, reactions of parents to transgender children can change over time. For example, parents who initially reacted with negativity and hostility may eventually come around to support their transgender children.

=== Support ===
Research has overwhelmingly indicated that familial support and acceptance of transgender youth has resulted in more positive life outcomes for the individual regarding their mental, physical, and emotional health.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Catalpa|first1=Jory M.|last2=McGuire|first2=Jenifer K.|date=1 February 2018|title=Family Boundary Ambiguity Among Transgender Youth|journal=Family Relations|volume=67|issue=1|pages=88–103|doi=10.1111/fare.12304|issn=1741-3729}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Le|first1=Victory|last2=Arayasirikul|first2=Sean|last3=Chen|first3=Yea-Hung|last4=Jin|first4=Harry|last5=Wilson|first5=Erin C|date=1 July 2016|title=Types of social support and parental acceptance among transfemale youth and their impact on mental health, sexual debut, history of sex work and condomless anal intercourse|journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society|volume=19|issue=3 (Suppl 2)|pages=20781|doi=10.7448/ias.19.3.20781|pmid=27431467|pmc=4949317|issn=1758-2652}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last1=Riley|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Sitharthan|first2=Gomathi|last3=Clemson|first3=Lindy|last4=Diamond|first4=Milton|author-link4= Milton Diamond|date=April 2013|title=Recognising the needs of gender-variant children and their parents|journal=Sex Education|volume=13|issue=6|pages=644–659|doi=10.1080/14681811.2013.796287|s2cid=146453141}}</ref>

Studies have indicated a number of ways that parents or guardians of transgender youth can show support and acceptance for their child with one of them being the opportunity for the child to speak about their gender identity. Transgender youth have found greater success and emotional stability when parents took on a supportive role rather than a controlling and dismissive stance. Troubleshooting problems during the transition as they arise, rather than pushing views on the child and dictating their process has allowed for healthier transitions.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":13">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/supporting-caring-for-transgender-children|title=Supporting & Caring for Transgender Children {{!}} Human Rights Campaign|website=Human Rights Campaign|access-date=20 April 2018}}</ref> Additionally, informing professionals and other critical individuals in the child's life aides in developing a support network for the transgender youth.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":13" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Katz-Wise|first1=Sabra L.|last2=Budge|first2=Stephanie L.|last3=Orovecz|first3=Joe J.|last4=Nguyen|first4=Bradford|last5=Nava-Coulter|first5=Brett|last6=Thomson|first6=Katharine|title=Imagining the future: Perspectives among youth and caregivers in the trans youth family study|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|volume=64|issue=1|pages=26–40|doi=10.1037/cou0000186|pmid=28068129|pmc=5224913|year=2017}}</ref>

Parents access to information is critical in aiding and advocating for transgender youth. Access to information supports parents in providing youth with resources regarding their gender identity such as medical care, counseling, educational literature, and local youth groups that can provide access to others in the transgender community.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":13" />

=== Health risks ===
Family acceptance among transgender youth predicts an increase in greater self-esteem, social support, and general health status. It also protects against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Caitlin|last2=Russell|first2=Stephen T.|last3=Huebner|first3=David|last4=Diaz|first4=Rafael|last5=Sanchez|first5=Jorge|date=1 November 2010 |title=Family Acceptance in Adolescence and the Health of LGBT Young Adults|journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nursing|volume=23|issue=4|pages=205–213|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6171.2010.00246.x|pmid=21073595|issn=1744-6171}}</ref> As recent as 2015, research has shown that in carefully selected patients, people who transition young suffer few ill effects,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pro/46/1/37/|title=Serving transgender youth: Challenges, dilemmas, and clinical examples|website=PsycNET.apa.org|accessdate=21 April 2016}}</ref> and maintain a higher level of functioning than before transitioning. Additionally, results of treatment such as counseling are considered better when it is offered at an earlier age.

Family behaviors can increase or decrease health risks of transgender youth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Grossman|first1=Arnold H.|last2=D'Augelli|first2=Anthony R.|date=1 October 2007 |title=Transgender Youth and Life-Threatening Behaviors|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|volume=37|issue=5|pages=527–537|doi=10.1521/suli.2007.37.5.527|pmid=17967119|issn=1943-278X}}</ref> Behaviors such as physically or verbally abusing the youth, pressuring the youth to become more masculine or feminine, excluding the youth from family events, etc. will lead to [http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/112309p6.shtml higher health risks] such as depression and suicide. On the positive end, behaviors such as supporting the youth's gender identity by talking about it and working to support their choice even though the parent might be uncomfortable make a significant impact on boosting the youth's confidence, which works to combat health risks associated with rejection.<ref name=":0" />

==Vulnerability==
Transgender youth are extremely [[Social vulnerability|vulnerable]] to a multitude of problems, including [[substance use disorder]]s, [[Youth suicide|suicide]], [[Child abuse|childhood abuse]], [[Child sexual abuse|sexual abuse/assault]], and [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref name="Grossman">{{cite journal | last1 = Grossman | first1 = Arnold H. | last2 = D'augelli | first2 = Anthony R. | year = 2006 | title = Transgender youth: Invisible and vulnerable | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 111–128 | doi=10.1300/j082v51n01_06| pmid = 16893828| s2cid = 2939809 }}</ref>

===Gender dysphoria===
[[Gender dysphoria]] is a strong, persistent discomfort and distress with one's gender, anatomy, birth sex, and even societal attitudes toward their gender variance.<ref>{{Cite journal
| last = Stein
| first = Edward
| title = Commentary on the Treatment of Gender Variant and Gender Dysphoric Children and Adolescents: Common Themes and Ethical Reflections

}}</ref> Transgender youth who experience gender dysphoria tend to be very conscious of their body; appearance, weight, and other people's opinions of their body may become very important. Body esteem of several transgender youth was measured in an interview in three categories (personal satisfaction of appearance, personal satisfaction of weight, and perceived satisfaction of others of one's body appearance). It was found that those transgender youth who experienced less personal satisfaction with their weight and who perceived others’ satisfaction with their body as worse were more likely to practice life-threatening behaviors than those who were more satisfied with their weight and thought that others view their body more positively.<ref name="GrossmanII" /> A part of Gender Dysphoria is Gender Incongruence, which is the disconnect between gender and sex.  Incongruence, in its most basic form, is the emotional and/or mental part of dysphoria.

===Physical, sexual, and verbal abuse===
Transgender youth are at an increased risk for [[physical abuse|physical]], [[verbal abuse|verbal]], and [[sexual abuse]]. Children who experience physical abuse, verbal abuse, and sexual abuse are also more likely to identify as being gender dysphoric. This evidence is not clear as to the relationship between abuse and sexual identity in regards to which is the cause and which is the effect.   Regardless,  it does show a relationship between childhood abuse and gender identity.<ref name="GrossmanII" /> There is evidence that indicates around 75% of transgender youth were verbally abused by their parents or caregivers, and around 35% had faced physical abuse by the hand of their caregiver.<ref name="GrossmanII" /> As one transgender youth said, "Throughout my whole life, I was abused physically and mentally by relatives in my family. Have marks on my body. I have things that I remember happened to me."<ref name="Grossman" /> Youth who have parental support of their preferred gender presentation are much more likely to be better off in several ways: mentally, financially, academically, etc. Transgender youth who face physical abuse may be forced to leave their homes, or choose to leave, which can be a particularly traumatic experience. The lack of housing was found to often lead to financial difficulties for such youth.  Lack of support at home and constant harassment at school may lead to academic difficulties for the youth as well, who face a much higher drop out level compared to their cisgender counterparts.<ref name="Grossman" />

=== Homelessness and survival sex ===
In the USA, according to the National Healthcare for the Homeless Council, 1 in 5 LGBT youth have unstable housing or lack housing altogether.<ref name=":5">{{cite journal|title = Gender Minority and Homeless Transgender Population|journal = National Health Care for the Homeless Council : In Focus |date=2014 |volume = 3|issue = 1}}</ref> As a result, it is estimated that between 20-40% of [[homeless youth]] are a part of the LGBT population.<ref name=":0" /> Reasons for LGBT youth not being able to have stable housing include family rejection/conflict, varying forms of violence, and difficulty within various institutions such as school or the [[foster care]] system.<ref name=":5" /> Even when LGBT youth find themselves in homeless shelters, they are not having their needs met even within [[homeless shelter]]s leaving them at disproportionate rates on the streets compared to their [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and [[cisgender]] peers, who fit within the gendered housing they are given and do not require additional services in their shelter placement.<ref name="Housing">{{cite web|title = Housing & Homelessness|url = http://www.transequality.org/issues/housing-homelessness|website = National Center for Transgender Equality}}</ref>

One practice that has resulted from transgender youth's inability to attain shelter that cares for their needs is to turn to [[survival sex]] for their money and shelter needs. Survival sex is the act of engaging in sexual activity with another individual or the act of selling sex in order to meet one's basic survival needs.<ref name=":1" /> A recent multi city study found that about one in four homeless and runaway youth has engaged in survival sex.<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> Transactions typically result in the youth receiving monetary value, but also can be utilized to gain a bed for the night, a meal, or clothing. While there is an awareness of the possible dangers associated with survival sex, it is often reported that a sense of pride in being able to support oneself accompanies the activity or the positivity of being able to eat and have somewhere to rest that night. Dangers do lurk when it comes to this transaction, primarily being the stigma that results from the transaction and the possibility of contracting an STI/STD ([[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted infection/disease]]).<ref name=":1" />

==== Lack of access to healthcare ====
In the past, transgender youth faced many hardships in obtaining medical treatment for [[gender dysphoria]]. This lack of access was often due to doctors refusing to treat youth or youth fearing negative reactions from health care providers. [[Psychiatry|Psychiatrists]] and [[endocrinologist]]s and family physicians now have clear guidelines on how to provide care to trans* youth of early puberty through its completion.  These are in wide use in Europe, UK, and in North America.<ref>Endocrine Society Guidelines The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, Volume 102, Issue 11, 1 November 2017, Pages 3869–3903, https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2017-01658
• http://sherbourne.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Guidelines-and-Protocols-for-Comprehensive-
Primary-Care-for-Trans-Clients-2015.pdf</ref> While in other countries, doctors may be generally reluctant to provide [[Hormone replacement therapy (trans)|hormone therapy]] to youths under 16, and obtaining [[sex reassignment surgery]] prior to the age of 18 is almost impossible in most countries. Some of the medical professionals who are permitted to prescribe hormones include medical providers, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sentinel|first1=Orlando|title=Clinics to start hormone therapy services for transgender people|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/os-planned-parenthood-new-hrt-service-20160927-story.html|website=OrlandoSentinel.com}}</ref> Many youth who have used hormones to develop desired secondary male or female sex characteristics have obtained these hormones illicitly. This can be potentially dangerous, and can result in a multitude of health problems for the youth, including improper pubertal growth and HIV due to contaminated needles. [[Sexually transmitted infection]]s are a large health problem for transgender teens as well, as sexual partners often do not perceive these youth as health risks, especially since male-to-female youth cannot become pregnant. This trend of unprotected sex among the transgender population puts them at increased risk and has led to higher numbers of STIs among the group<ref name="Grossman" /> However, the latest revision of the [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People]] has addressed the needs of transgender children.

==== Existing healthcare options ====
When an individual is transitioning from female to male (FTM) or male to female (MTF), there are several avenues<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|title = Home - The Transgender Center|url = http://www.thetransgendercenter.com/|website = www.thetransgendercenter.com |accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref> that are available to them pendant upon their financial capabilities, insurance's agreement to cover costs, and personal desire to utilize these options. While these options do exist, many of them are labeled off limits to minors (individuals under the age of 18). One of the options that does exist for minors is the use of puberty blockers, which in 2013 were officially stated as not damaging to bone health at the Endocrine Society's 95 Annual Meeting in San Francisco.<ref name=":6" /> In puberty, the mass of bones is built significantly, so this finding holds great importance in allowing transgender youth to keep from undergoing the psychological damage that may accompany their bodies going through a puberty that is not consistent with their [[gender identity]]. Puberty blockers are believed to put the succession of puberty on pause and can reverse any changes that had been made. Typically puberty blockers, which are reversible are first administered between the ages of 12–14 years of age, this is the age block because 16 years of age is believed to be too late.<ref name=":6">{{cite web |title = Medical Intervention in Transgender Adolescents Appear to Be Safe and Effective|url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-06/tes-mii061513.php |website = EurekAlert!

[[Norman Spack]], an endocrinologist who primarily has worked with intersex patients, has been a forerunner in helping youth navigate the transition process and educate others. His work is guided by his desire to see the suicide rates amongst untreated transgender individuals go down and to keep youth from undergoing psychological trauma that can accompany puberty when they do not identify. Spack is inspired by the research done in Dutch nations in their use of [[puberty blocker]]s and affirms this choice, this affirmation stems from the fact that early administration of cross sex hormones causes stunts in growth, issues of infertility, and other health issues. When this procedure of puberty blockers and cross sex hormones are followed, transitional surgery is then granted upon turning 18 years old.<ref name=":7" /> Spack boasts a number of successful and well-known patients around the world, working with youth who cannot follow this prescription due to the height they may end up, one of these successes being a young woman named Jackie from England.<ref name=":7">{{cite web|last1 = Spack|first1 = Norman|title = How I Help Transgender Teens Become Who They Want To Be |url = https://www.ted.com/talks/norman_spack_how_i_help_transgender_teens_become_who_they_want_to_be?language=en|website = TED |accessdate=10 October 2015}}</ref>

For those who are above age 18 and do not require the consent of an adult, there is a myriad of options<ref name=":9" /> available if they wish to transition. For those wishing to transition from male to female, options consist of facial feminisation surgery, vaginoplasty, breast augmentation surgery, and cross-sex hormones. For those wishing to transition from female to male, options consist of penile construction surgery, breast reduction surgery, and cross- sex hormones.<ref name=":8">{{cite journal|last1 = Milrod|first1 = Christine|title = How Young is Too Young: Ethical Concerns in Genital Surgery of the Transgender MTF Adolescent |journal = Journal of Sexual Medicine |date=2014 |volume = 11|issue = 2|pages = 338–346|doi=10.1111/jsm.12387|pmid = 24238576}}</ref> In order for any individual to receive these medical treatments, they must have a written diagnosis of gender dysphoria and have undergone up to a year's worth of therapy if they are a [[United States]] citizen.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV |publisher = American Psychiatric Association|year = 1978 |url= https://www.aclu.org/files/images/asset_upload_file155_30369.pdf |pages = 576–582}}</ref> If they are a citizen of [[Malta]], there is a quick and relatively simple paperwork process to change their gender marker, in contrast, the United States has a difficult and extensive process that requires medical proof of need and returning to your home state to obtain various legal documents.

===Bullying===
School settings can be some of the toughest for transgender youth. Several problems may be faced at schools, including verbal and physical harassment and assault, [[sexual harassment]], social exclusion and isolation, and other interpersonal problems with peers. Transgender students were much more likely than their peers to report harassment, assault, and feeling unsafe in school settings.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greytak|first1=Emily|last2=Kosciw|first2=Joseph|last3=Diaz|first3=Elizabeth|title=Harsh Realities: The Experiences of Transgender Youth in Our Nation's Schools|url=http://www.glsen.org/research|publisher=GLSEN Research |date=2009 |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> These experiences vary between individuals and schools attended. Larger schools tend to have safer climates for transgender students, as do schools with more low income and religious and ethnic [[minority group|minorities]].<ref name="Kosciw">{{cite journal |last1= Kosciw |first1= Joseph G. |last2=Greytak |first2= Emily A. | last3 = Diaz | first3 = Elizabeth M. | year = 2009 | title = Who, what, where, when, and why: Demographic and ecological factors contributing to hostile school climate for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 38 | issue = 7| pages = 976–988 | doi=10.1007/s10964-009-9412-1| pmid = 19636740|s2cid= 14479123 }}</ref>

Results of a 2009 study of 6th through 12th grade transgender students showed that most experienced a hostile school climate with regular harassment from peers. Eighty two percent of these youth reported that they felt unsafe at school because of their gender identity, and almost 90% reported experiencing homophobic harassment from peers frequently. A majority of these students also reported physical harassment at school, with nearly half reporting that they had been punched, kicked, or injured with a weapon. Sexual harassment among these students was also reported with alarming frequency (76%).<ref name="NCTE">{{cite web 
|url=http://www.eusccr.com/10.%20national%20center%20for%20transgender%20equality.pdf |title=Peer Violence and Bullying Against transgender and Gender Nonconforming Youth|publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality |accessdate=13 May 2017}}</ref> Restrooms and locker rooms pose an especially high threat to transgender students. They frequently reported fear and anxiety about using these facilities at school because of experiences of harassment by both peers and adults when using them. Negative comments about gender presentation may be frequently overheard in these places, and surveyed students have reported being "pushed around," "getting the crap beat out of them," and "getting their asses kicked" by peers.<ref name="NCTE" />

Unfortunately, school administrations often do not take reports of [[victimisation]] of transgender students seriously. Only a third of transgender students who reported victimization to school staff members feel that their situation was taken care of adequately and effectively. The other two thirds often run into situations where the school staff members blame the victimized students. One student, when reporting bullying, said that they were told "that I need to stop flaunting my sexuality".<ref name="NCTE" /> School administrations often single out transgender students and discipline them for doing things such as wearing appropriate clothes for their gender identity, using restrooms consistent with their gender identity, and insisting on using their preferred name and personal pronouns. These things serve no educational purpose and only isolate transgender students further.<ref name="NCTE" />

High drop out rates and low grade point averages seem to plague the transgender population. The severity and frequency of bullying and harassment are directly correlated to these things. In one study of transgender youth, three quarters of the participants dropped out of school, almost all citing the main reason the constant acts of violence against them due to their gender identity. Anti-transgender bullying in schools has also been found to directly correlate with other negative outcomes, such as homelessness, unemployment, incarceration, and drug use.<ref name="NCTE" />

=== Suicide ===
Though several studies that estimate life-threatening behavior for gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth have been done, few have been done regarding transgender youth, and thus comparable estimates do not exist. The few studies that have been done, however, have all concluded that transgender youth are at increased risk even over their gay, lesbian, and bisexual counterparts. A 2007 study of transgender youth found that, of the youth interviewed, about half had seriously contemplated ending their own lives. Of those who had thought about [[suicide]], about half had actually made an attempt.

Youth are generally predisposed to life-threatening behaviors due to a number of conditions, such as self-hatred, victimisation via [[bullying]], [[substance abuse]], etc. Transgender youth may also face [[victimization]] from peers and family members’ negative reactions to their atypical gender presentation, increasing their risk of life-threatening behaviors. Of the transgender youth who were interviewed and reported an attempt at taking their own life in the aforementioned study, almost all had been verbally abused by their parents, and a significant number had been physically abused as well. In comparing those transgender youth who had and had not attempted suicide, there were significant differences in family relations, peer relations, and school performance <ref name="GrossmanII" /> Awareness of the suicide rates of LGBT youth spiked post-2010, as a result of significant publicity being given to the recent suicides of [[Death of Leelah Alcorn|Leelah Alcorn]], Skylar Lee, and Ash Haffner only being a few.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Skylar Lee and the Crisis of Transgender Youth Suicides in America|url = http://mic.com/articles/126218/skylar-lee-and-the-crisis-of-transgender-youth-suicides-in-america|website = Mic |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref>

Critics such as [[Andrew Gilligan]] have claimed that figures for youth transgender suicide are grossly exaggerated by transgender groups. Gilligan in particular has claimed that rates in the United Kingdom are less than 1%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk|title=Trans groups under fire for huge rise in child referrals|last=Gilligan|first=Andrew|date=25 November 2018|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=25 November 2018}}</ref> Numerous studies, though, across various countries, have noted suicide attempt rates for transgender children ranging from 30-50%, at least double the rates of age-matched cisgender peers.<ref name="Bachmann">{{cite journal |last1=Bachmann |first1=S |title=Epidemiology of Suicide and the Psychiatric Perspective. |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |date=6 July 2018 |volume=15 |issue=7 |pages=1425 |doi=10.3390/ijerph15071425 |pmid=29986446 |pmc=6068947 }}</ref><ref name="IJPM">{{cite journal |last1=Virupaksha |first1=HG |last2=Muralidhar |first2=D |last3=Ramakrishna |first3=J |title=Suicide and Suicidal Behavior among Transgender Persons. |journal=Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine |date=2016 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=505–509 |doi=10.4103/0253-7176.194908 |pmid=28031583 |pmc=5178031 }}</ref><ref name="PediatricsSep2018">{{cite journal |last1=Toomey |first1=Russell B. |last2=Syvertsen |first2=Amy K. |last3=Shramko |first3=Maura |title=Transgender Adolescent Suicide Behavior |journal=Pediatrics |date=11 September 2018 |volume=142 |issue=4 |pages=e20174218 |doi=10.1542/peds.2017-4218 |pmid=30206149 |pmc=6317573 |issn=0031-4005}}</ref><ref name="WaPoBecker">{{cite news |last1=Stanley-Becker |first1=Isaac |title=More than half of transgender male adolescents attempt suicide, study says |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/14/more-than-half-of-transgender-male-adolescents-attempt-suicide-study-says/?noredirect=on |accessdate=25 November 2018 |work=Washington Post |publisher=Washington Post |date=14 September 2018 }}</ref>

=== Court experiences ===
Individuals involved in the juvenile justice system have reported that transgender youth have an exceptionally difficult experience. This is because transgender youth are in a vulnerable stage and unlike cisgender or LGBQIA youth, a sentence to a juvenile detention facility could mean that their transition is stopped while they are detained. That is damaging to their mental health, and an experience that other youth are not subjected to.

Juvenile justice professionals are bound to the rules of ethics to ensure all youth are treated fairly. However, many transgender youth felt as if they were not adequately represented or respected in court.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushrnetwork.org/sites/ushrnetwork.org/files/locked-in-final-report.pdf|title=Locked In. Interactions with the Criminal Justice and Child Welfare Systems for LGBTQ Youth, YMSM, and YWSW Who Engage in Survival Sex.|last=Dank|first=Meredith|date=2015}}</ref> This included treatment from prosecutors, court-appointed defense attorneys, and judges.<ref name=":11" />  Whether it is ignoring the appropriate pronouns, or in one case a judge refusing to hear the case of one transgender girl due to the way she was dressed.<ref name=":11" /> Judges are supposed to refrain from prejudice and biases while maintaining that attorneys abide by those same guidelines as well.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009">{{Cite report |url=http://www.nclrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/hidden_injustice.pdf |title=Hidden Injustice: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth in Juvenile Courts |last1=Majd |first1=Katayoon |last2=Marksamer |first2=Jody |date=Fall 2009 |publisher=Legal Services for Children (San Francisco, CA), National Juvenile Defender Center (San Francisco, CA), and National Center for Lesbian Rights (Washington D.C.) |last3=Reyes |first3=Carolyn}}</ref>

Prosecutors are required to ensure that all individuals are treated fairly and are not discriminated against.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/> In one case, a prosecutor requested confinement for a transgender defendant rather than being returned home. The judge agreed to the sentence, even though they did not seem suicidal, dangerous, or appear to be a flight risk.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/> An additional problem for some transgender youth is having an effective and zealous defense. Some report to have had a defense attorney who went directly against their client's wishes due to his or her own personal beliefs.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/> In some cases, defenders told the courts to leave transgender individuals in places in which they wanted to be removed, because those youths felt those places were unsafe due to lack of support and acceptance.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/>

=== Detention centers ===
According to "A Quick Guide" (2012), after court sentencing, youth are placed in detention centers where they are processed and assigned their placements within the facility. During intake, the goal is to address safety concerns of the youth, identify those who are vulnerable, and then house juveniles based upon their birth gender.<ref>A Quick Guide for LGBTI Policy Development forYouth Confinement Facilities. (2012). Retrieved from <nowiki>http://static.nicic.gov/Library/026701.pdf</nowiki></ref> Regardless of placements, transgender youth are targets for violence, and about eighty percent of individuals surveyed reported that the lack of safety in facilities as a serious concern.<ref name="Hunt, J. 2012">Hunt, J., & Moodie-Mills, A. (2012). ''The unfair criminalization of gay and transgender youth: An overview of the experiences of LGBT Youth in the Juvenile Justice System''. Washington, DC: Center for American Progress.</ref> The survey of youth confined made no distinction between transgender youth and LGB youth, as their experiences are similar. Furthermore, the placement of LGBTQ youth is a complicated issue because their wants and needs have to be balanced with what is best for their safety.

In most facilities, youth are forced to return to their birth gender.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/> The transformation process varies for each individual, but consists of boys cutting their hair if they grew it out, and forcing individuals to wear gender appropriate style and fitting clothing. Medical experts state that this process puts the transgender youth in distress and undermines their emotional stability.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/> In contrast, juvenile detention center staff claims that this process is in the best interest for transgender youth and for their peers in the center because it decreases the opportunity for physical and sexual violence.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/>

Some detentions centers stated they have more than enough difficulties with housing girls and boys on the same campus, and mixing in transgender youth according to their chosen gender in one dormitory would only create more problems.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/> While there are legitimate safety concerns in housing placements, regulations without flexibility are not the best solution for the transgender youth. One pediatrician believes that transgender (male-to-female) girls should be housed in female units because they are safer there.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/> With other females, they would not run the risk of being exposed to as much physical abuse as they would in the male centers, and acknowledging their transition preserves their mental health.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/>

Transgender (female-to-male) boys are harder to place because of the high level of violence in the boy's facilities, and the high chance of sexual assault.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/> It is a risky move to place trans boys with other boys because of the unpredictable nature of what can occur if their birth gender was revealed. Jamal, a trans boy, expressed concern about his safety in male units, saying "I’m not going to be ignorant...I know how males are."<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/>

As a result, transgender youth are frequently placed in solitarily confinement.<ref name="Hunt, J. 2012"/> The centers assert that the solitarily confinement is for their safety because the facilities cannot keep them protected if they are mixed in with the general population.<ref name="Hunt, J. 2012"/> However, confinement strips them of any recreational and educational programming that is imperative to maintaining mental stability.<ref name="Hunt, J. 2012"/> Oftentimes these placements are based on the stereotype that LGBTQ youth are sexual predators, and should not be around other confined youth, or with individuals of the opposite gender,<ref name="Hunt, J. 2012"/> therefore isolation is often an automatic process. One transgender youth in New York was placed in isolation for three weeks, despite her request to be placed in general population.<ref name="Feinstein, R. 2001">Feinstein, R., Greenblatt, A., Hass, L., Kohn, S., & Rana, J., (2001). ''A Report on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered Youth in the New York Juvenile Justice System''. Urban Justice Center, New York, NY.</ref> Following her isolation, she was placed in observation for three months, whereas others are only in observation for one week.<ref name="Feinstein, R. 2001"/>

Additionally, the safety of detention facilities is a primary issue as reported from LGBT youth in detention centers and individuals who work in the juvenile justice system.<ref name="Woronoff, R. 2006">Woronoff, R., Estrada, R., Sommer, S., & Marzullo, M. A. (2006). ''Out of the margins: A report on Regional Listening Forums High- Lighting the Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Youth in Care.'' Washington, DC: Child Welfare League of America and New York, NY: Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund.</ref> Transgender youth are at risk for abuse from both staff and other youth in the center.<ref name="Hunt, J. 2012"/> This can include staff abusing the youth or ignoring incidents of rape and abuse.<ref name="Hunt, J. 2012"/> Youth who were interviewed stated that they feared for their safety, and complaints about abuse went unheard and unresolved.<ref name="Woronoff, R. 2006"/>

Furthermore, staff members in juvenile detention centers are not properly trained in order to deal with some of the issues faced by transgender youth, such as use of proper pronouns or adequate clothing choices.<ref name="Holsinger, K. 2014">Holsinger, K., & Hodge, J. P. (2014). ''The Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Girls in Juvenile Justice Systems.'' Feminist Criminology, 11(1), 23–47.</ref> This can be due to the varying amount of comfort around the issue of transgender youth and sexual identification, which has an impact on the treatment the youth receive.<ref name="Holsinger, K. 2014"/> For example, one transgender girl stated that she did not have problems with the boys in her detention center, but she did with the staff.<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/> She said the staff would call her "him" and "he," even though she identified as female,<ref name="Majd, K. 2009"/> and they refused to accept her transition from male to female. Ultimately, there needs to be a better understanding of transgender youth, realizing that they are not predatory, and increasing protections for their safety.<ref name="Woronoff, R. 2006"/>

==Ensuring the child's security==
A national survey conducted by [[GLSEN]] found that 75% of transgender youth feel unsafe at school, and those who are able to persevere have significantly lower GPAs and are more likely to miss school out of concern for their safety.<ref>http://www.glsen.org/learn/research/books-journals/JYA2009a</ref> These students also reported to be less likely to plan on continuing their education as a result to their unsafe environment.<ref>[http://www.transequality.org/issues/youth-students Youth & Students | National Center for Transgender Equality<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In recent years, some transgender children have received counseling and, in some cases, medical treatment for their condition, as well as the ability to change their [[gender identity]]. In some countries, schools are working to accommodate gender identity and expression by eliminating traditional gendered activities.<ref name="lelchuck">Lelchuk I (27 August 2006). When is it OK for boys to be girls, and girls to be boys? ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''</ref>

A safe school climate is essential for transgender, gender dysphoric, and gender non-conforming children, who likely experience stress and anxiety due to their desire to transition or display themselves as a different gender. While many schools have become more accepting and allow children to express their desired gender identity, current research shows that there is an increased amount of harassment, bullying, indifference by school staff, and antigay victimization towards transgender and gender non-conforming youth.<ref>{{Cite journal

Schools must enforce LGBTQ-related policies and implement necessary staff trainings to minimize these social hazards for transgender and gender non-conforming children. To accommodate the transgender students, In July 2018, 40 schools in UK banned skirts to make school uniform gender neutral.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/uk/431573-secondary-schools-ban-skirts/|title=40 schools in England ban girls from wearing skirts to accommodate transgender students|work=RT International|access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>

Families with a young child that identifies as a different gender and chooses to alter their gender role through dress or behaviors may respect their child's decision, and sometimes, may decide to relocate the child to another area in order to afford the young person the best opportunity to live in their desired gender role among a novel set of peers and community. This helps protect transgender children from [[social rejection|peer rejection]], [[bullying]], and [[harassment]].

Families with a transgender child living within an intolerant community may face challenging issues. [[Gwen Araujo]] of [[Newark, California]] was a young person who was living as female, when she had been assigned to the male gender at birth. When her trans status was revealed at a party she attended, she became the victim of violent crimes that resulted in her death.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Gwen Araujo {{!}} LGBTHistoryMonth.com|url = http://lgbthistorymonth.com/gwen-araujo?tab=biography|website = lgbthistorymonth.com |accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref>

=== Creating a trans-inclusive educational environment ===
Many transgender students feel as if they must hide their true identity when entering the school environment. A major part of why transgender people may feel this way is because school administrators as well as the general non-LGBTQ student population are not provided with the necessary knowledge required to help support their transgender peers.<ref name="Sears">{{Cite book|last=Sears|first=James|date=11 January 2013|title=Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Issues in Education|doi=10.4324/9780203462591|isbn=9780203462591}}</ref>

== Acceptance of transgender youth ==
On a global scale, transgender individuals face varying levels of acceptance or denial based on their location's attitude towards the LGBT community. Factors that influence acceptance or denial of their identity tend to surround political interests, religious affiliations, and whether their identity is still labeled as a mental health disorder.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|title = The Global Divide on Homosexuality|url = http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/|website = Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project |accessdate=16 December 2015|date = 4 June 2013}}</ref> Acceptance levels tend to predominantly be higher in countries located in the Global North.<ref name=":10" /> Despite higher levels, acceptance rates still vary from country to country, Malta and the United States of America are two examples of countries where legislation and the social acceptance levels have curated a safer environment for transgender individuals.

=== Malta ===
In early April 2015, Malta adopted what some have declared as a groundbreaking bill in [[Parliament]] titled the 'Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act' (GIGESC Bill). The bill allows minors to have their parents apply to have their legal gender marker changed for them or to have a gender marker held from their birth certificate until their gender identity has been self-determined. The bill also prevents surgeries from being performed on [[intersex]] infants until their [[gender identity]] has been discovered; the parents are no longer required to make an immediate decision and medical personnel cannot override this decision because the bill also outlaws the request to view medical records.<ref name="TGEU">{{cite web|last1=Kohler|first1=Richard|title=Malta Adopts Ground-breaking Trans and Intersex Law – TGEU Press Release|url=http://tgeu.org/malta-adopts-ground-breaking-trans-intersex-law/|website=Transgender Europe|publisher=TGEU|accessdate=3 December 2016}}</ref> For individuals who are no longer a minor, they only need to request a notary for self declaration, again the individual cannot be asked for medical records when changing their legal gender or performing any other legal changes in conjunction to their gender identity. Also, the entire process can be completed in less than thirty days.<ref name="TGEU"/> In order to continue Malta's progress in LGBT protections and rights, the government has set up a council called the LGBTIQ Consultative Council, this action shows their commitment and dedication to actually enforcing the Bill. While there are other European countries who have created allowances and encouraged acceptance of transgender individuals, most require [[compulsory sterilization]] and have lengthy legal proceedings.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Document {{!}} Amnesty International|url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/EUR01/001/2014/en/ |website= www.amnesty.org |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref>

Many transgender youth constantly face struggles in attempting to transition and to be accepted in the U.S. According to the [[Human Rights Campaign]], in 32 states an individual can be fired for being transgender and in 33 states an individual can be refused housing.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Transgender FAQ {{!}} Resources|url = http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/transgender-faq#11|website = Human Rights Campaign |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Housing for LGBT People: What You Need to Know About Property Ownership |url = http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/housing-for-lgbt-people-what-you-need-to-know-about-property-ownership-and|website = Human Rights Campaign |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref> Transgender people are also disproportionately targeted for hate crimes.
