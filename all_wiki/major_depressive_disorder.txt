'''Major depressive disorder''' ('''MDD'''), also known simply as '''depression''', is a [[mental disorder]] characterized by at least two weeks of pervasive [[depression (mood)|low mood]].

Major depression frequently [[Comorbidity|co-occurs]] with other psychiatric problems.

Depression and [[pain]] often co-occur. One or more pain symptoms are present in 65% of depressed patients, and anywhere from 5 to 85% of patients with pain will be suffering from depression, depending on the setting; there is a lower prevalence in general practice, and higher in specialty clinics. The diagnosis of depression is often delayed or missed, and the outcome can worsen if the depression is noticed but completely misunderstood.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bair MJ, Robinson RL, Katon W, Kroenke K |title=Depression and pain comorbidity: a literature review |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=163 |issue=20 |pages=2433–45 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14609780 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.20.2433 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/20/2433(fulltext) |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Depression is also associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], independent of other known risk factors, and is itself linked directly or indirectly to risk factors such as smoking and obesity. People with major depression are less likely to follow medical recommendations for treating and preventing [[cardiovascular disorders]], which further increases their risk of medical complications.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Swardfager W, Herrmann N, Marzolini S, Saleem M, Farber SB, Kiss A, Oh PI, Lanctôt KL |title=Major depressive disorder predicts completion, adherence, and outcomes in cardiac rehabilitation: a prospective cohort study of 195 patients with coronary artery disease |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=72 |issue=9 |pages=1181–88 |date=September 2011 |pmid=21208573 |doi=10.4088/jcp.09m05810blu}}</ref> In addition, [[cardiologists]] may not recognize underlying depression that complicates a cardiovascular problem under their care.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schulman J, Shapiro BA|year=2008|journal=Psychiatric Times|volume=25 |issue=9 |title=Depression and Cardiovascular Disease: What Is the Correlation?|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/depression/article/10168/1171821}}</ref>

Depression often coexists with physical disorders common among the elderly, such as [[stroke]], other [[cardiovascular diseases]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yohannes AM, Baldwin RC|title=Medical Comorbidities in Late-Life Depression|journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=25 |issue=14|year=2008 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/depression/article/10168/1358135}}</ref>

[[Child abuse|Childhood abuse]], either physical, sexual or psychological, are all risk factors for depression, among other psychiatric issues that co-occur such as anxiety and [[drug abuse]]. Childhood trauma also correlates with severity of depression, lack of response to treatment and length of illness. However, some are more susceptible to developing mental illness such as depression after trauma, and various genes have been suggested to control susceptibility.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Saveanu RV, Nemeroff CB |title=Etiology of depression: genetic and environmental factors |journal=The Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=51–71 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22370490 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2011.12.001 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221866686 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
{{see|Biology of depression|Epigenetics of depression}}
The pathophysiology of depression is not yet understood, but the current theories center around [[monoamine]]rgic systems, the [[circadian rhythm]], immunological dysfunction, [[HPA axis]] dysfunction and structural or functional abnormalities of emotional circuits.

The monoamine theory, derived from the efficacy of monoaminergic drugs in treating depression, was the dominant theory until recently {{when|date=May 2020}}. The theory postulates that insufficient activity of [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s is the primary cause of depression. Evidence for the monoamine theory comes from multiple areas. Firstly, acute depletion of [[tryptophan]], a necessary precursor of [[serotonin]], a monoamine, can cause depression in those in remission or relatives of depressed patients; this suggests that decreased serotonergic neurotransmission is important in depression.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruhé HG, Mason NS, Schene AH |title=Mood is indirectly related to serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine levels in humans: a meta-analysis of monoamine depletion studies |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=331–59 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17389902 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001949 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Secondly, the correlation between depression risk and polymorphisms in the [[5-HTTLPR]] gene, which codes for serotonin receptors, suggests a link. Third, decreased size of the [[locus coeruleus]], decreased activity of [[tyrosine hydroxylase]], increased density of [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor]], and evidence from rat models suggest decreased [[Adrenergic nervous system|adrenergic]] neurotransmission in depression.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Delgado PL, Moreno FA |title=Role of norepinephrine in depression |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=61 Suppl 1 |pages=5–12 |year=2000 |pmid=10703757 }}</ref> Furthermore, decreased levels of [[homovanillic acid]], altered response to [[dextroamphetamine]], responses of depressive symptoms to [[dopamine receptor]] agonists, decreased [[dopamine receptor D1]] binding in the [[striatum]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Savitz JB, Drevets WC |title=Neuroreceptor imaging in depression |journal=Neurobiology of Disease |volume=52 |pages=49–65 |date=April 2013 |pmid=22691454 |doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2012.06.001 |doi-access=free }}</ref> and [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] of [[dopamine receptor]] genes implicate [[dopamine]], another monoamine, in depression.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasler G |title=Pathophysiology of depression: do we have any solid evidence of interest to clinicians? |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=155–61 |date=October 2010 |pmid=20975857 |pmc=2950973 |doi=10.1002/j.2051-5545.2010.tb00298.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dunlop BW, Nemeroff CB |title=The role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of depression |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=327–37 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17339521 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.64.3.327 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6466257}}</ref> Lastly, increased activity of [[monoamine oxidase]], which degrades monoamines, has been associated with depression.<ref name="Meyer06">{{cite journal |vauthors=Meyer JH, Ginovart N, Boovariwala A, Sagrati S, Hussey D, Garcia A, Young T, Praschak-Rieder N, Wilson AA, Houle S |title=Elevated monoamine oxidase a levels in the brain: an explanation for the monoamine imbalance of major depression |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1209–16 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17088501 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.11.1209|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, this theory is inconsistent with the fact that serotonin depletion does not cause depression in healthy persons, the fact that antidepressants instantly increase levels of monoamines but take weeks to work, and the existence of atypical antidepressants which can be effective despite not targeting this pathway.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first1=Kenneth L |editor-last1=Davis |editor-first2=Dennis |editor-last2=Charney |editor-first3=Joseph T |editor-last3=Coyle |editor-first4=Charles |editor-last4=Nemeroff |name-list-style=vanc |title=Neuropsychopharmacology: the fifth generation of progress: an official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology|date=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-2837-9|pages=1139–63|edition=5th}}</ref> One proposed explanation for the therapeutic lag, and further support for the deficiency of monoamines, is a desensitization of self-inhibition in [[raphe nuclei]] by the increased serotonin mediated by antidepressants.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Adell A |title=Revisiting the role of raphe and serotonin in neuropsychiatric disorders |journal=The Journal of General Physiology |volume=145 |issue=4 |pages=257–59 |date=April 2015 |pmid=25825168 |doi=10.1085/jgp.201511389 |pmc=4380212}}</ref> However, disinhibition of the dorsal raphe has been proposed to occur as a result of ''decreased'' serotonergic activity in tryptophan depletion, resulting in a depressed state mediated by increased serotonin.

Before diagnosing major depressive disorder, a doctor generally performs a medical examination and selected investigations to rule out other causes of symptoms. These include blood tests measuring [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] and [[thyroxine]] to exclude [[hypothyroidism]]; [[Blood tests#Biochemical analysis|basic electrolytes]] and serum [[calcium]] to rule out a [[Metabolic disorder|metabolic disturbance]]; and a [[Complete blood count|full blood count]] including [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]] to rule out a [[systemic infection]] or chronic disease.<ref name="lancet">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dale J, Sorour E, Milner G |year=2008 |title=Do psychiatrists perform appropriate physical investigations for their patients?

===DSM and ICD criteria===
The most widely used criteria for diagnosing depressive conditions are found in the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' and the [[World Health Organization]]'s ''[[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' which uses the name ''depressive episode'' for a single episode and ''recurrent depressive disorder'' for repeated episodes.<ref name="ICD-10">{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F30-F39|title=Mental and behavioural disorders: Mood [affective] disorders|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|date=2010|access-date=8 November 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102133725/http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F30-F39|archive-date=2 November 2014}}</ref> The latter system is typically used in European countries, while the former is used in the US and many other non-European nations,<ref>{{Harvnb |Sadock|2002|p=288}}</ref> and the authors of both have worked towards conforming one with the other.<ref name=APA372>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=xxix}}</ref>

Both DSM-5 and ICD-10 mark out typical (main) depressive symptoms.<ref name="DSMvsICD" /> ICD-10 defines three typical depressive symptoms (depressed mood, [[anhedonia]], and reduced energy), two of which should be present to determine the depressive disorder diagnosis.<ref name="DSM-10 diagnosis">{{cite web|title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines|url=https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf|date=2010|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|access-date=12 November 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323025330/http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf|archive-date=23 March 2014}}</ref><ref>The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioral disorders.

The category [[Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified|Unspecified Depressive Disorder]] is diagnosed if the depressive episode's manifestation does not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.<ref name=":1" /> The ICD-10 system does not use the term ''major depressive disorder'' but lists very similar criteria for the diagnosis of a depressive episode (mild, moderate or severe); the term ''recurrent'' may be added if there have been multiple episodes without [[mania]].<ref name="ICD-10" />

====Major depressive episode====
{{Main|Major depressive episode}}
[[File:A wretched man with an approaching depression; represented b Wellcome V0011145.jpg|thumb|left|Caricature of a man with depression]]
A major depressive episode is characterized by the presence of a severely depressed mood that persists for at least two weeks.<ref name=APA349 /> Episodes may be isolated or recurrent and are categorized as mild (few symptoms in excess of minimum criteria), moderate, or severe (marked impact on social or occupational functioning). An episode with psychotic features—commonly referred to as ''[[psychotic depression]]''—is automatically rated as severe.<ref name=":1" /> If the patient has had an episode of [[mania]] or [[hypomania|markedly elevated mood]], a diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]] is made instead. Depression without mania is sometimes referred to as ''unipolar'' because the mood remains at one emotional state or "pole".<ref>{{Harvnb |Parker|1996|p=173}}</ref>

[[DSM-IV TR|DSM-IV-TR]] excludes cases where the symptoms are a result of [[Grief|bereavement]], although it is possible for normal bereavement to evolve into a depressive episode if the mood persists and the characteristic features of a major depressive episode develop.<ref name=APA352>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=352}}</ref> The criteria were criticized because they do not take into account any other aspects of the personal and social context in which depression can occur.<ref name="Wakefield07">{{cite journal|vauthors=Wakefield JC, Schmitz MF, First MB, Horwitz AV|date=April 2007|title=Extending the bereavement exclusion for major depression to other losses: evidence from the National Comorbidity Survey|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=64|issue=4|pages=433–40|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.64.4.433|pmid=17404120|lay-source=The Washington Post|lay-date=3 April 2007|lay-url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/02/AR2007040201693.html|doi-access=free}}</ref> In addition, some studies have found little empirical support for the DSM-IV cut-off criteria, indicating they are a diagnostic convention imposed on a continuum of depressive symptoms of varying severity and duration.<ref name="Kendler98">{{cite journal|vauthors=Kendler KS, Gardner CO|date=February 1998|title=Boundaries of major depression: an evaluation of DSM-IV criteria|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=155|issue=2|pages=172–77|doi=10.1176/ajp.155.2.172|doi-broken-date=11 November 2020|pmid=9464194}}</ref> Bereavement is no longer an exclusion criterion in DSM-5, and it is now up to the clinician to distinguish between normal reactions to a loss and MDD.

====Subtypes====
The DSM-5 recognizes six further subtypes of MDD, called ''specifiers'', in addition to noting the length, severity and presence of psychotic features:
* "[[Melancholic depression]]" is characterized by [[anhedonia|a loss of pleasure in most or all activities]], a failure of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, a quality of depressed mood more pronounced than that of [[grief]] or loss, a worsening of symptoms in the morning hours, early-morning waking, [[psychomotor retardation]], excessive weight loss (not to be confused with [[anorexia nervosa]]), or excessive guilt.<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=419–20}}</ref>
* "[[Atypical depression]]" is characterized by mood reactivity (paradoxical anhedonia) and positivity, significant [[weight gain]] or increased appetite (comfort eating), excessive sleep or sleepiness ([[hypersomnia]]), a sensation of heaviness in limbs known as leaden paralysis, and significant social impairment as a consequence of hypersensitivity to perceived [[social rejection|interpersonal rejection]].<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=421–22}}</ref>
* "[[Catatonia|Catatonic]] depression" is a rare and severe form of major depression involving disturbances of motor behavior and other symptoms. Here, the person is mute and almost stuporous, and either remains immobile or exhibits purposeless or even bizarre movements. Catatonic symptoms also occur in [[schizophrenia]] or in manic episodes, or may be caused by [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=417–18}}</ref>
*"Depression with [[Anxiety|anxious]] distress" was added into the DSM-V as a means to emphasize the common co-occurrence between depression or [[mania]] and anxiety, as well as the risk of suicide of depressed individuals with anxiety. Specifying in such a way can also help with the prognosis of those diagnosed with a depressive or bipolar disorder.<ref name=":1" />
*"Depression with [[Postpartum depression|peri-partum]] onset" refers to the intense, sustained and sometimes disabling depression experienced by women after giving birth or while a woman is pregnant. DSM-IV-TR used the classification "postpartum depression," but this was changed in order to not exclude cases of depressed woman during pregnancy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5.|author=DSM-5 Task Force|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=9780890425541|oclc=1026055291|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse}}</ref> Depression with peripartum onset has an incidence rate of 10–15% among new mothers. The DSM-V mandates that, in order to qualify as depression with peripartum onset, onset occur during pregnancy or within one month of delivery. It has been said that postpartum depression can last as long as three months.<ref>{{cite web |author=Nonacs, Ruta M |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3408.htm |publisher=eMedicine |title=Postpartum depression |date=4 December 2007 |access-date=30 October 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013205912/http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3408.htm |archive-date=13 October 2008  }}</ref>
* "[[Seasonal affective disorder]]" (SAD) is a form of depression in which depressive episodes come on in the autumn or winter, and resolve in spring. The diagnosis is made if at least two episodes have occurred in colder months with none at other times, over a two-year period or longer.<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|p=425}}</ref>

===Differential diagnoses===
{{Main|Depression (differential diagnoses)}}

To confirm major depressive disorder as the most likely diagnosis, other [[Differential diagnosis|potential diagnoses]] must be considered, including dysthymia, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, or bipolar disorder. [[Dysthymia]] is a chronic, milder mood disturbance in which a person reports a low mood almost daily over a span of at least two years. The symptoms are not as severe as those for major depression, although people with dysthymia are vulnerable to secondary episodes of major depression (sometimes referred to as ''[[double depression]]'').<ref name="harvnb" /> [[Adjustment disorder|Adjustment disorder with depressed mood]] is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.<ref name="psychiatric355" /> [[Bipolar disorder]], also known as ''manic–depressive disorder'', is a condition in which depressive phases alternate with periods of [[mania]] or [[hypomania]]. Although depression is currently categorized as a separate disorder, there is ongoing debate because individuals diagnosed with major depression often experience some hypomanic symptoms, indicating a mood disorder continuum.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Akiskal HS, Benazzi F |title=The DSM-IV and ICD-10 categories of recurrent [major] depressive and bipolar II disorders: evidence that they lie on a dimensional spectrum |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=45–54 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16488021 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.035 }}</ref> Further differential diagnoses involve [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hawk C, Jason LA, Torres-Harding S |title=Differential diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome and major depressive disorder |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Medicine |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=244–51 |date=1 January 2006 |pmid=17078775 |doi=10.1207/s15327558ijbm1303_8 |citeseerx=10.1.1.574.3376 |s2cid=3604734 }}</ref>

Other disorders need to be ruled out before diagnosing major depressive disorder. They include depressions due to physical illness, [[medications]], and [[substance abuse]]. Depression due to physical illness is diagnosed as a [[Mood disorder#Due to another medical condition|mood disorder due to a general medical condition]]. This condition is determined based on history, laboratory findings, or [[physical examination]]. When the depression is caused by a medication, drug of abuse, or exposure to a [[toxin]], it is then diagnosed as a specific mood disorder (previously called ''substance-induced mood disorder'' in the DSM-IV-TR).<ref name="DSM5"/>

However, an earlier meta-analysis found preventive programs with a competence-enhancing component to be superior to behavior-oriented programs overall, and found behavioral programs to be particularly unhelpful for older people, for whom social support programs were uniquely beneficial. In addition, the programs that best prevented depression comprised more than eight sessions, each lasting between 60 and 90 minutes, were provided by a combination of lay and professional workers, had a high-quality research design, reported [[Churn rate|attrition rates]], and had a well-defined intervention.<ref>{{cite web |vauthors=Jané-Llopis E, Hosman C, Jenkins R, Anderson P |year=2003 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/183/5/384.pdf |title=Predictors of efficacy in depression prevention programmes |website=British Journal of Psychiatry |access-date=2 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326083702/http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/183/5/384.pdf |archive-date=26 March 2009 }}</ref>

The Netherlands mental health care system provides preventive interventions, such as the "Coping with Depression" course (CWD) for people with sub-threshold depression. The course is claimed to be the most successful of psychoeducational interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression (both for its adaptability to various populations and its results), with a risk reduction of 38% in major depression and an efficacy as a treatment comparing favorably to other psychotherapies.<ref name=Munoz2012 /><ref name=Cuijpers2009>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cuijpers P, Muñoz RF, Clarke GN, Lewinsohn PM |title=Psychoeducational treatment and prevention of depression: the "Coping with Depression" course thirty years later |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=449–58 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19450912 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2009.04.005 }}</ref>

==Management==
{{Main|Management of depression}}
The three most common treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice (over medication) for people under 18. The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression because the [[risk-benefit ratio]] is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressants treatment in combination with psychosocial interventions should be considered for:

:* People with a history of moderate or severe depression
:* Those with mild depression that has been present for a long period
:* As a second line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions
:* As a first line treatment for moderate or severe depression.

The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of [[relapse]], and that [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]] are better tolerated than [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG23 |access-date=20 March 2013 |title=Depression |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |date=December 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115042517/http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG23 |archive-date=15 November 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[American Psychiatric Association]] treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors including severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and patient preference. Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, exercise, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) or [[light therapy]]. Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all patients with severe depression unless ECT is planned.<ref name=apaguidelines/> There is evidence that collaborative care by a team of health care practitioners produces better results than routine single-practitioner care.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Archer J, Bower P, Gilbody S, Lovell K, Richards D, Gask L, Dickens C, Coventry P | title = Collaborative care for depression and anxiety problems | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | page = CD006525 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23076925 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006525.pub2 | hdl = 10871/13751 | hdl-access = free }}</ref>

Treatment options are much more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult. Development of mental health services is minimal in many countries; depression is viewed as a phenomenon of the developed world despite evidence to the contrary, and not as an inherently life-threatening condition.<ref name=Patel04>{{cite journal |vauthors=Patel V, Araya R, Bolton P |title=Treating depression in the developing world |journal=Tropical Medicine & International Health |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=539–41 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15117296 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2004.01243.x |s2cid=73073889 }}</ref> A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of psychological versus medical therapy in children.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cox GR, Callahan P, Churchill R, Hunot V, Merry SN, Parker AG, Hetrick SE |title=Psychological therapies versus antidepressant medication, alone and in combination for depression in children and adolescents |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=CD008324 |date=November 2014 |pmid=25433518 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008324.pub3 }}</ref>

The most-studied form of psychotherapy for depression is CBT, which teaches clients to challenge self-defeating, but enduring ways of thinking (cognitions) and change counter-productive behaviors.

To find the most effective antidepressant medication with minimal side-effects, the dosages can be adjusted, and if necessary, combinations of different classes of antidepressants can be tried. Response rates to the first antidepressant administered range from 50 to 75%, and it can take at least six to eight weeks from the start of medication to improvement.<ref name=apaguidelines /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Vries YA, Roest AM, Bos EH, Burgerhof JG, van Loo HM, de Jonge P | title = Predicting antidepressant response by monitoring early improvement of individual symptoms of depression: individual patient data meta-analysis | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 214 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–10 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 29952277 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.2018.122 | pmc = 7557872 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Antidepressant medication treatment is usually continued for 16 to 20 weeks after remission, to minimize the chance of recurrence,<!--This study is from 2000- is there not something more recent?--><ref name=apaguidelines>{{cite journal | title = Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (revision).

ECT appears to work in the short term via an [[anticonvulsant]] effect mostly in the [[frontal lobes]], and longer term via [[neurotrophic]] effects primarily in the [[medial temporal lobe]].<ref name=Abbott2014>{{cite journal |vauthors=Abbott CC, Gallegos P, Rediske N, Lemke NT, Quinn DK |title=A review of longitudinal electroconvulsive therapy: neuroimaging investigations |journal=Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=33–46 |date=March 2014 |pmid=24381234 |pmc=6624835 |doi=10.1177/0891988713516542 }}</ref>

===Transcranial direct current stimulation===
[[Transcranial direct current stimulation]] (tDCS) is another noninvasive method used to stimulate small regions of the brain with the help of a weak electric current. Increasing evidence has been gathered for its efficiency as a depression treatment. A meta-analysis was published in 2020 summarising results across nine studies (572 participants) concluded that active tDCS was significantly superior to sham for response (30.9% vs. 18.9%, respectively), remission (19.9% vs. 11.7%) and depression improvement.<ref name="Moffa 109836">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moffa AH, Martin D, Alonzo A, et al | title = Efficacy and acceptability of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for major depressive disorder: An individual patient data meta-analysis | journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry | volume = 99 | pages = 109836 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 31837388 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2019.109836 | s2cid = 209373871 }}</ref> According to a 2016 meta analysis,&nbsp;34% of tDCS-treated patients showed at least 50% symptom reduction compared to 19% sham-treated across 6 randomised controlled trials.<ref name="Brunoni 522–531">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunoni AR, Moffa AH, Fregni F, et al | title = Transcranial direct current stimulation for acute major depressive episodes: meta-analysis of individual patient data | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 208 | issue = 6 | pages = 522–31 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27056623 | pmc = 4887722 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.115.164715 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Light therapy===
Bright [[light therapy]] reduces depression symptom severity, with benefit for both [[seasonal affective disorder]] and for nonseasonal depression, and an effect similar to those for conventional antidepressants.

==History==
{{Main|History of depression}}

The Ancient Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] described a syndrome of melancholia as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms; he characterized all "fears and despondencies, if they last a long time" as being symptomatic of the ailment.<ref>Hippocrates, ''Aphorisms'', Section 6.23</ref> It was a similar but far broader concept than today's depression; prominence was given to a clustering of the symptoms of sadness, dejection, and despondency, and often fear, anger, delusions and obsessions were included.<ref name="Radden2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Radden J |year=2003 |title=Is this dame melancholy?

The term ''depression'' itself was derived from the Latin verb ''deprimere'', "to press down".<ref>depress. (n.d.). Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved 30 June 2008, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depress Dictionary.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203095346/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depress |date=3 December 2008 }}</ref> From the 14th century, "to depress" meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits. It was used in 1665 in English author [[Richard Baker (chronicler)|Richard Baker's]] ''Chronicle'' to refer to someone having "a great depression of spirit", and by English author [[Samuel Johnson's health|Samuel Johnson]] in a similar sense in 1753.<ref>{{cite web| vauthors = Wolpert L|year=1999|title=Malignant Sadness: The Anatomy of Depression|website=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolpert-sadness.html|access-date=30 October 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409111218/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wolpert-sadness.html|archive-date=9 April 2009}}</ref> The term also came into use in [[depression (physiology)|physiology]] and [[depression (economics)|economics]].

Although ''melancholia'' remained the dominant diagnostic term, ''depression'' gained increasing currency in medical treatises and was a synonym by the end of the century; German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] may have been the first to use it as the overarching term, referring to different kinds of melancholia as ''depressive states''.<ref name="Davison2006">{{cite journal |last=Davison |first=K|year=2006|title=Historical aspects of mood disorders |journal=Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=115–18 |doi=10.1383/psyt.2006.5.4.115}}</ref>

[[Sigmund Freud]] likened the state of melancholia to mourning in his 1917 paper ''Mourning and Melancholia''. He theorized that [[object (philosophy)|objective]] loss, such as the loss of a valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], [[narcissism|narcissistic]] process called the ''libidinal [[cathexis]]'' of the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]].

In the mid-20th century, researchers theorized that depression was caused by a [[chemical imbalance theory|chemical imbalance]] in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of [[reserpine]] and [[isoniazid]] in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schildkraut JJ |title=The catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders: a review of supporting evidence |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=122 |issue=5 |pages=509–22 |date=November 1965 |pmid=5319766 |doi=10.1176/ajp.122.5.509 }}</ref> The chemical imbalance theory has never been proven.<ref name="Paris2014">{{cite journal |vauthors=Paris J |title=The mistreatment of major depressive disorder |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=148–51 |date=March 2014 |pmid=24881163 |pmc=4079242 |doi=10.1177/070674371405900306 |type=Review }}</ref>

===Terminology===
[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-60 by Brady, 1862.jpg|thumb|The 16th [[President of the United States|American president]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] had "[[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]", a condition that now may be referred to as clinical depression.<ref>Wolf, Joshua [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200510/lincolns-clinical-depression "Lincoln's Great Depression"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009044732/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/lincoln-apos-s-great-depression/4247/ |date=9 October 2011 }}, ''The Atlantic'', October 2005, Retrieved 10 October 2009</ref>]]

The term "depression" is used in a number of different ways. It is often used to mean this syndrome but may refer to other [[mood disorder]]s or simply to a low mood. People's conceptualizations of depression vary widely, both within and among cultures. "Because of the lack of scientific certainty," one commentator has observed, "the debate over depression turns on questions of language. What we call it—'disease,' 'disorder,' 'state of mind'—affects how we view, diagnose, and treat it."<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2129377|title=The Depression Wars: Would Honest Abe Have Written the Gettysburg Address on Prozac?|author=Maloney F|date=3 November 2005|journal=Slate|access-date=3 October 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925012423/http://www.slate.com/id/2129377/|archive-date=25 September 2008}}</ref> There are cultural differences in the extent to which serious depression is considered an illness requiring personal professional treatment, or is an indicator of something else, such as the need to address social or moral problems, the result of biological imbalances, or a reflection of individual differences in the understanding of distress that may reinforce feelings of powerlessness, and emotional struggle.<ref name="Karasz05">{{cite journal |vauthors=Karasz A |title=Cultural differences in conceptual models of depression |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=1625–35 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15652693 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.08.011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Tilbury F, Rapley M | year = 2004 | title = 'There are orphans in Africa still looking for my hands': African women refugees and the sources of emotional distress|journal=Health Sociology Review|volume=13|issue=1|pages=54–64|doi=10.5172/hesr.13.1.54| s2cid = 145545714 }}</ref>

The diagnosis is less common in some countries, such as China.

===Stigma===
Historical figures were often reluctant to discuss or seek treatment for depression due to [[social stigma]] about the condition, or due to ignorance of diagnosis or treatments.

Social stigma of major depression is widespread, and contact with mental health services reduces this only slightly.

As with many other diseases, it is common among the elderly not to present with classical depressive symptoms.<ref name="SBU" /> Diagnosis and treatment is further complicated in that the elderly are often simultaneously treated with a number of other drugs, and often have other concurrent diseases.<ref name="SBU" /> Treatment differs in that studies of SSRIs have shown lesser and often inadequate effects among the elderly, while other drugs, such as [[duloxetine]] (a [[Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]), with more clear effects have adverse effects, such as dizziness, dryness of the mouth, diarrhea and constipation, which can be especially difficult to handle among the elderly.<ref name="SBU" />

[[Problem solving therapy]] was, as of 2015, the only psychological therapy with proven effect, and can be likened to a simpler form of cognitive behavioral therapy.<ref name="SBU" /> However, elderly with depression are seldom offered any psychological treatment, and the evidence proving other treatments effective is incomplete.<ref name="SBU" /> ECT has been used in the elderly, and register-studies suggest it is effective, although less so as compared to the rest of the population. The risks involved with treatment of depression among the elderly as opposed to benefits are not entirely clear.<ref name="SBU" />

==Research==
[[MRI]] scans of patients with depression have revealed a number of differences in brain structure compared to those who are not depressed. Meta-analyses of [[neuroimaging]] studies in major depression reported that, compared to controls, depressed patients had increased volume of the [[lateral ventricles]] and [[adrenal gland]] and smaller volumes of the [[basal ganglia]], [[thalamus]], [[hippocampus]], and [[frontal lobe]] (including the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and [[gyrus rectus]]).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kempton MJ, Salvador Z, Munafò MR, Geddes JR, Simmons A, Frangou S, Williams SC |title=Structural neuroimaging studies in major depressive disorder.

Trials are looking at the effects of [[botulinum toxin]]s on depression.

===Animals models===
{{further|Animal models of depression|animal psychopathology#Depression}}
Models of depression in animals for the purpose of study include [[iatrogenic]] depression models (such as drug-induced), forced swim tests, [[tail suspension test]], and [[learned helplessness]] models. Criteria frequently used to assess depression in animals include expression of despair, neurovegetative changes, and anhedonia, as many other criteria for depression are untestable in animals, such as guilt and suicidality.<ref>{{Cite book|vauthors=Krishnan V, Nestler EJ |volume=7 |pages=121–47 |date=2011 |pmid=21225412 |pmc=3270071 |doi=10.1007/7854_2010_108 |isbn=978-3-642-19702-4 |series=Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences |title=Molecular and Functional Models in Neuropsychiatry |chapter=Animal Models of Depression: Molecular Perspectives }}</ref>
