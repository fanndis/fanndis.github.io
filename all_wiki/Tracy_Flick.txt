'''Tracy Enid Flick''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] who is the subject of the 1998 novel ''[[Election (1998 novel)|Election]]'' by [[Tom Perrotta]] and portrayed by [[Reese Witherspoon]] in the 1999 [[Election (1999 film)|film adaptation of the same title]]. She is a smart, ambitious [[high school]] student whose quest to win a school election is nearly derailed by her teacher.

Witherspoon's performance as Tracy was widely acclaimed by critics and garnered her multiple awards and nominations, including a [[Golden Globe]] nod. The character has since become an icon, as her driven, focused personality and unpopularity among her peers have led to comparisons with many real-life public figures, particularly female politicians such as [[Hillary Clinton]].

==Overview==
Tracy is an ambitious high school [[Junior (education)|junior]], preparing for an easy election to the office of [[Student governments in the United States|student body president]] after three years of extracurricular toil. Her assumption that she will be unopposed is dashed when two challengers enter the race: friendly and popular athlete Paul Metzler, sidelined from the football team by a skiing accident, and Paul's younger adopted sister Tammy, a moody, sarcastic rebel. Paul has been coaxed into running by election supervisor Jim McAllister, a civics teacher nursing a deep resentment toward Tracy since her [[affair]] with Jim's best friend and fellow teacher resulted in the man losing his job.

As the race continues and Paul's effortless popularity continues to jeopardize Tracy's once sure victory, Tracy's frustration drives her to commit an act of sabotage against his campaign, ripping down his posters right before election day. Despite Jim's conviction of her guilt, she escapes punishment again through a stroke of pure luck when Tammy claims responsibility for the crime and is subsequently expelled, which was her objective in "confessing." Tracy wins the election despite Jim's attempt at sabotage, and goes on to attend [[Georgetown University]], her dream school. She is later seen in Washington, D.C., working closely alongside a Republican congressman from Nebraska.

==Film adaptation of ''Election''==

In the late 1990s, following her starring roles in the 1996 dramas ''[[Fear (1996 film)|Fear]]'' and ''[[Freeway (1996 film)|Freeway]]'', Witherspoon found herself in an unexpected career slump that led her to change direction. "All my serious dramatic performances suddenly weren't getting me the jobs or opportunities that I really wanted," she said in a 2005 interview. "I have stacks and stacks of letters from great directors saying I can't cast you because you don't mean anything to the studios. That's why I turned the boat toward comedy."<ref name="booth">{{cite news|last1=Booth|first1=William|title=Playing It Straight|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111100442.html|accessdate=23 February 2017|work=Washington Post|date=13 November 2005}}</ref>

''Election''{{'}}s director [[Alexander Payne]] was eager to cast Witherspoon, based on her performances in ''[[Freeway (1996 film)|Freeway]]'' and ''[[The Man in the Moon]]'', and she was equally eager to sign on to the project—but not to play Tracy.<ref name="cheng">{{cite news|last1=Cheng|first1=Scarlet|title=Acting on Dual Intentions|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/apr/11/entertainment/ca-26137|accessdate=23 February 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=11 April 1999}}</ref> Witherspoon was drawn to the part of Tammy Metzler, the cynical outcast who becomes the election's [[dark horse]] presidential candidate. Referring to the scene in which Tammy delivers a shocking campaign speech denouncing the school's administration and the entire concept of elected student government, Witherspoon said, "That speech alone made me want to play Tammy! So I was terribly conflicted."<ref name="cheng"/>

To play Tracy, Witherspoon developed a distinct speech pattern combining strident intonations with a chipper Midwestern accent. She also worked on clenching her facial muscles and maintaining a clipped walking pace. "That was just Tracy; it so escapes me how it came out!" she said. "I just imagined how uptight people carry themselves, and they grind their teeth at night and they clench their jaw because everything has to be just perfect."<ref name="cheng"/> Of Witherspoon's performance, her co-star Matthew Broderick said, "From the first she knew exactly what she wanted—a very aggressive person in a small and cute package... she comes out very funny and very scary at the same time."<ref name="cheng"/>

Witherspoon's performance received widespread critical acclaim, as well as her first [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination and several other accolades.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|title=Talent behind Witherspoon's win|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/entertainment/4581664.stm|accessdate=23 February 2017|work=BBC News|date=17 January 2006}}</ref> But she later said that her career struggles continued after ''Election'' due to public confusion between her and Tracy. "I'm not Tracy Flick. I couldn't get jobs for a year after that because people thought I was that crazy and angry and controlling and strange."<ref name="booth"/>

[[Roger Ebert]] began his review of ''Election'', "I remember students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has her hand in the air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. In fact, I was a student like Tracy Flick." He goes on to compare Tracy to [[Elizabeth Dole]]: "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to [[David Merrick]]: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Election|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990430/REVIEWS/904300302/1023|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>

{{Trivia|date=May 2019}}
A 2006 profile of the character in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called her "wonderfully monstrous." "In Payne's study of her pathologies, Tracy's will is so fiery and her perfection so total that no one dares stand against her in her goal."<ref>{{cite news|title=Tracy Flick|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/03/AR2006110300287_pf.html|accessdate=23 February 2017|work=Washington Post|date=5 November 2006}}</ref> ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' wrote, "Like [[Humbert Humbert]], the [[Reverend Harry Powell]], and [[Baby Jane Hudson]] before her, Tracy Flick is a real and lasting contribution to the cinematic understanding of the villain, and the feather in Witherspoon's cap."<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Shilling|title=Blonde and Brilliant|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=7999|work=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]|publisher=Index Newspapers, LLC|location=Seattle, Washington|date=July 12, 2001|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}</ref>

Tracy has often been a point of comparison in commentary on real-world political figures. [[Hillary Clinton]] has more than once been compared to her.<ref>{{cite news|first=Amy|last=Chozick|title=My Eight Months With the Obama Campaign|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122609729937709673?mod=googlewsj|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|location=New York City|date=November 7, 2008|accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Frank|last=Rich|authorlink=Frank Rich|title=The Audacity of Hopelessness|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/opinion/24rich.html?ref=opinion|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 24, 2008|accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref> In a January 2008 [[mashup (video)|video mashup]] produced by ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', campaign footage of Clinton was combined with clips from ''Election'' to draw a comparison between Clinton's and Tracy's feelings about the inferiority of their opponents.

A ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' review of Clinton's 2003 autobiography, ''[[Living History (book)|Living History]]'', quoted an excerpt in which Clinton discussed her participation during high school in a Cultural Values Committee and noted, "There is obviously some truth here, but the tone of the passage reeks of Tracy Flick, the overachieving, overly serious high school student from the film ''Election''. Not to belittle the efforts of the Cultural Values Committee, but a brief aside to show that Clinton understands that high school sociopolitics is not exactly on par with race relations would be nice."<ref>{{cite news|first=Dante|last=Chinni|title=The importance of being earnest|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0612/p15s01-bogn.html|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|publisher=[[Christian Science Publishing Society]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=June 12, 2003|accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref>
