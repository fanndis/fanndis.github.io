The '''Oneida Indian Nation''' (OIN) or '''Oneida Nation''' is a [[federally recognized tribe]] of [[Oneida people]] in the United States. The tribe is headquartered in [[New York (state)|New York]], where the tribe originated and held its historic territory long before European colonialism. It is an Iroquoian-speaking people, and one of the [[Iroquois|Five Nations]] of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], or ''Haudenosaunee''. Three other federally recognized Oneida tribes operate in locations where they migrated and were [[Indian removal|removed]] to during and after the [[American Revolutionary War]]: one in [[Oneida Nation of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] in the United States, and two in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].

Today the Oneida Indian Nation owns tribal land in [[Verona, New York|Verona]], [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]], and [[Canastota, New York]], on which it operates a number of businesses. These include a resort with a Class III gambling casino.

Since the late 20th century, the OIN has been a party to [[Indian Land Claims Settlements|land claim suits]] against the state of New York for treaties and purchases it made after the [[American Revolutionary War]] without ratification by the [[United States Senate]], as required under the [[US Constitution]]. Litigation has been complex, related to trust lands, Class III gaming, property, and sales tax collection. The [[Oneida Indian Nation#2013 landmark agreement between New York State, Madison and Oneida Counties, and the OIN|landmark agreement]] entered into on May 16, 2013 between Madison and Oneida Counties, the OIN, and the state resolved these issues.

==Government==
The tribe is headquartered in [[Verona, New York]], and the Nation Representative is [[Ray Halbritter]].<ref>[http://www.ncai.org/tribal-directory?letter=O "Tribal Directory"], ''National Congress of American Indians.''

===Treaties===
In addition to being a member of the nation of the 1794 Treaty of Canadaigua,<ref>[http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TreatyWithTheSixNations1794.pdf Treaty with the Six Nations, 1794]</ref> the OIN is a member of the following treaties:
*Treaty of Amity Commerce and Navigation; known as the Jay Treaty<ref>[http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TreatyOfAmityCommerceAndNavigation.pdf Jay Treaty]</ref>
*Treaty with the Six Nations, 1784; known as the Veterans Treaty<ref>[http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TreatyWithTheSixNations1784.pdf Veterans Treaty]</ref>

==Membership==
The tribal council of the OIN has established the rules for citizenship: it requires documentation of at least 1/4 blood ancestry (equivalent to one grandparent) through the maternal line.<ref>[http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Oneida-Nation-Fact-Sheet-for-Web-2017.pdf OIN Fact Sheet]</ref> The OIN and other Iroquois nations have had a [[matrilineal]] [[kinship system]], with descent and inheritance through the mother's line.

== Clans ==
The OIN consists of three clans: Turtle, Wolf, and Bear.<ref name="ibid jan 2019">{{ibid|date=January 2019}}</ref> Each Nation member belongs to one of these clans. A child is considered born into the mother's clan, and takes social status from her people.<ref name="ibid jan 2019" />

=== Creation ===
Legend has it that clan names and the matrilineal kinship system came from a response to issues that arose during the [[Haudenosaunee]] mourning process. Prior to clans being created, the entire Oneida village would mourn after the death of a village member. This caused problems as important decisions were put on hold during the time of mourning. Village leaders were at a loss as to how to continue everyday life while at the same time observing traditional mourning practices. A young village member approached the leaders with a possible solution.  He suggested sending three female elders to the nearby river, having them build a fire, and spend the night. At first light the following morning the women were to pray to the Creator and take notice of the first animal that approached the river. Once the women had seen an animal, they were to report back to the village leaders. The elders put the young man’s plan into action. Three women were sent to the river. Upon their return one woman reported that she had seen a turtle at the edge of the river. The second woman reported seeing a wolf running along the river. The third woman stated that she had seen a bear feeding in the river along the rocks. Following the reports of the women, village leaders named the Oneida clans the Turtle, Wolf and Bear clans. They determined that a village member’s clan would be passed through the mother's line from generation to generation, as women have the Creator’s gift to create life.  The Oneida Nation is still a matrilineal kinship society. After the clans were established, the people developed their practices for a mourning process. When there was a death in the village, the clan members of that person would mourn. The members of a second clan would console them, and the members of the third clan would carry on village business as usual.<ref>[http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/how-the-clans-were-chosen/ Clan creation legend]</ref>

=== Meaning ===
The Haudenosaunee people are made up of several Nations. Among these nations are kinship groups called clans.  While Nation members have their immediate family of parents and siblings, they also have an extended family of fellow Clan members.  As a matrilineal society, each clan member is born into their clan by their mother. The three Oneida Nation clans are named after animals, the turtle, wolf, and bear.  Each animal is considered to have certain positive characteristics or attributes.  The turtle teaches patience, as well as the importance of never giving up. Turtles are also seen to be representative of strength and solidarity. They are thought to be old and wise, and are well respected. The wolf teaches the importance of using your ears, listening and being watchful. They embody a strong sense of family. Finally, the bear is seen as gentle and strong. Bears are seen as having strength in knowing that takes more strength not to raise your hand and strike, than to give into the impulse to strike.<ref>[https://oneida-nsn.gov/our-ways/our-story/clan-systems/ Clan animal meanings]; [http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/the-haudenosaunee-creation-story/ Haudenosaunee creation legend],</ref><!--Not sure if this is sufficient, but best I could find{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}--><!--It may be legend, but this version is likely written somewhere-->

==Businesses==
The tribe set up '''Oneida Nation Enterprises''', through which it operates a number of businesses in [[Central New York]]. As of 2013, it was the largest employer of the area, with approximately 5,000 jobs total.<ref>[http://www.onenterprises.com/ Oneida Nation Enterprises website.] Accessed: September 3, 2013.</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Theresa|last1=Vargas|first2=Annys|last2=Shin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113035321/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/oneida-indian-nation-is-the-tiny-tribe-taking-on-the-nfl-and-dan-snyder-over-redskins-name/2013/11/16/10ef9290-4c88-11e3-be6b-d3d28122e6d4_story.html|archivedate=January 13, 2016|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/oneida-indian-nation-is-the-tiny-tribe-taking-on-the-nfl-and-dan-snyder-over-redskins-name/2013/11/16/10ef9290-4c88-11e3-be6b-d3d28122e6d4_story.html|title=Oneida Indian Nation is the tiny tribe taking on the NFL and Dan Snyder over Redskins name|date=November 16, 2013|work=Local|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=January 10, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Business interests include:

===Bingo and gasoline===
In the early 1990s, the OIN opened a [[Bingo (US)|bingo]] hall. [[Arthur Raymond Halbritter|Ray Halbritter]] (Oneida), opened a gas station known as '''SavOn''' across the street. The cheaper gasoline <!-- Why cheaper? Compared to what? -->made the gas station popular among the community.

Eventually the OIN bought SavOn and expanded it into multiple locations within the area. Today ''SavOn'' (or ''SāvOn'') is a chain of gas stations and convenience stores in [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida]] and [[Madison County, New York|Madison]] counties, owned and operated by the Oneida Indian Nation.

===Casinos and resorts===
The OIN opened several casinos.  The first was the Turning Stone Casino & Resort, in 1993.  After the 2013 landmark settlement, the OIN opened the Yellow Brick Road Casino in June 2015.  And on March 3, 2018, OIN opened the Point Place Casino in Bridgeport, NY.<ref>[https://www.oneidaindiannation.com/enterprises OIN Enterprises]</ref>

====Turning Stone Resort Casino====
{{Main|Turning Stone Resort & Casino}}
The tribe's most profitable business is the [[Turning Stone Resort & Casino]], which has been expanding continuously since its opening in 1993.  The current game-space is approximately {{convert|100000|ft2|m2}}. Begun as a bingo hall, it has been developed as a large, Class III gaming facility and resort.<ref>Class III gaming is the broadest class of gambling under the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA).</ref> The entertainment site includes nationally ranked hotels and restaurants. Many shows are performed throughout the year. The resort is the host for a fall [[Professional Golfers' Association of America|Professional Golfers' Association]] (PGA) tournament.
Some parties have challenged the tribal-state gaming compact between the OIN and New York state.  The 2013 agreement between the OIN, Madison and Oneida Counties, and New York resolved all challenges to the casino.

In 2016, the casino and resort underwent a $20 million upgrade and renovation project to provide better smoke-free areas on the gambling floor, improve ventilation facilities, add a cafeteria, and add/upgrade rooms.<ref>[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/11/turning_stone_to_limit_smokers_to_own_mini-casino_20_million_project_to_upgrade.html Turning Stone To Limit Smokers To Own Mini-Casino]</ref>

<!-- linked from redirect [[Yellow Brick Road Casino]] -->
In June 2015, the OIN opened a casino based on themes from the popular book and film, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', indirectly honoring writer [[L.

===Other business ventures===
The OIN has purchased a [[marina]] on the south-eastern shore of [[Oneida Lake]] and many plots of land in the area.

The [[Indian Country Media Network]] (ICMN) was owned by the Oneida Nation of New York until 2017; it included the ''Indian Country Today'' online newspaper. That year the OIN donated the news organization's assets to the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/native-news/oneida-nation-donate-indian-country-today-media-network-assets-ncai/|title=Oneida Nation to Donate Indian Country Today Media Network Assets to NCAI|last=|first=|date=2017-10-04|website=Indian Country Media Network|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-20}}</ref> The NCAI has continued to publish ''Indian Country Today'' online.

==OIN land litigation==
Since the 1970s, the OIN have been involved in several lawsuits involving real property.  In the 70s, the OIN filed suit seeking recovery of the original land grant contained in the 1794 Treaty of Canadaigua arguing the land was improperly transferred in violation of federal law and the US Constitution.  As time progressed, the OIN began purchasing real property within this original grant as it became available.  The OIN asserted its limited sovereignty status to claim the properties exempt from county and state property taxes.  This culminated in several additional suits preceding the 2013 landmark agreement.

===Land claim===
{{main|Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State v. Oneida County|Oneida County v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State|City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y.}}

In 1970 and 1974, the OIN, [[Oneida Nation of Wisconsin]] and the [[Oneida Nation of the Thames]] (Canada) filed lawsuits in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]]; they alleged that the reservation land granted to them by a treaty between the OIN and New York State was taken from the Oneida people (from their historic territory) and the treaty was never ratified by the Senate, making it unconstitutional. The state did not have authority under the US Constitution to deal directly with the Indian nations. The Oneida said that they still legally owned the lands in question.

In 1970, the OIN filed a "test" case in federal court, suing Oneida and Madison counties for two years' rent (1968-1969) on county-owned acreage; the rent amounted to $16,694. The OIN argue that as the original action by the state was unconstitutional, they still owned the land and were owed rent by the counties. The [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] dismissed the action, and the OIN appealed. On July 12, 1972, the Second Circuit United States Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s decision.<ref>464 F2d 916</ref> The OIN petitioned the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to grant ''[[certiorari]]''  In ''[[Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida]]'' (1974), the Supreme Court decided in favor of the Oneida Indian Nation.<ref>414 US 661 [1974]</ref>

On July 12, 1977, on [[remand (court procedure)|remand]] to the District Court with Judge Edmund Port presiding, the Court sided with the OIN. The counties appealed to the Second Circuit, which affirmed Judge Port's decision. The counties had argued the OIN did not have standing for its claim, and the claim was too old and should not be considered.<ref>719 F2d 525 [1983]</ref> The counties petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of ''cert.'', which the court granted.

On March 4, 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court found in favor of the OIN in a 5 to 4 vote.<ref>''County of Oneida v Oneida Indian Nation'', 470 US 226 (1985)</ref> The Court opined on three principles:
* that the OIN had a common-law right to sue in federal courts;
* that such claims were justiciable; and
* there was no state or federal statute of limitations that would bar such claims. The majority opinion includes the following footnote:
<blockquote>"The question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to the present day Oneida Indians was not addressed by the Court of Appeals or presented to this Court by petitioners. Accordingly, we express no opinion as to whether other considerations may be relevant to the final disposition of this case should Congress not exercise its authority to resolve these far-reaching Indian claims."</blockquote>

Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] wrote in his dissent: 
<blockquote>"This decision upsets long-settled expectations in the ownership of real property in the Counties of Oneida and Madison, New York, and the disruption it is sure to cause will confirm the common law wisdom that ancient claims are best left in repose. The Court, no doubt, believes that it is undoing a grave historical injustice, but in so doing it has caused another, which only Congress may now rectify."</blockquote>

In 1998, the [[United States]] Department of Justice intervened in the lawsuits on the plaintiff's behalf in order for the claim to proceed against New York State because the state asserted its immunity under the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|11th Amendment]].<ref>[http://www.madisoncounty.org/motf/fed128.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112004911/http://www.madisoncounty.org/motf/fed128.html |date=November 12, 2006 }}</ref>  Based on ''[[City of Sherrill v.

Both parties appealed Judge Kahn's decision. In a decision dated August 9, 2010, the Second Circuit opined that the non-possessory claims could not proceed and remanded the case back to the district court to enter a judgement in favor of the State and Counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upstate-citizens.org/07-2430-cv_opn.pdf|title=Second Circuit decision|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref>  The OIN appealed to the US Supreme Court.<ref>[http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1652682626/Halbritter-Oneidas-to-appeal-claim-ruling-to-U-S-Supreme-Court "Oneidas to Appeal Claim Decision"], Upstate Citizens for Equality</ref>

===Status of former tribal lands re-acquired on the open market===
[[File:US Navy 061104-N-0000P-003 Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman, Navy Adm. Edmund Giambastiani speaks with attendees of the Oneida Indian Nation veterans recognition ceremony in Verona, N.Y.jpg|thumb|Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman, Navy Adm. [[Edmund Giambastiani]] speaks with attendees of the Oneida Indian Nation veterans recognition ceremony in Verona, N.Y, November 4, 2006]]

The OIN has purchased lands which had been part of its historic reservation, as established by treaty with New York State. These had later been sold to the state and subsequently to non-Indians. For some time, the OIN and the state believed that the OIN's purchase of the land restored the property to its status as Indian Territory under Oneida possession.

State law prohibits Class III gaming facilities. The OIN developed its resort and casino on what was understood to be its federal reservation, where that action was authorized under tribal sovereignty.

The city of Sherrill challenged the OIN by trying to collect property taxes on the land the tribe bought in that jurisdiction, where it developed its casino. In ''[[City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation]]'', US Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] determined that the land the casino is on was part of the original tribal lands.<ref name="Sherill" group="Sherill">544 US 197 [2005]</ref> But, Justice Ginsburg held that although the land may be part of an ancient reservation land grant, as the OIN had not controlled it for more than 200 years, during which time it was non-Indian territory, the tribe could not re-establish its immunity (from state law) over those lands.<ref name="Sherill"/>

To "re-establish sovereign authority" over ancient tribal lands which the Oneida had re-acquired on the open market, the U.S. Supreme Court said that the "proper avenue" for the Oneida Indian Nation was through § 465 of the [[Indian Reorganization Act]]. The OIN needed to apply to the Department of the Interior to place the disputed lands into federal trust.<ref group="Sherill">544 US 197, 217-221 [2005]</ref>

Comments on the court decision varied. The issue in ''Sherrill'' was whether the city could levy property taxes on OIN's re-acquired tribal lands. The US Supreme Court determined that the City of Sherrill could levy property taxes. But the court failed to overturn the Second Circuit's finding that the land qualified as Indian Territory.

OIN supporters argue that ''Sherrill'' stands only to say that the OIN cannot re-instate its tax immunity, but that the land is Indian Land. [[Upstate_Citizens_for_Equality|UCE]] and its supporters disagreed; they counter that the ''Sherrill'' ruling provided a blanket approval for the jurisdictions to foreclose on all OIN property that owe back taxes. Some UCE members interpreted the ruling as making the OIN casino operation illegal under state law, and speculated that it should be closed until the state and the OIN reach a new agreement on gaming.

===Land trust application===

In April 2005, the OIN applied to the Department of Interior to have this land taken into federal trust on its behalf.  By letter dated June 10, 2005, Associate Deputy Secretary Cason advised [[Ray Halbritter]], the tribe's lead on this issue, of its position:
<blockquote>"Department of Interior’s ("DOI") position with respect to certain issues related to the status of OIN lands ... we do not agree with [the] assertion that the Court’s ruling in Sherrill recognizes the continuation of restriction on alienation protections over recently re-acquired lands ... it is our opinion that Court in ''City of Sherrill'' unmistakably held that the lands at issue (property interests purchased by OIN on the open market) are subject to real property taxes. In the event these taxes are not paid, we believe such lands are subject to foreclosure. Further, please be advised that the BIA is in the process of taking appropriate action to clarify that its recordation of OIN deeds does not have the legal effect of designating these lands as restricted against alienation pursuant to 25 USC 177."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upstate-citizens.org/Exhibit-C-10-JUN-05-Letter-of-James-E-Cason.pdf|title=James E. Cason Letter, June 10, 2005|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

In order to accept the lands as federal trust property, the BIA had to prepare an [[environmental assessment]] of the action. On February 27, 2008, the BIA released its Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on taking the lands in question into trust on behalf of the OIN. It recommended that {{convert|13084|acre|mi2+km2}} be placed into trust. After this announcement, the DOI gave a 30-day comment period and announced that it would have a decision on or after March 25, 2008.<ref>[http://www.oneidanationtrust.com/ Final Environmental Impact Statement], Oneida Nation Trust</ref>

Some government officials expressed concern about creating a "patchwork of taxable and tax-exempt properties," making a "jurisdictional nightmare."

In opposing the OIN's land-into-trust application, New York State raised the question of whether the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] (IRA) applies to the OIN, as the OIN had rejected reorganizing according to its rules, by a vote of 12 to 57 on June 17, 1936.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/legal_protection_pdf/platkin.pdf|title=Letter from Richard Platkin, Counsel to the Governor, to Franklin Keel, Regional Director, Eastern Regional Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref> According to the letter from Richard Platkin, Counsel to the Governor, to Franklin Keel, citing Michael T.

The OIN have noted that, as early as 1910, they have been a federally recognized tribe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/microfilm/m595.pdf |title=Archival roll of Indian Census Rolls, 1850-1940 |date= |accessdate=2014-10-09}}, pg 16</ref>  The OIN is part of the original Oneida tribe that was party to the [[Treaty of Canandaigua|1794 Treaty of Canadaigua]]. In unrelated cases involving other Indian tribes and whether the IRA applied to them, the BIA issued a ruling that the fact that a tribe conducted a vote related to reorganizing under the IRA, was sufficient to establish that an Indian Tribe was under federal jurisdiction in 1934.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doi.gov/solicitor/opinions/M-37029.pdf |title=M37029 The meaning of "under federal jurisdiction" for purposes of the Indian Reorganization Act |accessdate=2014-10-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520213314/http://www.doi.gov/solicitor/opinions/M-37029.pdf |archive-date=2014-05-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  A 1980 BIA memorandum determined that the phrase "recognized tribe now under federal jurisdiction" includes tribes that existed in 1934 and had a continuing course of dealing with the United States or some other legal obligation.<ref name="ibid jan 2019" />  To this day, the United States honors its legal obligations to the OIN under the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oneidanation.org/uploadedFiles/Departments/Cultural_Heritage/Sub_Pages/09.10.19%20Treaty%20of%201794%20and%20Annuities%20New%20Format.pdf |title=Treaty of Canadaigua and the Oneida Annuity Payments |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2014-10-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924060353/http://www.oneidanation.org/uploadedFiles/Departments/Cultural_Heritage/Sub_Pages/09.10.19%20Treaty%20of%201794%20and%20Annuities%20New%20Format.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Any flawed claim that the OIN is not a federally recognized tribe was unequivocally debunked in the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in 2016, where the Court affirmed, inter alia, that the OIN is an Indian Tribe within the meaning of the IRA.<ref>''Upstate Citizens for Equality v.

On December 23, 2013, the BIA issued an amendment to its 2008 record of decision, accepting 13,082 acres into federal trust.  In that amendment, the BIA unequivocally determined that the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 is applicable to the OIN not only by virtue of the vote held, but also by the ''Boylan'' litigation, the 1794 Treaty of Canadaigua, and the historical record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/344-interior-rod-amendment.pdf |title=Notice Of Filing Of Amendment To The May 20, 2008 Record Of Decision For Oneida Indian Nation Of New York Fee-To-Trust Request |date=2014-02-05 |accessdate=2014-10-09}}</ref>  As noted below, New York State, and Oneida and Madison Counties have agreed to this decision's validity and discontinued any legal challenge, in perpetuity.

On January 2008, Halbritter sent a proposed settlement offer to the state and the county, but did not receive a response before DOI announced its decision. The OIN offered to negotiate an agreement pertaining to future trust applications, but the state and local governments have not responded.<ref name="ibid jan 2019" />

On May 20, 2008, the DOI announced that it would take {{convert|13004|acre|mi2+km2}} into trust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oneidanationtrust.com/downloadfiles/ROD/Final%20Oneida%20ROD%2005-20-08%20(2).pdf|title=DOI Decision|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The OIN offered to negotiate and settle the issues involved, while the state and county officials promised continued litigation.

On or about June 17, 2008, two groups filed separate lawsuits in federal court challenging the DOI's decision.;<ref>[http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1824230392/2-suits-filed-opposing-land-into-trust "2 Suits Filed Opposing Land Into Trust Decision"], UCE</ref><ref>[http://www.upstate-citizens.org/UCE-v-United-States.htm Article re: suit], UCE</ref><ref>[http://www.upstate-citizens.org/USDC-UCE-v-US.htm Copy of complaint: ''UCE, et al. v.

As detailed below, on May 16, 2013, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]], Oneida County Executive [[Anthony Picente]], Madison County Board of Supervisors Chairman John Becker, and Oneida Indian Nation leader [[Ray Halbritter]] announced a deal that settled all of their differences.  Before the deal became effective, the majority of each government's legislative branches had to approve it.<ref>[http://www.uticaod.com/features/x90717556/Oneidas-reach-revenue-sharing-deal-with-state-counties?zc_p=0 "Oneidas, State, and counties reach a revenue sharing deal"], ''Utica OD''</ref><ref name="OIN and Cuomo">[http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/05162013-agreement-with-state-oneida-nation-and-oneida-and-madison-counties Cuomo Announces Landmark Agreement between State, Oneida Nation, and Oneida and Madison Counties"], ''Governor of New York''</ref>  The key components of the agreement are as follows: 
# The OIN will pay 25% of its profits from its new slot machines to the state; 
# The State agrees to allow a maximum of {{convert|25,000|acre|mi2+km2}} to be placed into federal trust; 
# The OIN will have exclusive gaming rights within a 10-county region;
# All pending litigation will be withdrawn; and 
# The OIN will charge its own sales tax on cigarettes and gas sales made to non-Indian purchasers, to be paid to the state. Of the 25% revenue that the state will receive, it will give half to the governments of Oneida and Madison counties.

{{main|Washington Redskins name controversy}}
In 2013, the OIN renewed a campaign to compel the Washington Redskins to change their team name and mascot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/oneida-indian-nation-is-the-tiny-tribe-taking-on-the-nfl-and-dan-snyder-over-redskins-name/2013/11/16/10ef9290-4c88-11e3-be6b-d3d28122e6d4_story.html|title=Oneida Indian Nation is the tiny tribe taking on the NFL and Dan Snyder over Redskins name|work=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref> The OIN leader Halbritter launched the website "Change the Mascot."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.changethemascot.org/|title=Change The Mascot - Launched By The Oneida Indian Nation|website=ChangeTheMascot.org|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref> On July 13, 2020, the Washington Redskins team ceded to public pressure and announced its decision to retire the team logo and change its name.<ref>[https://www.foxnews.com/sports/washington-redskins-retire-team-name Washington Resdkins retire team name]</ref>

== Issues ==
The OIN has both internal and external opposition. Internally, members of the Wolf Clan in particular protest Halbritter's assumption of power and dissolving of the traditional Oneida government, which was based on hereditary leaders for life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oneidasfordemocracy.org/|title=Detroit Car Accident Law Firm - Best Auto Accident Attorneys in Michigan|website=oneidasfordemocracy.org|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref>

=== Internal governance issues ===
''Shenandoah v. United States DOI'' was a lawsuit that challenged the legitimacy and authority of Ray Halbritter to act on behalf of the OIN.<ref name=WolfClan/>  Specifically,

<blockquote>"In 1977, members of the Oneida Nation appointed Halbritter and two other Nation members as interim representatives of the Nation. On April 25, 1993, the Grand Council, consisting of representatives from all six Iroquois nations, including the Oneida Nation, purported to remove Halbritter from his position as interim Nation representative. The Department [of Interior] acknowledged the removal on August 10, 1993, but the next day stayed its acknowledgment pending BIA review. After requesting the Nation to conduct a referendum to select a representative, the Department agreed to Halbritter's proposal to submit "statements of support" from Nation members. On February 4, 1994, the Department notified Halbritter that it would continue to recognize him as the Nation's permanent representative until such time as he resigned or was removed by the Nation in accordance with certain procedures. According to plaintiffs, on May 21, 1995, the Nation once again removed Halbritter from his position as Oneida representative. Although informed of Halbritter's alleged second removal, the Department had not acted upon that notification by the time of oral argument, and as of the time of this opinion, we have received no information to the contrary."</blockquote>

The district court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss both the non-habeas and habeas claims of the plaintiffs. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the district court.<ref name=WolfClan>{{cite court |litigants=SHENANDOAH v. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR |reporter=F. 3d |opinion=708 |pinpoint= |court=U.S. 2nd Circuit |date=October 6, 1998 |url=http://openjurist.org/159/f3d/708/shenandoah-v-united-states-department-of-the-interior |publisher=OpenJurist.org |accessdate=April 2016 |quote=The district court's judgment is affirmed.}}</ref>

=== External issues ===
External opposition comes from organizations such as [[Upstate Citizens for Equality]] (UCE), a group that opposed Haudenosaunee land claims in upstate New York. UCE also opposed the OIN being able to operate its enterprises tax-free on land it asserted sovereign status.<ref>(see [[Oneida Tribe]])</ref>  These issues were resolved by the [[Oneida Indian Nation#2013 landmark agreement between New York State, Madison and Oneida Counties, and the OIN|2013 landmark agreement]].

====Tax issues====
Disputes have arisen with the state over the OIN's economic advantage of operating the Class III gaming facility without having to collect or pay state taxes on retail sales at the resort. The tribe does pay a portion of the revenues to the state under the gaming compact, (essentially in lieu of taxes). The OIN and other parties believed operations on property it controlled were tax free. ''City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation''.<ref name="Sherill">544 US 197 [2005]</ref>

Vernon Downs opened a casino to try to compete with Turning Stone. Prior to February 2008, the [[racino]] was heavily taxed under state law.<ref name=casinocitytimes>[http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/vernon-downs-bill-voted-down-171189 Vernon to close after State Assembly Gaming Committee fails to pass tax relief]</ref><ref name="Vernon Downs Tax distribution">[https://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/finance/Web%20Site%20Report%20-%20Vernon%20Downs%20Casino.pdf Vernon Downs tax distribution]</ref> Vernon Downs struggled to operate and, in late 2007, many of the original investors pulled out of the venture. The Upstate Citizens for Equality and supporters attributed to the OIN being able to operate its casino tax free.

OIN supporters attribute Vernon Downs's troubles to the state collecting a total of 54% of the revenue in taxes (50% to the state education fund and 4% sales tax), making profitability difficult.<ref name="Vernon Downs Tax distribution"/> On February 11, 2008, Director Steve Gural closed down the racino at Vernon Downs for three days.<ref name=casinocitytimes/><ref>[https://www.harnessracing.com/news/main/vernontore-openastracksreceive90million Vernon to re-open as tracks receive $90 million] February 13, 2008, retrieved January 10, 2019</ref> He was trying to make the state decrease its rate of taxation of the facility, to enable it to be more profitable.[8]<!--The original articles are no longer available online, [http://www.uticaod.com/homepage/x1651595866 Vernon Downs Racino To Close]; [http://www.uticaod.com/homepage/x230381471 Vernon Downs Racino Back On Track] are deadlinks and cannot be independently retrieved --> This period of closure cost the state approximately $1.5 million in lost tax revenues. (The state has earmarked revenues from gambling for education, which was part of the original campaign to have voters approve the state's authorization of gaming activities.)[8] Many argued that the state should not call this "lost revenue." Building the track created the revenue; without the track, there would be no revenue. The track was facing insolvency.

The OIN asserted that it made up for this lack of land tax by donating to local schools in amounts that exceed the taxes which the county would normally receive from the land plots, in a program known as the Silver Covenant Chain Education Grants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oneida-nation.net/BRHISTORY.HTML|title=Oneida Indian Nation - A Brief History<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref>  As tensions increased between the various local governments, the state government, and the OIN, the OIN decreased or stopped the donations.

Stockbridge Valley School has several OIN children as students, but the OIN has discontinued grants to the school because it disapproved of the views of one teacher.<ref>[http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=1074964438 "School caught in Oneida Nation dispute"], ''Indian Country Today'' [2004/01/24&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In late fall 2003, an OIN representative contacted the Stockbridge Valley Community School District and advised that it would not make the Silver Covenant unless a particular teaching assistant was fired.<ref>[http://www.madisoncounty.org/motf/ExhEAffidavitofRRichards62105.pdf R Richards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414200746/http://www.madisoncounty.org/motf/ExhEAffidavitofRRichards62105.pdf |date=2007-04-14 }}, Madison County</ref>

===Potential pact between Oneida County and the OIN in 2009===
On May 8, 2009, Anthony Picente, Oneida County Executive, announced a pact between Oneida County and the OIN.<ref>[http://www.wktv.com/news/local/44613472.html Picente Announces Agreement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527075051/http://www.wktv.com/news/local/44613472.html |date=2011-05-27 }}, WKTV</ref>  The Oneida County Board of Legislators and the State legislature would have had to approve this pact within the next 60 days.  If this pact had been approved, the OIN would have paid $55 million to Oneida County over the next 10 years, beginning with a $30 million lump sum payment the same year.  Additionally, the OIN would have made make Silver Covenant Grants for the next five years, in order to apply for more trust land without county opposition.  In return for this, the county would have agreed to drop its lawsuits and satisfy all pending tax lien and tax foreclosure proceedings.  The OIN would have agreed to impose a sales tax on all businesses situated on its lands equal to Oneida County's sales tax rate.  This OIN sales tax would have been imposed on all non-Indian patrons as well as tribal members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.co.oneida.ny.us/oneida/node/435 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531104734/http://www.co.oneida.ny.us/oneida/node/435 |archive-date=May 31, 2009 |title=Picente Announces Oneida County Partnership Plan |publisher=[[Oneida County, New York]] |date=May 8, 2009 |accessdate=November 19, 2018}}</ref>

The pact would have required the Oneida County Sheriff and the OIN Police Department to negotiate a law enforcement pact to settle questions of jurisdictional authority and operations.<ref name="ibid jan 2019" />  On May 27, 2009, the County Board of Legislators rejected the proposed pact, citing many reasons for rejecting the proposed agreement.<ref name="ibid jan 2019" />

==2013 landmark agreement between New York State, Madison and Oneida Counties, and the OIN==
On May 16, 2013, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the OIN reached a settlement agreement between the state, and Oneida and Madison counties.<ref name="OIN and Cuomo" />  The agreement resolved multiple legal issues between the parties.  Pursuant to the agreement, the OIN would pay 25% of its revenue to the State, a quarter of which is paid to Oneida County and Madison County.  These monies are to offset any property and sales taxes the Counties would otherwise receive if the property remained on the tax rolls.  The State and Madison and Oneida counties agree to withdraw their objections to the OIN's land-trust application, with a cap of {{convert|25000|acres|mi2+km2}} that can be transferred to the federal government.  The OIN will have a 10-county (Oneida, Madison, Onondaga, Cayuga, Herkimer, Oswego, Cortland, Chenango, Otsego, and Lewis counties) geographic gambling monopoly.  The OIN will implement a sales tax system to tax products sold to non-Indians on Indian Territory, such as cigarettes.  And the agreement would terminate all related litigation between the OIN, the state, and Madison and Oneida Counties.  This agreement required the State Legislature, the Oneida County and Madison County Boards of Legislators, the US Department of the Interior, and the Judiciary to ratify this agreement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianz.com/docs/court/cayuga/280-4.pdf|title=Agreement text|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref>

On May 28, 2013, the Oneida County Board of Legislators approved the agreement in a 16-13 vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocgov.net/node/1758|title=Historic Settlement Agreement Approved|work=ocgov.net|access-date=2014-09-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116090406/http://ocgov.net/node/1758|archive-date=2013-11-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>  On May 29, 2013, New York State, through Governor Cuomo, signed the agreement.  On May 30, 2013, the Madison County Board of Supervisors approved the agreement in a weighted vote of 847-653.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/05/madison_county_oneida_nation-n.html|title=Madison County approves Oneida nation-New York land, taxes agreement|work=syracuse.com}}</ref>  On January 1, 2014, the US Department of the Interior approved of the agreement.  On June 22, 2013, both the state Senate (48-11) and the state Assembly (83-44) approved the agreement.  The final entity to approve the agreement was the Judiciary.  On March 4, 2014, US District Court Judge Kahn approved the settlement agreement.  On September 4, 2014, the {{convert|13000|acres|mi2+km2}} of OIN real property was formally transferred into US trust.

On August 19, 2013, the Towns of Vernon and Verona jointly filed a lawsuit to oppose the ratified settlement, citing a violation of their freedom of speech and equal protection.  On October 30, 2013, US District Court Judge Kahn remanded the lawsuit to the state court system because the towns lacked standing.  On June 27, 2014, Albany County Supreme Court denied and dismissed the lawsuit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2014/2014-ny-slip-op-51332-u.html|title=Matter of Town of Verona (Oneida County) v Cuomo|work=Justia Law}}</ref>

===OIN revenue sharing agreement===
Oneida County offered an OIN revenue sharing agreement with at least five municipalities affected most by the 2013 landmark agreement.<ref>[http://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-oneida-daily-dispatch-oneida-ny/20140605/281492159374340 Town of Augusta, Village of Vernon, and City of Sherill approved OIN revenue sharing agreement with Oneida County as of June 4, 2014]</ref>  The five municipalities offered this deal are the City of Sherrill, Town of Sylvan, Town of Verona, Village of Vernon, and Town of Augusta.<ref name="ibid jan 2019" />  On May 27, 2014 the Sherrill City Commission voted 3-1 to accept $160,000 annually from Oneida County, in exchange for the current commission and future commissions waiving their right to challenge the settlement.<ref>[http://www.sherrillny.org/wp-content/uploads/02012/06/14-05-27.doc May 27, 2014 Agenda Minutes]</ref>  On May 29, 2014, the Vernon Village Board unanimously agreed to receive annual payments of $60,000 from Oneida County in exchange for the current board and future boards waiving their right to challenge the settlement.<ref>[http://www.villageofvernonny.org/articles/article/8882638/178831.htm Meeting Minutes]</ref>  On June 7, 2014, the Town of Augusta accepted an agreement with Oneida County.  By a 3-1 vote, the town will receive $107,500 a year as compensation for lost property tax revenue based on OIN trust lands.<ref>[http://www.ocgov.net/sites/default/files/budget/2015/2015%20Adopted%20Budget%20-%2012-30-14.pdf 2015 Oneida County Budget] at p. 42; [http://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-oneida-daily-dispatch-oneida-ny/20140605/281492159374340 Town of Augusta, Village of Vernon, and City of Sherill approved OIN revenue sharing agreement with Oneida County as of June 4, 2014]</ref>

Since then, several other municipalities and school districts have requested to become part of the OIN revenue sharing agreement.  However, to do this, Oneida County is trying to undo its agreements with the prior municipalities in order to do a new agreement that covers all of the affected municipalities.  This has drawn strong opposition from the original municipalities that accepted the initial agreement.<ref>[http://romesentinel.com/county/two-municipalities-balk-at-zeroing-out-gaming-revenue-sharing/QBqrkm!Ge1EcGh5pYenSkNRxvSAKQ/ Two municipalities balk at zeroing out gaming revenue sharing agreement]</ref>
