'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' persons in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Indiana]] enjoy most of the same rights as other people, but still may face some challenges that non-[[LGBT]] residents do not otherwise face. [[Same-sex marriage in Indiana|Same-sex marriage]] has been legal in Indiana since October 6, 2014, when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider an appeal in the case of ''[[Baskin v. Bogan]]''.

A landmark April 2017 court ruling held that discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]] is tantamount to discrimination on account of "sex", as defined by the ''[[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]''. The ruling, issued by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]], establishes sexual orientation as a protected characteristic in the workplace, forbidding unfair discrimination. Nevertheless, LGBT rights in Indiana are still quite limited in comparison to other states with much more liberal laws. To this day, state statutes have not yet been amended to include sexual orientation and [[gender identity]] among its non-discrimination grounds.

==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==
In 1795, Indiana as part of the [[Northwest Territory]] received the English "buggery" law, which punished male [[sodomy]] with [[Capital punishment|death]]. In 1807, the [[Indiana Territory]] enacted a criminal code which included a sodomy provision, eliminating the gender-specifics (meaning it would be applicable to both heterosexual and homosexual conduct), reducing the penalty to one to five years' imprisonment, a fine of 100 to 500 [[United States dollar|dollars]], up to 500 lashes and a permanent loss of civil rights. Sodomy was briefly legal between the years 1852 and 1881, as a new criminal code was passed without any mention to sodomy. In 1881, the state passed a statute outlawing [[anal intercourse]], [[fellatio]] (oral sex) as well as masturbation under the age of 21 (which was labelled "self-pollution") for both heterosexuals and homosexuals. Penalty was set at "not more than fourteen years nor less than two years". In the 1923 case of ''Young v. State'', the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] unanimously ruled that [[cunnilingus]] was also criminal, and in 1939, in ''Connell v. State'', rejected contentions had the statute applied only to homosexual sexual activity.<ref name="Indiana1">{{cite web |last=Painter |first=George|title=The History of Sodomy Laws in the United States: Indiana |url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/sensibilities/indiana.htm|work=The Sensibilities of Our Forefathers|publisher=Gay & Lesbian Archives of the Pacific Northwest}}</ref>

In 1949, the state passed a psychopathic offender law, under which any person above 16 years of age suffering from a "mental disorder" "coupled with criminal propensities to the commission of sex offenses" would be labelled a "criminal sexual psychopathic person". Those convicted of sodomy would not be able to leave correctional institutions until their "full recovery of criminal psychopathy". A law review article in 1947 showed 160 commitments under the law, of which 60 (38%) were for sodomy and none of the offenders had been a woman. A majority of these commitments were for heterosexual conduct. In 1959, an amendment to the law meant that those refusing to cooperate with examining psychiatrists could be held in contempt of court. In 20 years of operation, only 10 "consensual adult homosexuals" were committed under the law. The law was upheld by the Indiana Supreme Court in 1968 in ''State ex rel. Haskett v. Marion County Criminal Court, Division One et al''. In 1971, the [[Indiana General Assembly]] amended the law, removing sodomy from the list of triggering offenses, if consensual and committed with an adult person.<ref name="Indiana1"/>

In 1967, in a divided 3-2 ruling, the Indiana Supreme Court upheld as constitutionally sufficient an indictment charging the "abominable and detestable crime against nature". Justice Amos W. Jackson dissented, writing that the
{{quote|very language of the statute purporting to define the offense of sodomy, is so indefinite and uncertain that its unconstitutionality follows as certainly as night follows day.}}

Jackson further wrote that he
{{quote|hoped that the incoming legislature will either clarify or abolish this anarchism reminiscent of the heyday of the witch hunts of early colonial times. In today's space age and sophisticated society, it seems that the statute should spell out in language understandable by the person of average scholastic attainment and intelligence the specific nature of the crime with which he is charged and if that cannot be done then it should not be denominated a crime.}}

In 1968, in ''[[Cotner v. Henry]]'', the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that married couples could not be prosecuted under the sodomy statute. In ''Dickson v. State'' (1971), the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the sodomy law, in a divided 3-2 vote.<ref name="Indiana1"/> Dissenting, Justice Roger DeBruler wrote that the
{{quote|moral preferences of the majority may not be imposed on everyone else unless there exists some harm to other persons. Sexual acts between consenting adults in private do not harm anyone else and should be free from state regulation.}}

Annual attempts to adopt a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman have failed since 2004. Indiana requires that two separately elected legislatures approve an amendment for it to be put to a popular vote.

Governor [[Joe Kernan (politician)|Joe Kernan]] issued an executive order in 2004 protecting state employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as gender identity and expression. In 2005, Governor [[Mitch Daniels]] added the terms "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" to the list of protected categories in state employment covered by the state's Equal Employment Opportunity policy.<ref>{{cite news|work=Baptist Press |first=James |last=Patterson |url= http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=21357 |title='Sexual orientation' policy remains sore spot for Ind. governor|date= August 5, 2005 |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}</ref>

In 2013, Kim Hively filed a lawsuit against the [[Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana]] in [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], arguing that she was denied promotions and let go from her job because of her sexual orientation. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] heard oral arguments in the case, known as ''[[Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College]]'', in November 2016 with discussion focusing on the meaning of the word "sex" in Title VII of the ''Civil Rights Act'', which bans workplace discrimination based on race, religion, national origin or sex. On April 4, 2017, the Court of Appeals ruled in an 8-3 vote that the ''[[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]'' prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation via the category of "sex". Ivy Tech subsequently stated they would not appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-law-covers-lgbt-workplace-bias-20170404-story.html |author=Briscoe, Tony |title=Court: Civil Rights Act covers LGBT workplace bias |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=April 4, 2017}}</ref> [[Human Rights Campaign]] hailed the ruling, saying: "Today's ruling is a monumental victory for fairness in the workplace, and for the dignity of lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans who may live in fear of losing their job based on whom they love."<ref>[https://www.hrc.org/blog/ruling-affirms-civil-rights-laws-protect-employees-from-discrimination Ruling Affirms Civil Rights Laws Protect Employees from Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation] ''Human Rights Campaign''</ref> The court decision establishes that workplace discrimination on account of sexual orientation (such as in hiring or promotions, etc.) violates federal civil rights law, and is therefore prohibited.

On April 2, 2015, Governor Pence signed a measure into law which was intended to be a clarification of the newly enacted legislation. Specifically, the new language says the RFRA does not authorize a provider — including businesses or individuals — to refuse to offer or provide services, facilities, goods, employment, housing or public accommodation to any member of the public based on sexual orientation or gender identity, in addition to race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex or military service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/01/indiana-rfra-deal-sets-limited-protections-for-lgbt/70766920/|title=Gov.

==Adoption and parenting==
Indiana statutes permit single LGBT persons to adopt. The state [[Indiana Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] ruled in 2006 that unmarried couples, including same-sex couples, may adopt as well.

In 2005, the Indiana Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that lesbian partners who agree to conceive a child through artificial insemination are both the legal parents of any children born to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivf1.com/indiana-legislature-rules/|title=Indiana legislature rules in favor of lesbian couples using donor insemination}}</ref> Indiana law allows any woman to undergo [[artificial insemination]].

On June 30, 2016, a federal judge ruled in ''Henderson v. Box'' that Indiana must allow same-sex couples to list both their names on their children's birth certificates. The ruling came as a result of a federal lawsuit filed by eight same-sex couples who were unable to list the non-gestational parent's name on the child's birth certificate. When an opposite-sex couple had a child, the state granted a "presumption of parenthood" to the father and listed him on the birth certificate. However, when a same-sex couple had a child, the state denied that presumption and forced the second partner to undergo an adoption, a "long, arduous and expensive" process.<ref>[http://www.thestarpress.com/story/news/local/2016/07/31/local-same-sex-couple-celebrate-birth-certificate-win/87610174/ Same-sex Indiana couple celebrates birth certificate win]</ref><ref>[http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2016/06/30/same-sex-couples-win-birth-certificate-lawsuit/86558482/ Same-sex couples win birth certificate lawsuit]</ref> In January 2017, Attorney General [[Curtis Hill]] appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/31/state-appeals-ruling-parental-rights-same-sex-couples-birth-certificate-lawsuit/97252040/ |author=Wang, Stephanie |title=State appeals ruling on parental rights for same-sex couples |publisher=Indy Star |date=January 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theindianalawyer.com/articles/49900-same-sex-birth-certificate-case-stalls-at-7th-circuit-putting-families-in-limbo|title=Same-sex birth certificate case stalls at 7th Circuit, putting families in limbo|website=The Indiana Lawyer|date=April 4, 2019}}</ref> which unanimously upheld it on January 17, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/01/indiana-same-sex-marriage-birth-certificate.html|title=After 32 Month Delay, 7th Circuit Affirms Equal Rights for Same-Sex Parents|website=Slate|date=January 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/17-1141/17-1141-2020-01-17.html|title=Henderson v.

[[Surrogacy]] contracts are "void and unenforceable" in Indiana. While surrogacy is not specifically illegal in the state and can be practiced, courts will generally refuse to recognize such contracts, so intended parents, including same-sex couples, must complete an adoption application.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americansurrogacy.com/surrogacy/indiana-surrogacy-laws|title=What You Need to Known About Surrogacy in Indiana|work=American Surrogacy}}</ref>

Transgender persons in Indiana may change their legal gender following several legal requirements, including a certified court order, submitting an application for a birth certificate and a copy of a photo ID to the Corrections Section of the Indiana State Department of Health Vital Records, and paying the applicable fees. [[Sex reassignment surgery]] is not required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indianatransgendernetwork.com/resources/legal/changing-name-gender-markers-legal-documents/|title=Changing Name and Gender Markers on Legal Documents|date=February 25, 2015}}</ref>

On January 12, 2017, Representative [[Bruce Borders]] introduced a bill in the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] that would have prevented transgender people from changing their legal gender on their birth certificates.<ref>[http://lawnewz.com/important/bill-would-stop-trans-people-from-changing-sex-on-birth-certificates/ Bill Would Stop Trans People from Changing Sex on Birth Certificates] LawNewz</ref> Freedom Indiana stated the bill denied "the very existence of transgender people, the identity they live as and the person they have always known themselves to be."<ref>[http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/13/republican-quashes-anti-transgender-bill/96553428/ Republican quashes anti-transgender bill] The Indianapolis Star</ref> One day later, Representative Cindy Kirchhofer, chair of the House Public Health Committee, denied the bill a hearing, effectively killing it.<ref>[http://www.newnownext.com/indiana-transgender-cindy-kirchhofer/01/2017/ Republican Lawmaker Makes Surprise Showing Of LGBT Support, Blocks Anti-Trans Bill] NewNextNow</ref>

In March 2019, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles began offering a "[[Legal recognition of non-binary gender|gender X]]" option on [[driver's license]]s. To request the "X" designation, applicants will need to present a certified, amended [[birth certificate]] that attests to the gender change or a signed, dated physician's statement confirming a permanent gender change.<ref name="nyi">{{cite web|url=https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/indiana-driver-s-licenses-now-offer-x-gender-option-for/article_7009d913-f93a-53b8-9d6f-dae15d734bbf.html|title=Indiana driver's licenses now offer 'X' gender option for non-binary Hoosiers|work=nwi.com|date=March 11, 2019}}</ref>

==Hate crime law==
Previously, Indiana collected data on "bias crimes", which had included sexual orientation bias since 2003, but did not criminalize them as [[hate crime]]s nor alter proposed sentencing requirements due to sexual orientation bias.<ref name="Human Rights Campaign">{{cite web|title=A Guide to  State Level Advocacy  Following Enactment of  the Matthew Shepard  and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act|url=http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/assets/resources/Hate_Crimes_Guide_FINAL.pdf|website=Human Rights Campaign|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=October 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025201203/http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/assets/resources/Hate_Crimes_Guide_FINAL.pdf|archive-date=October 25, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="in.gov">{{cite web|title=Indiana Code 10-13-3 - Criminal History Information|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/2010/title10/ar13/ch3.html|website=Indiana General Assembly|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref> Such hate crimes, however, are covered federally under the ''[[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]]''.

In April 2019, the [[Indiana General Assembly]] passed a bill with various controversial and contentious amendments on [[hate crime]]s. Unlike other hate crime laws in the [[United States]], Indiana's law does not list specific categories, instead "[making] it an aggravating circumstance that a crime was committed with the intent to harm or intimidate an individual or a group of individuals because of certain perceived or actual characteristics". [[Governor of Indiana|Governor]] [[Eric Holcomb]] signed the bill into law on April 3.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/04/indiana-hate-crimes-bill-signed-into-law/|title=Indiana hate crimes bill signed into law|work=Jurist|date=April 3, 2019|last=Bell|first=Brianna}}</ref><ref name="fox">{{cite web|url=https://fox59.com/2019/04/02/hate-crimes-bill-passes-in-senate-without-specific-gender-protections-heads-to-gov-holcombs-desk-for-signature/|title=Gov. Holcomb signs hate crimes bill without specific gender protections into law|work=Fox59|date=April 2, 2019}}</ref> The lact of a specific list of categories drew criticism and claims that it violates the [[vagueness doctrine]]. As a result of the law, judges may consider a stricter sentence for someone who committed a crime based on the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wthr.com/article/former-supreme-court-justice-says-new-hate-crimes-law-protects-gender-gender-identity|title=Former IN Supreme Court justice says new hate crimes law protects gender, gender identity|work=WTHR|date=April 3, 2019}}</ref>

==Public opinion==
A 2017 [[Public Religion Research Institute]] (PRRI) opinion poll found that 58% of Indiana residents supported same-sex marriage, while 34% opposed it and 9% were unsure.<ref>[http://ava.prri.org/home#lgbt/2017/States/lgbt_ssm/m/US-IN Public opinion on same-sex marriage by state: Indiana], ''PRRI – American Values Atlas''</ref>

The same poll found that 66% of Indiana residents supported an anti-discrimination law covering sexual orientation and gender identity. 25% were opposed.<ref name="prri">[http://ava.prri.org/home#lgbt/2017/States/lgbtdis/m/US-IN Public opinion on LGBT nondiscrimination laws by state: Indiana], ''PRRI – American Values Atlas''</ref> Furthermore, 54% were against allowing public businesses to refuse to serve LGBT people due to religious beliefs, while 37% supported allowing such religiously-based refusals.<ref>[http://ava.prri.org/home#lgbt/2017/States/srvref/m/US-IN Public opinion on religiously based refusals to serve gay and lesbian people by state: Indiana], ''PRRI – American Values Atlas''</ref>
