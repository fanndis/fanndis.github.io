'''Ixelles''' ({{IPA-fr|iksɛl|-}}; Dutch: '''Elsene''' {{IPA-nl|ˈɛlsənə|pron|Nl-Elsene.ogg}}) is one of the nineteen [[Municipalities of Belgium|municipalities]] of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] of Belgium.

Ixelles is located in the suburbs towards the south of Brussels' city centre and is [[exclave|geographically bisected]] by the [[City of Brussels]]. It is also bordered by the municipalities of [[Auderghem]], [[Etterbeek]], [[Forest, Belgium|Forest]], [[Uccle]], [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]] and [[Watermael-Boitsfort]]. It is generally considered an affluent area of the city<ref name=WIE1/> and is particularly noted for its communities of European and Congolese immigrants.<ref name=WIE1>{{cite web|title=Ixelles and St Gilles|url=http://brussels.wantedineurope.com/areas/51/ixelles-and-st-gilles.html|work=Areas in Brussels|publisher=Wanted in Europe: Brussels|access-date=16 June 2013}}</ref> In common with all of Brussels' municipalities, it is legally [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] (French–Dutch).

==Geography==
Ixelles is located in the south of [[Brussels]] and is divided into two parts by [[Avenue Louise|Avenue Louise/Louizalaan]], which is part of the [[City of Brussels]]. The municipality's smaller western part includes [[Rue du Bailli|Rue du Bailli/Baljuwstraat]] and extends roughly from Avenue Louise to {{lang|fr|Avenue Brugmann|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Brugmannlaan|italic=no}}, whilst its larger eastern part includes campuses of Brussels' two leading universities; the French-speaking [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|Université libre de Bruxelles]] and the Dutch-speaking [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], along with [[Flagey Square|Eugène Flagey Square]]. The [[Bois de la Cambre|Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos]] is located just south of Ixelles.

The construction of Avenue Louise was commissioned in 1847 as a monumental avenue bordered by [[Aesculus hippocastanum|chestnut trees]] that would allow easy access to the popular recreational area of the Bois de la Cambre. It was also to be the first [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Haussmann-esque]] artery of the city of Brussels. However, fierce resistance to the project was put up by the town of Ixelles (which was then still separate from Brussels) through whose land the avenue was supposed to run. After years of fruitless negotiations, Brussels finally annexed the narrow band of land needed for the avenue in addition to the Bois de la Cambre itself in 1864. That decision is the reason for the unusual shape of today's [[City of Brussels]] and for the separation of Ixelles into two separate areas.

==History==

===Medieval origins===
The placename was first mentioned in 1210 as ''Elsela'', from the [[Old Dutch]] {{lang|odt|Else(n)lo}}, meaning [[alder]] woods.<ref>Jan de Vries, Woordenboek der Noord- en Zuidnederlandse plaatsnamen, Het Spectrum publishers, 1962</ref> The origins of the village date from the foundation of [[La Cambre Abbey]]. [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Hendrik I, Duke of Brabant]], donated the Pennebeke domain (''Pennebeek'' was the original name of the Maalbeek spring) to the [[Cistercian]] nun Gisela in 1201. She in turn founded the Abbey, and in 1210, acquired property on which the duke ordered the construction of a mill.<ref name=Herla/> The marshlands around the Abbey were later drained and sanitised, which resulted in four springs which served as a source of fish for the Abbey's inhabitants and the neighbouring hamlets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://document.environnement.brussels/opac_css/elecfile/IF%20EV%20VIJVERS%20VAN%20ELSENE%20DEF%20NL|title=DE VIJVERS VAN ELSENE|website=Leefmilieu Brussel|access-date=30 October 2019}}</ref> The Abbey was located near the springs of the Maelbeek river in the [[Sonian Forest]], the remnant of which closest to Brussels became known as the [[Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos]] in the 19th century. The Abbey was recognised by Jan III van Bethune, the [[Bishop of Cambrai]], in 1202, soon after its foundation.<ref name=Meganck>{{Cite journal|last=Marc|first=Meganck|date=2016|title=De Ter Kamerenabdij|url=http://www.irismonument.be/pdf/nl/36943-Ter_Kamerenabdij.pdf|journal=Inventaris van het Bouwkundig Erfgoed van het Brussels Hoofstedelijk Gewest|pages=46|via=City of Brussels Archives}}</ref> The saints [[Boniface of Brussels]] and [[Alice of Schaerbeek]] were two of its most famous residents in the 13th century.
[[File:Abb.de la Cambre 04.JPG|thumb|[[La Cambre Abbey]], founded in 1201|alt=|left]]

Around 1300, during the reign of [[John II, Duke of Brabant]], a hostel was built near the abbey to provide meals to the wood bearers working in the forest. Soon, a hamlet and a couple of chapels were built, including the Church of the Holy Cross ({{lang-fr|link=no|Église Sainte-Croix}}, {{lang-nl|link=no|Heilig-Kruiskerk}}), also inaugurated by the Bishop of Cambrai and dedicated to Mary and the Holy Cross in 1459 (the Bishop of Cambrai is said to have brought two pieces of the original cross with him).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bruzz.be/samenleving/gehucht-elsene-ontstond-14de-eeuw-nabij-de-vijvers-2008-07-03|title=Gehucht Elsene ontstond in 14de eeuw nabij de Vijvers|website=www.bruzz.be|language=nl|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> Initially, these hamlets and provisions were constructed for the labourers that helped drain and sanitise the marshlands. At that time, part of Ixelles was a dependence of Brussels; the other part was the property of the local lord.

===Before the Revolution===
In 1478, the wars between [[Louis XI of France]] and [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], brought devastation to the Abbey and the surrounding areas. In 1585, during the period of the [[Spanish Netherlands|Habsburg Netherlands]], the Spanish burnt down most of the buildings to prevent them from being used as a refuge by the [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. The Abbey was restored in time for the [[Joyous Entry]] of the Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]] in 1599. Further manors and castles (Ermitage, Ten Bosch and Ixelles, for example) were built in Ixelles in the 16th century, gradually transforming the hamlet into a full-fledged village.

Thanks to the Maalbeek springs and the purity of its waters, the brewing industry became active in the area. It started inside the Abbey, but by the 16th century, had expanded beyond its walls. Due to the liberalisation of the beer industry by the Council of Brabant in 1602, the brewing industry grew, which resulted in a lively scene by the banks of the spring. By the 17th and 18th centuries, around 20 breweries-cabaretiers had settled in Ixelles, among which Saint-Hubert, De Sterre and L’Italie.<ref name=Herla>{{Cite report|first=Michèle|last=Herla|date=2016|title=ELSENE: Geschiedenis van de stedenbouwkundige ontwikkeling – Deel 2|trans-title=ELSENE: History of urban development – Part 2|url=http://www.irismonument.be/pdf/nl/1050-Elsene_stedenbouwkundige_ontwikkeling_2.pdf|publisher=Gewestelijke Overheidsdienst Brussel, Directie Monumenten en Landschappen, CCN [Brussels Regional Public Service, Monuments and Landscapes Directorate, CCN]|language=nl|via=www.irismonument.be}}</ref>

===Independent municipality===
In 1795, like many other towns surrounding Brussels, Ixelles was proclaimed a separate municipality by the [[French First Republic|French]] regime after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]. The municipalities of Neder-Elsene (where the Abbey is located), Opper-Elsene (a Brussels suburb), Boondaal, Tenbos, and Solbos, all became part of Ixelles. Moreover, the Abbey was stripped of its religious functions, becoming among others a cotton-manufacturing plant, a farm, a military school, and a hospital. Many of the [[Fortifications of Brussels|medieval gates of Brussels]] that lined what is now the [[Small ring (Brussels)|inner ring road]] were taken down and more streets were built to accommodate the migration towards the suburbs. Ixelles' population grew nearly one-hundredfold, from 677 in 1813 to more than 58,000 in 1900.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} With this intense growth also came the [[Francization of Brussels|Frenchification]] of Ixelles.

At the end of the 19th century, some of the ponds were drained, leaving only the so-called "[[Ixelles Ponds]]", and a new Church of the Holy Cross was built in 1860. The first [[Trams in Brussels|trams]] appeared in 1884 and the first [[Cinema of Belgium|cinema]] in 1919. Ixelles and Avenue Louise became one of the most fashionable areas of Brussels. Artists and celebrities moved in, leading to architectural novelties such as [[Art Nouveau in Brussels|Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].

==Matongé==
[[File:App0174.jpg|thumb|''[[Namur Gate|Porte de Namour]]'' around 1900]]
{{anchor|Matongé (Ixelles)}}
Ixelles is known throughout Belgium for its large community of people of [[Sub-Saharan Africa|African]] origin. This population is mainly concentrated near the [[Namur Gate]] (French: ''Porte de Namur'', Dutch: ''Naamsepoort''), and the neighbourhood is nicknamed ''Matongé'' or ''Matongué'' after [[Matongé (Kinshasa)|the marketplace and the commercial district]] with the same name in [[Kalamu (Kinshasa)|Kalamu]], [[Kinshasa]] ([[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). The core of ''Matongé'' was formed in late 1950s by the foundation of ''Maisaf'' (an abbreviation of ''Maison Africaine'' or ''African House'') which served as a centre and residence for university students from the [[Belgian Congo]]. After Congolese independence in 1960, the district faced an influx of immigrants from the [[Republic of Congo (Léopoldville)|new state]] who shaped the neighbourhood in a style to resemble the original ''Matongé''. During the sixties and into the seventies, the area was a well known meeting place for students and diplomats from [[Zaire]]. At the time they were known locally as ''Belgicains''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  There are also communities from other African countries, mainly from [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Mali]], [[Cameroon]], and [[Senegal]], present in the district.

The famous shopping arcades, the ''Galerie d'Ixelles'' and the ''Galerie de la Porte de Namur'' are both located in the heart of ''Matongé''. In the gallery and the adjoining streets, a large number of specialised food shops and suppliers can be found. The area is renowned for its clothes, shoes and material shops, hairdressers and wigmakers, booksellers, jewellers and craft shops, making the area unmissable for many local and even international visitors, men and women, young and old. Over 45 different nationalities amongst the residents and shopkeepers can be counted, including most African countries. Statistically, many of the shopkeepers are not necessarily local residents. Amongst the visitors and window shoppers to ''Matongé'' are many who appreciate African fashion and the life-style.

The district also attained notoriety from the early 2000s with [[gang violence]] perpetrated by African gangs, partly composed of exiled [[child soldiers]] like ''Black Démolition''. It was the scene of [[race riots]] in January 2001. ''Matongé'', with its more recent immigrant communities from Latin America, Pakistan, and India along with African ones, is seen as a symbol of [[multiculturalism]] in Belgium. The local authorities, community groups and residents with a certain degree of success have more recently re-established the area as a safe place to visit. As the area and property ages there is increased pressure and interest from property developers to expand the [[Brussels and the European Union#Quarter|European Quarter]] on one side and the fashionable Avenue Louise on the other, effectively ''Matongé'' is sandwiched between the two.

Every year since 2001 at the end of June, a successful multi-cultural festival, ''Matonge en Couleurs'', has been organised in the area. The date coincides with the celebration of Congolese independence. The film ''[[Juju Factory]]'', released in 2006, was partly filmed in the area. The local television channel ''Télé Bruxelles'' broadcasts a weekly magazine programme, ''Téle Matongé XL''.

The pedestrian street {{lang|fr|Rue Longue Vie|italic=no}}/{{lang|nl|Lange-Levenstraat|italic=no}} is full of snack-bars where [[African food]] is sold. Most of these have been decorated by the famous Afro-European artist John Bush. ''Le Soleil d'Afrique'' has almost become his museum, with not only his original paintings on display, but also other painted surfaces and furniture.
