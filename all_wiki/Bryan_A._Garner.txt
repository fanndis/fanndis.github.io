==Early life==
Garner was born on November 17, 1958,{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} in [[Lubbock, Texas]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.city-data.com/city/Lubbock-Texas.html|title= Lubbock, Texas|publisher=City-Data.com|accessdate= May 31, 2014}}</ref> and raised in [[Canyon, Texas]]. He attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he published excerpts from his senior thesis, notably "Shakespeare's Latinate Neologisms"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|date=1982|title=Shakespeare's Latinate Neologisms|journal=Shakespeare Studies|volume=15|pages=149–70}}</ref> and "Latin-Saxon Hybrids in Shakespeare and the Bible".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|date=June 1983|title=Latin-Saxon Hybrids in Shakespeare and the Bible|journal=Studies in the Humanities|volume=10|pages=39–44}}</ref><ref>John W.

After receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, Garner entered the [[University of Texas School of Law]], where he served as an associate editor of the ''[[Texas Law Review]]''.{{fact|date=September 2019}}

==Career==
After receiving his [[Juris Doctor]] degree in 1984, he clerked for Judge [[Thomas M. Reavley]] of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] before he joined the Dallas firm of Carrington, Coleman, Sloman & Blumenthal. He then returned to the University of Texas School of Law and was named director of the Texas/Oxford Center for Legal Lexicography.{{fact|date=September 2019}}

In 1990, he left the university to found LawProse Inc., which provides seminars on clear writing, briefing and editing for lawyers and judges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawprose.org/consulting/|title=Consulting|website=LawProse.org|access-date=2016-07-06}}</ref>

Garner has taught at the [[University of Texas School of Law]], the [[UC Berkeley School of Law|University of California at Berkeley (Boalt Hall)]], [[Texas Tech University School of Law]], and [[Texas A&M University School of Law]]. He has been awarded three honorary doctorates ([[Stetson University College of Law|Stetson]], [[University of La Verne College of Law|La Verne]], and [[Western Michigan University Cooley Law School|Thomas M. Cooley Law School]]). He serves on the Board of Advisers of ''[[The Green Bag (1997)|The Green Bag]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greenbag.org/green_bag_edsandads.html |title=Green Bag editors and advisers |website=The Green Bag |access-date=2018-06-28}}</ref>

==Author==
As a student at the University of Texas School of Law in 1981, Garner began noticing odd usages in lawbooks, many of them dating back to [[Shakespeare]]. They became the source material for his first book, ''A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage'' (1987).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1987|isbn=0195043774|location=Oxford}}</ref>  Since 1990, his work has focused on teaching the legal profession clear writing techniques.{{fact|date=September 2019}}

<ref name="winning">{{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=The Winning Brief|date=2004|pages=139–158|edition=2}}</ref><ref name="plain">{{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=Legal Writing in Plain English|date=2001|pages=77–83}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|date=1995|page=156|edition=2}}</ref><ref name="elements">{{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=The Elements of Legal Style|url=https://archive.org/details/elementsoflegals00garn_0|url-access=registration|date=2002|pages=[https://archive.org/details/elementsoflegals00garn_0/page/91 91–92]|edition=2}}</ref> and lectures, Garner has tried to reform the way bibliographic references are "[[wikt:interlard|interlarded]]" (interwoven) in the midst of textual analysis. He argues for putting [[legal citation|citations]] in [[footnote]]s and notes that in-text information that is important but non-bibliographic. He opposes references such as "457 U.S. 423, 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 2521, 89 L.Ed.2d 744, 747" as interruptions in the middle of a line. However, such interruptions in judges' opinions and in lawyers' briefs have remained the norm. Some courts and advocates around the country have begun adopting Garner's recommended style of footnoted citations, and a surprising degree of internal strife has resulted within some organizations. For example, one appellate judge in Louisiana refused to join in a colleague's opinions written in the new format.<ref name="William Glaberson 2001, pp. 1, 16">{{cite news|last1=Glaberson|first1=William|title=Legal Citations1 on Trial in Innovation v. Tradition|work=The New York Times|date=8 July 2001|pages=1, 16}}</ref>

Garner says that one of the main reasons for the reform is to make legal writing more comprehensible to readers who lack a legal education. That has attracted opposition, most notably from Judge [[Richard Posner]] of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]],<ref>Richard A. Posner, [http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr38-2/CR38-2Posner.pdf "Against Footnotes"], 38 Court Rev. 24 (Summer 2001) (answering Garner, [http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr38-2/CR38-2Garner.pdf "Clearing the Cobwebs from Judicial Opinions"], 38 Court Rev. 4 (Summer 2001)).</ref> and from his co-author, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]].<ref name="making">{{cite book|last1=Scalia|first1=Antonin|last2=Garner|first2=Bryan A.|title=Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges|date=2008|publisher=West|pages=132–35}}</ref>

Since 1992, Garner has contributed numerous revisions to the field of procedural rules, when he began revising all amendments to the sets of Federal Rules ([[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|Civil]], [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure|Appellate]], [[Federal Rules of Evidence|Evidence]], [[Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure|Bankruptcy]], and [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure|Criminal]]) for the [[Judicial Conference of the United States]].{{fact|date=September 2019}}

Garner and Justice Scalia wrote ''Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges'' (2008). Garner maintains a legal consulting practice, focusing on issues in statutory construction and contractual interpretation.{{fact|date=September 2019}}

===English grammar and usage===
Garner's books on English usage include ''[[Garner's Modern English Usage]]''. This dictionary was the subject of [[David Foster Wallace]]'s essay "Authority and American Usage" in ''[[Consider the Lobster|Consider the Lobster and Other Essays]]'', originally published in the April 2001 issue of ''Harper's Magazine''.  In 2003, Garner contributed a chapter on grammar and usage to the 15th edition of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', and later editions have retained it.{{fact|date=September 2019}}

=== ''Black's Law Dictionary'' ===
In 1995, Garner became the editor in chief of ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''.  He created a panel of international legal experts to improve the specialized vocabulary in the book. Garner and the panel rewrote and expanded the dictionary's lexicographic information.{{fact|date=September 2019}}
