'''Mario Draghi''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|OMRI]] [[Order of Prince Henry|GColIH]] [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|BVO]]}} ({{IPA-it|ˈmaːrjo ˈdraːɡi}}; born 3 September 1947) is an Italian economist who served as [[President of the European Central Bank]] between 2011 and 2019.

===Candidacy===
Draghi was frequently mentioned as a potential successor to [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], whose term as President of the [[European Central Bank]] ended in October 2011.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kort |first=Katharina |date=29 September 2009 |title=Super-Mario für die EZB |newspaper=[[Handelsblatt]] |url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/konjunktur-nachrichten/super-mario-fuer-die-ezb;2462703 }}</ref> Then, in January 2011, German weekly newspaper ''[[Die Zeit]]'' reported, with reference to high-ranking policy-makers in Germany and France, that it is "unlikely" that Draghi will be picked as Trichet's successor.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/19/ecb-germany-draghi-idUSBAT00592720110119 |title=German paper says Draghi's ECB chances diminishing |work=[[Reuters]] |date=19 January 2011}}</ref> However, in February 2011 the situation became further complicated when the main German candidate, [[Axel A.

===Presidency===
In December 2011, Draghi oversaw a €489 billion ($640 b.), three-year loan program from the ECB to European banks. The program was around the same size as the US [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (2008) though still much smaller than the overall US response including the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]]'s [[Federal Reserve responses to the subprime crisis|asset purchases and other actions]] of that time. Draghi's ECB also promptly "repealed the two foolish rate hikes made by his predecessor ...Trichet [and] ... stepped up the bond purchases from struggling euro-zone nations" to help with the [[European sovereign debt crisis|debt crisis]], commentator Steve Goldstein wrote in mid-January, 2012. At that time, "Draghi and all of his colleagues (the decision was unanimous) chose not to cut the price for private-sector loans [below the 1% achieved with the "repeal"], even when he forecasts inflation to fall below the targeted 2% later this year." As such, Goldstein concluded, Draghi would leave more moves to national leaders Sarkozy and German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and [[central banks]], contrasting Draghi's actions with those of the Fed's [[Ben Bernanke]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Goldstein | first = Steve | title = Unlike Bernanke, Draghi doesn't aim to be hero | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/story/unlike-bernanke-draghi-doesnt-aim-to-be-hero-2012-01-12 | work = MarketWatch {{!}} Opinion | date = 12 January 2012 | access-date = 12 January 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Mario Draghi - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Mario Draghi at the [[World Economic Forum]], in 2012.]]
In February 2012, Nobel prize laureate in economics [[Joseph Stiglitz]] argued that, on the issue of the impending [[Greek debt crisis|Greek debt restructuring]], the ECB's insistence that it has to be "voluntary" (as opposed to a default decreed by the Greek authorities) was a gift to the financial institutions that sold credit default insurance on that debt; a position that is unfair to the other parties, and constitutes a moral hazard.<ref>{{cite web | last = Stiglitz | first = Joseph | author-link = Joseph Stiglitz | title = Capturing the ECB | url = http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stiglitz148/English | website = project-syndicate.org | publisher = Project Syndicate | date = 6 February 2012 | accessdate = 14 February 2012 | quote = In fact, the ECB may be putting the interests of the few banks that have written credit-default swaps before those of Greece, Europe's taxpayers, and creditors who acted prudently and bought insurance.}}</ref>

Late in February, 2012, a second, somewhat larger round of ECB loans to European banks was initiated under Draghi, called [[European Central Bank#Long-term refinancing operation|long term refinancing operation (LTRO)]]. One commentator, [[Matthew Lynn]], saw the ECB's injection of funds, along with [[Quantitative easing]] from the US Fed and the [[Bank of England#Asset Purchase Facility|Asset Purchase Facility]] at the Bank of England, as feeding increases in [[oil prices]] in [[World oil market chronology from 2003#2011|2011]] and [[World oil market chronology from 2003#2012|2012]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Lynn | first = Matthew | title = What central banks provide, oil markets take away | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-central-banks-provide-oil-markets-take-away-2012-02-29 | work = MarketWatch | date = 29 February 2012 | access-date = 29 February 2012}}</ref>

In July 2012, in the midst of renewed fears about sovereigns in the eurozone, Draghi stated in a panel discussion that the ECB "...is ready to do ''whatever it takes'' to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough."<ref>{{cite AV media | people= Mario Draghi | date= 26 July 2012 |accessdate= 17 December 2012 | title= ECB's Draghi to the euro's rescue? | medium= Video | publisher= [[Euronews]] via [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq1V0aPEO3c }}</ref> This statement led to a steady decline in bond yields (borrowing costs) for eurozone countries, in particular Spain, Italy and France. In light of slow political progress on solving the eurozone crisis, Draghi's statement has been seen as a major turning point in the fortunes of the eurozone.<ref>{{cite news | last = Watts | first = William L. | title = Here's how things look a year after Mario Draghi pledged 'whatever it takes' to save the euro (blog) | url = http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/07/26/heres-how-things-look-a-year-after-mario-draghi-pledged-whatever-it-takes-to-save-the-euro/ | work = MarketWatch | date = 26 July 2013 | access-date = 17 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Dixon | first = Hugo | author-link = Hugo Dixon | title = Saving face and the Euro will be tough | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/business/global/30iht-dixon30.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 30 July 2012 | access-date = 23 August 2018}}</ref>

In April 2013, Draghi said in response to a question regarding membership in the eurozone that "These questions are formulated by people who vastly underestimate what the euro means for the Europeans, for the euro area. They vastly underestimate the political capital that has been invested in the euro."<ref>{{cite news | last = Boesler | first = Matthew | title = MARIO DRAGHI: Zero hedge readers don't understand the Euro crisis | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/draghi-zero-hedge-readers-dont-understand-euro-crisis-2013-4 | work = [[Business Insider]] | date = 4 April 2013 | access-date = 20 May 2013}}</ref>

In 2015, in an appearance before the European Parliament Draghi said that the future of the eurozone was at risk unless member countries gave up some independence and created more Pan-European government institutions. "We have not yet reached the stage of a genuine monetary union," the central bank president, Mario Draghi, said in a speech to the European Parliament in Brussels. Failure of eurozone countries to harmonize their economies and create stronger institutions, he said, "puts at risk the long-term success of the monetary union when faced with an important shock." Mr. Draghi has often urged eurozone governments to do more to improve their economic performance, for example by overhauling restrictive labor regulations. But it was unusual for him to suggest that the future of the eurozone could depend on whether countries heed his advice.<ref>{{cite news | last = Ewing | first = Jack | title = Eurozone's Future Remains at Risk, Mario Draghi Warns | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/business/mario-draghi-warns-of-risky-future-for-eurozone.html?_r=0 | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 25 February 2015 | access-date = 26 February 2015}}</ref>

On 10 March 2016, Draghi provoked a wave of talks on the concept of "[[helicopter money]]" after declaring at a press conference that he thinks the concept is 'very interesting':

<blockquote>We haven't really thought or talked about helicopter money. It's a very interesting concept that is now being discussed by academic economists and in various environments. But we haven't really studied yet the concept. Prima facie, it clearly involves complexities, both accounting-wise and legal-wise, for our view, but of course by this term "helicopter money" one may mean many different things, and so we have to see that.<ref>{{cite news | title = Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&A) | url = https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2016/html/is160310.en.html | work = ecb.europa.eu | publisher = European Central Bank | date = 10 March 2016 | access-date = 30 April 2016}}</ref></blockquote>
