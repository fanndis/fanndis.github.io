Ebony magazine was founded in 1945 by [[John H. Johnson]], who sought to address African-American issues, personalities and interests in a positive and self-affirming manner.<ref>Wormley, J.

==History==
===1945–1969===
[[File:Blanche-j-lawrence ebony February 1949.png| thumb|right|  Blanche J. Lawrence, "Atom Scientists”, ''Ebony'' magazine, September 1949 (Copyright not renewed)]]

''Ebony'' was founded by John H. Johnson in 1945. The name of the magazine was created by Johnson's wife, Eunice Walker Johnson, in reference to the dark wood.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/business/media/10johnson.html|title=Eunice Johnson Dies at 93; Gave Ebony Its Name|last=Hevesi|first=Dennis|date=2010-01-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The magazine was patterned after the format of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]].<ref>Click, J.

Johnson {{!}} American publisher|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> ''Ebony''<nowiki/>'s content initially focused on African-American sports and entertainment figures, but eventually began including black achievers and celebrities of many different professions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ebony-American-magazine|title=Ebony {{!}} American magazine|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>
Editors stated in the first issue: <blockquote><p>"We like to look at the zesty side of life. Sure, you can get all hot and bothered about the race question (and don't think we don't), but not enough is said about all the swell things we Negroes can do and will accomplish. Ebony will try to mirror the happier side of Negro life - the positive, everyday achievements from Harlem to Hollywood. But when we talk about race as the No. 1 problem of America, we'll talk turkey."<ref name=NYTS>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/06/us/ebony-40-viewed-as-more-than-a-magazine.html The New York Times, EBONY, 40, VIEWED AS MORE THAN A MAGAZINE, By E. R. Shipp], Special To the New York Times, December 6, 1985. Retrieved April 20, 2020.</ref></p></blockquote>

During the 1960s, the magazine increasingly covered the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]]. Articles published in the magazine were about political events happening all over the U.S., in which activists protested racial violence and advocated for increasing social mobility for African Americans across the diaspora were. Also published in the magazine was content about the [[Black Power movement|Black Power Movement]]. In 1965, [[Lerone Bennett Jr.]], a executive editor wrote a recurring column entitled, Black Power, which featured an in-depth profile of [[Stokely Carmichael]] in 1966.<ref>James West (2016) Power is 100 years old: Lerone Bennett Jr., Ebony magazine and the roots of black power, The Sixties, 9:2, pp. 165–188, DOI: 10.1080/17541328.2016.1241601.</ref> Ebony also commemorated historical events that contributed to black citizenship and freedom such as the September 1963 issue that honored the 100 year anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/ebony-magazine/|title=Ebony Magazine • BlackPast|last=Glasrud|first=Bruce|date=2007-09-18|website=BlackPast|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>

===1969–1985===
''Ebony''<nowiki/>'s content and design began to shift in the late–1960s and early–1970s. A new level of competition for subscribers and readers began during the 1970s. Due to the emergence of new African-American oriented magazines such as ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]],'' ''Ebony'' began to cover more political activism and achievements in the 1970s. The magazine's February 1971 cover featured 13 black congressmen and women. ''Ebony'' highlighted the black professionals serving in [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration in the March 1977 issue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Mia L.|date=2015-12-01|title="I Dig You, Chocolate City": Ebony and Sepia Magazines' Coverage of Black Political Progress, 1971–1977|journal=Journal of African American Studies|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=398–409|doi=10.1007/s12111-015-9309-x|s2cid=152126803|issn=1936-4741}}</ref>

===1985–2005===
The magazine reached unprecedented levels of popularity, with marketers estimating that ''Ebony'' reached over 40% of the African-American adults in the United States during the 1980s, a feat unmatched by any other general–interest magazine at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/opinion/ebony-jet-magazine.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Radical Blackness of Ebony Magazine|last=Staples|first=Brent|date=2019-08-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Beginning in the mid–1970s, advertisers created ads specifically for the magazine which featured African-American models using their products.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pollay|first1=Richard W.|last2=Lee|first2=Jung S.|last3=M.B.A|first3=David Carter-Whitney|date=1992-03-01|title=Separate, but Not Equal: Racial Segmentation in Cigarette Advertising|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=21|issue=1|pages=45–57|doi=10.1080/00913367.1992.10673359|issn=0091-3367}}</ref> In 1985, ''Ebony Man'', a monthly men's magazine was created, printing the first issue in September 1985.<ref name="sat" /> By the magazine's 40th anniversary in November 1985, it had a circulation of 1.7 million.<ref name=NYTS/>

===2005–present===
In December 2008, [[Google]] announced that it was scanning back issues for [[Google Book Search]]; all issues from November 1959 to December 2008 are available for free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/search-and-find-magazines-on-google.html|title=Search and find magazines on Google Book Search|author=Dave Foulser|date=December 9, 2008|access-date=January 3, 2009}}</ref> In 2010, the [[Johnson Publishing Company]] sold its historic building at 820 S. Michigan Avenue in Chicago's loop to [[Columbia College Chicago]]. The same year, ''Ebony'' began a redesign process to update its longtime brand. In the past, the magazine was persistently upbeat, much like its postwar contemporary ''Life'' magazine. However, in the 21st century, ''Ebony'' has started to feature more controversial content.

The November 2011 cover featured a pregnant [[Nia Long]], reminiscent of the iconic image of actress [[Demi Moore]] featured naked while pregnant on a major magazine cover two decades before. Some of ''Ebony''′s more conservative readers disagreed with the cover choice, stating it inappropriate to feature an unwed, pregnant woman on the cover. The cover made national headlines, as it was featured in ''[[US Weekly]]'' and in a five-minute segment on [[CNN]]. Recent issues questioned whether President Obama was still right for black America and whether [[biracial]] Americans need more acknowledgment in today's society. In 2018, ''Ebony'''s publishing format was changed; it went from being published monthly to a double issue published once each month.

On May 24, 2019, Clear View Group suspended the print edition of the magazine, with the Spring 2019 issue the last to be printed.<ref name=YGY>Yvonne de Salle, [https://www.tinshingle.com/blog/ebony-magazine-in-flux-reportedly-burns-writers-huge-photo-archive-in-play "EBONY Magazine In Flux - Print Magazine Folds, Digital Seems To Continue"], ''Tin Shingle'', July 8, 2019.

== Notable coverage ==
=== 100 Most Influential Blacks ===
One of the most famous aspects of the magazine was its list of "100 Most Influential Blacks." This list—which began in 1963, took a hiatus until 1971, and has continued on ever since—lists those who have made the greatest impact in the African-American community during the year. Most of those listed were well-educated, with 55 percent having completed a graduate degree.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Henry|first=Charles P.|date=1981|title=Ebony Elite: America's Most Influential Blacks|journal=Phylon|volume=42|issue=2|pages=120–132|doi=10.2307/274717|issn=0031-8906|jstor=274717}}</ref> However, some researchers have noted that black scholars, teachers, and higher-education administrators are rarely, if ever, included on the list.<ref>“Demeaning Stereotypes: Ebony's List of the Most Influential Black Americans.” ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'', no. 17, 1997, pp. 46–47.

=== Coolest Black Family in America ===

Jackson]], [[Denzel Washington]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Billy Dee Williams]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chron.com/life/article/Ebony-magazine-honors-the-coolest-black-men-ever-1787788.php|title=Ebony magazine honors the 'coolest' black men ever|last=Sewing|first=Joy|date=July 9, 2008|website=Houston Chronicle|access-date=December 19, 2019}}</ref>

=== 65th anniversary edition ===
In November 2010, the magazine featured a special 65th-anniversary edition cover featuring [[Taraji P. Henson]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] and [[Mary J. Blige]]. The issue included eight cover recreations from historic and iconic previous covers of ''Ebony''. [[Blair Underwood]] posed inside, as did [[Omar Epps]] and [[Jurnee Smollett]]. [[National Public Radio]] marked this anniversary edition as the beginning of redesign of ''Ebony''. Former White House social secretary [[Desiree Rogers]], of the Obama administration, had become the chief executive officer of the magazine.<ref name="corley">Cheryl Corley, [https://www.npr.org/2011/09/22/140676433/ebony-jet-parent-takes-a-bold-new-tack "'Ebony,' 'Jet' Parent Takes A Bold New Tack"], NPR, September 22, 2011.</ref>
