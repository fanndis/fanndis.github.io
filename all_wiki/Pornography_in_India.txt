'''Pornography in India''' is available in print magazines, but is mainly consumed using the internet. This consumption is increasing with the increased prevalence of smartphones and the internet. Despite the increased access, public discourse and attitudes on pornography remain muted and a taboo in many parts of India. In [[India]], publishing or transmitting [[pornographic material]] is illegal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rajak|first=Brajesh|title=Pornography Laws: XXX Must not be Tolerated|origyear=2011|edition=Paperback|year=2011|publisher=Universal Law Co. |location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-7534-999-5|page=61}}</ref>

==Types of publication==
===Print===
Studies have found that print media is less widely accessible than internet media in India. A randomized survey of 96 random vendors, such as video stores, mobile downloads/recharge stores and cybercafés, in Haryana, India found that 17% displayed pornography openly, 34% displayed it semi-openly, and 49% kept it hidden.<ref name=":0">Ravi Shankar, (2012).

In July 2015 the [[Supreme Court of India]] refused to allow the blocking of pornographic websites and said that watching pornography indoors in the privacy of one's own home was not a crime.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india/it-s-legal-to-watch-porn-in-the-privacy-of-your-house-says-sc/story-WSre0BXJDfHbErouNgmdtK.html|title=It's legal to watch porn in the privacy of your house, says SC|date=2015-07-09|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=2016-12-20}}</ref> In August 2015 the [[Government of India]] issued an order to Indian ISPs to block at least 857 websites that it considered to be pornographic.<ref>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Deccan Chronicle|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/150803/nation-current-affairs/article/porn-ban-complete-list-857-porn-websites-blocked-india|title=Banned: Complete list of 857 porn websites blocked in India|date=4 August 2015|access-date=11 July 2018}}</ref> In 2015 the [[Department of Telecommunications]] (DoT) had asked internet service providers to take down 857 websites in a bid to control cyber crime, but after receiving criticism from the authorities it partially rescinded the ban. The ban from the government came after a lawyer filed a petition in the Supreme Court arguing that online pornography  encourages sex crimes and rapes.<ref>{{cite news|title=India lifts porn ban after widespread outrage|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-33783539|date=5 August 2015|work=BBC News|access-date=11 July 2018}}</ref>

On 26 January 2016, the Supreme Court in written order, instructed govt "to suggest the ways and means so that these activities are curbed. The innocent children cannot be made prey to these kind of painful situations, and a nation, by no means, can afford to carry any kind of experiment with its children in the name of liberty and freedom of expression. When we say nation, we mean each member of the collective".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/jonew/ropor/rop/all/484949.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501162435/http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/jonew/ropor/rop/all/484949.pdf|archive-date=1 May 2018|url-status=dead|title=Writ Petition(s)(Civil)  No(s).  177/2013|publisher=Supreme Court of India|date=26 February 2016}}</ref>

== Socio-cultural attitudes ==
Many sex related topics, such as pornography, are considered taboo in traditional Indian households.<ref name=":1" /> This trend seems to be rapidly changing, especially in urbanized cities. Researchers have found that the primary sex education of youth born in the 1990s onwards in India comes from pornography and conversations amongst their peers, which has been known to cause long term sexual anxiety and frustration in other cultures where youth learn sexual attitudes from pornography.<ref>Abraham, L. (2001). Redrawing the Lakshman rekha: Gender differences and cultural constructions in youth sexuality in urban India. South Asia, 24, 133–156.</ref> However, due to the internet and increased access for the common citizen, pornography has slowly entered the public discourse, most notably with the outrage towards a 2015 government order to censor 857 websites that contained explicit materials.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/05/india-lifts-ban-on-internet-pornography-after-criticisms|title=India lifts ban on internet pornography after criticism|first=Nadia|last=Khomami|date=5 August 2015|accessdate=12 November 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

==Homosexual pornography==
Homosexual pornography is not widely available in print, due to the socio-culture taboo surrounding both pornography and homosexuality (see [[LGBT culture in India]]). However, Indian IP addresses access both lesbian and gay porn using the internet, with a 213% increase in searches for gay porn from 2013 to 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/300478/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-how-india-watches-porn-in-one-map-and-five-charts/|title=Everything you wanted to know about how India watches porn in one map and five charts|accessdate=12 November 2016}}</ref> Additionally, the most popular search for pornography amongst females in India, centers on lesbian and gay pornography.

== Violence ==
Important people in media have argued that censoring pornography would decrease rapes in India. There has not been a link between pornography being a significant factor in the rate of crime and violence in India.<ref>S.B. Math, B. Viswanath, A.S. Maroky, N.C. Kumar, A.V. Cherian, M.C. Nirmala. Sexual crime in India: is it influenced by pornography? Indian J Psychol Med, 36 (2014), pp. 147–152
</ref>  The link between pornography and sexual violence has not been observed in other countries.

== Sex work ==
Some studies have speculated that pornography influences sex work in India.<ref>Bradley, J., Rajaram, S. P., Isac, S., Gurav, K., Ramesh, B. M., Gowda, C., Moses, S., & Alary, M. (2015). Pornography, Sexual Enhancement Products and Sexual Risk of Female Sex Workers and their Clients in Southern India. ''Archives of sexual behavior'', 1-10.

Indian Journal of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS, 33(1), 9–15.</ref><ref name=":3">Beattie, T. S. H., Bradley, J. E., Vanta, U. D., Lowndes, C. M., & Alary, M. (2013).

</ref> For instance, one study of 555 female sex workers found that 45% self-reported pornographic influence driving clientele desire for anal sex.<ref name=":2" /> In another study, female sex workers reported being asked to perform new sexual acts such as anal sex, masturbation and different sex positions, requests that they believed were due to an increased exposure to pornography.<ref name=":3" /> The implications of such work is currently unclear for public health policy in India.
