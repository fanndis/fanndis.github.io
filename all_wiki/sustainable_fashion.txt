'''Sustainable fashion''' is a movement and process of fostering change to [[fashion]] products and the fashion system towards greater [[ecological integrity]] and [[social justice]]. Sustainable fashion concerns more than just addressing fashion [[Textile|textiles]] or products. It comprises addressing the whole system of fashion. This means dealing with interdependent social, cultural, ecological, and financial systems.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Sustainable fashion and textiles: design journeys (2nd ed.)|last=Fletcher|first=Kate|publisher=Earthscan|year=2008|isbn=9780415644556|location=London; Washington, DC}}</ref> Sustainable fashion also deals with considering fashion from the perspective of many stakeholders - users and producers, all living species, contemporary and future dwellers on earth. Sustainable fashion, therefore, is the responsibility of citizens, the public sector, and the private sector.

An adjacent term to sustainable fashion is '''eco fashion.'''

=== Background ===
The origins of the sustainable fashion movement are intertwined with those of the modern [[environmental movement]], and specifically the publication in 1962 of the book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by American biologist [[Rachel Carson]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Silent Spring|last=Carson|first=Rachel|publisher=Hamish Hamilton.|year=1963}}</ref> Carson's book exposed the serious and widespread pollution associated with the use of agricultural chemicals, a theme that is still important in the debate around the environmental and social impact of fashion today. The decades which followed saw the impact of human actions on the environment to be more systematically investigated, including the effects of industrial activity, and to new concepts for mitigating these effects, notably [[sustainable development]], a term coined in 1987 by the [[Our Common Future|Brundtland Report]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/693.nsf/eng/h_00019.html|title=Sustainable development – Strategic Policy Sector|last=Government of Canada|first=Innovation|website=www.ic.gc.ca|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref>

In the early 1990s and roughly coinciding with the United Nations conference on Environment and Development in 1992, popularly known as the [[Earth Summit|Rio Earth Summit]], 'green issues' (as they were called at the time) made their way into fashion and textiles publications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anon|date=1991|title=Textiles and the Environment|journal=International Textiles|volume=726|pages=40–41}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anon|date=1993|title=Rethinking Ecology|journal=Textile View|volume=24|pages=201–207}}</ref> Typically these publications featured the work of well-known companies such as [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] and [[Esprit Holdings|ESPRIT]], who in the late 1980s brought environmental concerns into their businesses. The owners of those companies at that time, [[Yvon Chouinard]] and [[Doug Tompkins]],  were outdoorsmen and witnessed the environment being harmed by over production and over consumption of material goods. They commissioned research into the impacts of fibers used in their companies. For Patagonia, this resulted in a [[Life-cycle assessment|lifecycle assessment]] for four fibers, cotton, wool, nylon and polyester. For ESPRIT the focus was on cotton—and finding better alternatives to it—which represented 90% of their business at that time. Interestingly, a similar focus on materials impact and selection is still the norm in the sustainable fashion thirty years on.<ref name=":3" />

The principles of 'green' or 'eco' fashion, as put forward by these two companies, was based on the philosophy of the deep ecologists [[Arne Næss]], [[Fritjof Capra]], and [[Ernest Callenbach]], and design theorist [[Victor Papanek]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The green imperative. Ecology and ethics in design and architecture.|last=Papanek|first=Victor|publisher=Thames and Hudson.|year=1995}}</ref> This imperative is also linked to feminist understanding of human-nature relationships, interconnectedness and “ethics of care” as advocated by [[Carolyn Merchant]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death on Nature|last=Merchant|first=Carolyn|publisher=Bravo|year=1990}}</ref> [[Suzi Gablik]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Reenchantment of Art.|last=Gablik|first=Suzi|publisher=Thames and Hudson.|year=1991}}</ref> [[Vandana Shiva]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Staying Alive|last=Shiva|first=Vandana|publisher=Zed Books|year=1989}}</ref> and [[Carol Gilligan]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=In a different voice: psychological theory and women's development|last=Gilligan|first=Carol|publisher=Harvard University Press.|year=1982}}</ref> The legacy of the early work of Patagonia and ESPRIT continues to shape the fashion industry agenda around sustainability today. They co-funded the first organic cotton conference held in 1991 in [[Visalia, California]]. And in 1992, the ESPRIT ecollection, developed by head designer [[Lynda Grose]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cenews.in/lynda-grose-pioneering-environmental-standards-for-the-clothing-industry/|title=Lynda Grose – PIONEERING ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS FOR THE CLOTHING INDUSTRY – CE NEWS|work=CE NEWS|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref> was launched at retail. The collection was based on the Eco Audit Guide, published by the Elmwood Institute. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the movement in sustainable fashion broadened to include many brands. Though the primary focus has remained on improving the impacts of products through fiber and fabric processing and material provenance, Doug Tompkins and Yvon Chouinard were early to note that exponential growth and consumption are not sustainable.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Limits to growth : a report for the Club of Rome's project on the predicament of mankind|last=Meadows, Donella H.|date=1982|publisher=Universe Books|isbn=0876631650|oclc=977611718|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/limitstogrowthr00mead}}</ref> ESPRIT placed an ad in ''[[Utne Reader]]'' in 1990 making a plea for responsible consumption. In 2011 the brand Patagonia ran an ad and a PR campaign "Don't buy this jacket" with a picture of Patagonia merchandise. This message was intended to encourage people to consider the effect that [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] has on the environment, and to purchase only what they need.

In parallel with the industry agenda, a research agenda around sustainable fashion has been in development since the early 1990s, with the field now having its own history, dynamics, politics, practices, sub-movements and evolution of analytical and critical language.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sustainable Fashion: Why Now?|editor1==Hethorn, Janet |editor2=Ulasewicz, Connie |publisher=Fairchild Books|year=2008}}</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite book|title=Shaping Sustainable Fashion|author1=Gwilt, Alison |author2=Timo Rissanen|publisher=Earthscan|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Sustainable Design|editor1=S.

=== Purpose ===
Followers of the sustainable fashion movement believe that the fashion industry has a clear opportunity to act differently, pursuing profit and growth while also creating new value and deeper wealth for society and therefore for the world economy. They believe that clothing companies ought to place environmental, social, and ethical improvements on management's agenda.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title=Pulse of The Fashion Industry|url=http://globalfashionagenda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Pulse-of-the-Fashion-Industry_2017.pdf|journal=Global Fashion Agenda}}</ref><ref name=":10">{{Cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Kate|url=https://earthlogic.info/|title=Earth Logic Fashion Action Research Plan|last2=Tham|first2=Mathilda|publisher=JJ Charitable Trust|year=2019|isbn=978-1-5272-5415-2|location=London}}</ref> The goal of sustainable fashion is to create flourishing ecosystems and communities through its activity.<ref name=":8" /> This may include: increasing the value of local production and products; prolonging the lifecycle of materials; increasing the value of timeless garments; reducing the amount of waste; and to reducing the harm to the environment created as a result of production and consumption. Another of its aims can sometimes be seen to educate people to practice environmentally friendly consumption by promoting the "green consumer".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Eco fashion|last=Brown|first=Sass|publisher=Laurence King|year=2010}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Gurova|first=Olga|last2=Morozova|first2=Daria|date=2016-09-15|title=A critical approach to sustainable fashion: Practices of clothing designers in the Kallio neighborhood of Helsinki|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|volume=18|issue=3|pages=397–413|doi=10.1177/1469540516668227|issn=1469-5405}}</ref>

There are doubts within the movement as to the effectiveness of "green consumerism." Business models based on selling more units of clothing or accessories are widely not considered to be sustainable, regardless of how "eco friendly" the garments themselves are. Thus the industry has to change its basic premise for profit, yet this is slow coming as it requires a large shift in business practices, models and tools for assessment.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ellen MacArthur Foundation|url=https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/publications/A-New-Textiles-Economy_Full-Report.pdf|title=A new textiles economy: redesigning fashion's future|publisher=Ellen MacArthur Foundation|year=2017}}</ref> This became apparent in the discussions following the Burberry report of the brand burning unsold goods worth around £28.6m (about $37.8 million) in 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fashionista.com/2018/07/burberry-burning-clothes-thredup-resale|title=Burberry Under Attack for Burning $37.8 Million Worth of Unsold Products|last=Prant|first=Dara|website=Fashionista|access-date=2019-03-12}}</ref> exposing not only overproduction and subsequent destruction of unsold stock as a normal business practice, but the behaviours amongst brands that actively undermine a sustainable fashion agenda.<ref name=":7" />

The challenge for making fashion more sustainable requires to rethink the whole system, and this call for action is in itself not new. The Union of Concerned Researchers in Fashion has argued that the industry is still discussing the same ideas as were originally mooted in the late 1980s and early 1990s. When taking the long view and examining fashion and sustainability progress since the 1990s, there are few actual advances in ecological terms. As the Union observes, "So far, the mission of sustainable fashion has been an utter failure and all small and incremental changes have been drowned by an explosive economy of extraction, consumption, waste and continuous labour abuse." <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.concernedresearchers.org/ucrf-on-2019-copenhagen-fashion-summit/|title=Statement on 2019 Copenhagen Fashion Summit|date=5 May 2019|website=Union of Concerned Researchers in Fashion}}</ref>

A frequently asked question of those working in the area of sustainable fashion is whether the field itself is an oxymoron.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Eco Chic The Fashion Paradox|last=Black|first=Sandy|publisher=Black Dog|year=2008}}</ref> This reflects the seemingly irreconcilable possibility of bringing together fashion (understood as constant change, and tied to business models based on continuous replacement of goods) and sustainability (understood as continuity and resourcefulness).<ref name=":3" /> The apparent paradox dissolves if fashion is seen more broadly, not only as a process aligned to expansionist business models,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=kate|date=2010|title=Slow Fashion: an invitation for systems change|journal=Journal of Fashion Practice|volume=2|issue=2|pages=259–266|doi=10.2752/175693810X12774625387594}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Doughnut economics : seven ways to think like a 21st-century economist|last=Raworth |first=Kate|isbn=9781847941398|oclc=1038191528|date = 2018-02-22}}</ref> and consumption of new clothing, but instead as mechanism that leads to more engaged ways of living<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gaian economics : living well within planetary limits|editor1=Dawson, Jonathan |editor2=J.

== Temporal concerns related to fashion ==
Fashion is, per definition, a phenomenon related to time: a popular expression in a certain time and context. This also affects the perception of what is and should be made more sustainable – if fashion should be "fast" or "slow" – or if it should be more exclusive or inclusive.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Hazel|date=2008-12-01|title=SLOW + FASHION—an Oxymoron—or a Promise for the Future …?|journal=Fashion Theory|volume=12|issue=4|pages=427–446|doi=10.2752/175174108X346922|issn=1362-704X}}</ref><ref name="Busch 311–327">{{Cite journal|last=Busch|first=Otto von|date=2018-09-02|title=Inclusive Fashion—an Oxymoron—or a Possibility for Sustainable Fashion?|journal=Fashion Practice|volume=10|issue=3|pages=311–327|doi=10.1080/17569370.2018.1507145|issn=1756-9370}}</ref> Like much other design, the objects of fashion exist in the interzone between desire and discard along a temporal axis, between the shimmering urge towards life and the thermodynamic fate of death. As noted by cultural theorist Brian Thill, "waste is every object, plus time."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Waste|last=Thill, Brian.|isbn=9789386606891|oclc=1066172530}}</ref>

When it comes down to the garments themselves, their durability depends on their use and "metabolism" - certain garments are made to withstand long use (ex. outdoor and hiking wear, winter jackets) whereas other garments have a quicker turn-around (ex. a party top). This means some garments have properties and a use-life that could be made more durable, whereas others should be compostable or recyclable for quicker disintegration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=Kate|date=November 2012|title=Durability, Fashion, Sustainability: The Processes and Practices of Use|journal=Fashion Practice|volume=4|issue=2|pages=221–238|doi=10.2752/175693812X13403765252389|issn=1756-9370}}</ref> Some garments age well and acquire patina and a romantic enchantment not unlike the wonder, fascination and grandeur of historical ruins, whereas the derelict and discarded rags of last season is an eyesore and nuisance; the first connotes a majesty of taste, whereas the second is the underclass of waste.

=== "Fast fashion" ===
[[File:Zara paper shopping bag, Groningen (2019) 01.jpg|thumb]]
One of the most apparent reasons for the current unsustainable condition of the fashion system is related to the temporal aspects of fashion; the continuous stream of new goods onto the market, or what is popularly called "[[fast fashion]]." The term has come to signify cheap, accessible and on-trend clothes, sourced through global production chains and sold through chains such as H&M, Zara, Forever21, etc. The 2012 book ''Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion'' by journalist Elizabeth L. Cline gives a clear introduction to the rise of disposable consumption of fashion and its impacts on the planet, the economy and consumer relationships with clothing.<ref>{{Citation|last=Cline, Elizabeth L.|title=Overdressed : the shockingly high cost of cheap fashion|date=2017|publisher=[Distributed by] OneClick Digital|isbn=978-1-5159-9679-8|oclc=1098727448}}</ref>

However, the "fast" aspect of consumption is primarily a problem to the environment when done on a massive scale. As long as fast conspicuous consumption was reserved to the rich, the global impact was not reaching public attention or seen as a problem. That is, "fast" shopping sprees of [[haute couture]] is not seen as a problem, rather it is celebrated (for example in movies such as [[Pretty Woman]]), whereas when people with less means shop fast fashion it is seen as unethical and a problem.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Busch|first=Otto von|date=2018-09-02|title=Inclusive Fashion—an Oxymoron—or a Possibility for Sustainable Fashion?|journal=Fashion Practice|volume=10|issue=3|pages=311–327|doi=10.1080/17569370.2018.1507145|issn=1756-9370}}</ref> Today, the speed of fast fashion is common across the whole industry as exclusive fashion replicates the fast fashion chains with continuous releases of collections and product drops: the quality of a garment does not necessarily translate to a slower pace of consumption and waste.

=== "Slow fashion" ===
[[Slow fashion]] can be seen as an alternative approach against [[fast fashion]], based on principles of the [[Slow Food|slow food]] movement.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Petrini, Carlo.|title=Slow food : the case for taste|date=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0-231-12845-2|oclc=56645962}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=The Official Slow Food Manifesto|date=2003-01-31|url=https://archive.org/details/slowfoodcasefort0000petr|work=Slow Food|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50237-5|access-date=2020-02-26|url-access=registration}}</ref> Characteristics of sustainable fashion match the philosophies of "[[slow fashion]]" in that emotional, ecological and ethical qualities are favored over uniform and bland convenience with minimal friction. It requires a changed infrastructure and a reduced through-put of goods. Categorically, slow fashion is neither business-as-usual nor just involving design classics. Nor is it production-as-usual but with long lead times. Slow fashion is a vision of the fashion sector built from a different starting point.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fletcher |first1=Kate |title=Slow Fashion: An Invitation for Systems Change |journal=Fashion Practice |volume=2 |date=2010 |issue=2 |pages=259–265 |doi=10.2752/175693810X12774625387594 }}</ref> Slow fashion is a fashion concept that reflects a perspective, which respects human living conditions, biological, cultural diversity and scarce global resources and creates unique, personalized products.

Slow fashion challenges growth fashion's obsession with mass-production and globalized style and becomes a guardian of diversity. It changes the power relations between fashion creators and consumers and forges new relationships and trust that are only possible at smaller scales. It fosters a heightened state of awareness of the design process and its impacts on resource flows, workers, communities, and ecosystems. <ref>Fletcher, K., & Grose, L. (2012). Fashion and sustainability: design for change. Laurence King.</ref> 

Slow fashion often consists of durable products, traditional production techniques or design concepts that strive to be season-less or last aesthetically and materially for longer periods of time. The impact of slowness aims to affect many points of the production chain. For workers in the textile industry in developing countries, slow fashion means higher wages. For end-users, slow fashion means that the goods are designed and manufactured with greater care and high-quality products. From an environmental point of view, it means that there is less clothing and industrial waste that are removed from use following transient trends.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fletcher |first1=Kate |title=Sustainable Fashion and Textiles- Design Journeys |publisher=Earthscan }}</ref> Emphasis is put on durability; emotionally, materially, aesthetically and/or through services that prolong the use-life of garments. New ideas and product innovations are constantly redefining slow fashion, so using a static, single definition would ignore the evolving nature of the concept.

Examples of stability of expression over long times are abundant in the history of dress, not least in ethnic or folk dress, ritual or coronation robes, clerical dress, or the uniforms of the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Vatican Guard]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fashion as Communication|last=Barnard|first=Malcolm|publisher=Routledge|year=2002}}</ref> The emphasis on slowness in branding is thus an approach that is specific for a niche in the market (such as Western-educated middle-class) that has since the 1990s become dominated by "fast" models. One of the earliest brands that gained global fame with an explicit focus on slow fashion, the UK brand People Tree, embraces the concept of ethical trade, manufactures all products in accordance with ethical commerce standards and supports local producers and craftsmen in developing countries. The People Tree brand is known as the first fashion to receive the World Fair Trade Organization product label in 2013, demonstrating their dedication to fair trade and the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Administrator|date=2013-07-10|title=Press Release: The WFTO Product Label Proves Fashion Is A Force For Change|url=https://wfto.com/news/press-release-wfto-product-label-proves-fashion-force-change|access-date=2020-10-31|website=World Fair Trade Organization|language=en}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=November 2020}} In addition to adopting ethical trade, the brand also prefers to use nature-friendly materials, textile products with GOTS certification and local, natural, recyclable material.

The concept of slow fashion is however not without its controversies, as the imperative of slowness is a mandate emerging from a position of privilege. To stop consuming "fast fashion" strikes against low income consumers whose only means to access trends is through cheap and accessible goods. Those who are already having a high position in society can afford to slow down and cement their status and position, while those on their way up resent being told to stay at the lower rungs of the status hierarchy. Another obstacle that the "slow fashion" paradigm is facing is related to consumers' behaviour towards the consumption of fashion and specifically clothing . In fact, sustainability conscious consumers, that usually take into account social and environmental implications of their purchases, may experience an attitude-behaviour gap preventing them to change their consumption habits when it comes to choose ethical clothing. Purchasing fashion is still perceived as an action connected to social status and it is still strongly emotionally driven.

=== Garment use and lifespan ===
The environmental impact of fashion also depends on how much and how long a garment is used. With the [[fast fashion]] trend, garments tend to be used half as much as compared to 15 years ago. This is due to the inferior quality of fabrics used but also a result of a significant increase of collections that are being released by the fashion industry. Typically, a garment used daily over years has less impact than a garment used once to then be quickly discarded. Studies have shown that the washing and drying process for pair of classic jeans is responsible for almost two-thirds of the energy consumed through the whole of the jeans' life, and for underwear about 80% of total energy use comes from laundry processes.<ref name=":3" /> Thus, use and wear practices affect the lifecycles of garments and needs to be addressed for larger systemic impact.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Adrian|date=2010|title=Review of Life Cycle Assessments of Clothing|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7398/93062680c631c755391f334901c7239f8c5c.pdf|journal=MISTRA Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research|via=Stockholm: MISTRA}}</ref>

However, there is a significant difference between making a product last from making a long-lasting product. The quality of the product must reflect the appropriate fit into its lifecycle. Certain garments of quality can be repaired and cultivated with emotional durability. Low-quality products that deteriorate rapidly are not as suitable to be "enchanted" with emotional bonds between user and product.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Emotionally durable design objects, experiences and empathy|last=Chapman, Jonathan|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315738802|oclc=1086535559}}</ref>

As highlighted in the research of Irene Maldini, slowing down (in the sense of keeping garments longer) does not necessarily translate into lower volumes of purchased units.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maldini|first=Irene|date=2019|title=From speed to volume: reframing clothing production and consumption for an environmentally sound apparel sector|journal=PLATE. Product Lifetimes and the Environment Conference Proceedings|via=PLATE 2019 Berlin}}</ref> Maldini's studies expose how slow fashion, in the sense of longer lasting use phase of garments, tends to indicate that garments stay in the wardrobe longer, stored or hoarded, but does not mean less resources are used in producing garments. Thus slowness comes to mean wardrobes with more lasting products, but the consumption volume and in-flow into the wardrobe/storage stays the same.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Maldini|first=Irene|title=Can design confront consumerism? A critical study of clothing volumes, personalization, and the wardrobe.|publisher=VU University Amsterdam|year=2019|isbn=9789083002415|location=Amsterdam}}</ref>

== Environmental concerns related to fashion ==
The textiles and fashion industries are amongst the leading industries that affect the environment negatively. One of the industries that greatly jeopardizes environmental sustainability is the textiles and fashion industry, which thus also bears great responsibilities. Globalization has made it possible to produce clothing at increasingly lower prices, prices so low, and collections shifting so fast, that many consumers consider fashion to be disposable.<ref name=":9" /> However, fast, and thus disposable, fashion adds to pollution and generates environmental hazards, in production, use and disposal.   

Putting the environmental perspective at the center, rather than the logic of the industry, is thus an urgent concern if fashion is to become more sustainable. The Earth Logic fashion research action plan argues for "putting the health and survival of our planet earth and consequently the future security and health of all species including humans, before industry, business and economic growth."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Kate|title=Earth Logic Fashion Action Research Plan.|last2=Tham|first2=Mathilda|publisher=JJ Charitable Trust.|year=2019|isbn=978-1-5272-5415-2|location=London|pages=33}}</ref> In making this argument the Earth Logic plan explicitly connects the global fashion system with the 2018 IPCC [[Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C]].  

Furthermore, the Earth Logic fashion research action plan sets out a range of possible areas for work in sustainable fashion that scientific and research evidence suggests are the most likely to deliver change of the scale and pace needed to respond to challenges like climate change. Earth Logic’s point of departure is that the planet, and its people, must be put first, before profit. It replaces the logic of economic growth, which is arguably the single largest factor limiting change towards sustainable fashion, with the logic that puts earth at its center.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Kate|url=https://earthlogic.info|title=Earth Logic Fashion Action Research Plan|last2=Tham|first2=Mathilda|publisher=JJ Charitable Trust|year=2019|location=London|pages=19}}</ref>   

=== Environmental hazards ===
The clothing industry has one of the highest impacts on the planet. High water usage, pollution from chemical treatments used in dyeing and preparation and the disposal of large amounts of unsold clothing through incineration or landfill deposits are hazardous to the environment.<ref>Citation error.

== Social concerns related to fashion ==
One of the main social issues related to fashion concerns labor. Since the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire|Triangle shirtwaist factory fire]] in 1911, labor rights in the fashion industry has been at the center of this issue.<ref>Parker, Liz “Fashion brands and worker’s rights” in Kate Fletcher & Mathilda Tham (2015) ''Routledge Handbook of Sustainability and Fashion,'' London: Routledge.</ref> The [[2013 Savar building collapse]] at Rana Plaza, where 1138 people died, put the spotlight once again on the lack of transparency, poor working conditions and hazards in fashion production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cleanclothes.org/welcome|title=Clean Clothes Campaign|last=admin|website=Clean Clothes Campaign|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maquilasolidarity.org/|title=Welcome {{!}} Maquila Solidarity Network|website=www.maquilasolidarity.org|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> Attention is increasingly being placed on labour rights violations in other parts of the whole fashion product lifecycle from textile production and processing,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antislavery.org/take-action/campaigns/end-uzbek-cotton-crimes/|title=End Uzbek Cotton Crimes|website=Anti-Slavery International|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/bangladesh-billion-dollar-leather-industry-has-problem-child-labor-and-toxic-chemicals|title=Bangladesh: Billion Dollar Leather Industry Has a Problem with Child Labor and Toxic Chemicals|date=2017-03-30|website=Pulitzer Center|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> retail and distribution<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/08/how-big-brands-including-sports-direct-unwittingly-used-slave-labour|title=How big brands including Sports Direct unwittingly used slave labour|last=Lawrence|first=Felicity|date=2017-08-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-26|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> and modelling<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.modelstrust.com/|title=Responsible Trust for Models|website=Responsible Trust for Models|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> to the recycling of textiles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lucynorris.co.uk/|title=Lucy Norris – Anthropologies of Reuse and Recycling|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> Whilst the majority of fashion and textiles are produced in Asia, Central America, Turkey, North Africa, the Caribbean and Mexico, there is still production across Europe where exploitative working conditions are also found such as in Leicester in the UK Midlands<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2015/february/new-report-published-on-working-conditions-in-leiceser-garment-sector|title=New report published on working conditions in Leicester garment sector — University of Leicester|website=www2.le.ac.uk|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> and Central and Eastern Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cleanclothes.org/livingwage/europe/intro|title=Living Wage in Eastern Europe and Turkey|date=2017|website=Clean Clothes Campaign|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>

The fashion industry benefits from racial, class and gender inequalities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The fashioned body|last=Entwistle|first=J|publisher=Polity Press|year=2000|location=Cambridge}}</ref> These inequalities and pressure from brands and retailers in the form of low prices and short lead times contribute to exploitative working conditions and low wages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/*|title=Trading Away Our Rights: Women working in global supply chains {{!}} Oxfam Policy & Practice|website=Policy & Practice|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> Also "local" production, such as garments labeled as "Made in Italy" are engaged in global sourcing of labor and worker exploitation, bypassing unions and social welfare contracts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-sweatshop-insight-idUKBRE9BS04A20131230|title=Insight – Italy's Chinese garment workshops boom as workers suffer|date=2013-12-30|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>

The number of workers employed in textiles, clothing and footwear is unknown due to the differences in statistical measures.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Working Hours in the Textiles, Clothing, Leather and Footwear Industries|last=International Labour Office, Sectoral Activities Department|publisher=ILO|year=2014|location=Geneva}}</ref> It is generally accepted that at least 25 million people, the majority women, work in garment manufacture and up to 300 million in cotton alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/Farmers-and-Workers/Cotton|title=Cotton farmers {{!}} Fairtrade Foundation|last=T: +44 (0)20 7405 5942|last2=F: +44 (0)20 7977 0101|website=www.fairtrade.org.uk|access-date=2019-02-26|last3=mail@fairtrade.org.uk|first3=E}}</ref> Nevertheless, it is really difficult to estimate exactly how many people work in the production sector, because small-scale manufacturing and contracting firms that operate illegally continue to exist within the industry. On the 24th of April 2013, Rana Plaza disaster happened as one of the biggest tragedies in history of the fashion industry. The search for the dead ended on 13 May 2013 with a death toll of 1,134. Approximately 2,500 injured people were rescued from the building alive. It is considered the deadliest garment-factory disaster in history, as well as the deadliest structural failure in modern human history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bangladesh factory collapse toll passes 1,000 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22476774 |website=BBC |access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref>

The environmental impact of fashion also affects communities located close to production sites. There is little easily accessible information about these impacts, but it is known that water and land pollution from toxic chemicals used to produce and dye fabrics and have serious negative consequences for the people living near factories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://changingmarkets.org/portfolio/dirty-fashion/|title=Dirty fashion|website=Changing Markets|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> At the global level, fashion is contributing to climate change and threatens biodiversity, which have social consequences for everyone.

=== Transparency ===
Supply chain transparency has been a recurring controversy for the fashion industry, not least since the Rana Plaza accident. The issue has been pushed by many labor organizations, not least Clean Clothes Campaign and [[Fashion Revolution]]. Over the last years, over 150 major brands including Everlane, Filippa K and H&M have answered by publicizing information about their factories online. Every year, Fashion Revolution publishes a Fashion Transparency Index <ref>{{Cite news|last=Marriott|first=Hannah|date=2020-04-20|title=H&M tops 2020 fashion transparency index as 10 brands score zero|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/21/hm-tops-2020-fashion-transparency-index-as-10-brands-score-zero|access-date=2020-07-22|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/apr/24/the-fashion-transparency-index-2019-report-ranks-worlds-biggest-brands The Fashion Transparency Index: 2019 report ranks world's biggest brands | Fashion | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> which rates the world's largest brands and retailers according to how much information they disclose about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices, and social and environmental impact. The top scorers of the 2019 Fashion Transparency Index included [[Adidas]], [[Reebok]], [[Patagonia, Inc.|Patagonia]], and [[H&M]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fashion Transparency Index 2019|url=https://issuu.com/fashionrevolution/docs/fashion_transparency_index_2019|access-date=2020-10-31|website=Issuu|language=en}}</ref>

However, the focus on transparency and traceability has so far not shown the promise expected. Even if a consumer can find information on the clothing label, such as the address of the factory and how many people work there, it says nothing about the salaries and living conditions of the workers, the factory's subcontracting practices, or the environmental impact of sourcing and production. The focus on transparency has so far not bridged information with systemic action and impact. While the agenda of transparency is honourable and important, it is toothless if not paired with real improvements, policy change and legal action which holds corporations and factories responsible for misconduct.

=== Diversity and inclusion ===
In addition, fashion companies are criticised for the lack of size, age, physical ability, gender and racial diversity of models used in photo shoots and catwalks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/786015-runway-diversity-report-fall-2018/|title=Diversity Report: The Fall 2018 Runways Were the Most Race and Transgender-Inclusive Ever; Not So Much for Age and Size Diversity|date=2018-03-22|website=theFashionSpot|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> A more radical and systemic critique of social inequality in fashion concerns the exclusion and aesthetic supremacy inherent and accentuated through fashion that still remains unquestioned under the current environmentally focused discourse on sustainable fashion.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A typology of fashion violence|last=Von Busch|first=Otto|last2=Bjereld|first2=Ylva|date=2016-06-01|journal=Critical Studies in Fashion & Beauty|volume=7|pages=89–107|doi=10.1386/csfb.7.1.89_1}}</ref><ref name="Busch 311–327" />

It is worth noticing that while social "inclusivity" has become almost a norm amongst brands marketing ethical and sustainable fashion, the norm for what is considered a "beautiful" and "healthy" body keeps narrowing down under what researchers have called the current "wellness syndrome."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wellness Syndrome|last=Cederström, Carl|date=2015|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780745688718|oclc=956676547}}</ref> With the positive thinking of inclusivity, the assumption is that you can be whatever you want to be, and thus if you are not living up to the ideals it is your own fault. This optimism hides the diktat of aesthetic wellness, which turns inclusion into an obligation to look good and be dressed in fashionable clothes, a "democratic" demand for aesthetic as well as ethical perfection, as argued by philosopher Heather Widdows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Perfect Me|last=Widdows|first=Heather|date=2018-12-31|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400889624|location=Princeton|doi = 10.23943/9781400889624}}</ref>

== Global concerns related to fashion ==
The impact of fashion across the planet is unevenly distributed. Whereas much of the benefits of cheap and accessible clothes targets and benefits the socially mobile classes in metropolitan areas in the [[North–South divide in the World|Global North]], developing countries take a much proportion of the negative impact from the fashion system in terms of waste, pollution, and ecological injustices.

The current focus on solutions related to "[[Waste hierarchy|reduce, reuse, recycle]]," which are primarily promoted through brand initiatives, fails to address the global impact of the fashion system. Not only does it push responsibility for systemic issues onto the individual, but it also primarily positions fashion in a Western consumerism context, and puts Euro-centric models of status, individualism, and consumerism as universal models for social life and aspirations.

== Economic concerns related to fashion ==
At the heart of the controversy concerning "fast fashion" lies the acknowledgement that the "problem" of unsustainable fashion is that cheap, accessible and on-trend clothes have become available to people of poorer means. This means more people across the world have adopted the consumption habits that in the mid-twentieth century were still reserved for the rich. To put it differently, the economic concern of fashion is that [[poor]] people now have access to updating their wardrobes as often as the rich. That is, "fast" fashion is only a problem when poor people engage in it. In alignment with this, blame is often put on poor consumers; they don't buy quality goods, buy too much and too cheap, etc.

The economic concerns of fashion also means many of the sustainable "solutions" to fashion, such as buying high-quality goods to last longer, are not accessible to people with less means. From an economic perspective, sustainability thus remains a moralizing issue of educated classes teaching the less educated "responsible consumption," and a debate that mainly concerns promoting frugality and austerity to those with less means. It is seen as an opportunity by businesses that allow resale of luxury goods. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://wtvox.com/sustainable-fashion/renting-luxury-fashion|title=Renting Luxury Fashion – Just A Technology-Driven Trend?}}</ref>

The distribution of value within the fashion industry is another economic concern, with garment workers and textile farmers and workers receiving low wages and prices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/Farmers-and-Workers/Cotton|title=Cotton farmers {{!}} Fairtrade Foundation|website=www.fairtrade.org.uk|access-date=2019-02-26|last3=mail@fairtrade.org.uk|first3=E}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cleanclothes.org/livingwage/living-wage|title=Living Wage|website=Clean Clothes Campaign|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>

== Sustainable clothing ==
'''Sustainable clothing refers to fabrics derived from eco-friendly resources, such as sustainably grown [[fiber crop]]s or recycled materials. It also refers to how these fabrics are made. Historically, being environmentally conscious towards clothing meant (1) buying clothes from [[thrift store]]s or any shops that sell [[Second-hand clothes|second-hand clothing]], or (2) donating used clothes to shops previously mentioned, for reuse or resale. In modern times, with a prominent trend towards [[sustainability]] and being ‘green’, sustainable clothing has  expanded towards (1) reducing the amount of clothing discarded to landfills, and (2) decreasing the environmental impact of agro-chemicals in producing conventional fiber crops (e.g. cotton).'''
[[File:Sustainable_development.svg|thumb|The "three pillars" of sustainability bounded by the environment (earth, life)]]
Under the accordance of sustainability, recycled clothing upholds the principle of the "Three R’s of the Environment": [[Waste hierarchy|Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle]], as well as the "Three Legs of Sustainability": Economics, Ecology, and Social Equity.

Through the utilization of recycled material for the manufacturing of clothing, this provides an additional realm of economic world profit. Sustainable Clothing will provide a new market for additional job opportunities, continuous net flow of money in the global economy, and the consumption reduction of raw materials and virgin resources. Source reduction or reducing the use of raw materials and virgin resources can ultimately reduce carbon emissions during the manufacturing process as well as the resources and carbon emissions that are related to the transportation process. This also prevents the unsustainable usage of extracting materials from the Earth by making use of what has already been used (i.e. recycling).

== Recycled clothing ==
{{see also|Global trade of secondhand clothing}}
{{see also|Circular economy#Textile industry}}

Recycled or reclaimed fibres are recovered from either pre or post-consumer sources. Those falling into the category of 'pre-consumer' are unworn/unused textile wastes from all the various stages of manufacture. Post-consumer textile waste could be any product which has been worn/used and have (typically) been discarded or donated to charities. Once sorted for quality and colour, they can be shredded (pulled, UK or picked, US) into a fibrous state. According to the specification and end use, these fibres can be blended together or with 'new' fibre.

While most textiles can be recycled, in the main they are downgraded almost immediately into low-quality end-uses, such as filling materials. The limited range of recycled materials available reflects the market dominance of cheap virgin fibres and the lack of technological innovation in the recycling industry. For over 200 years recycling technology has stayed the same; fibres are extracted from used fabric by mechanically tearing the fabric apart using carding machines. The process breaks the fibres, producing much shorter lengths that tend to result in a low quality yarn. Textiles made from synthetic fibres can also be recycled chemically in a process that involves breaking down the fibre at the molecular level and then repolymerizing the feedstock. While chemical recycling is more energy intensive than mechanical pulling, the resulting fibre tends to be of more predictable quality. The most commonly available recycled synthetic fibre is polyester made from plastic bottles, although recycled nylon is also available<ref>{{cite book|title=Sustainable fashion and textiles design journeys|last1=Fletcher|first1=Kate|publisher=Earthscan|isbn=9781849772778}}</ref>

In addition to promoting a sounder environment by producing newer clothing made with sustainable, innovative materials, clothing can also be donated to charities, sold into consignment shops, or recycled into other materials. These methods reduce the amount of landfill space occupied by discarded clothes. According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s 2008 Report on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States defines clothing as non-durable&nbsp;– generally lasts less than three years&nbsp;– textiles. In 2008, approximately 8.78&nbsp;millions of tons of textiles were generated, 1.45&nbsp;millions of tons were recovered and saved from landfills resulting in a rate of almost 17%. The EPA report also states that the amount of MSW being "Discarded" is 54%, "Recovered" is 33%, and "Combusted with [[Energy recovery]]" is 13%.<ref name="EPA">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw//nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw2008rpt.pdf|title=Municipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States: Facts and Figures for 2008|date=November 2009|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> Approximately two-thirds of clothing materials are sent to landfills, making it the fastest growing component of waste in the household waste stream. {{Asof|2009}}, textiles disposed of in landfill sites have risen from 7% to 30% within the last five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.org/green_green_living/clothing/268798/whats_the_most_sustainable_fabric.html|title=What's the Most Sustainable Fabric|last=Lee|first=Matilda|date=6 February 2009|work=[[The Ecologist]]}}</ref><gallery>

=== Upcycling ===
Upcycling in fashion signifies the process of reusing the unwanted and discarded materials (ex. fabric scraps or clothes) into new materials or products without compromising the value and the quality of the used material. In order to implement the upcycling method, it is important to have an overview of the textile waste available because this is what dictates the garment that can be created. Using upcycling in fashion design emphasizes the importance of a local approach. Thus, both the input material (waste) and the production ideally should be local. Since levels of waste production and volumes of waste can differ by region, the first step to collecting materials for upcycling is to carry out a local textile waste study.  The definition of textile waste can be production waste, pre-consumer waste, and post-consumer waste.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/runnel/docs/reet-aus|title=Trash to Trend|last1=Aus|first1=Reet|website=Issuu|access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref>

Typically, upcycling creates something new and better from the old or used or disposed items. The process of upcycling requires a blend of factors like environmental awareness, creativity, innovation and hard work and results in a unique sustainable product. Upcycling aims at the development of products truly sustainable, affordable, innovative and creative. For example, downcycling produces cleaning rags from worn T-shirts, whereas upcycling recreates the shirts into a value-added product like unique handmade braided rug.<ref>{{cite book|title=Textiles and clothing sustainability: recycled and upcycled textiles and fashion|last1=Muthu|first1=Subramanian Senthilkannan|date=2016-08-06|isbn=9789811021466}}</ref> 

Upcycling can be seen as one of the waste management strategies. There are different types of strategies. From least to most resource-intensive, the strategies are the reuse of product, repairing and reconditioning to keep products as long as possible, recycling the raw materials.<ref name=autogenerated1>Fletcher, K. (2013). Sustainable fashion and textiles: design journeys. Routledge.</ref> The reuse of textile products 'as is' brings significant environmental savings. In the case of clothing, the energy used to collect, sort and resell second-hand garments in between 10 and 20 times less than that needed to make a new item.<ref>Laursen, S. E., Hansen, J., Bagh, J., Jensen, O. K., & Werther, I. (1997). Environmental assessment of textiles. Environmental project, (369).</ref>

It is meant to be innovative by making certain materials into something re-usable and improved, which gives companies and manufacturers higher values for their products. Recycling is a big factor to sustainability, so creating new materials to avoid mass pollution can help improve the economy. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zimring|first=Carl A.|date=2016|title=Upcycling in History: Is the Past a Prologue to a Zero-Waste Future? The Case of Aluminum|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26241375|journal=RCC Perspectives|issue=3|pages=45–52|issn=2190-5088}}</ref>An example of a brand that does this is Ecoalf. All clothing items are made from recycled items like used tires and plastic bottles. The manufacturing of their items also takes place wherever the materials are recycled from, ultimately reducing their [[carbon footprint]]

== Sustainable consumption practices for enhanced product life ==
There are negative social and environmental impacts at all stages of the fashion product life: materials production and processing, manufacture of garments, retail and marketing, use and maintenance and at the discard phase. For some products, the environmental impact can be greater at the use phase than material production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/insights/sustainability/well-dressed/|title=Well dressed?

===Consumer engagement===

Consumer engagement challenges the "passive" mode of ready-to-wear fashion where consumers have few interfaces and little incentive to be active with their garments; to repair, change, update, swap, and learn from their wardrobe.<ref name=":4" /> The term "folk fashion" has been used in the emphasis on craft engagements with garments where the community heritage of skills are in focus.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Folk fashion.

Notions of [[participatory design]], [[open source]]<nowiki/>fashion, and fashion [[Hacker culture|hacktivism]] are parts of such endeavors, mixing techniques of dissemination with empowerment, reenechantment and [[Paulo Freire]]'s "[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]."<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":6">{{Cite book|title=Zero waste fashion design|last=Rissanen, Timo|isbn=978-1350094833|oclc=1040994499|date=2018-09-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Fashion-able : hacktivism and engaged fashion design|last=Busch |first=Otto von|date=2009|publisher=Camino|isbn=9789197841108|oclc=703595835}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Black|first=S. |display-authors=etal|date=2009|title=Considerate Design for Personalized Fashion: Towards Sustainable Fashion Design and Consumption|journal=Mass Matching - Customization, Configuration & Creativity: Proceedings of the MCPC 2009|via=Helsinki, Aalto University School of Art and Design}}</ref> An example of such consumer engagement can be Giana Gonzalez and her project "[http://www.hackingcouture.com Hacking Couture]" which has tested such methods across the world since 2006.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Busch|first=Otto von|date=2014|title=Fashion Hacking|journal=Design as Future-Making|doi=10.5040/9781474293907-0009|isbn=9781474293907}}</ref> As highlighted in the research of Jennifer Ballie, there is also an increasing interest across industry to produce unique experiences amongst users, connecting co-design with social media apps and tools to enhance the user experience of consumers.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ballie|first=Jennifer|title=e􏰅Co-Textile Design: How can textile design and making, combined with social media tools, achieve a more sustainable fast fashion future?|publisher=University of the Arts London.|year=2014|location=London}}</ref>

Enhancing the lifespan of products have been yet another approach to sustainability, yet still only in its infancy. Upmarket brands have long supported the lifespan of their products through [[product-service system]]s, such as re-waxing of classic outdoor jackets, or repairs of expensive hand-bags, yet more accessible brands do still not offer even spare buttons in their garments. One such approach concerns [[emotionally durable design]], yet with fashion's dependency on continuous updates, and consumer's desire to follow trends, there is a significant challenge to make garments last long through emotional attachment. As with memories, not all are pleasant, and thus a focus on emotional attachment can result in favoring a normative approach to what is considered a good enough memory to manifest emotionally in a garment. Cultural theorist Peter Stallybrass approaches this challenge in his essay on poverty, textile memory, and the coat of Karl Marx.<ref>{{Cite book|title="Marx' Coat" essay, in Border fetishisms : material objects in unstable spaces|last1=Peter |first1=Stallybrass|editor=Spyer, Patricia |date=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415918561|oclc=37024820}}</ref>

=== Clothing swapping ===
{{Main|Clothing swap}}
Clothing swapping can further promote the reduction, reuse, and recycling of clothing. By reusing clothing that's already been made and recycling clothing from one owner to another, source reduction can be achieved. This moves away from usage of new raw materials to make more clothing available for consumption. Through the method of clothing swapping, an alternative resource for consumers to ultimately save in regards to money and time is provided. It reduces transportation emissions, costs, and the time it takes to drive and search through the chaos of most clothing stores. Swapping clothes further promotes the use of sustainable [[online shopping]] and the internet as well as an increase of social bonds through online communication or effective personal communication in "clothing swap parties." The EPA states, that by reusing items, at the source waste can be diverted from ending up in landfills because it delays or avoids that item's entry in the waste collection and disposal system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/reduce.htm|title=Reduce & Reuse|date=17 November 2009|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>

== Sustainable clothing through charities ==
{{Main|Charitable organization}}
People can opt to donate clothing to charities. In the UK, a charity is a [[non-profit organization]] that is given special tax form and distinct legal status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charityfacts.org/charity_facts/index.html|title=What is a Charity?|year=2010|publisher=Charity Facts|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> A charity is "a foundation created to promote the public good".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=charity|title=charity|publisher=[[Word Net]] – 3.1|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>  People donating clothing to charitable organizations in America are often eligible for [[tax deductions]], albeit the donations are [[itemized]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taxes.about.com/od/deductionscredits/a/CharityDonation.htm|title=Tax Deduction for Charity Donations|last=Perez|first=William|date=16 August 2010|publisher=[[About.com]]}}</ref>

=== Clothing donations ===
Generally, [[charitable organizations]] often sell donated clothing rather than directly giving the clothing away. Charities keep 10% of donated clothing for their high quality and retail value for the thrift shops.<ref name="abc">{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2743456&page=1|title=The Truth About Where Your Donated Clothes End Up|last=Lee|first=Mike|date=21 December 2006|publisher=[[ABC News]]|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> Charities sell the rest of the donations to [[textile recycling]] businesses.<ref name="abc" />

=== Controversy ===
There are "charities" that are actually for-profit organizations. These organizations are often multibillion-dollar firms that keep profits accrued from selling donated clothing.<ref name="profit">{{cite web|url=http://www.moneyunder30.com/donating-clothing-beware-for-profit-drop-boxes|title=Donating Clothing? Beware For-Profit Drop Boxes|last=Weliver|first=David|date=16 July 2008|publisher=moneyunder30.com|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> Monetary donations are given for public goodwill, but only at relatively few percentages.<ref name="profit" /> For example, [[Planet Aid]], a supposedly non-profit organization that collects donated clothing, reportedly gives only 11% of its total income to charities.<ref name="profit" /> Such organizations often use [[Clothing bin|drop-off boxes]] to collect clothes. These drop-off boxes look similar to their non-profit counterparts, which mislead the public into donating their clothes to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2010/10/goodwill_warns_fake_donation_b.html|title=Goodwill warns fake donation bin scam is feeding 'billion-dollar for-profit industry'|last=Bauer|first=Julia|date=16 October 2010|work=The Grand Rapids Press|publisher=mlive.com|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> Such public deception prompted backlash, one example where a mayor called for the city's removal of for-profit clothing donation bins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirotv.com/news/21727639/detail.html|title=Mayor Calls For Removal Of For-Profit Clothing Donation Bins|last=Halsne|first=Chris|date=25 November 2009|publisher=kirotv.com|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> To search for reputable charities, see [[Charity Navigator]]'s website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/|title=Find a Charity You Can Trust|year=2010|publisher=Charity Navigator|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>

=== Consignment ===
{{Main|Consignment}}
In [[layman]]’s terms, a clothing consignment shop sells clothes that are owned not by the shop’s owner but by the individual who had given (or consigned) the items to the shop for the owner to sell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inventoryops.com/ConsignmentInventory.htm|title=Consignment Inventory: What is it and When Does It Make Sense to Use It|last=Piasecki|first=Dave|year=2004|publisher=inventoryops.com|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> The shop owner/seller is the [[consignee]] and the owner of the items is the [[consignor]]. Both the consignor and the consignee receive portions of the profit made from the item. However, the consignor will not be paid until the items are sold. Therefore, unlike donating clothing to charities, people who consign their clothes to shops can make profit.

=== Textile recycling ===
{{Main|Textile recycling}}
According to an ABC News report, charities keep approximately 10% of all the donated clothing received.<ref name="abc" />  These clothes tend to be good quality, fashionable, and high valued fabrics that can easily be sold in charities’ thrift shops. Charities sell the other 90% of the clothing donations to textile recycling firms.<ref name="abc" />

Textile recycling firms process about 70% of the donated clothing into industrial items such as rags or cleaning cloths.<ref name="abc" /> However, 20–25% of the [[second-hand]] clothing is sold into an international market.<ref name="abc" />  Where possible, used jeans collected from America, for example, are sold to low-income customers in Africa for modest prices, yet most end up in landfill as the average US sized customer is several sizes bigger than the global average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gciatl.com/media.html|title=Your Cast-Offs, Their Profits: Items donated to Goodwill and Salvation Army often end up as part of a $1 billion-a-year used-clothing business|last=Chapman|first=Dan|date=24 December 2006|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|publisher=gciatl.com|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>

==Sustainable fashion organisations and companies==
There is a broad range of organisations purporting to support sustainable fashion, some representing particular stakeholders, some addressing particular issues, and some seeking to increase the visibility of the sustainable fashion movement. They also range from the local to global. It is important to examine the interests and priorities of the organisations.

=== Organizations ===

== Materials ==

There are many factors when considering the [[sustainability]] of a material. The renewability and source of a [[fiber]], the process of how a raw fiber is turned into a [[textile]], the impact of preparation and dyeing of the fibers, energy use in production and preparation, the [[working conditions]] of the people producing the materials, and the material's total [[carbon footprint]], transportation between production plants, chemicals used to keep shipments fresh in containers, shipping to retail and consumer, how the material will be cared for and washed, the processes of repairs and updates, and what happens to it at the end of life. The indexing of the textile journeys is thus extremely complex. In sustainability, there is no such thing as a single-frame approach. Issues dealt with in single frames will almost by definition lead to unwanted and unforeseen effects elsewhere. <ref name=autogenerated1 />

Overall, diversity in the overall fiber mix is needed; in 2013 cotton and polyester accounted for almost 85% of all fibers, and thus their impacts were, and continue to be, disproportionately magnified.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sustainable fashion and textiles : design journeys|last=1971–|first=Fletcher, Kate|year=2014|isbn=9780415644556|edition=Second|location=London|oclc=846847018}}</ref> Also, many fibers in the finished garments are mixed to acquire desired drape, flexibility or stretch, thus affecting both care and the possibility to recycle the material in the end.

===Cellulose fibers===
Natural fibers are fibers which are found in [[nature]] and are not petroleum-based. Natural fibers can be categorized into two main groups, [[cellulose]] or [[plant fiber]] and [[protein]] or [[animal fiber]]. Uses of these fibers can be anything from buttons to eyewear such as sunglasses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cefashion.net/go-wood-sunglasses-for-a-new-wave|title=Go wood: sunglasses for sustainable living|last=Capulet|first=Ian|date=12 February 2015|website=CEFashion.net|access-date=9 December 2015}}</ref>

Other than cotton, the most common plant-based fiber, [[cellulose]] fibers include: [[jute]], [[flax]], [[hemp]], [[ramie]], [[abaca]], [[bamboo]] (used for [[viscose]]), [[soy]], [[corn]], [[banana]], [[pineapple]], [[beechwood]] (used for [[rayon]]). Alternative fibers such as bamboo (in yarn) and hemp (of a variety that produces only a tiny amount of the psychoactive component found in cannabis) are coming into greater use in so-called eco-fashions.<ref name=":2" />

==== Cotton ====
{{Main|Cotton}}
Cotton, also known as vegetable wool, is a major source of apparel fiber. Celebrated for its excellent absorbency, durability, and intrinsic softness, cotton accounts for over 50% of all clothing produced worldwide. This makes cotton the most widely used clothing fiber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://knol.google.com/k/cotton-fabric#|title=Cotton Fabric|year=2009|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> [[Cotton]] is one of the most chemical-intensive crops in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecotton.org/html/who_we_are.html|title=Sustainable Cotton Project: Who we are|website=Sustainablecotton.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214090311/http://www.sustainablecotton.org/html/who_we_are.html|archive-date=14 February 2005|access-date=19 May 2012}}</ref> Conventionally grown cotton uses approximately 25% of the world's [[insecticides]] and more than 10% of the world's [[pesticides]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.organicitsworthit.org/get/cotton-and-environment|title=Cotton and the environment|publisher=[[Organic Trade Association]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416011200/http://www.organicitsworthit.org/get/cotton-and-environment|archive-date=16 April 2015|access-date=9 December 2015}}</ref> However, growing and processing this particular fiber crop is largely unsustainable. For every pound of cotton harvested, a farmer uses up 1/3&nbsp;lb of chemical, synthetic fertilizer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sayitgreen.com/organic/fairtrade.html|title=Your Grandkids Will Thank You|date=6 April 2009|publisher=sayitgreen.com|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>  As a whole, the US cotton production makes up 25% of all pesticides deployed in the United States. Worldwide, cotton takes up 2.4% of all arable lands yet requires 16% of the world's pesticides.<ref name="organic">{{cite web|url=http://www.ota.com/organic/environment/cotton_environment.html|title=Cotton and the Environment|year=2009|publisher=Organic Trade Association|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>  Furthermore, the cotton hulls contain the most potent insecticide residues. They are often used as cattle feed, which means that consumers are purchasing meat containing a concentration of pesticides.<ref name="organic" /> The processing of cotton into usable fibers also adds to the burden on the environment. Manufacturers prefer cotton to be white so that cotton can easily be synthetically dyed to any shade of color.<ref name="peruna">{{cite web|url=http://www.perunaturtex.com/scientif.htm|title=The Revival of Colored Cotton|last=Vreeland Jr.|first=James M.|date=April 1999|work=[[Scientific American]]|publisher=perunaturtex.com|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> Natural cotton is actual beige brown, and so during processing, manufacturers would add bleach and various other chemicals and heavy metal dyes to make cotton pure white.<ref name="savvy">{{cite web|url=http://savvybrown.com/health/whats-the-problem-with-cotton-part-1/|title=What's the Problem With Cotton?

===== Bt cotton =====
{{Main|Bt cotton}}
To reduce the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals, companies have produced [[genetically modified]] (GMO) cottons plants that are resistant to pest infestations. Among the GMO are cotton crops inserted with the Bt (''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'') gene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.ucsd.edu/gmo.html|title=Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO)|publisher=University of San Diego|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> [[Bt cotton]] crops do not require insecticide applications. Insects that consume cotton containing Bt will stop feeding after a few hours, and die, leaving the cotton plants unharmed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.ucsd.edu/how_bt_work.html|title=How Does Bt Work?|publisher=University of San Diego|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>

As a result of the use of Bt cotton, the cost of pesticide applications decreased between $25 and $65 per acre.<ref name="bt">{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.ucsd.edu/bt_cotton.html|title=Bt Cotton Data|publisher=University of San Diego|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>  Bt cotton crops yield 5% more cotton on average compared to traditional cotton crops.<ref name="bt" />  Bt crops also lower the price of cotton by 0.8&nbsp;cents per pound.<ref name="bt" />

However, there are concerns regarding Bt technology, mainly that insects will eventually develop resistance to the Bt strain. According to an article published in Science Daily, researchers have found that members from a cotton bollworm species, ''[[Helicoverpa zea]]'', were Bt resistant in some crop areas of Mississippi and Arkansas during 2003 and 2006.<ref name="science">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080207140803.htm|title=First Documented Case Of Pest Resistance To Biotech Cotton|date=8 February 2008|publisher=Science Daily|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> Fortunately, the vast majority of other agricultural pests remain susceptible to Bt.<ref name="science" />

Micha Peled's documentary exposé [[Bitter seeds]] on BT farming in [[India]] reveals the true impact of genetically modified cotton on India's farmers, with a suicide rate of over a quarter million Bt cotton farmers since 1995 due to financial stress resulting from massive crop failure and the exorbitantly high price of Monsanto's proprietary BT seed.  The film also refutes false claims purported by the biotech industry that Bt cotton requires less pesticide and empty promises of higher yields, as farmers discover the bitter truth that in reality Bt cotton in fact requires a great deal more pesticide than organic cotton, and often suffer higher levels of infestation by [[Mealybug]] resulting in devastating crop losses, and extreme financial and psychological stress on cotton farmers.  Due to the biotech seed monopoly in India, where Bt cotton seed has become the ubiquitous standard, and organic seed has become absolutely unobtainable, thus coercing all cotton farmers into signing Bt cotton seed purchase agreements which enforce the intellectual property interests of the biotech [[multinational corporation]] [[Monsanto]].<ref>url=http://www.itvs.org/films/bitter-seeds</ref>

===== Organic cotton =====
{{Main|Organic cotton}}

Organic cotton is grown without the use of any genetically modification to the crops, without the use of any fertilizers, pesticides, and other synthetic agro-chemicals harmful to the land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vineyardteam.org/resources/sustainableag.php|title=Sustainable Ag Q & A|publisher=Central Coast Vineyard Team|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> All cotton marketed as organic in the United States is required to fulfill strict federal regulations regarding how the cotton is grown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3003494&acct=noprulemaking|title=Production and Handling&nbsp;– Preamble|publisher=USDA|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> This is done with a combination of innovation, science and tradition in order to encourage a good quality of life and environment for all involved. <ref>

===== Naturally colored cotton =====
{{Main|Naturally colored cotton}}

Cotton is naturally grown in varieties of colors. Typically, cotton color can come as mauve, red, yellow, and orange hues.<ref name="peruna" /> The use of naturally colored cotton has long been historically suppressed, mainly due to the industrial revolution.<ref name="peruna" />  Back then, it was much cheaper to have uniformly white cotton as a raw source for mass-producing cloth and fabric items.<ref name="peruna" />  Currently, modern markets have revived a trend in using naturally colored cotton for its noted relevance in reducing harmful environmental impacts. One such example of markets opening to these cotton types would be Sally Fox and her Foxfiber business—naturally colored cotton that Fox has bred and marketed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vreseis.com/|title=Vreisis Ltd.|publisher=Vreisis Ltd.|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>  On an additional note, naturally colored cotton is already colored, and thus do not require synthetic dyes during process. Furthermore, the color of fabrics made from naturally colored cotton does not become worn and fade away compared to synthetically dyed cotton fabrics.<ref>{{citation|last1=Dickerson|first=Dianne K.|title=Naturally Colored Cotton: Resistance to changes in color and durability when refurbished with selected laundry aids|date=October 1999|url=http://cati.csufresno.edu/ip/rese/99/990901.pdf|page=5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719181721/http://cati.csufresno.edu/ip/rese/99/990901.pdf|url-status=dead|publisher=California Agricultural Technology Institute|access-date=7 December 2010|archive-date=19 July 2011|last2=Lane|first2=Eric|last3=Rodriguez|first3=Dolores}}</ref>[[File:Organiccotton.jpg|[[Organic cotton]] yarn|thumb]]<br />

==== Soy ====
{{Main|Soy}}

Soy fabrics are derived from the hulls of soybeans—a manufacturing byproduct. Soy fabrics can be blended (i.e. 30%) or made entirely out of soy fibers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.natural-living-for-women.com/soy-clothing.html|title=Soy Clothing: The Latest In Eco-Friendly Style|year=2010|publisher=Natural Living for Women|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> Soy clothing is largely [[biodegradable]], so it has a minimal impact on environment and [[landfills]].

==== Hemp ====
{{Main|Hemp}}
Hemp, like bamboo, is considered a sustainable crop. It requires little water to grow, and it is resistant to most pests and diseases.<ref name="earth">{{cite web|url=http://eartheasy.com/wear_hemp_clothing.htm|title=Hemp Clothing|year=2010|publisher=eartheasy.com|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> The hemp plant's broad leaves shade out weeds and other plant competitors, and its deep taproot system allows it to draw moisture deep in the soil.<ref name="bin">{{cite web|url=http://www.binhaitimes.com/hemp.html|title=Hemp Fibres|publisher=Natural Fibers|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>  Unlike cotton, many parts of the hemp plant have a use. Hemp seeds, for example, are processed into oil or food.<ref name="earth" />  Hemp fiber comes in two types: primary and secondary [[bast fiber]]s. Hemp fibers are durable and are considered strong enough for construction uses.<ref name="bin" /> Compared to cotton fiber, hemp fiber is approximately 8 times the tensile strength and 4 times the durability.<ref name="bin" />

Hemp fibers are traditionally coarse, and have been historically used for ropes rather than for clothing. However, modern technology and breeding practices have made hemp fiber more pliable, softer, and finer.<gallery>

==== Bamboo ====
{{Main|Bamboo}}

Bamboo fabrics are made from heavily pulped bamboo grass.  Making clothing and textile from bamboo is considered sustainable due to the lack of need for pesticides and agrochemicals.<ref name="versus">{{cite web|url=http://www.d6clothing.com/d6/green-info-bamboo-vs-cotton/|title=Bamboo vs. Cotton|year=2010|publisher=D6 Clothing|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>  Naturally disease and pest resistant, bamboo is also fast growing. Compared to trees, certain varieties of bamboo can grow 1–4&nbsp;inches long per day, and can even branch and expand outward because of its underground rhizomes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.natural-living-for-women.com/bamboo-clothing.html|title=Bamboo Clothing: A new choice in eco-fashion|year=2010|publisher=Natural Living for Women|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> Like cotton fibers, bamboo fibers are naturally yellowish in color and are bleached white with chemicals during processing.<gallery>

==== Kombucha (SCOBY) ====
{{main|SCOBY}}
Burnished by a grant from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US. Environmental Protection Agency]], associate professor Young-A Lee and her team are growing vats of gel-like film composed of [[Cellulose fiber|cellulose]] fiber, a byproduct of the same symbiotic colonies of bacteria and yeast (abbreviated [[SCOBY]]) found in another of the world's popular "live culture" foods: [[kombucha]]. Once harvested and dried, the resulting material has a look and feel much like leather.<ref name=":03">{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2016/04/26/sustainableclothing|title=Clothing made from tea byproduct could improve health of fashion industry|date=April 2016|website=Iowa State University|publisher=Iowa State University}}</ref> The fibres are 100 percent [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]], they also foster a [[Cradle-to-cradle design|cradle-to-cradle]] cycle of reuse and regeneration that leaves behind virtually zero waste. However, this material takes a long time to grow about three to four weeks under lab-controlled conditions. Hence mass production is an issue. In addition, tests revealed that moisture absorption from the air softens this material makes it less durable. Researchers also discovered that cold conditions make it brittle.<ref name=":03" />

==== Other cellulose fibers ====
Other alternative biodegradable fibers being developed by small companies include:

* leather alternative using pineapple leaves;<ref name="ecowatch">{{cite web|url=https://www.ecowatch.com/look-out-cotton-these-3-fruits-are-shaking-up-the-textile-industry-1882021787.html|title=Look Out Cotton, These 3 Fruits Are Shaking Up the Textile Industry|date=12 March 2015|access-date=18 January 2019}}</ref>

* fabric and paper made from banana plant stalks and stems.<ref name="ecowatch" />

===Protein fibers===
Protein fibers originate from animal sources and are made up of protein molecules. The basic elements in these protein molecules being carbon, hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bieap.gov.in/Pdf/CGTPaperII.pdf|title=Classification and general properties of textile fibres|last=Haung|first=HC|date=1994|access-date=March 1, 2018}}</ref> Natural protein fibers include: [[wool]], [[silk]], [[Angora wool|angora]], [[camel]], [[alpaca]], [[llama]], [[vicuna]], [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]], and [[mohair]].
==== Wool ====
Just as in cotton production, pesticides are used in the cultivation of wool, although quantities are considerably smaller and it is thought that good practice can significantly limit any negative environmental impact. Sheep are treated either with injectable insecticides, a pour-on preparation or dipped in a pesticide bath to control parasite infection, which if left untreated can have serious welfare implications for the flock. When managed badly, these pesticides can cause harm to human health and watercourses both on the farm and in subsequent downstream processing. <ref name=autogenerated1 />
==== Silk ====
Most commercially produced silk is of the cultivated variety and involves feeding the worms a carefully controlled diet of mulberry leaves grown under special conditions. Selected mulberry trees are grown to act as homes for the silkworms. The fibers are extracted by steaming to kill the silk moth chrysalis and then washed in hot water to degum the silk. The silk fiber is known for its strength and is considered a prestigious fiber. Its use in textiles is limited due to its high cost.<ref>{{Cite web|last=truents|date=2010-10-27|title=Natural Protein Fibres|url=https://www.textileschool.com/419/natural-protein-fibers/|access-date=2020-10-31|website=Textile School|language=en-US}}</ref> Most silkworms used to produce silk are not harmed in the process and are grown in their natural habitat, essentially "free range". The silk industry also employs millions of people in rural China.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-10-03|title=Material Guide: Is Silk Sustainable?|url=https://goodonyou.eco/is-silk-sustainable/|access-date=2020-10-31|website=Good On You|language=en}}</ref>

==== Cashmere ====
Cashmere is obtained from the fine, soft hairs of a cashmere goat's underbelly coat. This specific breed of goat is found throughout Asia. Due to the rarity of the breed, four goats are needed to produce enough cashmere for one sweater. Initially cashmere was fairly expensive, but due to increased demand the industry is beginning to take a toll on animals and the land. More and more goats are needed which results in more mouths to feed. Overpopulation of the goats degrades the land due to increased grazing. The cashmere industry is becoming more and more controversial with the questioning of working conditions of goat herders and the underpaying of farmers.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-04-11|title=Material Guide: How Ethical Is Cashmere?|url=https://goodonyou.eco/material-guide-how-ethical-is-cashmere/|access-date=2020-10-31|website=Good On You|language=en}}</ref> 

===Other natural materials===

==== MuSkin ====
Italian company Zero Grado Espace has developed MuSkin, an alternative to [[leather]] made from the cap of the [[phellinus ellipsoideus]] mushroom, a parasitic fungus that grows in subtropical forests. It is water repellent and contains natural [[penicillin]] substances which limit [[bacteria]] proliferation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gzespace.com/research-muskin.html|title=Grado Zero Espace – Mushroom layer Muskin|website=www.gzespace.com|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>

==== Wild rubber ====
Wild Rubber, developed by Flavia Amadeu and Professor Floriano Pastore at the University of Brazil, is an initiative that promotes wild rubber material which comes from the [[sap]] or [[latex]] of the [[Hevea brasiliensis|pará rubber tree]] that grows within a biodiverse ecosystem in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon Rainforest]], Acre, Brazil. It is tapped by local communities who typically have a close relationship the forest and will gather medicinal plants or wild food during their tapping rounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildrubber.com/why-go-wild|title=Why go Wild|website=Wild Rubber|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>

==== Qmilk ====
Qmilch GmbH, a German company has innovated a process to produce a [[textile]] fiber from [[casein]] in milk but it cannot be used for consumption. Qmilk fiber is made from 100% [[Renewable resource|renewable]] resources. In addition, for the production of 1 kg of fiber Qmilch GmbH needs only 5 minutes and max. 2 liters of water.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=https://www.qmilkfiber.eu/?lang=en|title=QMILK – The material of the future|website=www.qmilkfiber.eu|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> This implies a particular level of cost efficiency and ensures a minimum of [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]] emissions. Qmilk fiber is [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] and leaves no traces. In addition, it is naturally antibacterial, especially against the bacterial strains, [[Staphylococcus aureus]] and [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]] and is ideal for people that suffer from textile allergies.

Fabrics made from Qmilk fiber provide high wearing comfort and a silky feel. The organic fiber is tested for harmful substances and dermatologically tested for the wearer's skin and body compatibility 0% chemical additives.<ref name=":11" />

===Manufactured fibers===
Manufactured fibers sit within three categories:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fashion fibers : designing for sustainability|last=Annie|first=Gullingsrud|date=2017-02-09|isbn=9781501306648|location=New York, NY, USA|oclc=915250289}}</ref> Manufactured cellulosic fibers, manufactured synthetic fibers and manufactured protein fiber (azlon). Manufactured cellulosic fibers include modal, [[Lyocell]] (also known under the brand name Tencel), rayon/viscose made from bamboo, rayon/viscose made from wood and [[polylactic acid]] (PLA). Manufactured synthetic fibers include [[polyester]], [[nylon]], [[spandex]], [[acrylic fiber]], [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]] (PP). [[Azlon]] is a manufactured protein fiber.

==== PET plastic ====
{{Main|PET plastic}}

PET plastics are also known as [[Polyethylene terephthalate]](PETE). PET's [[Recycling codes|recycling code]], the number within the three chasing arrows, is one. These plastics are usually beverage bottles (i.e. water, soda, and fruit juice bottles). According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], plastic accounts for 12% of the total amount of waste we produce.<ref name="EPA" /> Recycling plastic reduces air, water, and ground pollution. Recycling is only the first step; investing and purchasing products manufactured from recycled materials is the next of many steps to living sustainably.<gallery>

</gallery>Clothing can be made from plastics. Seventy percent of plastic-derived fabrics come from polyester, and the type of polyester most used in fabrics is [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oecotextiles.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/why-is-recycled-polyester-considered-a-sustainable-textile/|title=Why is Recycled Polyester Considered a Sustainable Textile?|date=14 July 2009|publisher=O Ecotextiles|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>  PET plastic clothing come from reused plastics, often recycled plastic bottles.<ref name="env">{{cite web|url=http://www.natural-environment.com/blog/2008/01/27/what-is-recycled-polyester/|title=What is Recycled Polyester?|publisher=Natural Environment|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> The [[Coca-Cola]] Company, for example, created a "Drink2Wear" line of T-shirts made from recycled bottles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/creating-value-through-sustainable-fashion|title=Creating Value Through Sustainable Fashion|year=2010|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> Generally, PET plastic clothing are made from recycled bottles as follows: plastic bottles are collected, compressed, baled, and shipped into processing facilities where they will be chopped into flakes, and melted into small white pellets. Then, the pellets are processed again, and spun into yarn-like fiber where it can be made into clothing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yesboleh.blogspot.com/2008/05/clothing-made-of-recycled-plastic.html|title=Clothing Made of Recycled Plastic|date=8 May 2008|publisher=yesboleh.blogspot.com|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref> One main benefit of making clothes from recycled bottles is that it keep the bottles and other plastics from occupying landfill space. Another benefit is that it takes 30% less energy to make clothes from recycled plastics than from virgin polyesters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.currentprotocols.com/2010/06/23/recycling-plastic-into-fabric-re-wear-your-bottles/|title=Recycling Plastic into Fabric: Re-Wear Your Bottles|date=23 June 2010|publisher=currentprotocols.com|access-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>{{See also|Synthetic fiber|Plastic clothing}}

== Production ==
Whereas many producers have since the turn of the century been striving for a cradle-to-cradle model of production, or a [[circular economy]], there has so far been no successful example of fully sustainable production, as there is environmental impact from all extractive production practices (in processes of material production, dying, assembly, accessorizing, shipping, retail, washing, recycling etc.) There are  many small initiatives towards change, yet so far all these incremental improvements have been drowned by the explosive popularity of "fast" fashion and its economy of extraction, consumption, waste.

===Producers===
The global political economy and legal system supports a fashion system that enables fashion that has devastating environmental, social, cultural and economic impacts to be priced at a lower price than fashion which involves efforts to minimize harm in the growth, manufacturing, and shipping of the products. This results in higher prices for fashion made from reduced impact materials than clothing produced in a socially and environmentally damaging way (sometimes referred to as conventional methods).<ref name="e2f">{{cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=Sally|last2=Sullivan|first2=Robert|date=May 2007|title=Earth to fashion|journal=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|volume=197|issue=5|pages=128–132}}</ref>

Innovative fashion is being developed and made available to consumers at different levels of the fashion spectrum, from casual clothing to [[haute couture]] which has a reduced social and environmental impact at the materials and manufacture stages of production<ref name=":2" /> and celebrities, models, and designers have recently drawn attention to socially conscious and environmentally friendly fashion.[[File:AirDye®_Design_Capabilities.jpg|thumb|Examples of textiles that have used the AirDye process.]]

=== 3D seamless knitting ===
[[Complete garment knitting|3D seamless knitting]] is a technology that allows an entire garment to be knit with no seams. This production method is considered a sustainable practice due to its reduction in waste and labor. By only using the necessary materials, the producers will be more efficient in their manufacturing process. This production method is similar to seamless knitting, although traditional seamless knitting requires stitching to complete the garment while 3D seamless knitting creates the entire garment, eliminating additional work. The garments are designed using 3D software unlike traditional flat patterns. Shima Seiki and Stoll are currently the two primary manufacturers of the technology. The technology is produced through the use of solar energy and they are selling to brands like Max Mara.<ref>{{Cite book|title=SUSTAINABILITY IN THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY|last=Mutha|first=Subramaniam|publisher=Singer|year=2017}}</ref>

=== Zero-waste ===
[[Zero waste|Zero-waste]] design is a concept that, although has been prevalent for many years, is increasingly being integrated into production. Zero-waste design is used through multiple industries but is very applicable in developing patterns for garments.<ref name=":6" /> The concept of [[Zero-waste fashion|zero-waste pattern making]] is designing the pattern for a garment so that when the textile is cut, there is no extra fabric going to waste. This means the pattern pieces for a garment fit together like puzzle pieces in order to use the entire amount of fabric provided, creating no waste in this step of production.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/fashion/15waste.html|title=Fashion Tries on Zero Waste Design|last=Rosenbloom|first=Stephanie|date=2010-08-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

=== Dyeing ===
Traditional methods of dyeing textiles are incredibly harmful towards the earth's water supply, creating toxic chemicals that effect entire communities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elmaaty|first=Tarek|date=March 26, 2017|title=Supercritical Carbon Dioxide as a Green Media in Textile Dyeing: A Review|journal=Textile Research Journal}}</ref> An alternative to traditional water dyeing is scCO2 dyeing (super critical carbon dioxide). This process creates no waste by using 100% of the dyes, reducing energy by 60% with no auxiliary chemicals, and leaving a quarter of the physical footprint of traditional dyeing. Different names for this process are Drydye and Colordry.<ref>Fortunake, J., & Blackburn, R. (2017). ''Sustainiblity Challenges of Textiles, Dyeing and Finishing Industries: Opportunities for Innovation.'' Lecture presented at ACS Webinars.</ref> Another company called Colorep has patented Airdye, a similar process that they claim uses 95% less water and up to 86% less energy than traditional dyeing methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://textilecore.com/air-dyeing/|title=air dyeing|website=textilecore.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}</ref>

=== Comparison websites and ecolabels===
So far, no brand can label itself as fully sustainable, and controversies are abundant on exactly how to use the concept in relation to fashion, if it can be used at all, or if labels such "slow" and "sustainable" fashion are inherently an oxymoron.<ref name=":5" /> Brands that sell themselves as sustainable often still lack systems to deal with oversupply, take back used clothes, fully recycle fibers, offer repair services, or even support the life of the garment during use (such as instructions on washing, care and repair). Almost no brands offer spare parts, which says a lot about the general life expectancy of garments in general: brand are not supporting consumers to make garments last.

That said, some [[Comparison shopping website|comparison websites]] (such as Rank A Brand, Good On You, ...) exist which compare fashion brands on their sustainability record, and these can at least give an indication to consumers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?269811/Top-brands-failing-on-cotton-sustainability|title=Top brands failing on cotton sustainability {{!}} WWF|website=wwf.panda.org|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rankabrand.org/|title=Compare sustainability of brands {{!}} buy sustainable {{!}} Rank a Brand|website=www.rankabrand.org|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://goodonyou.eco/|title=Good On You|website=Good On You|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>

=== Designers ===
[[File:The Golden Book Gown by Ryan Jude Novelline.jpg|thumb|alt=A mannequin wears a multicolored gown with a golden bodice, full skirt, and flowing train.|[[Ryan Jude Novelline#The Golden Book Gown|''The Golden Book Gown'']] made of recycled and discarded paper book pages.]]
There is no certain stable model among the designers for how to be sustainable in practice, and the understanding of sustainability is always a process or a work-in-progress, and varies by who defines what is "sustainable;" farmers or animals, producers or consumers, managers or workers, local businesses or neighborhoods.<ref name=":1" /> Thus critical scholars would label much of the business-driven discourse on sustainability as "greenwashing" as under the current economic paradigm, "sustainability" is primarily defined as keeping the wheels of perpetual production and consumption turning; to keep the "perpetuum mobile" of fashion running and in [[perpetual motion]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bauman|first=Zygmunt|date=2010-10-01|title=Perpetuum mobile|journal=Critical Studies in Fashion and Beauty|volume=1|pages=55–63|doi=10.1386/csfb.1.1.55_1}}</ref>

There are some designers that experiment in making fashion more sustainable, with various degrees of impact;

==Controversies==
A question at the foundation of sustainable fashion concerns exactly what is to be "sustained" of the current model of fashion. Controversies thus emerge what stakeholder agendas should be prioritized over others. There is also the associated concern of how to curb the practice of [[greenwashing]] on one hand, ad also ensure that firms that promote such practices are subject to increased scrutiny and criticism on the other.

=== Greenwashing ===
A major controversy on sustainable fashion concerns how the "green" imperative is used as a cover-up for systemic labor exploitation, social exclusion and environmental degradation, what is generally labelled as greenwashing. Market-driven sustainability can only address sustainability to a certain degree as brands still need to sell more products in order to be profitable. Thus almost any initiative towards addressing ecological and social issues still contributes to the damage. In a 2017 report, the industry projects that the overall apparel consumption will rise by 63%, from 62 million tons today to 102 million tons in 2030, thus effectively erasing any environmental gains made by current initiatives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalfashionagenda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Pulse-of-the-Fashion-Industry_2017.pdf|title=Pulse Fashion Report 2017|date=2017|website=Global Fashion Agenda, Pulse Report}}</ref> As long as the business models of fashion brands are based on growth as well as production and sales of high quantities of garment, almost all initiatives from the industry remains labelled as greenwashing.

=== Materials controversies ===
Though [[organic cotton]] is considered a more sustainable choice for fabric, as it uses fewer [[pesticides]] and [[chemical fertilizer]]s, it remains less than 1% global cotton production. Hurdles to growth include cost of hand labor for hand weeding, reduced yields in comparison to conventional cotton and absence of fiber commitments from brands to farmers before planting seed. The up front financial risks and costs are therefore shouldered by the farmers, many of whom struggle to compete with economies of scale of corporate farms.

Though some designers have marketed [[bamboo fiber]], as an alternative to conventional cotton, citing that it absorbs greenhouse gases during its life cycle and grows quickly and plentifully without pesticides, the conversion of bamboo fiber to fabric is the same as rayon and is highly toxic. The FTC ruled that labeling of bamboo fiber should read "rayon from bamboo". Bamboo fabric can cause environmental harm in production due to the chemicals used to create a soft viscose from hard bamboo.<ref>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Ray A. |date=24 May 2008 |title=Shades of green: decoding eco fashion's claims |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121158336716218711 |access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> Impacts regarding production of new materials make recycled, reclaimed, surplus, and vintage fabric arguably the most sustainable choice, as the raw material requires no agriculture and no manufacturing to produce.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2015/feb/26/waste-recycling-textiles-fashion-industry|title=Waste is so last season: recycling clothes in the fashion industry|last=Gould|first=Hannah|date=2015-02-26|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> However, it must be noted that these are indicative of a system of production and consumption that creates excessive volumes of waste.

=== Second-hand controversies ===
Used clothing is sold in more than 100 countries. In Tanzania, used clothing is sold at the ''mitumba''  (Swahili for "secondhand") markets. Most of the clothing is imported from the United States.<ref name=":2" /> However, there are concerns that trade in secondhand clothing in African countries decreases development of local industries even as it creates employment in these countries.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Well dressed? : the present and future sustainability of clothing and textiles in the United Kingdom|last=M.|first=Allwood, Julian|date=2006|publisher=Univ. of Cambridge Inst. for Manufacturing|isbn=978-1902546520|oclc=441247814}}</ref> While the reuse of materials brings resource savings, there are some concerns that the influx of cheap, second-hand clothing, particularly in Africa, has undermined indigenous textile industries. With the result that clothing collected in the West under the guise of 'charitable donations' could actually create more poverty. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> And the authors of ''Recycling of Low Grade Clothing Waste'' warn that in the long run, as prices and quality of new clothing continue to decline, the demand for used clothing will also diminish.<ref>http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WR0201_6352_FRP.pdf</ref>

=== Marketing controversies ===
The increase in western consumers’ environmental interest is motivating companies to use sustainable and environmental arguments solely to increase sales. Because environmental and sustainability issues are complex, it is also easy to mislead consumers. Companies can use sustainability as a “marketing ploy” something that can be seen as [[greenwashing]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Niinimäki|first=Kirsi|date=2015-04-20|title=Ethical foundations in sustainable fashion|journal=Textiles and Clothing Sustainability|volume=1|pages=3|doi=10.1186/s40689-015-0002-1|issn=2197-9936|doi-access=free}}</ref> Greenwashing is the deceptive use of an eco-agenda in marketing strategies.<ref name=":1" /> It refers mostly to corporations that make efforts to clean up their reputation because of social pressure or for the purpose of financial gain.

== Future of fashion sustainability ==
In the European Union, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulations required in 2007 that clothing manufacturers and importers identified and quantified the chemicals used in their products.<ref name=":2" />

On May 3, 2012, the world's largest summit on fashion sustainability was held in Copenhagen, gathering more than 1,000 key stakeholders in the industry to discuss the importance of making the fashion industry sustainable. Copenhagen Fashion Summit has since then gathered thousands of people from the fashion industry in their effort to create a movement within the industry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.copenhagenfashionsummit.com/5steps |title=Copenhagen Fashion Summit |publisher=Copenhagen Fashion Summit |date=2012-05-03 |access-date=2012-05-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524033610/http://www.copenhagenfashionsummit.com/5steps |archive-date=2012-05-24 }}</ref>

The Global Change Award, is an innovation challenge created by the H&M foundation.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url=https://www.accenture.com/t20170410T044051Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Consulting/Accenture-HM-Global-Change-Award-Report.pdf|title=Trend report: Future of Sustainable Fashion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321132817/https://www.accenture.com/t20170410T044051Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Consulting/Accenture-HM-Global-Change-Award-Report.pdf|archive-date=2018-03-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> It created a trend report in 2017 to look at the future of sustainable fashion.  Five "megatrends" are identified by the organisation that will lead the future of sustainable fashion.  The first "megatrend" is "Power of Nature" which is the industry looking into materials that have always been looked at as waste as a more sustainable method to making new clothing.<ref name=":02" /> The materials that will mitigate negative impacts from the industry include vegan materials from the earth and recycling old fabric into new clothing.  The second "megatrend" is "Rent a Closet"; this initiative has been around for a while. This trend ultimately lowers the new purchase of clothing and disposal of clothing, which means less waste.<ref name=":02" />  [[Rent the Runway]] is an example of the "Rent a Closet" trend.  Rent the Runway started as a company that would give luxury brands like [[Hervé Leger]], [[Vera Wang]], [[Etro]] to people who may not be able to afford the clothing at regular retail price.  Renting and sharing clothing is also known as CFC (collaborative fashion consumption) a sustainable fashion trend consumers are getting involved in.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samira Iran|date=2017|title=Collaborative fashion consumption and its environmental effects|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal}}</ref>  The third trend is "Long Live Fashion" is the revival of [[Vintage clothing]].<ref name=":02" /> Vintage clothing is a way to lower the amount of clothing that gets disposed of and ends up in landfills.  Companies like RE/DONE, Vintage Twin and Frankie Collective sell re-paired vintage clothing. Repairing and reselling clothing has less negative impact than creating new clothing does.   The fourth megatrend is  "innovative recycling" which is looking at waste as value.  The industry is starting to create incentives for consumers to participate in the recycling of clothing.<ref name=":02" /> The fifth megatrend is "Connected Clothes" which allows for more opportunities in digitalizing clothing for personalization, life-tracking, and traceability of its origin.<ref name=":02" />

Tailored couture is one option for the future of a greener fashion industry as it can potentially lead to less waste and more jobs improving the economy. Tailored couture is no longer desired because of the convenience of malls and stores provide but the consequence of the convenience is the pollution of the environment. Tailored clothing if it were to become the norm mass production of clothing that will not be bought can be reduced and reusing and redesigning old clothes to fit could reduce the amount of old worn out unfitting clothes thrown out or given away.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maynard |first1=Margaret |title=Dress and Globalization |date=2004 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0719063893}}</ref>

In 2019, the UK Parliament's Environment Audit Committee published a report and recommendations on the future of fashion sustainability, suggesting wide-ranging systemic change, not least government regulation and tax-incentives for sustainable practices, such as lowered VAT for repair services.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmenvaud/1952/report-summary.html|title=Fixing fashion: clothing consumption and sustainability – Report Summary – Environmental Audit Committee|website=publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> As highlighted in the report, wide political and social changes are needed to push industry towards more sustainable practices and levels of consumption: brands doing "less harm" is not enough. The report finishes with the following statement;<blockquote>"Retailers must take responsibility for the social and environmental cost of clothes. They should use their market power to demand higher environmental and labour standards from suppliers. Offering rental schemes, lifetime repair and providing the consumer with more information about the sourcing and true cost of clothing are all measures that can be more widely adopted. Shifting business practice in this way can not only improve a business’s environmental and social impact but also offer market advantage as they respond to the growing consumer demand for responsible, sustainable clothing."(p.54)<ref name=":7" /></blockquote>
