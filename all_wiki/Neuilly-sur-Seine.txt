'''Neuilly-sur-Seine''' ({{IPA-fr|nøji syʁ sɛn|-|LL-Q150 (fra)-Bastenbas (Bastenbas (Lingua))-Neuilly-sur-Seine.wav}}), known as '''Neuilly''', is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Hauts-de-Seine]] in [[France]], just west of [[Paris]].

==History==
Originally Pont de Neuilly was a small hamlet under the jurisdiction of Villiers, a larger settlement mentioned in medieval sources as early as 832 and now absorbed by the commune of [[Levallois-Perret]]. It was not until 1222 that the little settlement of Neuilly, established on the banks of the [[Seine]], was mentioned for the first time in a [[charter]] of the [[Saint-Denis Basilica|Abbey of Saint-Denis]]: the name was recorded in [[Medieval Latin]] as ''Portus de Lulliaco'', meaning "Port of Lulliacum." In 1224 another charter of Saint-Denis recorded the name as ''Lugniacum.'' In a sales contract dated 1266, the name was also recorded as ''Luingni.''

In 1316, however, in a ruling of the ''[[parlement]]'' of Paris, the name was recorded as ''Nully'', a different name from those recorded before. In a document dated 1376 the name was again recorded as ''Nulliacum'' (the Medieval Latin version of ''Nully''). Then in the following centuries the name recorded alternated between ''Luny'' and ''Nully'', and it is only after 1648 that the name was definitely set as ''Nully''. The name spelt ''Neuilly'' after the [[Académie française|French Academy]] standard of pronunciation of the ''ill'' as a ''y'' (see IPA at the top).

Various explanations and etymologies have been proposed to explain these discrepancies in the names of Neuilly recorded over the centuries. The original name of Neuilly may have been ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'', and that it was only later corrupted into ''Nulliacum'' / ''Nully''. Some interpret ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'' as meaning "estate of Lullius (or Lunius)", probably a [[Gallo-Roman]] landowner. This interpretation is based on the many placenames of France made up of the names of Gallo-Roman landowners and suffixed with the traditional placename suffix "-acum." Other researchers, however, object that it is unlikely that Neuilly owes its name to a Gallo-Roman [[patronym]], because during the Roman occupation of [[Gaul]] the area of Neuilly was inside the large [[Forest of Rouvray]], of which the [[Bois de Boulogne]] is all that remains today, and was probably not a settlement.

These researchers contend that it is only after the fall of the Roman Empire and the Germanic invasions that the area of Neuilly was deforested and settled. Thus, they think that the name ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'' comes from the ancient Germanic word ''lund'' meaning "forest", akin to [[Old Norse]] ''lundr'' meaning "grove", to which the placename suffix "-acum" was added. The Old Norse word ''lundr'' has indeed left many placenames across Europe, such as the city of [[Lund]] in Sweden, the Forest of the Londe in [[Normandy]], or the many English placenames containing "lound", "lownde", or "lund" in their name, or ending in "-land." This interesting theory, however, fails to explain why the "d" of ''lund'' is missing in ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum''.

Concerning the discrepancy in names over the centuries, the most probable explanation is that the original name ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'' was later corrupted into ''Nulliacum'' / ''Nully'' by inversion of the consonants, perhaps under the influence of an old Celtic word meaning "swampy land, boggy land" (as was the land around Neuilly-sur-Seine in ancient times) which is found in the name of many French places anciently covered with water, such as Noue, Noë, Nouan, Nohant, etc. Or perhaps the consonants were simply inverted under the influence of the many settlements of France called Neuilly (a frequent place name whose etymology is completely different from the special case of Neuilly-sur-Seine).

Until the [[French Revolution]], the settlement was often referred to as ''Port-Neuilly'', but at the creation of [[commune in France|French communes]] in 1790 the "Port" was dropped and the newly born commune was named simply '''Neuilly'''.

On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, a part of the territory of Neuilly-sur-Seine was annexed by the city of Paris, and forms now the neighbourhood of [[Ternes]], in the [[XVIIe arrondissement|17th arrondissement]] of Paris.

On 11 January 1867, part of the territory of Neuilly-sur-Seine was detached and merged with a part of the territory of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]] to create the commune of [[Levallois-Perret]].

On 4 June 1878, a [[:fr:Synagogue de Neuilly|Synagogue]]  was founded on Rue Ancelle, which is the oldest synagogue of Paris' suburbs.

On 2 May 1897, the commune name officially became Neuilly-sur-Seine (meaning "Neuilly upon [[Seine]]"), in order to distinguish it from the [[Neuilly|many communes of France also called Neuilly]]. Most people, however, continue to refer to Neuilly-sur-Seine as simply "Neuilly." During the [[1900 Summer Olympics]], it hosted the [[Basque pelota at the 1900 Summer Olympics|basque pelota]] events.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200418124414/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1900/PEL/mens-two-man-teams-with-cesta.html Sports-reference.com Summer Olympics Paris 14 June 1900 men's basque pelota two-teams results.], Sports-reference.com, Accessed 14 November 2010.</ref>

The [[American Hospital of Paris]] was founded in 1906.

In 1919, the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] was signed with [[Bulgaria]] in Neuilly-sur-Seine to conclude its role in World War I.

In 1929, the [[Bois de Boulogne]], which was hitherto divided between the communes of Neuilly-sur-Seine and [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], was annexed in its entirety by the city of Paris.
