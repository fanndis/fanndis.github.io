'''ActionAid''' is an [[international non-governmental organization]] whose stated primary aim is to work against poverty and injustice worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actionaid.org/who-we-are|title=Who we are|publisher=ActionAid|access-date=2011-05-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820005813/http://www.actionaid.org/who-we-are|archive-date=2018-08-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>

ActionAid is a federation of 45 country offices that works with communities, often via local partner organisations, on a range of development issues. It was founded in 1972 by [[Cecil Jackson-Cole]] as a [[child sponsorship]] charity (originally called Action in Distress) when 88 UK supporters sponsored 88 children in India and [[Kenya]], the primary focus being is providing children with an education, further the human rights for all, assisting people that are in poverty, assisting those who face discrimination,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.actionaid.org/what-we-do|title=What we do {{!}} ActionAid|website=www.actionaid.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113034100/http://www.actionaid.org/what-we-do|archive-date=2017-11-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> and also assist people who face injustice.<ref name="Who we are {{!}} ActionAid">{{Cite web|url=http://www.actionaid.org/who-we-are|title=Who we are {{!}} ActionAid|website=www.actionaid.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820005813/http://www.actionaid.org/who-we-are|archive-date=2018-08-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> ActionAid works with over 15 million people in 45 different countries to assist those people.<ref name="Who we are {{!}} ActionAid"/>

Today its head office is located in South Africa with hubs in Asia, the Americas and Europe. ActionAid was the first big INGO to move its headquarters from the [[global north]] to the [[global south]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/why-actionaid-had-move-its-headquarters-britain-south-africa|title=Facilitating more than leading|website=Development and Cooperation|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.devex.com/news/internationalizing-your-ngo-4-lessons-from-actionaid-84477|title='Internationalizing' your NGO: 4 lessons from ActionAid|website=Devex|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref> ActionAid's current strategy aims to "build international momentum for social, economic and [[environmental justice]], driven by people living in poverty and exclusion".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.actionaid.org/publications/action-global-justice|title=Strategy 2028: Action for Global Justice|website=www.actionaid.org|access-date=2017-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820074519/http://www.actionaid.org/publications/action-global-justice|archive-date=2018-08-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Tax & economic justice ==

ActionAid has been campaigning for tax justice since 2008, conducting research into the effects of various international tax treaties and supporting local people and organisations to hold their governments to account.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/07/the-anatomy-of-a-campaign-tax-justice-actionaid|title=The anatomy of a campaign: tax justice, ActionAid|website=The Guardian}}</ref> It argues that losing tax revenue to avoidance harms the world's poorest and most marginalised people, who depend on tax-funded [[public services]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/global-taxes/52401-how-tax-havens-plunder-the-poor.html|title=How Tax Havens Plunder the Poor|website=Global Policy Forum}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://business-humanrights.org/en/actionaid-report-says-shady-tax-treaties-disproportionately-favour-multinationals-increasing-inequality-poverty-in-poor-countries|title=ActionAid report says "shady" tax treaties disproportionately favour multinationals, increasing inequality & poverty in poor countries|website=Business and Human Rights Resource Centre}}</ref> It is also often the case that the tax revenue lost in these treaties can exceed the amount of [[international aid]] money send to developing countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.svd.se/bistand-verkar-inte-i-ett-vakuum|language=sw|title=Bistånd verkar inte i ett vakuum|website=Svenska Dagbladet}}</ref>

In 2011, ActionAid revealed that 98% of the UK's [[FTSE 100]] companies use [[tax havens]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/10/companies-actionaid-tax|title=98 of FTSE 100 companies use tax havens|website=New Statesman}}</ref> In 2013 its research into corporate [[tax avoidance]] in [[Zambia]] showed that [[Associated British Foods]] were avoiding paying millions of dollars in corporate tax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2013/feb/09/associated-british-foods-avoids-corporate-tax-zambia-video|title=ugar manufacturer Associated British Foods avoids paying corporate tax in Zambia – video|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

== Women's rights ==

ActionAid integrates [[women's rights]] into all of its programming and project work, but also undertakes campaigns that focus specifically on these issues.

Notable examples have included raising awareness about unpaid care work<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/22/women-do-four-years-more-work-than-men-in-lifetime-report-shows|title=Women do four years more work than men in lifetime, report shows|website=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/dawn-foster/women%27s-paid-and-unpaid-work-and-colonial-hangover|title=Women's paid and unpaid work, and the colonial hangover}}</ref> and sexual harassment<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/50-percent-bangladesh-women-face-unwanted-touching-at-markets-shopping-says-actionaid-study-1434028|title=50% women face unwanted touching at markets: Study|website=The Daily Star}}</ref> and violence<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/real-life/actionaid-safe-harm/|title=Gemma Chan Shares Powerful Stories From Sexual Violence Victims In New ActionAid Film|website=Grazia}}</ref> (including [[acid attacks]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/brave-acid-attack-victims-take-9997726|title=Brave acid attack victims take to catwalk as they "refuse to hide their faces"|website=The Mirror}}</ref>) in [[Bangladesh]], offering free [[cancer]] tests to women in [[Nigeria]] who could not afford them,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2017/05/18/actionaid-nigeria-offers-free-cancer-tests-to-100-women/|title=Actionaid Nigeria Offers Free Cancer Tests to 100 Women}}</ref> and tackling [[female genital mutilation]] in Sweden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.svd.se/tusentals-flickor-i-sverige-riskerar-konsstympning|language=sw|title="Tusentals flickor i Sverige riskerar könsstympning"}}</ref>

== Climate justice ==

ActionAid's advocacy work on [[climate change]] focuses on [[climate justice]], guided by the experiences and needs of its country programmes. Its most prominent engagement comes through the annual [[Conference of Parties]], where it supports communities vulnerable to climate change to influence decision-making processes.

It calls for rich countries to live up to pledges of providing [[climate adaptation]] grants<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/how-conflict-increases-countries-climate-change-risk/|title=How conflict increases countries’ climate change risk|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-accord-trump/trump-win-will-not-derail-global-climate-effort-activists-vow-idUSKBN1342MD|title=Trump win will not derail global climate effort, activists vow|website=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blueandgreentomorrow.com/news/wwf-care-action-aid-launch-adaptation-report/|title=WWF, Care And Action Aid Launch Adaptation Report|website=Blue & Green Tomorrow}}</ref> and pushes for agreements to improve the lives of those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/14/paris-climate-change-deal-cop21-oxfam-actionaid|title=Paris climate change deal too weak to help poor, critics warn|website=The Guardian}}</ref> ActionAid was also critical of [[climate risk insurance|climate insurance]] policies, such as those purchased by Malawi in 2015, since those insurance policies fail to deliver when they are desperately needed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.times.mw/action-aid-faults-drought-insurance-that-failed-malawi/|title=Action Aid faults drought insurance that failed Malawi}}</ref>

== Emergencies & humanitarian aid ==

ActionAid promotes women's leadership in humanitarian responses, arguing that women are best positioned to identify their needs and those of the communities around them in times of crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://leftfootforward.org/2016/05/world-humanitarian-summit-time-to-shift-power-to-women-on-the-frontlines/|title=World Humanitarian Summit: Time to shift power to women on the frontlines|website=Left Foot Forward}}</ref> Strengthening citizens' rights is also a focus, such as campaigning with Haitians for greater transparency and accountability in how aid money was spent after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/two-years-actionaid%E2%80%99s-earthquake-response-continues-huge-challenges-remain|title=Two years on, ActionAid's earthquake response continues, but huge challenges remain|website=ReliefWeb}}</ref>

As it has established relationships with communities and other NGOs in countries that are prone to ecological events, ActionAid is often able to respond quickly to emergencies. Notable crises and responses have included the [[Boxing Day tsunami]] in 2010 in the [[Indian ocean]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/finance-actionaid-close-budget-its-six-month-tsunami-relief-spend/article/620866|title=Finance: ActionAid close to budget on its six-month tsunami relief spend|website=Third Sector}}</ref> drought in East Africa<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tech4goodawards.com/finalist/mobile-phones-save-lives-in-remote-african-communities-affected-by-drought/|title=Mobile phones save lives in remote African communities affected by drought}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/yourlanguage/african/en/audiotrack/actionaid-appeals-help-drought-hit-areas-east-africa|title=ActionAid appeals for help in drought-hit areas of East Africa}}</ref> and India,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/drought-causing-unprecedented-suffering-actionaid/article18315209.ece|title=Unprecedented crop loss in State, says ActionAid|website=The Hindu}}</ref> and floods in [[Ghana]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/ActionAid-donates-to-Dome-flood-victims-363946|title=ActionAid donates to Dome flood victims|website=GhanaWeb}}</ref> [[Rwanda]],<ref>{{Cite web|website=The New Times, Rwanda|title=Action Aid donates to flood victims|url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/20200}}</ref> [[Sierra Leone]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201510053105.html|title=Sierra Leone: Action Aid Donates Food Items to Flood Victims|website=All Africa}}</ref> [[Bangladesh]] and [[Nepal]].

ON 4 OCTOBER 2018 ActionAid announced that Pakistan government has ordered 18 [[international aid]] groups to leave the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pakistan-tells-18-international-ngos-to-leave-country-says-actionaid-1926938|title=Pakistan Tells 18 International NGOs To Leave Country: Report|website=NDTV.com|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>

== Child sponsorship ==

[[Child sponsorship]] is one of ActionAid's primary sources of income. Donors sponsor an individual child<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sofii.org/case-study/actionaids-welcome-to-child-sponsorship-package|title=ActionAid: the welcome to child sponsorship package}}</ref> from a community in a developing country and receive regular updates about the child's progress and development.

Sponsorship funds support the child's whole community, "so children have a healthy and safe place to live and grow up." This support takes the form of providing clean water, healthcare, agricultural programmes, education centres in areas where schools are not available, and community income generation schemes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.actionaid.org.uk/blog/news/2016/07/04/six-things-you-should-know-about-sponsoring-a-child|title=Six things you should know about sponsoring a child|website=ActionAid UK}}</ref>

== Alliance-building ==

As ActionAid has grown in influence, building alliances with like-minded organisations has become a key focus area. Announcing this approach at the [[World Social Forum]] in 2015,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/23/world-social-forum-tunis-activists-united-against-global-power-grab|title=World Social Forum can inspire activists to unite against the global power grab|website=The Guardian}}</ref> ActionAid has played a role in convening civil society and community groups to tackle issues of youth political participation in the Middle East<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/ngo-seizes-election-opportunity-boost-youth%E2%80%99s-political-mobilisation|title=NGO seizes election opportunity to boost youth's political mobilisation|website=The Jordan Times}}</ref> and global [[wiktionary:Inequality|inequality]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fightinequality.org/en/about/|title=About – Fight Inequality|access-date=2017-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119213743/https://www.fightinequality.org/en/about/|archive-date=2017-11-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Supporting social causes through the mass media==
ActionAid made India's first [[Bollywood]] film focusing on AIDS,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} ''[[Ek Alag Mausam]]'', a love story involving [[HIV positive]] people, based on a script by playwright [[Mahesh Dattani]].<ref name=Smashits>{{cite web

ActionAid also supported [[Shyam Benegal]]'s film, ''[[Samar (1999 film)|Samar]]'', which is based on the book ''Unheard Voices: Stories of Forgotten Lives'' by [[Harsh Mander]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2001/05/20/stories/1320017c.htm|title=The Hindu : Working for change|website=www.hindu.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> The film raises issues about [[Dalit]]s.<ref name=Smashits/>

== Criticism ==
[[Charity Navigator]] recorded that in 2012 ActionAid USA had a high cost of fund raising (24%), with 53% of income spent on projects.<ref name="charitynavigator.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=8757#.U8WeVvmSw2E|title=Charity Navigator Rating – ActionAid USA|work=Charity Navigator|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref> This was also reported in an ''[[International Business Times]]'' article in October 2014, which noted that the "accounting processes the charity uses resulted in its administrative costs appearing to be 'particularly high' in the fiscal year ending 2012, the timeframe Charity Navigator relied on when calculating its current Charity Navigator score."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ebola-relief-charities-5-aid-groups-avoid-donating-1703226|title=Ebola Relief Charities: 5 Aid Groups To Avoid Donating To|author=Connor Adams Sheets|date=10 October 2014|work=International Business Times|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref> Charity Navigator reports that for 2013 the cost of fundraising for ActionAid USA was much lower (9.4%), with 82.4% of income spent on projects.<ref name="charitynavigator.org"/>

ActionAid has been criticized for spreading unsupported claims and "grotesque" pictures of adverse effects from consumption of some [[genetically engineered crops]] in Africa, in particular the unsupported claim of genetically engineered crops causing tumors and cancer. The organization apologized for their misleading actions in 2015, after publication in the media.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/actionaid-the-charity-spreading-groundless-fears-over-gm-10126504.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325220221/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/actionaid-the-charity-spreading-groundless-fears-over-gm-10126504.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 March 2015|title=ActionAid: The charity spreading 'groundless' fears over GM|work=The Independent|date=25 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/03/30/actionaid-in-africa-ensnared-by-its-own-ugly-gmo-cancer-scare-tactics/|title=ActionAid in Africa ensnared by its own ugly GMO cancer scare tactics|first=Isaac |last=Ongu|date=30 March 2015|publisher=}}</ref>

ActionAid, who had supported coffee growing in 2000 and had earlier openly agitated against the democratically elected Haitian government of [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/23/owenbowcott|title=Violence and boycott mar Haitian election campaign|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|date=2000-11-23|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref> is, with a number of other [[NGO]]s, strongly criticized for supporting the US-backed [[2004 Haitian coup d'état|coup that removed this, the first democratically elected president of Haiti in 2004]], a coup which is described as "perhaps the most successful act of [[Imperialism|imperial]] sabotage since the end of the [[Cold War]]".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BA85842530|title=Damming the flood : Haiti, Aristide, and the politics of containment|last=Hallward|first=Peter|date=2007|publisher=Verso|language=en}}</ref>
