The daughter of [[bodybuilder]] and actor [[Mickey Hargitay]] and actress [[Jayne Mansfield]], Hargitay made her film debut in the 1985 horror comedy film ''[[Ghoulies]]'' and her major television debut in the 1986 adventure drama series ''Downtown''.

==Early life==
 
Hargitay was born at [[St. John's Health Center|St. John's Hospital]] in [[Santa Monica, California]], the daughter of actress and 1950s-era [[sex symbol]] [[Jayne Mansfield]]. Her father was the Hungarian-born former [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]], [[Mickey Hargitay]]. Her first and middle names are Hungarian and refer to [[Mary Magdalene]] (Mariska is a [[diminutive]] of Mary). She was raised Catholic. She has two older brothers, Miklós and Zoltán, and three half-siblings, [[Jayne Marie Mansfield]] and Antonio "Tony" Cimber (from her mother's first and third marriages, respectively) and Tina Hargitay (from her father's first marriage).{{cn|date=October 2019}}

Hargitay's parents [[divorce]]d in May 1963, but a judge later found their [[Mexican divorce]] invalid. They reconciled a few months before Hargitay's birth in January 1964, but soon separated again. In August 1964, Hargitay's mother successfully petitioned the court to rule the Mexican divorce legal. A few weeks later, Mansfield married the director [[Matt Cimber]], who had directed her in a 1964 production of the [[William Inge]] play ''[[Bus Stop (play)|Bus Stop]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} By the summer of 1966, however, Mansfield and Cimber had filed for divorce. On June 29, 1967, Mansfield was in an automobile accident on a stretch of [[U.S. Route 90]] between [[New Orleans]] and [[Bay St. Louis]], [[Mississippi]]. The accident ripped off the top of the car, instantly killing Mansfield;<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Coyne|first=Kate|date=October 2004|title=Surviving the past|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/14536831|journal=Good Housekeeping|volume=239|issue=4|pages=162–165|url-access=subscription|via=EBSCOhost Connection}}{{dead link|date=November 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> her boyfriend, Sam Brody; and the driver.

===''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit''===
Casting for the lead characters of [[NBC]] [[police procedural]] television drama series ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' occurred in the spring of 1999. [[Dick Wolf]], along with officials from NBC and Studios USA, were at the final auditions for the two leads at [[Rockefeller Center]]. The last round had been narrowed down to six finalists. For the female lead – Detective [[Olivia Benson]] – [[Samantha Mathis]], [[Reiko Aylesworth]], and Hargitay were being considered. For the male lead – Detective [[Elliot Stabler]] – the finalists were [[Tim Matheson]], [[John Slattery]], and [[Christopher Meloni]]. Meloni and Hargitay had auditioned in the final round together, and after the actors left, there was a moment of dead silence, after which Wolf blurted out, "Oh well. There's no doubt who we should choose – Hargitay and Meloni." The duo, who Wolf believed had the perfect chemistry from the first time he saw them together, were his first choice. [[Garth Ancier]], then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled voiced their assent.<ref>{{cite book|last=Green|first=Susan|author2=Dawn, Randee |title=Law & Order: Special Victims Unit Unofficial Companion |publisher=BenBella Books, Inc|year=2009|page=11|isbn=978-1-933771-88-5}}</ref> Hargitay trained as a rape crisis advocate to prepare for the role of Benson.<ref name=Shape>Oglethorpe, Alice.

Hargitay is the founder and former president of the Joyful Heart Foundation, an organization established in 2004 to provide support to survivors of [[sexual assault]], [[domestic violence]], and [[child abuse]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redbookmag.com/fun-contests/celebrity/actress-mariska-hargitay |title=Behind the Scenes with Mariska Hargitay |work=[[Redbook]] |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] |last=Martin |first=Crystal |access-date=January 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929113322/http://www.redbookmag.com/fun-contests/celebrity/actress-mariska-hargitay |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Guide: What's Worth Watching|journal=[[TV Guide]]|date=July 5, 2010|page=8}}</ref> According to Hargitay, she was inspired by an encounter with a school of dolphins that surrounded her while she was swimming off the coast of Hawaii at the age of 15. The encounter, which had ignited profound spiritual feelings within her, was one that Hargitay hoped to share with others. As of November 2010, the Joyful Heart Foundation has sent over 5,000 women and children on therapeutic programs in New York, Los Angeles, and Hawaii, which combine yoga, meditation, massage, journaling, and swimming with dolphins.<ref name=Shape/> Hargitay said,

{{cquote|I started getting fan mail from survivors who felt a connection to Olivia. In many of these letters, people would disclose their personal stories of abuse—some for the very first time. I remember getting the sense that many were living in isolation with so much shame, but the shame belonged to the perpetrators. I wanted to help find a way to help people reclaim their lives and live them with a renewed sense of possibility and hope. And that's what we work to do every day at Joyful Heart.<ref name="joy">{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/SVU-Mariska-Hargitay-1015241.aspx |title=SVU's Mariska Hargitay Helps Trauma Survivors On-Screen and Off |last=Ross |first=Robyn |date=February 19, 2010 |work=[[TV Guide]] |publisher=[[Lionsgate]] |access-date=February 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220230030/http://www.tvguide.com/News/SVU-Mariska-Hargitay-1015241.aspx |archive-date=February 20, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

Since Hargitay received these letters from women, she knew that she had to use her platform to do something really special.<ref name=":0" /> Her character, Olivia Benson, was heavily involved in rape and domestic violence cases in New York; in many episodes she defended the women, because she knew the trauma that they had experienced.<ref name=":0" /> Some women who watched the show felt a connection with her, which led them to send Hargitay letters because they thought she could do something with them. She, in fact ,did; Hargitay became a certified rape counselor.<ref name=":0" /> With this, she was able to talk to these women, make them feel better, and let them know that they are not alone; she helped the victims to be able to live their lives again.<ref name=":0" />

According to Hargitay, the Foundation has raised $20 million and helped approximately 5,000 survivors as of April 2011.<ref>Sonia Harmon, Kate Meyers and Susan Pocharski. "Ladies Who Give Back", ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'' (April 2011), pages 84–85</ref> Reference to the Joyful Heart Foundation was worked into episodes of ''Special Victims Unit'', via a necklace containing two pendants representing the Foundation that Hargitay's character began wearing in the show's [[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)|13th season]].<ref>Keck, William. "Ask Keck". ''TV Guide''. November 7, 2011.

Back in November 2009, Hargitay and the Joyful Heart Foundation built healing and wellness kits for women that suffered domestic violence attacks and were currently in the Los Angeles County's domestic violence shelters.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Weller|first=Sheila|date=May 2012|title=My FAITH Pulled Me Through|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/75125818|journal=Good Housekeeping|volume=254|issue=5|pages=136–195|url-access=subscription|via=EBSCOhost Connection}}{{dead link|date=November 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> They created enough kits to give one to each of about 600 women.<ref name=":1" /> In California, the domestic violence services budget was in a major crisis, and shelters were forced to turn women away because they couldn't afford to keep them. Mariska and her foundation fought for this cause and donated money to show how important it is for these women to have shelters that they can go to in order to feel safe.<ref name=":1" />

Hargitay has worked with Michigan Police and Wayne County Prosecutor [[Kym Worthy]] to raise awareness about the statistics of untested [[rape kits]]. While planning to produce a documentary called ''Shelved'' about the thousands of untested rape kits, Hargitay called this lack of testing "the clearest and most shocking demonstration of how we regard these crimes in our country."<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Corey|date=10 March 2014|title=Mariska Hargitay: How the SVU star is fighting real-life sex crimes|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0310/Mariska-Hargitay-How-the-SVU-star-is-fighting-real-life-sex-crimes|website=[[Christian Science Monitor]]}}</ref>
