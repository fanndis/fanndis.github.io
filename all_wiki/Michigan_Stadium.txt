==History==

===Early history===
Prior to playing at Michigan Stadium, Michigan played its games at [[Ferry Field]], which at its peak could seat 40,000 people. Fielding Yost recognized the need for a larger stadium after original expansions to Ferry Field proved to be too small, and persuaded the regents to build a permanent stadium in 1926. Fashioned after the [[Yale Bowl]], the original stadium was built with a capacity of 72,000. However, at Yost's urging, temporary bleachers were added at the top of the stadium, increasing capacity to 82,000.<ref name="history"/><ref name=expansion>{{cite web| title=The Michigan Stadium Story: Expansion and Renovation, 1928-1997| url=https://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/stadium/stadtext/stadexp.htm| date=10 April 2006| accessdate=2014-02-26| publisher=Bentley Historical Library}}</ref>

[[File:Michigan Stadium opening 3c27311.png|thumb|right|300px|Formal dedication of the new Michigan Stadium, October 22, 1927, against [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]]]]
On October 1, 1927, Michigan played [[Ohio Wesleyan University|Ohio Wesleyan]] in the first game at Michigan Stadium, prevailing easily, 33–0. The new stadium was then formally dedicated three weeks later in a contest against [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] on October 22. Michigan had spoiled the formal dedication of [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] five years earlier and was victorious again, besting the Buckeyes 21–0 before a standing-room-only crowd of 84,401. In 1930, electronic scoreboards were installed, making the stadium the first in the United States to use them to keep the official game time.<ref name="history"/>

In 1956, the addition of a press box raised the stadium's official capacity to 101,001. The one "extra seat" in Michigan Stadium is said to be reserved for [[Fritz Crisler]], athletic director at the time.<ref name="crisler"/> Since then, all official Michigan Stadium capacity figures have ended in "-01", although the extra seat's location is not specified.<ref name="history"/>

Before 1968, Michigan Stadium maintained a policy of "No women or children allowed on the field". Sara Krulwich, now a photojournalist for ''[[The New York Times]]'', was the first woman on the field.<ref name="Essay">{{cite news |title=Essay: "No Women" Was No Barrier |first=Sara |last=Krulwich |url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/22/essay-first-woman-on-the-field/ |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=May 22, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> Longtime radio announcer [[Bob Ufer]] dubbed Michigan Stadium "The hole that Yost dug, Crisler paid for, [[Don Canham|Canham]] carpeted, and [[Bo Schembechler|Schembechler]] fills every cotton-pickin' Saturday afternoon".<ref name="Feldman">{{cite news| title=Through Transition, Class of '09 Had Its Ups, But Mostly Downs| first=Dan| last=Feldman| url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/2009-04-24/through-transition-class-09-had-its-ups-mostly-downs| newspaper=[[The Michigan Daily]]| publisher=michigandaily.com| date=April 20, 2009| accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref> Since November 8, 1975, the stadium has held over 100,000 fans for every home game—the game against [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana University]] on October 25, 1975 was the last sub-100,000 attendance home game for Michigan.<ref name="MUAtt1">{{cite web|url=https://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/stadium/stadtext/mattend.htm|title=The Michigan Stadium Story: Michigan Stadium Attendance Records|date=January 15, 2011|publisher=Bentley Historical Library|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref><ref name="1975 team">{{cite web| title=1975 Football Team| date=March 31, 2007| publisher=Bentley Historical Library| url=https://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1975fbt.htm| accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref>—and 24 of the 25 most attended NCAA games are at the stadium.<ref name="NCAA att" /> Michigan Stadium's size is not wholly apparent from the outside as most of the seats are below ground level.

On September 9, 2006, attendees of Michigan's football game against the [[2006 Central Michigan Chippewas football team|Central Michigan Chippewas]] endured the first weather delay in the stadium's history after lightning struck nearby during the first quarter and play was suspended for approximately one hour.<ref name="LATimes">{{cite news |title=Michigan: The Season| first=Dave| last=Wharton| url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/01/sports/sp-michseason1| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| publisher=LATimes.com| page=S-12| date=January 1, 2007| accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref>  On September 3, 2011, Michigan and [[2011 Western Michigan Broncos football team|Western Michigan]] mutually agreed to end their game with 1:27 left in the third quarter because of an ongoing lightning delay.

On June 21, 2007, the University's Board of Regents approved a $226 million [[renovation]] (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US-GDP|226000000|2007}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) and expansion project for Michigan Stadium. The project included replacement of some bleachers, widening of aisles and individual seats, installing hand rails, and the addition of a new press box, 83 [[luxury box]]es, and 3,200 club seats. The renovation plan garnered opposition from a small number of students, alumni, and fans around the country, which waned as the renovation neared external completion.<ref name="AAnews">{{cite news |title=U-M Professors Urge Reconsideration of Michigan Stadium Expansion|first=Lynn|last=Monson|url=http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2007/09/um_professors_urge_reconsidera.html| newspaper=The Ann Arbor News| publisher=Mlive.com| date=September 14, 2007| accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref>

The lights were first used at the men's hockey game on December 11, 2010.  The following season saw the stadium's first night football game on September 10, 2011.

==Seating and surface==
The stadium's original capacity was 72,000, but Fielding Yost made certain to install footings that could allow for expansion up to 200,000 seats. Initially, all seating consisted of wooden bleachers. These were replaced with permanent metal seating in 1949 by Fritz Crisler, athletic director at the time. From 1927 to 1968, the stadium's field was natural grass. This was replaced with 3M TartanTurf in 1969 to give players better traction. However, this surface was thought to be unforgiving on players' joints, and the stadium returned to natural grass in 1991. This too became problematic, as the field's below-surface location near the water table made it difficult for grass to permanently take root. The field was converted to [[FieldTurf]], an artificial surface designed to give grass-like playing characteristics, in 2003.<ref name="FieldTurf">{{cite news| title=FieldTurf Receives Praise From Carr| first=Michael| last=Nisson |url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/fieldturf-receives-praise-carr| newspaper=The Michigan Daily| publisher=michigandaily.com| date=August 11, 2003| accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref> In 2010, it was upgraded with a newer version of FieldTurf called Duraspine.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/041710aai.html| title=2010 Football Spring Game Notes| date=April 17, 2010| publisher=University of Michigan Athletics| accessdate=2014-02-26}}</ref>
