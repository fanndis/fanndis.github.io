There was a '''Scottish National Party leadership election''' to choose the new leader of the [[Scottish National Party]] at the SNP's conference on 14â€“15 November 2014. The election followed the announcement by SNP Leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]], in the aftermath of the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|Scottish independence referendum]], that he would not seek re-nomination as party leader and would resign as First Minister soon after the SNP elected a new leader. Given the SNP's absolute majority in the [[Scottish Parliament]], the new leader was all but assured of becoming the next First Minister. [[Nicola Sturgeon]], the SNP's depute leader and the [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]], was elected unopposed as his successor.

It had been obvious even before then that no one else would garner enough nominations to make a viable bid for the post.

She was formally acclaimed as the party's first female leader at the SNP Autumn Conference on 14 November 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-30011423 |title=SNP conference: Nicola Sturgeon appointed party leader - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-11-14 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref> This all but assured her formal election as First Minister on 19 November 2014.
