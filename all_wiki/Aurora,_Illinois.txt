Once a mid-sized manufacturing city, Aurora has grown since the 1960s. Founded within Kane County, Aurora's city limits and population have expanded into DuPage, Will, and Kendall counties. Between 2000 and 2003, the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] ranked Aurora as the 34th fastest-growing city in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=The fastest growing US cities: Cities ranked 1 to 100|url=http://www.citymayors.com/gratis/uscities_growth.html|publisher=The City Mayors Foundation|accessdate=25 September 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926210555/http://www.citymayors.com/gratis/uscities_growth.html|archivedate=26 September 2011}}</ref> From 2000 to 2009, the U.S. Census Bureau ranked the city as the 46th fastest growing city with a population of over 100,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2012/tables/CBSA-EST2012-01.csv |title=Table 1.

In 1908, Aurora adopted the nickname "City of Lights", because in 1881 it was one of the first cities in the United States to implement an all-electric street lighting system.<ref>Following [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and [[Wabash, Indiana]].{{cite web|title=About Our City |url=http://www.aurora-il.org/aboutourcity.php |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120729181648/http://www.aurora-il.org/aboutourcity.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 July 2012 |publisher=City of Aurora, IL |accessdate=25 September 2011 |year=2011 }}</ref> Aurora's historic downtown is located on the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]], and centered on [[Stolp Island]]. The city is divided into three regions, the West Side, on the west side of the Fox River, the East Side, between the eastern bank of the Fox River and the Kane/DuPage County line, and the Far East Side/Fox Valley, which is from the County Line to the city's eastern border with [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]].

The Aurora area has some significant architecture, including structures by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Bruce Goff]] and [[George Grant Elmslie]]. Aurora is also home to a large collection of [[Sears Catalog Home]]s (over 50 homes) and [[Lustron house|Lustron]] all-steel homes (seven homes). The Hollywood Casino Aurora, a dockside gaming facility with {{convert|53,000|sqft|m2}} and 1,200 gaming positions, is located along the river in downtown Aurora.

==History==
Before European settlers arrived, there was a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] village in what is today downtown Aurora, on the banks of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]]. In 1834, following the [[Black Hawk War]], the McCarty brothers arrived. They initially owned land on both sides of the river, but sold their lands to the Lake brothers on the west side. The Lake brothers opened a mill on the opposite side of the river. The McCartys lived and operated their mill on the east side.<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/91.html|title=Aurora, IL|website=www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210094756/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/91.html|archivedate=10 December 2008}}</ref> A post office was established in 1837, officially creating Aurora.

Aurora was originally two villages: East Aurora, incorporated in 1845,<ref name="genealogytrails.com">{{cite web|url=http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html|title=History of Aurora, Illinois|first=K.|last=Torp|website=genealogytrails.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120709131951/http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html|archivedate=9 July 2012}}</ref> on the east side of the river, and West Aurora, formally organized on the west side of the river in 1854.<ref name="genealogytrails.com"/> In 1857, the two towns joined officially, incorporated as the city of Aurora.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| url = http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html| title = Aurora Township, Kane County, Illinois| encyclopedia = Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois| publisher = Kane County Illinois Genealogy Trails| accessdate = 24 September 2011| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://archive.today/20120709131951/http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html| archivedate = 9 July 2012}}</ref> As representatives could not agree which side of the river should house the public buildings, most public buildings were built on or around [[Stolp Island]] in the middle of the river.

As the city grew, it attracted numerous factories and jobs. In 1856, the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] located its [[Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Roundhouse and Locomotive Shop|roundhouse and locomotive shop]] in Aurora, becoming the town's largest employer, a rank it held until the 1960s. Railroad restructuring in the railroad industry resulted in a loss of jobs as the number of railroads reduced and they dropped lines for passenger traffic. Aurora at one time had regularly scheduled passenger trains to Chicago.<ref>The Burlington Railroad ran passenger trains between Chicago and Aurora for over 100 years, since Aurora was an important suburb. See "Chicago-Aurora Centennial, 1864–1964" (Burlington Railroad, 1964).</ref>

The heavy industries on the East side provided employment for generations of European immigrants, who came from [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Romania]] and [[Italy]]. Aurora became the economic center of the [[Fox Valley (Illinois)|Fox Valley region]]. The combination of these three factors—a highly industrialized town, a sizable river that divided it, and the Burlington railroad's shops—accounted for much of the dynamics of Aurora's political, economic, and social history. The city openly supported [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] before the [[American Civil War]]. [[Mexico|Mexican]] migrants began arriving after the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910. Socially, the town was [[progressivism|progressive]] in its attitude toward education, religion, welfare, and women. The first free public school district in Illinois was established in 1851 here and the city established a high school for girls in 1855.

The city developed as a manufacturing powerhouse and continued until the early 1970s, when the railroad shops closed. Soon many other factories and industrial areas relocated or went out of business. By 1980, there were few industrial areas operating in the city, and unemployment soared to 16%.<ref name=Encyclopedia/> During the late 1970s and early 1980s, development began of the Far East side along the Eola Road and Route 59 areas. While this was financially beneficial to the city, it drew off retail businesses and manufacturing from downtown and the industrial sectors of the near East and West Sides, respectively, weakening them. In the mid-1980s crime rates soared and street gangs started to form.

During this time Aurora became a much more ethnically diverse city. The Latino population began to grow rapidly in the city in the 1980s. In the late 1980s, several business and industrial parks were established on the city's outskirts. In 1993, the Hollywood Casino was built downtown, which helped bring the first redevelopment to the downtown area in nearly twenty years. In the late 1990s, more development began in the rural areas and towns outside Aurora. Subdivisions sprouted up around the city, and Aurora's population soared.

Today, Aurora is an ethnically diverse city of around 200,000 residents. Historic areas downtown are being redeveloped, and new developments are being built all over the city.

While the city has traditionally been regarded as being in [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane County]], Aurora also includes parts of [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage]], [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall]] and [[Will County, Illinois|Will]] counties. Aurora is one of only three cities in Illinois that span four counties. (The others are [[Barrington Hills, Illinois|Barrington Hills]] and [[Centralia, Illinois|Centralia]].)

===Regions of Aurora===
Politically, the city is divided into 10 wards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aurora-il.org/documents/gis/other/wards2013.pdf |title=City of Aurora 2013 Ward Map |accessdate=2014-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626094644/https://www.aurora-il.org/documents/gis/other/wards2013.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-26 }}</ref> Aurora is commonly divided into three regions:{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

* The ''West Side'', which is west of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]].
* The ''East Side'', which spans the region east of the Fox River, stopping at the DuPage County line.
* ''Fox Valley'', also referred to as the ''Far East Side'', is the portion of Aurora east of the Dupage County line. Its name is deceptive because it is actually the part of the city ''farthest'' from the Fox River and its valley. The area acquired its name because of its proximity to the [[Fox Valley Mall]] and Fox Valley Villages, one of the first housing developments to be constructed after the mall.

===Climate===
The annual precipitation for Aurora is about 40&nbsp;inches. The record high for Aurora is {{convert|111|°F}}, on July 14, 1936. The record low is {{convert|−31|°F}}, on January 16, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=January 16, 2009: Cold Air Outbreak |url=https://www.weather.gov/lot/2009jan16 |website=www.weather.gov |publisher=US Department of Commerce NOAA |language=EN-US |date=January 16, 2009}}</ref> The average high temperature for Aurora in July is {{convert|83.5|°F}}, the average January low is {{convert|12.6|°F}}.

On July 17–18, 1996, a major flood struck Aurora, with {{convert|16.9|in|mm}} of rain in a 24-hour period, which is an Illinois state record, and the second highest ever nationally. Flooding occurred in almost every low-lying area in the city, and in neighborhoods bordering the Fox River, causing major damage in some neighborhoods. The flooding was just as bad in Blackberry Creek, on Aurora's far west side.

Aurora has not been struck by any major tornadoes in recent history, although they occur in Northern Illinois annually. In 1906, a tornado went through the [[Aurora Downs|Aurora Driving Park]], a large recreation/amusement park and race track where the Riddle Highlands neighborhood and Northgate shopping center is today. The tornado hit during the afternoon performance of the Ringling Brothers "Greatest Show on Earth" circus, when the park was crowded. It killed 2 people and injured 22, but the grandstand was still filled for the evening performance. Weak tornadoes struck the city in 1954, 1958, 1960, and 1991. In 1990, the supercell thunderstorm that produced the deadly [[1990 Plainfield tornado|Plainfield Tornado]] passed over the city, dropping golf ball sized hail and causing wind damage. Less than ten minutes after passing through Aurora, the storm produced an F5 tornado, which touched down in nearby Oswego, less than 5 miles from downtown. The tornado then traveled through Plainfield and Joliet, killing 29 people.

The city can receive heavy snowfall and experiences blizzards periodically.

Aurora was hit with one of the strongest earthquakes ever [[List of earthquakes in Illinois|to strike Illinois]], a M 5.1, on May 26, 1909. It put cracks through chimneys and could be felt {{convert|500000|sqmi|abbr=on}} around.

[[File:Paramount Theatre - panoramio.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Paramount Theatre, downtown Aurora.]]
[[Downtown]] Aurora is home to the [[Paramount Theatre (Aurora, Illinois)|Paramount Theatre]], a large live performance theater on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and the [[Hollywood Casino Aurora|Hollywood Casino]]. There is also the [[Leland Tower]], a former hotel which was the tallest building in Illinois outside of Chicago and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The largest collection of commercial buildings by [[Prairie School]] architect [[George Grant Elmslie]] is here. The main building of Aurora Public Library and a branch campus of [[Waubonsee Community College]] are also located downtown.

Downtown Alive, a festival that includes live music and a variety of food booths, is held on three weekends (Friday and Saturday night) in the summer; Blues on the Fox (featuring national blues artists) is held on the Friday and Saturday of Father's Day weekend. Roughly 8,000–13,000 people attend. The quarterly AuroraArtWalk is hosted by the [[Cultural Creatives]]—a grassroots team of local artist, property owners, patrons, and the City of Aurora. The Riverfront Playhouse is a not-for-profit theater that has held a storefront location in downtown Aurora since 1978.<ref>[http://www.riverfrontplayhouse.com Riverfront Playhouse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030414092901/http://www.riverfrontplayhouse.com/ |date=2003-04-14 }} Official Site</ref>

A fixture of Downtown Aurora, the Waubonsee Community College Campus, which was formerly located on Stolp Island near the Paramount Theatre, recently{{when|date=August 2013}} closed. A new and greatly expanded campus was built on the western banks of the river, between the river and IL Route 31. The construction of the campus was part of a larger plan to redevelop the Downtown area, putting in parks and new walking paths, and making the area more inviting. The plan also included a pedestrian bridge to connect the banks of the river. Also in the works is a plan to modify or reconstruct the bridges to Stolp Island, which have not been maintained for nearly 60 years.

}} Aurora has long been a regional transportation hub. The city is the final stop of the [[BNSF Railway Line|Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] line of the [[Metra]] commuter rail system, allowing rail service into [[Chicago]].  The city also has a stop at the [[Route 59 (Metra)|Rt. 59 station]] on the BNSF Line. This station is on the border with Naperville and each city maintains a parking lot on their respective side of the tracks. The [[BNSF Railroad]] owns and maintains a [[rail yard]] in Aurora, which they named Eola Yard.

[[Pace (transit)|Pace Suburban Bus]] operates local bus service in Aurora six days a week (no service on Sundays) and connects to cities and village such as Naperville, Geneva, Batavia, Oswego, and St. Charles. [[Metra]] trains and Pace buses stop at the [[Aurora (Metra)|Aurora Transportation Center]].

Aurora does not have a stop for [[Amtrak]] trains, as the old station closed in the 1980s. The closest Amtrak station is in [[Naperville station|Napervile]]. Aurora City Lines, the old city bus lines, was closed in the late 1980s in favor of regional bus service. Aurora also had an extensive [[Tram|streetcar]] system, operated by the [[Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric Company]], that served most neighborhoods. Aurora was served by a number of [[interurban]] lines, the most prominent of which was the [[Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad]] which provided service into Chicago. The [[Suburban Transit Access Route|STAR Line]] would have a third station at Ferry Rd. north of the BNSF Line.

The [[Aurora Municipal Airport (Illinois)|Aurora Municipal Airport]] is a general aviation airport in Sugar Grove, Illinois, just outside Aurora. Although the airport is in Sugar Grove, it is owned and operated by the City of Aurora. The Aurora Airport is designed as a reliever airport for Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports and also handles a lot of international cargo. It is capable of landing Boeing 757 aircraft. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center is on Aurora's west side.

===Healthcare===
[[File:Rush-Copley Medical Center.JPG|thumb|[[Rush–Copley Medical Center]]]]
Aurora has two hospitals, one on the west side, Presence Mercy Medical Center, and one in Fox Valley, [[Rush–Copley Medical Center]].

There are other area hospitals, including Edward Hospital in Naperville, Delnor Hospital in Geneva, Central DuPage in Winfield and a Level 1 Trauma center at Good Samaritan in Downers Grove.

Aurora had three hospitals, St. Joseph Hospital, on the west side, St. Charles hospital, east of downtown, and Copley Memorial Hospital, on the east side. St Joseph and St, Charles hospitals have been converted into senior living centers, and the old Copley hospital, which was one of the largest hospitals in the area, sits vacant. The city of Aurora recently demolished the old smokestacks from the hospital, as they were starting to crumble.

[https://archive.today/20130110200534/http://www.dreyermed.com/ Dreyer Medical Clinic] and several other independent clinics and medical groups are spread throughout the city. The area surrounding Provena Mercy has evolved into a diverse healthcare district with services and offices.

==Education==
{{See also|Public school systems in Aurora, Illinois}}
The city is home to [[Aurora University]], two branches of [[Waubonsee Community College]], and a branch of [[Rasmussen College]]. According to the census of Aurora's population over the age of twenty-five, 26% hold a bachelor's degree.

Starting in the 1860s, Aurora was served by two main school systems, one on either side of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]], which physically divides the city. In the mid-20th century, the district on the western side of the river expanded to include the students in the village of North Aurora, including the North Aurorans on the east side of the Fox.  Additionally, in 1972, the Indian Prairie School District (IPSD) 204 was formed to serve the far eastern portion of Aurora within [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]]. All three districts (Aurora Public Schools: West Side (District 129), Aurora Public Schools: East Side (District 131) and IPSD) have their headquarters and administrative offices within the Aurora city limits. As of 2005, there were at least forty public schools within Aurora city limits, serving residents of Aurora and neighboring communities.

Due to the city's size, these are not the only three school systems serving residents – some students in the far north end of the city (north of [[Interstate 88 (west)|I88]] in Kane County) attend [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]] public schools, some on the far southwest side attend Kaneland CUSD 302 schools (headquartered in [[Maple Park, Illinois|Maple Park]]), and some students in the far south end of the city (a small corner of the Kane, Kendall and Will County portions) attend [[Oswego, Illinois|Oswego]] public schools. Four of the schools in Oswego CUSD 308, Wheatlands Elementary, Homestead Elementary, Wolf's Crossing Elementary, and Bednarcik Junior High are within Aurora's limits.

The [[Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy]] (IMSA) is a state-funded residential [[magnet school]] for grades 10 to 12. While IMSA operates under public funds (and uses the site originally designated West Aurora High School North Campus), it is managed independently of Aurora's other public schools. Any Illinois student who meets admission requirements may apply to attend IMSA, tuition free.

Aurora is also home to other private schools. Within Aurora, there are three Roman Catholic High Schools, [[Aurora Central Catholic High School|Aurora Central Catholic]] (Diocese of Rockford), [[Rosary High School (Aurora, Illinois)|Rosary]], and [[Marmion Academy]] (Order of St. Benedict), and seven Catholic elementary schools operated by the Diocese of Rockford. Along with these three schools is [[Aurora Christian High School]] and Elementary School and Resurrection Lutheran School,<ref>{{cite web |title=Resurrection Lutheran Church & School |url=https://relcs.org/}}</ref> a Pre-K-8 grade school of the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]].  Aurora is also home to Fox Valley Montessori School, one of the first Montessori schools established in Illinois in 1969, which offers a preschool and elementary program.

The above-named districts have forty-six public schools within the city limits of Aurora (seventeen for District #131, thirteen for District #129, eleven for District #204, four for Oswego District #308 and the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy).

===Library===
The [[Aurora Public Library (Illinois)|Aurora Public Library]] includes the main library, two branches, an express center, a support facility and a bookmobile. The library operations budget is $10 million and the staff numbers 85 full-time and 89 part-time employees. The library was funded in 1901 through a Carnegie grant. The Santori Public Library, the main library, was opened in June 2015, and offers a 3D printer and a digital media lab in addition to standard book and media services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santorilibrary.com/santori-public-library/|title=Santori Public Library|website=santorilibrary.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305024529/http://www.santorilibrary.com/santori-public-library/|archivedate=5 March 2016}}</ref>

Like other large Midwestern cities that once relied on manufacturing as an economic basis, Aurora has a large number of abandoned buildings and vacant lots, especially in older sections of the city. Efforts are ongoing to rehabilitate these areas.

Environmentally, Aurora has long dealt with pollution of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]]. The river was heavily polluted up until the 1970s by factories that had lined the river for over a century. Cleanup efforts have been successful with the help of state grants and volunteer efforts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Illinois EPA Director presents $300,000 grant to Mayor of Aurora for watershed protection efforts |url=http://www.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=18&RecNum=5880 |publisher=State of Illinois |work=Illinois Government News Network |date=23 April 2007 |accessdate=25 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402054109/http://www.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=18&RecNum=5880 |archivedate=2 April 2012 }}</ref>
