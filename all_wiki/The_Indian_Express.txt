'''''The Indian Express''''' is an English-language Indian daily newspaper. It is published in Mumbai by [[Indian Express Limited|Indian Express Group]]. In 1999, eight years after the group's founder [[Ramnath Goenka]]'s death in 1991,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ramnath Goenka|url=https://indianexpress.com/|access-date=2020-07-06|website=The Indian Express|language=en}}</ref> the group was split between the family members. The southern editions took the name ''[[The New Indian Express]]'', while the northern editions, based in [[Mumbai]], retained the original ''Indian Express'' name with ''"The"'' prefixed to the title.

''The Indian Express'' is published at eleven locations: [[Delhi]], [[Jaipur]], [[Mumbai]], [[Nagpur]], [[Pune]], [[Kolkata]], [[Vadodara]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Lucknow]], [[Ahmedabad]], and [[Tirupati]].

==History==

*In 1932, the ''Indian Express'' was started by an [[Ayurvedic]] doctor, [[P. Varadarajulu Naidu]], at [[Chennai]], being published by his "Tamil Nadu" press. Soon under financial difficulties, he sold the newspaper to [[Swaminathan Sadanand]], the founder of ''[[The Free Press Journal]]'', a national [[news agency]].
*In 1933, the ''Indian Express'' opened its second office in [[Madurai]], launching the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] edition, ''[[Dinamani]]''.  Sadanand introduced several innovations and reduced the price of the newspaper. Faced with financial difficulties, he sold a part of his stake to Ramanath Goenka as [[convertible debenture]]s.
*In 1935, when ''The Free Press Journal'' finally collapsed, and after a protracted court battle with Goenka, Sadanand lost ownership of ''Indian Express''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaminsky|first=Arnold|title=India Today- an encyclopedia of life in the republic|page=340|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWDnTWrz4O8C&pg=PA340}}</ref>

Later Goenka bought the remaining 26% of the company held by Sadanand. The newspaper then came under Goenka's sole control, taking the already anti-establishment tone of the paper to greater heights. Also at that time, it faced stiff competition from the well established ''[[The Hindu]]'' and the ''Mail'', as well as several other prominent newspapers.
In the late 1930s the newspaper's circulation was no more than 2000.

In 1939 Goenka bought ''[[Andhra Prabha]]'', another prominent [[Telugu language|Telugu]] daily newspaper. The name [[Three Musketeers]] was often used for the three dailies namely, Indian Express, Dinamani and Andhra Prabha.
In 1940 the whole premises was gutted by fire. ''[[The Hindu]]'', a rival newspaper, helped considerably in re-launching the paper, by getting it printed temporarily at one of its Swadesimithran's press and later offering its recently vacated premises at 2, Mount Road, on rent to Goenka, which later became the landmark Express Estates.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://madrasminutes.com/2017/11/06/1940-the-year-of-fires/|title=1940 – The year of Fires|last=madrasminutes|date=2017-11-06|website=Madras Minutes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809053346/https://madrasminutes.com/2017/11/06/1940-the-year-of-fires/|archivedate=2020-08-09|access-date=2020-04-10}}{{unreliable source|date=September 2020}}</ref> This relocation also helped the Express obtain better high speed printing machines. The district judge who did inquiry into the fire concluded that a short circuit or a cigarette butt could have ignited the fire and said that the growing city had inadequate fire control support.<ref name=":0" />

In 1952, the paper had a circulation of 44,469.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mani |first1=A. D. |title=The Indian Press Today |journal=Far Eastern Survey |date=2 July 1952 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=109–113 |doi=10.2307/3023864 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3023864 |publisher=[[Institute of Pacific Relations]] |issn=0362-8949}}</ref>

In later years, Goenka started the [[Mumbai]] edition with the landmark [[Express Towers]] as his office when he bought the ''Morning Standard'' in 1944. Two years later it became the Mumbai edition of ''Indian Express''. Later, editions were started in several cities; the [[Madurai]] edition in 1957, the [[Bangalore]] edition in 1965, and the [[Ahmedabad]] edition in 1968. ''[[The Financial Express (India)|The Financial Express]]'' was launched in 1961 at Mumbai, [[Kannada Prabha]] ([[Kannada language|Kannada]] daily) at [[Bangalore]] in 1965 and a Bangalore edition of the Telugu daily ''Andhra Prabha'', [[Marathi language|Marathi]] daily ''Loksatta'' from Mumbai in 1948 and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] daily ''Jansatta'', from Ahmedabad and Vadodara in 1952.

The [[Delhi]] edition started was when the Tej group's ''Indian News Chronicle'' was acquired in 1951, which in 1953 became the Delhi edition of ''Indian Express''. In 1990 the group bought the Sterling group of magazines, along with it the [[Gentleman (magazine)|''Gentleman'' magazine]].

After Ramnath Goenka's death in 1991, two of the grandsons, Manoj Kumar Sonthalia and Vivek Goenka split the group into two. Indian Express Mumbai with all the North Indian editions went to Vivek Goenka, and all the Southern editions which were grouped as Express Publications Madurai Limited with [[Chennai]] as headquarters went to MK Sonthalia.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/61205/|title=Manoj Kumar Sonthalia vs Vivek Goenka And Ors. on 9 March, 1995|website=indiankanoon.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawyerservices.in/Manoj-Kumar-Sonthalia-Versus-Vivek-Goenka-and-Others-1995-03-09|title=Manoj Kumar Sonthalia v Vivek Goenka and Others on 09 March 1995 - Judgement - LawyerServices|website=www.lawyerservices.in|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> A trust was started for MK Sonthalia's brother, Anil Kumar Sonthalia, the third grandson of RN Goenka, who was said to be mentally retarded, with a deposit of Rs. 1 crore following the Madras High Court Judgment on 9 March 1995.<ref name=":1" />

''Indian Express'' began publishing daily on the [[internet]] on 8 July 1996. Five months later, the website ''expressindia.com'' attracted "700,000 hits every day, excepting weekends when it fell to 60% of its normal levels".<ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Express - Awards |url=http://www.expressindia.com/about/AWARDS.HTM |website=The Indian Express |accessdate=18 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970415041105/http://www.expressindia.com/about/AWARDS.HTM |archivedate=15 April 1997}}</ref>

It is a popular newspaper among UPSC CSE aspirants along with [[The Hindu]].

The [[Indian Express Limited|Indian Express Group]] has a Mumbai-headquartered division, which should not be confused with Express Publications [[Madurai]], which has a [[South India]]n chain of newspapers, including ''[[The New Indian Express]]'' a separate corporate entity from The Express Group. The Indian Express main newsroom is in Noida. Mumbai is a bureau. A national desk brings out all editions in Delhi. The management, however, still sits in Mumbai.
