The '''University of Bath''' is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in [[Bath, Somerset]], United Kingdom. It received its [[Royal Charter|royal charter]] in 1966, along with a [[Plate glass university|number of other institutions]] following the [[Robbins Report]]. Like the [[University of Bristol]] and [[University of the West of England]], Bath can trace its roots to the Merchant Venturers' Technical College, established in Bristol as a school in 1595 by the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]]. The university's main campus is located on [[Claverton Down]], a site overlooking the city of Bath, and was purpose-built, constructed from 1964 in the [[modernist]] style of the time.

In the 2014 [[Research Excellence Framework]], 32% of Bath's submitted research activity achieved the highest possible classification of 4*, defined as world-leading in terms of originality, significance and rigour. 87% was graded 4*/3*, defined as world-leading/internationally excellent.<ref name="REF results">{{cite web|url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/ByHei/107 |title=REF results |publisher=HEFCE |date=18 December 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref> The annual income of the institution for 2017–18 was £287.9&nbsp;million of which £37.0&nbsp;million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £283.1&nbsp;million.<ref name="Bath Financial Statement 17/18"/>

The university is a member of the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]], the [[Association of MBAs]], the [[European Quality Improvement System]], the [[European University Association]], [[Universities UK]] and [[GW4 (universities)|GW4]].

==History==
The University of Bath can trace its roots to the Merchant Venturers' Technical College (whose alumni include the physicists [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Peter Higgs]]), an institution founded as a school in 1595<ref>{{cite web|title=Education|url=http://merchantventurers.com/charitable-activities/education/|publisher=Merchant Venturers|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> and a [[technical school]] established in [[Bristol]] in 1856 which became part of the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] in 1885. Meanwhile, in the neighbouring city of Bath, a [[Pharmacy|pharmaceutical]] school, the Bath School of Pharmacy, was founded in 1907. This became part of the Technical College in 1929.

The college came under the control of the Bristol Education Authority in 1949; it was renamed then the Bristol College of Technology, and in 1960 the Bristol College of Science and Technology, when it became one of ten technical colleges under the umbrella of the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]]. The college was mainly housed in the former [[New Orphan Houses, Ashley Down, Bristol|Muller's Orphanage]] at [[Ashley, Bristol|Ashley Down]] in Bristol, which still houses part of the [[City of Bristol College]] whilst the remainder has been converted into residential housing.

===University status===
In 1963, the [[Robbins Report|Robbins Committee report]] paved the way for the college (along with a [[Plate glass university|number of other institutions]]) to assume university status as ''Bath University of Technology''.

Although the grounds of [[Kings Weston House]], in Bristol, were briefly considered&nbsp;— which then, and until 1969, accommodated the College's School of Architecture and Building Engineering&nbsp;— the City of Bristol was unable to offer the expanding college an appropriately sized single site. Following discussions between the College Principal and the Director of Education in Bath, an agreement was reached to provide the college with a new home in [[Claverton Down]], Bath, on a [[greenfield land|greenfield site]], purchased through a compulsory purchase order from the Candy family of Norwood Farm, overlooking the city.

Construction of the purpose-built campus began in 1964, with the first building, now known as 4 South, completed in 1965, and the [[Royal Charter]] was granted in 1966. In November 1966, the first degree ceremony took place at the [[Bath Assembly Rooms|Assembly Rooms]] in Bath.  Over the subsequent decade, new buildings were added as the campus took shape.

In the mid-19th century, there were plans to build a college on the site.<ref>{{cite web |title=The story of the University |url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/corporate-information/the-story-of-the-university/ |publisher=University of Bath |accessdate=5 August 2018}}</ref>

Until 30 October 2012, it was also a member of the [[1994 Group]].

A report by the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] into governance at the University was published on 20 November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/staffpay/bath/|title=The report of a HEFCE enquiry into governance surrounding senior pay at the University of Bath was published on 20 November 2017.|website=HEFCE|access-date=}}</ref>

===Controversies===

In November 2017, frustration with the governance of the university grew, especially concerning the Vice Chancellor, [[Glynis Breakwell]]'s remuneration.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/news/bath-news/university-bath-given-13-recommendations-806017|title=University of Bath given 13 recommendations after investigation|last=Brown|first=Alexander|date=20 November 2017|work=bathchronicle|access-date=27 November 2017}}</ref> The [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|HEFCE]] carried out an enquiry and recommended 13 changes to the governance of the university.<ref name=":0" /> In November 2017, Breakwell's salary rose by 3.9% (£17,589) to over £468,000 and she was reported as the highest paid Vice Chancellor in the country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/news/another-pay-rise-countrys-highest-799402|title=Another pay rise for highest-earning university boss|last=Petherick|first=Sam|date=19 November 2017|work=bathchronicle|access-date=27 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/news/bath-news/university-bath-vice-chancellor-pay-695907|title=Bath vice-chancellor pay row timeline|first=Sam|last=Petherick-bath|date=29 October 2017|website=bathchronicle}}</ref>

On 5 March 2018, at 13:30, a group of 10 Bath students supporting the [[University and College Union|UCU]] strike action occupied the vice chancellor's suite in protest of the university's support for [[2018 UK higher education strike|UUK's proposed pension reforms]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesubath.com/404/?url=/campaigns/ucustrike/|website=www.thesubath.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/news/bath-news/live-student-occupation-university-bath-1301627|title=Students occupation outside Bath vice-chancellor suite enters fourth day|first=Sam|last=Petherick-bath|date=9 March 2018|website=bathchronicle}}</ref> The occupation was endorsed by Bath MP [[Wera Hobhouse]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Wera_Hobhouse/status/971808117087440897|title=Thanks to @Bath_Students for hosting me at their occupation in support of @UCUBath.

==Campus and facilities==
[[File:Uni.of.bath.campus.arp.jpg|thumb|The Parade, a central pedestrian thoroughfare connecting most academic blocks]]

[[File:The Library, University of Bath - geograph.org.uk - 795438.jpg|thumb|The library]]

===Main campus===
The university's main campus is located on [[Claverton Down]],<ref>{{cite web |title=University of Bath, Claverton Down campus |url=https://www.bath.ac.uk/locations/university-of-bath-claverton-down-campus/ |publisher=University of Bath}}</ref> approximately 1.5 miles from the centre of Bath. The site is compact; it is possible to walk from one end to the other in fifteen minutes. The design involved the separation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, with road traffic on the ground floors and pedestrians on a raised central thoroughfare, known as the Parade. Buildings would line the parade and student residences built on tower blocks rise from the central thoroughfare. Such plans were mostly followed.

At the centre of the campus is the Library and Learning Centre, a facility open round the clock offering computing services, information and research assistance as well as books and journals. A number of outlets are housed around the parade, including restaurants, bars and fast-food cafés, plus two banks, a union shop and two small supermarkets, as well as academic blocks. Building names are based on their location and distance vis-à-vis the library (e.g. 1 East, 2 East). Odd-numbered buildings are on the same side of the parade as the Library, and even-numbered buildings are on the opposite side.

Buildings along the east-west axis are mostly directly accessible from the parade, which is generally considered to be "level two", but later additions, such as 7 West, 9 West, 3 West North and 8 East, follow the rule less strictly. 7 West is generally accessible only via 5 West or 9 West, and 3 West North, 9 West and 8 East have entrances at ground level at varying distances from the main parade. Buildings on the south of the campus, 1 South to 4 South, are accessible via roads and pedestrian walkways by the university lake and gardens.

Buildings, as in many of the so-called [[Plate Glass University|plate glass universities]], were constructed in a functional modernist style using concrete, although such designs were later derided for lacking the charm of the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Red Brick university|red-brick universities]] or the [[Ancient Universities|ancient and medieval]] ones. In Bath, there is a particular contrast between the concrete campus and the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian style]] architecture of the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage City]] of Bath.

The eastern part of the campus is dominated by the Sports Training Village, built in 1992 and enhanced in 2003 with an extension.

The northern perimeter of the university is bounded by student residences Brendon Court, Eastwood, Marlborough Court, Solsbury Court, Norwood House, Osborne House, Polden Court, The Quads, Westwood, and Woodland Court. The original plan for students to be housed in tower blocks above the parade continues with the small number of rooms (110) in Norwood House. However, the second tower block, Wessex House, now hosts offices rather than residences.

The university also owns buildings in the city of Bath, mostly student accommodation dotted around town, including Canal Wharf, Carpenter House, Clevelands Building, John Wood Building and John Wood Court, Pulteney Court and Thornbank Gardens.

There is also an Innovation Centre that provides work space, practical support and expertise to local technology enterprises and entrepreneurial companies that emerge from the university's student and academic research base

Two new buildings were opened in 2017. The Virgil Building, adapted from a former police station, offers a hub and support for students and staff in the centre of Bath, including professional, counselling and careers services, Joblink, a skills centre and learning commons. The university also opened a centre at 83 Pall Mall in central London, with a stated aim of building partnerships and engaging with business, politics and Bath's alumni community in the UK's capital.

Over several years, the grounds have received recognition for their outstanding beauty with awards from Bath in Bloom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/environmentandplanning/parksandopenspaces/Bath+in+Bloom+Competition.htm |title=Bath in Bloom Competition |publisher=BANES Council |accessdate=14 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503163545/http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/environmentandplanning/parksandopenspaces/Bath%2Bin%2BBloom%2BCompetition.htm |archivedate= 3 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Campus developments===
The university continually upgrades its Claverton Down campus with new teaching blocks. A proposal to move the boundary of the [[green belt]] away to the edge of the campus to facilitate further development was agreed in October 2007 by the [[Bath and North East Somerset|local council]] following a public inquiry, although the boundary of the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty still crosses the site. In July 2005, building 3 West North (officially opened on 27 October) was completed. The deconstruction of the [[asbestos]]-contaminated 4 West was completed in mid-2005 and the 4 West building opened in April 2010, providing additional teaching and office space.
